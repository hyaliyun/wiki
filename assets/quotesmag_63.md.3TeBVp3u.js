Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Chief Detective Inspector Bill Reade described this as an honour killing, and the prosecutors stated she was murdered for trying to achieve independence from her husband and undergoing westernisation. Rania's remains have never been found. Background Rania was of Palestinian descent, she grew up in refugee camps in Syria where she met her husband Ahmed Al-Khatib, marrying him at aged 15. Al-Khatib, who was a blacksmith by trade and nine years older than Rania, was noted as being violent towards her from an early stage. In February 2005, the couple moved to the United Kingdom, first settling in Norton, Teeside, before moving to Manchester. According to testimony at Manchester Crown Court, following the move to England Al-Khatib became increasingly jealous and controlling of Rania and subjected her to years of domestic and sexual violence. In January 2013, she reported him to the police for domestic abuse, obtained a non-molestation order and moved into a homeless hostel, from where she and her children were subsequently rehoused in Cheetham Hill, March 2013. After the separation she took English classes at Openshaw College, made new friends and \\"embraced\\" her new life; Al-Khatib resided with family in nearby Gorton. The couple had three children, two boys and a girl and had been separated for only a few months at the time of her death, at age 25. Crime and burial On 7 June 2013, at the instigation of her estranged husband, Rania went to her brother-in-law's home in Salford, according to Al-Khatib, she was to leave their children with him for the weekend and discuss plans for childcare. Prior to Rania's arrival, Al- Khatib's brother Muhanned had sent his partner and children away from the property and around 45 minutes after Rania arrived was seen leaving the property himself, taking her children with him. Al-Khatib departed shortly thereafter, wearing some of Rania's clothing in an attempt to give the impression that she'd left the property alive. On his return, he put her body in a suitcase, which was then transported in Muhanned's motorhome, and moved to an unknown burial site. After Al-Khatib had killed Rania, he accessed her social media accounts and sent messages to her family pretending to be her and claiming to have moved to Turkey. His brother, Muhanned, gave her mobile phone to an acquaintance who was travelling to Turkey and had them text her father from there to say that she was getting remarried. Friends raised concerns about Rania's welfare when she didn't turn up for a meeting on 8 June and this information was passed from Cleveland Police to Greater Manchester Police on 9 June. However, it wasn't until 2 July, and following a phone call from her uncle in Lebanon, that she was officially treated as a missing person. When questioned on 3 July 2013, Al-Khatib claimed that he hadn't seen Rania for months and that he thought she was living in Turkey or Syria, but he was duly arrested on 4 July on suspicion of murder and, shortly thereafter, his brother Muhanned contacted police and admitted that Rania was dead. He claimed that her remains were buried near a layby along the A19 and Al-Khatib gave a similar version, stating that he'd buried her near to the A19 in Thirsk. The search for Rania's remains encompassed a 19-mile stretch of the A19 and involved two police forces, teams from the Royal Engineers and RAF, along with specialist sniffer dogs, forensic botanists and archaeologists. The search was called off in September 2013, without success.  Trial and punishment  Ahmed Al-Khatib went on trial, alongside his brothers Hussain and Muhanned, at Manchester Crown Court in April 2014. He presented the partial defence of diminished responsibility, claiming that he was mentally ill and had killed Rania in self-defence when she appeared to him in the form of an \\"evil apparition\\", or djinn. Throughout the trial, in an attempt to convince the jury that he was ill, he rocked back and forth, banged his head repeatedly against the dock and attacked both an interpreter and his brother. His defence was rejected and he was found guilty of murder, with the Judge stating: He received a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 20 years. In addition he pleaded guilty to \\"perverting the course of justice\\" for moving the body out of view of the authorities. Muhanned Al-Khatib was acquitted of murder; he pleaded guilty to \\"intending to pervert the course of justice\\". His sentence was discounted to three years in jail because information he gave assisted in the successful prosecution of his brothers. Hussain Al-Khatib was convicted of \\"intending to pervert the course of justice\\" and jailed for four years.  Aftermath  Rania's case was one of three in 2013 which came within the jurisdiction of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and in which a known victim of domestic abuse was murdered by their partner. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which took more than four years to complete its investigation, found ‚Äòvery serious concerns‚Äô and \\"recurring systems issues\\" in the way GMP handled domestic violence cases. Various GMP staff investigated over their handling of Rania's case were found to have displayed \\"poor\\" or \\"unsatisfactory\\" performance by the IPCC. None, however, were disciplined for misconduct.

Playback, January 31, 2019. The series is primarily filmed in Montreal, with some limited location shooting in Toronto for establishing shots and other scenes which require a clear Toronto geographic marker. International broadcast In May 2020, NBC acquired the U.S. broadcast rights for the series; it premiered on September 1, 2020, filling a timeslot usually held by its own medical drama New Amsterdam (whose next season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic). In New Zealand, the series is available for streaming on TVNZ OnDemand. In French Canada, the series airs on Vrak. Reception Critical response John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the show's positioning of Bash as an immigrant struggling for acceptance in his adopted country set the show apart from other medical dramas: \\"The plot device that kick-starts the series‚Äîand Episode 1 sure comes with a kick‚Äîmight seem ludicrous, but it gets your attention and signals what themes in Transplant are about to blossom. It's about the terror and frustrations that immigrants experience, trying to use their skills in a new country. Much is made of Bashir's knowledge and knowhow being heightened by his experience working in a war zone with few resources. He can intuit medical problems and injuries faster than most of his colleagues. This does not, however, make him either distinctly heroic or arrogant. Given his situation, he's actually an extremely vulnerable man. He's not the irascible Dr. House, nor is he the spookily wise young virtuoso at the heart of The Good Doctor.\\" He praised the series and Haq's lead performance in particular, ultimately concluding that \\"There are numerous medical dramas that move with a breathless, hectic pace and then stop for some romance or heart-warming moments. Transplant has some of that, but there is an astutely Canadian spin on the familiar. It gives grim articulation to the issues of immigration and the harried, under pressure immigrant experience. It's not entirely original, but certainly superior to the usual and disarmingly different.\\"John Doyle, \\"Transplant: A medical drama with its own energy and voice\\". The Globe and Mail, February 26, 2020. For etalk, Christine Estima also favourably reviewed many aspects of the show, giving special praise to its choice to avoid positioning its two female doctors, June and Magalie, as competitive rivals, instead presenting them simply as doctors who respect and support each other even if they don't always agree.Christine Estima, \\"The premiere episode of 'Transplant' confirms it's a must-watch medical drama: Not for the faint of heart, but it will also fill your heart\\", eTalk, February 26, 2020.

The Hollywood Reporter observed that it was \\"not a hugely innovative or adventurous medical drama\\" and had a \\"heavy reliance on that House trope of a loved one bringing in a patient, only to have the loved one be the one with the actual medical mystery\\", but that Hamed was \\"an interesting main character\\" and Haq was a \\"solid leading man, giving Bashir a frazzled soulfulness, but never making him saintly\\". In conclusion, it was felt that \\"in a fall in which the broadcast drama slate is populated mostly by mediocre acquisitions and dismal holdovers from last midseason, there's value to an above average new show like Transplant.\\" References External links * Category:Canadian medical television series Category:CTV Television Network original programming Category:2020 Canadian television series debuts Category:2020s Canadian drama television series Category:Television shows set in Toronto Category:Television series produced in Montreal Category:Television series by Universal Television ","title":"Transplant (TV series)"},{"id":"62526528","text":"Phytomyza hellebori is a species of leaf miner fly in the family Agromyzidae.

It is part of Harling United Benefice, a group of five churches that also includes, St Andrew, Brettenham, St Mary, Bridgham, St Ethelbert, Larling and St John the Evangelist, Rushford. History The nave with single hammerbeam roof, looking west from the chancel The lady chapel with canopied parclose screen A church is record here in the Domesday Book, suggesting continued worship for a millennium. The core of the building, including various windows and doorways, as well as the brickwork of the spire, date from between 1300 and 1340. Sir Robert Herling, who's tomb features in the Lady Chapel, made an initial donation. His daughter, Lady Anne Herling, and her two husbands, William Chamberlain and Sir Robert Wingfield, continued the transformation of the church throughout the 15th century. Most of the building work was complete in the middle of the 15th century, the east window arrived in the latter half, and the tower's parapet and spire towards the end. This fl√®che spire inspired G.E. Street's for St Peter Mancroft in 1882. The Herling emblems, including unicorns, birds, baskets and a quiver of feathers, feature throughout the church. A major restoration in 1871, costing ¬£1500, replaced the box-pews with the current pews, gave the chancel roof a simple scissorbeam design, and restored the main roof and spire. Exterior The buttressed walls are flint with ashlar dressings. The roof is lead, as is the spire which is itself supported by eight flying butresses. The porch has knapped flint and stone flushwork panelling. The western tower features arched two-light belfry windows on each of its four sides. The churchyard was bounded by a flint wall in 1829 and was extended to the north in 1928. Most of the headstones in the churchyard date from the 18th century onwards. The lychgate was taken in 1977 from West Harling Church to form a new entrance. Interior At the west end is the tower, with a spiral staircase of 73 steps to the ringer's gallery. This also contains the clock mechanism, which was made in 1826 for West Harling Hall, brought here in 1933, and restored in 2004. The nave roof is a fine single hammerbeam design, steeply pitched to 45 feet (13.7 metres). Twenty angel corbels support the wallposts of this roof. The spandrels linking the hammerbeams and wallposts are delicately carved with different designs. A collar beam at the roof's east end once supported a pulley for the rowell light. The north aisle, at 20.5 feet (6.2 metres), is wider than south, which is only 12 feet (3.7 metres) wide. The aisles and nave are distinguished by tall arcades with quatrefoil piers forming five bays on each side. In the centre of the west end of the nave is a large mediaeval octagonal stone font, with fine carvings and a dark wood cover that dates from the 1600s. Nearby are a stone holy water stoup and on the wall a medallion of Sir Thomas Lovell (died 1524), who was Chancellor of the Exchequer to Henry VII and Henry VIII and who built East Harling Manor. The medallion is a plaster replica of a bronze bust (in Westminster Abbey) by Pietro Torrigiano. Also in this area, at the back of the seating, are two sections of mediaeval screenwork. The panels came from the lower wall and gates of a rood screen, and were moved here in 1973. The woodwork, with green, red and gold, is intricately carved with Biblical scenes and the Herling unicorn. A rare mediaeval church lectern was lost during the 19th century restoration. The current wooden lectern has the form of a large eagle and was donated in 1879 by Elizabeth Norton. The 19th century pulpit was originally from another church and moved here around 1982. The original box pew seating was replaced by pine benches in 1871. These have finely carved ends that reproduce the earlier designs. Lady chapel At the south east of the nave is the lady chapel, which also contains two tombs. This is separated from the nave by a parclose screen. The north facing section of this screen is 14th century, with three-light openings and faded red and green colouring. The west-facing canopied section was once part of a rood screen, and is red, green and gold, with a dark blue sky and gold stars. The Herling unicorn features, as do human faces, dragons and owls. Along the very top are a row of 25 small lion heads with their tongues out. The lady chapel contains four benches, an altar table and communion rail. Chancel In the chancel are two sets of misericord stalls: the north set has two seats and the south four. These date from the 15th century, with 19th century restoration. The seats, when tipped up, reveal a structure upon which one may partially support oneself during long prayers. The face of this structure bears coats of arms. Each armrest has the carving of a beast clinging to it. These are *South (east to west) **A hairy bearded man with sword and shield **A wyvern **An old lioness **An eagle **A unicorn *North (east to west) **A griffin **A pelican in her piety **A lion The high altar at the eastern end of the chancel is flanked by two tombs. Parishioners lining up at the communion rail may examine the fine mediaeval stained glass in the east window. To the north of the chancel, is St Anne's Chapel and the Jesus Chapel. The latter once formed the ground floor of a two-storey sacristy and was formerly used as the parish schoolroom. This chapel for small services has its own communion rail, carved wooden altar and two chairs. Organ The organ was made by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1854 for St James' Church in Hatcham, London. When that church closed, the organ was moved here in 1982 and rebuilt. The small organ it replaced was transferred to Binham Priory church. The organ console and small set of pipes face south into the centre of the church while a larger set of pipes face west down the north aisle. The console, action and playing aids were refurbished and extended in 2012. It has 35 speaking stops across two manuals and pedals. Bells The church has a ring of eight bells (six until 1992). *Treble and 2nd bells. Cast by Mears & Stainbank of Whitechapel in 1908 for St John de Sepulchre, Norwich, and rehung here in 1992. *3rd and 4th bells. Cast by Thomas Gardiner of Norwich in 1746. *5th bell. Cast by Christopher Grave of Haddenham, near Ely. *6th bell. Cast by John Darbie of Ipswich in 1677, and recast by Taylor's of Loughborough in 1912. *7th bell. Cast by John Draper of Thetford in 1616, and also recast by Taylor's of Loughborough in 1912. *Tenor bell. Cast in Norwich around 1520. It weighs . Tombs The church contains five tombs or monuments featuring the Herling (also spelled Harling) and Lovell families. *The oldest tomb is of Sir Robert Herling (died 1435), and Lady Joan. The tomb chest is recessed in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. A Purbeck marble tomb-slab supports two alabaster figures: a knight and a lady. These figures are thought to be late 14th century, possibly from an earlier tomb for parents or grandparents. Overhead is an elaborate canopy with fine stone carving, including coat of arms. *The Easter Sepulchre forms a window between the chancel and St Anne's Chapel. It also serves as the tomb of Lady Anne Herling (died 1498), daughter of Sir Robert Herling, and her first husband, Sir William Chamberlain (died 1462). Sir William also appears in the bottom right of the Eastern Window. Atop the Easter Sepulchre in the chancel-side is Sir William Chamberlain's coat of arms. Anne's coat of arms features on the top of the chapel side. *At the north of the chancel is the tomb of Sir Francis Lovell (died 1550) and Dame Ann (died 1551). Sir Francis was nephew and heir of Sir Thomas Lovell (died 1524). Three coats of arms feature at the top and on the face of the tomb-chest. A morion helmet hangs on the wall above this tomb. *In matching style, at the south of the chancel is the tomb of the son of Sir Francis, another Sir Thomas Lovell (died 1557) and Dame Elizabeth (died 1591). Again three coats of arms feature at the top and on the face of the tomb-chest. A bascinet helmet hangs on the wall above this tomb. *In the Lady Chapel, is the elaborate tomb of yet another Sir Thomas Lovell (died 1604) and Dame Alice (died 1602). Painted and gilded effigies lie atop the tomb-chest, their hands clasped in prayer. Sir Thomas's head rests on his helmet, which is identical to a helmet that hangs on the wall above the tomb, and at his feet is a peacock's feathers. Alice's head lies on a cushion and at her feet is a Saracen's scalp, held up by a pair of arms. The canopy is supported by three Corinthian columns and topped with three black obelisks. Many coats of arms feature in the canopy and face of the tomb-chest. East window East window The mediaeval stained glass east window dates largely from the middle fifteenth century, with the top lights containing foliage patterns from the nineteenth century. Twenty main panels in total with 16 depicting scenes from the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries of Mary, two contain fragments, and two depict donors. {  + Main panels -  Annunciation  Visitation  Nativity  Adoration of the Shepherds  Adoration of the Magi -  Fragments  Presentation in the Temple  Finding in the Temple  Wedding at Cana  Fragments -  Mary of Magdala  The Betrayal at Gethsemane  Crucifixion  Descent from the Cross  Assumption of Mary -  Sir Robert Wingfield Anne Harling's 2nd husband, d.1480  Resurrection of Jesus  Ascension of Jesus  Descent of the Holy Spirit  Sir William Chamberlain Anne Harling's 1st husband, d.1462 } The windows panels have twice been removed from the church. First, to East Harling Hall in the 1640s, possibly to avoid being destroyed by the Puritans. Second, for protection during World War II. Some elements have been incorporated from windows previously elsewhere in the church: the two angels in the upper centre and the red squirrel in the very top left. The red squirrel is from the arms of the Lovell family and appears in many locations in the church (and in the Holbein painting of Anne Lovell Portrait of a Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling).

As a two-year-old in 2016 she showed top-class form, winning two of her four starts (including the Artemis Stakes) and finished second in the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. In the following year she failed to win but was placed in several major races including the Oka Sho and the Shuka Sho. As a four-year- old she won the Tokyo Shimbun Hai and the Queen Elizabeth II Cup as well as running second in the Victoria Mile and the Hong Kong Vase and was awarded the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare. In 2019 she had her most successful season as she took the Takarazuka Kinen in Japan and the Cox Plate in Australia before ending her track career with a victory in the Arima Kinen. Lys Gracieux is the third highest earning racehorse in the world among the racehorses born in 2014. Background Lys Gracieux is a dark bay or brown mare with a white blaze and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During her racing career she was trained by Yoshito Yahagi and raced in the green, white and red colours of the Northern Farm affiliate U Carrot Farm. She was from the seventh crop of foals sired by Heart's Cry a horse whose wins included the Arima Kinen and the Dubai Sheema Classic. His other foals have included Admire Rakti, Just A Way and Suave Richard. Lys Gracieux's dam, Liliside showed high-class form on the track in France, winning five of her eleven starts including four Listed races. She was descended from the French broodmare Doublure whose other descendants have included Greek Money, Shirley Heights, Pentire and Divine Proportions. Racing career 2016: two-year-old season Lys Gracieux began her racing career by finishing second to the colt Root Directory in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres at Niigata Racecourse on 27 August. Two weeks later at Hanshin Racecourse she recorded her first success when she won a maiden race over an 1800 metres in a record time of 1:46.2. On 29 October she was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Artemis Stakes over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and started the 7/5 against seventeen opponents. Ridden by the veteran Yutaka Take she won by half a length from Flawless Magic. She was then moved up to the highest level for the Grade 1 Hanshin Juvenile Fillies on 11 December. After racing towards the rear of the eighteen-runner field she produced a strong late charge but was unable to reel in the favourite Soul Stirring and finished second, beaten one and a quarter lengths by the winner. In the official Japanese ratings for 2016, Lys Gracieux was rated the second-best two-year-old filly, three pounds behind Soul Stirring. 2017: three-year-old season Lys Gracieux in September 2017 On her first appearance as a three-year-old Lys Gracieux ran third behind Soul Stirring and Miss Panthere in the Tulip Sho over 1600 metres at Hanshin on 4 March. In the Grade 1 Oka Sho over the same course and distance five weeks later she produced a sustained challenge in the straight and finished second, beaten half a length by the 40/1 outsider Reine Minoru with Soul Stirring in third place. When moved up in trip for the Yushun Himba at Tokyo on 21 May she came from well off the pace to come home fifth of the eighteen runners behind Soul Stirring. After a break of almost four months Lys Gracieux returned to the track in September and finished third to Rabbit Run in the Grade 2 Rose Stakes over 1800 metres at Hanshin. In the Grade 1 Shuka Sho a month later the filly produced her customary late charge, caught the leader Mozu Katchan 50 metres from the finish but was overtaken by the fast-finishing Deirdre in the final strides. On her final run of the year Lys Gracieux came home eighth behind Mozu Katchan in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Kyoto Racecourse on 12 November. 2018: four-year-old season Lys Gracieux's trainer Yoshito Yahagi Lys Gracieux began her third campaign in the Grade 3 Tokyo Shimbun Hai over 1600 metres on 4 February in which she started the 4.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Daiwa Cagney and Greater London. Ridden by Take she recorded her first win in sixteen months as she won by a length from the four- year-old colt Satono Ares (Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes). In April she started favourite for the Grade 2 Hanshin Himba Stakes but in a closely contested finish she ran third place, beaten a head and a neck by Miss Panthere and Red Avancer. In the Grade 1 Victoria Mile at Tokyo on 13 May the filly went off the 3.3/1 favourite but despite making rapid progress in the straight she failed by a nose to catch the outsider Jour Polaire. In the Yasuda Kinen over the same course and distance on 3 June she made little impact and came home eighth of the sixteen runners behind Mozu Ascot, beaten five and a half lengths by the winner. On her return from a five-month break Lys Gracieux finished second by a neck to Deirdre in the Fuchu Himba Stakes over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 13 October. Four weeks after her defeat in Tokyo the filly was partnered by Jo√£o Moreira when she made her second attempt to win the Queen Elizabeth II Cup and started the 2.7/1 third choice in the betting behind Mozu Katchan and Normcore (Shion Stakes) while the other fourteen entrants included Cantabile (Rose Stakes), Miss Panthere and Admire Lead (2017 Victoria Mile). Lys Gracieux race in mid-division before switching to the outside in the final turn and produced a sustained run in the straight to run down the front-running Crocosmia and win by a neck. Moreira commented \\"Today was her day. We were in a good position, two off the fence, and she had plenty left in the tank after angling out at the last turn. Under pressure, she responded very well and I had every confidence from the 300 meter point that we were going to win. She's a real champion.\\" Lys Gracieux ended her season with a trip to Hong Kong to contest the Hong Kong Vase over 2400 metres at Sha Tin Racecourse on 9 December. With Moreira in the saddle she raced towards the rear of the field before launching a strong run on the outside in the straight. She gained the advantage in the last 200 metres but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten a neck by the locally trained Exultant. In January 2019 Lys Gracieux was named Best Older Filly or Mare at the JRA Awards for 2018 taking 265 of the 276 votes. 2019: five-year-old season Damian Lane, who rode Lys Gracieux to her three major wins in 2019 On her first run as a five-year-old in the Grade 2 Kinko Sho over 2000 metres at Chukyo Racecourse on 10 March she started at odds of 7.7/1 in a thirteen-runner field and finished second to the four-year-old colt Danon Premium. For her next run the mare was sent to Hong Kong for the second time to contest the Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 2000 metres at Sha Tin. Ridden by Oisin Murphy she was restrained in mid-division before making progress in the straight and came home third behind Win Bright and Exultant, beaten a length by the winner. On her return to Japan she was one of twelve horses to contest the 60th running of the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin on 23 June. She was partnered by Damian Lane and went off the 4.4/1 third choice in the betting behind Kiseki (2017 Kikuka Sho) and Rey de Oro, while the other contenders included Al Ain, Suave Richard and Makahiki. After racing in second place behind the front-running Kiseki, Lys Gracieux challenged the favourite in the straight, gained the advantage 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths. Lane commented \\"She broke well and I thought I might as well use that to my advantage. I was very confident turning in that she had plenty left in the tank and I was worried that there were a lot of good horses chasing and I thought that they would challenge but she was just too strong\\". In the autumn of 2019 Lys Gracieux was sent to Australia to contest the Cox Plate over 2,040 metres at Moonee Valley on 26 October. She was given a special exemption to compete as horses who had raced in Hong Kong were banned from entering Australia unless they had spent at least 180 days in a third country in the interim, after the Australian Government raised concerns over China's biosecurity regulations. With Lane again in the saddle she was made the 6/4 favourite against thirteen opponents including Mystic Journey (Australian Guineas), Castelvecchio (Champagne Stakes (ATC)), Magic Wand (runner-up in the Irish Champion Stakes), Avilius (Tancred Stakes), Danceteria (Bayerisches Zuchtrennen), Verry Elleegant (Australian Oaks), Cape of Good Hope (Caulfield Stakes) and Kings Will Dream (Turnbull Stakes). Lys Gracieux raced towards the rear before beginning to make rapid progress on the outside approaching the final turn. She overhauled the three-year-old Castelvecchio 70 metres from the finish and kept on well to win by one and a half lengths. After the race Yoshito Yahagi said \\"I was confident beforehand as she has thrived since she arrived in Australia and was in even better form than when she was in Japan. I've been wanting to win this race for many years, ever since I saw Kingston Town win in 1982... I thought she was not going to make it, but Damian is a top jockey and Lys Gracieux is a very good horse. We will aim her at the Arima Kinen\\". Lys Gracieux wins the Arima Kinen As Yahagi had suggested, Lys Gracieux ended her season in the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 22 December. Ridden by Lane she went off the 5.7/1 second favourite behind Almond Eye in a sixteen-runner field which also included Saturnalia, World Premiere, Suave Richard, Fierement, Kiseki, Rey de Oro, Cheval Grand and Al Ain. Lane settled the mare on the inside rail towards the rear of the field as Aerolithe set a fast pace, and then switched to the outside in the straight. Lys Gracieux accelerated into the lead just inside the last 200 metres and drew right away from her opponents to win easily by five lengths. Lane said \\"I just had so much confidence in this horse... I just knew she was going to run a big race. It was a really good pace and I found a lovely spot back in the rail... a space opened up and she did the rest\\". In January 2020 Lys Gracieux was awarded the title of Japanese Horse of the Year, receiving 271 of the 274 votes as well as winning the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare for the second time. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Lys Gracieux was given a rating of 126, making her the fifth best racehorse in the world. Lys Gracieux is the third highest earning racehorse in the world among the racehorses born in 2014, after Thunder Snow and Enable.

Its address is Radniƒçn√° 577/1. History The Apponyi Palace was built in 1761‚Äì1762 by Count Gy√∂rgy Apponyi, a member of the ancient Apponyi family and advisor to the King of Hungary, in place of two older townhouses. It was acquired in 1867 from the Apponyis by the Bratislava municipality, which subsequently added its arms on the cartouche above the street doorway. Two of its original four wings were demolished in 1910‚Äì1912 for the construction of a new municipal building. It was comprehensively renovated between 2003 and 2007. Description The ground floor was both residential and used for storage. The first floor is the representative piano nobile with preserved rococo-classical interior decorations. The second floor was used as private quarters by the Apponyi family, with less high ceilings and less elaborate decorations. The attic was used for accommodation from the 18th century until the first half of the 19th century (it was common for visitors to coronations and other major events to sleep in the attics of townhouses and palaces of the noble). Today, the wooden booths for sleeping have been removed. The palace now houses two museums, the Museum of Viticulture in the basement, and the Period Rooms Museum upstairs.

The actress previously appeared in the serial as an extra. When the part of Bella came up, Miller felt a strong connection to the character and storyline. She was cast in June 2018 and Home and Away marks her first major television role. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 November 2018. The character was introduced as the younger half-sister of Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin) and she received several on-screen mentions as part of his early storylines. Bella's fictional backstory establishes that she and her mother were taken away by her father Ross Nixon (Justin Rosniak) when she was young. Bella is portrayed as sheltered, but independent and feisty. Miller found herself being able to live out her rebellious side through her, and she uses her qualifications in psychology and rehabilitation counselling to help her portray Bella's feelings. Miller praised Bella's unglamorous and realistic style as a positive characteristic for young female viewers to see. When Colby and Bella are reunited, Bella protects herself with a crossbow and Franklin described her as \\"completely feral\\". Bella moves to Summer Bay with Colby, but Miller said she is greatly affected by Ross's crimes and lies. The character's early storylines dealt with Ross's return, as he kidnaps her and tries to get revenge on Colby, her fears that she is messing up Colby's life, and her rebellious behaviour, which results in a new living situation. The script writers used the character to highlight the growing issue of online predators targeting and grooming young Australians. Bella's predator, 25-year-old Tommy O'Reilly (Adam Sollis) attempts to sexually assault her when they meet, but is stopped by Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Miller hoped the storyline would lead to more awareness of the issue. Towards the end of 2019, Bella starts feuding with Mackenzie Booth (Emily Weir), after she breaks up with Colby. Miller believed that Bella sees Mackenzie as a threat and wants to get revenge. She is also diagnosed with tetanus, and she uses her illness to manipulate Colby into spending all his time with her. Miller received a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent for her portrayal of Bella. The character's introduction was branded memorable by New Idea's Jackie Brygel, while her polarising behaviour led one critic from Inside Soap to call her \\"trouble with a capital 'T'\\". Miller received positive feedback from parents after the grooming storyline aired. Casting The character received several on-screen mentions following the introduction of her elder brother Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin) in February 2018. Miller's casting as Bella was confirmed in September when she replaced injured co-star Olivia Deeble at the Bundaberg Ability Ball. Miller had appeared in the serial as an extra when she was 15. Years later, she attended three auditions for roles, including that of Ziggy Astoni, which went to Sophie Dillman. When the part of Bella came up, Miller felt \\"a strong connection\\" to the character and her storyline, despite there being very few similarities between them. Miller met Franklin at the audition and he commented, that \\"she was my pick\\" of all the actresses. Miller learned she had been cast in June 2018, and she had to keep the news to herself until her on-screen debut. Miller, who was studying psychology at university at the time, did not put much pressure on herself to secure the part. Home and Away marks Miller's first major television role. Her first scenes aired on 26 November 2018. Development Characterisation Miller described Bella as \\"an independent ‚Äì but sheltered ‚Äì 16-year-old who is still discovering herself and the world around her. Although she is feisty, underneath her hard exterior, she wants to be loved.\\" She called Bella \\"a bit cheeky\\" and someone who \\"will tell it how she sees it\\". Miller also said that Bella wants to fit into the Bay, but as she is not sure how, it leads to her vulnerable side coming out. Miller, who is around six years older than her character, found herself being able to live out her \\"rebellious side\\" through Bella.She admitted that she was nothing like Bella in school and never received a detention, which makes the character fun for her to portray. She commented, \\"I think it's good being older because I know when I can tap into the emotions that I did feel when your hormones are a little bit everywhere. It's good looking back and being able to play it.\\" Miller did not think she and Bella would be close friends in real life, but she could sympathise with her. Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz pointed out that Bella has been popular with girls who watch Home and Away, and Miller believed that it was partly due to Bella's style, which she described as unglamorous and realistic. Miller liked looking \\"a bit rough on screen, in like the hair's never perfect and the clothes are never perfect\\", which she thought was a positive thing for younger female viewers to see. Miller's qualifications in psychology and rehabilitation counselling help her to portray how Bella is feeling during her storylines. She explained to Harvey that she uses her knowledge of PTSD and bi-polar to justify Bella's behaviour and what she says and feels. She also told Jackie Brygel of New Idea: \\"Helping people has always been a part of my life and I think that's one of the reasons I love acting ‚Äì because I get to empathise with a character. I really love playing Bella, because she is ultimately a troubled child due to her upbringing, and I wanted to bring some truth to that.\\" Bella's behaviour is greatly affected by her father, his crimes and death. Her feisty persona helps her avoid getting close to anyone, as she fears they will leave or do something bad. Miller added, \\"Her dad who she thought she loved has killed her mum and then her brother who she began to love has now killed her dad. I think it now sets up for tough issues within Bella.\\" Miller believed that when Bella plans to get revenge on those that have wronged her or Colby, she thinks it is acceptable because she saw her father do it. In November 2019, Miller confirmed that Bella's behaviour will begin to change and improve. She hoped that viewers would like the new side of Bella, as she just gets to be a teenager for a while. Introduction The character's fictional backstory established that she and her mother were taken away by her father Ross Nixon (Justin Rosniak), leaving behind her half- brother Colby, who began searching for them. Scenes airing in November 2018 saw Colby gain an address for Ross, shortly after learning that he killed Colby and Bella's mother. When Colby and his friend Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor) eventually track Bella down, her first instinct is to protect herself with a crossbow. Franklin described Bella as \\"completely feral\\" and said Colby had imagined they would have a much happier reunion. After firing the crossbow, Bella flees and hides out in the backyard. Miller explained her character's reaction: \\"Bella is terrified ‚Äì she's been told repeatedly by her dad that Colby is not to be trusted. Her first instinct is to protect herself, and she won't leave without a fight, or firing an arrow.\\" Jackie Brygel of New Idea observed that Bella is \\"traumatised\\", while Miller said her character views Colby as an enemy thanks to her father. Miller admitted that she was already nervous about filming her first scene before she was handed the crossbow. But she felt the weight of the weapon helped her get into character, saying \\"as an actor, it allowed me to place all my nervous energy into one solid object.\\" A safety officer was present on set, and the potential for something to go wrong helped Miller and Franklin to bond. Knowing that his violent stepfather could return home at any moment, Colby decides to kidnap Bella. Franklin believed his character has no other option but to take Bella against her will. He and Dean take her to an old River Boys gang hideout, where they attempt to undo Ross's brainwashing. Upon hearing about Ross's criminal history, Bella initially denies it, as she questions how her father, who has protected her, could be that bad. Miller told Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis that most of Bella's \\"anger and hints of her dark personality\\" comes from learning this information, as she wonders if her childhood has been a lie. Colby eventually brings Bella back to Summer Bay to live with him. Early storylines Bella's arrival causes tension and a break-up between Colby and his fianc√©e Chelsea Campbell (Ashleigh Brewer), who realises that he lied to her and kidnapped his own sister. Bella goes through \\"a harrowing\\" police interview about her parents, which leaves her feeling responsible for her mother's death. She also feels guilty about Colby and Chelsea's break-up, and encourages the couple to talk. Following Colby and Chelsea's reconciliation, the family take a break off-screen. Upon their return, they announce they are moving to the city after the wedding. Chelsea and Bella then come into conflict over Bella's schooling, as Chelsea wants her level of education assessed. During the show's 2018 season finale, Colby and Chelsea marry, and an armed Ross takes Bella, Chelsea and Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts) hostage. The first episodes of the new season focused on resolving the cliffhanger. Bella tries to reason with her father, but soon learns that Ross wants revenge on Colby for taking her away from him. He plans to lure Colby into a trap and kill him. Colby opts not to call in back up and goes to meet Ross with Dean. He finds Chelsea and Bella tied up, while Dean helps an unconscious Willow. Ross tries to force Colby into choosing between his wife and his sister, but he runs at him and Bella strikes his arm to force him into dropping the gun, which goes off. Miller commented, \\"Ultimately, there are some things you just can't recover from. It's an incredibly intense time.\\" Franklin explained that after Colby witnesses Ross shooting Willow, he believes that Ross will not stop until he has killed everyone Colby loves, so he shoots Ross dead. Colby initially keeps Ross's death a secret from Bella, but when he learns that she is worried that her father will return, he decides to tell her the truth. He admits that he was trying to protect her, but \\"a terrified\\" Bella struggles to understand what he is saying, before he admits that Ross is dead. The character's early storylines also dealt with her fears that she is \\"messing up\\" Colby's life, after she overhears him telling his Sergeant that he is unable to return to work, as he is too busy caring for her. Bella runs away and her disappearance leads Colby, Dean and Willow to come together to find her. Bella also worries that she is going to lose the \\"family\\" she has in Willow and Dean, when the latter grows closer to Ziggy Astoni (Sophie Dillman). She stows away in the boot of their car as they head to a rally, with the aim of revealing herself once they are far enough away. Bella hopes the pair will return her to the Bay, so she can reunite Dean with Willow, but Dean calls Colby to collect her instead. The scenes were filmed on-location in Flinders Ranges. Colby struggles with Bella's rebellious behaviour, and after she lashes out and hurts him during an argument with Dean, he accepts an offer from Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) to take her in. An Inside Soap writer wondered whether Irene would be able to get through to Bella, and commented \\"has she bitten off more than she can chew this time?\\" When Irene plans a trip overseas, Colby asks Bella to move back in with him for a while. Bella is initially keen, until she spots her brother flirting with newcomer Mackenzie Booth (Emily Weir). She changes her mind and questions his priorities. Online grooming and assault In mid-2019, the show's script writers took inspiration from Carly's Law and used the character to highlight the growing issue of online predators targeting and grooming young Australians. The storyline was scripted to run for three months and filming began in February. Bella is introduced to an online student forum by her teacher Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) and she soon befriends fellow user Tommy (Adam Sollis). She confides in him about her family and living situation, having recently moved in with Irene Roberts. As they continue communicating, Tommy asks Bella for photos and further personal details. Bella initially believes Tommy is a fellow high school student, but later learns that he is a 25-year-old teacher. Miller was keen to do the storyline in the hope that it would provoke conversation and awareness, stating \\"I really wanted to do this story because I think it's very powerful and can connect with a lot of people. At first I was thinking (Tommy) would be a bit older, that he would be an older man, but really it connects more so that he is young.\\" Wanting to add realism to the storyline, Miller watched documentaries about the victims of online predators, so she could learn how they talk about their experiences. The show's producers also talked with the eSafety Commissioner to make sure the plot was realistic. Series producer Lucy Addario confirmed that Bella was chosen for the storyline because \\"she had no previous exposure to social media conventions.\\" Bella's rescue from an online predator by Irene Roberts (actress Lynne McGranger pictured) has big consequences for them both. Tommy visits Bella at home, and Miller said that Bella is shocked to see him on her doorstep and she quickly realises that she could be in trouble. Tommy makes attempts to reassure Bella and claims that he just wanted to meet her in person. Tommy's jealousy over Bella's friendship with Ryder Jackson (Lukas Radovich) prompts her to panic and she eventually locks herself in the bathroom, hoping that Tommy will leave. However, when she emerges Tommy grabs her and drags her into a nearby bedroom, where he attempts to sexually assault her. Miller admitted that she found the scenes difficult to film, and she became scared as she imagined it being a real-life situation. The actress praised Sollis for helping her out, and she told Williams: \\"The more more we (rehearsed), the more comfortable it became and the more truth I felt I could give to it.\\" Irene is brought into the storyline when she returns home to find Tommy attacking Bella. McGranger told Alice Penwill of Inside Soap that until that moment, Irene has not suspected anything is up, even when Bella makes an excuse not to attend a wedding with her. Irene sees Tommy on top of Bella and instinctively picks up a nearby vase and strikes him. Tommy pleads with the pair not to call the police, but this causes Irene to recall the abuse she suffered in her childhood. McGranger expanded on this: \\"So when Tommy says to Bella, 'Don't call the police, this will just be our little secret', that triggers something in Irene about her past. She picks up the nearest thing and basically bludgeons him with it!\\" McGranger praised the show's editors for their work on making the scenes suitable for the early evening timeslot, but leaving the audience with no doubt as to what has happened. McGranger hoped that viewers would be able to sympathise with her character's actions, as they are aware of Irene's past. Speaking to Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, McGranger explained that Bella takes charge and stops Irene from calling an ambulance. McGranger quipped, \\"because of Bella's past with Colby and her father, she's 16 going on 40! But Irene reverts to that terrified teenager.\\" She also called it \\"a 16-year-old's wishful thinking\\" when Bella believes that they can forget what happened after leaving Tommy at the hospital. As the storyline progresses, the police discover Tommy's identity and Irene's guilt forces her to go to the police and confess, despite Bella's protests. As Colby learns the truth, Tamara Cullen of TV Week observed that he is \\"rattled by his sister's words and sad he couldn't be there to stop the attack.\\" Bella is seen struggling after she agrees to testify in court for Irene. She attends a party thrown by Ryder and uses alcohol as a distraction. Bella faces Tommy in court during Irene's hearing and, as she gives details about her assault, an enraged Colby tries to attack him. Irene is found guilty, but she is not given a custodial sentence. Tommy is later murdered by activist Teresa Masterson (Simone McAullay). Bella is shown to be traumatised by the events. She moves back in with Colby, but hides in her room and has to be coaxed out by Willow. An encounter with Dean frightens Bella and later leads to a nightmare about Tommy. In an interview with the Metro's Imogen Groome, Miller confirmed that Bella's life would be affected by Tommy's actions. She told Groome that Bella has \\"great difficulty\\" going back to school, as she fears everyone knows what has happened, and she finds it hard to concentrate on her work. Miller commented, \\"Bella just wants to be close to Colby and therefore school has become insignificant to her.\\" Bella also becomes even more distrustful of men, something that began with her father. Miller stated \\"Bella has a disfigured understanding of men. She grew up with a forceful dad who she later found out was the murderer of her own mother. Although she has Colby and Dean in her life, Bella has learnt to distrust and protect herself against men. The situation with Tommy has caused Bella to distrust men even more.\\" This leads to Bella clashing with Colby's housemate Robbo (Jake Ryan), as he confronts her about her behaviour and how it is affecting Colby. Feud with Mackenzie, tetanus and overdose Bella begins feuding with Mackenzie after she breaks up with Colby because of his occupation, leaving him \\"heartbroken\\". Bella is \\"livid\\" with Mackenzie and attempts to confront her, but she is stopped by Dean and Willow, who are concerned about her recent violent outbursts. After listening to a drunken Colby talking about his heartbreak, Bella takes a can of gasoline to Mackenzie's restaurant, Salt, and plans to set the place on fire, but Dean and Willow catch her in time. Bella is \\"staunchly unrepentant\\" as she explains that she wants to hurt Mackenzie for breaking up with Colby. Speaking to a New Idea writer, Miller believed that Bella intention to burn down Salt came from \\"a place of vulnerability\\". She feels that Mackenzie has broken her trust and hurt her brother, like Chelsea did before she left the Bay. Miller continued, \\"Bella sees Mackenzie as a threat and will go to any extreme to get revenge.\\" Bella later catches the couple kissing when she follows Colby, and she is \\"anything but happy\\". Colby makes the situation worse when he lies to her about where he went. The storyline leads to Bella's hospitalisation, after she falls ill and Mackenzie does not take her seriously. With Bella due to go on a school trip, Colby and Mackenzie make plans to spend the weekend together. However, when Bella claims that she is sick and not well enough to go anywhere, Colby has no choice but to cancel the plans, leading Mackenzie to accuse Bella of faking her illness. As Bella storms out of the flat, followed by Mackenzie and Colby, she collapses. After being rushed to the hospital, Doctor Alex Neilson (Zoe Ventoura) learns that Bella has not been immunised and diagnoses her with tetanus. Bella later uses her illness to manipulate Colby into spending all his time with her, but when he learns that she has been lying to him, Bella is \\"terrified\\" that she is going to lose him and takes an overdose of medication stolen from the hospital. Miller commented that \\"Bella doesn't think of the consequences.\\" The 2019 season finale sees Bella and Mackenzie among several characters caught up in a siege at the hospital. Mackenzie risks her own life to try and get help for Bella when she learns what she has done, but the gunman refuse her medical help and Bella's condition deteriorates rapidly. Miller added that Bella is \\"terrified ‚Äì and keeps asking if she's going to die.\\" Reception For her portrayal of Bella, Miller received a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent in 2019. Jackie Brygel of New Idea thought Miller made \\"a memorable first impression\\" as a crossbow wielding Bella. Tamara Cullen of TV Week branded the character \\"rebellious\\". Simon Timblick of What's on TV called her a \\"troubled teenager\\", while a New Idea writer dubbed her \\"deeply troubled\\". An Inside Soap columnist believed Bella was the \\"toughest\\" of the \\"troubled young girls\\" that Irene has cared for over the years, and wrote \\"from assaulting her brother to lashing out at her friends, Bella is trouble with a capital 'T' ‚Äì and she's now revealing her personal details to someone online, with devastating consequences.\\" Miller revealed that she had been approached by a number of parents thanking her for the grooming storyline, which led to their own children talking to them about it. Kerry Harvey of Stuff.co.nz noted that Miller's performance as Bella and the character's \\"out- of-control behaviour\\" had \\"polarised viewers\\". A New Idea writer observed that Bella has had \\"a hugely traumatic year\\" and \\"has been causing no end of strife\\" for Colby and Mackenzie. TV Week named Bella's kidnap by Ross and her assault as two of their \\"biggest twists and jaw-dropping moments\\" of 2019.

Films in this style traditionally incorporate the religious aspects of Hanukkah, such as lighting the menorah and the story of the Macabees, as well as the cultural aspects of Hanukkah, such as spinning dreidels, or eating traditional foods such as latkes, sufganiyot, or gelt. Films in this genre are typically similar to comedy and romantic comedy films in content, however some are similar in style to action, drama, and animated films, among other genres. Hanukkah films are more commonly produced in the United States, however, they are also produced in other countries such as Israel. Hanukkah films have been compared to Christmas films, as the two holidays are celebrated during a similar time of year, and sometimes have similar storylines. The relative dearth of Hanukkah films, related to the thousands of Christmas films that have been produced, has been criticized, especially by those in the Jewish community, some of whom have asked for more films in this genre to be produced. History 1986‚Äì2002 Hanukkah has historically been more commonly portrayed in television, than in film, due to the relative lower financial risk and cost of production as compared to a feature film. One of the first films in this genre, was the 1986 American animated musical comedy-drama adventure film, ‚ÄùAn American Tail\\", which was directed by Don Bluth and went on to become the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film of its time. Though the film is not exclusively about Hanukkah, the holiday features prominently in its plot; as the opening scene of the film centers around the holiday. 2002‚Äì2018 In 2002, the animated Hanukkah film, \\"Eight Crazy Nights\\" was released. The film was written and started by Adam Sandler, who also based the title of the film off the lyrics of his song, \\"The Chanukah Song\\". The film featured other notable actors such as Rob Schneider, Kevin Nealon, Jon Lovitz, and Jackie Titone (who is also Sandler's wife), and has been called the best known and highest profile Hanukkah film, and has been credited with starting the genre. The film was a box office bomb, grossing only $23.8 million of its $34 million budget; but gained a cult following among those in the Jewish community in the years following its release. The film has remained popular, however, some critics find the film abrasive and express the desire for \\"a better Hanukkah movie\\" to be made. In 2012, the Hallmark Channel produced its first film mentioning Hanukkah, \\"Hitched for the Holidays\\", starring Joey Lawrence as an actor hired by a Jewish woman played by Emily Hampshire, (Hampshire is not actually Jewish herself), to pretend to be her boyfriend around her character's family, as they visit the \\"couple\\" for Hanukkah. Lawrence and Hampshire's characters later fall in love and marry in the end of the film. 2018‚Äìpresent In November 2018, Hallmark Channel announces their intention to produce two Hanukkah films titled, \\"Holiday Date\\", and \\"Double Holiday\\", respectively, on their television channel, which would air during their annual Countdown to Christmas event the following year. This was the first time the channel produced a Hanukkah film, and a spokeswoman for the channel said that the one film, \\"Holiday Date\\", would have, ‚ÄúHannukah elements‚Ä¶ which is a lot of fun as Hanukkah and Christmas overlap in 2019.‚Äù The other film's script, \\"Holiday Date\\", was not finished at the time. Notable examples of Hanukkah films Some notable examples of films in this genre, as well as films featuring Hanukkah, are listed as follows. An American Tail An American Tail is a 1986 American animated musical comedy- drama adventure film directed by Don Bluth and produced by Sullivan Bluth Inc. and Amblin Entertainment. The film opens as the family is celebrating Hanukkah in Shostka, Ukraine in 1885, the Mousekewitzes, a Russian-Jewish family of mice who live with a human family named Moskowitz, are celebrating the holiday and Papa gives his hat to his 5-year-old son, Fievel, and tells him about the United States, a country where there are no cats. The celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the village square in an anti-Jewish arson attack and their cats likewise attack the village mice. Because of this, the Moskowitz home, along with that of the Mousekewitzes, is destroyed, and the film tells the story of Fievel Mousekewitz and his family as they emigrate from the Imperial Russian territory of Ukraine to the United States for freedom. However, he gets lost and must find a way to reunite with them. Eight Crazy Nights Eight Crazy Nights is a 2002 American adult animated musical comedy-drama Hanukkah film directed by Seth Kearsley and produced, co-written by and starring Adam Sandler, in his first voice-acting role. The film is animated in the style of television holiday specials, and, unlike most mainstream holiday films, centers on Jewish characters during the Hanukkah season, as opposed to the Christian celebration of Christmas. This is also Happy Madison Productions' first animated film. The film's title is taken from a line in Sandler's series of songs called The Chanukah Song that compares the gift-giving traditions of Christmas and Chanukah: \\"Instead of one day of presents, we get eight crazy nights!\\". Additionally, a new version of The Chanukah Song was played over the film's closing credits. It has been called the best known Hanukkah film. The film has received a cult following, especially among those in the Jewish community, as it is one of the highest profile and most known Hanukkah films. The Hebrew Hammer The Hebrew Hammer is a 2003 American comedy Hanukkah film written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars Adam Goldberg, Judy Greer, Andy Dick, Mario Van Peebles, and Peter Coyote. The plot concerns a Jewish blaxploitation crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save Hanukkah from the evil son of Santa Claus, who wants to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and make everyone celebrate Christmas. Full-Court Miracle Full-Court Miracle is a 2003 Disney Channel Original Hanukkah Movie. It premiered on November 21, 2003. Inspired by the true story of University of Virginia Cavaliers basketball star Lamont Carr, the film centers on a group of young Jewish basketball players during the Hanukkah season who are determined to find their own Judah Macabee to coach their team and help their team out of a slump. The main character Alex Schlotsky is inspired by the true story of Chad Korpeck and Alex Barbag. The film makes numerous references to the miracle of the oil, with the school's electricity staying on even though it was being powered by a gas generator with only enough fuel for one hour instead of the eight hours the game lasted. The film concludes with Rabbi Lewis (a fictional character in the film) telling the story of Hanukkah and its relation to the basketball game plays over the scene. Notable examples of films referencing Hanukkah Futurama: Bender's Big Score Futurama: Bender's Big Score (or Bender's Big Score) is a 2007 American direct-to-video animated science fiction comedy- adventure film based on the animated series Futurama. The film incorporates other holidays, but features an original character named the ‚ÄúChanukah Zombie‚Äù played by Mark Hamill (known for his role as Luke Skywalker).

Originally she wanted to become a concert singer, but when she heard the then court theatre director at a concert of the commercial association in G√∂ppingen, he invited her to an audition. Thereupon she was engaged for three years at the Hoftheater Stuttgart. She liked it there, but because she felt that her voice needed further training, she took a three-month vacation in the first year and went to Paris to study with Pauline Viardot-Garcia. As she made good progress, she also went to Paris for a second and third year. In 1891 she made a guest appearance at the Hofoperntheater in Vienna as \\"Rosine\\", \\"Philine\\" and \\"Susanne\\" with such success that she was offered an engagement. But she decided for the Hofoperntheater Berlin, which had given her a contract at the same time. She stayed there until 1912 (stage farewell August 1912 as \\"Marie\\" in Der Waffenschmied by A. Lortzing). After that she worked as a concert singer and singing teacher. She was an excellent coloratura singer, whose technical skill was especially praised, as well as the sparkling light fluid of her passages and fioritura. The voice, a modulation-capable soprano of considerable size, was characterized by an incredibly sympathetically touching timbre and a fresh, melodious sound. Her humorous roles were particularly good. Marie Dietrich died in 1939 in Berlin at age 71. Her unpreserved grave was on one of the .

Milwaukee Avenue in Libertyville, Illinois. The commercial block was built in 1928 for utility magnate Samuel Insull. Architect Hermann V. von Holst designed the building, which has an eclectic style mainly influenced by the Gothic Tudor Revival and Plateresque styles. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Samuel Insull, a former associate of Thomas Edison who developed and controlled much of the Midwestern utilities market, commissioned the building in 1928. Insull had lived in Libertyville since 1907, and he owned the Libertyville Trust and Savings Bank along with many other banks throughout the Midwest. The two-story building included commercial space on its first floor and offices and apartments on its second. In addition to renting the space within it, Insull also intended for the building to highlight the power of electricity and, in turn, the importance of his work to expand it. The building's initial tenants included Insull's own bank, a Chevrolet dealership, clothing stores, and dentists and small companies in the office space. Shortly after the building opened, the Great Depression bankrupted Insull, and he lost both his assets and his influence. Without an involved owner, the building fell into disrepair in the ensuing decades. A new owner renovated the building in the 1950s, resulting in both the bank's return to the building and new shops opening there. Another renovation took place in 1982, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 8, 1983. Architecture Chicagoan Hermann V. von Holst designed the Public Service Building. von Holst was known both for his work as an academic architect and for purchasing Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago practice in 1909 when Wright moved to Europe. He had designed buildings for Insull and his utility companies for decades, but due to Insull's ensuing bankruptcy, the Public Service Building proved to be the last they would collaborate on. von Holst's design for the building incorporates several architectural styles. The Gothic Tudor Revival style is most prominent throughout the building, but it also includes elements of Spanish and Indian architecture. As the building occupies a corner lot, it has two fronts, which are joined by a corner tower with a cupola. The stone facade of the bank's original space has a Plateresque design, a Spanish style which von Holst used to convey sturdiness. While the building initially included a central arcade, it was enclosed during its renovations; the arcade's west entrance, however, still stands, and it features a dome and a Seth Thomas clock.

Despite the fact that Bal√≥ was dismissed under pressure of the German ambassador who was accusing him of transfersing Polish soldiers to Western Europe, Utassy continued his policy to secure Polish soldiers. In March 1944, when the Germans began occupation of Hungary, he denied the Gestapo access to the internment camps and refused to surrender Polish soldiers. He also aimed to establish the Red Cross as the representation of Poles in Hungary. On 16 October 1944, Utassy was arrested by the Hungarian fascists, and deported to Bavaria. After the end of the war, in 1945 he returned to Hungary and was nominated to general. Though, he retired following year. In 1951, the Communist regime designated him as ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù ‚Äî he was demoted and had part of his family property confiscated and sent for two years to the labour camp in Hortob√°gy. Utassy died in 1974, aged 77. Buried at the Farkasr√©ti Cemetery. In 1990 he was rehabilitated and promoted to the rank of general. On 19 June 2019, Utassy was awarded with Virtus et Fraternitas Medal which from president of Poland Andrzej Duda on his behalf received his grandson.

The course of this river goes through the village of Baie-des- Rochers before going to the Bay of Rochers, in the St. Lawrence River. This small valley is served by the \\"rue des Tours\\" and \\"rue de la Chapelle\\"; these two roads connect together at route 138 which goes along the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River and passes over the Baie des Rochers River at the village of Baie des Rochers. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities (including resort and tourist activities), second. The surface of this stream is generally frozen from mid- December to late-March. Nevertheless, safe ice traffic is generally from late December to mid-March.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the \\"Baie des Rochers river\\" are: * North side: Saguenay River; * East side: Baie des Rochers, St. Lawrence River; * South side: Port aux Quilles River, Noire River, Port au Persil River, Port au Saumon River; * West side: Petit Saguenay River. The Baie des Rochers River rises at the mouth of Baie aux Rochers Lake (altitude: ) in the forest zone. At the edge of this lake, the resort is established around the southeast bay, because of the secondary road that serves this area. From the mouth of Port aux Quilles Lake, the course of the Port aux Quilles River descends by traveling according to the following segments: * to the north including crossing Long Lake (length: ; altitude: ) over its full length, up to at its mouth; * eastward, in particular, crossing the √âcluse Lake (length: ; altitude: ) and the Lake Carp, to the mouth of the latter. Note: the √âcluse lake collects the waters of the Petit Lac Emmuraill√© and the Petit Lac √† Bec Croche from the north; * easterly passing under high- voltage wires from Hydro-Qu√©bec and collecting the outlet of the lake at Pitre, to the bridge of route 138 to the village of Baie-des-Rochers; * to the east by catching the landfill (coming from the north of Gervais lake) and crossing an area of rapids and waterfalls at the end of the route, to the bottom of Baie des Rochers which is open on the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Toponymy This toponym refers to the rocks all around the bay and on \\"Baie des Rochers Island\\" which is located in the middle of the bay. The toponym \\"Rivi√®re de la Baie des Rochers\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Bank of place names of the Commission de toponymie du Quebec Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Bank of place names - Rivi√®re de la Baie des Rochers, accessed December 7, 2019.

History  By 2006, the Office of the Prosecutor received twelve communications concerning the situation in Venezuela, most of them related to crimes allegedly committed by the Venezuelan government and associated forces and one to crimes alleged to have been committed by opposition groups, but the examination was closed on 9 February 2006 because it was concluded that the Rome Statute requirements to seek authorization to initiate an investigation in the country had not been satisfied. In February 2018, the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced that it would open preliminary probes into alleged crimes against humanity performed by Venezuelan authorities. On 27 September 2018, six states parties to the Rome Statute: Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru, referred the situation in Venezuela since 12 February 2014 to the ICC, requesting the Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to initiate an investigation on crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the territory. On 28 September, the Presidency assigned the situation to Pre- Trial Chamber I. This was the first time that member States had sought an investigation of potential crimes that took place entirely on the territory of another country. Nicol√°s Maduro's Foreign Minister, Jorge Arreaza, filed a complaint in the ICC against the United States on 13 February 2020, arguing that policy of sanctions has resulted in crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Bensouda stated that she informed the ICC Presidency of the referral pursuant to the regulations of the court to enable the assignment of the situation to a Pre-Trial Chamber, noting that the two referrals \\"appear to overlap geographically and temporally and may therefore warrant assignment to the same Pre-Trial Chamber\\", but \\"that this should not prejudice a later determination on whether the referred scope of the two situations is sufficiently linked to constitute a single situation\\".

Career  Tagle Lara began writing songs around 1920. In 1923 musicians Carlos Gardel and Jos√© Razzano recorded \\"Cocoroc√≥\\", composed by Tagle Lara and Enrique Delfino. The following year, the zamba \\"El boyero\\" (later renamed \\"Por el camino\\"), which he composed in 1922 with music by pianist Carlos Vicente Geroni Flores, premiered in Montevideo's Concurso de Canciones Regionales (\\"Regional Song Contest\\"), performed by √çtalo Goyeche and N√©stor Feria. The song would later make its way to Spain, where it was popularized by the singers Agust√≠n Irusta, Roberto Fugazot, and Lucio Demare, earning praise from the prominent Sevillian musician Joaqu√≠n Turina. Tagle Lara composed a number of songs with fellow musician Geroni Flores, many of which were performed by the Argentine singer Ignacio Corsini, including \\"Acordes\\", \\"Como lloran los zorzales\\", \\"¬°Huella... Huella!\\", \\"Piller√≠a\\", \\"Siempre amigos\\" and \\"La tropilla\\". Corsini also recorded Tagle Lara's tangos, \\"Guitarra gaucha\\" and \\"Zaraza\\", as well as the song \\"¬øCu√°ndo?\\" in collaboration with his brother Alfonso Corsini. Tagle Lara's songs were also performed by Azucena Maizani (\\"Pancho, comprate un rancho\\"), and Rosita Quiroga, who in 1927 performed his \\"Puente Alsina\\". The duo Magaldi and Noda helped further popularize Tagle Lara's music by featuring it on their 1926 record \\"Trapo Viejo\\", which both saw wide radio broadcast and was performed live at Pascual Contursi's \\"Maldito cabaret\\" (\\"Cursed cabaret\\") in Buenos Aires' Teatro Smart (today the Multiteatro theatre complex). His tango \\"Una tarde\\" (1928), with music by composers Agesilao Ferrazzano and Julio Pollero, was recorded both by the composers' sextet and by Carlos Gardel, arguably the most prominent figure in the history of tango. \\"Zaraza\\", which Tagle Lara composed alone, was awarded the second prize of the Gran Concurso Uruguayo de Tangos del Disco Nacional (\\"Uruguayan Grand Tango Contest\\") of 1929, performed by Francisco Canaro's orchestra at the Cine Teatro Cervantes in Montevideo. The song was later recorded by such singers as Ignacio Corsini, the Romanian singer Christian Vasile, and the Argentine actress and singer Sof√≠a Boz√°n, who performed the song in Paris in 1930. Benjam√≠n Alfonso Tagle Lara collaborated with such composers as Francisco Prac√°nico, Roberto Firpo, Antonio Rodio, Rafael Tuegols, and Eduardo Pereyra during his lifetime. Tagle Lara died in Buenos Aires, Argentina on November 9, 1932, at the age of 40.  References  * del Greco, Orlando. \\"Benjam√≠n Tagle Lara.\\" Todo Tango.

Myanmar), commonly referred to as the Rohingya genocide case, is a case currently being heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).  Background  The Rohingya people are a Muslim Indo-Aryan ethnic minority in Buddhist majority Myanmar who, in recent years, have faced mass persecution and ethnic cleansing that has been described as a genocide. The state government deems them illegal immigrants, but the Rohingya people argue that they have lived in the area for generations and that this treatment is unfair to the Muslims. According to The Economist, regarding Aung San Suu Kyi's motivation for taking up the defendants' cause, \\"It is hard to escape the conclusion that she is exploiting the Rohingyas' misery to boost her party's prospects in elections due in 2020.\\" Aung San Suu Kyi describes this conflict as \\"internal armed conflict\\" that were triggered by Rohingya attacks on the government of Myanmar. The judge presiding the case, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, has given Myanmar four months to implement his rulings: Myanmar must take \\"all measure within its power\\" to prevent genocide.  Procedural history  On 11 November 2019, The Gambia lodged a 45-page application with the ICJ against Myanmar, initiating the case. The application alleged that Myanmar has committed mass murder, rape and destruction of communities against the Rohingya group in Rakhine state since about October 2016 and that these actions violate the Genocide Convention. Outside counsel for The Gambia includes a team from the law firm Foley Hoag led by Paul Reichler, as well as Professors Philippe Sands of University College London and Payam Akhavan of McGill University. On the other side, leader and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi is representing Myanmar, along with a legal team. The Gambia also submitted a request for the indication of provisional measures of protection. The ICJ held a public hearing on that request for three days, 10-12 December 2019. A commentator described the hearing as a \\"remarkable spectacle,\\" noting that The Gambia's team provided \\"brutal descriptions\\" of atrocities, while Aung San Suu Kyi avoided using the word ‚ÄúRohingya‚Äù‚Äîexcept in a reference to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. On 23 January 2020, the ICJ issued an order on The Gambia's request for provisional measures. The order \\"indicated\\" (i.e., issued) provisional measures ordering Myanmar to prevent genocidal acts against the Rohingya Muslims during the pendency of the case, and to report regularly on its implementation of the order. The Court issued a procedural order on the same date, setting filing deadlines of 23 July 2020 for The Gambia's Memorial, and 25 January 2021 for Myanmar's responsive Counter-Memorial. On 18 May 2020, The Court issued an extension for The Gambia's memorial and set a filing deadline of 23 October 2020. Similarly, an extension was granted to Myanmar set at 23 July 2021. Analyses Analyzing the decision in the blog of the European Journal of International Law, Dr. Marko Milanovic, a professor at the University of Nottingham School of Law, called the Court's order \\"obviously a win for The Gambia, and for the Rohingya cause more generally,\\" but also noted that the order largely only replicated existing \\"state obligations under the Genocide Convention,\\" and did not include the broader measures and statements that The Gambia had requested.

History   World War I  The battalion was raised on 10 February 1915 with reservists of the Alpini Battalion \\"Tolmezzo\\" of the 8th Alpini Regiment. The battalion's name, like the names of all Alpini battalions raised during World War I with first line reservists, was the name of a valley near the active battalion's base; in the Val Tagliamento battalion's case the Tagliamento valley, which extends to the north from Tolmezzo. As with all Alpini battalions the recruits for the battalions were drafted exclusively from the area surrounding the battalions base. Initially the battalion fielded the 212th and 272nd Alpini companies, and received the 278th Alpini Company on 1 November 1916. The Val Tagliamento battalion's history is intertwined with the history of the 8th Alpini Regiment, with which it served during World War I. After having suffered heavy losses during the Battle of Caporetto and the following retreat to the Piave the battalion was disbanded on 15 February 1918. For its conduct during the war the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour.  World War II  The battalion was reformed in August 1939 and assigned to the 3rd Alpine Division \\"Julia\\" 19 November 1940 for service in the Greco-Italian War. The battalion suffered heavily during the fighting in the Pindus mountains and lost its commanding officer on 8 January 1941 to enemy fire. After the German invasion of Greece and the Greek surrender the battalion was sent to Yugoslavia on anti-partisan duties. For its conduct during the Greco-Italian war the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour. In July 1943 the battalion returned to its depot in Tolmezzo, where the battalion was renamed Alpini Battalion \\"Tolmezzo\\", as the original Tolmezzo battalion had been destroyed in Ukraine during the Italian Army in Russia's retreat in January 1943.  Cold War  Alpine wall bunker in Mals On 1 July 1963 the XV Alpini Fortification Battalion in Stazione Carnia was renamed Alpini Battalion \\"Val Tagliamento\\". The battalion was part of the 11th Alpini Fortification Grouping of the Alpine Brigade \\"Julia\\" and tasked with tasked to man fortifications in the upper Canale valley, which the Italian Army (correctly) assumed to be one of two main directions of a possible Warsaw Pact advance. Initially the Val Tagliamento fielded six companies, but 30 June 1964 a further three companies arrived from the disbanded Alpini Battalion \\"Val Natisone\\". During the 1975 army reform the 11th Alpini Fortification Grouping was disbanded on 1 June 1975, as was the Val Tagliamento's sister battalion \\"Val Fella\\", whose six companies were transferred to the Val Tagliamento. After the reform the Val Tagliamento received the war flag and traditions of the 11th Alpini Fortification Grouping, moved its headquarters to Tolmezzo, and fielded 16 Alpini companies for an organic strength of over 2,500 men, making it by far the largest battalion in the Italian Army. Below all companies of the battalion are listed with the Nappina color denoting to which battalion a company was originally assigned: 15px = Val Tagliamento 15px = Val Fella 15px = Val Natisone * 30px Alpini Battalion \\"Val Tagliamento\\", in Tolmezzo ** 15px Command and Services Company, in Tolmezzo ** 15px 212th Alpini Company (Type A*, Pl√∂cken Pass fortifications) ** 15px 216th Alpini Company (Type B*, Campiolo fortifications) ** 15px 220th Alpini Company (Type C*, Portis fortifications) ** 15px 269th Alpini Company (Type B, Ugovizza fortifications) ** 15px 270th Alpini Company (Type C, Malborghetto fortifications) ** 15px 271st Alpini Company (Type C, Val d'Uque fortifications) ** 15px 272nd Alpini Company (Type C, Torre Moscarda fortifications) ** 15px 273rd Alpini Company (Type C, Tratte fortifications) ** 15px 278th Alpini Company (Type C, Stua di Ramaz fortifications) ** 15px 288th Alpini Company (Type C, Cavazzo fortifications) ** 15px 306th Alpini Company (Type C, Sella Sompdogna fortifications) ** 15px 307th Alpini Company (Type C, Sella Nevea fortifications) ** 15px 308th Alpini Company (Type B, Sella Carnizza fortifications) ** 15px 312th Alpini Company (Type C, Case Marco fortifications) ** 15px 313th Alpini Company (Type C, Cereschiatis fortifications) ** 15px 314th Alpini Company (Type C, Ponte del Cristo fortifications) * Type A = fortification fully equipped, provisioned and manned; close support platoon on site * Type B = fortification fully equipped, provisioned and manned; close support platoon off site * Type C = fortification fully equipped; provisions, crew and close support platoon off site For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. The fortifications the Val Tagliamento would man in case of war with the Warsaw Pact had been built as Alpine Wall in the early stages of World War II and as fixed fortifications became obsolete the battalion was steadily reduced in the second half of the 1980s consisted of the following companies: * 30px Alpini Battalion \\"Val Tagliamento\\", in Tolmezzo ** 15px Command and Services Company, in Tolmezzo ** 15px 212th Alpini Company, in Paluzza ** 15px 216th Fortifications Maintenance and Surveillance Company, in Tolmezzo ** 15px 269th Alpini Company Ugovizza ** 15px 308th Fortifications Maintenance and Surveillance Company, in Pontebba On 26 September 1992 the battalion was disbanded its war flag was transferred to the shrine of the flags at the Vittoriano in Rome.  War flag and coat of arms  Three of the medals affixed to the Val Tagliamento's war flag and displayed on the battalion's coat of arms had actually been awarded to the Val Natisone battalion (one Silver Medal of Military Valour for the battalions conduct during the Greco- Italian war and one Bronze Medal of Military Valour for the battalion's conduct during the Battle of Asiago), respectively the Val Fella battalion (one Silver Medal of Military Valour for the battalions conduct during the Greco-Italian war), but when the two battalions were merged into the Val Tagliamento their decorations and traditions were added to the Val Tagliamento's.

The course of this river flows into the St. Lawrence River in the village of Port-aux-Quilles, northeast of the town of La Malbaie. This small valley is served by the path of the \\"Lac du Port aux Quilles\\". The lower portion of this valley is served by route 138 along the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational and tourism activities (including resort and tourist activities), second. The surface of this stream is usually frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Nevertheless, safe ice circulation is generally from late December to mid-March.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the \\"Port aux Quilles River\\" are: * North side: Rivi√®re de la Baie des Rochers, Saguenay River; * East side: Anse √† Poitras, St. Lawrence River; * South side: Noire River, Port au Persil River, Port au Saumon River, Rivi√®re √† la Loutre (La Malbaie), Malbaie River; * West side: Noire River. The Port aux Quilles River rises at the mouth of Port aux Quilles Lake (altitude: ) in the forest zone, at the foot of the Montagne de la Croix. On the outskirts of this lake, the resort is established around the eastern bay, near the mouth, because of the path of Port aux Quilles Lake which serves this area. From the mouth of Port aux Quilles Lake, the course of the Port aux Quilles River descends by traveling according to the following segments: * southeasterly, crossing the Mare Lake to the outlet (coming from the north) of the Trout Lake; * easterly collecting the dump (coming from the north) of Lakes Henri, Rouge et Bleu, to a bend in the river corresponding to the dump (coming from the north) of the Falaise lakes and Mosquito; * south-easterly to the outlet (coming from the south) of Lac √âpiphane, then east, forming several small streamers to the outlet of Lac Ceci (coming from South); * northerly, forming a hook to the west, to the outlet of Lake Arthur-Savard (coming from the east); * to the east, forming two successive curves towards the south, notably passing under Hydro-Qu√©bec's high-voltage lines, winding up to the confluence of a stream draining Lake Ennis (coming from the north). Note: This confluence is located just southwest of the center of the hamlet Port-aux-Quilles; * southeasterly by cutting route 138 and collecting the Harvey Lake (from the southwest) discharge to the dump (coming from the northeast) of Seeds Lake; * to the southeast crossing a series of rapids and waterfalls between two mountains, and collecting a stream (from the southwest) to the bottom of the \\"Anse de Port aux Quilles\\", which is open on the Gulf of St. Lawrence.Atlas of Canada - Port aux Quilles River, accessed December 7, 2019 Toponymy The origin of the term \\"Port aux Quilles\\" remains unknown.

Some noteworthy characteristics of this species are the tiny size of its leaves and flowers and that both are also fleshy. Like many other species belonging to the family Thymelaeaceae, it is a toxic plant with medicinal properties that also yields a strong fibre used in the making of rope and paper.Kew Plants of the World Online http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:832995-1 Retrieved at 8.47 on Monday 4/5/20. Etymology Branches of Thymelaea hirsuta showing the \\"sparrow's beak\\" fruits that earned it the earlier generic name of Passerina. The genus name Thymelaea is a combination of the Greek name for the herb thyme Œ∏œçŒºŒøœÇ (th√∫mos) and that for the olive ·ºêŒªŒ±ŒØŒ± (ela√≠a) - in reference to its thyme-like foliage and olive-like fruit; while the English name sparrow-wort (used by Thomas Green in his 18th century Universal Herbal) is a translation of the name of the genus Passerina, (in which Thymelaea was formerly placed), derived from the Latin word passer \\"sparrow\\" - given the plant because of a perceived similarity of the shape of the fruit to a sparrow's beak. The qualification \\"shaggy\\" in the name shaggy sparrow-wort refers to the plant's indumentum of woolly trichomes (plant hairs) - referenced also in the Latin specific name hirsuta \\"hairy\\". The Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening ed. Chittenden, Fred J., 2nd edition, by Synge, Patrick M. Volume III : Je-Pt. Pub. Oxford at the Clarendon Press 1965. Reprinted 1984. Distribution Circum-Mediterranean: in dry coastal regions of Southern Europe, Turkey, and desert areas of the Levant and North Africa. Medicinal Uses Thirteenth century Andalusian physician and botanist Ibn al-Baitar noted that, in his day, the leaves of the plant were used to treat pinworms and skin conditions, in addition to being employed as a potent hydrogogue cathartic and expectorant; while the bark was used to promote wound healing (see also bioactive dressings). Medicinal use of this plant continues to this day: a decoction of the leaves being used as a mouthwash to dislodge carious teeth. Other uses include remedies for eye diseases and treatments for paralysis. Thymelaea hirsuta is also valued in the traditional veterinary practices of the Bedouin, in which it is used as a topical medication to prevent miscarriage in camels: the leaves are pounded and mixed with a small quantity of salt to make a poultice applied to the animal's cervix after impregnation, in the belief that this will cause the organ to contract, preventing abortion of the foetus. Scientific analyses of the plant have gone some way to providing a basis for the efficacy of this practice, with the isolation of the phytosterol stigmasterol, which is a precursor of the hormone progesterone, used to treat recurrent abortion in humans. Useful Fibre The inner bark of Thymelaea hirsuta yields a strong fibre, well suited to the making of ropes and paper. Bedouin cordage made from mitnan ranges from a type of simple cable, braided from the flexible branches of the shrub in an unworked state, to fully finished rope. Such rope is strong enough to support the weight of an adult human, to provide guy ropes for a tent, to tether, girth and yoke beasts of burden, such as donkeys and camels, and to lash together heavy water vessels so they may be carried by such animals.

History The facilities on the 65-acre site were originally constructed in 1869 as a prison for disabled convicts known as the Woking Convict Invalid Prison. The prison had 613 inmates, both male and female, by 1870. The buildings were converted into barracks capable of accommodating two infantry battalions in 1892 and initially became the home of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal West Surrey Regiment. The barracks were named after the Battle of Inkerman, a conflict during the Crimean War. The Royal Military Police, who had previously been based at a hutted camp at Mytchett, made it their depot in 1947. It remained the location for all military police training until a new depot was established at Roussillon Barracks in Chichester in 1964. After the barracks closed in 1970, the site was sold to the local council and developed for residential use.

The course of this river flows into the St. Lawrence in the hamlet of Bas-de-l'Anse, northeast of the town of La Malbaie. The valley of this watercourse is served by route 138 (Malcolm-Fraser Blvd.) which runs along the northwest shore of the St. Lawrence River and by route Sainte-Mathilde East. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities (including resort and bed and breakfasts), second. The surface of this stream is generally frozen from mid-December to late-March. Nevertheless, safe ice traffic is generally from late December to mid-March.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the \\"Loutre River\\" are: * North side: Port au Persil River, Noire River, Port au Saumon River, Saguenay River; * East side: St. Lawrence River; * South side: St. Lawrence River; * West side: Baptiste-Jean brook, Comport√© River, Jacob River, Snigole River, Malbaie River . The Loutre River originates from a small unidentified lake (length: ; altitude: ) in forest area. From the mouth of this head lake, the course of the Loutre River descends by traveling according to the following segments: * south by cutting a forest road to a bend in the river, corresponding to the confluence of a creek (coming from the east); * south to a creek (coming from the east); * southerly, bypassing the hamlet of Bas-de-Anse, to the bridge of route 138; * southeasterly down the cliff in a forest area to the shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Toponymy The origin of the name \\"rivi√®re √† la Loutre\\" is related to the presence of otters in this area. The toponym \\"rivi√®re √† la Loutre\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Bank of place names of the Commission de toponymie du Quebec.

Jenkins works on human‚Äìcomputer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.  Early life and education  Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean‚Äôs List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matariƒá on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.  Research and career  In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an Assistant Professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a Professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute. Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him. Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Lifeboat Foundation.

He is a member of the South Korean boy group Got7 under JYP Entertainment.  Biography  Born as Mark Yien Tuan in Los Angeles, California, he spent a number of years in Paraguay and Brazil before eventually returning to California, where he grew up. He is of Taiwanese descent, and has two older sisters and one younger brother. He took violin and piano lessons in elementary school, and moved to guitar in junior high school. He attended Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California. In 2010, while with his friends at school, he caught the attention of a JYP Entertainment scout, who invited him to the auditions. Tuan had no desire to pursue a musical career but was encouraged by his friends and family told him it was a good opportunity and thus, he gave it a try. He subsequently passed the audition and dropped out of school, which he attended until grade 10. He moved to South Korea in August 2010, where he learned acrobatics for one year, and martial arts for two years. Learning to sing, rap and dance, and performing on a stage as a trainee, inspired him to pursue the idol life and to become a singer.  Career   2012‚Äì2013: Pre-debut  In 2012, Tuan made a cameo in the first episode of Dream High 2 as a backup dancer alongside co-members and main actors, JB and Jinyoung. He appeared in the fourth episode of Mnet's 2013 reality-survival program WIN: Who is Next, which presented iKon and Winner members of YG. It also featured fellow Got7 member's Jackson, BamBam and Yugyeom.  2014‚Äìpresent: Debut and solo career  On January 16, 2014, Tuan debuted as a part of K-pop boy group Got7, with the EP Got It?. Since his debut, Tuan has expressed his goals in working harder to become a singer- songwriter and making his own music. Tuan officially began writing rap and lyrics for many Got7 songs since the Just Right EP, with the track \\"Back To Me\\". He contributed heavily to Flight Log: Turbulence, participating in the rap and lyric making in five out of thirteen songs, including \\"My Home\\" and \\"Let Me\\".

In December 2018, Tuan suffered from a leg injury while practicing martial arts tricking for the JYP Nation stage and could not perform at the event or at later schedules including the fifth anniversary fan meeting for Got7, therefore he stayed seated for most of the concert. Tuan continues to provide support and donations through his work, such as charity donations through his clothing line collaboration and his second single, \\"‰ªéÊú™ÂØπ‰Ω†ËØ¥Ëøá\\". In February 2020, he donated towards the purchase of ventilators for the COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei, China.

On January 4, 1946 he was given the Democratic nomination for Ward Four's alderman seat and was elected without opposition. He would continue to serve on the board for thirteen years and during that time was elected as president of the board of aldermen. On February 3, 1959 he announced his candidacy for Burlington's mayoralty and was given the Democratic nomination on February 7. Incumbent Republican Mayor C. Douglas Cairns chose to not run for reelection and Fitzpatrick defeated Paul C. Dorn in a landslide by 994 votes with 4,920 votes to 3,926 votes. During his tenure he and the board of alderman signed a petition asking President Eisenhower to review the order that would close the Ethan Allen Air Force Base. On March 7 Robert K.

It is the first of four novels featuring the Prizzis, a powerful family of Mafiosi in New York City. In all four novels the protagonist is a top member of the family named Charlie Partanna. It was adapted into a successful film of the same name. Plot summary The opening lines of the New York Times review summarize the complexities of the novel: > CHARLEY PARTANNA, underboss of the Prizzi crime family, has a problem. He's > just bumped off a traitor in Vegas who'd fleeced the organization to the > tune of $720,000 - and now he's discovered that his new girlfriend, Irene, > was the dead man's wife. As if that weren't enough of a headache, Charley's > also learned that she's been augmenting her income as a tax consultant by > working as a freelance hitter, and that she's now been offered a contract by > a family rival to do the number on him. What a business for a woman! Charley > grouses. This is a serious thing. We were going to get married. You think > she decided what business? asks his father, Angelo, consigliere to the > Prizzis. She's an American! She had a chance to win even more money so she > grabbed it!New York Times review Complexity builds upon complexity, irony builds upon irony, murder follows murder, and tension mounts as the improbable story of the two married killers races to its climax. Condon's style Condon attacked his targets, usually gangsters, financiers, and politicians, wholeheartedly but with a uniquely original style and wit that made almost any paragraph from one of his books instantly recognizable. Reviewing one of his works in the International Herald Tribune, the well-known playwright George Axelrod (The Seven-Year Itch, Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter), who had collaborated with Condon on the screenplay for the film adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, wrote: > \\"The arrival of a new novel by Richard Condon is like an invitation to a > party.... the sheer gusto of the prose, the madness of his similies, the > lunacy of his metaphors, his infectious, almost child-like joy in composing > complex sentences that go bang at the end in the manner of exploding cigars > is both exhilarating and as exhausting as any good party ought to be.\\" In Prizzi's Honor Condon's normal exuberance is somewhat muted because the entire book is narrated through the viewpoints of the semi-literate underworld characters who populate it. Nevertheless, on the first page of the book, we have Don Corrado Prizzi, the 84-year-old leader of the family, attending a wedding: > He was asleep, but even in repose his face was as subtly distorted and > burnished as that of a giant crown of thorns starfish predator. Every few > moments both small, sharp eyes, as merry as ice cubes, would open, make a > reading, then close again. Real-life names in the book All of Condon's books have, to an unknown degree, the names of real people in them as characters, generally very minor or peripheral. The most common, which appears in most of his books, is some variation of Franklin M. Heller. The real-life Heller was a television director in New York City in the 1950s, '60s, and 70s, who initially lived on Long Island and then moved to a house on Rockrimmon Road in Stamford, Connecticut.Remembrance of Frank Heller, by Ira Skutch, at In this book Marxie Heller plays a somewhat more important role than usual, being the husband of Charley's future wife, Irene, before being shot to death by Charley in the garage of Irene's Los Angeles home. Reception The New York Times gave it a very favorable long review, comparing it to Condon's previously best-known book, The Manchurian Candidate: > Of course, Mr. Condon is an old pro at mixing satire and suspense. Twenty > years ago, he began a novel with an outlandish comic premise: Since Joe > McCarthy couldn't have done more for the Communists if he had been one > himself, suppose he had been? His answer to that question, The Manchurian > Candidate, the first of what has been a long string of best sellers for Mr. > Condon, was one of the finest thrillers of recent times and perhaps the most > darkly amusing look ever at the McCarthy era. Prizzi's Honor also involves a > humorous variation on a real-life theme... Twenty years after The Manchurian > Candidate, it's nice to know that Mr. Condon is still up to his sly tricks. > In his case, at least, it's a pleasure that - as he tells us an old Sicilian > proverb has it - The less things change, the more they remain the same.The > New York Times Book Review, April 18, 1982, page 12,For Love and Money, by > Robert Asahina Kirkus Review, however, was far less charitable. After a long synopsis of the plot, it concluded: > Believable? Not really. Hilarious? Now and then in the opening chapter--with > the portrait of likable/ dumb/lethal Charley and his reactions to Irene's > secret life (\\"\\"What a business for a woman!\\"\\"). But all too soon the lovers' > matter-of-fact murdering becomes sick instead of offbeat, while Condon's > cheerful non-stop vulgarity shifts from gritty to gross. And, though > intermittently inspired in its low-life linguistics, this rather slow-paced, > loose-plotted farce/melodrama succeeds neither as dog-eat-dog black comedy > nor as Mafioso thriller/romance.Kirkus Review, April 12, 1982, at References Category:1982 novels Category:Novels by Richard Condon ","title":"Prizzi's Honor (novel)"},{"id":"62527284","text":"Suitcase Sam is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Toronto, Ontario.

Atherton was elected to one term as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1869 to 1871, and served as a Democrat. As a third generation distiller, he was best known for Atherton Whiskey, a brand he owned until 1899. Early life He was born in LaRue County, Kentucky, on April 1, 1841 , the son of Peter Atherton and Elizabeth Mayfield. Education  He attended Saint Joseph's in Bardstown, Kentucky; followed by Georgetown College, Kentucky and Louisville Law School. Whiskey distiller and advocate Prior to Prohibition, Atherton was a sour mash whiskey distiller. He entered this profession early on in his career. Distillery owner J. M. Atherton Company was founded in 1867, when Atherton was 26 years old. His stepfather, Marshall Key was his partner. It is likely there were other investors. Over a 10-year period the number of employees increased to 200, making the company the largest employer in LaRue County. Other business enterprises followed. The Atherton Hotel opened, and Athertonville, Kentucky grew up around this location, with a courthouse and a school. Soon after, the town was named in his honor. His portfolio of whiskey brands included: ‚ÄúAtherton‚Äù (from 1867), ‚ÄúMayfield‚Äù (from 1869), ‚ÄúWindsor‚Äú, ‚ÄúClifton‚Äú and ‚ÄúHoward‚Äù, ‚ÄúCarter‚Äù and ‚ÄúKenwood‚Äù, ‚ÄúBrownfield‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaker‚Äù. At the age of 41, in 1882 he had acquired a total of four distilleries within LaRue County, which combined, made him the biggest Bourbon producer in the United States. His two distilleries in Athertonville were Mayfield and Atherton, and were located on opposite sides of Knob Creek, a short distance from Knob Creek Farm, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln. His son Peter Lee Atherton (1862‚Äì1939) entered the family business. In 1882 he relocated J. M. Atherton Company headquarters to Whiskey Row, Louisville on 125 W Main St. This historic area of the city is now referred to as West Main District, Louisville. At the height of its capacity the company used 2,200 bushels of grain and produced 6,600 gallons of Whiskey. His maximum storage capacity at Athertonville, Kentucky was 150,000 gallons. As a distiller and as a director of the Distillers and Cattle Feeders' Trust (more commonly known as the Whisky Trust), he was subject to some controversy when the Whiskey Ring scandal erupted and was first reported in the New York Times in 1882. By 1888 Atherton was prominent distiller. The whiskey scandal continued for the following decade with Atherton testifying to a congressional committee headed by William Windom on July 27, 1888. During his testimony Henry Smith, representative for Wisconsin asked whether the cheep rectifier whiskeys made by large scale mid-Western manufacturers had any redeeming qualities. Atherton responded with sarcasm: Atherton eventually sold all his stock in J. M. Atherton Company to the Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Company in 1899, in order to focus on his real estate business. This was reported in the New York Times on May 12, 1899. Spokesman for the distilling industry Anti- alcohol fervor ran strong and dry forces successfully promoted Prohibition as a solution for many societal ills. This movement had been gathering pace for nearly a century, during his own fathers lifetime. He was a founding director of the Kentucky Distillers Association. He opposed constitutional prohibition and in 1886 was a national founder and first president of the National Protective Association. Ultimately the never-ending campaign by the dry forces movement was a factor when he made a business decision in 1899 to dispense of his controlling stock in the J M Atherton Company. However, he continued to represent ‚Äúcommunity interest‚Äù, of the distillers, his business partners, and former employees, even after he diversified his business interests, writing letters to newspapers arguing against the Eighteenth amendment. He would have been deeply disappointed by the 1918 vote. The vicinity around the distillery had prospered greatly. He witnessed first hand the momentum of the Temperance movement gathering pace leading up to Prohibition; the immediate loss of jobs and the impact on the local economy. Agents raided the prestigious Pendennis Club, of which he was a founding member, confiscating large amounts of alcohol. There was also an increase in the acts of lawlessness, like thefts of whiskey from private establishments by gun-wielding bandits. Prohibition was enacted in 1919, and would remain in place the rest of his life. Although prohibition continued until December 5, 1933, one year after his death, LaRue would remain a dry county. Banker & Real Estate Atherton had vast real estate holdings within Kentucky and served on several boards of directors. He served as the president of Lincoln Savings Bank and Trust Company. However, in 1881 he was elected to the board of the Bank of Kentucky (later rebranded Kentucky National Bank), located at the heart of the central business district at 300 West Main Street, Louisville. He became its director, a position he held until 1928. The seven story building was known for its Richardsonian Romanesque architecture designed by the McDonald Brothers (architects). He was a Director of the Louisville Realty Company and owned many buildings in the city. The Western Union main office stood at 405-409 W. Market Street, adjacent to the Lincoln Savings Bank, both were built on land he owned, and were in a long succession of architectural commissions linking Alfred S. Joseph (of Joseph & Joseph), and Mr. Atherton. Most prominent in terms of size within downtown Louisville, was the Atherton Building , formerly located at 610 S. Fourth Street. Later renamed as the Francis Building, until it was demolished in 1979. His financial affiliations were numerous. By 1903 his son was fully empowered in the business. Seelbach Realty Company was incorporated that year, the company that owned and leased out the Seelbach Hotel. In the 1920s Atherton began setting up a number of trusts, transferring control of other parties, to his only son. However, when his son died less than seven years after his own death, a taxation question arose , and some cases, particular the ownership of the Atherton Building, which housed the H.P. Selman Department store would not be settled until the mid-1940s. Politician He was a was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1869 to 1871, serving as a Democrat. Atherton was an active participant in Kentucky's agenda build up Kentucky's overland transportation links in order for the region to prosper. His son, Peter, was also a businessman and state legislator, and became known as the ‚ÄúFather of the Jackson Highway‚Äú , having formed part of the Jefferson Highway Association between 1911 and 1918. A Democrat all his life, in the 1920s he gave a speech at the Kentucky Democratic convention entitled \\"The Drop of Sweat.\\" relating to the issue of free silver. He was in favor of the gold standard. Railroad enterprises A few years earlier he had built his own depot and connected the line from New Haven, KY with an Louisville & Nashville railroad spur. In 1898 he was elected to the board of directors of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, along with twelve other individuals. He was clear candidate, since he had already been a director of the Louisville Gas & Electric since 1884. Civic roles He was also chairman of the City Government Committee, which studied municipal reform and was a member of the Louisville Board of Education in 1884. In the 1920s he was the head of the committee making a 25-page report making recommendations to reorganize local government in Louisville. He received Civic Recognition in 1924 when the Louisville Board of Education named a new school J. M. Atherton High School for Girls, in honor of his work in furthering education for Kentucky. Memberships He was a founding member of the Pendennis Club, Louisville Jockey Club and the Big Spring Country Club. Personal On October 24, 1861 he married Maria B. Farnam, the daughter of his professor. He moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1873. They had a child together. In 1905, John McDougal Atherton moved to 2542 Ransdell Avenue in the fashionable Cherokee Triangle area of Louisville. Family His father, Peter Atherton, died aged seventy-three, when John was three years old. His mother, Elizabeth (n√©e Mayfield) (1808‚Äì1885) remarried, and his stepfather, Marshall Key (1806‚Äì1877), became highly influential in his life and this guardianship encouraged many high-profile distillery ventures, enabling him to build his first distillery at the age of 26. His stepfather died in 1877 and was buried in the same plot as Atherton's biological father, and his older brother, Peter M. , who died in 1862. His mother, Elizabeth Atherton Key was also buried there upon her death in 1885. During his long life Atherton had amassed a substantial estate. His son continued the business affairs but died in 1939. As a recent wealthy widow, his daughter-in-law, Cornelia A. Atherton sponsored the USS Atherton , following the tragic loss of her son in 1942, Lt. (jg.) John M. Atherton (1918-1942), a Line Officer onboard USS Meredith (DD-434) torpedoed and sunk during the Asiatic-Pacific Theater of World War II on October 25, 1942. A few years later she was recognised as a Gold Star Mother. Ironically USS Atherton was transferred to Japan in 1955. Death Atherton died on June 5, 1932. His wife, Maria, has died 14 years earlier. Legacy He was regarded by many historians to be a person of importance to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Some also refer to him as a pre-prohibition Kentucky Whiskey Baron. He is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery, Louisville, a stones throw away from other Whiskey Barons, such as George Garvin Brown, Paul Jones, Julian P. Van Winkle and Frederick Stitzel, as well as the most influential people of Louisville. Ancestry His paternal grandfather, Aaron Atherton (1745‚Äì1821), was part of a group of settlers who travelled through the Cumberland Gap, led by Samuel Goodwin, who in 1780 founded Goodin or Goodwin Fort, as a frontier settlement of Virginia. It was a time of sieges and skirmishes with local tribes, with the settlement being raised in July 1781. Following the American Revolutionary War more settlers arrived. By the time Kentucky established statehood over this area, Aaron and his son, Peter Atherton (1771-1844) had been operating a small distillery on the banks of Rolling Fork River at Knob Creek for over thirty years, since around 1790 making them one of the first whiskey pioneers of Kentucky Peter and Aaron's legacy survived and passed to John. Aaron Atherton's home in Hodgenville, KY was admitted to the National Register of Historic Places. His maternal great grandfather was Alexander McDougall, a merchant and privateer, a Sons of Liberty leader from New York City, who served as a General during the Revolutionary War and on cessation of hostilities became the first President of the Bank of New York.

Under her gif, RaFia is quoted: ‚ÄúPeople of color are underrepresented in every community that white people have ever presented due to the conditioning we‚Äôve received that white is standard. White people are looked at and heard first while POC are represented only if they excel past that standard. Until we‚Äôve abolished the white standard, people of color will always be underrepresented. We‚Äôre all here though.‚Äù Worked (2015) Worked is a digitally manipulated image of the artist, partially naked with her lower body away from the camera as she gazes forward whilst wearing an apron.

Supporters of the theory allege physical differences in facial features, bodily dimensions, or behavior between the original and replacement Melania, and changes in President Donald Trump's language in referring to Melania. Theories have arisen at several periods during Trump's presidency, particularly in October 2017, May-June 2018, and March 2019. Trump himself has addressed the theory through tweets and in comments to reporters, denouncing it as false and \\"fake news\\". Mainstream media sources have labelled the theory false, calling it for example \\"a ridiculous conspiracy theory\\" and \\"a non-story.\\" Website Vox described the theory as conforming with a narrative outsiders have created about Melania, which \\"paints Melania as either unwilling to be part of the administration or as someone who hates her husband so much that she‚Äôs found a body double to stand in\\". Origins Donald and Melania Trump in Alabama, March 2018. Some believe the woman pictured here was not the real Melania. In October 2017, The Guardian columnist Marina Hyde claimed to have inadvertently launched the theory by tweeting on 13 October, \\"Absolutely convinced Melania is being played by a Melania impersonator these days. Theory: she left him weeks ago\\". Another source wrote that the theory had already been circulating for months by then. An October 13 Facebook post of the theory by an actress named Andrea Wagner Barton quickly gained nearly a hundred thousand shares. Others noted an image where Melania was accompanied by another woman, appearing to be a Secret Service agent, with a very similar appearance. Some found it suspicious that Trump referred aloud to \\"my wife, Melania, who happens to be right here.\\" On May 14, 2018, Melania reportedly underwent an embolization, which is a minimally invasive procedure that deliberately blocks a blood vessel in order to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was reportedly successful and without complications. During this period she was not seen in public for five weeks, while the White House refused for most of that period to comment on her absence at all, spurring further theories. In one instance, when asked about Melania, Trump told pool reporters that she was watching them from a window, pointing to the window, which was clearly empty. Following Melania's reported return to the White House following surgery, Trump tweeted a welcome which misspelled her name as \\"Melanie\\". An alternative theory proposed after the surgery episode was that Melania had had plastic surgery, possibly a facelift or breast enlargement, resulting in different appearance. The body double theory arose again in July 2018, from images of Melania exiting Air Force One in Brussels. The theory was raised again in 2019 following a Trump visit to an Alabama tornado site. The TV show The View had a segment on \\"a surge of internet chatter about the former fashion model‚Äôs Alabama appearance under the #fakeMelania hashtag.\\" Response After the Alabama trip, Donald Trump tweeted \\"the Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it‚Äôs actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places.\\" Trump gave no evidence of any photoshopped pictures. Melania's spokeswoman called the segment on The View \\"shameful\\" and \\"beyond petty\\". One scholar, University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld, noted that this conspiracy theory follows a long line of such claims of noted figures: \\"Pornographic libelles featuring a sex-obsessed Marie-Antoinette in the years before the French Revolution are simply the ancestors of today's 'news stories' claiming Michelle Obama or Melania Trump is actually a man, or a body double, or a lesbian, or anything else salacious.\\"Sophia Rosenfeld, Democracy and Truth: A Short History (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018), page 13. Late night talk show host Stephen Colbert has poked fun at the theory by having actress Laura Benanti appear on his show as a Melania impersonator.

He is the editor of The Andrew Marr Show, Politics Live, Newscast on television, Newswatch and The Westminster Hour.  Biography  Burley grew up in the 1970s and 1980s and was interested in politics from a young age. He obtained a degree in American studies from the University of Nottingham. He began his career as a researcher for the Labour Party Member of Parliament Paul Flynn. He joined ITV in 1996 and rose to become editor of their political shows The Sunday Edition and Jonathan Dimbleby. He also worked on Tonight, hosted by Trevor McDonald. He joined the BBC in 2008 and became executive editor of Question Time, deputy editor of Newsnight and assistant editor of BBC Breakfast. In 2018, he became the BBC's editor of live political programmes, succeeding Robbie Gibb. The role is based in Westminster and led Burley to take responsibility for the programmes Daily Politics, Sunday Politics, This Week, The Westminster Hour and Newswatch. When Daily Politics ended in 2018, Burley became editor of Politics Live, and later editor of The Andrew Neil Show and executive producer of the podcast Brexitcast on television. The first episode of Politics Live generated criticism online because it featured a panel of five women. Burley said he had \\"zero shame\\" about the episode and that they had \\"invited people and they said yes and then we realised our best line-up was all female\\". Following a November 2019 edition of Question Time, claims arose that a Brexit and Boris Johnson supporter in the show's audience was Burley's son. The fact-checking organisation Full Fact said the false claim originated from a spoof Twitter account. The audience member's real identity was revealed to be a 19-year-old Conservative Party member, Layton J Smith. Brexitcast was renamed Newscast after the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on 31 January 2020. The final edition of Brexitcast was released on 1 February 2020, with the first edition of Newscast airing on 6 February. Burley lives in Brighton and supports Liverpool F.C.

Early life Mayo was born in Ogdensburg, New York on April 15, 1811. He was the son of Obed Mayo, a shipbuilder, and Elizabeth (n√©e Starbuck) Mayo. On his father's side, he was descended from the Rev. John Mayo, the first minister of the North Church in Boston. On his mother's side, he was descended from the Nantucket whaling and merchant Starbuck family. Career Mayo attended an academy in Potsdam and after choosing a career in medicine, he studied under two local physicians before attending the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York (today a part of Columbia University). After completing his medical studies in 1832, he practiced for a few years in Ogdensburg, but after due to ill health, he left America to take a tour of Spain and the Barbary Coast of North Africa. His subsequent work as an author was largely based on these travel experiences. Mayo returned to America, relocated his medical practice to New York City, and began to write professionally. Personal life In 1851, Mayo was married to Helen Cornelia (n√©e Stuyvesant) Dudley Olmsted (1808‚Äì1890). By the time of their marriage, Helen was a widow of Henry Dudley and Francis Olmsted. She was the daughter of Nicholas William Stuyvesant (and a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland) and the former Catherine Livingston Reade, a descendant of Gilbert Livingston and Robert Livingston the Elder, the first Lord of Livingston Manor. Helen and William had no children together. He died in New York on November 22, 1895. His funeral was held at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery in Manhattan.

It premiered at Central State University in 1987. A fully staged revival took place in 2014 in Modesto, California.  Background  Tawawa House is based on a real-life place in Ohio and set in 1852. In the town of Wilberforce, Ohio, there was a watering hole called Tawawa by the Native Americans in the area. A large, 300 room house, that served as a hotel in Wilberforce eventually became known as \\"Tawawa House.\\" Tawawa House was \\"notorious for its popularity among slaveholders and their enslaved mistresses\\" during the 1850s. Travelers and vacationers were drawn to the natural springs in the area and stayed at the resort owned by lawyer and state legislator, Elias Drake. Slaves that worked at the hotel were able to earn their freedom and get an education. The house was also part of the underground railroad. Later, the site became Wilberforce College. Wilberforce was the first black-owned college in the United States. Perry found the story of Tawawa House especially interesting due to her own multiracial heritage. When she first moved to Wilberforce, Ohio, she began to research the history of the town and found the story of Tawawa House. Powell dedicated the opera to her parents.  About  Powell started writing the libretto in 1974. The first performance of Tawawa House took place at Central State University in the Paul Robeson Cultural and Performing Arts Center in 1987. It was staged by Lois McGuire and Cheryl Welch and the orchestra was directed by Donald Carroll. Perry's daughter, Janis, performed as a singer in the first performance of the opera. The first fully staged production with sets and complete score was not performed until 2014 at the Townsend Opera in Modesto, California. The opera starts with an overture using \\"pentatonic melodic lines and harmonies based on seventh, ninth and eleventh chords. The first chorus is made up of then entire cast. Tawawa House's score, reflects the influence of her teachers, Dett, Dawson and Mihaud. Tawawa House features a \\"unique fusion of traditional Negro Spirituals and western classical music.\\" Songs written for Tawawa House include \\"Jumping Over the Broom\\" and \\"Follow the Drinkin' Gourd.\\" With intermission, the piece is 2 hours long. The story told in the opera involves the lives of escaped slaves.

Fazio. This type of priming entails the evaluation of people, ideas, objects, goods, etc., not only based on the physical features of those things, but also on affective context. The affective context may come from previous life experiences, and therefore, primes may arouse emotions rather than ideas. Most research and concepts about affective priming derive from the affective priming paradigm, which looks to make judgments of neutral affective targets following positive, neutral, or negative primes. A prominent derivation of affective priming paradigm is the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP), developed by Payne, Cheng, Govorun, and Stewart. The main idea of AMP is to measure implicit attitudes, therefore, if the evaluation of the prime stimuli of an object is positive, it is said that the person has a positive attitude toward the object exposed.  Affective priming paradigm  The intent of this affective priming paradigm had initially the intent of eliminating the bias created by affective priming research self-reports. As a consequence, Fazio created the affective priming paradigm, which focuses on the evaluation of automatic stimuli. One finding of studies that use this paradigm says that ‚Äúperformance is typically faster and more accurate when a prime and target are congruent and have the same emotional information (e.g., ‚Äúflower‚Äù‚Äì‚Äúwedding‚Äù) compared with when they are incongruent and have different emotional information (e.g., ‚Äúparty‚Äô ‚Äì‚Äúcorpse‚Äù).‚Äù  Affective automatic response  Affective priming has been long said to be related to implicit attitudes . Some research suggests that affective priming is triggered by multiple, simultaneous mechanisms. Added to this, it has found that deeper processing of the target being evaluated can significantly hinder the influence of the prime. On the other hand, deeper processing prime significantly increases the prime‚Äôs influence and it is retrieved more easily in subsequent occasions. There is still a great need of research related to affective priming and automatic processing. Some arguments in favor of a strong relationship between the two argue that these affective priming processes 1) lack intentionality, 2) are highly efficient, 3) have reduced controllability, 4) are triggered at a high speed, especially when there is a motivationally relevant stimulus, and 5) there is reduced awareness of the origin, meaning, and occurrence of the response. Seib-Pfeifer and Gibbons have suggested that affective priming processing is linked to the right central-to-parieto-occipital positive slow wave (PSW). Other factors that contribute to this relationship between affective priming and automatic processing include switching tasks, salience asymmetry, and potentially strategic recoding.  Valence vs arousal  There is much discussion in the world of psychology about the effects of valence and arousal in affect priming, since they both seem to affect it, but there has been little research on which of the two has a greater effect on this type of priming. For example, one study by Yao, Shu, and Luo asserts that valence has a greater effect, based on their findings regarding the stability of valence-driven priming effects against arousal-driven effects and their information in the semantic system.

Hecquet was an ascetic, Cartesian mechanist and vegetarian.Preece, Rod. (2008). Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought. UBC Press. p. 177. He was influenced by Porphyry. Hecquet was concerned with health from a diet perspective and campaigned against the consumption of meat, stating it interfered with digestion and circulation of the blood. Hecquet noted how the rich often consumed much expensive meat, spicy sauces and strong wine which was bad for health.L. W. B. Brockliss. (1989). The Medico-Religious Universe of an Early Eighteenth- Century Parisian Doctor: The Case Philippe Hecquet. In Roger French; Andrew Wear. The Medical Revolution of the Seventeenth Century. Cambridge University Press. p. 202. He argued that such a diet was difficult for the body to digest and impaired the elasticity of the fluid-bearing organs. He stated that if flesh was to be eaten it should only be fish. He believed that fruits, grains, nuts and seeds should replace meat. Hecquet was a Jansenist Catholic and promoted a \\"theological medicine\\".Puskar-Pasewicz, Margaret. (2010). Cultural Encyclopedia of Vegetarianism. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 106. He argued that the Garden of Eden depicted a vegetarian regime. Hecquet argued that all physiological processes could be reduced to simple mechanisms.

In 1916, Doris married prominent violinist Francesco Ferramosca (b. Francescantonio Ferramosca, August 23, 1893, Viggiano, Italy). After Ferramosca died in 1932, she married Michele Scuto (name changed to Scuto Mitchell). After Mitchell died a few years later, she married the big-game hunter John Francois Burger. With Burger, she traveled extensively throughout Southern Africa, big-game hunting and gold panning. Accompanying them on their journeys was Doris' pet leopard, Spots. These expeditions are documented in various books written by Burger.

Ali himself was a descendant of Adnan a vassal and contemporary of the famous 7th Century BC Babylonian Emperor Nebuchadnezzar II. Adnan as an Ishmaelite traced his descent back to Ishmael and therefore the Barha Dynasty traces its ancestry back to the Biblical Prophet Abraham through his eldest son Ishmael. It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in India and the world, and consists of Abdullah al Wasiti, the founder of the dynasty, and his male-line descendants, who ruled in South Asia from their arrival at the close of the 10th Century until the second half of the 20th Century. When the abolition of Indian Princely States including the Princely State of Rampur ruled by the Rohilla branch of the Barha Dynasty brought their rule to an end. The dynasty is well known for the martial prowess of its members who always lead their armies from the vanguard. However, it is best remembered for its member's role as de facto rulers over most of South Asia at the start of the 18th Century, as well as their general tolerance to their non-Muslim subjects. The Nawabs of Rampur eliminated communal violence and during the Partition Riots when other rulers such as those of the Sikh States, Alwar and Bharatpur widely believed to have ordered the ethnic cleansing of their Muslim subjects, the Nawab however, strictly forbade his hot-blooded Pashtun nobles from committing reprisal attacks against non-Muslims. While the powerful Nawab Hussain Ali Khan and Nawab Abdullah Khan abolished poll tax against non-Muslims throughout India, brought the Marathas into the Mughal fold and helped win over Hindu Rajasthani rulers like Ajit Singh of Marwar.  Etymology  The meaning of the name Barha is uncertain. While some contend that it comes from the word, \\"bahir\\", meaning \\"outsider\\" referring to the preference of members of the Barha dynasty to live outside Delhi, to avoid scandalised localities such as Mina Bazar which would be unsuited for their sacred natures. Others like the Emperor Jahangir, believed that it came from the Hindi word, \\"barha\\", meaning \\"twelve\\". In reference to the twelve townships that members of the dynasty had received as fiefs from Sultan Shibabdudin of Ghor when they first arrived in India.  Ancestry  The dynasty descends in the male line from the fourth Rashidun Caliph, Ali, through his younger son Hussain who married Shahrbanu, herself a daughter of the Sassanian emperor of Persia, Yazdegard III. Due to Ali's status as an Adnanite, the dynasty can trace its ancestry to Abraham through his eldest son Ishmael. In Arabia, the ancestor's of the dynasty took part in many rebellions against Abbasid authority. One ancestor, Isa bin Zayd, revolted against the Caliph Al Mahdi and was consequently poisoned by that caliph at the age of 45. Subsequently, the dynasty were heavily persecuted by the Abbasid government, and eventually the founder of the Barha dynasty, Abul Farah Al Wasiti, fled from Madina to Wasit and from there he fled to the Ghaznavid Empire. His four sons entered into the military service of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni and received twelve fiefs in Punjab, then a part of the Ghaznavid Empire, as reward for their service. Thus the dynasty became quickly established as Nobles of the Sword in ancient India, a status they held under several different empires. They held a particularly high status under the Sultanate of Delhi. When the Chief of the Barha, who was also the Diwan of the empire, was granted the fief of Saharanpur due to his relation with the imperial family. They also enjoyed particularly prominent positions under the reign of the Sur, eventually defecting during the last days in the reign of Sikander Sur of the Sur Empire, to the Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire in the course of the siege of Mankot . The Barha dynasty maintains the unique status of having been the only dynasty to participate in all three Battles of Panipat, seminal battles which shaped Indian History. Under the Lodi in the First Battle of Panipat. In the Second Battle of Panipat they gained victory under Bairam Khan, and finally in the Third Battle Of Panipat, the sons of Nawab Ali Muhammad Khan Rohilla fought with Ahmed Shah Abidali against the Maratha. By the time of the Emperor Aurangzeb, the dynasty was firmly regarded as \\"Old Nobility\\" and enjoyed the unique status of holding the premier realms of Ajmer and Dakhin. Realms usually reserved for the rule of members of the Imperial Family.  Branches  The children of Abdullah Abul Farah al wasiti settled in various towns, each eventually forming its own branch. *Sayyid Daud settled in Tihaanpur, giving rise to the Tihaanpuri branch. *Sayyid Abul Fazl settled in Chhatbannur giving rise to the Chhaturai branch. *Sayyid Najmudin Hussain settled in Jagner, giving rise to the Jagner branch. *Sayyid Fazail settled in Kundli giving rise to the Lundliwal branch. All the branches eventually migrated to the Doab where the branches occupied the following towns: *Kumhera and Dharsi by Tihaanpur *Sambalhera by Chatrauris *Jagneri by Bithauli *Majhera by Kundliwal  Tihanpur Branch  The Tihanpuri Branch has the greatest claim to fame of all the branches of the dynasty. The branch began with Sayyid Jalal Khan Emir, 8th in descent from Abdullah al wasiti. Khan Emir left Tihanpur and settled in Dharsi located in the pargana of Jauli. He had four sons, of who the eldest Umar Shahid settled in Jansath, a second son Chaman settled in Chitaura and a third son Hassan settled in Bihari and a fourth Ahmad made his home in Kawal in the pargana of Jansath.  Jansath  Umar found Jansath already occupied by Jats and Brahmins however during the branch's ascendancy in the later mughal era, the branch extended itself so much that Jansath became detached from the Jauli pargana. Its also from this branch that the famous Nawab Abdullah Khan I emerged, better known in places like Ajmer as Sayyid Mian.The branch benefited from Aurangzeb's reign and by the time Aurangzeb passed away, the branch had considerable influence with Sayyid Mian's sons Nawab Hussain Ali Khan and Nawab Abdullah Khan II being attached to the future emperor Bahadur Shah. Nawab Hussain Ali Khan and Nawab Abdullah Khan II also known as the Sayyid Brothers were positioned such that when Bahadur Shah I ascended to the throne with the help of the brothers, he granted the former the government of Patna and the latter the government of Allahbad. In 1709, Sayyid Ahmad, Sayyid Khan, Sayyid Hussain Khan and Sayyid Ghairat Khan all distinguished themselves in crushing a rebellion of Hindu Princes on the Narbada. During which they fought in the vanguard and all perished to a man with their followers. The Tihaanpuris continued to distinguish themselves in Punjab, Gujrat and along the Indus until they reach supremacy and became masters over South Asia. In 1712, the sons of Sayyid Mian, having found themselves in a dangerous position and distrustful of other ministers at Delhi, took it upon themselves to raise Prince Furrukhsiyar to the throne as Emperor. During the process the sons of Sayyid Mian distinguished themselves in battle, with Sayyid Nurudin Ali Khan, Najmudin Ali Khan and Saifudin Ali Khan having fought gallantly in the battles of Sarai Alam Chand (Allahbad) and Agra. With Nurudin Ali Khan having lost his life at Allahbad. Nawab Sayyid Hassan Ali Khan who thereafter became known as Abdullah Khan II, was appointed as Grand Vezier with the title of Qutb al Mulk, while Nawab Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan was appointed as Commander-in-Chief with the title of Amir ul Mammalik. In the demise of the Sayyid Brothers many other Sayyids of note fell with them, first with the assassination of Hussain Ali Khan and later at the Battle of Hasanpur where Abdullah Khan II was captured. Much of the Tihanpur Branch was destroyed by the efforts of Muhammad Amin Khan and Qamar ud din Khan, with only the Rohilla Dynasty having survived the general destruction of the Tihaanpuris  Chaman  The Branch of Chaman comes next in line to the Jansath Branch. Descending from Sayyid Chaman who settled in Chitura, this branch gained much influence during the reign of Shah Jahan when Sayyid Jalal become a high ranking Mansabdar and was given possession of Kharwa Jalalpur in the Sardhan pargana of Meerut. However the branch fell in decline when Sayyid Shams, son of Sayyid Jalal left Imperial service. He had two sons, Sayyid Asghar Ali and Sayyid Asad Ali. The former died childless while the descendants of the latter remained in Chitura until the Biritsh Era.  Hassan  Sayyid Hassan had six sons, many of whom rose in Imperial Service and later became Zamindars.  Ahmad  The Descendants of Sayyid Ahmad who had settled in Kawal, gained much acclaim during the reign of Aurangzeb when Tatar Khan and Diwan Muhammad Yar Khan became distinguished in Imperial Service  Khan Jahan  Sayyid Nasirudin, the sixth son Sayyid Hasan, gained much fame in the form of Sayyid Khanjahan-i-Shahjahani who attained much power under the Emperor Shahjahan and was consequently granted forty Villages in the parganas of Khatauli and Sarwat, along with several bighas of land in free revenue for perpetuity with he title of Abul Muzaffar He began to build a new town which was completed by his son and named Muzaffarnagar.  Chatrauri Branch  They, lived near Sambelhera and changed their name from Chatbanauri to Chatrauri. One of the members of this branch, Sayyid Hasan Fakhrudin, lived during the reign of Emperor Akbar. He used his influence at court to help the Raja of Sambalhera to confirm his dignity in the male line to his son, Ram Chand. Later when Ram Chand died childless, he helped the widow of Ram Chand to inherit the state. Being so pleased with the service rendered to her, she passed on the entirety of her estate to Sayyid Hassan, who was later confirmed in its possession as the Nawab of Sambelhera. Sayyid Hassan had a child named Sayyid Hussain, who in turn had four children. Sayyid Sher Ali who died without issue, Sayyid Ahmad who was killed fighting Ratan Sen of Chitor and whose descendants settled in Kailawada and another descendant fought under the Emperor Muhammad Shah, Sayyid Tajudin whose son Sayyid Umar founded Kakrauli and colonised the local towns of Rauli Nagla and Bera and the last son Sayyid Salar Auliya who obtained Kaithora in a similar manner to his grandfather. He had two sons, Sayyid Haider Khan whose descendant Sayyid Shahamat Khan settled in Miranpur and founded the Haider Khan Family and Sayyid Muhammad Khan whose descendants remained in Kaithora and formed the Muhammad Khani family. Of the Muhammad Khan family, Nusrat Yar Khan and Rukhan ad Daula gained prominence during the reign of Muhammad Shah. Gaining the governance of Agra, Gujarat and Patna. They additionally held a Jagir of twenty eight villages in Ahmedabad which they gained in return for their service in annihilating their Tihanpuri brethren and which they retained until 1850. The Chatrauris of Morna review land grants to the west of Kali near Charthawal. There is a still Mosque in Morna built in the name of the wife of Nawab Hassan Khan, bakshi of Muhammad Shah. Constructed in 1725 at the cost of 1900 rupees.  Jagneri Branch  They are descendants of Sayyid Najmudin Hussain, who first settled at Bidauli, and some generations later his descendant Sayyid Fakhrudin moved to Palri in the Jauli pargana. Where he purchased propriety rights in Palri, Chanduri, Chandura, Tulsipur and Khera. Members of this branch reached high positions during the reign of Akbar and subsequent Emperors, but none gained the prominence which characterised other branches of the dynasty. The Jagneri Branch were heavily affected by drought, resulting in less prosperous conditions. However the head of Bidauli family still served as Nazim to the Nawabs of Oudh while his nephew was a Chakladar.  Kudliwal Branch  Members of this branch settled in Mujhera. Ain-i-Akbari makes mention of Sayyid Mahmud as being the first member of the Barha dynasty to enter into timurid service. Having formerly gained employment under the Sur Empire, he defected to the Mughals during the siege of Mankot during which he was with Sikander Sur but later sided with the Emperor Akbar. In the first year of Akbar's reign he fought in a campaign against Muhammad Shah whose forced were led by Raja Hemu. In 1557 he took part in the Ajmer campaign and in the year after he took part in the capture of the fort of Jitasaran, along with an expedition against the Bhaduriyas of Hatkanth in Agra. in 1561 he was granted a Jagir near Delhi and later took part in a campaign with the Amorha Sayyids against the Raja Madhukar of Orcha. He died in 1574 and was buried in Majhera where his fort still remains. In a famous incident, Sayyid mahmud was once asked how many generations back the Barha dynasty traced its sacred descent. Incidentally a fire was burning at a spot nearby and offended by the question, Sayyid Mahmud jumped into the fire exclaiming \\"If I am a Sayyid the fire will hurt me; if I am no Sayyid I shall get burnt\\". He stood for an hour in the fire and only left after the earnest request of a bystanders. His velvet slippers showed that indeed he had no sign of being burnt by the fire.

Michael Rechtshaffen from the Los Angeles Times disliked the movie, stating: \\"A committed cast fails to elevate \\"Beneath the Leaves,\\" an otherwise draggy and derivative thriller about a psychotic killer whose M.O. involves fatally injecting his victims with potassium chloride before harvesting their fingernails.\\" John DeFore writing for The Hollywood Reporter said: \\"A by-the- book script and stiff direction fail to milk any suspense from this scenario and, in the absence of thrills, the picture's heavy focus on the long-lasting impact of trauma is suffocating. Sorvino and Polaha have no chemistry in their scenes away from the action, and some viewers who have admired the actress' vocal contributions to current harassment/assault debates will cringe at a scene where the lines \\"You want me to go?\\" and \\"Yes\\" are treated as an invitation to sex. Jones, most often seen under creature makeup, brings a few physical flourishes to his cookie-cutter psycho role, but not nearly enough to make it memorable.\\" Roger Moore from the \\"Movie Nation\\" gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars and wrote that it \\"keeps us at arm's length and the cast at half- speed, a disappointing combination when your aim was an intricate, raw-nerves thriller with visceral violence, surprises, and characters we connect with enough to root for.\\" References External links * * Category:2019 films Category:2019 thriller films Category:American films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films ","title":"Beneath the Leaves"},{"id":"62527785","text":"Argentina Santos or Maria Argentina Pinto dos Santos (February 6, 1924 ‚Äì November 18, 2019) was a Portuguese singer considered one of the last great Fado singers.

His father Sava Petroviƒá (1796-1857), an accomplished painter, seeing in his son a predilection in painting, made sure that he got the best academic training in art. Sava and his wife Maria Sibeslov came originally from a nearby village of Izvin and settled in 1814 in Timi»ôoara's suburb Fabrika, where the majority of the population was Serbian at the time. They had three sons, Nikola, Vladimir and Pavle, the youngest and the only one who took up his father's profession. When he was quite young, he served as his father's apprentice. There he learned drawing, painting, shading, colour, and the art of actually mixing paints from several natural pigments and minerals. After graduating from a gymnasium in Timi»ôoara, Sava sent Pavel to Vienna where he enrolled at the famed Academy of Fine Arts. His professor was Leopold Kupelwieser, a follower of Romantic Nazarene movement. He attended the academy at about the same time as his compatriot artists Dimitrije Avramoviƒá and Anastas Jovanoviƒá. Upon returning to his hometown, Petroviƒá received numerous painting commissions, mostly portraits, icons, and iconostasis.Later, he decided to make a living as a globe-trotting, travelling painter.

The Players' aim is to offer a broad base of productions, usually two or three per year. The society is affiliated to the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) and Fenland Arts.  History   20th century  In the 1940s Sheila Chesters whose husband Allen was the Wisbech Grammar School headmaster, started to run dancing classes for girls in the School gardens. From this strand developed a junior theatre group. In the 1950s Sheila Chesters, then chair of the County Music Committee was asked to form a children's choir. The group attended the Eistedfodd in Llangollen. In 1953 Alvin Thompson won a Folk Song class, in 1954 his brother, Michael did the same. In 1955 Basil Isley also won.In 1954 they sent a part of 36, much effort had been made to ensure authenticity in the costumes by getting a local basket maker to make replicas of hats held in the Cambridgeshire museum. Chesters scoured the area seeking out old folk songs, some of which appear never to have been printed. The Wisbech Players was founded in 1954 through the amicable break up of the Wisbech Little Theatre drama group run by Mrs Sheila Chesters, who was also busy running this successful children's choir competing at King's Lynn Festival, Albert Hall, Edinburgh and Aldeburgh. The society's production of A Hundred Years Old, by S & J Quintero took place at the Women's Institute Hall (since 2009 The Luxe Cinema). Two productions per year were put on most years once the society was established. This was eventually reduced to one. The productions at the turn of the century were Arsenic and Old Lace by Joseph Kesselring and 'Allo 'Allo based on the tv series by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft.  21st century  For the fiftieth anniversary in 2004, Joan Littlewood's Oh! What a Lovely War was put on at the Georgian Angles Theatre. The society returned to two productions in 2007 with Rebecca (play) and Steel Magnolias (play). Far from the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy and adapted by playwright Jessica Swale was the 2018 spring play. In 2019 Ladies in Lavender directed by Barbara Mews and adapted for the stage by Shaun McKenna was the Spring production performed at the Angles.

In January 2019, the Government of Dallas released an audit uncovering evidence of misuse of taxpayer funds, mismanagement, and excessive executive compensation. In November 2019, IRS Form 13909 was filed against VisitDallas calling for a public investigation by the Internal Revenue Service and Texas Attorney General. Early controversies In 2002, it was revealed the Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau(DCVB), previous name of VisitDallas, was engaged in questionable spending such as spending money on expensive golf trips, paid excessive salaries, paying for expensive liquor tabs, using limos for travel to and from the airport, and going on regular trips to local strip clubs all paid for by the DCVB. These revelations led to David Whitney, President, of the DCVB resigning with a $308,000 severance package and Chris Luna, chairman of the bureau's board of directors, stepping down. In addition, the following actions were taken: * travel and entertainment expense policies were updated * additional oversight policies and procedures created * audit of the bureau‚Äôs expenses was launched 2019 City of Dallas audit On January 4, 2019, the City of Dallas released an audit which demonstrated lax oversight, excessive executive compensation and spending, and its inability to properly track metrics for success after spending $150 million in taxpayer funds. The audit also highlighted how Phillip Jones, CEO, of VisitDallas didn't follow expense report policies having identified charges which included magazine subscriptions, valet service, and a $543 Tumi backpack. Reports submitted to the City demonstrating results from their efforts were deemed not reliable calling into question their effectiveness. The audit called into question whether the City would renew its contract which is due to expire on September 30, 2020 with many Council Members issuing calls to end it by then if not sooner. Financial mismanagement VisitDallas receives most of its revenue from hotel occupancy tax (HOT) and the Dallas Tourism Public Improvement District (DTPID), hotels in the city with 100 or more rooms averaging $30 million each year. The audit found it put all of its money into one bank account which is a direct violation of state law. It was also found that annual payments made to the Convention Center were often late and taken from the Dallas Tourism Public Improvement District (DTPID). As a result, the audit states, ‚ÄúLate capital contributions hamper [the city‚Äôs] ability to plan and fund needed facility improvements for the Convention Center,‚Äù. It concludes, ‚ÄúImproperly using DTPID funds could result in legal liability and reputational damage for the city.‚Äù In addition, the audit discovered VisitDallas ‚Äúdoes not have adequate controls over certain expenses.‚Äù Many expense reports audited by the City found they did not include documentation, exceeded VisitDallas‚Äô own policy limits, or violated state law. For example, VisitDallas has a spending cap of $180 per night but found Phillip Jones, CEO, of VisitDallas spent $17,069 on 18 hotel stays averaging $950 per night. It was also found CEO Phillip Jones spent $7,000 on gifts which were not documented in expense reports and that he had preference for using private car services instead of cheaper options like Uber or Lyft. In addition, the audit revealed Phillip Jones had access to a \\"long-term rental home\\" in Austin at a cost of $12,000 and a rental car. Since 2014, the CEO of VisitDallas paired overseas and domestic trips on behalf of the city with endurance racing contests in California, Quebec, Norway, England, and France claiming expenses were paid out of his own pocket although financial records cannot validate that claim. Excessive executive compensation Phillip Jones, CEO, of VisitDallas had an annual salary of $700,000 (an estimated $28,000 every two weeks) making him one of the highest paid tourism executives in the country. It was also discovered he received a $35,000 pay advance and had a balance due in the amount of $135,000. Speculation was made this amount was used to fund a trip to Hawaii. It was later found loans totaling $225,000 were made to Phillip Jones which were not documented on their IRS Form 990. According to state law, loans may be made by nonprofits to their executives only if they directly or indirectly benefit its mission. The exact statute reads, ‚ÄúPOWER TO ASSIST EMPLOYEE OR OFFICER. (a) A corporation may lend money to or otherwise assist an employee or officer of the corporation, but not a director, if the loan or assistance may reasonably be expected to directly or indirectly benefit the corporation.‚Äù In a statement to The Texas Monitor, it was claimed these loans were for medical treatments for Phillip Jones's son. Accusations of inflated salaries go beyond the CEO. It was found the number of employees making over $100,000 between 2016 and 2017, increased from 16 individuals to 30 even though membership fees, collected from local businesses in exchange for promotion, dropped 26%. Their 2017 IRS Form 990 included a 6% salary increase for CEO Phillip Jones and a $196,703 bonus, 11% increase for Matthew Jones, CFO, with a $128,042 bonus, and a 53% increase for Frank Librio, CMO. The Internal Revenue Service is charged with enforcing the Federal Private Inurement Prohibition prohibiting a tax-exempt organization‚Äôs decision makers‚Äîboard members, trustees, officers, or key employees‚Äîfrom receiving unreasonable benefits from the nonprofit‚Äôs income or assets. Excessive compensation paid to nonprofit executives is the most common violation of this prohibition leading to hefty fines on the persons involved. In addition, excessive executive compensation may result in the required return of the excessive amount and penalty taxes imposed on senior executives as well as the board members who approved it. {  - !

It was found no formal documentation for the methodology and formulas were used to prepare their monthly and yearly reports. In fact, the audit bluntly states, \\"VisitDallas' performance reports are not reliable.\\" It was revealed VisitDallas spent approximately $150 million of hotel occupancy taxes and tourism district funds between 2013 and 2017 which it is not able to verify how or how well those dollars were spent. The audit also found VisitDallas overstated \\"citywide\\" events, defined as an event that sells at least 2,500 room nights on \\"peak\\" event nights, with only 23 of the 53 events that VisitDallas claimed as qualified. In addition, the City had no way of verifying whether efforts by VisitDallas had an effect on increasing tourism. The aftermath of the audit After the release of the report, VisitDallas defended its action by stating policies were already in place addressing concerns found in the audit. On February 19, 2019, VisitDallas appeared before the Government Performance and Financial Management Committee of the Dallas City Council to respond to findings uncovered by the audit. Council Members Scott Griggs and Phillip Kingston motioned for the full council to ask the city manager to sever the contract with VisitDallas although it failed 3-2. The auditor herself has directly answered questions about the audit. In response to accusations of commingling of City and State funds, interim auditor Carol Smith stated, \\"The report issued was shared with VisitDallas,\\" Smith said in an interview, \\"and opportunities were provided for them to refute the report by providing additional facts. None were provided on that specific point.\\" Public outcry was generally divided into following categories: # Continue with VisitDallas implementing only minor changes # Fire Phillip Jones as CEO # Terminate the contract with VisitDallas ## Issue a Request for Proposal ## Create a Local Government Corporation ## Absorb VisitDallas directly into the City of Dallas at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center It was also uncovered senior executives attempted to influence the Dallas Mayoral race by using the political arm of the Texas Hotel & Lodging Association to donate $1,000 to Miguel Solis, Albert Black, Jason Villalba, Regina Montoya, and Mike Ablon to bolster opponents of Scott Griggs who was one of the most vocal critics of VisitDallas. It was discovered the Hotel PAC's largest contributor was Matthew Jones, who donated nearly $40,000 in 2017 and 2018. Resignation of senior executives Months after the release of the audit, Phillip Jones, CEO, resigned from VisitDallas followed by Matthew Jones, CFO. Sam Coats was named Interim CEO and the search for a permanent replacement was immediately started. Phillip Jones, CEO As a part of his severance agreement, Phillip Jones received a $600,000 severance package to be paid in 24 payments of $25,000 each. In a statement by VisitDallas Board Chairman, Mark Woelffer said Jones, \\"did no wrong, and the separation was mutual\\". He began working as Chief Destination Marketing Officer for the Royal Commission for Al-Ula in Saudi Arabia according to his LinkedIn profile. Matthew Jones, CFO At the time, the departure of Matthew Jones was portrayed as a resignation although it was later uncovered he was actually fired therefore not eligible to receive a severance package. In June, he opened a business consultancy along with his wife. VisitDallas under interim CEO Sam Coats On May 9, 2019, Sam Coats was announced as Interim CEO of VisitDallas. He is a former chair of DFW International Airport and has led multiple corporate turnarounds including Scholotzky's in the mid-2000s. At a press conference, he indicated his top priorities would be: # Finding a CFO # Working with the board to find a new full-time CEO # Getting VisitDallas‚Äô contract with the city renewed Before the press conference began, a group of three young black men in white shirts that read, ‚ÄúMake Dallas One City,‚Äù were asked by a VisitDallas employees to join them outside the room where a heated discussion with Frank Libra, CMO, of VisitDallas occurred afterwards leading to the discovery of a cease and desist letter which had been sent to one of the individuals, Bruce Carter, over the styling of ‚ÄúDallas‚Äù in his logo. Later that month, the Texas Attorney General ruled in a Freedom of Information Act (United States) that the City of Dallas did have to release all information regarding who on the Dallas City Council used a suite paid for by VisitDallas at the American Airlines Center mostly siding with Matthew Jones in citing it would put them at a competitive disadvantage. After some delay, the City of Dallas finally released the list of Council Members who used the suite at the American Airlines Center: * Monica Alonzo (June 6, 2017 ‚Äî Enrique Iglesias & Pitbull) * Monica Alonzo (November 12, 2017‚ÄîLatino Mix Live!) * Casey Thomas (June 3, 2016 ‚Äî R. Kelly) * Casey Thomas (May 27, 2018 ‚Äî Justin Timberlake) * Casey Thomas (July 20, 2018 ‚Äî Sam Smith) * Casey Thomas (August 17, 2018 ‚Äî WWW Big 3) * Casey Thomas (October 14, 2018 ‚Äî Bruno Mars) * Casey Thomas (December 12, 2018 ‚Äî Michelle Obama) As a result of the release of this list, it was found that Dallas City Council Member Casey Thomas failed to disclose events he attended since 2016 using the VisitDallas suite at the American Airlines Center. The resulting aftermath led to an ethics complaint filed by retired Dallas lawyer Barry Jacobs alleging the passes from VisitDallas were part of an ‚Äúongoing pattern‚Äù in which Thomas expected the gifts to continue. In a rebuttal, VisitDallas stated the suite passes shouldn‚Äôt be considered gifts that needing to be reported on financial disclosure forms even though a panel of the city‚Äôs Ethics Advisory Commission disagreed allowing the complaint to move forward. This resulted in a 6 - 1 vote by the Ethics Advisory Commission ruling Dallas City Council Member Casey Thomas violated city code by failing to disclose these tickets but promised to recuse himself from any votes related to VisitDallas. In September 2019, it was revealed VisitDallas was considering eliminating Board seats occupied by Dallas City Council Members which are appointed by Mayor Eric Johnson. In October 2019, VisitDallas appeared at a public meeting with the Dallas City Council which at times proved to be highly contentious to discuss corrective actions taken since the release of the audit. It was uncovered by Dallas City Council Members that VisitDallas was promoting events in Frisco, Texas and Plano, Texas eliciting Dallas City Council Member Omar Narvaez to forcefully state, ‚ÄúVisitDallas wasn‚Äôt put in place to promote a region,‚Äù said West Dallas‚Äô Omar Narvaez. ‚ÄúIt was put in place to promote the city of Dallas. It‚Äôs time you realized who your boss is. Your boss is the city of Dallas.‚Äù Near the end of the meeting, Far North Dallas‚Äô Dallas City Council Member Cara Mendelsohn recommended to city staff to begin preparations to find a new organization to market Dallas, either through a Request for Proposal process or by a limited government corporation similar to VisitHouston. To placate concerns held by Dallas City Council Members, Interim CEO Sam Coats revealed several sales executives were fired and the Board would be voting on reducing the number of Board Members from 55 to as few as 20. In November 2019, the Dallas City Council approved an amended agreement with VisitDallas as it enters the final year of its contract with many Council Members publicly acknowledging they did so begrudgingly. The amended contract contained the following provisions: # VisitDallas provide plans on how it plans to spend the city's money by March 30 # Provide to the Dallas City Council an annual report by December 30 # Hold an executive compensation and expense review on May 1 At this meeting, the Dallas City Council voted to redirect nearly $600,000 to arts promotion instead of VisitDallas. A few days after the vote, it was revealed in a report by The Texas Monitor that: # Several errors were uncovered on their Form 990 for fiscal year 2017 including the omission of a $275,000 annual payment to the American Airlines Center for a hospitality suite # The figures from their Form 990 showing the number of six-figure employees almost doubling between 2016 and 2017 were incorrectly reported to the Internal Revenue Service # VisitDallas also disagreed with its own reporting for its 2015 Form 990 showing the number of employees receiving a salary of $100,000 that year was 15 although it should have been 24 The future of VisitDallas In November 2019, Internal Revenue Service Form 13909 was filed against VisitDallas and forwarded to the Texas Attorney General alleging misuse of taxpayer funds, mismanagement, and excessive executive compensation. This form is used by the Internal Revenue Service determine a violation of federal tax law. The Texas Attorney General will be seeking evidence of a diversion of charitable assets or gross mismanagement resulting in a significant financial loss or other substantial harm to the charity or the public interest. In December 2019, it was announced Craig Davis was hired as the new permanent CEO of VisitDallas. He is currently CEO of VisitPITTSBURGH but also worked as an executive at hotels in Toronto, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. However, it has recently been revealed VisitPITTSBURGH had previously faced the same issues of lack of accountability and controversial executive pay packages as VisitDallas has encountered. Pennsylvania state Sen. Jim Ferlo said in a statement after the study was released, ‚ÄúThis public agency has expended millions of dollars with high executive salaries, no accountability or oversight of its performance, and little to show by way of ensuring a financially solvent taxpayer-funded convention center‚Äù. COVID-19 In March 2020, COVID-19 cases started to appear in north Texas leading to Dallas County, Texas officials declaring a local disaster resulting in a Shelter in place order by County Judge Clay Jenkins to combat the spread. This would have a direct impact on tourism and conventions in Dallas directly effecting Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) revenue which primarily funds VisitDallas. In an April 2020 Memorandum, Assistant City Manager Joey Zapata warned Mayor Eric Johnson and the Dallas City Council of: # an estimated 41.7% loss, or $47.7M, from combined revenues due to 20 cancelled events to-date, including 5 large, citywide events and decreased hotel occupancy levels # March forecasting losses of $7.2M from cancelled events at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Centerand $36.2M in HOT revenue and $4.3M in alcohol and beverage tax # predicting a three to five-year economic recovery for hotels following the COVID-19 emergency orders On May 20, 2020, VisitDallas went before the Dallas City Council to provide an update on their efforts nearly a year and half after the City's 2019 audit. During the briefing, VisitDallas CEO Craig Davis revealed they have: # cut $2 million in programming # decreased personnel costs by $2.5 million through eliminating 28 full-time and eight part-time positions and furloughed 13 ‚Äî or about 45% of staff In addition, it was revealed VisitDallas-related ethics complaints were filed in early March against: # Council Member Adam McGough is alleged to have committed bribery under Texas Penal Code Chapter 36.08 regarding hockey tickets he agreed to accept from VisitDallas in December 2018 and has even being referred to the Public Integrity Unit within the Dallas Police Department # Council Member Paula Blackmon is alleged to have a conflict of interest violation for representing both the City of Dallas and VisitDallas and a failure to file a conflict of interest form because of this # Council Member Jennifer Gates is also alleged to have a conflict of interest violation for representing both the City of Dallas and VisitDallas and a failure to file a conflict of interest form because of this and violating her fiduciary duty with the City for approving former CEO Phillip Jones' controversial $600,000 severance package # VisitDallas CEO Craig Davis is alleged to have violated Texas Penal Code Chapter 36.09 referencing a public offer in an article published by The Texas Monitor where he promised to give the Dallas City Council free tickets # VisitDallas Public Affairs Director Gary Sanchez is alleged to have violated Texas Penal Code Chapter 36.09 for offering free hockey tickets to Council Member Adam McGough References Category:1994 establishments in Texas Category:Dallas Category:Non-profit organizations based in Texas ","title":"Visitdallas"},{"id":"62527968","text":"Edwin Batista Otero, better known musically as Jenay, was a Puerto Rican reggaeton artist.

It was found in December 1913 by Raymond Weill in Wadi Hilweh (known as the City of David). It is the earliest-known evidence of a synagogue building in the region of Palestine.

It is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is The Citadel, to the southwest, and the dominant mountain in the area, Mount Daniel, rises to the west-northwest. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Yakima River. Climate Cathedral Rock is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology Cathedral Rock is an intrusive andesite volcanic complex. The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

For a brief period, it was the church of the Rev. James Martin Gray. The building now serves as the Best Temple Church of God in Christ.  Founding  Around the time of the church's founding, Newburgh was a chiefly Protestant city, and had been that way for its nearly 200 year history. With the force of the Oxford Movement, the Reformed Episcopal Church formed by Bishop George David Cummins on December 2, 1873 in opposition. Nearly a year later, a group of Episcopalian men gathered on December 8, 1874 in the parlor of the Newburgh Club. The Catholic presence in the city at this time was also increasing, perhaps giving an urgency to Cummings' new teachings. These men were Daniel T. Rogers, Walter C. Anthony and Thomas Hazard Roe of Newburgh and William James Roe II and Benjamin Franklin Clark, of New Windsor, Roe's uncle. After several more meetings, they considered the formation of a Reformed Episcopal church in Newburgh and began collecting pledges and amassing support. The men wrote to Bishop Cummings and urged him to travel to Newburgh. Cummings came to Newburgh on August 8, 1875 to preach to an interested crowd at the American Reformed Church, which the founding members had loaned for the morning. The bishop presented his revised edition of the Book of Common Prayer and explained the new tenants of his church. The next night, a larger crowd gathered in the church's basement to make pledges and hear Cummings speak.  Formation of the Church  The founders were able to obtain the chapel of the Associate Reformed Church, and the first service was held there by the Rev. Benjamin B. Leacock on August 15, 1875. He conducted a morning and evening service. The next Sunday, August 22, the Rev. William P. Sabine directed services and preached to a larger congregation. On August 25, the congregation was asked to meet at the basement of the American Reformed Church. There, the church was essentially founded officially, and the church council was elected. Their membership application was sent to the Standing Committee of the Reformed Episcopal Church that night, organized under the general statute of the State of New York. William James Roe II suggested \\"The Church of the Corner Stone\\" as the corporate name. In preparation for a new pastor, the next Sunday, September 5, the Rev. Mason Gallagher read the service, and together with Dr. J. G. Birch, they organized the first sabbath school.  The First Church Council  * Wardens: Daniel T. Rogers, Walter C. Anthony * Vestryman: William J. Roe II, James G. Graham, J. Wilson Stratton, George Middleton, Robert L. Chase, James G. Birch and Edward Haigh * Secretary and Treasurer: Benjamin F. Clark The Rev. Benjamin B. Leacock was called as the first official pastor, and he accepted on November 2, 1875. On October 23, 1875, the council had purchased a lot of land on South Street for the church. The contract for the new church building was given to Thomas Dobin at $4,969 on November 24. Donations enabled willing hands to excavate a cellar and lay a foundation. The cornerstone was laid on December 22, but no ceremony was held. The church was completed by the spring of 1876. It was built in a Gothic style, capable of holding up to 250 people At the very first Easter Sunday service, the Rev. Leacock was assisted by the Rev. Marshall B. Smith. On April 22, 1878, the Rev. Leacock resigned, and on October 1, the Rev. James Martin Gray accepted the pastorate, but resigned on November 18, 1879. Leacock filled in as minister in charge until April 3, 1880. The Rev. J. W. Fairley was his assistant, and Leacock eventually fell ill and was given a leave of absence for two years, and he resigned for good on December 2, 1883. Fairley went on, and the Rev. James Otis Denniston and the Rev. Richard Bosworth served after him. The Rev. Arthur Potts followed them. The Sabbath school flourished under the direction of an original warden. On many occasions, the church held picnics and outings outside of Newburgh. Church membership and attendance was also increasing, until the demand for the church plateaued.  Rev. James Louis Best  Many of Newburgh's Protestant churches were declining by the 1910s, as Catholic immigrants were heavily populating the city. St. George's Episcopal Church became the chief Episcopal church in Newburgh, as the others began to close in the following decades. By 1917, the church and its congregation were \\"ready to sink for the last time,\\" but it was saved by Bishop Robert Livingston Rudolph. In the 1944, the Rev. James Louis Best began preaching in Newburgh after he had moved his family there. Originally from North Carolina, Best moved to New York and became an influential Pentecostal minister. His first services in Newburgh were held in a storefront at 138 Water Street. The congregation there began to grow, and by April 1954 had moved to 80 Montgomery Street. The Best Temple Church of God in Christ was established here, but the congregation fled after Urban Renewal pushed them out in 1962. They found 111 South Street, the empty Church of the Corner- Stone, and renamed the building. Best assisted his community through Newburgh's post-Urban Renewal decline and descent into poverty, serving until his death in 2001.

Serialized in the manga magazine Weekly Young Jump from July 2011 to November 2012, the series follows a figure skater who, after moving to Hokkaido following the death of his mother, begins playing ice hockey. The series' title is derived from the ice hockey term spinorama (supinarama in Japanese), spelt as if spoken in a Hokkaido dialect. Synopsis Fifteen year old figure skater Shirakawa Rou's mother dies in a car accident the day before his qualifying performance for the Olympic Games, rendering him grief-stricken and unable to compete. Now orphaned, Shirakawa and his twin sister Haruna are forced to relocate from Tokyo to the home of their maternal grandfather in Tomakomai, Hokkaido. After an encounter with the hockey-loving Genma brothers, Shirakawa decides to join the school's ice hockey team. The series follows Shirakawa as he learns to play the sport and competes against the hockey teams of rival schools. Production Supinamarada! was creator Satoru Noda's first manga series after nearly a decade as an artist assistant. Noda has stated that the inspiration for Supinamarada! was a desire to create a story that was both about hockey and set in his home of Hokkaido. While sports manga about hockey have been produced in the past, notably My Heavenly Hockey Club and Go!! Southern Ice Hockey Club, Noda has remarked that relative to other sports, hockey is not a ubiquitous sport in the medium. Publication The series was serialized in the manga magazine Weekly Young Jump from July 14, 2011 to November 1, 2012. A one-shot spin-off chapter was later published in the February 2013 issue of the manga magazine '. The series has been collected into six tank≈çbon (bound volumes) published by Shueisha: Volume list Reception In an interview with Asahi Shimbun, Noda stated that Supinamarada! was a commercial failure during its initial serialization, and was discontinued after 15 months at the recommendation of his editor. Noda has speculated that the series' hard-to-remember title and slow initial chapters may have contributed to its inability to find an audience. The widespread acclaim for Noda's subsequent manga series Golden Kamuy has led to renewed critical recognition for Supinamarada!; the works are linked through the Supinamarada! character Toshimitsu Nihei, whose name and character design are identical to Tetsuz≈ç Nihei of Golden Kamuy.

These Chinese included both the citizens of the Republic of China and the Soviet citizens who were identified as ethnic Chinese (–ö–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ü). By the 1940s, Chinese had become almost extinct in the Russian Far East, although there were more than 200 thousands Chinese before the October Revolution in 1921. The detailed history of how the Chinese became distinct still needs to be uncovered and deciphered from the Soviet records. As local East Asians were forced to leave, Europeans were also forced to migrate to the Far East from Europe and Siberia, and eventually became dominant in the local population. Among the East Asian victims of the repression, there were at least 27,558 ethnic Chinese who were directly involved in the migration and repression. Most of them were citizens of the Republic of China., while as of 1937, there were only 26,607 ethnic Chinese Soviet citizens in the Russian Far East. Among all Chinese victims, 3,794 of them were released by the Soviet Government, 3,922 were executed, 17,175 were forced to migrate or banished, and the rest were jailed in various places including Gulags. On 30 October 2012, two monuments in memory of the victims of ethnic cleansing in the Far East were set up in Moscow and Blagoveshchensk. On 30 April, Last address decided to set up an inscribed board in memorial of Van Si Syan, a Chinese victim of the Great Purge in the Moscow Office of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Background   Repression against Chinese during the Russian Civil War  In the Russian Far East, the repression against ethnic Chinese began early before the Great Purge. As the October Revolution evoked the Russian Civil War, ethnic Chinese were discriminated against and repressed by multiple parties in the war. According to Chinese diplomatic documents, ethnic Chinese (including civilians) who were captured by the White Army were executed and their bodies displayed in public as an act of intimidation. Chinese males were often rounded up and summarily executed by being shot or bayoneted. The Red Army was arguably even worse. Undisciplined Red Army soldiers looted and burned ethnic Chinese villages and towns, raping women, killing at random, imprisoning and torturing military aged males and interning women/children. Many junior officers of the Red army regarded anyone who could not speak Russian as potential spies or foreign agents. Besides, the allied army randomly searched the belongings of the Chinese workers and if they thought anything was in suspicion, they would regard the workers as communists and kill them without interrogation. An extreme example was the case of Chinese businessmen from Changyi, Shandong, who were robbed and humiliated in Russia. This crackdown forced many ethnic Chinese to flee or return to China. A Chinese restaurant named V√°nja () in Vladivostok in 1933.  Racial tension under the New Economic Policy  The Soviet Communist Party started to carry out what was called the New Economic Policy after the civil war, which soon attracted Chinese migrants back to the Russian Far East where working forces were lacking. Although the Soviet Government also migrated 66,202 from Europe to the region, the rising number of Chinese made a tremendous impact on the local economy. By the late 1920s, the Chinese had controlled more than half commerce places and share of trade in the Far East. 48.5% of grocery retails, 22.1% of food, beverage, tobacco were sold by Chinese, 10.2% of the restaurants run by Chinese. Tension escalated as fake and low-quality goods sold by some Chinese businessmen stereotyped the Chinese as swindlers and thieves among the local Russians. On 1 June 1930, a small-scale armed conflict broke out between the two races in Leninskiy, Vladivostok initiated with Russian workers' fight against their Chinese managers, which injured 27, 3 among them permanently disabled. The fight triggered further racial conflicts. Russians in the region viewed most Chinese new-comers as non-Russian-speakers, misers, renegers and cheaters, while the Chinese regarded the Russians as addicts to violence and brutality, frequent violent threateners, unreasonable people, and fools.  Soviet governmental actions against the Chinese  House of Lee Qi Zeen in former Millionka, Vladivostok. An inner yard of Millionka in the 1920s The closure of the Chinese community led to the repugnance of the Soviet Government and the local Russians. Millionka (Áôæ‰∏áÂ∫Ñ/Áôæ‰∏áË°ó in Chinese, –ú–∏–ª–ª–∏–æ–Ω–∫–∞ in Russian) in District 18 of Vladivostok, which was densely populated by the Chinese, was free from governmental control except for taxation. The Chinese were spontaneously organized according to their origins in China, their gangs, and their religious groups, which were independent of Soviet society. Thus, the Soviet Government regarded the Chinese as a potential threat as the community could cover the Japanese espionages. Since the late 1920s, the Soviet Union tautened the control along the Sino-Soviet border with following measures: 1) stricter security check for entry into the Union; 2) taxing the outbound packages, whose worth should be less than 300 rubles, at a rate of 34%. When the Chinese were leaving the Soviet Union, they would need to pay an extra 14-ruble outbound fee and to be checked nakedly. Remittance of the Chinese was restricted. Extra taxation, including that of business license, business, income, profits, private debts, docks, poverty, school, etc., was assigned to the Chinese and their properties. The Chinese were forced to join the local workers' union, as a premise of their jobs.  Deportation during 1929-30  alt=  Early conception of the deportation  In 1926, People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs resolved to use any means to stop Chinese and Koreans migrating into Soviet territory, as they were regarded to cause danger to the Soviet Union. Koreans began to be relocated from the Far East, while measures were taken to \\"squeeze out\\" the Chinese from the border area. In 1928, Arsenyev Mikhail Mikhailovich (–ê—Ä—Å–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤ –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á), Staff Colonel of Red Army Headquarter, submitted a report to Far Eastern Commission, advising that free migration from China and Korea in the areas bordering the countries should be stopped and that the area should be filled with migrants from Siberia and Europe instead.  Soviet revenge of the Chinese occupation of KER  The Sino-Soviet conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway (KER) worsened the bilateral relation. On 19 July 1929, the Soviet Union discontinued its diplomatic relation with the Republic of China, will all diplomats recalled or expelled to their home countries. The Soviet Union suspended railway communication and demanded that all Chinese diplomats leave Soviet territory.Patrikeeff, Felix; Russian Politics in Exile: The Northeast Asian Balance of Power, 1924‚Äì1931 in: Manchurian Railways and the Opening of China: An International History Basingstoke 2002, The Soviet Government forced the Chinese to move to Northeast China. Thousands of Chinese in Irkutsk, Chita and Ulan-Ude were arrested due to reasons including breach of local orders and tax evasion. When they were to leave Russia, any Chinese to cross the border with more than 30 rubles in cash will need to pay the surplus to the authority. 1,000 rubles in cash to cross the border would make them arrested, with all the money confiscated. The Chinese were massively detained according to the Shanghai-based newspaper Shen Bao. on 24 July 1929, the newspaper said, \\"around a thousand Chinese who lived in Vladivostok were detained by the Soviet authority. They were all said to be bourgeoisie.\\" On 12 August, the newspaper stated that there were still 1,600-1,700 Chinese in jail in Vladivostok, and that each of them was provided with a piece of rye bread daily and underwent various tortures. On 26 August, the newspaper continued that the detained Chinese in Khabarovsk only had a bread soup for meal daily, among which a lot of people had hanged them due to unbearable starvation. On 14 September, the newspaper stated that another thousand of Chinese in Vladivostok were arrested, with almost no Chinese remaining in the city. On 15 September, the newspaper continued that Vladivostok had arrested more than 1,000 Chinese during 8 and 9 September and that there were estimated to be more than 7,000 Chinese in jail in the city. On 21 September, the newspaper said, \\"the Government in the Russian Far East cheated the arrested Chinese, and forced them to construct the railway between Heihe and Khabarovsk. The forced workers only had two pieces of rye bread to eat daily. If they worked with any delay, they would be whipped, making them at the edge of living and dead.\\"  Release of the arrested Chinese nationals  Although after signing the Khabarovsk Protocol, the Soviet Government released most arrested Chinese, considering that the Chinese had been severely tortured by the Soviet Government, that the confiscated possessions of the Chinese were not returned, difficult situations among the workers and businessmen, the high prices of goods, and the unaffordable living costs, the released Chinese all returned to China afterwards.The Soviet Government also began to stop Chinese crossing the border after Japan established the client state of Manchukuo in Northeast China.  Deportation during 1936-38  alt=  Plan to suppress Chinese \\"traitors and spies\\"  alt= On 21 August 1937, the deportation of Koreans, the largest ethnic group of all Asians in the Russian Far East, began being carried out. On 23 October, the Chinese were listed as a target of the purge after the Polish, the German and the Koreans, as announced by Order 693 of People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs.Nikolai Yezhov permitted secret arrests of \\"all suspicious of spies and saboteurs\\". On 10 November, the Republic of China Consulate in Chita reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Soviet was migrating 30,000 Europeans to Siberia and the Far East monthly to strengthen defence and economic construction in the region, and that to save space for the European migrants and to avoid Chinese or Korean collusion with Japan and Manchukuo, the policy to remove Koreans and Chinese was enforced. On 22 December, Nikolai Yezhov ordered Genrikh Lyushkov, Chair of People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in the Far East, to arrest all Chinese with provocation and terrorist aims with no regard to their nationality. On the following day (23rd), Yezhov published the Plan to Suppress Chinese Traitors and Spies, and order to remove any hiding places for the Chinese and other people, to search the places with care, and to arrest both tenants and landlords. Any anti-Soviet Chinese, Chinese spies, Chinese smugglers and Chinese criminals of Soviet nationality should be tried by a three-people group led by Lyushkov, anti-Soviet Chinese and Chinese spies to be suppressed. Any foreigners involved in these kinds of events should be expelled after tried. Any wanted suspicious was prohibited from living in the Far East, Chita, and Irkutsk.  Destruction of Millionka and purges against Chinese  Mikhail Iosifovich Dimentman led NKVD in Primorsky Krai to take actions to purge the Polish, the German, the Koreans and the Chinese in Vladivostok at the night of 24 December 1937. The Catholic Polish celebrating the Christmas Eve were almost all captured at that night and later sent to Central Siberia. Seven neighborhoods residing the Korean were purged for three days and two nights afterwards, with all defenders killed. Millionka, where there lived populous Chinese, was once destroyed in 1936 and rebuilt by Chinese migrants. On that night, shootouts broke out in the neighborhood, killing 7 Soviets and 434 Chinese. The Soviet Government spent 7 months to reconstruct the whole neighborhood after the conflict. Russian historian Oleg Khlevnyuk describes the night as \\"a racial massacre based on narrow Russian nationalism in the name of socialism\\". Corpses of the Chinese victims in Millionka were re-discovered on 8 June 2010. On 29 December, Primorsky Krai launched a purge against the Chinese, leading to 853 arrests according to the Krai Governmental records. The Republic of China consulates in Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk reported more than 200 and 100 Chinese arrested respectively. During 12‚Äì13 January 1938, another 20 and more Chinese were reportedly arrested in Blagoveshchensk.  Chinese reactions to escalating Soviet brutalities  On 10 January 1938, Yu Ming, Charge-D of the Chinese embassy in Moscow, Soviet Union lodge representations to the Soviet Union, urging the authority to release the Chinese. The Chinese request to meet the chief officer of the Department of the Far East of People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the following day (11 January 1938) was declined by the officer who claimed to be sick. On 13 January, some Chinese reported to Chinese consulates in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk that the detained Chinese were starving and even tortured to death, yet the NKDA reject any meeting or food donation by the Chinese consulates. On 28 January, the Chinese Consulate in Vladivostok reported to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\"how could we believe that (the Soviet authority) said the Chinese all committed espionage!\\" The Politburo published the Repressions against \\"national lines\\" in the USSR (1937-1938) (–†–µ–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –ø–æ ¬´–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è–º¬ª –≤ –°–°–°–† (1937‚Äî1938) in Russian), which extended the purges against nationalists including the Chinese and began to be carried out in February. The Soviet abuse of the Chinese hit the headline of the Central Daily News run by Chinese nationalists, China's then ruling party, on 6 February. On 14th, the Chinese Consulate in Vladivostok reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \\"the Soviet robbed everything, especially money and possessions; if they are hidden somewhere, the Chinese would be extorted by tortures, numerous people killed by such detention, which was miserable and harsh to an extreme.\\" On 17th, the Chinese Consulate in Khabarovsk protested against the tortures during interrogation, calling for Soviet release of the Chinese. On 19th, the Central Daily News again protested against the Soviet abuse of the Chinese. On 21st, Hong Kong- based Kung Sheung Daily News re-posted a Japanese coverage of the Soviet brutality against the Chinese, to express its outrage against the deeds of the Soviet Union. On 22nd, the Chinese Consulate in Khabarovsk reported another hundred of innocent Chinese arrested during the previous night by NKVD and that it was heard previously arrested Chinese were forced to work in those remote, cold areas. On 2 March, the Chinese Consulate in Vladivostok reported, \\"the Soviet authority searched for the Chinese day and night, arresting the Chinese even when they were at work. The Soviet was so aggressive that there was no space for any concession. The deeds were as brutal as the exclusion of China in 1900, during which many were drowned in the Heilongjiang River. Recalling the miserable history makes people tremble with fear.\\" After times of massive arrests, there were only more than a thousand Chinese in Vladivostok. The Soviet authority stopped the search and arrest for a month. After the Chinese sheltered by the Chinese Consulate all left the consulate, the Soviet authority restarted to search and seize the Chinese. As the Soviet had established tremendous checkpoints around the Chinese Consulate, the Chinese were unable to return to the consulate for help, which made almost all the Chinese in Vladivostok arrested. The second and third massive search-and- seizure operation arrested 2,005 and 3,082 Chinese respectively. On 7 May, the Chinese Consulate in Vladivostok reported 7 to 8 thousand Chinese in total under detention. Local prisons were filled by the Chinese, which, added by tortures during interrogation, often caused deaths.  Sino-Soviet talk on releasing arrested Chinese  Since 18 April 1938, Wang Chonghui, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the China Nationalist Government, and Ivan Trofimovich, Soviet Ambassador to China, had a 4-day talk over the detention of the Chinese nationals in the Russian Far East. Seven conclusions were made as follows: # the Soviet Union is willing to pay the expenditure of relocation of the Chinese nationals to the inner land of the Union and Xinjiang, but this should be done by the Soviet local governments stage by stage. # the Soviet Union provides the Chinese nationals with a certain duration of time, which ranges from two weeks to one month, to conclude personal issues. # the Soviet Union will only relocate the Chinese with the capability and willingness to work in the Soviet Union to her inland and she will provide convenience for the rest of the Chinese to return to China via Xinjiang. # the Soviet Union will assist the Chinese to dispose of their real estates, either for sale or for trusteeship. If there is no available trustee, the Chinese consulates can serve as the trustee, only if not massive real estates are under the trusteeship of the consulates. City authorities will send special officials to make the assistance. # the foreign affairs section of the city authorities should create a name list of Chinese for the relocation as is defined by Article 3; a copy of the list to state the time for relocation. The two documents should be submitted via diplomatic representations to the Chinese Consulate in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk for record purposes. # the Soviet Union allows the Soviet wives of the Chinese to move to China. # the Soviet Union agrees to release arrested Chinese in principal, unless the person commits high crimes. On 10 June 1938, the Soviet Politburo passed the resolution on Relocation of the Chinese in the Far East, which stopped compelling Chinese in the Russian Far East. The Chinese were then allowed to move to Xinjiang. If the Chinese person was unwilling to move to Xinjiang, he/she would be relocated to a Soviet territory except for the frontier closed and forted area in the Far East. If the Chinese person was unwilling to move to Xinjiang but he has no property in the Far East, he/she should be relocated to Kazakhstan. If the Chinese person was accused of espionage and sabotage, he/she should not be released.  Destinations of the deported Chinese   Released within the Soviet Union  = The Far East = During 13 June to 8 July 1938, NKVD released 2,853 Chinese after re-examine their profiles, as ordered by the Central Committees. Egerseld Station witnessed 5 trains carrying jailed Chinese that would be free soon. Among the trains, the last train travelled north and transported 941 Chinese to the remote area of Kur- Urmi, Khabarovsk, where the Chinese went free. = Central Asia and Europe = 1939 USSR Census showed there were more than 5,567 Chinese living the Soviet Central Asia, especially Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, most of whom were assumed to move from the Far East and East Siberia, as the Chinese population had been scarce in Central Asia during 1926‚Äì1937. According to an order issued by Nikolai Yezhov on 3 June 1938, \\"Chinese wives of the Chinese with Soviet IDs should be relocated to Kazakhstan with their spouses.\\" For September to December 1939, another 227 detained Chinese were released in Kazakhstan. 196 Chinese scholars, most of whom were engineers, were relocated to Europe. The arrival of 34 Chinese scholars at Erevan, Armenia on 16 January 1940, marked the end of the forced migration.  Returned to China via Xinjiang  Among the trains carrying Chinese to depart from Egerseld Station during 13 June to 8 July 1938, the first 4 train carried 1379, 1637, 1613, 1560 respectively and 7,130 in total to leave the Soviet Union. As the roads to Northeast China had been blocked by the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, these people traveled west along the Siberian Railway to Novosibirsk where they transfer for southward trains and returned to China via Xinjiang. Chinese consulates issued visas for their entry into Xinjiang which concerns 8,025 Chinese, among which 3,004 visa issued by the Consulate in Khabarovsk, 2,714 issued by the Consulate in Blagoveshchensk.„ÄäÊµ∑ÂèÇÂ¥¥ÊÄªÈ¢ÜÈ¶ÜÁîµÂ§ñ‰∫§ÈÉ®„Äã(1939Âπ¥1Êúà26Êó•)ÔºåÂõΩÊ∞ëÊîøÂ∫úÂ§ñ‰∫§ÈÉ®Ê°£Ê°àÔºå04/02/009/01/142 During 11 to 14 July, another 3,341 Chinese civilians left the Soviet Union via Xinjiang. During 11 to 12 October, 1,882 criminals with mild crimes were released.  Jailed and killed in the Soviet Union  There were 1,500 Chinese arrested in Chita, among which 568 were killed by tortures in the prisons. Genrikh Lyushkov claimed that there were at least 11,000 Chinese arrested by the Soviet Union after he defected to Manchukuo under Japanese control on 14 June 1938, which is agreed by historians including Nikolai Bugay and Dmitry Borisovich Fartusov. As of 1 January 1939, 3,179 Chinese were detained in Gulag and 1,794 were the Republic of China nationals. Another 2,729 Chinese were kept in normal prisons before the German invasion of Soviet in 1941, after which they were transferred to Gulag. On 1 January 1942, the number of Chinese detained in Gulag peaked at 5,192, among which 2,632 were killed, 734 missing, 1,826 later released.  Memorial  On 30 October 2012, two monuments in memory of the victims of ethnic cleansing in the Far East were set up in Moscow and Blagoveshchensk.

Its main tributaries are the Gradiz, Rio de Mel, Azores and Lez√≠ria streams. Originating in Trancoso (district of Guarda), it passes through many locations like Vila do Abade, Vila da Ponte (Sernancelhe), Escurquela, Riodades, Granjinha, T√°vora, Tabua√ßo, etc. going into the left bank of the Douro River after having traveled about 47 kilometers. It has an important reservoir, created by the Vilar Dam located between the parishes of Vilar and Fonte Arcada. This reservoir helps to normalize the Douro River flows, It is used for the production of electricity and is also recently used for the abstraction of water for public supply.  Etymology  T√°vora comes from the Latin tabula which means plank or wood for planks and by extension chestnut trees, which in the ancient world were used to make planks of excellence.FERREIRA, Pedro Augusto - TENTATIVA ETYMOLOGICO-TOPONYMICA de Investiga√ß√£o da etymologia ou proveni√™ncia dos nomes das nossas povoa√ß√µes, Segundo Volume [Em linha].

On Metacritic, another review aggregator which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 43 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\" Kimber Myers from the Los Angeles Times said that \\"though there are some well-framed shots from cinematographer Mathieu Plainfoss√©, the script from Gerry De Leon and director Ty Roberts is lifeless, covered in a layer of dust that the cast can't rouse it from.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis writing for The New York Times stated: \\"Seemingly nostalgic for a period when West Texas roughnecks settled scores with baseball bats and laid pipe with pickaxes, this lovingly made homage to avarice feels strangely limp. Instead of gushing, it trickles.\\" American film critic and historian Joe Leydon liked the movie and his review for Variety wrote: \\"Garrison strikes the perfect balance of cocksure swagger and not-so-quiet desperation while offering a credible and creditable portrayal of a man forever on the verge of plunging into the abyss because of the same instincts that initially fuel his ascent.

Is was first described to science by Oskar Carlgren in 1951. The type specimen that Carlgren used to describe the species was collected by Ed Ricketts in Puerto Escondido during his trip to the Gulf of California with John Steinbeck recounted in The Log From the Sea of Cortez. Description The column is variable in color from olive green to greenish-brown to rusty red. The column may be up to tall, with a base between and wide. The column is covered in rounded bumps called vesicles. Unlike some similar sea anemones, these vesicles are not adhesive, and thus the column of Bunodosoma californica will typically be clean, not covered with bits of shell or other detritus. The vesicles are arranged in neat longitudinal rows at the base of the column and more random, but still densely packed, further up the column. They are about the same color as the column. The oral disc is the same color as the column and may have light radial lines. There are typically 80 conical tentacles arranged in three or four rings around the oral disc, but individuals vary and may have more or fewer tentacles. The basic color of the tentacles is the same as the column, and some individuals may show rose, purple or orange tints. The tentacles are often marked with white at their base. Tentacles are slightly shorter than the width of the oral disc. Distribution Bunodosoma californicum lives on rocky bottoms from the intertidal zone to the subtidal. It can be found from the Gulf of California to Panama. Life history Bunodosoma californium is a carnivore. It uses the stinging cells, nematocysts, in its tentacles to paralyze its prey. The tentacles then push the food into the mouth in the center of the oral disc. These anemones are gonochoric, that is there are two sexes and each animal is either male or female. They reproduce by broadcast spawning, releasing eggs and sperm into the sea to achieve fertilization. Some anemones are able to reproduce by fission, in essence cloning themselves. It is unknown whether this anemone is capable of asexual fission in addition to sexual reproduction.

Built in the early 19th century, it is a rare surviving example of an industrial structure built for use in small-scale cottage industry from that period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. It is now owned by the town. Description and history The Olney Cook Aartisan Shop stands in a rural residential area of eastern Mendon, on the north side of Hartford Avenue East a short way east of its junction with Bellingham Street. It is set close to the road. It is a functionally two-story structure, with an exposed stone basement level and a wood frame main level. It has a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade has a two-panel garage door and sash windows in the granite basement walls, and three sash windows on the main level. The upper level entrance is on the right facade, accessed via stone steps. What is now Hartford Avenue East was historically the main road connecting Mendon village with towns to the east. The area where this shop stands belonged to members of the Cook family, descends of Walter Cook, one of the town's early settlers. This modest industrial shop was built sometime before 1839, when it is mentioned in a deed transferring the land from Ariel Cook to his son Olney. Members of the Cook family are known to have engaged in the shoemaking trade in the early 19th century, and Olney Cook is listed in some records as a painter. Modest industrial shops of this scale and state of preservation are particularly rare today, despite the fact that they were fairly numerous in the years prior to the erection of large-scale industrial facilities. The shop was deeded to the town in 2004; the associated Cook farmhouse and barn were demolished in the early 2000s.

Description  Adult Hydririni are narrow- to broad-winged moths. Many species exhibit an inconspicuous wing pattern of brown and ochre colours, whereas species like Choristostigma roseopennalis (Hulst, 1886) can be rather colourful. The tribe is characterised by two synapomorphies: the female genitalia have an appendix bursae on the corpus bursae (as found in Pyraustinae), and the male genitalia of most Hydririni exhibit one or more hair scale patches on the central anterior edge of the abdominal sternite 8. Apart from this, the morphology of the genitalia is rather heterogeneous: in the male genitalia, the valves are slender to broad, and the uncus and gnathos range from well-developed to reduced. The genera Choristostigma, Hydriris, Nehydriris and Rhectothyris have lobar processes with a field of long, thin hair-pencils on the dorsolateral tegumen as well as a phallus with a long caecum and a straight or hooked cornutus. In the female genitalia, two general types of signa are observed in the corpus bursae: the \\"ediacaroid\\" signum (sensu Mally et al. 2019) has the transverse axis more or less reduced, and the signum is elongate and zipper-shaped to nearly circular; the second type is formed by a circle of radiating spines. In Ommatospila, both signum types occur together. Hydririni are one of the four tribes that form the paraphyletic \\"non-euspilomeline\\" group, with the \\"euspilomeline\\" clade nested within. The \\"non-euspilomeline\\" tribes are characterised by plesiomorphic characters shared with the sister group of Spilomelinae, the Pyraustinae. These plesiomorphic characters include the absence of a longitudinal sclerotized strip on the pleural membranes of the male abdominal segment 8, a straight or concave costa of the valves and an evenly sclerotized phallus apodeme in the male genitalia, as well as the \\"ediacaroid\\" signum and an appendix bursae in the female genitalia. The morphology and chaetotaxy of Hydririni larvae has not been scientifically described.  Food plants  Ommatospila narcaeusalis, adult Rhectothyris gratiosalis, adult Syllepis hortalis, adult Recorded food plants of Hydririni larvae are predominantly Sapindaceae: Allophylus psilospermus, A. racemosus, Paullinia bracteosa, P. costaricensis, P. faginea, P. fuscescens, P. grandifolia, P. turbacensis, Serjania atrolineata, S. mexicana, S. rhombea, S. schiedeana, S. valerioi, and Urvilea ulmacea. A single case of feeding on the Fabaceae, Senna obtusifolia is recorded for a Costa Rican specimen of Lamprosema, and the young larvae of Hydriris ornatalis feed on the leaf undersides of Ipomoea batatas (Convolvulaceae) and related plants, whereas older larval instars skeletonize the leaves.  Distribution  Hydririni in its current composition contains mostly American taxa, with the majority of them described from tropical Central and South America. Lamprosema contains many Old World species that are misplaced in this genus. Systematics The tribe Hydririni was proposed in 1982 by Jo√´l Minet, who originally placed it in the crambid subfamily Glaphyriinae. Minet included only the type genus Hydriris. Minet's original placement of the tribe in Glaphyriinae is likely due to homplastic characters shared by both groups, like the spatulate scales of the hindwings and the spinose signa in the corpus bursae of the female genitalia. A phylogenetic study based on gene sequences and morphological data found the sampled specimens of Hydriris, Gonocausta, Lamprosema and Syllepis to form a monophyletic group that is the sister group to all other Spilomelinae investigated in that study. Based on morphological congruities, the authors placed four additional genera in this tribe, so that altogether eight genera, comprising 104 species, are currently placed in Hydririni: *Choristostigma Warren, 1892 (synonym Namangania Amsel, 1952) *Gonocausta Lederer, 1863 *Hydriris Meyrick, 1885 (synonyms Antiercta Amsel, 1956, Hyperectis Meyrick, 1904, Spanista Lederer, 1863) *Lamprosema H√ºbner, 1823 (misspelling Lamphosema Schaus, 1940) *Nehydriris Munroe, 1974 *Ommatospila Lederer, 1863 (synonym Thelda Walker, 1866) *Rhectothyris Warren, 1890 *Syllepis Poey, 1832 References Category:Spilomelinae Category:Moth tribes ","title":"Hydririni"},{"id":"62528361","text":"DYAB may refer to: * DYAB-AM, an AM radio station broadcasting in Cebu City, branded as Radyo Patrol * DYAB-FM, an FM radio station broadcasting in Tacloban, branded as Kaboses Radio * DYAB-TV, an TV station broadcasting in Tacloban, branded as ABS-CBN Tacloban ","title":"DYAB"},{"id":"62528422","text":"Paul Signac. Opus 217. Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones, and Tints, Portrait of M. F√©lix F√©n√©on in 1890. Museum of Modern Art, New York City. Georges Seurat. Portrait of Paul Signac. 1890. Private collection. Opus 217. Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones, and Tints, Portrait of M. F√©lix F√©n√©on in 1890 () is an 1890 oil painting by French artist Paul Signac. The Neo-impressionist work depicts the French art critic F√©lix F√©n√©on standing in front of a swirling coloured background. It has been held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York since 1991. The work is a left profile portrait of F√©n√©on, with his characteristic goatee beard, wearing a brown coat with black suit and white shirt, holding a black top hat and walking cane in his left hand, and delicately a cyclamen flower in the fingers of his outstretched right hand. The angles of F√©n√©on's head, arm, elbow, and cane, create a zigzag pattern down the right hand side of the painting, while the curved stem and petals of the flower echo the upward curve of F√©n√©on's goatee. Signac made the portrait from a pencil drawing and oil sketch of the subject, but without long sittings. Its composition may draw from an 1890 gouache portrait of Signac by Georges Seurat, in which Signac is depicted wearing a top hat and carrying a cane. The swirling patterns in the background create a kaleidoscopic colour wheel with abstract designs in eight sectors meeting at a central point, contrasting with the foreground figurative portrait of F√©n√©on and the flower. The choice of a cyclamen may be a visual pun referring to colour cycle in the background. The background may have been inspired by a Japanese wood block print of the 1860s, perhaps a kimono pattern, which was in Signac's gallery. It is probably also a reference to the aesthetic theories of Charles Henry, whose 1885 book Introduction √† une esth√©tique scientifique influenced Signac and Seurat. Henry's book on colour theory and the \\"algebra\\" of visual rhythm (which proposed a deterministic and calculable link between outer stimuli and psychic reaction) was illustrated by Signac, 1890, either Application de nouveaux instruments de pr√©cision (cercle chromatique, rapporteur et triple d√©cim√®tre esth√©tiques) a l'arch√©ologie. The exceedingly long title of the painting may be intended as a joke at Henry's scientific pretentions. All three were still in their youth: in 1890, Signac celebrated his 27th birthday, F√©n√©on turned 29, and Henry 31. By this time, the free brushstrokes of Impressionism were being succeeded by the more deliberate and scientific approach of Divisionism or Pointillism, championed by Seurat and Signac, painting with small contrasting coloured dots based on an understanding of colour theory with the intention that the pure colours would be combined in the viewer's eye and mind to create a more vivid work. Unlike many art critics, F√©n√©on was a supporter of Seurat and Signac, naming their artistic approach Neo-impressionism. The painting measures . In the lower corners are the title, \\"OP. 217\\" and the artist's signature and the date, \\"P. Signac 90\\". It was exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendents in 1891, but was not well received by most critics, who considered that the background dominated the portrait figure. Signac gave the painting to F√©n√©on, who kept it until his death in 1944. Artworks from F√©n√©on's estate were sold at the H√¥tel Drouot in 1947, and funds used by his widow to establish the Prix F√©n√©on, literary and art prizes. The painting was part donated to the Museum of Modern Art in New York by Peggy Rockefeller and David Rockefeller in 1991. References * Paul Signac. Opus 217.

The U.S. victory brought about a short-lived peace in the Rogue River Valley. Nomadic bands of Rogue River Indians had been raiding settlements in Southwest Oregon causing settlers to retaliate occasionally targeting innocent tribes. When several tribes grew tired of the retaliations they joined together under Apserkahar (nicknamed \\"Chief Jo\\"). Captain Bradford R. Alden brought a small detachment of 10 soldiers of the 4th U.S. Infantry from Fort Jones, California. Along the way Alden collected volunteers from Yreka, California and further volunteers from Oregon Territory. Before Alden could mount an effective offensive, Chief Toquahear (\\"Chief Sam\\") forced a small detachment of California volunteers to retreat and inflicting 8 casualties. In Jacksonville, Oregon Alden met up with two more companies of Oregon volunteers under General Joseph Lane. Lane then assumed command of the expedition. Lane divided the force into two battalions under Colonel John E. Ross and Alden, now using a ceremonious title of \\"Colonel\\".Cullum's Register Lane would accompany Aldon's battalion (composed of two Oregon companies under Jacob Rhodes and James P. Goodall) toward Table Rock to rendezvous with Colonel Ross at a designated point on Evans Creek.Lane's Report Four days into the expedition, Alden's battalion encountered the warriors' camp. Alden proceeded dismounted with Goodall's company while Rhodes' company made a flanking maneuver to the left. The warriors were well supplied and their camp sufficiently guarded with log breastworks. Goodall's company skirmished through thick forest while Lane personally brought reserves forward. When he arrived on the field Lane found Alden severely wounded and continued the attack himself.Rogue River Indian War The soldiers came as close as 30 yards to the warriors camp when Lane too was wounded. The battle lines held for another 3 hours until a message was delivered that the Natives wanted to cease fire and make peace.Lane's Report Even though Lane's other battalion arrived on the field, Colonel Ross was urged not to renew the fighting. Lane concealed his wounded shoulder and entered the warriors' camp and spoke with Chief Jo. He was surprised to see the warriors well armed and supplied but was informed the chiefs were tired of war. The chiefs agreed to meet again several days later at Table Rock where they signed the Treaty of Table Rock.

As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Mahjong Sisters is a tile-based japanese mahjong eroge game where players compete against three sisters with the main objective of winning the matches by getting the girls undressed. As far as gameplay goes, the game plays like other mahjong titles released at the time, as the goal of players is to take points from other players by drawing and discarding tiles until a winning hand is made. The player can choose between one of the three selectable girls at the beginning to start a match: Sayuri, Yukari and Megumi. During gameplay, players needs to claim mahjongs in order to get the girls with taking off their clothes. Failing to do so results in the girls putting a piece of their clothing back on. By meeting certain conditions such as obtaining a tenpai, the players also have the option of stripping the girls. The game is over once the players has zero points or less in their favor, unless more credits are inserted into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development and release  Mahjong Sisters was released only in arcades across Japan by Toaplan in 1986. According to former Toaplan composer Tatsuya Uemura in a 2009 interview with Japanese publication Floor 25, the code was based on the company's previous mahjong releases; Jong≈ç and Jongky≈ç. (Translation by Gamengai. ). Osamu ≈åta was responsible for the audio design, although he is not credited as such in the title. On 29 August 2018, an album containing its audio, as well as from other Toaplan titles was published exclusively in Japan by City Connection under their Clarice Disk label.  Legacy  In more recent years, the rights to Mahjong Sisters and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1948. On 14 June 1969, Pope Paul VI named him a titular archbishop and Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia.

He had a close relationship with Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner. On 19 January 1985, Pope John Paul II named him Apostolic Delegate to Southern Africa and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Lesotho. Rather than support the anti-apartheid efforts of the South African bishops led by Denis Hurley, Archbishop of Durban, Mees quoted Pope John Paul's structures against clerical participation in politics, the same words South African President P.W. Botha had quoted to the bishops: \\"It is not for the pastors of the Church to intervene directly in the political construction and organization of social life. This task forms part of the vocation of the laity acting on their own initiative with their fellow citizens.\\" Mees left South Africa in October 1987, apparently recalled to Rome, leaving in charge of the nunciature Mario Cassari, who gave the bishops' political efforts his enthusiastic endorsement.

His paintings are considered a transition from impressionism to modernism. His primary subjects were boats and harbors in which the colors and shapes on the canvas took precedence over the exactness of the objects. Hunt was active among the Southern California group of Impressionist plein air painters and a founding member of the Laguna Art Museum. Harbor of Gloucester 28x30 inch oil on canvas, ca.1934 (permanent collection, Laguna Art Museum) Early life Thomas Lorraine Hunt was born 11 February 1882 in London, Ontario, Canada, the son of the landscape artist William Powell Hunt. He was mentored in painting technique by his father who encouraged Hunt to pursue a career as an artist. Beginning at age 19, Hunt worked as a traveling salesman, then began taking landscape art seriously in 1908 at the age of 26. After marrying Blanche Levine in 1910, he and his wife immigrated to Cleveland, Ohio, USA. In Cleveland, Hunt earned a living in apartment construction as a general contractor and real estate developer, however, in the city directories he listed his occupation as artist. Career Hunt began painting in earnest around the age of 40. Following a vacation trip to Southern California with his wife and parents in 1922, Hunt sold his real estate holdings in Cleveland and moved to San Bernardino, California. Hunt continued to earn a living with real estate development projects in Hollywood and San Bernardino, but became an active figure in the artist community. He began spending considerable time with the Plein Air impressionist painters in Laguna Beach. Additionally, each summer from 1922 to 1926, he and his wife traveled back east to Gloucester, Massachusetts. In Gloucester, Hunt attended the group classes given by artist and instructor Hugh Breckenridge at his Breckenridge School of Art. Hunt's favorite subjects from both Gloucester and Southern California were landscapes of boats and harbors. In 1926, Hunt received a commission from the Elks Club of Los Angeles for a painting that would depict the end of the war with Mexico in 1848. Hunt's large 78 x 90 inch canvas, The First American Flag, illustrated the first raising of the American flag in California. The painting exemplified Hunt's \\"unique approach to painting by reducing an image to a few key elements, simplifying both color and form to create an overall patterned design.\\" Hunt moved to Laguna Beach in 1927, having built a home therewith a studio overlooking the Pacific Ocean. He became a member of the Laguna Beach Art Association and worked on the selection committee to locate a site for the Association's permanent gallery, which became the Laguna Art Museum. Hunt exhibited his works regularly during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His exhibition prizes included a 1st place at the 1928 California State Exhibition, 2nd in 1927 Laguna Beach Art Association (LBAA) exhibit, honorable mention from the San Diego Fine Arts Guild in 1933, 3rd at the 1933 LBAA exhibit, the 1933 Gertrude Streater Award for Landscape from the Pasadena Art Institute, and the 1933 Prize for Oil Painting from the San Diego Fine Arts Society. Personal life Hunt married Blanche Levina Smith (born 18 May 1871, County Down, Ireland) in 1910. They had no children. In 1937, Blanche died of a cerebral hemorrhage at their Laguna Beach home. Hunt had suffered from stomach ulcers for many years, and died at Santa Ana Hospital on 17 April 1938 after surgery for surgery for a perforated ulcer. Both Thomas and Blanche Hunt were buried at Mountain View Cemetery in San Bernardino. At Hunt's memorial service, the artist and his close friend Frank Cuprien gave the eulogy. Style and legacy Although his father was a noted landscape artist, and Hunt took some classes from Hugh Breckenridge, he is considered to be mostly self-taught. It has been speculated that Hunt was exposed to some avant-garde styles of art from the Cleveland School of Art. According to art historian Jean Stern, Hunt developed a unique style that was \\"uncommonly modernistic for the period.\\" Stern considered his paintings as a transition from impressionism to modernism through a \\"distinct and unique form of post- impressionism... characterized by bold dramatic canvasses that celebrate color.\\" William H. Gerdts described Hunt's style as using \\"forms [that] are simple, colorful, unadorned and intense... his paintings celebrate color at the expense of objective exactitude.\\" There were no solo exhibitions of Hunt's paintings during his lifetime. Following his death, the Laguna Beach Art Association held a mini-retrospective in 1938 and again in 1959. The first major collection and exhibition of paintings by Thomas Hunt was held in the fall of 2019 at the Laguna Art Museum.

Central configurations may be studied in Euclidean spaces of any dimension, although only dimensions one, two, and three are directly relevant for celestial mechanics. Examples For equal masses, one possible central configuration places the masses at the vertices of a regular polygon (forming a Klemperer rosette), a Platonic solid, or a regular polytope in higher dimensions. The centrality of the configuration follows from its symmetry. It is also possible to place an additional point, of arbitrary mass, at the center of mass of the system without changing its centrality. Placing three masses in an equilateral triangle, four at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, or more generally masses at the vertices of a regular simplex produces a central configuration even when the masses are not equal. This is the only central configuration for these masses that does not lie in a lower- dimensional subspace. Dynamics Under Newton's law of universal gravitation, bodies placed at rest in a central configuration will maintain the configuration as they collapse to a collision at their center of mass. Systems of bodies in a two-dimensional central configuration can orbit stably around their center of mass, maintaining their relative positions, with circular orbits around the center of mass or in elliptical orbits with the center of mass at a focus of the ellipse. These are the only possible stable orbits in three-dimensional space in which the system of particles always remains similar to its initial configuration. More generally, any system of particles moving under Newtonian gravitation that all collide at a single point in time and space will approximate a central configuration, in the limit as time tends to the collision time. Similarly, a system of particles that eventually all escape each other at exactly the escape velocity will approximate a central configuration in the limit as time tends to infinity. And any system of particles that move under Newtonian gravitation as if they are a rigid body must do so in a central configuration. Vortices in two- dimensional fluid dynamics, such as large storm systems on the earth's oceans, also tend to arrange themselves in central configurations. Enumeration Two central configurations are considered to be equivalent if they are similar, that is, they can be transformed into each other by some combination of rotation, translation, and scaling. With this definition of equivalence, there is only one configuration of one or two points, and it is always central. In the case of three bodies, there are three one-dimensional central configurations, found by Leonhard Euler. The finiteness of the set of three- point central configurations was shown by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in his solution to the three-body problem; Lagrange showed that there is only one non-collinear central configuration, in which the three points form the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Four points in any dimension have only finitely many central configurations. The number of configurations in this case is at least 32 and at most 8472, depending on the masses of the points. The only convex central configuration of four equal masses is a square. The only central configuration of four masses that spans three dimensions is the configuration formed by the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. For arbitrarily many points in one dimension, there are again only finitely many solutions, one for each of the linear orderings (up to reversal of the ordering) of the points on a line. For every set of point masses, and every dimension less than , there exists at least one central configuration of that dimension. For almost all -tuples of masses there are finitely many \\"Dziobek\\" configurations that span exactly dimensions. It is an unsolved problem, posed by and , whether there is always a bounded number of central configurations for five or more masses in two or more dimensions. In 1998, Stephen Smale included this problem as the sixth in his list of \\"mathematical problems for the next century\\". As partial progress, for almost all 5-tuples of masses, there are only a bounded number of two-dimensional central configurations of five points. Special classes of configurations Stacked A central configuration is said to be stacked if a subset of three or more of its masses also form a central configuration. For example this can be true for equal masses forming a square pyramid, with the four masses at the base of the pyramid also forming a central configuration, or for masses forming a triangular bipyramid, with the three masses in the central triangle of the bipyramid also forming a central configuration. Spiderweb A spiderweb central configuration is a configuration in which the masses lie at the intersection points of a collection of concentric circles with another collection of lines, meeting at the center of the circles with equal angles. The intersection points of the lines with a single circle should all be occupied by points of equal mass, but the masses may vary from circle to circle. An additional mass (which may be zero) is placed at the center of the system. For any desired number of lines, number of circles, and profile of the masses on each concentric circle of a spiderweb central configuration, it is possible to find a spiderweb central configuration matching those parameters. One can similarly obtain central configurations for families of nested Platonic solids, or more generally group-theoretic orbits of any finite subgroup of the orthogonal group. James Clerk Maxwell suggested that a special case of these configurations with one circle, a massive central body, and much lighter bodies at equally spaced points on the circle could be used to understand the motion of the rings of Saturn. used stable orbits generated from spiderweb central configurations with known mass distribution to test the accuracy of classical estimation methods for the mass distribution of galaxies. His results showed that these methods could be quite inaccurate, potentially showing that less dark matter is needed to predict galactic motion than standard theories predict.

The historic district is essentially linear, extending along Center Street between Dudley Hill and Tanyard Roads. This area was the first to be settled in the mid-17th century, and is composed mainly of civic, religious, and residential buildings dating to the 18th and 19th centuries. The district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The town of Dudley was carved out of land purchased by Joseph Dudley and William Stoughton in 1681 from the Nipmuc Indians. It was not settled until land sales in the 1720s, and was incorporated in 1732. The Dudley Hill area, where the town center is located, had a longer history as a Nipmuc settlement, and some of its land was granted for the erection of the first church in 1734. After American independence, the town center grew, with the Black Tavern (c. 1803) serving travelers, and Nichols Academy (founded 1815) located there. Dudley Hill is a linear ridge, oriented roughly north-south, along which Center Street runs. The historic district extends roughly from Dudley Hill Road in the north to Tanyard Road in the south. The northern end of the district is marked by the village cemetery, and the southern end by the Nichols campus. The most architecturally substantial building in the district is the Conant Memorial Church, built out of brick in 1890. Next to the church stands the Italianate Grange hall, built c. 1840 as a school, and the Black Tavern is across the street. Most of the residential architecture is either Federal or Greek Revival in style, although there are two examples of later 19th-century Stick style houses.

Deformation initiated in the Late Cretaceous, during which time the Sverdrup Basin began to fragment and fold in response to the counterclockwise rotation of Greenland, caused by seafloor spreading in the Canadian Arctic Rift System. Isostatic uplift was most pronounced in the Grantland Mountains and Victoria and Albert Mountains on Ellesmere Island and in the Princess Margaret Range on Axel Heiberg Island, as evidenced by the current physiography. Compression in a broad zone on Ellesmere Island resulted in the formation of the Eurekan Fold Belt. The Eurekan orogeny terminated when seafloor spreading in the Labrador Sea ceased about 33 million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. Erosion of the orogenic mountains followed, resulting in the deposition of undeformed sediment above the eroded remnants of deformed rock. At least some of the coarse clastic sediments in the Beaufort Formation were derived from the Grantland Mountains and Princess Margaret Range, suggesting that these ranges had higher elevations during the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene times.

Kazakhstan joined the World Bank in 1992 after it had gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kazakhstan has one of the fastest growing economies of all Post-Soviet states, and as a result had its classification changed from a lower-middle income state to and upper-middle income state in 2006. Because of this, Kazakhstan has begun to rely less on international financing as it had in previous decades; however, Kazakhstan still takes out loans from the world bank, primarily relating to the countries environmental issues.  History  Loss of water in the Aral Sea has left boats stranded in a newly formed desert. Upon leaving the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan showed impressive growth due to its governments willingness to accept Market liberalization and widespread banking reforms. Spearheaded by its booming oil industry, Kazakhstan was able to produce 60% of the GDP of Central Asia while it experienced an average of 10% growth rates from 1996 through 2006. The rapid growth in the economy has meant that World Bank efforts in Kazakhstan have been primarily focused on fixing issues related to the countries dire environmental issues. Specifically, early World Bank efforts had focused around replenishing the dried Aral Sea which had been reduced to nearly 10% of its original size since Soviet irrigation projects had begun in the area in the 1960s. It is in the view of the World Bank that efforts to bring water back to the North Aral Sea have largely been successful thanks to the construction of the Kok-Aral Dam which raised the water levels by 4m. Along with projects to restore the Aral Sea, early on in Kazakhstan's reemergence post-Soviet Union, the World Bank also invested in infrastructure projects. World Bank investments in infrastructure in Kazakhstan were primarily loans given to supplement ongoing projects such as the construction of an electricity grid and thousands of Kilometers of planned roads.  Current World Bank Loan Efforts   IBRD  Logo of the World Bank Currently the branch of the World Bank which provides the most funds to Kazakhstan is the IBRD. The IBRD has had 48 projects in Kazakhstan and has committed more than 8 billion USD to infrastructure, developmental, and environmental projects. The most recent major project that has been funded by the IBRD was a 1 billion dollar loan given for programmatic development policy financing. The goal of this major project, contradictory to the World Banks primary goal of environmental reform in Kazakhstan, is to help Kazakhstan reorient its economy so that it is less reliant on the Oil Industry. The loan, which was approved in 2015, is currently being repaid by Kazakhstan.  IFC  The International Finance Corporation has also had major involvement in Kazakhstan's development efforts. It has directly invested in 26 projects worth over 1 billion dollars, and has been an adviser on 5 projects totaling nearly 10 million dollars. Most recent investment from the IFC have been to financial institutions with the goal of providing support for small enterprise in remote parts of Kazakhstan. Some recent projects have also targeted Agribusiness, in order to increase the countries food production and decrease its reliance on foreign imports.  MIGA  MIGA has also given two loans to Kazakhstan, although MIGA does not participate much in the growth of Kazakhstan as its focus is primarily on lower-income developing countries. MIGA's only involvement in Kazakhstan was two loans of 190 million dollars given to the ATF Bank in Kazakhstan in the effort to alleviate stresses from the Global financial crisis. Both of these loans aimed to allow the ATF Bank to diversify its portfolio to include more small and medium enterprises.  Reception  Overall trends for the economy in Kazakhstan indicate that World Bank efforts to help the development of Kazakhstan have been a net positive for the country. This is reflected in the rising life expectancy and decreasing poverty ratio of the country. However, evidence suggests that the World Bank has failed to effectively tackle one of its main goals in Kazakhstan, protecting the environment. Although efforts to revitalize the Aral Sea have largely been successful, Carbon dioxide emission in the country have rapidly increased since the year 2000.

History The website was first launched in 2015 as a data-driven property platform attempting to solve buyers' issues with market transparency and real home values. At this time, FazWaz served just the Phuket condominium market, differentiated from other property sites by its focus on \\"accurate and up-to-date data\\". The overall aim is to create a space for everyone in the market to gather and compare detailed information, from buyers and sellers to real estate agents and property developers alike. Over the first few years of operation, FazWaz continued to gather data on additional regions in Thailand, eventually claiming to offer up-to-date data on all homes for sale and rent in Thailand, with current offerings listed as 40,447 total units. In addition to these data-driven expansions, FazWaz Group also partnered with companies like ThaiVisa, offering a custom property search portal on the ThaiVisa website powered by FazWaz technology. A network of partnerships with local developers and agencies as well as more-established property companies allowed FazWaz to develop marketing and growth strategies including native site translations in six languages, soft-launches of sister FazWaz sites with offerings in six additional countries in Southeast Asia plus United Arab Emirates, and new-brand sites like BaanThai focusing on capturing other aspects of the Thailand real estate market. In 2019 FazWaz officially announced its overseas expansion efforts focusing primarily on improving market transparency on homes in Dubai and Vietnam.

His great-grandfather was a military settler in Hokkaido and veteran of the Russo-Japanese War; Noda named the protagonist of his manga series Golden Kamuy after him. After moving to Tokyo at the age of 23, he entered the manga industry as an artist assistant. Noda was an assistant to Mitsurou Kubo for two years, and later worked under . He made his debut as a manga artist in 2003, with the one-shot Today, Kyoko's Misfortune published in '. His second one-shot story, 2006's The Goalie Only Looks in Front, won a in the Young Artist division. After working as an artist assistant for nearly a decade, Noda made his serialized manga debut in 2011 with Supinamarada!, serialized in Weekly Young Jump. After Supinamarada! was a commercial failure, Noda took a year before developing his next series, 2014's Golden Kamuy. The series would become a widespread critical and commercial success, and won the Manga Taish≈ç in 2016. Little is known about Noda's personal life. Though he maintains an online presence and is interviewed by the press about his work, he does not make public appearances; upon winning the Manga Taish≈ç in 2016, the award was accepted by his editor, with Noda delivering an audio-only acceptance speech. Style Noda draws using digital illustration exclusively. While Noda is noted for conducting in-depth research on subject material that appears in his manga, he has stated that he is not interested in maintaining strict historical accuracy in his work, citing historically inaccurate elements in Golden Kamuy such as skiing and certain firearms that were added for dramatic effect. Noda cites Keiji, Kinnikuman, and ' as among his influences. Hallmarks of his work include visual references to pop culture, and narratives that juxtapose gag comedy against violent or dramatic moments. Handsome and muscular men are a recurring element of Noda's work; he has voiced his distaste for bish≈çnen-styled manga, and has stated that he \\"draw[s] without compromise the beautiful bodies of men.\\" Works Serials *Supinamarada!, serialized in Weekly Young Jump (2011‚Äì2012) *Golden Kamuy, serialized in Weekly Young Jump (2014‚Äìpresent) One-shots * , published in ' (2003) * , published in Monthly Young Magazine (2006) Awards - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2006  The Goalie Only Looks in Front  Young Artist Division     - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2016  Golden Kamuy  Male Readers  Kono Manga ga Sugoi!    - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2016  Golden Kamuy  Grand Prize  Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize    - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2016  Golden Kamuy   Manga Taish≈ç    - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2017  Golden Kamuy  Grand Prize  Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize    - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2018  Golden Kamuy  Grand Prize  Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize    - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2018  Golden Kamuy  Best U.S. Edition of International Material‚ÄîAsia  Eisner Award   English-language translation by Viz Media  References External links * Official blog * Satoru Noda on Twitter * Category:Living people Category:Manga artists Category:Manga artists from Hokkaido Category:Manga Taish≈ç Category:Winner of Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize (Grand Prize) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Satoru Noda (artist)"},{"id":"62529411","text":"Satoru Noda may refer to: * Satoru Noda (artist), Japanese manga artist * Satoru Noda (footballer), Japanese football player ","title":"Satoru Noda"},{"id":"62529434","text":"The men's masters competition for bowling at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in Philippines was held on 6 December 2019 at Coronado Lanes, Starmall EDSA-Shaw.

Antigonid forces under Antigonus's oldest son, Demetrius, besieged the Seleucid garrison of the city of Babylon under the command of Patrocles. Prelude In 311 BC Seleucus defeated the Antigonid forces in the satrapy of Babylonia. In response Antigonus sent his son Demetrius with 15,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to retake the region.Billows, Antigonos, p.141; Diod. XIX 100, 4-5. In 310 BC, while Seleucus was campaigning in the east, Demetrius arrived at Babylon. Seleucus had left a small force in the city under the command of an admiral and geographer called Patrocles. The defenders launched guerrilla attacks at the young Antigonid's troops, and Patrocles also managed to hold off Demetrius by using the irrigation canals to flood the area.Billows, Antigonos, p.142; Diod. XIX 100, 5-6. The siege Before Demetrius arrived, Patrocles ordered an evacuation of civilians from the city, then he withdrew with his troops into Babylon‚Äôs two citadels. Demetrius capturing the city without opposition besieged the citadels. Eventually, Demetrius¬¥s soldiers manage to capture and plunder one of the citadels.Billows, Antigonos, p.142; Diod. XIX 100, 6-7; Plut. Dem, 7,2. Despite this success Antigonus ordered him back to Asia minor. In 309 BC Demetrius marched back west with the majority of his army, but left Archelaus, one of his trusted generals, with 6,000 troops and orders to take the remaining citadel. Meanwhile Seleucus, who had refused to be distracted from his eastern campaign, now returned and started to recover Babylonia.Billows, Antigonos, p.142. The aftermath Seleucus, after an extensive campaign against Archelaus, which seemed to have caused widespread devastation, reconquered the satrapy. In the end Archelaus's troops surrendered while Archelaus managed to escape to Antigonia, in Syria.Babylonian Chronicles, rev. lines 34-41.

It borders on land of the Hudson Highlands Nature Museum's Wildlife Education Center. The park features a memorial tablet dedicated to Roe's legacy in 1894.  Founding  Edward Payson Roe spent the final years of his life at his estate, Roelands, in the shadow of Storm King Mountain. His property was situated on a hill overlooking the Hudson Highlands, which he had written about countless times. Roelands was surrounded by gardens kept by Roe and backed by expansive woods. On July 19th, 1888, he began to complain of heart pain, a symptom of neuralgia. He had become aware of the condition in himself after an episode in Charleston, South Carolina on vacation there. After dinner, he read to his daughter and her friend aloud from a book of Nathaniel Hawthorne. After his wife Anna Paulina had made him a remedy fo his pains, which did not go away, a physician was called to the house. Roe suffered a sudden heart attack after feeling extreme pain for hours. He was merely 50 years old, and his death was a shock to his family and fans, who were mainly Presbyterians of the American middle class. At the time of his death, his publishers estimated that over 1,400,000 copies of his novels had been sold in the United States and abroad.  Memorial Ceremony  On Memorial Day 1894, May 30th that year, a crowd of Edward's family, friends and fans gathered beneath a boulder in the woods behind his estate. At this particular boulder he was known to rest after strenuous hikes with his friends in the surrounding woods. A bronze memorial tablet was fixed to its side to be visible from below. In attendance were the Rev. Dr. Teal of Elizabeth, New Jersey, a good friend of Roe who had begun his career as a Presbyterian minister in Cornwall, and William Hamilton Gibson, an illustrator and naturalist. Dr. Lyman Abbott spoke at the ceremony. He had assisted Roe in his earliest drafts of his most famous work, Barriers Burned Away, in 1872. The beginning of Abbott's speech tells of Roe's skills as a writer: > \\"It is of the latter aspect of his life I wish to speak for a few moments > only, in an endeavor to interpret his service to the great American people > by his pen through literature. The chief function of the imagination is to > enable us to realize actual scenes with which we are not familiar. This is > an important service. It is well that you who live in these quiet and > peaceful scenes should know what is the wretchedness of some of your fellow > beings in the slums of New York. It is well that your sympathies should be > broadened and deepened, and that you should know the sorrow, the struggle > that goes on in those less favored homes. But this is not the only function > of the imagination, nor its highest nor most important function. It gives us > enjoyment by taking us on its wings and flying with us away from lives which > otherwise would be prosaic, dull, commonplace, lives of dull routine and > drudgery. But this also is not the only nor the highest use; God has given > us imagination in order that we may have noble ideals set before us, and yet > ideals so linked to actual life that they shall become inseparable. He has > given us imagination that we may see what we may hope for, what we may > endeavor to achieve that we may be imbued with a nobler inspiration, a > higher hope, and a more loving, enduring patience and perseverance. Realism, > which uses imagination only to depict the actual, is not the highest form of > fiction. Romanticism, which uses the imagination only to depict what is for > us the unreal and impossible, is not the highest form of fiction. That > fiction is the highest which by the imagination makes real to our thought > the common affairs of life, and yet so blends them with noble ideals that we > are able to go back into life with a larger, a nobler, and a more perfect > faith.\\"  Description  The property of Roelands has been subdivided into a neighborhood. One street leading up to the park, Payson Road, was named for Roe. The park is situated on Boulevard, a somewhat preserved name for the road that traversed along the side of the original property. A sign marks the pathway up to the boulder.

At least 43 people died and more than 56 were injured. The fire started in a workshop that produced school bags and shoes. The Delhi Fire Service (DFS) received a call for help around 5:22 a.m. IST and reached the location within five minutes, but their entry to the building was prevented by the intensity of the fire and blockages to the entry points. Gas cutters had to be employed to remove the iron grilles. Thirty-five fire engines reached the location and extinguished the fire with an estimated 150 firemen involved who were able to rescue 63 people. A team from the National Disaster Response Force was deployed to assist the fire department in the rescue work. According to the police, most of the people who died were labourers who had been sleeping inside the factory. Doctors stated that deaths were due to asphyxiation caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The cause of the fire is being investigated. A preliminary investigation and eye witness claims have suggested an electrical short circuit may have been the cause. The factory was operating in a residential area and according to the local fire chief, the building lacked a proper fire license, and its use as a factory was illegal. The Delhi Police Crime Branch is investigating the case, and the owner of the building and his manager were arrested on the day of the fire. Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of Delhi, announced a compensation of to the next of kin of each person that died and for the injured. Whereas, Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, also declared a compensation of lakhs rupees for dead and thousand rupees for the injured.  Fire  The fire occurred at the plot of a luggage bag factory in the Anaj Mandi area of Central Delhi in the early morning of 8 December 2019. At least 100 people were sleeping inside the factory, of whom more than 60 were rescued. According to a report from The Hindu, the fire started in the second floor of the building and quickly spread to the third and fourth floor where the workers had been sleeping. The residents of the first two floors were able to escape, but those on the third and the fourth floors were trapped, since the fire blocked their exit and the windows had iron grilles over them. One worker made a phone call to his family from the building and stated that they were trapped by the fire and there was no way to escape. Rescue The Delhi Fire Service (DFS) received a call for help around 5:22 am IST (UTC+05:30). According to the first responders of the DFS, they had reached the location within five minutes, but their entry to the building was prevented by narrow passageways and the intensity of the fire. A total of thirty five fire engines reached the area and eventually doused the fire. A firefighter stated that the entry from the terrace was blocked by the locked doors, and that the windows had iron grilles. Gas cutters were employed to remove the grilles. The lane leading to the main entrance was congested and could only allow the entry of one fire engine at a time. A second staircase in the building was blocked with stacks of raw materials for the factory. An estimated 150 firemen were involved in the rescue operation and rescued 63 people. A National Disaster Response Force team was deployed to assist the fire department in the rescue work. The NDRF team had searched the factory for any remaining trapped victims and swept the area with gas detectors. According to the NDRF deputy commander, the third and fourth floors were filled with smoke and the levels of hazardous carbon monoxide (CO) were found to be very high. Victims 43 people died and more than 56 were injured. Two fire fighters were also injured in the incident. According to fire and police officials, the injured were shifted to Lady Hardinge Hospital, RML Hospital, LNJP Hospital, and Hindu Rao Hospital. An LNJP Hospital official stated that thirty-four people were brought dead to the hospital, with smoke inhalation being the primary cause of the death. Some of the bodies were charred. He added that among the fifteen injured, nine were under observation. According to the police, most of the dead were labourers who were sleeping inside the factory and died due to asphyxiation. Investigation The state government ordered an investigation and a report be delivered within seven days. The cause of the fire is still unknown and is being investigated. According to eye witnesses and the preliminary police investigation, an electrical short circuit was the probable cause. A police official added that a large amount of plastic stored in the premises led to smoke after the fire started. The smoke caused asphyxiation and death among the residents. The luggage bag factory was operating in a residential area. According to the local fire chief, the building lacked a proper fire licence and its use as a factory was illegal. The Delhi Police filed a case against the two owners of the factory and assigned it to the Crime Branch for investigation. The owner of the building and his manager were arrested on the same day under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter). The government of Delhi stated that Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) of the Central Government of India had \\"minted false claims\\" about the Delhi factory fire to hide the \\"corruption and inefficiency of the municipal corporation\\". It also alleged that the MoHUA was defending the illegal factory. The Delhi Fire service had stated that the factory had no fire clearance or permits to operate and was illegal, and that safety equipment was unavailable.  Aftermath  Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about the incident, calling it \\"extremely horrific\\", and announced a compensation of to next of kin of each person that died and for the injured. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of state, reached on site to make overall assessment, and announced a compensation of to next of kin of each person that died and for the injured. Manoj Tiwari, Bharatiya Janta Party state president, announced a compensation of to the next of kin of each person that died and to those who were injured. Fireman Rajesh Shukla was praised by the state Home Minister Satyendra Jain for rescuing 11 people. Shukla was an early responder and entered the building to rescue people without waiting for backup to arrive. He suffered bone injuries and was admitted to LNJP Hospital for treatment.

Xerry De Caro #13 in the town of Vallerano, province of Viterbo, region of Lazio, Italy. History In 1604, the local parish priest Don Vittore Petrucci had contracted a local painter, named Stefano Minicucci, to restore a poorly- conserved medieval fresco depicting the Virgin and Child, housed in a small road-side chapel, standing beside a small stream or rivulet (ruscello). while repainting the mouth of the Virgin, on 5 July 1604, putatively blood emerged from her lips. Alerted, the local archpriest Don Pietro Janni sent word to the bishop, Monsignor Andrea Longo, located in Civita Castellana. The word of the miracle spread, and by March of 1605, funds had been raised to begin construction of this church. The design of the church is said to have been formulated by local architects based on designs by Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola (who had died in 1573). Funds for the construction were also afforded by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, whose family had become Dukes of Parma and Piacenza, and in 1536 obtained these lands for the Duchy. The late mannerist or baroque facade stands at the end of a piazza flanked by a series of shops, with broad arched doors. In the past, these housed businesses selling and servicing pilgrims, as the church was conveniently located on a pilgrimage route to Rome. The facade is made from grey peperino stone and brick. The portal has ionic columns holding a tympanum with a 15th century marble sculpture of the Virgin and Child. The portal is flanked by Corinthian pilasters supporting a stone frieze decorated with garlands and cherubs. The lilies among the garlands were symbols of the Farnese family. The theme is repeated in the second story, with a central image of a descending dove (symbol of the holy spirit), and in the tympanum, God the Father. The second story has four coats of arms representing various donors. The roof-line of the facade is flanked by statues of Saints Peter and Paul standing atop volute scrolls. The inner oak door has a number of sculpted wood panels. The layout is that of a Latin Cross with four side chapels. The crossing has a frescoed cupola. The chapels were independently sponsored by the Paesani (first on right), Janni, Marcucci, and Farnese families. The first chapel on the right (Paesani) has an altarpiece depicting Virgin and Child with Saints by the circle of Giovanni Lanfranco. The chapel has fresco and stucco decorations. The second chapel on the right (Janni) is also decorated in a baroque fashion, with a main altarpiece of a painted 17th century crucifix. The first chapel on the left (Marcucci) has a polychrome marble altar with a canvas of The Annunciation by Girolamo Troppa. The Farnese chapel, second on the left, was dedicated to Santa Barbara. The main altarpiece, depicting the Glory of the Virgin with Saints John the Evangelist and Barbara in Ecstasy, is attributed to Giovanni Lanfranco. The crossing has a dome erected in 1620 by the architect Giovanni Maria Benazzini; the cupola was frescoed by Giuseppe Bastiani, and depicts the four evangelists. In 1993, the Madonna of Ruscello was recognized as patron of the blood donors.Comune of Vallerano, description of church.

It premiered at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 16 January 1705. There were various historical women named Arsinoe, but from the mid seventeenth-century the name became popular for fictional characters who, like the title-role of this opera, bore no relation to any of them. Introduction of Italian opera to London Clayton visited Italy and on his return staged a number of Italian singing and dancing interludes for the public at his house in York Buildings in 1703. Encouraged by the success of these ventures he decided to stage a full Italian-style opera in English. The libretto was originally written for the theatre in Bologna by :fr:Tommaso Stanzani in 1667 and performed in Venice in 1668 with music by Petronio Franceschini. (Stanzani had in fact plagiarised from La regina Floridea, an opera staged in Milan). It was translated into English by Peter Anthony Motteux, who made a number of adaptations to suit the London stage, eliminating one character entirely to reduce the number of singers required to three female and three male. He also cut the spectacular first two scenes from Stanzani‚Äôs version, as these required a male chorus, a ghost, and elaborate stage machinery that Drury Lane did not possess. It is not certain whether Clayton adapted a collection of popular Italian sings to Motteux‚Äôs libretto, or whether he composed the arias himself. In his introduction to the opera Clayton stated that he had written the work for the purpose of introducing Italian opera to London, and had had the libretto translated to this end. He drew attention to the recitative, an innovation in England, and hoped that audiences would come to approve of it. It was presented as ‚Äúan opera, after the Italian manner: all sung.‚Äù First production The production was lavish, with sets by James Thornhill. It was mostly funded by subscribers, who received tickets for the first three performances. The fourth performance was staged at court as part of Queen Anne‚Äôs fortieth birthday festivities with a special prologue written and pronounced by William Congreve. The continuo was provided by Charles Dieupart on the harpsichord and Nicola Haym on the cello. The title role was performed by Catherine Tofts. Its success was indeed largely due to her: she had been trained in Italian-style singing, and Dieupart secured the role for her with Clayton. Her involvement was decisive in ensuring that Drury Lane agreed to run the opera. The male lead role (Ormondo) was sung by the countertenor Francis Hughes. The opera ran for twenty-four nights in its first season, as well as eleven nights the following year. There were three further performances in 1707, but by that time Antonio Maria Bononcini‚Äôs Camilla had appeared on the stage, and the greatly superior musical experience it offered effectively finished Arsinoe. Critical reception and impact The music from the opera was popular. Songs in the New Opera, Call‚Äôd Arsinoe Queen of Cyprus, Compos‚Äôd by Mr Tho. Clayton, containing sixteen songs, was published by I. Walsh in April 1706. A second issue contained three additional songs, and in addition to this thirteen of the opera‚Äôs songs were published separately. On 5 October 1706 Walsh advertised a new edition, including 37 songs and the overture under the title Songs in the Opera Call‚Äôd Arsinoe Queen of Cyprus. Although the opera was successful in its time, it was derided as rubbish by later critics. One described how the opening verse began in recitative and then switched to a da capo aria which ended in the middle of a line. Another described it as ‚Äòfilled with antiquated Italian airs‚Äô which made it resemble ‚Äòthe Hospital of the old Decrepit Italian Operas.‚Äô Charles Burney said that it broke the rules of composition in every song, as well as ‚Äúthe prosody and accents of our language‚Äù. Despite its shortcomings, the success of Arsinoe showed that the London public would go to see Italian-style operas in English. In April 1705 William Congreve and John Vanbrugh put in an opera sung in Italian, with Italian singers, Gli amori di Ergasto by Jakob Greber at the Queen‚Äôs Theatre, Haymarket, but it was not popular. Only with the arrival of the first Italian castrato, Valentino Urbani, in London, in 1707, did the popularity of Italian opera really take off.

She is best known for her 25-year tenure at Vogue as a fashion editor.  Biography  The oldest of four children, Simpson was born in 1913 in Beijing (then called Peking), China, to Daniel Ammen de Menocal, a banker from an aristocratic Cuban family, and Beatrice (Crosby) de Menocal, a New York City socialite. The family lived in South America before settling in Boston, Massachusetts. Simpson married William Simpson in 1935 and moved to Locust Valley, New York; they divorced seven years later. In 1944, two years after moving to Manhattan, Simpson obtained (through a friend) a position at Harper's Bazaar, working in a photographer's studio. She was then hired to work for the magazine itself, under editor Carmel Snow. In 1947, she left Harper's Bazaar to work at Vogue, where she would remain until 1972. As a fashion editor, Simpson covered fashion shows and produced photo shoots. She collaborated with the photographer Irving Penn on many of his iconic images. She styled what would become Marilyn Monroe's final photo shoot, photographed by Bert Stern a month before her death. After leaving Vogue, Simpson worked at House & Garden magazine from 1972 until it was shuttered in 1993. In 2006, at the age of 93, Simpson became the oldest person to be featured in Vogue, when she appeared in its annual Age Issue. In 2012, at age 99, she was featured in In Vogue: The Editor's Eye, an HBO documentary about the fashion editors at Vogue. Simpson was in a 35-year relationship with art dealer Paul Magriel; they lived in separate apartments in the same Manhattan apartment building throughout their relationship and did not marry. Simpson owned a Paul Lester Weiner-designed modernist home in Amagansett, New York, built for her in 1963. She spent her later years in a retirement community in Rye, New York. She died on January 7, 2019, at the age of 105, in Rye.

In 2016, she released a memoir titled Love Had Everything to Do with It. The book details her volatile relationship which she attributed to Turner's his bipolar disorder. She told The Afro: \\"I decided to write it because it was like a cleansing and it released all of the trauma. Also, I wanted the general public to have a better outlook and perspective on where Ike was mentally and emotionally, because so often, as a nation, we turn on people who have mental health issues and define them by their behaviors rather than their condition.\\" Madison has a son, Maurion Henderson, from a previous relationship.

The spiral itself is not shown, but is visible where the circles are more dense. In differential geometry, the Tait‚ÄìKneser theorem states that, if a smooth plane curve has monotonic curvature, then the osculating circles of the curve are disjoint and nested within each other. The logarithmic spiral or the pictured Archimedean spiral provide examples of curves whose curvature is monotonic for the entire curve. This monotonicity cannot happen for a simple closed curve (by the four- vertex theorem, there are at least four vertices where the curvature reaches an extreme point) but for such curves the theorem can be applied to the arcs of the curves between its vertices. The theorem is named after Peter Tait, who published it in 1896, and Adolf Kneser, who rediscovered it and published it in 1912. Tait's proof follows simply from the properties of the evolute, the curve traced out by the centers of osculating circles. For curves with monotone curvature, the arc length along the evolute between two centers equals the difference in radii of the corresponding circles. This arc length must be greater than the straight-line distance between the same two centers, so the two circles have centers closer together than the difference of their radii, from which the theorem follows. Analogous disjointness theorems can be proved for the family of Taylor polynomials of a given smooth function, and for the osculating conics to a given smooth curve.

Masoud Soleimani was invited by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to lead a research program. Upon his arrival in the United States, he was arrested and transferred to a prison in Atlanta.  Detention in the United States  Masoud Soleimani travelled to the US where he planned to complete the final stage of his research on treating stroke patients as a visiting scholar at the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. He was arrested on landing in Chicago and prosecutors in Atlanta accused him and two of his former students of conspiring and attempting to export biological materials from the US to Iran without authorization. According to court documents, Soleimani‚Äôs former student Mahboobe Ghaedi bought the growth factors on his behalf in early 2016. At the time, Ghaedi was a researcher in laboratory medicine at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Now a principal scientist at the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Ghaedi told Nature that she purchased the proteins in part because they are cheaper and more readily available in the United States than in Iran. Ghaedi then sent the vials to another former student of Soleimani‚Äôs, Maryam Jazayeri, a biochemist in Louisville, Kentucky. Jazayeri had agreed to take the growth factors to Soleimani during her next trip to visit family in Iran. But when she tried to board her plane at the Atlanta airport in September 2016, US border agents searched her luggage and confiscated the growth factors. Jazayeri had no further contact with US law-enforcement officials until February 2018, when she was again stopped by border agents at the Atlanta airport. They asked her about the vials they had confiscated in 2016, and Jazayeri said that she had agreed to transport the growth factors to Soleimani as a favour, without knowing that this was prohibited. According to court documents, she also told the agents that the proteins were to be used for ‚Äúmedical purposes such as stem cell research, cancer research, and transplantation‚Äù. Eight months later, on 24 October 2018, a federal grand jury indicted all three scientists under seal ‚Äî or behind closed doors ‚Äî on two counts of conspiring to export goods to Iran without authorization. At the time, Soleimani was en route to the United States to take up a temporary research position at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Federal agents arrested him when he arrived in the United States on 25 October, and the government also revoked his visa. Ghaedi, a US permanent resident, and Jazayeri, a US citizen who was born in Iran, were arrested soon afterwards. The crime he was charged for would usually result in fine but in this case the imprisonment seemed to be politically motivated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any evidence that there was criminal intent here,‚Äù says Clif Burns, a lawyer at Crowell & Moring in Washington DC who specializes in national-security law, including export controls and trade sanctions.

It is one of the largest wineries in the Hawke's Bay and remains wholly New Zealand owned.  History  Marist missionaries, in order to make sacramental wine, were the first to introduce viticulture to the Hawke's Bay Region, planting the first vineyards in 1851 at the original mission station in Pakowhai. The mission moved north to Meeanee in 1858, taking its cottage with it using steam-powered traction engines, and subsequently building residence halls, a school, and St Mary's Church (built 1863). More vineyards were planted at Meeanee, and the mission recorded its first commercial sale of wines in 1870. In 1880 the mission built its seminary building at Meeanee, the two-storey ' (French, \\"the grand house\\"), and purchased a large plot of land nearby in Taradale in 1897, where more vineyards were planted. The vines were tended by travelling from Meeanee, however disastrous flooding in 1909 prompted the mission to move its operations to the Taradale location. In 1911 the wooden La Grande Maison building was sawn into 11 separate pieces and transported to its current location over two days, using traction engines. The 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake caused extensive damage to the region and the mission estate, including the loss of nine lives when the stone chapel was destroyed. The early 21st century saw Mission Estate undergo considerable expansion, mirroring the overall expansion of the New Zealand wine industry. New buildings and facilities at Mission Estate were opened in 2007, greatly increasing its wine production capacity. In 2012, Mission Estate purchased of Marlborough vineyards after the 2008 Financial Crisis forced Cape Campbell Wines, the former owner of the land, into receivership.

Chiamenti\\" () is an inactive tank battalion of the Italian Army based in Tauriano in Friuli Venezia Giulia. Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 30 September 1975 the 32nd Tank Regiment was disbanded and the next day its XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion became the 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Castel di Borgo\\", while its III Tank Battalion became the 3rd Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Galas\\" and the V Tank Battalion became the 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\". As the war flag and traditions of the 32nd Tank Regiment were assigned to the 3rd Galas the 5th Chiamenti was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the V Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had been formed by the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment on 11 November 1940 and fought in the early stages of the Western Desert Campaign and was destroyed by the British XIII Corps in the Battle of Beda Fomm on 7-8 February 1941. For its service and sacrifice the V Tank Battalion \\"M\\" was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valour, which was transferred from the flag of the 32nd Tank Regiment to the newly created flag of the 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\". For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Silver Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 5th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment Maresciallo Carlo Chiamenti, who had served in the IV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" and was killed in action on 15 April 1941 during the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia. Equipped with M60A1 Patton main battle tanks the battalion joined the Armored Brigade \\"Mameli\\", whose headquarters had been formed from the 32nd Tank Regiment's headquarters. After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the \\"Mameli\\" was the first brigade disband. On 1 April 1991 the brigade was deactivated along with some of its subordinate units, while the 3rd and 5th tank battalions, and 23rd Bersaglieri Battalion joined the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\". On 25 August 1992 the 5th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Chiamenti\\" disbanded and its personnel entered the \\"Galas\\" battalion, which entered the reformed 32nd Tank Regiment the next day.

By the late 20th century these religious congregations were in serious decline and they decided to merge their resources in a number of collective school management groupings known as trusts. The CEIST Trust was established in 2007 to carry on the education work of five religious congregations: : Daughters of Charity : Presentation Sisters : Sisters of the Christian Retreat : Sisters of Mercy : Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. Organisation CEIST CLG was incorporated in May 2007. The religious congregations appointed 16 CEIST Members - 11 religious and 5 lay. The Board of Directors has 12 members - 3 religious and 9 lay. Day-to-day management remains the responsibility of each school‚Äôs management, in accord with the Education Act 1998. The schools are supported by the trustees from the central office.

He was of Palestinian origin. His empire spanned Africa, the Middle East and Europe. He ran his empire from the Kenyan port city of Mombasa. He was shot dead by a lone gunman in Bloedstraat, Amsterdam on 3 May 2000. His sons Baktash and Ibrahim are convicted drug dealers who are currently serving jail terms in the United States.  Biography  Akasha‚Äôs father, Abdallah Ibrahim, is said to have moved to Kenya from Ethiopia or Sudan after spending most of his life in Iraq. Akasha grew up in Mombasa and not much is known about his childhood. He was mainly involved in the transport business. His company, Akasha Transporters, however, struggled in the 1980s. At one point, he was involved in the management of Kenya National Taxi Corporation. It was through his connections and experience in the transport industry that he would carve out a name for himself as the most powerful drug lord in the East African region. He mainly served as a middleman between Pakistani heroin suppliers on one side and Dutch and Yugoslav gangs on the other, with his base in Mombasa serving as a major town in the smuggling route. After he was arrested in 2016, his son Baktash, in a series of letters to judge Victor Marrero through his lawyer George Goltzer, would describe Akasha as a violent alcoholic who was feared by the whole family and was abusive to his wives.  Arrests and convictions  While his crime activities in the region went unnoticed for most of the late 1980s and early 1990s, his luck ran out in the mid-1990s. In 1997, his son Hassan was jailed in Tanzania after being convicted of smuggling mandrax. A year later, another of his sons, Yusuf Abdallah, was arrested in Kenya for sneaking in drugs in a container declared to be carrying drinking straws and bath towels. These convictions brought the otherwise unknown and media-shy Akasha to the limelight.  Death  In 2000, Akasha travelled to The Netherlands to flee from Kenya police who had issued a warrant for his arrest. He had also gone to seek medical attention for his failing health and settle a business deal with his Dutch associate. Akasha had sold a consignment of drugs to Dutch drug lord Sam Klepper who refused to pay. Klepper then turned it over to a Mounir Barsoum. Prior to travelling to The Netherlands, Akasha kidnapped the Yugoslav conduit who had connected him to Klepper and demanded $2.5 million from the Dutchman. Barsoum‚Äôs elder brother, Magdi Barsoum, had organized a meeting between Akasha and the younger Barsoum in his coffee shop in Amsterdam for which he was to act as a mediator between the two. While walking along Bloedstraat to the meeting on 3 May 2000 with his Egyptian wife Gazi Hyat, a lone gunman shot at Akasha seven times killing him on the spot.  Legacy  After his death, his sons Baktash and Ibrahim carried on with the drug trade until 2017 when they were arrested and extradited to the U.S for trial on drug trafficking charges. On 16 August 2019, Baktash was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was married three times - to Karima, Gazi Hayat and Abdurahman Musa.

Aronsohn was born in Wissek, Prussian Province of Posen (Wysoka, Poland), he moved to Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), where he co-founded the Bromberg Ship Towing Society and the M. Stadthagen Bank. He became a municipal councillor (1878‚Äì1890), member of the magistrate of Bromberg (1890‚Äì1918) and headed the Jewish community from 1881 on. He initiated the construction of the new Synagogue. Aronsohn was elected a member of the regional Parliament of the Province of Posen. In 1903 he was elected a member of the Prussian House of Representatives for the Free-minded People‚Äôs Party, he later joined the Progressive People's Party. He criticized the policy of the Prussian Settlement Commission, which bought Polish estates in the Provinces of Posen and West Prussia because this, from his point of view, provided Poles the financial means to settle in towns. In April 1914 he unsuccessfully suggested to use a restrictive clause for the government aid of home ownership in order to exclude Poles from the funding. He was a member and last president (1915-1918) of the Bromberg Chamber of Commerce. In the first decade of the 20th century he supervised a number of important infrastructural projects and controlled the municipal tax administration, gasworks, market, slaughterhouse, water tower, locks, and real estate market. He was responsible for the construction of a modern storage and industrial district at the lower Brahe (Brda). He was a member of the Riflemen‚Äôs Association, the Historical Society of the Netze District, and the German Society of Arts and Sciences. Aronsohn financed the Kaiser Wilhelm I monument and the Archer, a sculpture which he unveiled on his 60th birthday and has become one of the symbols of Bydgoszcz. From 1915 on Aronsohn worked in the administration of German- occupied Poland. Aronsohn moved to Berlin in 1918, he opposed the incorporation of Bromberg into Poland. In 1919, he became a member of the Prussian Constitutional Assembly for the German Democratic Party. Aronsohn died in 1928 in Berlin. Today the Villa Aronsohn is the seat of the Municipal Housing Administration in Bydgoszcz.

Bagan or bagang is a fishing instrument (lift net) that uses nets and lights so that it can be used for light fishing, originating from Indonesia.Genisa (1998). p. 25. Bagan is floated out to the sea to catch fishes, squids, and shrimps, and remain in the sea for several days or even months. The catch would be transported to land using other boats.  History  Bagan in Tondao lake. Earlier light fishing in the archipelago may have appeared with the emergence of acetylene lamps in the early years of the 20th century.Horridge (1981). p. 137. Bagan (bagang) was first introduced by Makassarese and Bugis people in South and Southeast Sulawesi in the 1950s. This version may have used high pressure paraffin steam lamp produced in Indonesia during that time. Then in a relatively short period of time it has been known almost throughout the Indonesian fishing area and in its development has undergone changes in shape.  Description  Bagan is made up of several components: Nets, shack (made of woven or wooden material, sometimes without roof), serok (handle net) and lights. The nets are generally 9 x 9 m wide, with 0.5 - 1 cm mesh, made of cotton or nylon yarn. These nets are fastened to a rectangular frame made of bamboo or wood. The shack (anjang- anjang) is made of bamboo/wood whose underside is 10 x 10 m, while the upper part is 9.5 x 9.5 m (for stationary bagan). At the deck there is a roller to lower and lift the net. Catching with a bagan is only done at night (light fishing), especially on the dark moon phase by using lights as fishing aids.  Types  An illustration of bagan tancap (stationary lift net) and bagan rakit (raft lift nets).  Bagan tancap (stationary lift net)  This bagan is non-movable and once installed (planted) means it is operated for the duration of the fishing season. The net would be lowered using the roller. On the dark phases of the moon, lights are turned on since sunset and placed at a distance of ¬± 1 m above the water surface. When a large number of fish have gathered, the net is lifted and the process is repeated until it gets the desired results. The catch is generally the types of small fish such as: tembang (sardinella), anchovies, japuh (rainbow sardine), selar (yellowstripe scad), petek (leiognathidae), kerong-kerong (crescent grunter), kapas-kapas (gerres filamentosus), squid, cuttlefish, etc.  Bagan rakit (raft lift nets)  A raft bagan is a lifting net that can be moved in locations where fish are predicted to be mobile. Like the stationary bagan, there is also a platform above the raft. On either side below the shack is placed a raft and bamboo as the base (foundation) of the shack as well as a floating device. An illustration of bagan perahu (boat lift nets) and bagan perahu beranjang- anjang (boat lift nets with platform).  Bagan perahu (boat lift nets)  Compared to a raft bagan, the shape of the boat bagan is simpler and lighter making it easier to move to the desired place. This boat bagan consists of two boats which are connected at the front and back by two bamboo sticks so that a square is formed as a place to hang the net.Genisa (1998). p. 27.  Bagan perahu beranjang-anjang (boat lift nets with platform)  It is similar with bagan rakit, but with two boats as the floating device. At the time of fish capture, raft bagan, boat bagan, or boat bagan with platform is anchored.  Bagan berlayar (lift nets with sail)  While the other types were towed to the sea, sailing bagan has its own rudder and sail and generally is a boat with platform. They are usually a larger version of local boats and canoes, for example those from West Sulawesi has a hull similar to Mandarese sandeq. Some of them has a large hold built with planks, loosely coupled with a stick and string. The others are beautiful with slender boards and beautiful bow and stern like a sapa (sope), while some others doesn't have the sapa's bow. A lot of them has decorated stern, gunwale, and poop deck.Horridge (1981). p. 136. The best sailing bagan has masts on each hull (it it's a catamaran) and two parallel rigging. The rigging on East Indonesian sailing bagan is nade (gunter) or lete (lateen), the ones from Java and Sulawesi has tanja rig. Majority of sailing bagang is steered using large central rudder placed vertically, only few had side (quarter) rudders, but in practice the sail has more effect than the rudders.

The album received positive reviews and includes new recordings and samples of several jazz musicians with electronic backing. Mocean Worker went on tour to support the effort in 2005. Reception Jason MacNeil of PopMatters gave the album a positive review, calling the mixture of artists and styles a \\"great success\\", while criticizing a few ideas on the release as incomplete. In Exclaim!, Joshua Ostroff wrote that Mocean Worker lived up to his personal legacy of jazz performance via his father and top billing alongside jazz greats sampled on this album. Brian Ferdman of Jambands.com wrote that the album has a \\"beautiful arc\\", with mixes of several genres of music, summing up: \\"Every disparate source, solo, and sample fits so well that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to tell which instrumentalists are live, dead, or mere by-products of Dorn‚Äôs vivid imagination. Finely crafted albums like Enter the MoWo! have become a rarity in today‚Äôs world, but Adam Dorn‚Äôs impressive effort has resulted in a superb creation than transcends the limitations of an album. Enter the Mowo! is a true work of art and a damn fine one at that.\\" The editorial staff of AllMusic Guide gave the album four out of five stars, with reviewer Joshua Glazer positively positioning the release in jazz history, with its varied references to bop and previous attempts to sample dead musicians on new compositions. All About Jazz called it his finest work with deft musicianship. A mixed review from Michael Allen Goldberg of the Miami New Times critiqued the recordings for being unoriginal. John Murph gave a mildly negative review in Jazz Times, calling the music kitschy and musty but praising specific tracks and performances.

The formation specializes as airborne forces and air assault troops, being intended to conduct assault operations from either aircraft or helicopters at a high state of readiness. History The 6th Airborne Brigade derives its traditions from the 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, whose commander was Brigadier General Stanis≈Çaw Sosabowski, today the patron of the unit. The unit's direct lineage comes directly from the 6th Infantry Division which was reformed in 1957 into the 6th Pomeranian Airborne Division, which in turn was reformed in 1986 into the 6th Pomeranian Airborne Brigade. Role The 6th Airborne Brigade serves as the Polish Army's air- mobile unit ready to conduct operations at a high state of readiness. The brigade is equipped and trained to carry out rapid landings either as paratroopers or through insertion by helicopters. In this role, the brigade can launch surprise raids to capture strategic targets such as bridges, airports and other positions deep behind enemy lines and maintain their position until being relieved by friendly ground forces. The brigade can also carry out a number of other roles if required. These include conducting the evacuation of non-military personnel from hostile environments, supporting Polish Special Forces operations, and taking part in peace keeping missions with the UN and other organisations. Structure The brigade is currently composed of five separate battalions; 1 command battalion, 3 airborne infantry battalions, and 1 logistics battalion. The command battalion provides command and control for the brigade and also provides a reconnaissance company, a company of sappers, and an anti-aircraft battery. The airborne battalions consists of: a command company, 3 rifle companies, a mortar company, a logistics company and a medical support team. The brigade's logistics battalion is tasked with supplying any material supplies needed by the brigade during an operation.

In most cases, potential prey should listen for the sound of padding paws as a clue to their presence, with a growling warning that it has become aware of the player and is preparing to attack. They will let out a pained yelp when killed.(in Japanese) BIOHAZARD CODE: Veronica Kanzenban Kaitai Shinsho. Enterbrain. p. 68.

The reason for the frequency in Dobermans being found infected was due to Chief Brian Irons' suggestion to the K9 unit that the breed be used as the police dog for the Raccoon Police Department.  Appearances   In Resident Evil series  Zombie Dog originates Capcom video game Resident Evil (1996), the first entry in the Resident Evil series of video games. In the Zombie Dog's first appearance, one jumped through a window in an attempt to kill the protagonist. They have appeared in various later games as well.  Resident Evil film series  Zombie Dog appeared in every Resident Evil film, and Resident Evil: Vendetta.  Reception  The Zombie Dog has received mixed reviews. and particularly in reference to its jump-scare introduction. GameRant wrote that it was more of a pain to deal with than actually frightening. GameRant has claimed that the dog is among the scariest monsters in Resident Evil however. Kotaku claimed that the Zombie Dog window scene in the first game is one of the greatest video games jump-scares as well as the \\"original moment in frightening PlayStation users\\". The Guardian made similar claims. Destructoid called the window scene \\"amazingly scary sequence\\".

It is one of four traditional breeds of the region, the others being the Can de Palleiro, the Guicho or Quisquelo, and the Podengo Galego. History The Perdigueiro Galego, along with a number of regional pointers such as the Old Spanish Pointer, the Portuguese Pointer, the pach√≥n navarro, the Braque Fran√ßais, descends from early Italian Braccos imported into North-West Iberia and South-West France several centuries ago, all developing into distinct types according with the preferences and requirements of local sportsmen. The Perdigueiro Galego was most commonly found in the municipalities of A Mezquita, Viana do Bolo, Ri√≥s, Laza and A Veiga in the Galician Province of Ourense. From the 1970s foreign breeds of pointer became available to Spanish hunters and numbers of the Perdigueiro Galego went into decline, this was compounded by a decline in partridge numbers throughout the Galician Massif. To prevent the extinction of the breed, the best specimens still available were located and recorded, particularly from the provinces of Ourense and Lugo. In 2001 a breed studbook was established to record pedigrees, it is managed by the . Description The Perdigueiro Galego is a medium-sized breed of pointer, it weighs between and stands between , dogs are typically larger than bitches. The breed has a short dense coat, which may be spotted or mottled bicoloured or tricoloured with any of chestnut, orange, cinnamon and black on white; solid brown, yellow or black examples are also found. Use The breed is a versatile pointing breed in that it is used to hunt, point and retrieve game once shot by the hunter. The Perdigueiro Galego is used predominantly to hunt game birds, in particular partridge, quail and woodcock, although it is also used to hunt small ground game such as hare and rabbit.

After young woman of Bulgarian-Greek and Christian origin attempted to convert to Islam to marry a Turk against the will of her family, she was detained by the US Consul at Thessaloniki. An enraged mob attempted to retrieve the woman, and murdered Moulin and Abbott when it failed to find her. A diplomatic backlash ensued, leading to displays of force and to reforms in the Ottoman Empire.  Background  In the 1820s, a number of incidents leading to the death of Christians occurred in the Ottoman Empire, notably the Constantinople massacre of 1821, marking the European opinion. The exactions of the bashi-bazouk compounded this sentiment in the following decades.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 12 On 15 June 1858, rioting in Jeddah, believed to have been instigated by a former police chief in reaction to British policy in the Red Sea, led to the massacre of 25 Christians, including the British and French consuls, members of their families, and wealthy Greek merchants,Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 17 yielding a two-day retaliation bombardment from the British frigate HMS Cyclops. The declining Ottoman Empire was also relying more and more on European investment and loans even for daily expenditure, which the European public opinion resented as it was perceived that the funds were squandered in inefficient projects and in corruption, contributing to the poor image of the Empire.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 24 Finally, the Sublime Porte was entering a period of such political instability that 1876 would become known as the \\"Year of Three Sultans\\".Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 25 At that time, a Bulgarian notable, Pericles Hajji Lazzaro, acted as US Consul in Thessaloniki (Salonika). The German consul in Thessaloniki was Sir Henry Abbott, a British subject of Orthodox Christian faith. His brothers were George Abbott and Alfred Abbott. The French consul was Jules Moulin. Moulin and Abbott had married Hajji Lazzaro's sisters, and they were thus all tied by familial links. On 3 May 1876,Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 28 a 16-year-old woman named Stephana, was abducted by several women.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 30 Stephana, from Bogdanitsa, near Gevgelija, was of Greek and Christian heritage, but had converted to Islam against the will of her family. Stephana associated with a neighbouring Turkish and Muslim family, which took her in their home and proposed to bring her to Thessaloniki in order to complete administrative paperwork that would officially enact her conversion to Islam. To do so, Ottoman law required the convert to appear before a local council and testify that they were embracing Islam freely, as a sane adult and without coercion.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 27 The Turks gave Stephana a traditional attire, comprising a full coat and a veil, and brought her to Gevgelija where she would take the train to Thessaloniki.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 31 When the train stopped at Karasuli, Stephana's mother Maria was there and recognised her daughter, whom she tried to convince not to follow through with her conversion to Islam.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 32 The train arrived at Thessaloniki in the morning of 5 May. As Stephana asked policemen to escort her to the governor's residence, her mother called for help from Christian bystanders;Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 33 as the day was a Greek holiday, a 150-strong group of Christians happened to be at the station, including George Abbott, and they attacked Stephana's companions. They seized her, removed her traditional Turkish clothes, put her in a carriage and took her to Hajji Lazzaro's residence. On the next day, a mob gathered to demand that the Consul hand over Stephana to them.  Incident  In the morning of 6 May, a crowd started assembling in front of the Governor's residence. As rumours ran wild, people grew restless, prompting the Chief of Police, Colonel Salim Bey, to call for the crowd to calm down and disperse.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 37 The authorities attempted bring calm by claiming that Stephana would be freed shortly, but as the hours passed and the Governor remained empty-handed, the crowd turned into an angry mob,Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 38 with calls for marching on the US Consulate and free Stephana by force.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 39 Around 15:00 on 6 May, the consuls of France and Germany, Abbott and Moulin, learned of the commotion in the city. They decided to go to the governor, Mehmed Refet Pasha,Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 36 either to further negotiate about the conversion of Stephana or to assess the situation on the ground. Abbott and Moulin found themselves surrounded by the mob, and taken to a building adjacent to a mosque, where they found a precarious refuge from the crowd, and the very relative protection of a handful of policemen.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 40 Abbott then wrote a letter to Hajji Lazzaro, urging him to release Stephana immediately, but the mob stopped the messenger and destroyed the letter.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 41 Seeing that the letter was ineffectual and that the authorities had no assistance forthcoming either from the artillerymen of the citadel or from the marines of the ironclad Iclaliye at anchor in the harbour, Abbott wrote a second message to his brother.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 42 Meanwhile, the British Consul, J.E. Blunt, learning of the ongoing incident, sent a message of his own to Abbott's brothers, and rushed to the scene of the incident. There, witnessing the severity of the situation, he write another message to Hajji Lazzaro, also urging him to lead Stephana to the mosque.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 43 After three quarters on an hour, the mob started breaking into the room where the consuls where surrounded, by dislodging the iron bars that protected the windows.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 44 The crowd invaded the building, broke into the room and lynched Abbott and Moulin with these very iron bars, in front of Mehmed Refet Pasha, Salim Bey and a few policemen, who were helpless in protecting the consuls.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 45 The corpses were further mutilated after the two men were killed. The Murder of Consuls in Turkey, The Illustrated London News, 17 June 1876 Soon afterwards, policemen arrived, escorting Stephana. When the rioters confirmed her identity, the crowd dispersed.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 46 The mob thus ceased to threaten the Christian quarters of the city, and allowed the Pasha to extend his protection to Hajji Lazzaro. Blunt telegraphed the news of the incident and of the murders to the British embassy in Constantinople and, warning that the local authorities did not have the necessary forces to maintain order, requested the protection of the Royal Navy. Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 47  Aftermath  The governments of Europe instrumentalised the incident to embarrass the Ottoman Empire, issuing an ultimatum demanding improvements in the security of foreigners, as well as harsh and swift punishment for those responsible. Warships deployed in the Mediterranean as a show of force to back the demands. By 14 May, the port of Thessaloniki harboured the Ottoman warships Edirne, Iclaliye, Selimiye, Sahir and Muhb√Ær-i Surure; the Greek and Vasilefs Georgios; the French Gladiateur and Ch√¢teaurenault; the British HMS Bittern and Swiftsure; the Russian Ascold; and the Italian , and well as another Italian gunboat.Torunoƒülu (2009), p. 67 The Sultan replaced Refat Pasha with Sherif Pasha as governor, and sent troops in to maintain order. They arrested 50 people, of whom six were publicly executed without a trial. Several public officers were demoted and some were sentenced to hard labour. The Ottoman Empire furthermore paid 40 000 English pound compensations to the families of the victims.

During its extant existence, the contemporary polity to the north of Rauso was Sesea. The region of Rauso could also be congruous with the Nugaal plains of northern Somalia. Laurence P. Kirwan identified it with the Danakil Desert, inhabited today by the Afar.L. P. Kirwan (1972), \\"The Christian Topography and the Kingdom of Axum\\", The Geographical Journal, 138(2), p. 174. Politics English journalist Frederick Guest Tomlins described Rauso as a Kingdom. Rauso also had an alternative toponym by the epithet of Raitnus. It used to exchange ordained religious ministers with the northern polities. A predominant religion practised during the Rauso period was Waaqism.Wayessa, Bula Sirika. \\"Toward a history of the Oromo of Wallaga in southwestern Ethiopia: an ethnoarchaeological study of ceramic technological style and tuber crop domestication.\\" (2016). During the classical era, through its contact with Hadhramaut and Himyarite traders, the Rauso kingdom had contact with Abrahamic religions too, in the form of Christianity in the former and Judaism in the latter, and some of these populations had settled and became Somalized. The pre-Rauso era is largely regarded as corresponding with Lowland East Cushite history.Tindel, Raymond D. \\"Archaeological Survey of Yemen: The First Season.\\" Current Anthropology 21.1 (1980): 101-102. It was bordered to the south by various Horner and cushitic tribal groupings such as the Northern Azanians, the Ormas, the Bazrangids, the Tunni, Gabooye and various other Lowland East Cushites.Martin, E. G. \\"MAHDISM AND HOLY WARS IN ETHIOPIA BEFORE 1600.\\" Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies. Seminar for Arabian Studies, 1974. Sometime during the latter half of the 1st millennium, Rauso was replaced by the Jabarta and Ximan civilizations.Maqrizi p 17. Concurrently, there also existed a predominantly Christian civilization called Harli towards the north in the Nugaal Valley.

During his career, he starred in Iceland where he was a three-time √örvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year and led Valur to both the national championship and the Icelandic Cup in 1980 and 1983. College career Dwyer played for Monte Vista High School in Whittier, California, then junior college basketball for Rio Hondo College, where he averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds per game in his sophomore season. He then played Division I college basketball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans men's basketball team from 1974 to 1976. In 49 games, he averaged 11.0 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. Professional career In September 1978, Dwyer joined √örvalsdeild karla club Valur as player-coach, replacing recently departed Rick Hockenos. He debuted with the team in the annual Reykjav√≠k Basketball Tournament where he scored 19 points in Valur's 100-84 victory against √ç√ær√≥ttaf√©lag Reykjav√≠kur. On October 10, he guided Valur to victory in the tournament, scoring 18 points in Valur's victory against Fram. In his √örvalsdeild debut on 14 October, Dwyer scored 19 points in a 101-89 victory against √û√≥r Akureyri. On 12 March 1979, Dwyer scored a season high 44 points in a victory against arch rivals KR. Valur lost out on the national title after losing to KR, 77-75, in the last game of the season. Following the season, where he averaged 27.3 points per game in 19 games, he was named the √örvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year. After some uncertainty of his return due to his financial demands, Dwyer eventually resigned with Valur prior to the 1979-80 season. On 17 March 1980, he helped Valur to its first national championship after scoring 28 points in the teams 100-93 victory against defending champions KR in the last game of the season. In 20 games, he averaged 29.4 points, finishing second in scoring in the league behind Trent Smock's 34.6 points per game. In the Icelandic Cup, he helped Valur to the Cup Finals by scoring 55 points against Njar√∞v√≠k in the semi- final. Valur won the hard fought game, 105-103, after Kristj√°n √Åg√∫stsson scored the game winning basket from just inside center court with 2 seconds left of the game. On 19 March, he scored 28 points in Valur's cup finals win against √çS. After the season he was named the foreign player of the year for the second consecutive season. After two seasons with Valur, Dwyer signed on in France as a player-coach before returning to his home state of California. In July 1982, Dwyer returned to Valur as a player-coach prior to the 1982‚Äì83 season which he announced would be his last. In September, he led Valur to the pre-season Reykjav√≠k Basketball Tournament title, scoring 22 points in Valur's 84-77 victory against Fram. On 21 March 1983, he led Valur to its second national championship after scoring 16 points in Valur's 88-87 victory against second-placed Keflav√≠k. The game had a controversial ending after the referee Sigur√∞ur Valur Halld√≥rsson called a three second violation on Keflav√≠k's Brad Miley as he went up for a shot where Dwyer appearently fouled him with few seconds remaining of the game. Three days later, on 24 March, Dwyer scored 9 points but fouled out in the beginning of the second half of Valur's 78-75 victory against √çR in the Icelandic cup finals. After the season he was named the √örvalsdeild Foreign Player of the Year for the third time in his career. For the season, he finished fourth in scoring, averaging 23.6 points per game.

The outstanding loans at the time stood at $2.05 billion dollars and 3.3 billion yuan.

Since 2010, China has sought to expand financial cooperation under the auspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation by setting up the bank. Russia however has shown skepticism to the bank and in general has prioritized security cooperation within the SCO rather than economic projects. Russia has alternatively suggested to China to buy a stake in the Russian led Eurasian Development Bank. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was established in 2015 and has substituted the proposed role of the SCO Development Bank to fund infrastructure projects in the region. Despite the delays, there still remains support among member states for creating the bank.

She was born in current day Lebanon in 1905. Not much is known about her early life. She married Ali Hamdon and they immigrated to Canada, settling first in Alberta, where they established a fur trading business in Fort Chipewyan. After their children were born, they moved to Edmonton, which was a much larger city with well-established schools. Hamdon had four children: Evelyn, Lavida, Helen and Sidney. By 1931, there were nearly 700 muslims living in Canada, many coming from the region of Syria and Lebanon, which was going through upheaval after the fall of the Ottoman empire. At that time, there was only one mosque in all of North America, established in 1929 in Ross, North Dakota. In the early 30s, the Muslim community in Edmonton began to discuss building a mosque. Hamdon approached the mayor to request that the city provide land for the proposed mosque, and assured him that the muslim community would be able to find the funds to complete the project. She then led the effort to raise the funds, working with a group of women to solicit donations from the Muslim community in Edmonton, Alberta and Saskatchewan. They also raised funds and gathered support from people of other faiths, and from the business community in downtown Edmonton. They raised the $5,000 needed to build the mosque, and in 1938, the Al-Rashid mosque, the first to be built in Canada, was opened. Hamdon died in Edmonton in 1988.

Coleman chose the name Caldicot after one of the cricket loving characters (played by Naunton Wayne) in Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs film The Lady Vanishes. The novel was made into a film in 2002, starring Pauline Collins, John Alderton and Peter Capaldi. It was directed by Ian Sharp. The original hardback version of the book was published by Chilton Designs in 1993. There have been three subsequent paperback versions: in 2003, 2014 and 2019. A large print edition was also released by Isis Publishing. An unabridged audio version, read by Anne Dover, was released in 2006 by Soundings. Plot summary Mr Caldicot, a self-centered martinet, dies suddenly at a cricket match. His widow finds herself liberated by his death and is beginning to live her own life when her son tells her that he is putting her into a nursing home. He claims this is ‚Äòfor her own good‚Äô but it soon becomes clear that he simply wants to sell the family home. At the nursing home, Mrs Caldicot finds herself being bullied by the male proprietor. Unwilling to allow herself to be bullied yet again, and upset by the quality of the meals (wherein cabbage plays a significant part), Mrs Caldicot decides to walk out of the home. Other residents, inspired by her stand, decide to go with her. Suddenly finding herself leading a small army of rebellious pensioners, Mrs Caldicot moves them all into a luxury hotel. The news of the rebellion attracts a good deal of media interest and Mrs Caldicot becomes a television celebrity. To raise money she sells her story to a newspaper editor (Jenkins) who treats her kindly and honestly. As a result of the bad publicity, the nursing home which Mrs Caldicot left has to close. At the end of the book Mrs Caldicot becomes the new proprietor. Characters The following characters appear in all four books in the series: *Mrs Thelma Caldicot: Long oppressed by a bullying husband, Mrs Caldicot blossoms after her husband dies and discovers strengths she never knew she had. *Phillip Jenkins: Meets Mrs Caldicot when he is editor of a Sunday newspaper.

They make enough cash to survive ‚Äì and they also make new friends. *Book 4: Mrs Caldicot's Turkish Delight: Mrs Caldicot and her colleagues lose their home as a result of a compulsory purchase order.

In the novel, trade imbalances, entrenched unemployment in Europe, pervasive inequality in the United States, and a massive default by Latin American countries creates economic and political upheaval, which Western leaders are shown incapable of addressing. A former televangelist becomes the US President in 1993 and brings in stark and disruptive economic policies. The US military withdraws from Europe and instead is redeployed to Asia to fight a civil war in the Philippines, as well as to combat drug smuggling at home. The following year in Europe, a populist personality named Olaf D. Le Rith (an anagram of Adolf Hitler) leads his Europe First Movement (EFM) to victory in European Parliament elections. He runs on an anti- American, anti-immigration and protectionist platform, and as argued in his book Europe First, he considers European integration and a Pan-European identity as necessary to solve Europe's problems. Le Rith then forces European countries to cede sovereignty to the European Economic Community which he now controls. Come 2000, the US has an unofficial unemployment rate in excess of 20%, and a level of violence akin to Lebanon or South Africa of the 1980s. In Europe, where the EFM rules with an iron fist, unemployment and inflation had largely been eliminated the continent, the over-centralised European economy was plagued with shortages and inefficiencies. Both the US and Europe have erected massive trade barriers, which undermines Japan's export-orientated economy and ultimately social fabric. The novel, written in 1987, assumed the Soviet Union and East Germany would still be in existence, that apartheid in South Africa would end violently, and that India would be teetering on breaking up. Reviewing the book in the London Review of Books, R.W. Johnson criticised some of its prognostications. The US deficit in the 1980s, while large, constituted only a tiny faction of US GNP. The authors ignored the possibilities that a deficit could be managed by currency devaluations, or that there were US interest groups with sufficient political heft to prevent a slide to protectionism.

It is the second tier overall in the entire Galway hurling championship system. The Galway Intermediate Championship was introduced in 1949 as a competition that would bridge the gap between the senior grade and the junior grade. In its current format, the Galway Intermediate Championship begins in April. The 14 participating teams are drawn into two groups of seven teams and play each other in a round-robin system. The four top-ranking teams in both groups proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match at Kenny Park in October. The winner of the Galway Intermediate Championship, as well as being presented with the Mick Sylver Cup, qualifies for the subsequent Connacht Club Championship. The competition has been won by 37 teams, 17 of which have won it more than once. Killimordaly, Mullagh and P√°draig Pearse's are the most successful teams in the tournament's history, having won it 4 times each.

She served as First Lady from 1987 until her divorce from Ben Ali in 1988. Biography Born Na√Øma Kefi, she is the daughter of Mohamad Kefi, a prominent Tunisian army general who held a high official position in the post-independence government. She met a young member of the Tunisian Army, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, during the late 1950s or 1960s, though the circumstances of their meeting remain subject to some debate. The couple married in 1964. Ben Ali's marriage to Na√Øma, the daughter of a high ranking general, immediately helped his career and eventually helped propel him to the presidency two decades later. Ben Ali, who was only a non- commissioned officer at the time, was appointed Director of Military Intelligence in 1964, shortly after his wedding. Na√Øma Ben Ali and Ben Ali had three daughters, all of whom married prominent Tunisian businessmen: Ghazoua Ben Ali, born March 8, 1963, in Le Bardo prior to their marriage, and married Slim Zarrouk. Dorsaf Ben Ali, born July 5, 1965, who is the wife of Slim Chiboub. Their youngest daughter, Cyrine Ben Ali, was born August 21, 1971. By the mid-1980s, Ben Ali, the then Director General of National Security, was having an affair with his mistress, Le√Øla Trabelssi, whom he had met in 1984, marking the beginning of the end of his marriage to Na√Øma Ben Ali. Ben Ali and Trabelssi had a daughter out of wedlock in January 1987. Na√Øma Ben Ali became First Lady of Tunisia in 1987 when Zine El Abidine Ben Ali became president. However, President Ben Ali divorced Na√Øma in 1988, after 24 years of marriage, in favor of his mistress, Le√Øla Trabelssi, who moved into the presidential palace shortly after the separation was announced. Na√Øma Ben Ali remained in Tunis following the Tunisian Revolution, which ousted her ex-husband from power.

The daughter of Marines de Queiroz and Leonardo Pereira, she is of African, Portuguese and Native Brazilian descent. Her first contact with music was accompanying her older brother on tours with his rock band when she was 12 years old, and during her high school years she was introduced to funk carioca.Pocah.com.br ‚Äì Release She officially began her career in 2012 releasing the song \\"Mulher do Poder\\", which reached over 11 million views on YouTube and was considered a landmark in the then-blooming funk ostenta√ß√£o scene. Her posterior stage name, \\"MC Pocahontas\\", came from her physical resemblance to the eponymous Disney character. As the 2010s went by, MC Pocahontas released collaborations with Naiara Azevedo and Dani Russo (\\"√ì Quem Voltou\\", which had a music video produced by KondZilla which reached over 6.9 million views), and MC Mirella (\\"Quer Mais?\\"); both collaborations were certified Double Platinum and Diamond by Pro-M√∫sica Brasil, respectively. In 2017, rapper Future used a sample of Pocahontas' voice on the song \\"Fresh Air\\" off his album Hndrxx. In early 2019 Pocahontas signed with Warner Music Group, changing her stage name to Pocah to avoid copyright infringement allegations from Disney. Her first release for the label, \\"N√£o Sou Obrigada\\", came out in April; described as an \\"ode to women's empowerment\\", it reached over 11 million views on YouTube and 35 million streamings on Spotify.

It was written by Paul Buchanan and produced by the band. \\"The Downtown Lights\\" reached No. 67 in the UK and remained in the charts for three weeks. It also reached No. 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song's music video achieved medium rotation on MTV. Reception Upon its release, Music & Media wrote: \\"Moody, slow-stepping material from the Glaswegian trio. A striking choice as a single as this is not the easiest number to programme.\\" Mick Williams of the Lennox Herald gave the song a 6 out of 10 rating and commented: \\"\\"Downtown Lights\\", while signalling the long-awaited return of Blue Nile, is a trifle disappointing as the band seem to have stood still and failed to progress since their much acclaimed debut disc. Indeed, \\"Downtown Lights\\" could be an outtake from the band's A Walk Across the Rooftops sessions, way back in '84.\\" In a review of Hats, Peter B. King of The Pittsburgh Press commented: \\"The album's grabber is \\"The Downtown Lights\\". Moving along at a stately, machine- driven uptempo, it builds inexorably with layers of synthesizers and drum programs. Buchanan summons images of cigarettes, magazine stands and forlorn figures in stairwells for his tale of longing and fulfillment in the big city.\\" Paul Robicheau of The Boston Globe wrote: \\"The group crosses dusky, percolating keyboard layers with the grey vocals of Paul Buchanan to build a subtle splendor on \\"The Downtown Lights\\" and \\"Headlights on the Parade\\".\\" David Thigpen of Rolling Stone commented: \\"Songs such as \\"The Downtown Lights\\" and \\"Saturday Night\\" have a sparse, soulful feel that blends the cool, nocturnal languor of Bryan Ferry with the mystical hues of Peter Gabriel.\\" Jason Ankeny of AllMusic stated: \\"Tracks like \\"The Downtown Lights\\" and \\"From a Late Night Train\\" are perfectly evocative of their titles: Rich in romantic atmosphere and detail, they conjure a nocturnal fantasy world lit by neon and shrouded in fog.\\" Track listing ;7\\" single #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" - 4:40 #\\"The Wires Are Down\\" - 5:40 ;12\\" and CD single #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" - 6:26 #\\"The Wires Are Down\\" - 5:40 #\\"Halfway to Paradise\\" (instrumental) - 2:03 ;12\\" single (US promo) #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" - 6:26 #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" - 4:40 #\\"The Wires Are Down\\" - 5:40 ;CD single (US promo) #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" (Album version) - 6:26 #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" (Edit version) - 4:40 ;CD single (US promo) #\\"The Downtown Lights\\" - 4:05 #\\"Headlights On the Parade\\" - 3:53 #\\"Saturday Night\\" - 4:01 Cover versions * In 1995, Scottish singer Annie Lennox released a version of the song on her second solo album Medusa. In an article she wrote for The Independent, Lennox revealed why she chose to record the song: \\"I just couldn't resist this. Landscape of sound - instrumental gorgeous melancholic drift...\\" * In 1995, British singer Rod Stewart included a version on his seventeenth studio album A Spanner in the Works. Stewart's version was produced by Trevor Horn who listed Hats as one of his favourite albums in an article by The Quietus in 2019. He stated: \\"I came to [Hats] when I was working with Rod Stewart. Suddenly from nowhere he was all \\"I've heard this song, Trevor, I fucking love it!\\" And it was \\"The Downtown Lights\\" off this album.

It was named in 2019 by Arjan Mann and Hillary C. Maddin.  History of study  The genus name is derived from the roots diabolus (\\"devil\\"), which refers to the stark red color of the latex peels used in the original study, and rota (\\"wheel\\") to refer to the English rotavator (a digger), which in turn refers to the fossorial ecology of recumbirostrans. The species name honors American paleontologist John Bolt. The taxon is represented by a single, nearly complete skeleton that was collected from the Sunspot Mine at Mazon Creek, Illinois.  Anatomy  Mann and Maddin (2019) diagnose Diabloroter by the following features: (1) long maxilla; (2) skull roof ornamented with radiating grooves; (3) circular pits on the prefrontal; and (4) a narrow and blunt snout. They differentiate it from the European Batropetes by: (1) reduced lengthening of the mid-dorsal ribs; and (2) a less robust pectoral girdle. They also differentiate it from the North American Quasicaecilia by: (1) less rounded skull; (2) reduced contribution of the nasals to the snout; and (3) more extensive lateral cheek. The holotype measures approximately 5.3 cm in length with a 0.92 cm long skull.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by the Clark Boat Company in Kent, Washington, United States from 1981 to 1982, but it is now out of production. Design The San Juan 33S is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars, a raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat may be optionally fitted with an inboard engine for docking and maneuvering. The fresh water tank has a capacity of . A galley is optional and can include a two-burner stove. A head is also optional and can be a marine type or portable. If fitted, it is located in the bow. Sleeping accommodation consists of four single settee berths, along with sail storage space. For sailing all halyards are led to the cockpit. The cockpit also has six winches, two primary, two secondary and two for the spinnaker. The mainsail features a mainsheet traveler, jiffy reefing and a reefing flattening system. The boat is also equipped with a boom vang, an internal mainsail outhaul and an optional jib headfoil (a headsail airfoil-shaped reinforcement). The standing rigging is of steel rod and there is an adjustable split backstay to shaoe the highly flexible mast. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 76.2. Operational history In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"this San Juan is designed for racing, and accommodations are somewhat austere. She is ultra light. The fractional rig allows for a larger-than-normal mainsail; the smaller foresails are easier to handle. The unusually narrow beam means that initial stability is limited, but the ballast/displacement ratio of 60 percent is very high. The designer claims that the only need for a genoa to replace the self-tending jib is in very light airs.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *C&C; 3/4 Ton *C&C; SR 33 *DB-1 *DB-2 *Hobie 33 *Tartan Ten References Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"San Juan 33S"},{"id":"62532607","text":"The Patan Buddhist caves are recently discovered rock-cut caves, near Patan, Maharashtra, in the district of Satara.

History of study  The holotype, now reposited at the Field Museum, was previously described by Godfrey (1997) as an a√Østopod, Phlegethontia longissama. Redescription of the specimen led to its identification as a new lysorophian taxon. Infernovenator is represented only by the holotype, a nearly complete skeleton. The genus name is given for the Latin infernum (\\"hell\\") to refer to the fossorial habitats of the taxon and venator (\\"hunter\\"). The species name honors paleontologist Margaret Clair Steen Brough.  Anatomy  Infernovenator is diagnosed by a unique combination of features: (1) 61 presacral vertebrae; (2) a triangular postfrontal that contacts the tabular; (3) a circumorbital series formed by the prefrontal, the postfrontal, the lacrimal, and the maxilla; and (4) an ossified septomaxilla. Features shared with the lysorophian Brachydectes and not with other recumbirostrans include: (1) postorbital absent and cheek emargination present; (2) bar-like tabular- squamosal complex; and (3) short and robust dentary.

He was a key organiser of the 1938 Dalfram dispute, when dock workers, concerned with the occupation of China, refused to load ships destined for Japan with Australian pig-iron, a raw material for munitions. He was twice imprisoned for his industrial activity. As a leader in the WWF during the introduction of containerisation, he was responsible for winning significant improvements in working conditions for those in the Australian stevedoring industry.  Early life  Roach was born in poverty in Coledale, on the South Coast of New South Wales in 1909, the third of eight children, to a coal-mining father and housewife mother. Two of his siblings died as babies. He left school at 13 to mine coal in Newcastle. With the onset of the Great Depression, Roach traveled through northern New South Wales and Queensland seeking work. In 1931, in Mackay he became a member of the Communist Party and became local branch secretary of the Unemployed Workers' Movement.  Waterside Workers' Federation  Returning to New South Wales in the mid-1930s, he joined the Newcastle Branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation (WWF) in 1934. In 1936, he moved to the South Coast Branch, which covered Port Kembla. He was elected Branch Secretary in March 1938 on a platform of agitating for significant improvements in working conditions at the Port. The branch was successful in securing the first union- controlled employment roster in an Australian port. The growing strength of the local branch was exemplified in the Dalfram dispute of November that same year. Citing the Japanese invasion of China, the union refused to load pig- iron ore aboard a ship, the Dalfram, that was destined for a munitions factory in Japan. The dispute drew the attention of the Attorney-General, Robert Menzies (future Prime Minister), who would earn the nick-name \\"Pig-Iron Bob\\" that would stand for the rest of his life for his attempts to force the union to cease the industrial action. During World War Two, Roach was able to consolidate the gains made in Port Kembla and extend these to other ports. He helped bring back the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers' Union which had split from the union in 1917. In 1942 he was elected Assistant General Secretary-Organiser. In 1949 during the miners' strike, he was held in contempt for using trade union resources to support the miners sent to gaol for six weeks. In 1951, as part of the WWF agitation over the Commonwealth Arbitration Court's considerations of adjustments to the minimum wage in Australia, Roach was found in contempt of court and spent nine and a half months in gaol.  Later life  Roach died in on 25 February 1997, three weeks after his wife.

Overview Biscochos are a small ring-shaped twice- baked cookie with a crisp texture, similar to an abadi cookie, with a dough typically containing flour, oil, sugar, orange juice, vanilla or anise extract. The cookies are often topped with either cinnamon sugar or coated with an egg wash and topped with sesame seeds. History Biscochos originated in the Sephardi Jewish community of Spain, and after the Inquisition in the 15th century, biscochos migrated with the surviving Sephardi Jews fleeing Spain to the Maghreb, the Middle East, and Turkey. With the arrival of Sephardi Jews to the United States, as well as the expulsion of Sephardim from Middle Eastern countries in 1949, and their subsequent refuge in Israel; bischochos are now more commonly found in these two countries. Preparation According to Jonathan Arogeti, who bakes biscochos at his synagogue in Atlanta, Georgia, \\"The dough needs to be rolled out pencil thin before it is twisted and made into the signature circle shape, the older generation always checks and makes sure that each strand of dough is not too thick.\\" Popularity Biscochos are popular among those in the Sephardi Jewish community, and are most frequently consumed during Hanukkah and Purim, among other Jewish holidays. Popularity in the United States Biscochos de huevo are prepared by Sephardic Jewish Americans for special occasions and holidays. Congregants of the Or VeShalom Congregation, a Sephardi synagogue in Atlanta, Georgia, prepare biscochos for the synagogue's \\"Hanukkah Bazaar\\", an annual event which has been hosted by the synagogue since 1972. The event celebrates Hanukkah and offers various Sephardi cookies, pastries and other baked goods baked by their congregation. Or VeShalom's variant of this cookie is topped with cinnamon sugar.

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus is placed in the subfamily Lycopodioideae. Some sources do not recognize the genus, sinking it into Lycopodium. Pseudolycopodium densum is native to Australia, the North Island of New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is a spore- bearing vascular plant and grows up to a metre high. It is found in a wide variety of situations, often in high rainfall areas on sandy soils. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1807 by Jacques Labillardi√®re, as Lycopodium densum. However, the name had already been used for a different species, so this name is illegitimate. Hence when Werner Rothmaler in 1944 placed the species in the genus Lepidotis as Lepidotis densa, this was the first legitimate use of the epithet. In 1983, Josef Holub placed the species in his genus Pseudolycopodium. This placement is accepted in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), and by the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World .

Many of these traditions vary by country or region, while others are universal and practiced in a virtually ubiquitous manner across the world. Traditions associated with the Christmas holiday are diverse in their origins and nature, with some traditions comprising an exclusively Christian religious character with origins from within the religion, while others have been described as more cultural or secular in nature and have originated from outside the realm of Christian influence. Christmas traditions have also changed and evolved significantly in the centuries since Christmas was first instituted as a holiday, with celebrations often taking on an entirely different quality or atmosphere depending on the time period and geographical region.  Church attendance  Christmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a holy day of obligation in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion. Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost. As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of people at Christmas services in 2015.  Decorations  Neapolitan presepe or presepio, or Nativity scene. Local cr√®ches are renowned for their ornate decorations and symbolic figurines, often mirroring daily life. The practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history. In the 15th century, it was recorded that in London it was the custom at Christmas for every house and all the parish churches to be \\"decked with holm, ivy, bays, and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green\\".Miles, Clement A, Christmas customs and traditions, Courier Dover Publications, 1976, , p. 272. The heart-shaped leaves of ivy were said to symbolize the coming to earth of Jesus, while holly was seen as protection against pagans and witches, its thorns and red berries held to represent the Crown of Thorns worn by Jesus at the crucifixion and the blood he shed.Heller, Ruth, Christmas: Its Carols, Customs & Legends, Alfred Publishing (1985), , p. 12. Clifton Mill in Clifton, Ohio is the site of this Christmas display with over 3.5 million lights. Nativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe.Collins, Ace, Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas, Zondervan, (2003), p.47. Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets ‚Äì renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful Krak√≥w szopka in Poland,Internet Archive Susan Topp Weber, Nativities of the World, Gibbs Smith, 2013 which imitate Krak√≥w's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian presepi (Neapolitan, Genoese and Bolognese),Bershad, David; Carolina Mangone, The Christian Travelers Guide to Italy, Zondervan, 2001. or the Proven√ßal cr√®ches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called santons. In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static cr√®ches.Seaburg, Carl, Celebrating Christmas: An Anthology, iUniverse, 2003.Bowler, Gerry, The World Encyclopedia of Christmas, Random House LLC, 2012. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children.Collins p. 83. In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom. The traditional colors of Christmas decorations are red, green, and gold. Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion, while green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter, and gold is the first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three gifts of the Magi, symbolizing royalty. The official White House Christmas tree for 1962, displayed in the Entrance Hall and presented by John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie. The Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer. In the United States, these \\"German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees.\\" When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by The School Journal in 1897. Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus. The Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship; according to eighth-century biographer √Üddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634‚Äì709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the Trinity. The English language phrase \\"Christmas tree\\" is first recorded in 1835Harper, Douglas, Christ , Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001. and represents an importation from the German language.van Renterghem, Tony. When Santa was a shaman. St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 1995. . From Germany the custom was introduced to Britain, first via Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, and then more successfully by Prince Albert during the reign of Queen Victoria. By 1841 the Christmas tree had become even more widespread throughout Britain.Lejeune, Marie Claire. Compendium of symbolic and ritual plants in Europe, p.550. University of Michigan . By the 1870s, people in the United States had adopted the custom of putting up a Christmas tree.Shoemaker, Alfred Lewis. (1959) Christmas in Pennsylvania: a folk-cultural study. Edition 40. pp. 52, 53. Stackpole Books 1999. . Christmas trees may be decorated with lights and ornaments. On Christmas, the Christ Candle in the center of the Advent wreath is traditionally lit in many church services. Since the 16th century, the poinsettia, a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with Christmas carrying the Christian symbolism of the Star of Bethlehem; in that country it is known in Spanish as the Flower of the Holy Night. Other popular holiday plants include holly, mistletoe, red amaryllis, and Christmas cactus. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with garlands and evergreen foliage. The display of Christmas villages has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated sleighs, snowmen, and other Christmas figures. Mistletoe features prominently in European myth and folklore (for example the legend of Baldr), it is an evergreen parasitic plant which grows on trees, especially apple and poplar, and turns golden when it is dried. It is customary to hang a sprig of mistletoe in the house at Christmas, and anyone standing underneath it may be kissed. Mistletoe has sticky white berries, one of which was traditionally removed whenever someone was kissed under it. This is probably a fertility ritual. The mistletoe berry juice resembles semen. Outdoor Christmas decoration and lighting Other traditional decorations include bells, candles, candy canes, stockings, wreaths, and angels. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an evergreen, make up Christmas wreaths and are designed to prepare Christians for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world. Christmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played from speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places.Murray, Brian. \\"Christmas lights and community building in America,\\" History Matters, Spring 2006. It is common in many parts of the world for town squares and consumer shopping areas to sponsor and display decorations. Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on Twelfth Night.  Nativity play  Children reenact a Nativity play in Oklahoma. For the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in A.D. 1223. In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sung Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus. Each year, this grew larger and people travelled from afar to see Francis' depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music. Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres. In France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.  Music and carols  Christmas carolers in Jersey The earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome. Latin hymns such as \\"Veni redemptor gentium\\", written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. \\"Corde natus ex Parentis\\" (\\"Of the Father's love begotten\\") by the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.Miles, Clement, Christmas customs and traditions, Courier Dover Publications, 1976, , p. 32. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \\"Sequence\\" or \\"Prose\\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol. By the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of Francis of Assisi, a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.Miles, pp. 31‚Äì37. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, a Shropshire chaplain, who lists twenty-five \\"caroles of Cristemas\\", probably sung by groups of wassailers, who went from house to house.Miles, pp. 47‚Äì48. Child singers in Bucharest, 1841 The songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as \\"harvest tide\\" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like \\"Personent hodie\\", \\"Good King Wenceslas\\", and \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. \\"Adeste Fideles\\" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century. Singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the Protestant Reformation in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like Martin Luther, wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th- century English reformer Charles Wesley understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the Great Awakening in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled \\"Hark! How All the Welkin Rings\\", later renamed \\"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing\\". Felix Mendelssohn wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed \\"Silent Night\\" for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. William Sandys' Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.Richard Michael Kelly. A Christmas Carol, Broadview Press, 2003, p. 10. . Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. \\"Deck the Halls\\" dates from 1784, and the American \\"Jingle Bells\\" was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music. John Rutter has composed many carols including \\"All Bells in Paradise\\", \\"Angels' Carol\\", \\"Candlelight Carol\\", \\"Donkey Carol\\", \\"Jesus Child\\", \\"Shepherd's Pipe Carol\\" and \\"Star Carol\\".  Traditional cuisine  Christmas pudding cooked on Stir-up Sunday, the Sunday before the beginning of the Advent season A special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as Sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, fruit cake and Yule log cake.Broomfield, Andrea (2007), Food and Cooking in Victorian England: A History, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, pp. 149‚Äì150.Muir, Frank (1977), Christmas customs & traditions, Taplinger Pub. Co., 1977, p. 58. Christmas table in Serbia In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Sweden it is common with a special variety of sm√∂rg√•sbord, where ham, meatballs and herring play a prominent role. In Germany, France, and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham, and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world. The Maltese traditionally serve Imbuljuta tal-Qastan, a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after Midnight Mass and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread potica, b√ªche de No√´l in France, panettone in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German stollen, marzipan cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. Eggnog is a sweetened dairy-based beverage traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture). Spirits such as brandy, rum or bourbon are often added. The finished serving is often garnished with a sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.  Cards  A 1907 Christmas card with Santa and some of his reindeer Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads \\"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\\", much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843.\\"Christmas card sold for record price\\" , BBC News. Retrieved October 28, 2011. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards. Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative, with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem, or a white dove, which can represent both the Holy Spirit and Peace on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more secular and can depict Christmas traditions, mythical figures such as Santa Claus, objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter. There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in idealized 19th-century streetscapes. Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or Biblical verse; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive \\"Season's greetings\\". Christmas stamp released in the United States in 1982, featuring a painting by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo  Commemorative stamps  A number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.  Gift giving  Christmas gifts under a Christmas tree The exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi. The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian \\"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event\\", because it was the Biblical Magi, \\"together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.\\"  Gift-bearing figures  Christmas gift-bringers in Europe Saint Nicholas, known as Sinterklaas in the Netherlands, is considered by many to be the original Santa Claus A number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), P√®re No√´l, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus. The best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch Sinterklaas, which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th- century Greek bishop of Myra, a city in the Roman province of Lycia, whose ruins are from modern Demre in southwest Turkey. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.Forbes, Bruce David, Christmas: a candid history, University of California Press, 2007, , pp. 68‚Äì79. Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the Reformation in 16th‚Äì17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or Christkindl, corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve. The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including Washington Irving and the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast (1840‚Äì1902). Following the American Revolutionary War, some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non- English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of New Amsterdam and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas. In 1809, the New-York Historical Society convened and retroactively named Sancte Claus the patron saint of Nieuw Amsterdam, the Dutch name for New York City.John Steele Gordon, The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653‚Äì2000 (Scribner), 1999. At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes. However, as new artists took over, Santa Claus developed more secular attire.Forbes, Bruce David, Christmas: A Candid History, pp. 80‚Äì81. Nast drew a new image of \\"Santa Claus\\" annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the modern vision of the figure, perhaps based on the English figure of Father Christmas. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920sMikkelson, Barbara and David P., \\"The Claus That Refreshes\\" , Snopes.com, 2006. and continues through the present day. Santa Claus reacts to a toy request (Jonathan Meath as Santa) Father Christmas, a jolly, stout, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and drunkenness rather than the bringing of gifts. In Victorian Britain, his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French P√®re No√´l evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while La Befana is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the Epiphany. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby Jesus gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht, or Black Peter. In other versions, elves make the toys. His wife is referred to as Mrs. Claus. There has been some opposition to the narrative of the American evolution of Saint Nicholas into the modern Santa. It has been claimed that the Saint Nicholas Society was not founded until 1835, almost half a century after the end of the American War of Independence. Moreover, a study of the \\"children's books, periodicals and journals\\" of New Amsterdam by Charles Jones revealed no references to Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas. However, not all scholars agree with Jones's findings, which he reiterated in a book-length study in 1978;Jones, Charles W., Saint Nicholas of Myra, Bari, and Manhattan: Biography of a Legend (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978). Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York was alive and well from the early settlement of the Hudson Valley on. Current tradition in several Latin American countries (such as Venezuela and Colombia) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional religious beliefs and the iconography of Santa Claus imported from the United States. In South Tyrol (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Switzerland, the Christkind (Je≈æ√≠≈°ek in Czech, J√©zuska in Hungarian and Je≈æi≈°ko in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from Saint Basil on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast. The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a bishop's dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.Matera, Mariane. \\"Santa: The First Great Lie\\" , Citybeat, Issue 304. Multiple gift-giver figures exist in Poland, varying between regions and individual families. St Nicholas (≈öwiƒôty Miko≈Çaj) dominates Central and North-East areas, the Starman (Gwiazdor) is most common in Greater Poland, Baby Jesus (DzieciƒÖtko) is unique to Upper Silesia, with the Little Star (Gwiazdka) and the Little Angel (Anio≈Çek) being common in the South and the South-East. Grandfather Frost (Dziadek Mr√≥z) is less commonly accepted in some areas of Eastern Poland. It is worth noting that across all of Poland, St Nicholas is the gift giver on the Saint Nicholas Day on December 6.

The VDS was for some decades the Italian competitor of the French BCG vaccine against tuberculosis.  History  The VDS, definitively standardized between 1948 and 1953 by Professor Gaetano Salvioli, originated first in the studies and vaccine products of Professor Edoardo Maragliano (1849‚Äì1940) Edoardo Maragliano (Genoa, 1 June 1849 - Genoa, 10 March 1940) was an Italian doctor and clinician. Creator and developer of the first anti-tuberculosis vaccination (the so-called \\"Maragliano Vaccine\\"), he was Senator of the Kingdom of Italy since 1900. and Professor Giovanni Petragnani (1893‚Äì1969), physiologist and rector of the University of Siena. If Maragliano could boast, in 1903, at the World Congress of Medicine in Madrid that he was the first to develop an anti-tuberculosis serum with killed bacilli, Petragnani further developed his previous experiences and from 1927 to 1935 defined the Italian anti-tuberculosis vaccine under the name AIP (Anatubercolina Integrale Petragnani). When Petragnani interrupted his studies and applications (because he was appointed in 1935 by Benito Mussolini, as Director General of Public Health), Professor Gaetano Salvioli continued his studies and applications. From 1935 to 1948 Salvioli proceeded to the formulation of a vaccine called in that period VPS (vaccine Petragnani Salvioli).  Composition  The VDS consisted of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (or Koch's bacilli), killed by heat and added to ferment hyaluronidase.Minerva Medica (rivista ) vol. 54 ‚Äì n. 78 (29 September 1963) Torino da pagina 2808 One dose for newborns consisted of \\"a single intradermal injection, carried out at about half of the palmar face of the forearm, is used to introduce into the newborn baby a dose N of lyophilized anti-tuberculosis vaccine consisting of human Koch [bK] bacilli and cattle killed rapidly by heat.

The bacterial patinas, or veils of the cultivated bacteria, were broken up and had to be pulverized, first with a spatula and then with mechanical stirrers to obtain a finer dispersion of the bacilli. The killing of the bacterial suspensions was carried out with the exposure of the duration of few minutes to the heat under pressure at a temperature of 110¬∞, but avoiding boiling.Gaetano Salvioli in Minerva Medica (rivista) n. 30 ‚Äì 1959 ‚ÄìTorino- p. 1066  The ground Petragnani  The composition and layout of the land Petragnani was as follows. One took 150 cubic centimeters of milk to which were added 1 gram of peptone, 6 grams of potato starch and a peeled potato washed and in pieces. It was brought in bain-marie boiling and shaken everything until the ground had assumed a consistency of sticky type. It was left, always in a bain-marie for about another 30 minutes. It was cooled to about 40 degrees and added 4 eggs and a whole yolk. We filtered through sterile gauze in a graduated cylinder and we added to the filtrate 3% of glycerine and 4% of an aqueous solution to 2% of malachite. It was then distributed in large tubes and it was coagulated at 80-85¬∞ for 30 minutes by means of a device designed by Petragnani himself, which provided for a thermoregulator and special large inclined tubes so that the soil solidified like a flute beak.Eugenio Morelli ‚Äì Giuseppe Daddi ‚Äì Trattato di tisiologia ‚Äì Vallardi editore ‚Äì 1961 ‚Äì Milano- p 359  Areas of application  In the second post-war period, the spread of TB in Italy was still very high, but antituberculous vaccination was not mandatory. The bibliography of the time indicates that from 1948 to 1970 the VDS was applied very widely in different parts of Italy. In 1970 it was declared that about 100,000 vaccinations had been performed with positive results.Atti 2^ conferenza on antituberculare vaccinazioni con VDS (edito da GP Salvioli) 1970 ‚Äì Bologna It was widely applied in the municipality and province of Bologna, in particular at the pediatric clinic of the University of Bologna, directed by Professor Gaetano Salvioli himself. Over the years there were several Italian centers (pediatric clinics, provincial consortia antitubercolari, headquarters of ONMI (Opera Nazionale Maternit√† Infanzia) that applied the \\"Italian-style vaccine\\" as they used to say at the time to distinguish it from the \\"French-style vaccine\\", the competitor BCG. The VDS was also applied abroad: in Osaka in Japan, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Kolwezi (now in the Democratic Republic of Congo). In the area of Bologna (municipality and province) up to 80% of newborns were vaccinated. In the province of Venice, the Consortium Antitubercolare Provincial vaccinated between 1953 and 1958 about 16 000 people, especially primary school children.Minerva Medica ‚Äì n.30 ‚Äì 1959 Torino ‚Äì Atti convegno decennale sulla vaccinazione antitubercolare con il metodo italiano dedicato al VDS -Bologna 6 dicembre 1958 ‚Äìpp 1063‚Äì1120  The involuntary experiment of Dolo (Venice)  Between 1938 and the first months of 1943 Professor Sandro Taronna (1901‚Äì1972), director of the Consortium Antitubercolare in Venice had vaccinated 354 children in the orphanage Pio Ospedale della Piet√† of Venice. Because of the bombing of the city, 132 children were transferred to the sanatorium building of Dolo in Venice, of which 54 were vaccinated with VPS. Unfortunately, tuberculosis also entered into the sanatorium, causing several victims. This involuntary situation was studied after the war for about 10 years as an exceptional case. After a year of forced cohabitation because of the war, of the 54 vaccinated, 49 survived. 5 died but was verified by autopsies that it happened due to other causes. Of the 78 unvaccinated, 48 survived but 12 died due to Tuberculosis. 18 others died from other causes.Ferro Alessandro ‚Äì Taronna Sandro (1950) ‚Äì Esperimento involontario sulla resistenza di bambini vaccinati (VPS) e non vaccinati contro la tbc di fronte a contagio altamente infettante: Nota 1¬™‚Äì Notizie sull‚Äôepisodio di Dolo a carattere perfettamente sperimentale e sulla mortalit√† dei due gruppi -in La Clinica Pediatrica Bologna ‚Äì anno 32 ‚Äì fasc.n 5 ‚Äì1950 ‚Äì pp 225 ‚Äì 263  The two producers of the VDS  The Italian anti-tubercular vaccine VDS was initially produced by the company Alfa Farmaceutici of Bologna of Dr Marino Golinelli.Marino Golinelli (San Felice sul Panaro, 11 October 1920) is an Italian entrepreneur and philanthropist, founder of the company Alfa Farmaceutici, then Alfa Wassermann, then Alfasigma. https://www.fondazionegolinelli.it/en Considering the excellent results and the spread that had the VDS, between 1956 and 1958 the ISM (Istituto Sieroterapico Milanese Serafino Belfanti) in Milan, then led by the Honorable Giovanni Battista Migliori, acquired the production rights from Alfa. The ISM of Milan was the largest public company of serums and vaccines in Italy. ISM was, from 1894 to 1994, a non-profit institution entirely owned by the Municipality of Milan, with a plant in via Darwin in Milan. In the two-year period 1956‚Äì1958 ISM produced six supplies. In the summer of 1958, however, he gave up the production of the vaccine because its 6th supply of 3000 pieces, turned out not to correspond to the protocol provided by Professor Gaetano Salvioli. This batch caused an anomalous vaccination that involved, with a plague at the point of inoculation, 2797 schoolchildren from the province of Venice and infants of Ferrara and Trieste. The plague took several months to heal. From 1959, until the decision of the Ministry of Health to officially adopt the BCG in Italy (art.1 of the Ministerial Decree of 25 June 1976), the production of VDS returned to the companies of Dr. Marino Golinelli.Renato Vecchiato ‚Äì una cicatrice collettiva ‚Äì Roma 2016  See also  * History of tuberculosis * Timeline of tuberculosis  References  Category:Tuberculosis vaccines ","title":"Salvioli's diffusing vaccine"},{"id":"62533154","text":"Mrika Nik√ßi (born December 6, 2001) is an Albanian mountaineer from the Republic of Kosovo.

On 15 August 2019, as a seventeen years old, she became the youngest female in the world to climb all the Seven Summits, together with her father Arianit Nik√ßi(Albanian mountaineer). They became the first Albanians to summit all the Seven Summits. They reached all the Seven Summits for 17 months, six hardest peaks (Vinson, Aconcagua, Everest, Denali, Elbrus and Carstensz Pyremid) summit-ed for 240 days (eight months). They reached this goal following their project Mrika Seven Summits. After their success, they have appeared in almost all Albanian media and have been an attraction with their interviews She has also appeared at International media expressing her experiences  Early life  She was born in Peja, Republic of Kosovo where she lives now. Since she was 7 she started training karate, and was a very successful competitor, champion of Kosovo in Kata and Kumite, also she has black belt grade, Dan1. Mrika was a very successful ski competitor too, now she skis for fun with her friends, family and her clients.  Mountain climbing career  Mrika with the support of her father, who accompanies her in all mountaineering activities, has begun with mountaineering when she was 13 years old. Mrika has climbed national and regional summits such as: * Gjeravica (2,656), winter climb (highest peak of Kosovo) * Jezerca (2.694), winter climb, highest peak in the Dinaric Alps in Albania * Korab (2.794) (Macedonia‚ÄìAlbania border), the highest peak in Albania, winter climb * Hajla (2,403) winter climbing (Kosovo) * Maja e Titos (2.747)-winter climb (Macedonia) * Maja e Zez√´ (2,528)‚Äìwinter climbing (Kosovo) During 2017 Mrika has continued with her mountaineering activities by climbing 2 summits in Bulgaria, specifically the summit of the Seven Lakes in Rila with an altitude (alt) of 2,648 meters, and the summit of Musala 2,925 alt, the highest peak in Balkan. Also, during 2017 Mrika has attempted the climbing of other European summits. Due to the weather conditions that have undermined the safety of the mountaineers participating in the expedition, these summit attempts will need to repeat: # Mount Blanc‚Äì alt4,880 m ‚Äì attempt and climb up to the alt of 3,700 m (France). # Grand Paradiso‚Äì alt4,061m ‚Äì attempt and climb up to the alt of 3.650 m (Italy). In 2018 Mrika has continued with mountaineering and achieved additional success by climbing to another 2 summits, specifically Grossglockner - 3,798 alt (Austria), and one of the Seven World Summits, the summit of Kilimanjaro - 5,895 alt (Tanzania - Africa).  Seven Summits Challenge  Based on the success achieved so far and her will to reach a world class level, Mrika and her father have begun preparations for the accomplishment of the Seven World Summits Challenge, and climbed all the seven summits by the following itinerary: Mrika at the Everest Base Camp # Kilimanjaro-Africa (5.895 alt), climbed January 29th 2018 # Vinson-Antarctica (4,892), climbed on December 16, 2018 # Aconcagua-South America (6,962), climbed 16 February 2019 # Mount Everest-Asia (8,850), climbed 27 May 2019 # Denali‚ÄìNorth America (6,194) climbed on 20 June 2019 # Mount Elbrus‚Äì Russia (5,642), climbed on 20 July 2019 # Carstensz Pyramid‚ÄìIndonesia (4,884), climbed on 15 August, 2019 During her challenge she has experienced difficulties that each mountaineer dream off. During the Mount Everest Summit she has avoided the risks by cleverly choosing the time where to climb. In here interview with CNN she said : \\"You know what, when you decide to come and climb Everest, you prepare yourself that you are going to see dead bodies,\\" Mrika adds. \\"Maybe something can happen to you, your father, or whoever you're climbing with, so you prepare. You see a dead body and it's like, it's ok. He's gone. I don't want to be like him; I have to move on.\\" \\"We saw dead bodies along the way.

She was one of three sister ships (the other sisters were and ) delivered to the company in 1929 for the route between Britain and New Zealand. Rangitiki was built by John Brown & Company at Clydebank, Scotland and launched on 27 August 1928. Rangitiki measured just under 16,700 gross register tons, was in length and in breadth. It carried 598 passengers in 1st, 2nd and 3rd classes and had refrigerated cargo space of . The ship was powered by two Brown Sulzer type diesel engines with a total output of , turning twin propellers. Service history Ordered in 1927, Rangitiki was launched in 1928 and entered service with the New Zealand Shipping Company in 1929 sailing between Great Britain and New Zealand on the route via the Panama Canal. At the start of the Second World War the ship was used for transporting children from Britain to Australia before being converted into a troopship. In November 1940 Rangitiki was the largest ship in convoy HX 84 when the convoy was attacked by the German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. Rangitiki and most other ships in the convoy escaped due to the actions of escort commander Edward Fegen, captain of HMS Jervis Bay and Hugh Pettigrew captain of SS Beaverford who sacrificed themselves and their ships to give the merchant ships the time to get away. The following month the Rangitiki had another close shave when sailing as part of convoy WS 5, the convoy was attacked by German heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. Returned to service between Britain, Australia and New Zealand in 1945 the Rangitiki carried numerous servicemen home from Britain as well a number of war brides. Following an extensive refit in 1947‚Äì48 the ship continued in service until July 1962 when after 87 peactetime return voyages between Britain and New Zealand it was withdrawn. Sold for scrap Rangitiki sailed to Spain and was broken up in Valencia in October 1962. Modifications in service Both before and after its maiden voyage the ship was found to have stability issues especially when sailing in ballast so modifications including reducing the height of the ship by removing most of the bridge deck, shortening the funnels and adding more permanent ballast were made. During the refit in 1947‚Äì48 the John Brown built Sulzer type engines were replaced with two Doxford diesel engines with a total power output of raising the ships maximum speed to .

Tichauer was born in Pozsony, Austro-Hungarian Kingdom (now Bratislava, Slovakia), as Helen Spitzer, was kidnapped by the SS, and held in death camps, in Poland, lived in displaced persons camps in Germany, after the war. It was there that she married Erwin Tichauer, then the chief of security of her camp. The Tichauer were called upon by the United Nations on multiple humanitarian projects. Erwin Tichauer also served as a professor of bio- engineering, at University of New South Wales and New York University. SS Detention Tichauer was one of the first women sent to Auschwitz in early 1942. Eventually Auschwitz camp authorities discovered Tichauer's skills as a graphics designer, which preserved her from being killed, and even allowed her relatively free-run of the camp, and even occasional excursions, outside the camp. Multiple historians have used Tichauer's account of life in Auschwitz. Konrad Kwiet contributed a biography of Tichauer as a chapter of ‚ÄúApproaching an Auschwitz Survivor‚Äù Tichauer played in the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz, assembled to meet trains of individuals destined to go straight to the gas chambers. The orchestra would play calming music so captives who did not know they were about to die would be more tractable. In December 2019 The New York Times published an article on a previously undocumented aspect of her life in Auschwitz - 25 year old Tichauer had taken a 17 year old lover in Auschwitz, David Wisnia. The pair had been able to engage in monthly liaisons, and had planned to meet, and marry, if they should survive the war. However, they lost track of one another, for several years, and, when they had news of one another, they were both married. Camp authorities tried to evacuate the camp, and destroy evidence of their crimes, as the armies of the Soviet Union approached. Tichauer and a friend were able escape from their guards during a death march to another camp. In her PhD thesis Anna-Madeleine Halkes Carey described Tichauer as a holocaust survivor whose multiple accounts of the camp system had been thoroughly confirmed. Post-war displaced person She married Erwin Tichauer, chief of security at the Feldafing displaced persons camp. According to The New York Times Tichauer was vague about efforts she made to help refugees with limited travel documents to make their way to Israel, and other safer places. United Nations projects, and life with Erwin Tichauer The Tichauers participated in United Nation's projects in Peru, Bolivia and Indonesia. According to The New York Times \\"Throughout their travels, Ms. Tichauer continued to learn new languages and use her design skills to help populations in need, particularly pregnant women and new mothers.\\" The Tichauers never had children. Erwin Tichauer was an academic, a professor of bio-engineering, at the University of New South Wales, and New York University. Tichauer lived with him until his death in 1996. History professor Konrad Kwiet, who had survived World War 2 as a child, said Tichauer served as a mother-figure for him, and phoned her once a week, after she left Sydney. Relationship with David Wisnia Wisnia's first job, at Auschwitz, was to retrieve the bodies of captives who committed suicide by electrocuting themselves by throwing themselves at the camp's electrified fences. Guards who learned he was a skilled singer started calling upon him to sing to them, and he was later transferred to work as a bathroom attendant in the sauna operated for the guard force. Tichauer met him there, and was able to use her position of trust to arrange privacy for their liaisons. The pair agreed to try and meet, if they should both survive the war. Wisnia did not tell his children and grandchildren he had a lover, while in Auschwitz, and Tichauer did not tell her biographers. The New York Times described Wisnia and Tichauer having a final meeting, near the end of her life. Wisnia was able to ask her whether she had used her position of trust to help him survive the death camp, and she confirmed that she had been able to prevent him being shipped to an extermination camp on five separate occasions.

Postparietals are in deep pink, at the back of the skull Postparietals are cranial bones present in fish and many tetrapods. Although initially a pair of bones, many lineages possess postparietals which were fused into a single bone. The postparietals were dermal bones situated along the midline of the skull, behind the parietal bones. They formed part of the rear edge of the skull roof, and the lateral edge of each postparietal often contacts the tabular and supratemporal bones. In fish, the postparietals are elongated, typically the largest components of the skull roof. Tetrapods possessed shorter postparietals, which were reduced further and shifted towards the braincase in amniotes. At several points in synapsid evolution, the postparietals fused to each other and the tabulars during embryological development. This fusion produces the interparietal bone, which is inherited by mammals. Postparietals are common in extinct amphibians and early reptiles.

Watson & Day (1916)'s \\"orthodox\\" interpretation of fish skulls argued that fish lacked independent postparietals, with the elongated paired midline bones at the back of the skull being interpreted as parietals. On the other hand, Westoll (1938) proposed an alternative interpretation which identified the bones as postparietals based on comparisons between early tetrapods and their sarcopterygian ancestors. This latter interpretation has usurped the \\"orthodox\\" interpretation and is currently more widespread among paleontologists Although the generally large size of fish postparietals are inconsistent with the smaller postparietals of tetrapods, there are many factors supporting the identification of the large posterior midline elements as postparietals, rather than parietals. These include their contact with tabulars and supratemporals, the fact that they are positioned behind the bones which surround the parietal foramen (i.e. the parietal bones), and how transitional taxa show apparent homology with tetrapod postparietals and the large posterior midline elements of fish. Studies of Ichthyostega, Elpistostege, and Edops in particular have demonstrated this concept. One objection to this interpretation is that the single midline postparietal of Ichthyostega has a transverse bend of the lateral line, which in fish typically occurs on extrascapular elements (plates at the back of the skull formed from enlarged neck scales). Proponents of the \\"orthodox\\" interpretation used this to argue that the unpaired postparietal of Icthyostega is a modified extrascapular element not homologous to what they identify as the \\"parietals\\" of fish. However, this is more easily explained by a simple shift in the position of the lateral line, as the postparietals of Icthyostega are otherwise identical in proportion and position (and therefore considered homologous) to the large paired posterior midline elements of fish. Many sarcopterygian fish (including living coelocanths) possess a large, robust plate at the back of the skull known as a postparietal shield. This plate consists mostly of the large postparietals along its midline, with smaller tabular bones and one or more supratemporal bones along its edge. The postparietal shield often articulates with the rest of the skull through a mobile joint. As sarcopterygians acquire more derived features and eventually evolve into tetrapods, the postparietals gradually shrink, losing their status as the largest midline elements of the skull and allowing the more anteriorly- situated parietal bones (and the newly acquired frontal bones) to acquire that status. The postparietals also becomes more solidly attached to the parietals. Most lissamphibians lack postparietals, with the exception of a few anurans such as Pelates (spadefoot toads) and Bombina (fire-bellied toads). In diadectomorphs, the postparietals fuse to each other. The seymouriamorph Discosauriscus has a high degree of interspecific variation in regards to postparietal fusion; they may either fuse with each other, not at all, or with the adjacent tabulars but not with each other. Closer to the base of amniotes, the postparietal shifts from the dorsal portion of the skull to the occipital (braincase) portion, sloping downwards in the process.  Synapsids  The skull of Dimetrodon (an early synapsid with a single midline postparietal) in occipital view. Early synapsids inherited postparietals (sometimes paired) from their non-amniote ancestors. Embryological data indicates that the interparietal bone of mammals forms from the fusion of four bones during early development: a pair of medial neural crest elements edged by lateral mesoderm elements. The medial neural crest-derived pair are considered homologous to the postparietals of other vertebrates, while the lateral mesoderm bones are considered homologous to the tabular bones. In almost all mammals, all four bones are fused to each other by the time of birth, and in many cases they additionally fuse to the parietal and supraoccipital in adulthood. Many non- mammalian synapsids have three bones in the interparietal region as adults: one midline bone and two lateral bones. In these situations, the midline bone (often also termed an interparietal) is a fused postparietal while the lateral bones are tabulars. Independently-derived fusion between paired postparietals and/or the adjacent tabulars is common among synapsids, meaning that many different lineages have one, three, or four bones in the region which makes up the mammalian interparietal. In rare cases there are two interparietal bones, formed when left and right postparietals each fuse to their corresponding tabular, but not each other.  Reptiles  The postparietals continue to shrink and move further back in the skull in reptiles, no longer forming any contribution to the ceiling of the brain cavity. Small paired or fused postparietals are common in Permian parareptiles and eureptiles, including early diapsids such as Petrolacosaurus and Youngina. Postparietals were subsequently lost at the base of Sauria, the expansive diapsid subgroup containing all living species of reptiles. Archosauriforms (and their sister taxon Tasmaniosaurus) briefly reacquired postparietals in the form of a single fused bone. As in synapsids, this bone has sometimes been termed an interparietal. Proterosuchids, erythrosuchids, euparkeriids, and Asperoris are all known to have possessed interparietals, while the bone was absent in proterochampsids, Doswellia, Vancleavea, Litorosuchus, most or all phytosaurs, and archosaurs. The only true archosaur generally considered to possess an interparietal as an adult is a single specimen of Gracilisuchus. Paired postparietals have also been observed in Alligator mississippiensis embryos, although they are incorporated into the supraoccipital by the time of hatching. One proposal used developmental data to argue that the \\"parietal\\" of birds was actually derived from postparietals. However, subsequent review provided evidence against that hypothesis by demonstrating that birds had inherited a consistent relationship between the skull roof and brain cavity; this relationship excluded the postparietals from the brain cavity (at least in reptiles) and supported the traditional interpretation that the parietal of birds was homologous to that of other reptiles.

History  A woman from Nouakchott sews a kha√Øma Aminetou Mint El-Moctar On 17 April 1999, Mauritanian women's rights activist Aminetou Mint El-Moctar founded The Association of Women Heads of Households, in order to campaign and raise awareness about the human rights restrictions that women from Mauritania may face. From its outset, the AFCF has been designed to reflect the diversity of Mauritania, including Arab, Berber, Haratin, Pulaar, Soninke and Wolof women. The AFCF has been at the forefront of a number of campaign in Mauritania to improve the conditions of women in the country. In 2011, the organisation was working with the government to bring a stop to the exportation of child brides to the Arabian peninsula. The organisation has campaigned widely against the practice of force-feeding young women before marriage, a traditional practice created in order to reflect the wealth of the husband, but one that in fact restricts the health of women and their engagement in local communities and beyond. In 2016, the AFCF proposed new legislation to the Mauritanian government to defend women rights, in particular to introduce harsher sentences for rape. The proposal was rejected by the Mauritanian government as it did not comply with Sharia law. They have campaigned against sexual violence against women, in urban and also in rural contexts and from 2012 encouraged all police stations to have social workers on site to support survivors of sexual violence and to encourage the women to prosecute. The campaign to bring an end to female genital mutilation. Mauritania only prohibited in slavery in 1981 and it is still practised throughout the country. The AFCF campaigns against modern slavery. For her role in the anti-slavery programme, El-Moctar was nominated for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize. They work to end the abuse of domestic workers, as well as encouraging women to take part in political life, locally and nationally. In 2017, the AFCF encouraged the government to adopt a new law promoting sexual health. As of 2019 the AFCF has 12,000 members, six rescue centres for victims, 168 social workers, four lawyers and a contact person in every city in Mauritania. A literacy campaign funded by the AFCF has reached over 20,000 girls in rural areas of Nouakchott alone and has helped over 73,000 people gain civil status and therefore access to rights and protection.

The epidemic as of December 8 is currently ongoing. As of January 5, there have been 612 cases of measles. Background A hypothetical measles timeline exposure to illness Beginning in 2017, the WHO began tracking measles outbreaks in the Asia Pacific Region. Measles has been spreading throughout the Pacific region, with outbreaks in Tonga, Fiji, Australia, Cambodia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Samoa, the Philippines and New Zealand. Previously, measles had been believe to be eradicated in the Asia Pacific Region, with the last reported case in 2014, prior to the outbreak. Samoa, Tonga and Fiji have all declared states of emergency to tackle their 2019 measles outbreaks. When contrasting the scores of deaths in Samoa to the lack of fatalities in Tonga and Fiji, this is put down to the far higher vaccination rates in Tonga and Fiji compared to the 31% in Samoa. Most of the cases have been on the island of Tongatapu where the first cases started, with 88% of all cases located on Tongatapu and 10% located on the neighboring island of Vava‚Äôu. Vaccine hesitancy The outbreak has been attributed to a sharp drop in measles vaccination in Samoa from the previous year, following an incident in 2018 when two infants died in Samoa shortly after receiving measles vaccinations, which led the country to suspend its measles vaccination program. The reason for the two infants' deaths was incorrect preparation of the vaccine by two nurses who mixed vaccine powder with expired anaesthetic. The nurses responsible were sentenced to 5 years in prison with manslaughter charges and Samoa began arresting anti-vaccination advocates. The United States' Center of Disease Control sent representatives to Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji to coordinate vaccine efforts and combate vaccine misinformation. Government response Ministry of Health chief executive, Siale 'Akau'ola, said more than 12,000 people had been re-vaccinated. This vaccination program targeted school children and 6-11 month old infants. A second vaccination program was conducted in February 2020, targeting children ages 1-9 years old. The vaccination rate in Tonga was over 90% which might stem the infection rates seen in Samoa and New Zealand. In November, 2019, the Tongan Minister of Education shut down all primary schools until the beginning of 2020. International response UNICEF has sent almost 300,000 vaccines to Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Tokelau and Tuvalu, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji have also declared states of emergency. The WHO and UNICEF have developed a toolkit for Pacific Island Nations following the outbreak to aid in further measles prevention. Tonga closed all schools for several days while American Samoa required all travelers from Tonga and Samoa to present proof of vaccination.Samoa's measles crisis has claimed 15 lives but how did the outbreak start?, Tasha Wibawa, ABC, 18 Nov 2019 The United States' Center for Disease control placed a Level 1 travel ban to the Kingdom of Tonga following the outbreak. Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Tokelau and Tuvalu. Since 1 October, UNICEF has delivered 12,000 measles vaccines to Tonga. UNICEF later provided 6,000 additional doses of the vaccine cold chain following the success of the first administration. Through domestic and internationally coordinated efforts, 44,605 individuals under the age of 24 were vaccinated by January 2020. This included administration of supplementary vaccines for previously vaccinated individuals in conjunction with routine childhood vaccination. On December 10th, American Samoa declared a measle outbreak and closed public schools and park gatherings and suspended all entry permits for those travelling through Samoa and Tonga to American Samoa.

Origin Noodle latkes originated within the Romanian Jewish community several hundred years ago, and were brought to Israel and the United States where their descendants still prepare this dish. Overview Noodle latkes consist of egg noodles or fine egg pasta that has been boiled and drained, and combined with ingredients including egg, butter or margarine and a number of other ingredients to form a batter, which is shaped into latkes and fried in oil or schmaltz. They are traditionally prepared during the Jewish holiday of Chanukah by Romanian Jews, as foods fried in oil are traditionally consumed by Jewish people during Hanukkah to commemorate the miracle of the oil and the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in Ancient Israel. Variants Noodle latkes come in a number of varieties, some of which are listed below. Sweet Sweet variants include egg, butter or margarine (if pareve) sugar, cinnamon, and oftentimes raisin, and may be dusted with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar upon serving.

Deutsche Bank AG (591 U.S. ___, docket 19-760), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that considered whether or not congressional committees could subpoena the tax returns of President Donald Trump. Background The case has had multiple stages of movement through lower courts before being presented for arguments to the Supreme Court of the United States. Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, 943 F. 3d 627 - Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit 2019 Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, 940 F. 3d 146 - Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit 2019 Trump v. DEUTSCHE BANK AG, 140 S. Ct. 660 - Supreme Court 2019 Lower courts The case was argued before District Judge Edgardo Ramos of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who on May 22, 2019 ruled against Trump and ordered that the banks comply with the subpoena. Trump appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which heard oral arguments on August 23, 2019. While the appeal was pending before the court, Capital One submitted a letter to the court saying it does not have any documents which fall under the purview of the subpoena, while Deutsche Bank filed a letter saying that it did. The letter had two names redacted; an unredacted copy of the letter was also submitted under seal. In September, a motion was jointly filed by CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, AP, and Politico to unseal the names; a week later, Reuters and Dow Jones & Company filed a motion to the same effect. In a twelve-page unanimous opinion by Senior Judge Jon O. Newman, the judges denied the requests to unseal, writing that the mere filing of a sealed document is not sufficient grounds for it to enter public access. They also said they would have been more compelled to unseal the names if Trump himself was one of the redacted names, but the court said that of them was. The December 3, 2019 majority opinion was also written by Newman, with Peter W. Hall joining and Debra Ann Livingston dissenting in part. Judge Newman's ruling mostly affirmed the district court's ruling that ordered the banks to give documents to the House committees, but partially remanded the case back to the district court to allow Trump to argue against disclosing other specific personal information. In her partial dissent, Judge Livingston expressed concern that the subpoenas were too broad, calling them \\"deeply troubling,\\" and would have fully remanded the case to the district court in order to address this concern. Following this ruling, Trump appealed both this case and Trump v. Mazars to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari in both cases. Supreme Court The question facing the Supreme Court is whether the U.S. House of Representatives has the authority to issue subpoenas to obtain the private financial records of the president and his businesses. On December 13, 2019, the Supreme Court consolidated the case with Trump v. Mazars. Oral arguments were originally scheduled to take place on March 31, 2020, but two weeks before the arguments were to take place, the Supreme Court postponed arguments in response to the coronavirus pandemic and waited one month to announce the rescheduled date. In April 2020, the Supreme Court said that oral argument in the Mazars case and other cases would be heard by telephone. The oral arguments for the consolidated Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, as well as Trump v. Vance, were heard on May 12. In arguing against the need for subpoenas for tax returns, Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall repeatedly cited that they presented \\"dangers of harassing and distracting and undermining the President\\". Congressional subpoenas related to this case will expire with the end of the 116th Congress at the end of 2020.  Decision  In a 7-2 decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court vacated the decisions of the appeals courts and remanded the case back to the lower courts for to further assessment of separation of powers between the President and Congress. The Court posited a set of considerations for the courts to evaluate whether the subpoenas are justifiable. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito each wrote dissenting opinions, with both asserting that the subpoenas were invalid. Thomas claimed that since the documents sought do not pertain to the Presidency, the subpoenas could only have been made as part of an impeachment investigation. Alito agreed that the case should be remanded, but argued that House committees had not shown adequate justification in this case, and that the majority's criteria were an insufficient remedy for the lower courts.

Career Born in Lima, Vergara began his professional football career in 2003, when he debuted for Universitario de Deportes. He would then go on to play for various clubs in Peru such as Sport √Åncash, CNI, C√©sar Vallejo, Sport Boys, Real Garcilaso, Inti Gas, Alfonso Ugarte de Puno, Los Caimanes, Atl√©tico Minero, Sport Loreto, UTC and Deportivo Binacional. With Binacional, Vergara won the 2019 Torneo Apertura and qualified for the championship round of the 2019 Peruvian Liga 1 playoffs.https://int.soccerway.com/national/peru/primera- division/2019/apertura/r51341/tables/ However, a car accident a few days before the scheduled matches for the championship round resulted in his tragic death. Death On 2 December 2019, Vergara was involved in a car accident along with teammates Donald Mill√°n and Jeferson Collazos. The three footballers were headed to Juliaca from Puno to train with Deportivo Binacional as preparation for their upcoming series of matches for the championship round of the 2019 Peruvian Liga 1 playoffs. Around 14:30 PET, Vergara's car flipped on the side of the Puno‚ÄìJuliaca road due to slippery conditions caused by rain and hail. The three were helped out of the vehicle by local rescuers and taken to Cl√≠nica Americana, a clinic in Juliaca. Mill√°n and Collazos were discharged unharmed but Vergara was in critical condition. Binacional then announced through its social media networks that blood donors were needed for surgical intervention. Hours later, the club announced the passing of Vergara. The clinic indicated through a press release that the impact of the steering wheel with Vergara resulted in \\"a severe massive hemorrhage in the left hemithorax.\\" Vergara suffered a perforation of the liver by a broken rib, triggering a hemorrhage. Despite the early intervention of the doctors, the player died.

Plot 14-year-old May is married off as the third wife to a middle-aged landowner of a rural village where silk is harvested. She soon finds that, having given birth to a son, the first wife exerts greater influence in the family than the second, who has only had three daughters, and that the only way to gain security and independence is to give birth to a male child. Her husband's wives are welcoming to her and when she expresses that she finds sex painful they urge her to experiment sexually with herself in order to understand her own desires. May conceives a child. While this brings further intimacy between May and her husband she continues to find him unappealing and rejects his sexual advances. She discovers that Xuan, the second wife, is having an affair with the landowner's son from mistress Ha, his first wife. Due to May rejecting her husband, he returns to his first wife and conceives a child with her as well. May prays her own child is a son who will secure her position within the family. Mistress Ha has a miscarriage and May blames her prayer for a son as the reason for it. She is reassured by Xuan who tells her that throughout her pregnancies she too prayed for sons. May realizes that she has burgeoning feelings for Xuan and kisses her. Xuan rejects May's advances, brushing it off as a symptom of her pregnancy and telling her she loves her like a daughter. May gives birth to a girl. Mistress Ha's son is of marrying age and his parents conceive of a match for him. In love with Xuan, he tries to refuse marriage, threatening suicide. He is nevertheless pressured to marry a young girl around May's age. Son is disgusted with the marriage and refuses to tough his new bride. After begging his father to annul the marriage his father attempts to do so, but is rejected by the bride's father. Ashamed the young bride commits suicide.

He was one of the earliest students to graduate from the Department of Entomology and Ornithology at the University of Nebraska. He worked as an entomologist at the Los Angeles County Museum (now the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County). He was particularly interested in insect pests, including the cotton boll weevil, and their control. Mainly between 1904 and 1931, he published numerous scientific papers and other works on the topic; perhaps the most significant being the book Sanitary Entomology (1921), of which a sixth edition was published in 2010. During the late 1930s, he taught entomology at Glendale Junior College in Los Angeles; where he influenced Charles Anthony Fleschner, who went on to have a distinguished career in entomology at University of California, Riverside. He described several taxa; but all except Premnotrypes, a genus of weevils in family Curculionidae, appear to have been subsequently reclassified as junior synonyms. Some materials relating to Pierce are held in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The weevil species Premnotrypes piercei and have been named in his honor.

Torelli joined the band Rockets in 1976, and featured on their debut album. The following year, he played on another album coordinated by Massiera, Atlantide, and then on the cult psychedelic album L'Etrange Mr. Whinster, credited to Horrific Child. Torelli worked with the prolific Massiera as musician, composer, arranger and occasionally co- producer, on numerous prog rock and space disco albums and projects during the late 1970s. These included the albums Turn Radio On, Phantasmes, Space Woman (credited to the act Herman's Rocket), Galactic Soul (credited to Venus Gang), and singer Jessy Joyce's J. Joyce & Co., among others.

The company sells honey-related products and books, beauty products, beverages, and candles. The Savannah Bee Company has 14 locations in the United States. Founder Ted Dennard is the founder and president of the company. He was a beekeeper, and in 1999 his Tupelo honey was sold in a friend's Savannah Georgia store. Dennard founded the Savannah Bee Company 3 years later, in 2002. Dennard is concerned with bee conservation and threats to bee populations. In 2016 the company began to invest in teaching children about bees. He created a not for profit organization named the \\"Bee Cause Project\\". There are now 320 schools in all 50 states which have bee hives. In 2015 Dennard received a permit from the Bahamian government to bring 12 bee hives to the Bahamas. In 6 months the bee keepers were able to begin harvesting honey. From those bees the estimate is that there are now 15 hives. Company details In 2014 the Savannah Bee Company featured in Google's economic report. Google stated in a press release: \\"The Savannah Bee company has utilized online sales to better achieve results without expending a lot of money, as evidenced by their website‚Äôs exponential growth.\\" In 2013 the company's online sales of honey, health and other products grossed $1.35 million. By 2019 the company had opened 14 stores in the United States, with multiple stores in Tennessee, South Caroline, and Georgia, as well as stores in Arizona, Connecticut, Colorado, and Florida. The Savannah Bee Company is referred to as a \\"major player in the honey market\\". The Savannah Bee Company sells several different types of honey, from nectar that bees collect from one flower. An example is Tupelo Honey: bees are moved to the area where the Tupelo tree blooms, and the resulting honey is from that flower only. The company sells 700,000 containers of honey per year, which is 350,000 pounds of honey. As of 2020, there are 160 people working for the company, and 2,000 independent retailers selling Savannah Bee Honey.

E.g. in crystals the atoms order in regularly on wide ranges to form even gigantic highly ordered crystals (Naica Mine). However, crystals in reality are never perfect and have impurities or defects, which means, that a foreign atom resides on a lattice site or inbetween lattice sites (interstitials). These small defects and impurities cannot be seen by methods such as X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction, because these methods average in their nature of measurement over a large number of atoms and thus are insensitive to effects in local structure. Methods in nuclear spectroscopy use specific nuclei as probe. The nucleus of an atom is about 10,000 to 150,000 times smaller than the atom itself. It experiences the electric fields created by the atom's electrons that sourround the nucleus. In addition, the electric fields created by neighbouring atoms also influence the fields the nucleus experience. The interactions between the nucleus and these fields is called hyperfine interactions that influence the nucleus' properties. The nucleus therefore becomes very senstive to small changes in its hyperfine structure, that can be measured by methods of nuclear spectroscopy, such as e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance, M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy, and perturbed angular correlation. With the same methods, the local magnetic fields in a crystal structure can also be probed and provide a magnetic local structure. This is of great importance for the understanding of defects in magnetic materials, which have wide range of applications such as modern magnetic materials or the giant magnetoresistance effect, that is used in materials in the reader heads of harddrives. Research of the local structure of materials have become an important tool for the understanding of properties especially in functional materials, such as used in electronics, chips, batteries, semiconductors, or solar cells. Many of those materials are defect materials and their specific properties are controlled by defects.

Chand was embittered and notably started one of the major subsects of early Sikhism. This subsect came to be labelled as the Minas, literally \\"unscrupulous scoundrels\\", by his competition. According to The Encyclopaedia Britannica, Prithi Chand was a Sikh rebel leader who took a \\"distinctly hostile view\\" of his brother's appointment.Prithi Chand: Sikh Rebel Leader, Encyclopaedia Britannica Modern scholars have called his movement one of the unorthodox but influential sects that emerged in the history of Sikhism. Chand was an accomplished devotional poet. He created a parallel scripture which included the hymns of earlier Gurus and his own. His spiritual discourses attracted a large following and the official support of the Mughal Empire. His followers gained control of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar and neighboring region, while Guru Hargobind ‚Äì the sixth Guru of Sikhism, had to relocate his Guruship to the Himalayan Shivalik foothills. Chand and his followers rejected Guru Arjan and Guru Hargobind as the official followers of Guru Nanak ‚Äì the founder of Sikhism. His poetic abilities and his distribution of hymns of Guru Nanak and those of his own, likely triggered Guru Arjan to formulate and release the official first edition of the Adi Granth. There was a bitter competition between the followers of Guru Arjan and Prithi Chand for three generations. In contemporary Sikhism, the followers and movement led by Prithi Chand are considered as \\"dissenters\\". In the hagiographies and official Sikh history written by Chand's opposition, Chand is accused of attempting to poison Hargobind when he was a boy. He and his descendants ‚Äì Manohar Das (Miharban) and Harji (Hariji) ‚Äì are also accused of conspiring with the Muslim leaders such as Sulahi Khan to hurt and end the later Sikh Gurus, as well prevent them from entering Amritsar. The Minas literature does not support these allegations, presenting Chand as a devout supporter of Guru Arjan. There is likely \\"overt bias\\" against Chand in the competing biographies. Prithi Chand established his Guruship in Kotha Guru (about 35 kilometers northeast of Bathinda). He died there in 1618. His son Manohar Das, popularly known as Miharvan, grew up closely attached to both his father Prithi Chand and his uncle Guru Arjan. Miharvan succeeded Chand-led Sikh sect's fellowship. He was also a literary talent and a \\"luminary among medieval Sikh and Panjabi litterateurs\\" states Syan, and he composed hymns under the pen name of Prithi Chand. Prithi Chand and his early Sikh sect claimed to have the Guru Harsahai pothi, the earliest compiled Sikh scripture from the time of Guru Nanak. According to the literature of the Miharvan Sikhs, the pothi was given to Prithi Chand by Guru Arjan and this was in part the reason they claimed authenticity of their hymns and movement. The wars of Guru Gobind Singh against the Muslim commanders and the rise of the militant Khalsa ultimately ended the control of Amritsar by the followers of Prithi Chand. His movement and the \\"Minas\\" sect thereafter became largely extinct. According to Gurinder Singh Mann, the Sodhis of Guru Harsahai (35 kilometers west of Faridkot) and of Malwa region are the descendants of the Prithi Chand and Miharvan movement.

There are 4 types of these complexes: # Interpolyelectrolyte complexes (IPEC) or polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) # Hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complexes # Stereocomplexes # Charge-transfer complexes  Formation of interpolymer complexes  Interpolymer complexes could be prepared either by mixing complementary polymers in solutions or by matrix (template) polymerisation. It is also possible to prepare IPCs at liquid-liquid interfaces or at solid or soft surfaces. Usually the structure of IPCs formed will depend on many factors, including the nature of interacting polymers, concentrations of their solutions, nature of solvent, presence of inorganic ions or organic molecules in solutions, etc. Mixing of dilute polymer solutions usually leads to formation of IPCs as a colloidal dispersion, whereas more concentrated polymer solutions form IPCs in the form of a gel.  Methods to study interpolymer complexes  Methods to study interpolymer complexes could be classified into (1) approaches to demonstrate the fact of the complex formation and to determine the composition of IPCs in solutions; (2) approaches to study the structure of IPCs formed; (3) methods to characterize IPCs in solid state.  Applications of interpolymer complexes  IPCs are finding applications in pharmaceutics in the design of novel dosage forms.

Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 62nd Tank Battalion's name commemorated 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment Second Lieutenant Fulvio Jero, who had served in the LXII Tank Battalion \\"L\\" and was killed in action on 3 January 1941 during the Battle of Bardia. Equipped with M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers the battalion joined the Motorized Brigade \\"Aosta\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and on 27 August 1992 the 62nd Armored Battalion \\"M.O. Jero\\" merged with the 62nd Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Sicilia\\" to form the 62nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Sicilia\\". Afterwards the flag of the 62nd Jero was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags at the Vittoriano in Rome.

Life  Irene Dallas (born 1883) and her elder sister Hlida Mary Dallas (1878‚Äì1958) who was an artist, who was born in Japan to an English father who was a Ming dealer, but left them poor when he died, during their 20s. Hilda came to London to study art and the sisters became early members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the suffragettes, taking part in activist protest events, leading to prison sentences for Irene. Hilda designed posters for WSPU newspaper Votes for Women and its successor organisation. The sisters both boycotted the 1911 Census, whilst resident at 36 St George's Mansions, Red Lion Square as a protest at being counted by the British government whilst denied the right to vote for it. Later in life Hilda designed stage scenery and costumes, as well as illustrated books, and became a Christian Scientist.  Suffragette activism  Hilda Dallas was seen in a poster parade encouraging women to come to the demonstration at the House of Commons on 30 June 1908 with Dorothy Hartopp Radcliffe, Charlotte Marsh and Dora Spong in the strand earlier in June 1908. The image is in the Museum of London. Hilda Dallas (third from left) in poster parade in June 1908 Irene Dallas was studying maths whilst already in prison and the prison governor wrote, on 9 October 1908, to the Home Office, for permission for her to be sent an Algebra & Geometry and a Trigonometry book, as she was preparing for the Cambridge University entrance examinations. The governor remarked in his letter that 'A lady who runs the risk of imprisonment has presumably calculated that her action is of more importance to her than her prospects of getting into Cambridge.' However permission was given on the 'usual' understanding that the books would be 'donated to the prison library'. Hilda Dallas was an artist, involved in the Suffragette Atelier, from 1909, which trained and supported artists to create media in favour of women's suffrage. Hilda Dallas designed a poster for Votes for Women the WSPU publication, and later redesigned a poster featuring Joan of Arc when the paper became The Suffragette. Hilda Dallas trained at the Slade School of Art (1910‚Äì11). Hilda Dallas's poster for Votes for Women On 25 January 1909, Irene Dallas went in a taxi with Katherine Douglas Smith and Frances Bartlett to 10 Downing Street, after Lucy Norris and Mary Clarke had been turned away from seeing the Prime Minister, H.H.Asquith. Dallas and the others crossed a triple strength police cordon, asked to see the Prime Minister and, as with the earlier three women, had tried to 'force their way' in, and all were arrested, and imprisoned at Holloway alongside Constance Lytton who had refused to do that particular 'disagreeable job', and felt remorse later. Miss Dallas was the secretary to the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) fife and drum band which performed at a women's suffrage event at the Prince's Ice Rink in May 1909 and in following weeks played outside to 'inspire' hunger-striking suffragettes in Holloway Prison. Irene Dallas had a role in organising the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) protest procession in June 1910, and had colour co- ordinated the banners coming from different unions which can be seen along with the WSPU fife and drum band in films of the procession. At the 1911 Census, both sisters were marked as 'evaders', when women refused their legal duty to be counted in the population census as they viewed that they were not 'citizens', since being unable to vote. At Christmas 1912, both sisters were with Christabel Pankhurst in Paris. Hilda Dallas died in 1958, Irene Dallas's death is unknown.

Located along Dale, Ethan Allen, and Allendale Streets southwest of downtown Worcester, these buildings were built between 1910 and 1930, and are a stylistically diverse collection, including examples of Classical Revival, Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, and Craftsman architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Description and history The historic district is located southwest of downtown Worcester, and includes nine buildings located on Dale, Ethan Allen, and Allendale Streets, residential side streets located between Chandler and Main Streets. Three occupy most of the east side of Dale Street, with one on the west side. The other buildings line the northern block of Ethan Allen Street, with the two streets joined by Allendale Street. All are masonry structures, with most three stories in height. This area was originally the estate of gunmaker Ethan Allen, and it was subdivided by his heirs for development. The central portion of the estate, where his Greek Revival mansion had been located and these streets now run, was not developed until after the mansion was torn down, probably in the 1910s. Isadore Katz, a prominent real estate developer of the period, was responsible for two of the buildings on Dale Street, virtually identical buildings designed by Edwin T. Chapin. Morris Grossman, a Jewish immigrant, built the third building on the east side of Dale, with Chapin also credited with its design.

Construction began in spring 1944 shortly after the liberation of Crimea by the Red Army. Materials left from a unbuilt bridge of the occupying German forces were used by the Soviets in the construction of their bridge, Although it was opened for transport in autumn that year, construction was still incomplete, and December 1944 storms halted construction. By that time only part of the protective starkwaters were completed, and in February 1945 ice severely damaged the bridge, destroying the bridge pillars. Repair proposals were rejected and remnants of the bridge were disassembled afterwards.  History   Proposals for a bridge across the Kerch Strait  Proposals of the construction of the Kerch Strait bridge were considered as early as 1903. The bridge was supposed to be a part of a railway between Crimea and the Taman Peninsula. Two routes were considered, northern, from Yenikale to Chushka Spit, and southern, which was to cross Kerch Strait via Tuzla Spit. The northern variant allowed for usage of existing railway infrastructure and therefore was cheaper, but the railroad in this case would be longer and would have passed in the northern part of the Taman Peninsula, avoiding most economically developed areas of it. So the southern route was preferred, and in 1910 Tsar Nicholas II sanctioned geotechnical investigations on this route. The World War I and the Russian Revolution prevented construction from commencing. Not until World War II and the German invasion of the Soviet Union was the idea of a fixed link across the Kerch Strait taken up again. Following outbreak of the German‚ÄìSoviet hostilities in 1941, construction of a fixed link across the Kerch Strait gained new importance, to ensure stable supply of military units arose of both combatants. A ropeway construction by the German Organisation Todt (OT) started in 1942 and completed in June 1943. With a daily capacity of 1,000 tons, the ropeway just sufficed to meet the defensive needs of the German 17th Army. On 7 March 1943 Hitler ordered the construction of a combined road and railway bridge over the Strait of Kerch within six months, to push for the German invasion of the North Caucasus. Construction began in April 1943, but before it was completed, in September 1943 concentrated Soviet attacks began on the bridgehead, accelerating the German retreat. When retreating the Wehrmacht blew up the already completed parts of the bridge and destroyed the ropeway.Inside the Third Reich by Albert Speer, Chapter 19, p. 270 (1969, English translation 1970)  Soviet construction of a railway bridge  The Soviet Union, for its own part, closely monitored the state of transport infrastructure in German-occupied Crimea. Since June 1943, when Soviet intelligence learned that Nazi Germany was constructing a Kerch Strait bridge, information about it was allocated a special section in further intelligence reports. Soviet forces restored the ropeway and used it extensively to further the Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation. The Soviets also were interested in using a bridge: in January 1944, even before the liberation of Kerch by the Red Army (which would take place on 11 April, during the Crimean offensive), the State Defense Committee ordered the construction of a railway bridge across the strait, demanding that such bridge shall be ready by 15 July 1944. By the time of the liberation of Kerch the engineering design was underway and general construction had begun on the eastern adjacent roads and on the causeway on the Caucasus shore. 470 anti-air platforms, 294 anti-air guns, 132 searchlights, 96 fighters and two radars were involved in defence of the construction site from air attacks and their detection.–ö–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤ –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤. –í–æ–π—Å–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ–≤–æ–∑–¥—É—à–Ω–æ–π –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã. ‚Äî –ú.: –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, 1968. ‚Äî P. 269. To hasten opening of the bridge the construction works were divided into two stages, but the government-demanded deadline was impossible to accomplish. The construction took seven months, and the first train crossed the bridge on 3 November 1944. By that time only structures dedicated for the first stage were created, while to ensure protection of the bridge from storms and ice flows there was still much work to do. Severely worsened weather conditions in December 1944, and more frequent winter storms, prevented completion of construction, and also began to inflict damage on the fixed link itself. In particular, one violent storm propelled a barge towards the eastern causeway and destroyed it.  1945 ice damage and demolition  In February 1945 drift ice, propelled by a northeastern wind from the Sea of Azov towards the incomplete bridge, inflicted fatal damage, with only five protective starkwaters ready by that time. On 18‚Äì19 February 1945, ice destroyed 24 pillars and 26 spans (of 110) fell into the strait;–î–æ–∫–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–∫–æ–º–∞ –ø—É—Ç–µ–π —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –°–°–°–† –ò.–í. –ö–æ–≤–∞–ª–µ–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—é –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–∞ –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –°–°–°–† –ò.–í. –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω—É –æ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ö–µ—Ä—á–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–æ—Å—Ç–∞.

By March 1945, 46 pillars and 53 spans were destroyed, and 1016 piles of 2357 were severely damaged. Attempts to weaken the ice by artillery and ground-based ice blasting were ineffective, and aerial bombing of ice was impossible due to a very bad weather. Icebreakers were also unable to reach the bridge. The main reason of the failure was a lack of effective protection of the bridge, resulting largely from the wrong decision to allocate protective measures to a second stage of construction. Other construction (and design) errors contributing to a collapse of the bridge included inconsistency between small-span design and ice regime in that area of the strait, construction of the bridge with incomplete engineering inquiry (which resulted in wavering on the needed ice protection measures), and lack of technical, material and work-force supply of the construction. Much of this stemmed from hurried approach to the project, which also depended on the use of German leftovers from their incomplete bridge. Design errors meant that even if the bridge was repaired, a collapse similar to one that happened in February 1945 could recur. Coupled with a necessity of massive funding of potentially futile repair works, the proposals to repair the bridge were doomed. On 31 May 1945, the State Defense Committee deemed repair of the destroyed bridge unfeasible,State Defense Committee decision on the Kerch railway bridge taken on 31 May 1945 which meant demolition of its remnants.  Design  The bridge started at Chushka Spit as about -long stone dam, crossed the strait and ended at a low-level shore of the Yenikale Peninsula, between and . The bridge used piles up to long, the bridge was long and about wide, it had 111 -long ordinary spans, two movable -long spans and two movable -long spans. The movable spans were of a swing bridge design, rotating horizontally over two adjacent navigable shipping lanes in the strait. During the bridge construction, connected railways were constructed towards it from Sennaya on the Cacuasus shore, and from the on the Crimean shore. Railway links between Port Kavkaz and Sennaya and Port Krym and Kerch railway stations were also under construction: the first was to be a -long railway, the second one would be -long.  Legacy  The failure of the 1944-1945 bridge did not mean immediate abandonment of the idea of a fixed link across the Kerch Strait by the Soviet government; indeed, construction of a new, permanent two-purpose (combined road-rail) bridge was decreed in 1949, and preparatory work had already started two years earlier. But in 1950 construction was halted and the Kerch Strait ferry line was created instead. From that time, the bridge idea fell into hibernation for decades: while it was proposed to construct such a link in one form or another from time to time, it did not become a reality or even go beyond proposals. In 2014, some seven decades after the Soviet decision to build a railway bridge, the situation changed. By then the Soviet Union itself had dissolved and Crimea became separated from Russia not only geographically (by the Kerch Strait), but also by an international border, between Russia and the independent state of Ukraine. But in February and March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and, amidst international non-recognition of the annexation and worsened relations with Ukraine (which at that time was the only state with overland links to Crimea), decided to build twin permanent road and rail bridges across the Kerch Strait. Dubbed the Crimean Bridge by the Russian government, the link became operational for road transport in 2018, opened to passenger trains at the end of 2019, and commenced carrying freight trains in 2020.

The largest contributors to these cities becoming unlivable are the combined effects of climate change (manifested through sea-level rise, intensifying storms, and storm surge), land subsidence, and accelerated urbanization. Many of the world's largest and most rapidly growing cities are located along rivers and coasts, exposing these focal points of economic and cultural activity to natural disasters. As countries continue to invest people, assets, and infrastructure into these cities, the loss potential in these areas also increases.Sundermann, L., Schelske, O., & Hausmann, P. (2014). Mind the risk ‚Äì A global ranking of cities under threat from natural disasters. Swiss Re. Sinking cities must overcome substantial barriers to properly prepare for today's dynamic environmental climate.  Background and History   Development  The fundamental conditions that gave rise to ancient cities, like Mesopotamia, have long been debated by scholars. A number of theories have been presented, and to date, there is insufficient evidence to support a single root cause which led to the formation of cities. Agriculture, increased economic productivity, and superior social organization are often cited as key contributing factors that gave rise to these ancient cities, although there likely were other factors at play. Today, similar forces continue to be drivers behind the urbanization of the global population. The vast majority of sinking cities are located in coastal lowlands. These areas are particularly vulnerable to climate related hazards, but since ancient times, have also been preferred areas for human settlement. Soil fertility, availability of fresh water from rivers, accessibility due to flat topographical relief, and sea and waterways allowing for trade routes, have long made coastal plains valuable agricultural and economic resources. Throughout history, these areas have continued to develop, and today, are some of the most densely populated regions in the word. {  +Examples of Major Metropolises Located in Coastal Plains !City !Metro Population (in millions) - Tokyo, Japan 38.0 - Shanghai, China 23.7 - Cairo, Egypt 18.8 - Buenos Aires, Argentina 15.2 - Tianjin, China 11.2 - London, England 10.3 - Jakarta, Indonesia 10.3 - Bangkok, Thailand 9.3 - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 7.3 - Houston, USA 6.8 - Saint Petersburg, Russia 5.0 }  Causes  The growing physical risks to many coastal cities stem from a combination of factors relating to rapid urbanization, climate change, and land subsidence. Many of these ‚Äúnatural hazards‚Äù are largely anthropogenic in origin. In many cases, the fundamental aspects that lead to sinking cities become tightly interwoven, and over time, are increasingly difficult to resolve.  Urbanization  Global Population Urban vs. Rural For the first time in human history the majority of people live in urban areas. The United Nations estimates that approximately 68% of the world's population will be living in urban areas by 2050. Urbanization has vast implications including the urban planning, geography, sociology, architecture, economics, and public health of a region. The rate at which urbanization occurs is also important. Slower rates of urbanization allow city planners time to make thoughtful planning decisions. Once cities reach maturity, it can take decades for local governments to develop, fund, and execute major infrastructure projects to alleviate the issues brought on by rapid urbanization. In particular, some regions in Asia are currently experiencing unprecedented urban growth. Currently, the Asian urban population is increasing by 140,000 per day and is expected to nearly double from 1.25 billion in 2006 to 2.4 billion by 2030. The more troubling fact is that much of this growth is taking place along the coasts. In China, population growth in urban coastal locations was three times the national growth rate. Rapid increases in population growth challenge the carrying capacity of these urban environments often leading to mismanagement of natural resources. For sinking cities, the most common result has been over-extraction of groundwater ultimately resulting in land subsidence.  Climate Change  Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, global warming has coincided with world's urbanization. Climate change, a result of global warming, will impact all regions of the earth, however, its impacts are unlikely to be evenly dispersed. Low lying cities are especially prone to the most devastating effects of climate change. The risks posed by climate change will continue to grow into the next century, even if a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is achieved, due to the built-in momentum from previous emissions. Moreover, recent reports by the United Nations have shown that climate change may be accelerating rather than slowing down. The 2019 Emissions Gap Report confirmed that GHG emissions continue to rise, despite highly publicized political commitments. The report goes on to emphasize that countries must increase their nationally determined contributions threefold to remain below the 2¬∞C goal and more than fivefold to achieve the 1.5¬∞C goal. Coastal cities will bear the largest impacts of climate change due to their proximity to the sea. Storm surges and high tides could combine with sea level rise and land subsidence to further increase flooding in many regions. Oftentimes even recently completed infrastructure projects have not properly accounted for the rapidly changing climate. Asia's coastal megacities are particularly at risk as some cities' flood protections have been sited as inadequate for even 30-year flood events. = Sea-Level Rise = Although reports vary widely in predicting the height of sea-level rise in the future, IPCC estimates predict a 1-meter rise over the next century. Other reports consider the IPCC estimates to be far too low and suggest levels closer to 1.9 meters by 2100. Nevertheless, sea-level rise is an unavoidable reality. As sea-levels continue to rise, coastal cities face challenges of properly modeling and preparing for the increased storm surges brought on by tropical storms. = Intensifying Storms = Risks due to sea-level rise will only be compounded by intensifying storms. As the oceans continue to warm, tropical cyclone rainfall rates and cyclone intensities are likely to increase. Studies conducted by the NOAA also suggest a 2¬∞C increase in global temperatures will lead to a greater proportion of tropical storms that reach Category 4 and Category 5 levels. Hurricane Sandy, which was only a Category 3 storm, inflicted nearly $70 billion (2012 USD) in damages. Additionally, climate change may cause a change in the paths of tropical cyclones, bringing storms to places which have previously not had to contend with major hurricanes. These vulnerable areas are likely to be unaware and ill-prepared for the ever intensifying storms.  Land Subsidence  Interconnected Aspects of Sinking Cities Subsidence is the sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of the ground's surface with little or no horizontal motion. Land subsidence can have both direct and indirect repercussions for cities. Direct impacts are often in the form of structural damage to major infrastructure systems, including water management networks, buildings, and highways. Land subsidence also further adds to the growing risk of coastal flooding, and oftentimes, the net rate of subsidence exceeds that of sea-level rise. In Bangkok, the Gulf of Thailand is rising 0.25 cm per year, but the city is sinking at a far faster rate, up to 4 cm per year.D. Gray, ‚ÄúBangkok Sinking as Seas Rise,‚Äù Associated Press, October 30, 2007 This downward settlement significantly increases flood vulnerability which can ultimately lead to major economic damages and loss of lives. = Causes = Throughout the twenty-first century, as these cities continued to grow, fresh water became an ever more precious resource. Due to the dense populations along river deltas, industrial development, and relaxed or no environmental protections, river waters often became polluted. This has become an ever more common phenomena in coastal mega-cities, particularly in Asia. Many cities are unable to afford costly water treatment systems and are forced to rely heavily on groundwater. When groundwater is extracted from aquifers in the subsurface more rapidly than it is able to recharge, voids are created beneath the earth. As the ground is loaded, most often through increased development, the soil compresses and land begins to subside. Depending on the geology of the region, subsidence may occur rapidly, as in many coastal plains, or more slowly if large bedrock exists in a region. = Examples = Venice is often referenced as an example of a city suffering from subsidence, however, it is a relatively minor case with mostly historical origins. More serious, are the Asian metropolises with concentrations of millions of people living at or even below mean sea level.Baeteman, C. (1994). Subsidence in Coastal Lowlands Due to Groundwater Withdrawal: The Geological Approach. Journal of Coastal Research, 61-75. Some cities, such as Tokyo, have developed sophisticated techniques for measuring, monitoring, and combating land subsidence. But many other large cities (Hanoi, Haiphong, Rangoon, Manila, etc.), particularly in developing nations, have no record of their subsidence, which is far from under control. Many cities do not possess the resources necessary to conduct complex, and often expensive, geological, geotechnical, and hydrogeological studies required to accurately measure and model future land subsidence. {  +Subsidence in Coastal Cities !City !Mean Cumulative Subsidence in Period 1900-2013 (mm) !Mean Current Subsidence Rate (mm/year) !Maximum Subsidence Rate (mm/year) !Estimated Additional Mean Cumulative Subsidence Until 2025 (mm) - Jakarta, Indonesia 2,000 75 - 100 179 1,800 - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 300 up to 80 80 200 - Bangkok, Thailand 1,250 20 - 30 120 190 - New Orleans, USA 1,130 60 26 > 200 - Tokyo, Japan 4,250 ‚âà 0 239 0 } Mexico City is an example of a sinking city that is neither coastal nor low lying. The city was originally constructed by the Aztecs above a large aquifer in the 1300s. Subsidence was originally caused by the loading of large Aztec and Spanish structures. The city grew rapidly during the nineteenth century, and with it, so did the demand for water. By 1854 more than 140 wells had been drilled into the aquifer beneath Mexico City. Although the early cultures drew water from the same lakes and aquifers, they were merely 300,000 people as compared to the city's current population of 21 million. Today, the historic and densely populated city is rapidly sinking at varying rates between 15 - 46 cm/year. The city is also currently plagued with water shortage issues emphasizing a common positive feedback loop that exists within sinking cities.  Impacts   Economic  As cities continue to grow, fueled by global urbanization, countries will continue to invest additional resources to accommodate the growing populations. Every day, sinking cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters, many of which, are a critical component of their national economies', and some, of the global economy. While natural catastrophes cause average economic losses between US$60-100 billion annually, a single large-scale disaster can easily surpass this, as proven by Hurricanes Sandy and Maria. Numerous sinking cities throughout the world are becoming ever more exposed to natural disasters, many of which, do not have the financial means to prepare for the impending storms. In July and August, floods at high tide often near the subway level in Mumbai, clearly indicative of the impending climate dangers. One study put the cost to Mumbai of a 1-meter sea-level rise at US$71 billion. Ho Chi Minh City currently accounts for 40% of Vietnam's GDP and has become especially vulnerable due to rising sea-levels, land subsidence, and continued urbanization. Bangkok is also highly exposed to river flooding, as a major storm could have potentially massive impacts to the national economy. This was confirmed in 2011 when the Chao Phraya River flooded and losses amounted to around 10% of Thailand's GDP. Although many US cities are less exposed and better equipped to handle the impacts of climate change, in some cases, US cities are especially susceptible in terms of economic risk. In a study conducted by Zillow, the real estate firm found that a combined $882 billion worth of real estate would be underwater if sea-level were to rise by six feet. Furthermore, the estimate only accounts for sea-level rise and doesn't even consider the possibility of major storms or land subsidence. New York City alone accounts for approximately 8% of the United States GDP and has experienced costly storms within the past decade. Mega-projects, like The BIG U, have been proposed to help protect against future super storms and long-term sea level rise. However, major questions are being raised regarding the project's effectiveness and social responsibility.  Social/Ethical  Asian urbanization will be accompanied by a significant increase in the number of urban poor as migrants continue to move to cities in hopes of economic prosperity. One report by OECD examined the vulnerability of 130 major port cities to climate change and found that by 2070 approximately half of the total population threatened by coastal flooding would reside in just ten megacities, all but one located in Asia. Another report analyzed the 616 largest metropolitan areas home to 1.7 billion people and cover approximately US$34,000 billion of global GDP. The study found that flood risk threatens more people than any other natural catastrophe. The urban poor will bear a disproportionate burden of climate change risk as they are likely to settle in areas most prone to flooding. This has also been seen in many US cities as low income housing is typically situated in the flood zones. Hurricane Katrina, in New Orleans, disproportionately impacted low income and minority communities as the wealthiest communities are situated above sea-level, and thus, further protected from major storms. Highly impacted areas, such as Orleans Parish and the 9th Ward, predominately contain minority communities and therefore the impacts are unevenly dispersed. {  +Cities at Risk of Coastal Flooding, Ranked By exposed Population in 2070 !Coastal City !Exposed Population Estimate (millions) - Kolkata 14.0 - Mumbai 11.4 - Dhaka 11.1 - Guangzhou 10.3 - Ho Chi Minh City 9.2 - Shanghai 5.5 - Bangkok 5.1 - Yangon 5.0 - Miami 4.8 - Hai Phon 4.7 } In other countries, environmental refugees have become a particularly difficult problem for governments. In Bangladesh, rising sea-levels and resulting floods have caused many people to flee to cities in India. In the coming decades, as impending storms begin to damage large sinking cities, environmental refugees are likely to become a global phenomena.  Political  Sinking cities have even led some nations to make drastic political changes. Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is home to 10 million people and is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world. Almost half the city sits below sea-level, and some researchers believe if the subsidence issues continue to go unchecked parts of the city will be entirely submerged by 2050. Jakarta's environmental issues have become so dire that the Indonesian government has proposed the capital be moved from Jakarta to a yet-to-be-built city in Kalimantan. The move hopes to ease some of the inequality and growing population issues on Jakarta by relocating a large portion of the population to the new capital. The controversial move is not unprecedented, but is likely one of the first capital relocations to be driven by environmental forces.  Policy Development  In many cases, urban officials have been unable to manage the challenges associated with sinking cities. Although every city has specific issues, the following are common general barriers to urban adaptation: * Urban officials' lack of awareness regarding the magnitude and vulnerability of coastal flooding risk * The need to cope with immediate problems such as housing, transportation, and poverty * Financial constraints which limit infrastructure upgrades * Governance issues  Mitigation  The first step in mitigating the risks associated with sinking cities is raising awareness among citizens and city officials. Some of the vulnerabilities of sinking cities are unable to be controlled by engineering projects, like climate change, so it is essential that urban officials are aware of the risks and vulnerabilities posed on their region. This starts by conducting local and regional assessments that analyze city-level flood risks, and culminates in creating a long term resiliency plan for cities. At this stage, climate change can no longer be mitigated. International goals hope to reduce its impact throughout the twenty-first century, however, cities must design with climate adaptability in mind. = Land Subsidence = Other components of sinking cities are within the control of urban officials and can be successfully mitigated. The first step toward a successful subsidence mitigation strategy is measuring and understanding its root causes. Many different techniques are used today including optical leveling, GPS surveys, LIDAR, and InSAR satellite imagery. Ideally, a combination of techniques will be used to conduct the initial studies. Many cities have successfully implemented policies to reduce subsidence. In Tokyo, groundwater regulations were implemented in the early 1960s, and ten years later, subsidence came to a halt. Shanghai is another example of a city that successfully implemented a subsidence mitigation strategy. Shanghai implemented an active recharge technique, which actively pumps an equal amount of water back into the subsurface as water is extracted. Assuming the pumping rates are in balance with the recharge rates, this has been proven to be a successful strategy.  Adaptation  For many sinking cities, adaptation is a more realistic strategy as many of the feedback loops associated with urbanization are too strong to overcome. For most sinking cities, the largest challenge associated with adaptation often becomes cost. The cost of adaptation to climate change required by developing countries, mostly in Asia, is estimated by the World Bank at US$75-100 billion per annum. However, the United Nations adaptation fund remains pitifully under-resourced at US$18 million. For many countries, foreign assistance will be necessary to fund large adaptation projects. A major component of adapting to climate change is the installation of flood protections, warning systems/evacuation planning, and land use and spatial planning. Construction of large sea walls, dikes, and diversion channels, are underway in many cities, but these solutions often only limit damage and must be combined with warning systems and evacuation plans. Warning systems and evacuation plans are likely the only response in coping with large-scale disasters to avoid significant loss of life. However, as seen during Hurricane Katrina, evacuation is not easily executed, as residents are often unwilling to abandon their unprotected property. As previously discussed, flood risk remains the largest natural risk to sinking cities throughout the world. The need to regulate land use to reduce exposure to flood risk should be the highest priority of many governments. The Netherlands has implemented a country-wide program coined the \\"Room for the River\\" Programme, which aims to give the river more room to be able to manage higher water levels throughout the country. By allowing buffer space for rivers the flood naturally, sinking cities can reduce the risk of floods that impact the established built environment.

Though these gases are present \\"in virtually all meteorites,\\" in Meteorites and the early solar system, J. F. Kerridge & M. S. Matthews Eds. the Fayetteville meteorite has ~2,000,000 x10‚àí8 ccSTP/g helium, or ~2% helium by volume equivalent. In comparison, background level is a few ppm. The identification of gas-rich meteorites is based on the presence of light noble gases in large amounts, at levels which cannot be explained without involving an additional component over and above the well-known noble gas components that are present in all meteorites. History William Ramsay was the first to report helium in an iron meteorite, in 1895- not long after its first Earth sample, instead of via Solar observation. The use of decay products to date meteorites was suggested by Bauer in 1947, and explicitly published by Gerling and Pavlova in 1951. However, this soon resulted in wildly varying ages; it was realized excess helium (including helium-3, rare on Earth) was generated by radiation, too. The first explicit publication of a gas-rich meteorite was Staroe Pesyanoe (often shortened to Pesyanoe), by Gerling and Levskii in 1956. In family with the later Fayetteville, Pesyanoe's helium level is ~1 million x10‚àí8 ccSTP/g. Reynolds' publication of a \\"general Xe anomaly\\", including 129I decay products and more, touched off the subfield of xenology, continuing to today. The first publication of presolar grains in the 1980s was precipitated by workers searching for noble gases; PSGs were not simply checked via their gas contents. Lines of inquiry As unreactive components, they are tracers of processes throughout and predating the Solar System: Material age can be determined by relative exposure to direct solar and cosmic radiation (by cosmic ray tracks), and indirect creation of resultant nuclides. This includes Ar-Ar dating, I-Xe dating, and U to its various decay products including helium. The parent body of a meteorite can be traced in part via comparison of trace elements. That meteorites are fragments of asteroids, and conditions on such asteroids, were partially deduced from gas evidence. This includes meteorite pairing, the re-association of meteorites which had split before recovery. Meteorite, parent, and Solar System histories are indicated by tracer elements, including thermometry, a record of material temperature. * Presolar activity. in Meteorites and the Early Solar System, Kerridge, J., Matthews, M. eds. * A supernova thought to have preceded the Solar System. * The history of the Sun.

Her research investigates visual systems and camouflage.  Early life and education  Harris was born in Wolverhampton. She initially studied physics at Imperial College London and graduated in 1988. She moved to the University of Oxford for her doctoral studies and earned her Doctor of Philosophy degree under the supervision of Andrew J. Parker in 1992. Her doctoral research investigated the efficiency of binocular stereopsis. To do this she added binocular disparity noise to a stereogram and compared judgements of depths made by a human with those made by an ideal detector with the correct disparity. She demonstrated that human efficiency was low, particularly when depth profiles were not smooth. Career and research Harris joined The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in 1992, where she worked as a postdoctoral fellow for three years. In 1995 Harris was appointed a Lecturer in neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh. She moved to Newcastle University in 1998 where she was made an Associate Professor. In 2005 she joined the University of St Andrews as a Professor of Psychology. Harris studies visual systems; and in particular what environmental information a given visual system can process and how it makes use of the information. As part of this research Harris uses psychophysical, computational and behavioural approaches, which allow her to understand the processes that underlie human vision and how they connect to motor action. Her early work considered the accuracy of binocular judgements of the direction of motion. Through her work Harris looks to uncover countershading, a means by which animal species disrupt shape perception, how the brain perceives motion, shape and depth and different eye movements. Her studies of animal camouflage have included monitoring the three-dimensional camouflage of the caterpillar. In 2019 Harris and co-workers uncovered how the brain processes three- dimensional information; establishing that the brain separated motion signals into two distinct pathways as they move from the eye to the brain. These signals ‚Äì of which one arrives quickly and the other slowly ‚Äì allow for information to be extracted simultaneously from each pathway, and alert the visual system that there is a three-dimensional object. She has shown that people with lazy eye syndrome may be able to process fast three-dimensional motion. Harris looks to apply this understanding to situations where visual communication goes wrong. Alongside her work on animal camouflage and three- dimensional vision, Harris has investigate the relationship between visual sensory and visuo-motor behaviour during the training of elite athletes. In 2019 she was awarded a Leverhulme Trust grant to study how unusual patterns in complex visual environments may specifically stimulate the visual system.  Selected publications  Her publications include; * Guidance of locomotion on foot uses perceived target location rather than optic flow * Speed discrimination of motion-in-depth using binocular cues * Binocular vision and motion-in-depth  References  Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Vision scientists Category:Academics of the University of St Andrews Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh Category:Academics of Newcastle University Category:1967 births Category:Living people ","title":"Julie M.

Locatelli\\" () is an inactive tank battalion of the Italian Army based in Altamura in Apulia. Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the Armored Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 1 November 1975 the LX Armored Battalion of the Infantry Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\" was renamed 60th Armored Battalion \\"M.O. Locatelli\\". The 60th Locatelli was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the LX Tank Battalion \\"L\\", which had been formed by the XX Tank Battalion \\"L\\" in Italian Libya in December 1939. Equipped with L3/35 tankettes the LX battalion fought in the early stages of the Western Desert Campaign and was destroyed during the Battle of Sidi Barrani near Buq Buq by the British Western Desert Force. After World War II the LX Armored Battalion was reformed on 1 May 1960 as armored unit of the Infantry Brigade \\"Avellino\\". The Avellino was disbanded on 30 October 1965 and the LX battalion was transferred to the Infantry Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 60th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 4th Tank Infantry Regiment Lieutenant Giuseppe Locatelli, who had served in the I Tank Battalion \\"M\\" during the Italian invasion of Egypt and was killed in action on 19 November 1940 south of Sidi Barrani. Equipped with M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers the battalion joined the Motorized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". On 1 February 1979 the 60th Armored Battalion \\"M.O. Locatelli\\" ceded its two M113 armored personnel carrier equipped companies to the infantry battalions of the brigade and received two new tank companies. Consequently the battalion was renamed on the same date 60th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Locatelli\\". Additionally the battalion was equipped with modern Leopard 1A2 tanks and the brigade's infantry battalions were equipped with VCC-1 armored personnel carriers. Therefore, on 1 February 1979 the brigade was renamed Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". On 17 October 1992 the 60th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Locatelli\\" was renamed 133rd Tank Regiment without changing size or composition. On 9 October 1995 the 31st Tank Regiment in Bellinzago Novarese received the war flag and name of the 4th Tank Regiment and transferred its own name and war flag to the 133rd Tank Regiment in Altamura, while on the same date the war flag of the 133rd Tank Regiment was transferred to the army's Tank School in Lecce, where it was stored in the commander's office, until, in case of war, the personnel of the Cavalry School would have formed the 133rd Tank Regiment. On 3 December 1996 the Pinerolo, which fielded now two tank regiments, was renamed: Armored Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\". In fall 2001 the 133rd Tank Regiment was disbanded and its war flag transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

Ediciones de la Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha Cuenca, 2008. (2008) page 144. The character was heavily inspired by Andre Franquin's Gaston Lagaffe, indeed it is somewhat of a merge between him and Spirou (the latter because of the bellhop uniform). Some of the first pages are almost identical of ones of Gaston Lagaffe. That similarity was reduced in 1966 with the introduction of a new original character, the Director (el Dire), who received orders from the President (el Presi). The dynamic of the series also changed, as it was usually the President being harmed by the consequences of Sacarino's actions and ideas, with the Director being mistakenly blamed for them (Sacarino still maintained the sympathy of the readers, because his gaffes were unintentional and because the Director was very despotic with his employees). The strips were then two pages long. In 1973, Sacarino became the main character of the magazine T√≠o Vivo.

History This land was first acquired by the War Department during the First World War; by 1917 it was serving as an Air Acceptance Park with an aerodrome attached. After the war, in 1922, the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) took over the site and buildings to serve as its Mechanical Transport Depot. The following year Feltham House, on the northern edge of the site, was purchased to serve as an officers' mess. (Believed to have been built in the 1770s for the Villebois family, the house (then known as Feltham Place) passed through several owners, serving for a time as a boys' school before being bought by 'Cabbage King' Alfred Smith in 1897.) It is a Grade II listed building with interiors designed or influenced by James Wyatt. It continued in use as an officer's mess through the 20th century (and was extended in the 1960s); however, as of 2018, it is unoccupied and has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. By the 1930s barrack blocks were laid out in rows to the south of Feltham House, while large industrial-type sheds to the east and further south were served by a set of tramlines linked to the mainline railway. The easternmost part of the site was (and remains) in use as playing fields. By the time of the Second World War the site was designated No. 1 Vehicle Reserve Depot; it also housed the RASC's Mechanical Transport Stores Depot and Mechanical Transport Heavy Repair Shop, as well as the RASC Driving School.Monthly Army List, August 1939 Feltham continued to serve as a Central Vehicle Depot (CVD) and Central Ordnance Depot (COD) of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps after the war (the RAOC having taken over responsibility for vehicle storage from the RASC in 1942). In 1962 part of the site was taken over by military intelligence as a facility specialising in the gathering and analysis of cartographic data. The closure of CVD Feltham was announced in 1969 and in 1970 COD Feltham was redesignated as an Ordnance Support Unit (OSU). In the 1970s the tramways were removed and a sizeable area to the south of the site was sold for redevelopment. OSU Feltham closed in 1996. In the 21st century the site remained in use as the Defence Geographic Centre (DGC) 'its primary role [being] to provide land maps, aeronautical charts, positional information, geo-referenced imagery and digital data in [various] formats for UK defence planning, operations and training'. The Defence HUMINT Organisation (DHO) was also based at Feltham. In 2012 DGC had a (largely civilian) staff of 400; its library included a global collection of over 700,000 maps, charts and atlases. DHO had 350 personnel, drawn from across the three services. In 2016 MOD Feltham was earmarked for disposal by the MOD, with an expected closure date of 2023.

It is known from a single species, Kwanasaurus williamparkeri. Kwanasaurus had a deeper, stronger skull and greater specialization for herbivory compared to other silesaurids. It also possessed many unique characteristics of the snout, ilium, and lower part of the femur. It was described along with new specimens of Dromomeron from the Eagle Basin, the northernmost extent of the Chinle Formation.  Discovery  Kwanasaurus hails from Triassic deposits in the Eagle Basin surrounding the town of Eagle, Colorado. This area contains the most northern exposures of the Chinle Formation, which is famous for its Late Triassic fossils of dinosaurs and other reptiles. Tentative terrestrial reptile biostratigraphy estimates that the Eagle Basin fossils, which were preserved in red siltstone, belong to the Revueltian biozone of the mid to late Norian stage of the Triassic, 215-207 million years ago. The holotype of Kwanasaurus is a partial silesaurid maxilla, DMNH EPV.65879. All other silesaurid maxillae recovered from the area seem to represent the same taxon, indicating that Kwanasaurus was likely the only silesaurid from the Eagle Basin. With this in mind, all other Eagle Basin fossils resembling those of silesaurids have been referred to the taxon. These include multiple dentaries, teeth, ilia, femora, and a humerus. Dinosauromorph-like tibia and scapulae from the area may also belong to Kwanasaurus, though they have not been referred to the genus due to lacking any clear silesaurid features. Kwanasaurus was named in a 2019 paper by Jeffrey W. Martz and Bryan J. Small, along with the description of new Dromomeron material. The genus name incorporates kwana, the Ute name for eagle. The specific name commemorates paleontologist Bill Parker.  Description   Skull  Maxillae, including the holotype, DMNH EPV.65879, A-H The maxilla is much deeper and more robust in Kwanasaurus than in any other silesaurid. There are replacement pits on the inner edge of the tooth row similar to those of thyreophorans, and smaller and more numerous pits on the outer surface of the maxilla. Five of the replacement pits at the midlength of the bone are set in a groove, a trait also present in Silesaurus and silesaurid skull material from the Ntawere Formation. The front of the maxilla is similar to that of Lewisuchus and Silesaurus, with a triangular premaxillary facet and thick, sharp vomerine flange. The ascending process of the maxilla is a thin, anteroposteriorly wide, and steeply-rising prong, and the antorbital fossa has a concave lower edge, both like Silesaurus. The inner surface of the maxilla has a thick medial flange, which droops down to the tooth row as a smooth triangular blade. This medial flange is unique to Kwanasaurus among silesaurids (and Triassic dinosauromorphs in general), and likely extended the maxilla's connection with the palate behind the vomer. The rear portion of the holotype maxilla is characteristically complex and similar to that described for Plateosaurus. These complex traits include a posterolateral flange which likely shielded part of the jugal, a pair of deep dorsomedial grooves (likely articulating with the lacrimal and jugal), and a broad groove behind the medial flange which likely articulated with the palatine. DMNH EPV.63136, the most complete referred dentary Lower jaw bones referred to Kwanasaurus include DMNH EPV.63136, one of the most complete dentaries found for any silesaurid. As in other sulcimentisaurians, the meckelian groove is positioned close to the lower edge of the jaw and the teeth are constricted at the root. The front tip of the dentary is pointed, toothless, and has a lateral groove akin to that of Silesaurus and Sacisaurus, along with several medial grooves. Further back, the dentary is relatively deep and develops a lateral ridge similar to one reported for Diodorus and Eucoelophysis. The pattern of pitting and holes on the outer surface of the dentary also resembles those taxa. The tooth row is edged by a medial groove connecting a series of replacement pits; above the groove the bone is inset similar to the case in Silesaurus, Eucoelophysis, and Technosaurus. Kwanasaurus is the only silesaurid to preserve data on the mandibular fenestra. This hole in the jaw was triangular, edged from below by a posteroventral process of the dentary which also overlapped a partial angular. The dentary's posterodorsal process is sharp along its upper edge and notched along its lower edge.  Teeth  Teeth of Kwanasaurus have been found both as isolated material and within maxillae and dentaries. Isolated teeth are leaf-shaped, with coarse denticles, slightly flattened sides, and crown tips more than halfway towards the rear of the tooth. The lingual (tongue) side of the tooth has a thick vertical ridge covered in striations. Sacisaurus, Eucoelophysis, and possibly Technosaurus are the only other silesaurids known to possess similar teeth, although leaf-shaped teeth are also common in various other herbivorous archosaurs. In some of the maxilla, the teeth are short and swollen (almost round in cross section) and become smaller towards the rear of the bone. The dentary teeth are similar but more asymmetrical. The middle of the dentary has the largest and most denticulate teeth in the jaw. There are 12 maxillary teeth and 14 dentary teeth. These teeth extend further back in the skull than most silesaurids, as is the case in Lewisuchus, but they are not as numerous as those of that taxon. Like other silesaurids, Kwanasaurus has ankylothecodont tooth implantation, meaning the teeth are set in sockets but also fused to the surrounding bone. At least in the maxilla, Kwanasaurus has a complex pattern of tooth replacement. This pattern involves replacement teeth being formed along the lingual edge of the tooth row, shifting outwards (at which point the original tooth's attachment dissolves and the tooth detaches), fusing to the leftover socket and leaving behind a replacement pit. The tooth row has alternating empty and full sockets, indicating that adjacent teeth were never replaced at the same time. This contrasts with Silesaurus and Technosaurus (which sometimes have several adjacent teeth replaced at once), but resembles the condition in some specimens of Sacisaurus, Diodorus, and Asilisaurus.  Forelimbs  DMNH EPV.59302, the referred humerus A long and slender humerus is the only forelimb bone safely assigned to Kwanasaurus, based on its similarity to that of Silesaurus and Diodorus. The proximal portion is slightly expanded, but the humeral head is not as thick or straight as that of other silesaurids. Unlike dinosaurs (but in line with other silesaurids), the deltopectoral crest is small and extends less than a third down the length of the shaft. The distal portion of the humerus is simple and barely expanded, twisted relative to the proximal portion (similar to Silesaurus), but also with a groove running up its anterolateral surface (similar to Diodorus).  Hip and hindlimbs  DMNH EPV.48506, the most complete referred ilium Large referred proximal femora, including DMNH EPV.125924 (A-E) The hip is only represented by the ilium, which had a low, saddle-shaped upper blade like silesaurids such as Silesaurus, Eucoelophysis, and Ignotosaurus. It also resembles these taxa in its elongated and expanded preacetabular process. Kwanasaurus takes this trend further, lengthening the preacetabular process so that it projects further forwards than the pubic peduncle, an adaptation otherwise only seen in several lineages of dinosaurs among dinosauromorphs. The postacetabular process is large and possesses a well-developed brevis shelf and brevis fossa, traits standard for sulcimentisaurians. Like many basal dinosauromorphs, the brevis shelf merges with the edge of the acetabulum and the rear edge of the postacetabular process has a small pointed extension. The acetabulum is deep and has a very thin and concave lower edge. This contrasts with other silesaurids, which have a straight lower edge to the acetabulum, and instead may suggest a partially perforated acetabulum akin to that of dinosaurs. The inner surface of the ilium has several facets for the sacral ribs. The second facet is twice as long as the first and may have encompassed two sacral ribs, suggesting that Kwanasaurus possessed three sacral vertebrae. Referred distal femur DMNH EPV.67956 Multiple femora of various sizes and conditions have been referred to Kwanasaurus. The femoral head was similar to that of other advanced silesaurids, according to several traits. These include a longitudinal groove on its upper surface, a straight (rather than rounded) articular facet on the medial surface, a distinct notch on its underside, and an overall triangular cross section due to the lack of a distinct posteromedial tuber. Directly below the head extends a ridge known as a dorsolateral trochanter. Adjacent to it is the anterior trochanter, a pronounced vertical crest characteristic of dinosauriforms (and a few Dromomeron specimens). The crest was blade-like, triangular, and straight- edged, proportionally most similar to Silesaurus among dinosauriforms. Only one femur referred to Kwanasaurus (DMNH EPV.125924) possessed additional muscle attachment structures such as a trochanteric shelf and a swelling that likely represented the iliotrochanteris caudalis attachment site. Asilisaurus and Silesaurus are the only other silesaurids with trochanteric shelves, and its development is sometimes considered to be related to skeletal maturity. However, the largest Kwanasaurus femur (DMNH EPV.34579) lacks a trochanteric shelf, despite its presence in the smaller 125924 specimen. All specimens had a low fourth trochanter, sometimes edged by an anterior depression as in Sacisaurus and Diodorus. The distal portion of the femur possessed several unique features. The medial condyle was a sharp flange, notably thinner than the lateral condyle and crista tibiofibularis. This is similar to lagerpetids but in contrast to the broader medial condyle of all other silesaurids. Kwanasaurus also possesses a characteristic depression on the distal surface of the femur, in front of the crista tibiofibularis. Nevertheless, the notably deep and extensive sulcus present between the medial and lateral condyles is in line with that of other silesaurids.  Classification  Kwanasaurus was added into a phylogenetic analysis to test its relationship to other silesaurids. The codings for the taxon were based on both all the Eagle Basin silesaurid material as well as the dinosauromorph tibiae and scapulae which may additionally belong to it. The strict consensus tree (average result of all most parsimonious trees) was poorly resolved, with practically all silesaurids in a polytomy along with ornithischians and sauropodomorphs. The adams consensus tree (in which unstable taxa cluster at the base of the smallest group they are always within) has better resolution. In this tree, the highly unstable Ignotosaurus shifts to a polytomy with dinosaurs and other silesaurids, while Silesauridae starts with Lewisuchus at the base, followed by Soumyasaurus and Asilisaurus, and finally a clade containing all other silesaurids. This clade was named Sulcimentisauria by the authors of the paper. Removing Ignotosaurus, Soumyasaurus, and Technosaurus led to higher resolution within Silesauridae. Kwanasaurus was found to be the sister taxon to the other North American taxon, Eucoelophysis. Here is the consensus cladogram (specifically the portion focusing on dinosauromorphs) after the removal of the three unstable taxa:  Paleoecology  Kwanasaurus was the northernmost and youngest silesaurid found in North America. Its short, leaf- shaped, and heavily denticulated teeth were adapted for eating plants, a trait shared by several other advanced silesaurids. This diet represents the culmination of a series of adaptations within Silesauridae, starting with carnivory in Lewisuchus (evidenced by recurved and finely serrated teeth), leading to omnivory and/or insectivory in Asilisaurus and Silesaurus (conical teeth with few serrations), and eventually the evolution of a specialized herbivorous diet in advanced sulcimentisaurians. Kwanasaurus in particular had robust skull bones ornamented with ridges, indicating that it likely fed on tougher plants than other herbivorous silesaurids. The timing of silesaurid dietary evolution mirrors the acquisition of herbivory in sauropodomorph dinosaurs, which diversified in southern and eastern portions of Pangea in the Norian stage. The absence of herbivorous dinosaurs in the Chinle Formation may indicate that they had not yet colonized the northwestern region of Pangea that would eventually become North America. This would leave herbivorous niches available for other amniotes, explaining the diversity of non-dinosaur herbivores in the Chinle Formation. These include allokotosaurs (Trilophosaurus), pseudosuchians (Revueltosaurus, aetosaurs, and shuvosaurids), and dicynodonts (Placerias). Kwanasaurus was one of the silesaurids that was a part of this Norian herbivore guild, along with its relative Eucoelophysis (which lived in further south in New Mexico).

It was founded as a retail chain, but subsequently branched out into real estate and other fields. History Alon Blue Square dates back to 1932, when it was founded as the Tel Aviv Cooperative Consumer Association. This and other cooperative consumer clubs were run by the Consumer Cooperation Union, in turn run by HaMashbir HaMerkazi. In 1970, all grocery store clubs formed a union, owing to the desire to unify grocery prices across the country for unionized workers. In 1972, the Tel Aviv club merged with the clubs from the Sharon region, Ashkelon and Beersheba. Later in the decade, the unified group became called Co-Op The Blue Square, with Benny Gaon appointed as its executive director. The group had a revenue of 2.5 billion Israeli pounds. In 1987, the company became the Israeli franchisee of Wendy's, reaching six branches, but failed. The cooperative founded a new business in 1991, called Co-Op Blue Square Consumer Cooperative Society Limited, in which it held an 82% stake. At the time, the company employed about 3,000 workers. The company expanded its reach significantly in the 1990s, founding the Super Center supermarket chain. It also operated the Hamashbir Lazarchan, bought and the Home Center hardware and household goods chain, had plans to sell Dunkin' Donuts in the Co-Op branches, and it owned the franchise rights for operating IKEA in Israel, but was forced to sell them. In the 2000s Blue Square operated Sbarro and Pelephone stands in its stores and it also founded the Mega chain, geared toward its Buy and Bonus club members. In 2002, Blue Square entered the online retail business, with the Blue Center brand. In 1996 the cooperative's holdings and the for-profit company merged into Blue Square Israel, and had a public offering in New York under that name. In November 2000 it also had a public offering in Israel. This privatization was initiated by various members of the cooperative, who had been forced to buy its shares decades earlier, but largely weren't invested in its ideology. By the 1990s they had wanted to sell their shares on the free market, and this was only possible through privatization. In 2002, most of the members voted to dismantle the company and sell its assets. In 2003, Blue Square Israel was purchased by Alon Group, owner of the energy company Dor Alon, for billion, and became Alon Blue Square. In 2015, Alon Blue Square encountered financial difficulties. The Mega supermarket chain owned by the company went into receivership, and the latter became insolvent. In 2016, Alon Blue Square was fully acquired by Moti Ben-Moshe and became a private company. In December 2019, Alon Blue Square acquired the Gindi family's 50% stake in TLV Fashion Mall, a shopping mall in Tel Aviv, for million, making it the sole owner of the property. Holdings and subsidiaries Alon Blue Square has two main subsidiaries: the energy company Dor Alon, and Blue Square Real Estate. Other than these, the company full or partially owns multiple retail chains, including Mega Home, Na'aman, Vardinon and others. It also has holdings in the radio station 103fm. Prior to 2015, the company also had holdings in the retail chains Doctor Baby (owned by Mega) and Kfar HaSha'ashu'im, the mobile virtual network operator YouPhone the local Diners Club franchise, and the Israel Post newspaper.

According to the author, \\"not traditional bronze or granite, but white marble was chosen, as it is living, semitransparent material; this monument is not an obelisk, but a boulder, boulder in motion, such as Boris Nikolayevich was.\\"  History  The monument was opened on February 1, 2011, on Yeltsin's 80th birthday. The Third President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev arrived to Yekaterinburg for birthday celebrations and participated in the opening ceremony. When opening the monument, which he liked, Medvedev noted, that \\"Russia must be grateful to Yeltsin for the country not leaving the way of changes in the most difficult period, conducted serious transformations and moves forward today\\". The ceremony was also attended by Yeltsin's widow Naina Iosifovna, his relatives and friends, representatives of federal government, Sverdlovsk oblast head Alexander Misharin, and heads of neighboring regions. Opening of the monument caused protests of the local communists, while city authorities declined the rally against the opening. This resulted in Union of Comunist Youth representatives' suing against the Yekaterinburg administration.  Monument Vandalism  On the night of August 23 to 24, 2012 the monument was vandalised by unidentified individuals: the figure of Yeltsin was doused with blue paint, letters on the pedestal were dislodged. Attempts to wash the monument in its place were unsuccessful, resulting in the decision of its dismantling. On October 1, 2012, after restoration works, the monument was returned back to its place. On November 7, 2017 (on the day of centennial of October Revolution) Igor Shchuka tried to set the monument on fire. For this act, he was sentenced to 1 year of manual labour in February 2018. After the sentence Shchuka managed to hide for almost a year, but then the oblast court cancelled the decision \\"due to a scintilla of evidence\\".(2019).

It is based on the joint-operation of communication and electricity systems. Commelec has been developed by scientists at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, a research institute and university in Lausanne, Switzerland. The Commelec project is part of the SNSF‚Äôs National Research Programme ‚ÄúEnergy Turnaround‚Äù (NRP 70).  Motivation  Due to penetration of a large amount of distributed generation, modern power systems are facing numerous challenges such as the absence of inertia, stochastic power generation, grid stress and stability issues. This could lead to problems related to power balance, power quality, voltage and frequency control, system economics and load dispatch. The conventional distribution grid was not designed to support the distributed generation of electricity. Therefore Commelec framework is developed in order to guarantee a proper grid operation under these challenges without major grid reinforcements. It can provide both primary frequency control and secondary voltage control, being also capable to operate in islanded mode. In contrast to conventional droop- control, it keeps the equilibrium point without using the frequency as the main indicator of power imbalance.  Principle of Operation  Commelec is an agent-based framework. The grid agent (GA) is a piece of software that is running on an embedded computer attached somewhere in the grid. It monitors the state of the grid through the measurement system and orchestrates different resources by speaking to resource agents (RAs) that are usually collocated on the inverters of the resources. While GAs are smart and take part in computing decision actions, RAs are simple-minded, merely requested to send information about their internal state in a specified and universal format.  Device-independent Protocol for Message Exchange  Every 100 ms, RA sends a device-independent representation about its internal state to the GA. On receiving this information from RAs through a communication network (e.g. internet), GA solves robust multi-objective optimization problem (taking into account the constraints of the grid), takes local decisions and implements them. Correction of decisions can be done after receiving new advertisements from RAs. The information that GA receives from RA has pure mathematical abstract description. It consists of: * PQ profile: A convex set \\\\cal A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^2 that contains all the possible power setpoints (P,Q) that RA can implement, * Virtual cost: A continuously differentiable function CF: \\\\cal{A}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R} characterized by the preference of the resource to stay in a certain zone of PQ profile, * Belief function: A set-valued function BF:\\\\cal{A}\\\\rightarrow 2^{\\\\mathbb{R}^2}which captures uncertainty in resource operation due to nature and local inverter control. Requested setpoint (P,Q) for RA to implement and actually implemented setpoint (P',Q'), in general, can be different. By definition, (P',Q')\\\\in BF(P,Q)\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^2.  Composability  Power network can be organized in a flat setting where single GA controls the whole grid and leads all the RAs, and in the hierarchical setting in which GA can lead not only RAs, but also the GAs with lower hierarchy level. Composability property that Commelec provides, enables aggregation of several resources that GA controls to a single entity (i.e. virtual resource) which can be further controlled by a GA with a higher hierarchy level. Such virtual resource uses the same language to advertise internal state to its leading GA which makes the control problem scalable.  Experimental Validation  The performance of Commelec control framework is evaluated through a case study composed of a replica of CIGR√â‚Äôs low-voltage microgrid benchmark TF C6.04.02. This microgrid, built at EPFL, consists of different types of resources such as photovoltaic plants, battery energy storage systems and electric heaters. For real-time monitoring, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are used.

Refugee Activism  Ahmed moved to Finland in 1990 with her husband and youngest child and shortly after began work as a volunteer interpreter to assist Somali refugees, lecture on Somali culture and give interviews to journalists to enable people to understand the backgrounds that many Somali refugees were arriving from. Civil war had broken out following the fall of dictator Siad Barre and Hargeisa was bombed. Ahmed's other children remained with relatives but some later moved to Finland. The first place they stayed at was the Joutseno Reception Center, from where they eventually moved to Vantaa. During her time in Finland, Ahmed worked hard to advocate for the rights of refugees, especially women and children, and for Somali cultural understanding. This work led to her being named as the Finnish Refugee Council's 'Refugee Woman of the Year' in 2005. In 2011, Ahmed's biography was published: In Search of Peace - Amran Mohamed Ahmed's Story.  Writing Career  During her time in Finland, Ahmed wrote poetry and journalism, in Somali and Finish. Her creative works include fairy tales and she has been involved in editing the collection of poems, Nine Autumn Sessions (University Press2002). Her poems have been published in various collections of poems. Ahmed has broadcast on Somali-language family radio for years. She has also published on the theme of Somali-ness. In 2007, Ahmed moved to London where she works as a journalist for the Somali-based Raad TV International and continues to write and publish poetry.  Early Life  Ahmed was born in Hargeisa into a family with two children. Her father, Mohamed Ahmed Muse, worked for the British army at the time, as Somalia was a British colony. Ahmed attended school in her hometown and studied in the capital Mogadishu. She later made educational materials for the Somali Ministry of Education. Ahmed had five children from two marriages.

Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the Motorized Brigade \\"Friuli\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 23 September 1975 the XIX Armored Battalion of the Infantry Brigade \\"Friuli\\" was renamed 19th Armored Battalion \\"M.O. Tumiati\\". The 19th Tumiati was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the XIX Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had been formed by the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment on l February 1942. The battalion, equipped with M15/42 tanks and Semoventi 75/34 self-propelled guns, fought German forces, which tried to occupy Piombino on September 10 1943, two days after Italy had switched sides with the Armistice of Cassibile. After the battle for Piombino the battalion retreated to the countryside and destroyed its tanks, before the personnel dispersed. After World War II the XIX battalion was reformed in Florence in 1959 as armored unit of the Infantry Brigade \\"Friuli\\". Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 19th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment Second Lieutenant Francesco Tumiati, who had served in the Western Desert Campaign in 1941-1942 and joined a partisan unit after the German occupation of Italy in 1943. After 8 months as commander of a partisan detachment Tumiati was caught by German forces and executed on 17 May 1944. Equipped with M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers the battalion joined the Motorized Brigade \\"Friuli\\".

He was Premier of the Bougainville Transitional Government from April 1995 until his death. Professional career Miriung was born at Poma village in the Kieta district of Bougainville and was educated at the Tunuru Catholic Mission and at Chabai. He studied for the priesthood at the St Peter Chanel seminary in Ulapia for three years from 1966, but then left the seminary and went to work for mining company CRA Exploration. Miriung studied law at the University of Papua New Guinea from 1969 to 1973 and was admitted to the bar in 1974. He briefly ran a private legal practice in Arawa in 1976 and then joined the public service, rising through the ranks as provincial legal officer and then provincial secretary in Bougainville and then Chief Land Titles Commissioner for Papua New Guinea. He was appointed an acting National Court judge in 1988. In 1991, he advised the Bougainville Revolutionary Army on their planned Bougainville Interim Government, and was often reported to have been a \\"legal adviser\\" to the rebels. He left in February 1992 after a dispute, but reportedly remained in contact with the rebels. Peace process and Premiership As a figure with ties to both sides of the Bougainville Civil War, Miriung became an influential figure in attempts 1994 to reach a peaceful solution to the war, attending the Arawa Peace Conference and being involved in the establishment of a \\"peace zone\\" in North Nasioi. In November 1994, Miriung and Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea Julius Chan signed the Mirigini Charter, establishing a Bougainville Transitional Government to replace the North Solomons Provincial Government that had been suspended in 1990. The Assembly of the transitional government met in April 1995, and on 10 April elected Miriung as Premier of the Bougainville Transitional Government. Miriung was a key moderate figure in peace negotiations between the PNG government and the BRA, but faced challenges on both sides: the BRA dismissed the BTG as a \\"puppet government\\", while the PNG Government suspected Miriung of working with the BRA and restricted his movements at times. He differed with the PNG Government on a resolution to the conflict, condemning their attempts to end the war through a military offensive and extrajudicial killings, while supporting a more expansive concept of autonomy than the national government, eventually coming out in support of an eventual referendum on independence months before his death. Shortly before his assassination, Papua New Guinean defence minister Mathias Ijape blamed Miriung for a BRA attack on PNG soldiers and called for his resignation as Premier. Minorities at Risk Project, Chronology for Bouganvilleans in Papua New Guinea, 2004, available at: https://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38ca17.html [accessed 8 December 2019] Assassination On 5 October 1996, Miriung travelled from the government's base at Buka to visit his family at Siwai. A week later, on 12 October, Miriung,was assassinated at the age of 55 while having dinner with his family in his wife's village of Kapana. He was reported to have been killed at close range by at least two assassins, with an autopsy finding six wounds in his back from automatic gunfire and one major wound from a shotgun blast. Miriung's killing was condemned by Chan and Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer and numerous other figures. His assassination removed a key figure from the peace process: United Press International wrote at the time that he was \\"seen by many to offer the greatests hope for peace on the strife- torn island\\", while peace process worker Alan Weeks later wrote that Miriung \\"could have been the Nelson Mandela of Bougainville. Investigations into responsibility The Papua New Guinea Defence Force and the BRA initially traded allegations of responsibility for the killing. A Commission of Inquiry was held under retired Sri Lankan judge Thiruvukkarasu Suntheralingam, which found in December 1996 that the murder was committed by several members of the PNGDF in conjunction with their allies the Siwai Resistance. Suntheralingam requested that police investigate further and prosecute six people, but this did not occur. Sections of the report were released publicly, but the full report, including the specific identities of Miriung's alleged killers, were never released, and Miriung's family never received a copy. The assassination remained a long-simmering issue during the Bougainville peace process, which inhibited progress at various times. In November 2019, with the 2019 Bougainville independence referendum drawing international attention to Bougainville, Miriung's family called for the release of the full report and the naming of those responsible. Sam Akoitai, the member for Central Bougainville in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea, raised the issue in parliament, and Prime Minister James Marape pledged to further investigate the issue. In December 2019, Miriung's eldest son Justin stated that the family believes that some figures from the national government were involved in his murder.Amnesty International, Amnesty International Report 1997 - Papua New Guinea, 1 January 1997, available at: https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a9fc38.html [accessed 8 December 2019] References Category:Bougainvillean politicians Category:Assassinated Papua New Guinean politicians Category:1996 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Theodore Miriung"},{"id":"62534986","text":"Omar Abdullah Al-Dahi (Arabic: ÿπŸÖÿ± ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÑÿ∂ÿßÿ≠Ÿä; born in 15 December 1999), is a Yemeni professional football player who plays for the Yemeni national team.

Life and career Bruce Harris was born in Ireland and trained as a journalist in England in Middlesbrough and Birmingham before joining the Evening Standard in London in 1920 and turning his attention to sport.\\"Obituary\\", The Cricketer, Winter Annual 1960, p. 500.John Kay (ed.) Cricket Heroes, Phoenix Sports Books, London, 1959, p. 188. At first he specialised in tennis, but in 1932 the Evening Standard chose him ahead of his younger colleague E. W. Swanton, a cricket expert, to cover the forthcoming English cricket tour of Australia. He was the first journalist ever to have been sent on an overseas cricket tour by an individual newspaper.E.W. Swanton, Sort of a Cricket Person, William Collins, London, 1972, pp. 17‚Äì19. On the voyage to Australia, Douglas Jardine, England's captain on the 1932-33 tour, was planning his bodyline tactics, which he knew would be controversial. Harris was learning how to be a cricket writer. They soon won each other's confidence.David Frith, Bodyline Autopsy, ABC Books, Sydney, 2002, p. 57. Harris supported Jardine's tactics throughout the tour, and when the tour finished he wrote his first book, Jardine Justified, for which Jardine wrote a grateful foreword.Frith, p. 343. Arthur Mailey, the former Australian Test player, while deploring the closeness between Jardine and Harris, thought Jardine Justified full of \\"interesting and well-written passages\\" and better than most tour books. The reviewer for the Brisbane Telegraph noted that apart from the behaviour of the cricket crowds Harris evidently enjoyed Australia and wrote about it enthusiastically. The reviewer for The Age noted that the book included \\"several entertaining chapters relating to matters other than cricket\\". This \\"other-than-cricket\\" journalism became a feature of Harris's tour books. Of his book on the 1936-37 tour of Australia and New Zealand, the New Zealand Herald's reviewer wrote that between accounts of the matches Harris records \\"his journalist's impressions of Australia and its institutions. Gambling, life-saving on the beaches, hotel-closing, and immigration are discussed. Many a good story enlivens his pages.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer of Harris's book on the 1946-47 tour praised his ability to rise above the partisanship that often mars cricket journalism, and said, \\"he is an agreeable companion in these pages, in which he shows that he has an eager capacity for observing the life and people around him as he passed [sic] from place to place\\". The Sydney Daily Telegraph reviewer of the same book devoted most of his review to an appreciation of Harris's chapter on Australia's liquor licensing laws. Harris was the first journalist to accompany five touring English cricket teams to Australia, beginning with the 1932-33 tour and ending with the 1954-55 tour. He wrote a book about each Australian tour, as well as several about Test series in England in the 1950s. Harris was the secretary of the Cricket Writers' Club soon after its founding in 1947 and later served as the club's chairman. He died at his home in Ealing after a long illness, aged 73.

It was a reaction to a broader trend of tyranny that had swept through Athens and the rest of Greece. Background According to legend, Athens was formerly ruled by kings, a situation which may have continued up until the 9th century BCE. During this period, Athens succeeded in bringing the other towns of Attica under its rule. This process of synoikismos ‚Äì the bringing together into one home ‚Äì created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility. From later accounts, it is believed that these kings stood at the head of a land- owning aristocracy known as the Eupatridae (the 'well-born'), whose instrument of government was a Council which met on the hill of Areopagus and appointed the chief city officials known as archons. The archon was the chief magistrate in many Greek cities, but in Athens there was a council of archons which exerted a form of executive government. From the late 8th century BCE there were three archons: the archon eponymos (chief magistrate), the polemarchos (commander-in-chief), and the archon basileus (the ceremonial vestige of the Athenian monarchy).Gods, Heroes and Tyrants: Greek Chronology in Chaos By Emmet John Sweeney. The archon eponymous was the chief archon, and presided over meetings of the Boule and Ecclesia, the ancient Athenian assemblies. The archon eponymous remained the titular head of state even under the democracy, though with much reduced political importance. In 753 BCE the perpetual archonship by the EupatridaeHerodotus, George Rawlinson, Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson.

Appleton, 1882. Pg 316 were limited to 10 year terms (the \\"decennial archons\\").Evelyn Abbott. A Skeleton Outline of Greek History: Chronologically Arranged. Pg 27. After 683 BCE the offices were held for only a single year. Bust of Solon, democratic reformer in Athenian Antiquity By the 7th century BCE, social unrest had become widespread, as Athens suffered a land and agrarian crisis. Many Greek city-states had seen the emergence of tyrants, opportunistic noblemen who had taken power on behalf of sectional interests. In Megara, Theagenes had come to power as an enemy of the local oligarchs. His son-in-law, an Athenian nobleman named Cylon, himself made an unsuccessful attempt to seize power in Athens in 632 BCE. However, the coup was opposed by the people of Athens, who forced Cylon and his supporters to take refuge in Athena's temple on the Acropolis. Cylon and his brother escaped, but his followers were cornered by Athens' nine archons. They were persuaded by the archons to leave the temple and stand trial after being assured that their lives would be spared. In an effort to ensure their safety, the accused tied a rope to the temple's statue and went to the trial. On the way, the rope broke of its own accord. The Athenian archons, led by Megacles, took this as the goddess's repudiation of her suppliants and proceeded to stone them to death. Megacles and his genos, the Alcmaeonidae, were exiled from the city for violating the laws against killing suppliants. In order to restore order, the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft strict new laws, replacing the system of oral law with a written legal code enforced by a court of law. However, these \\"Draconian\\" reforms ultimately failed to quell the conflict. Reform and revolution Reform In 594 BCE, Solon, premier archon at the time, issued reforms that defined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens who owned property, Solon reshaped the social framework of the city-state. Under these reforms, a council of 400 members (with 100 citizens from each of Athens's four tribes) called the boule ran daily affairs and set the political agenda. The Areopagus, which formerly took on this role, remained but subsequently carried on the role of \\"guardianship of the laws\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Areopagus. Another major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an Ecclesia or Assembly, which was open to all male citizens, regardless of social class. The Alcmaeonids were also allowed back into the city, during the archonship of Solon.See Gomme, A Historical Commentary on Athens, on 1.126.12. Megacles' son Alcmaeon held command during the first Sacred War: Plutarch, Solon 11.2. Eventually the moderate reforms of Solon, improving the lot of the poor but firmly entrenching the aristocracy in power, gave Athens some stability. For many of the years to come, the nascent democracy even managed to govern itself without an archon. Statue of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, assassins of the tyrant Hipparchus Democracy however was threatened by tyranny, as several political factions began to vie for control of the Athenian polis. Peisistratos launched a populist coup and seized the reigns of government in Athens, declaring himself Tyrant. Upon his death, Peisistratos was succeeded to the tyranny by his sons Hippias and Hipparchus, the latter of which was murdered by the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton. Hippias executed the tyrannicides and it was said that he became a bitter and cruel ruler, executing a large number of citizens and imposing harsh taxes on the Athenian populace. Hippias's cruelty soon created unrest among his subjects. As he began losing control, he sought military support from the Persians and formed alliances with other Greek tyrannies. The Alcmaeonidae family of Athens, which Peisistratus had exiled in 546 BCE, was concerned about Hippias forming alliances with the Persian ruling class, and began planning an invasion to depose him. In 510 BCE Cleomenes I of Sparta successfully invaded Athens and trapped Hippias on the Acropolis. They also took the Pisistratidae children hostage forcing Hippias to leave Athens in order to have them returned safely. Hippias was one of several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Themistocles, Demaratos, Gongylos or Alcibiades. Revolution With the tyrant ousted, the Spartan king installed Isagoras at the head of an oligarchy, made up of Athenian aristocrats that were loyal or sympathetic to Sparta. He found himself opposed by the majority of Athens, particularly the middle and lower classes, who desired a return to democracy. Cleisthenes, of the pro-democracy Alcmaeonidae clan, was expelled from Athens by the Spartan-backed oligarchs, leaving Isagoras unrivalled in power within the city. Isagoras set about dispossessing hundreds of Athenians of their homes and exiling them on the pretext that they too were cursed by the Alcmaeonidae miasma, he also attempted to dissolve the Boule. However, the council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support for the council and revolted against the oligarchy. Cleomenes, Isagoras and their supporters were forced by regular citizens to flee to the Acropolis, where they besieged by Athens' populace for two days. On the third day the Athenians made a truce, allowed Cleomenes and Isagoras to escape, and executed 300 of Isagoras' supporters. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and he was elected the first archon of a democratic Athens.Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 20 Modern bust of Cleisthenes, known as \\"the father of Athenian democracy\\". Cleisthenes began to institutionalize the democratic revolution. He commissioned a bronze memorial from the sculptor Antenor in honor of the lovers and tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton, whom Hippias had executed. In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the tyranny in the first place, he changed the political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations and which formed the basis of the upper class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their deme,) which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure.Aristotle, Politics 6.4. Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics in favour of demonymics (a name given according to the deme to which one belongs), thus increasing Athenians' sense of belonging to their local community, thus completely undermining the rule of aristocratic families. He also established sortition ‚Äì the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity. He also introduced the bouletic oath, \\"To advise according to the laws what was best for the people\\".Morris & Raaflaub Democracy 2500?: Questions and Challenges The court system and the Boule were also reorganized and expanded. It was now the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed or returned for amendments by the assembly. Cleisthenes also may have introduced ostracism (first used in 487 BCE), whereby a vote by a plurality of citizens would exile a citizen for 10 years. The initial trend was to vote for a citizen deemed a threat to the democracy (e.g., by having ambitions to set himself up as tyrant). However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much power in the city tended to be targeted for exile (e.g., Xanthippus in 485/84 BCE).Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Chapter 22 Under this system, the exiled man's property was maintained, but he was not physically in the city where he could possibly create a new tyranny. One later ancient author records that Cleisthenes himself was the first person to be ostracized.Aelian, Varia historia 13.24 The Spartans thought that a free and democratic Athens would be dangerous to Spartan power, and attempted to recall Hippias from Persia and re-establish the tyranny. Democratic Athens sent an embassy to Artaphernes, brother of Darius I, looking for Persian assistance in order to resist the threats from Sparta. Artaphernes asked the Athenians for \\"Water and Earth\\", a symbol of submission, if they wanted help from the Achaemenid king. The Athenians ambassadors apparently complied with this request, but then Artaphernes advised the Athenians that they should receive back Hippias, threatening to attack Athens if they did not accept him as their tyrant once more. Nevertheless, the Athenians preferred to remain democratic despite the danger from the Achaemenid Empire, and the ambassadors were disavowed and censured upon their return to Athens. Soon after this, the Ionian Revolt began. It was put down in 494 BCE, but Darius I of Persia was intent on punishing Athens for its role in the revolt. In 490 Hippias, still in the service of the Persians, encouraged Darius to invade Greece and attack Athens; when Darius initiated the campaign, Hippias himself accompanied the Persian fleet and suggested Marathon as the place where the Persian invasion of Attica should begin. But never again would the Peisistratids have influence in Athens. Democracy and counter-revolution Painting depicting the Athenian politician Pericles delivering his famous funeral oration in front of the Assembly. In 462 BCE, the pro-democracy Ephialtes and his political allies began attacking the Areopagus, a council composed of former archons which was a traditionally conservative force. According to Aristotle and some modern historians, Athens had, since about 470 BCE, been governed under an informal \\"Areopagite constitution\\", under the leadership of the aristocrat Cimon.Kagan, The Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 64-5. See also Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, The Areopagus had already been losing prestige ever since 486 BCE, since when archons were selected by lot. Ephialtes accelerated this process by prosecuting certain members for maladministration.Unless otherwise noted, all details of this campaign are drawn from Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, Having thus weakened the prestige of the council, Ephialtes proposed and had passed in the popular assembly, a sweeping series of reforms which divided up the powers traditionally wielded by the Areopagus among the democratic council of the Boule, the ekklesia itself, and the popular courts. Ephialtes took away from the Areopagus their \\"additional powers, through which it had guardianship of the constitution.\\" The Areopagus merely remained a high court, in control of judging charges of murder and some religious matters. At the same time or soon afterwards, the membership of the Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship.Thorley, J., Athenian Democracy, Routledge, 2005, pp. 55‚Äì56 The success of Ephialtes' reforms was rapidly followed by the ostracism of Cimon, which left Ephialtes and his faction firmly in control of the state, although the fully fledged Athenian democracy of later years was not yet fully established; Ephialtes' reforms appear to have been only the first step in the democratic party's programme.Hignett, History of the Athenian Constitution, 217-18 Ephialtes, however, would not live to see the further development of this new form of government; In 461 BCE, he was assassinated, succeeded to the democratic leadership by Pericles.Plutarch, Pericles, 10.6‚Äì7 In the wake of Athens' disastrous defeat in the Sicilian expedition in 413 BCE, a group of aristocrats took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading the city to ruin. Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional channels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400, in the Athenian coup of 411 BCE. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by an even more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404 BCE, when the government was placed in the hands of the so-called Thirty Tyrants, who were pro-Spartan oligarchs. After a year pro-democracy elements regained control, and democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II conquered Athens in 338 BCE.https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/48.html See also * Athenian Democracy * Classical Athens References Category:History of Athens ","title":"Athenian Revolution"},{"id":"62535379","text":"The 15 Khordad Foundation () is one of the organization created in 1982 on the orders of Rouhollah Khomeini that intend to fix the economic issues of the families of martyrs, veterans, and founders of the Revolution.

Along the miracle mile. Honolulu Star-Bulletin. p. 2-3. before moving to territorial Honolulu in 1940. There he began working for C. G. Benny as an engraver and jeweler, and quickly established himself in Honolulu's burgeoning art scene. Studying at the Honolulu Academy of Arts School, he presented his work in Academy-sponsored shows, exhibitions and demonstrations throughout the war years. Boyer opened his first studio on Fort St. in downtown Honolulu in 1952. He was an active member of Hawai\`i's craft and art community, teaching courses in jewelry at the Honolulu Academy of Arts School and supporting fellow craftspeople through his role in the Hawaii Craft Association, where he served as president and vice-president. Boyer Jewelers opened on Ke\`eaumoku St. in 1956. Here he continued to produce hand-wrought pieces while developing original designs for the growing tourist market in Hawai\`i. He created a series of charms replicating classic Hawaiian artifacts from the Bishop Museum and used his engraving skills to produce a line of Hawaiian heirloom jewelry. He created lines for both men and women working primarily in silver accented with black coral, baroque pearls, and local woods. Individual pieces in gold and other metals using precious and semi precious stones met the tastes of individual clients. As a small business owner he developed a collaborative business model, selling in a variety of Honolulu venues, and supporting the work of apprentices and those he mentored.

In the 1990s Boyer returned to his original love of sculpture. Spending several months a year traveling throughout the US and in Canada, he created works on two scales. Enchanted by the craftsmanship and design of Japanese netsuke, he carved dozens of small wearable art pieces in ivory and wood. An equal number of larger scale works in stone reflected his interest in abstract shapes and complex curves, as well as a lifelong interest with animal forms.  Style  As both an artist and a designer-craftsman, Boyer is solidly situated within the themes and approaches of the modernist studio jewelry movement. Ebony pearl and silver pendant, 1955. Walker Art Center, exhibit on paper.Schon, Marbeth (2008). Form and Function: American Modernist Jewelry, 1940-1970. Atglen, PA: Schiffer. Although he worked primarily in silver with baroque pearl, ebony, native Hawaiian woods and coral, his early creations display a wide range of techniques, metals and materials. He explored inventive techniques in free-form construction as well as production work. Displaying artistry and experimentation he would create pieces out of found materials (polished rock, ceramic pieces, and shells) as well as at-hand materials. An early example can be found in the collection at the Honolulu Museum of Art. This 1944 brooch, a simple circular form, was crafted from airplane plastic, brass and copper. Later he invented techniques and tools for working with lost wax casting, metals and other materials. The sculptural shapes of his work illustrate movement and shape, light and space. Whimsical themes and kinetic movement also find their place in pieces designed for wear- ability and function. Producing affordable jewelry as wearable art, as well as that of viewing jewelry making as a fine art in its own right, can be seen in his lines of jewelry for both men and women. His men's sets display a minimalist approach and eye for functionality. Boyer produced his designs and craftsmanship that secured his inclusion among modernist studio jewelers.

Chris Evans is an American actor who made his film debut in Biodiversity: Wild About Life!, a 1997 educational film co-produced by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, before making appearances in minor television roles in the early 2000s. Evans has described his filmography of the early to mid 2000s as being \\"really terrible\\". He appeared in the television comedy-drama Opposite Sex (2000), comedies Not Another Teen Movie (2001) and The Perfect Score (2004), and the action thriller Cellular (2004). In 2005, Evans had his breakthrough performance as Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the superhero film Fantastic Four, his highest-paid role at the time, and reprised the role for the film's 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Fantastic Four would be the first of many roles in films adapted from comic books and graphic novels for Evans, including Casey Jones in TMNT (2007), Jake Jensen in The Losers (2010), Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and Curtis Everett in Snowpiercer (2013). His most prolific comic book movie role would be as Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) series of films, with credited appearances and cameos as the character in eleven films and one video game; notable appearances include the headlining films Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and Captain America: Civil War (2016), and the ensemble films The Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). While comic book films formed the bulk of Evans's filmography from the late 2000s through the entirety of the 2010s, he concurrently acted in a range of non-comic book projects, including Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Sunshine (2007), Marc Webb's drama Gifted (2017), and a critically acclaimed performance in Rian Johnson's Knives Out (2019). He also starred in several romantic comedy films, including The Nanny Diaries (2007), What's Your Number? (2011), and Playing It Cool (2015), the latter of which he also executive produced. Evans made his directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama Before We Go, which he also produced and starred in. His Broadway debut was in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play Lobby Hero, for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award.

Viewing ratings for the ceremony fell to a twelve-year low, peaking at 3.5 million, though being the most-viewed show in the UK after 22:00. The ratings drop may be a result of the broadcast delay, with many live news outlets publishing the results before they were televised and revealed on television. Discussions about the lack of diversity within the award nominations surrounded the ceremony, with the host referring to it as \\"the year when white men finally broke through\\". He also described eleven-time nominee Joker as \\"essentially the story of a white man who makes himself even whiter\\". Best Director presenter (a category of all-male nominees) Rebel Wilson joked about the absence of females in the category, quipping \\"Honestly, I just don't have the balls\\". Best Actor in a Leading Role winner Joaquin Phoenix used his speech to comment on the \\"systemic racism\\" of the BAFTAs and acting industry in general. Speaking ahead of the ceremony, BAFTA chairwoman Pippa Harris addressed her frustration in the lack of recognition for female directors, as well as the issues around diversity as a whole. In his closing speech to the ceremony, BAFTA president Prince William had prepared a speech discussing the issue, saying that \\"a wide-ranging review of the whole awards process\\" was underway and that lack of diversity \\"simply cannot be right in this day and age\\". 1917 was the night's biggest winner, winning seven prizes in total of its nine nominations, including Best Film and Best Director (Sam Mendes), despite not having any acting nominees and thus becoming a favourite for the then upcoming 92nd Academy Awards; it lost to Parasite. Mendes became the first British winner to win Best Director in eleven years. Since votes for the Academy Awards must be registered two days after the BAFTA Awards, Screen Daily noted that 1917 would be a safe choice for Academy members, who are averse to streaming films based on 1917s marketing as a \\"must-see on the big screen\\". This compares to the Netflix film The Irishman being the night's biggest loser, taking no awards despite ten nominations; Netflix productions in total received twenty-three nominations, winning only two: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Best Animated Film (Klaus). Screen Daily also suggested that there is anecdotal evidence of Netflix not supporting its nominees as much as it did last year for Roma (2018). The writers of Screen Daily additionally suggested that there was some controversy surrounding the British identity of some films nominated for Outstanding British Film; 1917 is financed by the US, and Retablo is a Peruvian film co-produced with Norway and Germany, whose Peruvian director‚Äî√Ålvaro Delgado-Aparicio‚Äîonly lives in London. The ceremony also marked the first year since the 30th British Academy Film Awards (1977) in which there were no British acting winners. Wins marking diversity were Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Bait, a film described by its writer-director as \\"a black and white, 16-millimetre, hand- processed, post-synced film in Academy ratio about Cornish fishing people\\"; Best Documentary for For Sama, a personal story of bombings at a Syrian hospital made by the family involved, with them using their speech to \\"implore the UK not to ignore the ongoing plight of the people of the Syrian city of Idlib\\"; and the Rising Star Award for Micheal Ward, star of Rapman's Blue Story (which received no nominations), who used his speech to say that he \\"feels like we're going in the right direction\\" in terms of diversity. Best Actress in a Leading Role winner Ren√©e Zellweger noted in the press room that she felt like part of \\"the British gang\\"; after accepting her award, Hugh Grant had taken to the stage to present, quipping \\"well done Jones\\" as Zellweger left, a reference to their roles in the British film Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). Later in the press room, the young Sama Al-Kateab, who had been held by her parents on stage while accepting Best Documentary, was allowed to roam and took to running the length of the stage and playing with microphones. With his fifth win for Best Cinematography for 1917, Roger Deakins becomes the most-decorated BAFTA winner in the category. Collecting his BAFTA, he said: \\"I think it was George Orwell that said all films are special but some films are more special than others, and for me this was a really special film\\". The recent Brexit was also mentioned, appearing in Brad Pitt's acceptance speech for Best Actor in a Supporting Role delivered by co-star Margot Robbie; Pitt's speech also noted that he would name his award \\"Harry\\" because he's going to take it to the United States.

Prior to being hired at Arkansas, he was the associate head coach and offensive line coach at the University of Georgia. Prior to his hiring at Arkansas, Pittman had spent almost his entire career ‚Äì going back to the mid-1990s ‚Äì as an offensive line coach at various college football programs.  Playing career  Pittman was born in El Reno, Oklahoma. Sam's father, Don, moved the family to Grove, Oklahoma, because Grove High School had better recruiting prospects. Pittman, a multi-sport athlete in high school, attended Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas. He played defensive end at Pittsburg State from 1980 to 1983 and in his senior year was named a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) All-American. Pittsburg State inducted him into their Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998. In 1981, Pittman's sophomore year, Pittsburg State went 10‚Äì2 and lost the NAIA Division I Championship. Head coach Ron Randleman parlayed this success into the head coaching job at Sam Houston State University. His successor at Pittsburg State was defensive coordinator Bruce Polen, who had recruited Pittman in high school. Pittman accompanied Polen on several recruiting trips while still a student; in 2020 Polen would reflect on Pittman's natural affinity for recruiting:  Coaching career   High school  Following his graduation from Pittsburg State, Pittman spent two years there as a student assistant coach before becoming offensive coordinator at Beggs High School in Beggs, Oklahoma, for the 1986 season. Following that stint Pittman served as head coach for Princeton Junior-Senior High School in Princeton, Missouri, from 1987 to 1988, and Trenton High School in Trenton, Missouri, from 1989 to 1990.  College assistant  In 1991, Pittman was hired as the offensive line coach at Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kansas. The following year he was named head coach, replacing Glenn Percy. Pittman compiled an 11‚Äì9‚Äì1 record over two seasons. Pittman was credited with reviving a \\"struggling\\" program. Northern Illinois hired Pittman as its offensive line coach in February 1994. Then-head coach Charlie Sadler described Pittman as \\"one of the top up-and- coming offensive line coaches in the country.\\" Sadler was fired after the 1995 season, and Pittman moved over to the University of Cincinnati, joining Rick Minter's staff as tight ends coach. Other coaches on that staff included future NFL head coaches Rex Ryan (defensive coordinator) and John Harbaugh (assistant head coach). Pittman left Cincinnati after the 1996 season to become the offensive line coach at the University of Oklahoma under second- year coach John Blake. Rex Ryan followed Pittman to Oklahoma after Blake reshuffled his coaching staff at the end of the 1997 season. Oklahoma fired Blake after the 1998 season and Pittman moved over to Western Michigan University to join Gary Darnell's staff, again as offensive line coach. At the end of 1999 Pittman and offensive coordinator Bill Cubit departed Western Michigan to take up the same positions at the University of Missouri under Larry Smith. Missouri fired Smith at the end of the 2000 season; Pittman moved over to the University of Kansas under Terry Allen. Allen had reshuffled his coaching staff following a disappointing 4‚Äì7 season in 2000; in 2001 team went 3‚Äì8 and Allen was fired. Pittman returned to the coaching ranks in 2003 as the offensive line coach at Northern Illinois, the same job he had held in 1994‚Äì1995. The head coach was Joe Novak, who had replaced the fired Sadler after the 1995 season. Northern Illinois promoted Pittman to assistant head coach for the 2004 season. Pittman departed Northern Illinois after the 2006 season to join new University of North Carolina head coach Butch Davis' staff as offensive line coach. Pittman was considered a potential head coach at Northern Illinois after Jerry Kill, Novak's successor, departed for the University of Minnesota after the 2010 season. Davis was dismissed before the 2011 because of an academic scandal; Pittman was considered for the interim head coach job which eventually went to Everett Withers. After the conclusion of the 2011 season Pittman took the offensive line coach job at the University of Tennessee under Derek Dooley. Not the first time, Pittman was added to a coaching staff that had been just reshuffled because of poor performance. Tennessee fired Dooley at the end of season, and Pittman joined new University of Arkansas head coach Bret Bielema's staff as assistant head coach/offensive line coach, where he spent the 2013 through 2015 seasons. Pittman departed Arkansas after the 2015 season to become offensive line coach at the University of Georgia under new head coach Kirby Smart and offensive coordinator Jim Chaney, whom Pittman had previously worked with at both Tennessee and Arkansas. Georgia paid a $250,000 buyout to hire Pittman. When Pittman informed Bielema that he planned to take the Georgia job, Bielema brought several Arkansas offensive linemen to Pittman's house in an attempt to convince him to remain at Arkansas. Bielema claimed that Pittman had refused to meet personally with his players to inform them he would be leaving, a claim that Pittman denied. At Georgia, Pittman garnered a reputation as \\"one of the best recruiters and offensive line coaches in the SEC.\\" In his second season, Georgia won the SEC Championship Game and reached the College Football Playoff National Championship. That was the first of three consecutive Southeastern Conference East Division titles for Georgia from 2017‚Äì2019. Pittman's 2018 line was named a finalist for the Joe Moore Award for the best offensive line in college football. Pittman was promoted to associate head coach in 2019, with a salary of $900,000 per year making him the highest-paid offensive line coach in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Off the field, he became known for a catchphrase, \\"Yessir!\\", that he would use in social-media videos posted after Georgia secured commitments from significant recruits, beginning with quarterback Justin Fields in 2017.  Head coach  On December 8, 2019, Pittman was announced as the new head coach at Arkansas, replacing Chad Morris, who was fired midway through his second season. Other candidates for the position reportedly included Lane Kiffin and Mike Leach. Several of Pittman's former players lobbied for him to get the job, including writing an open letter to Arkansas administrators shortly after Morris's firing. Pittman's hiring was announced on Twitter by athletic director Hunter Yurachek, including a video of Pittman and Yurachek yelling Pittman's trademark \\"Yessir!\\" Personal life Sam is married to his wife, Jamie. Pittman is close friends with his former colleague Rex Ryan. Ryan (who according to Pittman is \\"not handy\\") once flew Pittman out to his home to help build a children's fort that Ryan had designed: Head coaching record  Junior college   College Notes References * External links * Arkansas profile Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Arkansas Razorbacks football coaches Category:Cincinnati Bearcats football coaches Category:Georgia Bulldogs football coaches Category:Hutchinson Blue Dragons football coaches Category:Kansas Jayhawks football coaches Category:Missouri Tigers football coaches Category:North Carolina Tar Heels football coaches Category:Northern Illinois Huskies football coaches Category:Oklahoma Sooners football coaches Category:Pittsburg State Gorillas football coaches Category:Pittsburg State Gorillas football players Category:Tennessee Volunteers football coaches Category:Western Michigan Broncos football coaches Category:High school football coaches in Missouri Category:High school football coaches in Oklahoma Category:People from El Reno, Oklahoma Category:Players of American football from Oklahoma Category:Sports coaches from Oklahoma ","title":"Sam Pittman"},{"id":"62535638","text":"The Hoffmantown Baptist Church, at 2335 Wyoming Blvd. NE, in a suburban area in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. The Hoffmantown Baptist Church was established in 1953, and in that year built a one-story brick chapel. The church grew quickly, and built an addition in 1954, a fellowship hall in 1956; and an educational building in 1959. It commissioned Kruger, Lake and Henderson architects in 1965 to design a larger sanctuary that could accommodate 800 persons. This is the building that is now listed on the National Register. The main building on the site was built in 1965, with New Formalist style, and is roughly three stories tall. Its north-facing main facade, on Phoenix Avenue, has six colossal tapered pilasters. The five bays of the facade are covered with a veneer of small blue tiles, and include vertically staggered windows. The longer east facade, along Wyoming Avenue, has a similar pattern of windows and one-story pilasters which support a reinforced concrete brise soleil. The east side also has an open- frame bell tower which was built in three stages. The Hoffmantown Baptist Church kept growing, and began a television ministry in 1972 which continues, in 2019, to broadcast throughout New Mexico. During the early 1980s, membership grew to 2,200, and a capital campaign raised funds to build a new, larger church at Ventura and Harper Streets. This was built in 1986‚Äì87. Separately, another Albuquerque church, God's House Church, originally named The House of God, was growing. It was founded in 1916, and built a new church on Arno Street in 1959. God's House Church purchased the entire Wyoming Blvd. campus of the Hoffmantown Baptist Church, and in 1997 opened at this location with 900 members. The larger campus including the church also has four one- and-two-story plain brick buildings, which are the earlier buildings of the Hoffman Baptist Church built between 1953 and 1968.

August 23, 1893) was a professional violinist from Viggiano, Basilicata, Italy, who, in early Johannesburg, South Africa, rose to fame in the 1910s as one of the most talented violinists in the country.Stage & Cinema, March 31, 1917, Vol. IV. No.87 He adjudicated many competitions for promising musical students. As an acclaimed soloist and orchestral leader he performed in various locations in Southern Africa between 1907-1932 to audiences in large halls, tearooms and bars, social events and Eisteddfods. Early life Francesco was the fifth child of Giuseppe Ferramosca (b. November 11, 1850) and Agnese Mariarosa Miraglia (b. January 19, 1858, m. June 8, 1879). Apart from two children that died young, he and his three remaining siblings were all talented musicians in Viggiano. He started learning the violin at age six and very soon showed promise. However after some years he contracted tuberculosis and his health deteriorated. It was then that his father decided to bring him to South Africa, known for its dry climate and TB facilities. The family had contacts with a number of Italian musicians in Johannesburg, so Giuseppe brought Francesco and his brother Nicola to Johannesburg around 1907 to seek treatment for him. Amongst his contacts were Sr. Galeffe, a cellist, and Sr. Lorenzo Danza, a pianist. Francesco was left in their charge, and his father and brother returned to Viggiano. Career Whilst receiving treatment, Francesco continued to study violin. In those days, Johannesburg resembled an overgrown mining camp with very few large buildings surrounded by ordinary houses. There was little work outside of the mines and almost nothing for a young musician. Francesco was reduced to playing in the streets for a few pennies, but that proved to be the start to his career. Around 1911, a renowned overseas music trio consisting of the three Cherniavsky brothers, Alex (violin), Leo (cello) and David (piano), were touring South Africa. They saw Francesco performing on Eloff Street, and were so impressed at his tone and virtuosity, they spent months giving him more training and polishing up his technique. This eventually led to Francesco joining a trio with Sr. Lorenzo Danza on piano and Reuben Goldberg on cello. The trio became very popular, and played in venues throughout The Reef, Pretoria, and in neighboring Louren√ßo Marques (now Maputo), Mozambique,Teatro Scala as well as socialite weddings.The Leven Advertiser and Wemyss Gazette, July 18th, 1912 Orchestra Ferramosca at The Waldorf Cafe, Cape Town, 1925 During one of his concerts, he met Doris Gwendoline Helliwell, an accomplished concert pianist, who thereafter accompanied him on various occasions. Francesco married Doris (m. January 11, 1916) and they had two boys, Joseph Frederick Lorenzo (\\"Genzie\\") Ferramosca (b. May 17, 1916, d. January 3, 2007), and Frank Eugene (\\"Chickles\\") Ferramosca (surname changed to Mitchell) (b. January 21, 1921, d. March 14, 2003). The trio played regularly at Johannesburg's Balcony Tea RoomStage & Cinema, May 12, 1917, Vol. IV. No.93 (later to become The Corner Lounge) on the first floor of the Cuthberts building. In the following years, the trio expanded to an orchestra of seven (\\"Orchestra Ferramosca\\"), with Francesco as leader, and were regular performers at The Corner Lounge. The orchestra also played frequently at The Lounge, Madeleine's and Gloria. By 1920 Francesco was recognized as the finest violinist in the country. In June 1924, he left with his family for a short tour of Italy S.A. Pictorial, June 21, 1924 S.A. Pictorial, July 5, 1924, and a benefit concert for him was arranged by an \\"influential committee\\", with a \\"highly attractive musical programme\\" S.A. Pictorial, June 21, 1924. In 1925 he and his orchestra were offered a regular position at the Waldorf Cafe, Cape Town Cape Times and decided to relocate with his family to Mouille Point. While in Cape Town, he performed with the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra on a number of occasions. After three years, he returned to Johannesburg in early 1928, where he performed with the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and played evenings at the O.K. tea room and finally at Rondi's. The orchestra was the first to broadcast from a tea room, having a regular half-hour slot on the local SABC radio station. Francesco with his two sons, Frank and Lorenzo, Johannesburg, 1929 Later life The damp air and bad weather in Cape Town had a detrimental effect on Francesco's health and his TB resurfaced. After returning to Johannesburg, his health deteriorated significantly and after some months he was admitted into isolation at the Nelspoort Sanitarium in the Karoo desert, renowned for its treatment of TB. He made good progress and came back to Johannesburg in October 1928 to resume his career. However the odd hours and smoky atmosphere took its toll and he spent another three months at Nelspoort. He returned to Johannesburg, but soon after succumbed to a throat affliction, and passed away in May 1932 at the Hillbrow General Hospital. He is buried at Westpark Cemetery, Johannesburg.

After they were both awarded PhDs, they took up posts at Sheffield University, where he became a lecturer in 1955. It was here, with Kenneth Alexander and John Hughes, that he founded day-release educational courses for miners from Derbyshire and Yorkshire. Harrison also represented the National Union of Public Employees on Sheffield's trades and labour council. Harrison was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain until 1956, when he joined the Labour Party. In 1960 he helped found the Society of the Study of Labour History and became editor of its bulletin (which was later renamed the Labour History Journal).

Career Wayne Gagn√© began his college career at Western Michigan in 1983 in Bill Wilkinson's second recruiting class. The small defenseman was an instant hit for the Broncos, scoring 43 points in 41 games in his freshman season. After declining slightly in his sophomore year he exploded for 76 points as a junior, leading all defensemen in scoring and becoming the first AHCA First Team All-American for Western Michigan (with Dan Dorion). Gagn√© was instrumental in helping WMU win their first CCHA Tournament, being named to the All-Tournament Team, as well as their first NCAA Tournament appearance. Gagn√© performed even better in his senior season, finishing the year with the NCAA record for assists (76) for any position and points (89) for a defenseman in a season. Additionally, he also finished with the most career assists for a defenseman (199) and second most points (241) behind only Ron Wilson (Records current as of 2019). Gagn√© was named as the CCHA Player of the Year and was Runner-Up for the Hobey Baker Award. After graduating Gagn√© played briefly for the Canadian National Team before beginning his professional career. He played at the top level of minor league hockey in North America for two seasons, putting up good numbers, but his small stature was an impediment for NHL teams who mostly employed large players as defensemen. With the NHL an unlikely possibility, Gagn√© headed to Europe in 1989, playing two seasons with SC Lyss. He finished second in team scoring both seasons, helping the team to stave off relegation twice. Gagn√© spent the final three seasons of his career playing for five teams in five countries, ending as the leading scorer for Hellerup IK in 1994. Honors Gagn√© was inducted into the Western Michigan Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001 and was named to the CCHA All-Time First Team in 2013.

A Member of Parliament since 2017, he replaced Joseph Muscat as Leader of the Labour Party following the party's internal leadership election held on 11 January 2020, and was instated as prime minister on 13 January. Abela is the son of George Abela, the eighth president of Malta. Early life, family and professional career  Born in Sliema in the Northern Harbour District, to George Abela (President of Malta, 2009-2014) and his wife Margaret (n√©e Cauchi), Robert Abela grew up with his sister Marija in Gƒßaxaq and Marsaskala in the south of Malta. Their mother, Margaret, worked in the administration of the Old University in Valletta and later managed the family's law firm. Robert attended the Sisters‚Äô School in Santa Luƒãija and St Francis primary school in Bormla, to then continue secondary school and sixth form at St Aloysius' College. A football player in his youth, he played in goal for the national youth team. Abela also practised bodybuilding, competing twice in the national championships in the late 1990s.Lovin MaltaEvolution Bodybuilding Abela studied law at the University of Malta, where he met his future wife Lydia. He graduated in 2002. Following his graduation, he worked in the family's Abela Advocates law firm,TVM specializing in industrial and labour law. His law firm's contract with Malta's Planning Authority predates Labour's election in 2013 and has been renewed yearly since. Abela has been criticised for benefiting from direct orders for legal services for public entities, including Enemalta and Transport Malta. In 2018, Robert Abela said that no conflict of interest arose from his acting as legal representative of Air Malta while his father, former President George Abela, was the mediator and chief negotiator in talks with its pilots. After 2013, Abela Advocates held a license (IIP 161) for the sale of Maltese citizenship (Individual Investors Programme), in the name of Robert's wife Lydia.Agents List - Identity Malta, November 2019 The license was dropped in early 2020 once Robert became Prime Minister. In 2008, he married Lydia Abela (n√©e Zerafa), who later took the role of secretary of the Labour Party executive committee. They have a daughter, Giorgia Mae, born in 2012. Politics Robert Abela became involved in politics while his father George Abela was deputy party leader, supporting the party in the 1996 general election. He claimed that he started off transporting sick people to the polling stations in 1996, and worked behind the scenes for many years in other roles, such as representing the party on current affairs programmes as requested by Joseph Muscat and lately as his legal advisor in Cabinet. He also supported his father in the failed Labour leadership bid against Joseph Muscat in 2008, after Alfred Sant's resignation. On 25 January 2017, Abela highlighted that a patch of land in his native Qormi was seriously undervalued during the previous Partit Nazzjonalista administration, where contractors paid ‚Ç¨0.9 million instead of the full value of ‚Ç¨8 million. Abela was described as appealing to voters with no political ties, as well as the perfect replacement to attract Marie Louise Coleiro Preca's votes in the sixth district of Siggiewi, Luqa and Qormi. He had already been approached; however, he chose his legal profession over politics. Member of the Parliament of Malta In June 2017, at the age of 40, he was elected to the Parliament of Malta after his first attempt at contesting the sixth district, including Siggiewi, Luqa and Qormi, was successful. He also served as legal adviser to the Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, which enabled him to attend the meetings of the Council of Ministers.New York Times The Opposition claimed that his private consultancy contracts with the Planning Authority and Transport Malta earned him at least ‚Ç¨580,000.Times of Malta In October 2019 Abela stated that more Police are needed on Malta's streets to tackle residents' migration- related concerns.LovinMalta In his years at the Parliament, Abela was never an outspoken critic of Muscat; in the fallout of the Daphne Caruana Galizia murder, he remarked that he would have \\"acted earlier\\" to remove minister Konrad Mizzi and chief of staff Keith Schembri from their posts if he were leader. 2020 Labour leadership race Following the announcement of Joseph Muscat's upcoming resignation due to the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, and the ensuing protests, deputy prime minister Chris Fearne was considered the front-runner to replace Muscat as leader of the party and Prime Minister, and other hopefuls (including Ian Borg and Miriam Dalli) were reportedly pressured not to run in order to allow a quick transition by Christmas 2019 with the formality of a vote by party members for a single candidate. Robert Abela remarked that he did not want to be a part of any \\"diabolical pact\\", and presented his candidacy as an alternative to Chris Fearne. However, according to James Debono, Abela was soon recognised as the \\"continuity\\" candidate instead of Fearne, emphasizing stability, unity and normality, as opposed to the bolder changes advocated by Fearne.James Debono on Malta Today Abela's leadership campaign was focused on party members and aimed at striking a chord with the traditional Labour themes (social housing, free medicines for the elderly and better employment conditions for blue- collar workers)Times of Malta while distancing himself from the coziness of Muscat with big business. He also called for a crack-down on cheap labour migrant workers, who he accused of repressing local salaries, by proposing that employers be allowed to hire foreigners only if able to pay them fully on the books and while respecting work condition regulations.Lovin Malta He also guaranteed the continuation of Malta's controversial citizenship-by-investment programme. Abela, a backbencher with no ministerial experience, presented himself as a candidate of continuity, pledging to maintain the same cabinet as Muscat's, as well as the same staff at the powerful Office of the Prime Minister, in opposition to Chris Fearne, whose campaign for a clean slate at Castille created apprehension among insiders. Abela was openly critical of the 2019 Malta political crisis surrounding the Daphne Caruana Galizia carbombing. In fact, on 28 November 2019, he claimed that the Labour Party would need deep rooted changes rather than superficial ones. Abela also claimed that the only purpose of the 2019 Maltese protests was provocation. Abela also stated that his family law firm ‚Äî headed by his wife ‚Äî should retain the right to bid for public tenders, should he take up office.Malta Independent Following controversies,NewsBook he later backtracked and committed not to seek public contracts for his family law firm.Robert Abela's law firm would not retain government work after all , 10 January 2019, Times of Malta His campaign was criticised for not accepting any interviews from the independent press, but only relying on Labour-friendly media outlets.Malta Independent Leader of Labour Party and Prime Minister At the internal party elections on 12 January 2020, Abela obtained 9,342 votes against 6,798 for Chris Fearne. Over 92% of MLP members cast their vote in party clubs across the country.Times of Malta Abela was thus proclaimed new leader of the Labour Party. The following day Joseph Muscat resigned from the post of Prime Minister. President George Vella accepted Muscat's resignation and appointed Abela as new Prime Minister of Malta. His first official appointment was that of Clyde Caruana as his Head of Secretariat.

Synopsis Trieu, shown to be the daughter of Veidt from artificial insemination, visits Veidt in Karnak in 2008. She reveals her identity, and that she knows of Veidt's squid attack. She points out that the attack had stopped humanity from destroying itself, but only delayed the inevitable, even with Veidt's manufactured \\"squid rainfalls\\" he teleports out of Karnak designed to reinforce the idea of a pending alien attack. Trieu wants Veidt's financial help to build a quantum centrifuge to take the powers of Doctor Manhattan so she can enact a more permanent solution. Trieu reveals she knows Manhattan is on Europa and has launched a probe to arrive there in 2013 to visually confirm this. Veidt refuses to help. On Europa, Veidt uses the horseshoe to escape his cell as a spacecraft lands outside the castle. The Game Warden tries to stop him, but Veidt stabs him with the horseshoe, revealing he created the Game Warden to be an adversary over the last eight years as part of his play The Watchmaker's Son. The craft lifts off, showing that Veidt had spelled out \\"SAVE ME DAUGHTER\\" to be imaged by Trieu's probe. Veidt is encased in gold for the return trip. Trieu is shown to have recovered the craft after it crashed at the Clarks' farm, and kept Veidt as a statue in her gardens since then. Trieu revives Veidt with an hour left before the Millennium Clock activates. Veidt is impressed that Trieu did build her quantum centrifuge. When he sees Bian, he noted that Trieu cloned her mother. A sphere-like object detaches from the clock and floats towards the Greenwood district of Tulsa, while Trieu and her people set up equipment underneath it. At the Kavalry headquarters, several high-ranking politicians arrive, revealed as members of Cyclops, including the elder Joe Keene Sr. Laurie discovers that Wade has disguised himself as one of the Kavalry, having survived the attack at his house. The attack at Angela's house commences, and Doctor Manhattan is trapped. While stripping to a copy of Doctor Manhattan's briefs, Joe explains to the gathered audience about Cyclops' original long-term plan to revolt against President Robert Redford by arranging racially-charged events like the White Night. After discovering Manhattan's presence on Earth when one of its members ended up at the Grand Canyon, they changed their plans to take Manhattan's powers instead. Angela shows up to try to stop the event, but Keene ignores her warning. He enters a booth, but just as the system is activated, the entire area is teleported to Greenwood by Trieu as her men use magnetic shields to confiscate the Kavalry's weapons. She needed the Kavalry to capture Manhattan without him detecting her own involvement. Due to the Kavalry's lack of knowledge regarding safety measures that involve filtering atomic energy, Keene is liquefied during the process and his remains spill across the area and into Manhattan's cage once Trieu opens the booth. Trieu proceeds to kill the Cyclops members on behalf of Will as Jane Crawford guessed when Trieu was reading the Cyclops and the Kavalry's offenses towards colored people. During this time, Manhattan uses Keene's liquid remains to circumvent the cage inhibiting his powers, teleporting Veidt, Laurie, and Wade to Karnak. Manhattan tells Angela he did not send her away as he did not want to be alone when he dies, as Trieu activates the floating sphere to take Manhattan's powers. Manhattan tells Angela he loves her before he is destroyed and his powers captured. At Karnak, Veidt uses the squid rain device to send frozen squid to fall in Greenwood, which will obliterate anything in the nearby area. Laurie calls Angela in time to allow her and Bian to take cover, while the squid rain destroys the sphere and kills Trieu before the transfer can be completed. Angela takes shelter at the movie theater, where Will is waiting for her with her children. Will reveals Manhattan had made a deal with himself and Trieu, knowing this end had to happen so that his powers would not be taken by those that would misuse them. Veidt offers Laurie and Wade Nite Owl's airship \\"Archie\\" to return to society. Laurie prepares to arrest Veidt, with Wade having the 1985 video of proof that Veidt was behind the squid attack. When Veidt asks if they are going to go after Robert Redford as well, he gets a positive answer. Veidt attempts to talk his way out of it, but Wade knocks him out and he and Laurie drag him aboard the ship. Angela offers Will a room at her house as she takes her children back home. As she cleans up a mess of eggs from an argument between her and Manhattan earlier in the night, she recalls that Manhattan told her once that he could transfer his powers to someone else through an organic medium. Finding an unbroken egg, Angela goes to her pool, eats the egg, and prepares to walk on water across the pool. The screen cuts to black as her foot touches the water. Production Damon Lindelof said that from the start of writing, the plan for the season was to the finale be around Lady Trieu attempting to take Doctor Manhattan's powers for herself. A second element of the finale was to have involved a mind- control device used by Joe Keene to control both the Seventh Kavalry and the Tulsa police through their masks, of which Will would have gained control over to put an end to the Kavalry. During writing out later episodes, they came to the idea that the Kavalry was also seeking to capture Doctor Manhattan for themselves, and dropped the mind-control aspect, while modifying Trieu's plan to piggyback off the Kavalry's. The use of the frozen squid to lay waste to Trieu's plan was an inspiration from trying to capture a similar shot from the comic series of looking down at the devastation caused by the squid attack in 1985. They had struggled with what visual aspects they wanted to show here, but then recalled that in the pilot episode, they had established about Veidt's use of squid rainfall to continue to remind the world of an alien threat, and connected the dots to the finale. The importance of eggs had been something showrunner Lindelof had placed throughout prior episodes of the show, so that viewers would be aware of the significance of the egg in the final scene of the episode. This further continued into the use of the Spooky Tooth cover of \\"I Am the Walrus\\" by The Beatles as the credits song. Lindelof stated that \\"I Am the Walrus\\" is well known to have imaginative lyrics that The Beatles themselves have not offered to explain. Lindelof and the writers found ways to incorporate many of the song's lyrics into the episode. The title, \\"See How They Fly\\", refers to the falling frozen squid, while other lyrics like \\"Pretty little policemen in a row\\" and \\"Yellow matter custard Dripping from a dead dog's eye\\" were reflected in visual elements of the episode. Lindelof and his team had considered three possible endings of this episode: in addition to the one where Angela eats the egg and attempts to step onto the pool, they considered one where she simply crushed the egg in her hand, and another of putting the egg back into the carton and into the refrigerator. Staying with the choice where Angela eats the egg, they then debated how far they should go with the final shot, cutting the scene short to leave the implication vague. Lindelof says he does not consider the ending to be a cliffhanger, and intended to imply that Angela received Doctor Manhattan's powers by the egg, as the series had been written with the considering of what Angela would do with those types of powers, given that she would be more passionate about using such powers compared to Doctor Manhattan's passiveness. Reception Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, \\"See How They Fly\\" received a 91% approval rating, based on an average 8.62 out of 10 rating from 23 reviews. The summary of the critical consensus is \\"With its interconnected storylines, stellar performances, and complex themes, \\"See How They Fly\\" does the impossible and ends Damon Lindelof's adaptation of Watchmen spectacularly.\\" Ratings \\"See How They Fly\\" was watched by 935,000 viewers on its first live broadcast, and had over 1.6 million viewers when combined with repeated runs and streaming, exceeding the series' pilot viewership of 1.5 million.

It occurs most often in children and young adults between 5 and 19 years old. In 2013, it resulted in about 161,000 deaths ‚Äì down from 181,000 in 1990. Infants, children, and adolescents in south-central and Southeast Asia experience the greatest burden of illness. Outbreaks of typhoid fever are also frequently reported from sub-Saharan Africa and countries in Southeast Asia. In the United States, about 400 cases occur each year, and 75% of these are acquired while traveling internationally.http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/disease- reporting-and-management/disease-reporting-and-surveillance/_documents/gsi- typhoid-fever.pdf Historically, before the antibiotic era, the case fatality rate of typhoid fever was 10‚Äì20%. Today, with prompt treatment, it is less than 1%.Heymann, David L., ed. (2008), Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, Washington, D.C.: American Public Health Association, pg 665. . However, about 3‚Äì5% of individuals who are infected develop a chronic infection in the gall bladder. Since S. e. subsp. enterica is human- restricted, these chronic carriers become the crucial reservoir, which can persist for decades for further spread of the disease, further complicating the identification and treatment of the disease. Lately, the study of S. e. subsp. enterica associated with a large outbreak and a carrier at the genome level provides new insights into the pathogenesis of the pathogen. In industrialized nations, water sanitation and food handling improvements have reduced the number of cases. Developing nations, such as those found in parts of Asia and Africa, have the highest rates of typhoid fever. These areas have a lack of access to clean water, proper sanitation systems, and proper health- care facilities. For these areas, such access to basic public-health needs is not in the near future. Ancient Greece In 430 BC, a plague, which some believe to have been typhoid fever, killed one-third of the population of Athens, including their leader Pericles. Following this disaster, the balance of power shifted from Athens to Sparta, ending the Golden Age of Pericles that had marked Athenian dominance in the Greek ancient world. The ancient historian Thucydides also contracted the disease, but he survived to write about the plague. His writings are the primary source of information on this outbreak, and modern academics and medical scientists consider typhoid fever the most likely cause. In 2006, a study detected DNA sequences similar to those of the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever in dental pulp extracted from a burial pit dated to the time of the outbreak. The cause of the plague has long been disputed and other scientists have disputed the findings, citing serious methodologic flaws in the dental pulp-derived DNA study. The disease is most commonly transmitted through poor hygiene habits and public sanitation conditions; during the period in question related to Athens above, the whole population of Attica was besieged within the Long Walls and lived in tents. 16th and 17th centuries A pair of epidemics struck the Mexican highlands in 1545 and 1576, causing an estimated 7 to 17 million deaths. A study published in 2018 suggests that the cause was typhoid fever. Some historians believe that the English colony of Jamestown, Virginia, died out from typhoid. Typhoid fever killed more than 6,000 settlers in the New World between 1607 and 1624. Nineteenth century A long-held belief is that 9th US President William Henry Harrison died of pneumonia, but recent studies suggest he likely died from typhoid. This disease may also have been a contributing factor in the death of 12th US President Zachary Taylor due to the unsanitary conditions in Washington, DC, in the mid-19th century. During the American Civil War, 81,360 Union soldiers died of typhoid or dysentery, far more than died of battle wounds.Armies of Pestilence: The Effects of Pandemics on History . James Clarke & Co. (2004). p.191. In the late 19th century, the typhoid fever mortality rate in Chicago averaged 65 per 100,000 people a year. The worst year was 1891, when the typhoid death rate was 174 per 100,000 people. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, American troops were exposed to typhoid fever in stateside training camps and overseas, largely due to inadequate sanitation systems. The Surgeon General of the Army, George Miller Sternberg, suggested that the War Department create a Typhoid Fever Board. Major Walter Reed, Edward O. Shakespeare, and Victor C. Vaughan were appointed August 18, 1898, with Reed being designated the president of the board. The Typhoid Board determined that during the war, more soldiers died from this disease than from yellow fever or from battle wounds. The board promoted sanitary measures including latrine policy, disinfection, camp relocation, and water sterilization, but by far the most successful antityphoid method was vaccination, which became compulsory in June 1911 for all federal troops., Claude Moore Health Sciences Library. University of Virginia. Twentieth century right Original stool report for Mary Mallon, 1907. In 1902, guests at mayoral banquets in Southampton and Winchester, England, became ill and four died, including the Dean of Winchester, after consuming oysters. The infection was due to oysters sourced from Emsworth, where the oyster beds had been contaminated with raw sewage. The most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary. In 1907, she became the first carrier in the United States to be identified and traced. She was a cook in New York, who was closely associated with 53 cases and three deaths. Public-health authorities told Mary to give up working as a cook or have her gall bladder removed, as she had a chronic infection that kept her active as a carrier of the disease. Mary quit her job, but returned later under a false name. She was detained and quarantined after another typhoid outbreak. She died of pneumonia after 26 years in quarantine. A notable outbreak occurred in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1964, due to contaminated tinned meat sold at the city's branch of the William Low chain of stores. No fatalities resulted. Twenty-first century In 2004‚Äì05 an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo resulted in more than 42,000 cases and 214 deaths. Since November 2016, Pakistan has had an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever.

Its earliest examples came in the form of vocal groups that both sang and danced. The most notable early example is the Jeogori Sisters, who debuted in 1939.  1930‚Äì70: Early vocal groups  In the 1930s and the 1950s, the earliest mainstream Korean idols consisted of vocal groups that sang and performed at the same time. One of the first girl groups was the Jeogori Sisters, who debuted around 1939, while one of the first boy groups to debut was the Arirang Boys. The first idols to go abroad were The Kim Sisters, a three-member girl group that performed in the U.S. and South Korea from the 1950s to the 1970s. With the success of The Kim Sisters, a number of \\"sisters-type\\" girl bands started to rise in popularity, including the Silver Bell Sisters (1954), Hyun Sisters (mid-1950s), Jung Sisters (mid-1950s), Lee Sisters (1962), Lily Sisters (1969), Bunny Girls (1971), and National Treasure Sisters (1981). However, these groups differed from the concept of idol groups associated with the Korean Wave and K-pop.  1980‚Äì90: Dance singers  In the mid-to-late 1980s, independent music that was founded in the newly introduced genres of disco, soul, and funk began to rise in popularity. The debuts of Fire Trucks and Setorae in the 1980s is now considered to be the beginning of the current trend in boy and girl groups respectively. Korean dance singers and groups held performances based on Western dance music which combined exciting music and fancy dances, with the most prominent representatives of the movement being the Fire Trucks, Setorae, Kim Wan-sun, and Nami. In the early 1990s, songs started to combine repeated rhythms of electronic dance music such as house, techno, and trance with a melody that gives a trot-like feeling. In addition, simple rap due to the influence of American hip hop was especially popular among teenagers. This musical composition is called \\"new generation dance music\\" and has been adopted by current idol music. These younger generations were exposed to new musical influences as they began to find and listen to foreign music that had not yet been introduced to Korea.  1990: First-generation idols  Founded in 1989, SM Entertainment selected Hyun Jin- young, who was well known as a \\"dancer,\\" to debut as its first singer. However, in 1993, the company suffered financial difficulties when Hyun was discovered to be taking methamphetamine. As such it attempted to establish a new training system for singers in which teenagers were selected through auditions to practice singing and dancing before eventually debuting as singers. The company then recouped the capital they invested during their debuts through record sales and performance activities. H.O.T. was the first group under this system to be presented by SM Entertainment. The first- generation idol groups are usually groups of approximately five people, each of whom divided their roles into lead vocal, sub-vocal, dancer, and rapper. While singing on stage, their synchronous choreography, known as \\"group dance,\\" was more sophisticated compared to previous dance music, but at the same time included \\"point choreography\\" that teenagers could easily imitate. Musical performances were done only for two or three songs in the album‚Äîthe title song and follow-up song‚Äîand these songs were produced with music videos that showed each member's characteristics. After several months of performing, the singers took a break and resumed their career with their next album. This system became the basis for the second and third-generation idols. The first- generation idol groups were mostly formed by SM Entertainment, which had a focus on mysterious images, and DSP Media, which had a focus on realistic images. The two were known to have a rivalry with each other. Boy groups such as SM's H.O.T. and DSP's Sechs Kies arose, both of which made their debuts with songs about social criticism and became popular for their rhythmical dance music. SHINHWA maintained the group's identity with its masculine visual appeal and strong audience reception, while g.o.d built a friendly image by appearing on entertainment shows and producing songs that many generations could relate to. Meanwhile, girl groups such as SM's S.E.S. and DSP's Fin.K.L. maintained a cute and pure girl image for the band. Later, S.E.S displayed an unrealistic and mysterious image, and Fin.K.L displayed a friendly image for the band members. Baby V.O.X and DIVA had become popular for their strong female image as well. First-generation idols lost popularity in the 2000s. They often lip-synced as they performed with a focus on choreography, and most of the audience recognised that the songs heavily relied on digital techniques to correct the vocals of the idol singers. As a result, many people began to question the authenticity and competency of the singers. In addition, a series of controversies had erupted in contracts with idol members and adjustment of profits, and the idol-training system relied on terrestrial broadcasting while the music market was being converted into digital centres. Eventually, idol groups were disbanded, such as Sechs Kies in 2000, H.O.T. in 2001, S.E.S. in 2002, and Fin.K.L declaring a halt to team activities in 2002.  2000: Second-generation idols  With the decline of the first-generation idols in the early 2000s, solo singers from big agencies, such as BoA, Rain and Seven, became popular alongside solo singers who were formerly part of a group, such as Kangta, Moon Hee-joon, Bada, Ock Joo-hyun, and Lee Hyori. TVXQ made its debut as an a cappella group in 2004, and was followed by SS501 and Super Junior in 2005 and Big Bang in 2006,, but were not as trendy as first- generation idols. The rise of second-generation idols can be attributed to the 2007 release of Wonder Girls‚Äô \\"Tell Me\\", which became so popular that it was named a \\"syndrome.\\" TVXQ, SS501, Super Junior and Big Bang, all of which debuted earlier, subsequently joined the popularity triggered by Wonder Girls. The second-generation idol groups usually consisted of six or more members, formed a \\"group in a group\\" called a unit, and ran group and unit activities at the same time. The agencies tried to manage their idol groups more thoroughly than the first generation to prevent problems. They regularly evaluated trainees' singing and dancing abilities and ended contracts with trainees if their abilities did not improve or were significantly inferior. They also put an emphasis on personality and dismissed trainees whose behaviour was controversial. The music released during this period consisted mainly of hook songs in which a short chorus was repeatedly presented, and most songs were deliberately composed similar to Western pop music to target foreign market listeners. Since the digitisation of the music market required frequent releases of albums and continuous exposure to the public to maximise profits as an agency, singles and extended plays with fewer tracks than regular albums became common. Unlike first-generation idols, second-generation idols appeared on entertainment shows and established \\"friendly images outside the stage\\" that were different from their \\"image on stage\\". Second-generation idols also extended their demographic to middle-aged people, and as a result introduced the term \\"Samchon Fan\\", which referred to male fans in their 30s and 40s. Female fans of girl groups, called \\"Yeodeok\\", were also established. The rivalry present in the first-generation idols was not as frequent among second-generation idols as concepts and music genres diversified. Wonder Girls and Girls' Generation, who debuted in 2007, gained popularity together and were perceived to be rivals, but as more idol groups made their debuts there were fewer instances of them being dubbed rivals. Wonder Girls, Kara, and Girls' Generation pursued an appealing image and were heavily influenced by the groups in the previous generation, with Kara resembling Fin.K.L. while Girls' Generation resembled S.E.S. Brown Eyed Girls became popular with both men and women for their own musical characteristics, while 4minute, 2NE1, f(x), and Miss A took on the independent female image of Baby V.O.X and DIVA. SISTAR, Girl's Day and AOA pursued a sex theme, while Apink pursued a theme of innocence. TVXQ and Big Bang were considered different from traditional idols as they created music that showed originality and maturity, and TVXQ in particular drew attention by releasing different albums from country to country. SS501 and Super Junior became popular because they introduced the concept of idol groups appearing on entertainment shows. SHINee built a pretty-boy image, and 2PM built a masculine image called \\"Jim Seung-dol\\". FT Island and CNBLUE were band-type idol groups.  2010: Third-generation idols  Idols that debuted in the 2010s are known as third-generation idols. EXO is considered to be the starting point for the third generation, particularly for boy groups. On the other hand, many girl groups disbanded after the Korea Fair Trade Commission stipulated in 2009 that exclusive contracts between agencies and celebrities could only last a maximum duration of seven years; as such, girl groups are classified as third-generation if they debuted after 2014. Some second-generation girl groups were categorized as \\"Generation 2.5\\" if they debuted in the transitional period between Generations 2 and 3, which includes groups that debuted from 2010 to 2012. The idol groups' marketing strategy had become more diverse due to social media, which has led to the emergence of unprocessed, self-produced content on sites such as YouTube, AfreecaTV, and V App rather than through TV programs. Idol members also began to post on social networking services to get closer to their fans. In terms of planning, the \\"localisation\\" strategy expanded not only through releasing albums in different countries or performing in different languages but by including foreign, non-Korean members directly into groups. Idol groups such as I.O.I and Wanna One were selected and debuted on popular singing competition programs akin to American Idol. Since the mid-2010s, there have been more cases of second and third generation idols using group activity breaks to release records as solo singers and deviate from their groups' characteristics. The concepts of third-generation idol groups have also evolved to be more nuanced as the number of girl groups targeting female audiences increased. In addition to their singing ability, MAMAMOO, for example, attempted to utilise male attire in the title track of Pink Funky, which in turn gained them the \\"girl crush\\" image and was well-received by their target audience. Lovelyz chose their concept to be \\"girls seen from a girl's gaze.\\" GFriend took on a concept reminiscent of \\"healthy youth\\" and bore the innocent image of S.E.S., Fin.K.L, and Girls‚Äô Generation.

The film was directed, produced, designed, and animated by Priestley. Both sound design and production were provided by R. Dennis Wiancko.Cartoons Considered For An Academy Award-1983-Cartoon Research Synopsis Voices is an exploration of fear of the dark, old age, obesity, monsters, and global destruction. According to Northwest Film and Video Festival juror Marv Newland, \\"Priestley gets across a series of personal phobias in a refreshing and humorous fashion. We get a superb, contemporary animated film with salutes to historical cartoon figures scattered throughout.\\" Ed Emshwiller described the film as \\"showing great joy and delight in being alive\\" and a \\"message with style\\". Production Priestley began work on Voices in Portland, Oregon, in spring 1983, after completing The Rubber Stamp Film. She wrote the script, rehearsed it and hired cinematographer Jan Baross to shoot the live-action 16 mm footage that was used for rotoscoping. In September 1983, Priestley moved to Valencia, California, to attend California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), where she was the teaching assistant to Jules Engel, head of the Experimental Animation Department. Voices became one of three films, along with Jade Leaf (the first computer film made at CalArts) and The Dancing Bulrushes (co-directed by Steven Subotnick), that were presented at Priestley's thesis review. She received an MFA in Experimental Animation and the Louis B. Mayer Award. Priestley used pencil, India ink, felt pens, watercolors, and gouache on index cards to animate Voices. The movie was made over a three-year period. The index cards were shot on 16 mm film (Kodak ECO stock) with an old Bolex camera that was purchased at a flea market. Priestley used a simple, homemade animation stand that was a gift from Portland filmmaker Jim Blashfield. Soundtrack R. Dennis Wiancko created the soundtrack for Voices by using music clips and homemade sound effects. He stated, \\"The squeaky sounds when Felix (the Cat) is rubbing his tail came from a rubber suction device in a snakebite kit that is used to remove venom from a wound.\\" Wiancko collected source material with a Tascam stereo cassette recorder and layered the sound master together on a quarter-inch open reel recorder. Release Voices was released in 1985 and premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado. The film was re-released on DVD in 2006 by Microcinema International. Voices was screened in many retrospectives of Priestley's works, including at REDCAT in Los Angeles in April 2009, Stuttgart International Animation Festival and British Film Institute (BFI) National Film Theatre in May 2017, Sweaty Eyeballs Animation Festival in Baltimore, Maryland, on October 18, 2019, and Fantoche International Animation Festival (Baden, Switzerland) on September 3, 2019.

Background The province of Compostela Valley was carved out from Davao del Norte in 1998. In early 2019, Republic Act No. 11297 was passed into law renaming Compostela Valley to Davao de Oro, subject to the province's residents' approval in a plebiscite. The legislation was signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on April 17, 2019 and the signing was made known to the public on May 23, 2019. The Philippine national government's Commission on Elections (Comelec) was tasked to supervise and conduct the required plebiscite. Republic Act No. 11297 was proposed as House Bill 7363, which was filed before the House of Representatives on May 15, 2018, and Senate Bill 1746, which was filed before the Senate on December 10, 2018. Representatives Pedro Acharon Jr., Ruwel Peter Gonzaga, and Maria Carmen Zamora were the proponents of HB 7363 and Senators Juan Miguel Zubiri and Sonny Angara were the proponents of the Senate counterpart of the House bill. The two proposed bills were consolidated on January 29, 2019. Supporters of the renaming said that renaming Compostella Valley to Davao de Oro would strengthen the association of the province with the rest of the Davao Region; prior to the plebiscite, Davao de Oro as Compostella Valley was the only province in the region without \\"Davao\\" in its name. As per Resolution No. 10614 of Comelec, all voters in the 11 municipalities of Compostela Valley who voted in the 2019 Philippine general election were eligible to participate. Preparations Campaign Since March 2019, the provincial government of Compostela Valley led by governor Tyrone Uy started the campaign to convince voters to approve the renaming of their province. Tyrone Uy's campaign was helped by Arturo Uy, his father and a former governor of his province. The proposed name of \\"Davao de Oro\\" was formally launched on March 8, 2019 during the Bulawan Festival. Organization Polling for the plebiscite was scheduled to run from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on December 7, 2019. was allocated for the conduct of the plebiscite. President Rodrigo Duterte also directed the police and the military to ensure the security of the province during the plebiscite. A province-wide gun ban was imposed in Compostela Valley from November 7 to December 7, 2019 and at least one police checkpoint was set up in each of the province's 11 municipalities. Question The question used in the ballot was in Filipino and voters were asked to vote either \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". The question was: : > \\"Pumapayag ka ba na palitan ang pangalan ng lalawigan ng Compostela Valley > at gawing lalawigan ng Davao de Oro > alinsunod sa Batas Republika bilang 11297?\\" > > Voters wrote \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" or its equivalent in Filipino. Results The results of the plebiscite was counted manually and was submitted to the Provincial Plebiscite Board of Canvassers. The turnout of the plebiscite as per the Comelec was around 45 percent which translates to 178,953 participants out of the 410,262 eligible votes. Majority of the voters favored the renaming with 174,442 voting \\"yes\\" and 5,020 voted \\"no\\". Canvassing was slowed due to inconsistencies regarding the number of votes in four municipalities. The results of the plebiscite was approved by the Comelec at 10:24 p.m. on December 8, 2019.

First introduced in a document entitled \\"Border Patrol Strategic Plan of 1994 and Beyond\\" this policy has since been used to police high traffic areas of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. Since its institution an estimated 10,000 migrants passing through Mexico have died in an attempt to cross through the Sonoran Desert into the United States. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs places the number of deaths at roughly 450 per year (including migrant deaths on both the US and Mexican territory).  History  The United States implemented \\"Prevention through Deterrence\\" in the 1990s when immigrants crossing the Rio Grande from Reynosa, Mexico attracted the media's attention pressuring immigration officials and politicians to create a new enforcement policy. The idea is to redirect the routes of the migrants into the Sonoran Desert to discourage migrants from crossing. The United States Government relies on the environment of the Sonoran Desert to deter these migrants without much help from the border enforcement agency.  Previous strategies used by the United States  = Operation Blockade = Operation Blockade occurred from September 19, 1993 through October 2, 1993. Border Patrol agents were deployed along the 20 mile segment of the border \\"on an around-the clock basis and with repairs to the border fence in downtown El Paso area,\\" Although the blockade ended on October 2, 1993, on September 24, 1993 Border Patrol announces that the operation \\"will continue indefinitely.\\" The impact of the operation was seen immediately, because the usual level of attempted entry and arrest declined. The intention was to shift the traffic away from the city and ‚Äúput [migrants] out in areas where they‚Äôre on [Border Patrol‚Äôs] turf.‚Äù This approach soon evolved into the policy of Prevention through Deterrence. = Chinese Exclusions Act of 1888 = The Chinese Exclusions Act of 1888 was a federal statute that prohibited Chinese laborers from entering and re-entering the United States. When Chinese laborers were denied entrance they would enter the United States illegally the southern border with Mexico. According to anthropologist Jason De Le√≥n, it was during the implementation of the Act that we see an early application of prevention through deterrence by the immigration agents. De Le√≥n points out that in order to deter more immigrants from crossing, patrol officers only apprehend immigrants on established routes where they had access to resources, this began to push immigrants into more rural areas with less resources. Scholars state, ‚Äúfrom their earliest work [by] enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Acts [enacted in 1882], immigration authorities [have] discovered that the desert and mountain wilderness [can] be made effective allies in the fight against undocumented entry.\\"  Debates   Measurement  The effect of prevention through deterrence is measured in different ways. The U.S. government can use the number of immigrant apprehensions to evaluate prevention through deterrence but, this does not measure how many migrants allude border patrol or how many how many migrants are dying at the southern border. Alternatively a 1997 report by the Government Accountability Office, did use the immigrant death toll to measure the effect of prevention through deterrence. The Department of Homeland Security also publishes the number of migrant deaths; however, according to De Le√≥n, it is the lowest estimate.  Praise  The goals of the Strategic Plan of 1994 as stated by border patrol, was not only to slow the number of migrants crossing the southern border, but to promote confidence in the United States' ability to protect that border. By apprehending more undocumented immigrants using prevention through deterrence, border patrol also wanted to \\"protect the immigration heritage\\" that serves as the foundation of our country today. De Le√≥n points out that by using terms like \\"tactical advantage\\" and \\"deterring,\\" government documents format prevention through deterrence as a humane but powerful strategy.  Criticism  According to De Le√≥n, there is a \\"war on non-citizens\\" at the U.S.-Mexican border and the primary weapon used by the U.S. is prevention through deterrence, which shifts the blame of migrant deaths from the government to the environment. Necroviolence, a term coined by De Le√≥n, is the intentionally \\"offensive, sacrilegious, or inhumane\\" treatment of a deceased individual as perceived by the actor and/or the culture of the victim. De Le√≥n applies necroviolence to prevention through deterrence through the effect the environment has on diseased individuals. De Le√≥n also believes that the fear of necroviolence not only serves as a way to prevent more immigrants from crossing the border, but by condemning individuals to a clandestine death they, and the people who knew them, are stripped of spiritual and emotional closure. = Shaping history = According to De Le√≥n, the U.S. government does not acknowledge the part it plays in the increase of migrant deaths at the southern border; however, over the past 20 years the United States government has been collecting materials left behind by undocumented immigrants. Therefore, artifacts are no longer available for scholars like De Le√≥n to study. As Paul Farmer pointed out, this is a technique used by authoritative structures to establish a particular historical account of an event.  Locations   Using the environment  U.S. border patrol uses the environment to execute the prevention through deterrence strategy. For example, features of the terrain such as; bodies of water, mountains, valleys, extreme temperatures etc., are \\"natural barriers,\\" for individuals crossing the border. To use the uninhabited environment in prevention through deterrence, border patrol increased surveillance in cities along the southern border, which pushed migrant entry points into rural areas.  The Americas  Sonoran Desert The idea of Prevention Through Deterrence stemmed at the border between the United States and Mexico. This area is referred to as the Sonoran Desert located in Arizona which is known as an inhospitable area. Many determined migrants also chose to cross the R√≠o Bravo which separates northeast Mexico from Texas because this area is known to have less border security. Migrants from Central America have used the means of the Rio Grande in order to cross the border as well. Over 22 years (from 1990-2012), 2,238 migrant bodies were found in Prima County, Arizona, and 1,813 bodies, over half of those recovered, died from exposure. However, these statistics only include the migrants bodies that were recovered and only represent a small portion of the border.  Europe  Mediterranean Sea In May 2019 the European Union was accused of knowingly sending several thousand migrants to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya. The Mediterranean has been used as means of Prevention Through Deterrence when the EU made the decision to decrease its search and rescue operations in 2014. Along the border of Greece and Turkey 25,000 antitank and antipersonnel mines were left dormant after the 1974 Cyprus dispute. Despite the ratification of the Ottawa Convention in 1977 banning antipersonnel mines the complete removal has yet to be completed. Far right Greek politicians have called for the extension of these mines further along the border as an anti-immigration deterrent.

Biography  Bottici is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Director of Gender Studies at The New School for Social Research and Eugene Lang College, New York. Bottici studied philosophy at the University of Florence, then obtained a PhD from the European University Institute in 2004. After a post-doctorate at the SUM (Istituto Italiano di Science Umane) under the guidance of Roberto Esposito, she taught at the University of Frankfurt, subsequently joining the faculty of The New School for Social Research, where she has been teaching since 2010. Bottici is known for her work on how images and imagination affect politics and her feminist experimental writings. Her work has explored the role that images and imagination play in politics. She is the author of six books, including A Philosophy of Political Myth (Cambridge University Press, 2007), Imaginal Politics (Columbia University Press, 2014), and Per tre miti, forse quattro (Manni, 2016), which address the history of philosophy, critical theory, psychoanalysis, and feminism. With Jacob Blumenfeld and Simon Critchley, she also edited The Anarchist Turn (Pluto Press, 2013).  Major Works  Bottici's philosophical work is devoted to exploring the politics of imagination in its different aspects, from a general theory about the role of images in politics to more specific inquiries into sexism, heteronormativity, ethnonationalism, Eurocentrism, Islamophobia, racism, and the coloniality of power.  Political analogies and metaphors  Bottici's work examines the function of the metaphor of the state as a person within the Western canon of political philosophy and its fate in the contemporary epoch, a time in which challenges to the traditional notion of state sovereignty question the idea of clear-cut boundaries, and therefore the possibility of drawing any analogy between states and individuals. Bottici's first book, Men and States: Rethinking the Domestic Analogy in the Global Age (Italian edition ETS 2004, Eng. trans. Palgrave 2009) offered a systematic reconstruction of the role that the analogy between states and individuals has played in European modern political philosophy and in contemporary theories of globalization, where the modern sovereign state is often taken as the culminating point of political life and where the gendered dimension of political thinking is emphasized. Jan Niklas Rolf critiqued Bottici's approach as conflating the analogy between the domestic and the international realm (the domestic analogy properly understood) and the analogy between the state of nature and the international realm (the state of nature analogy).  Political myth  One of Bottici's specific contributions to social philosophy and critical theory is her philosophy of political myth developed in her work A Philosophy of Political Myth. By offering a critique in the form of a genealogy, following Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals, Bottici provides a critical philosophical framework for the concept of political myth, explaining why political myths are a crucial ingredient of modern politics. Drawing from Hans Blumenberg's concept of Work on Myth (Arbeit am Mythos), Bottici shows myths are not objects given once and for all, but rather processes, in which their reception is an integral part of their elaboration. Duncan Kelly states that Bottici's philosophy of political myth provides a framework within which the study of myth can be usefully deployed \\"and in this she has performed a useful work of Lockean philosophical underlaboring.\\" In 2006, Bottici started to apply her philosophy of political myth to specific case studies, collaborating with sociologist Beno√Æt Challand. The Myth of the Clash of Civilizations follows the interdisciplinary spirit of the early Frankfurt school by combining philosophy, psychoanalysis, and empirical research to examine the roots of Islamophobia in contemporary societies, particularly in the post 9/11 Western world. Bottici and Challand argue that the image of a clash between Islam and the West is a political myth because it is a self- fulfilling prophecy nourished by centuries of Orientalism, Occidentalism, and identity politics as rooted in the history of European colonialism. In Imagining Europe: Myth, Memory and Identity, Bottici and Challand applied their critique of ethnocentrism to Europe itself. For Bottici and Challand, the concept of Europe relies on a specific politics of imagination where mythical and historical narratives are most often intermingled. Examples include the idea that Europe was born out of the Greek Civilization, the belief in an intrinsically Christian Europe, and finally, the concept of Europe as the cradle of modernity. They argue that among Europe's founding myths, the most powerful ones are those that rely on geopolitical maps and other artefacts of the imagination, such as the division between Eastern and Western Europe or the idea of a fortress Europe.  Imaginal politics  Bottici's early work‚Äì‚Äìas well as her multidisciplinary engagement with art and psychoanalysis‚Äì‚Äìculminated in Imaginal Politics, a book that provides a general and systematic reflection on the link between politics and our capacity to imagine. Whereas most philosophical theories focus on imagination understood as an individual faculty that we possess or on the social imaginary understood as the social background in which we live, Bottici proposes the concept of the imaginal as an \\"in-between\\" third alternative. The imaginal, defined as the space made of images, of representations that are also presences in themselves, acts both as the result of an individual faculty as well as the product of the social context. In contrast to the term \\"imaginary,\\" which maintains its connotation of unreality or alienation, as in Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory, the \\"imaginal\\" does not make any ontological assumption as to the status of images, and is therefore a more malleable tool for thinking about images in an age of virtuality. Political theorist John Grant compared Bottici's approach to the social imaginary to that of Charles Taylor and Michael Warner, arguing that, although her work is an improvement on Taylor's understanding of the social imaginary as a mere \\"background,\\" Bottici fails through her dismissal of ideology in its negative form, resulting in \\"an abandonment of the very dialectical mode that could have reinvigorated her work.\\" However, writer and media scholar McKenzie Wark emphasized that Bottici's philosophy of the imaginal opens the space for thinking about what precedes the division between real and unreal as well as that between the individual and the social, and, as such, it is a welcome contribution to thinking about the destiny of images in a time when the technological transformations of capitalism have tightened the link between politics and the images to such a degree that \\"they are no longer what mediates our doing politics but rather what risks doing politics in our stead.\\"  Transindividuality  Bottici's work on the imaginal, as this third alternative between the individual and the social reflects her efforts to move towards a new social ontology. In a 2017 interview, Bottici states that \\"to understand the present, we have to understand how we actually got here, which other roads we missed on the way, and thus, also, possibly whether we can get off this path,\\" explaining her work as animated by the question, \\"where is the new coming from?\\" Drawing from her work on Baruch Spinoza and on Etienne Balibar's reading of Spinoza's Ethics, Bottici embraced the concept of the transindividual, contributing to the development of a philosophy of transindividuality. In a 2017 seminar on mass psychology and Trumpism with Judith Butler, Bottici emphasized the ongoing production and receipt of the political image as a mode of the ongoing production and receipt of the political self.  Anarcha-feminism  The philosophy of transindividuality, according to which individuals must be understood not as objects, but as continuous and contingent processes of association that happen at the inter-, infra-, and supra-individual level, is central to Bottici's feminist writings. Her recent work in this area elaborates a contemporary theory of anarcha- feminism, which argues against a one single principle (or arch√©) that explains gender oppression, and emphasizes ongoing interrogations of specific intersections of class, race, empire, sexuality, hetero- and cis- normativity. Bottici connects intersectional feminism and the anarcho-feminism of the past to argue that \\"another woman is possible.\\" As Bottici argues, \\"bodies are plural and plural is their oppression,\\" therefore anarcha-feminism is a philosophic methodology for going beyond gendered racial and social division and \\"thus also, in a way, beyond feminism itself.\\" Bottici's editorial work and writing for The New School's Public Seminar, an online forum dedicated to creating a global intellectual commons, and her multiple performances in the global Night of Philosophy project, founded by philosopher and curator M√©riam Korichi, reflect Bottici's engagement with philosophy as a critical practice as well as a practice of critique.  Feminist experimental writings  Along with her academic and philosophical work, Bottici is also known for her creative writing, particularly her feminist experimental writings. Whereas Bottici's academic work provides a philosophy of the imaginal, her experimental writings put forward an imaginal philosophy, that is, a form of polystylism where literary images convey philosophical ideas. An important part of her work in this area was devoted to retelling the myths of femininity from the point of view of contemporary time, transforming figures of the old patriarchal mythology, such as Sheherazade, Ariadne, and Europa, into feminist symbols. Bottici's retelling of the myth of the \\"city of women\\" recalls Monique Wittig's Les guerrilieres, as well as other works in the √©criture f√©minine tradition. Writer and critic Gabriele Pedulla described Bottici's reappropriation of the myths of femininity as a \\"magic that breaks the order,\\" a magic that reminds us of the work of Massimo Bontempelli, the Italian theorist of magic realism and inspirer of Italo Calvino, but also the \\"euphoric rupture\\" of surrealist literature. Bottici's creative practice has extended to Anglophone poetry and the art of the libretto, including her collaboration with composer and multimedia artist Jean-Baptiste Barriere. A preview of the opera, titled \\"The Art of Change,\\" was performed in 2019 at The Festival of the New.

Early years One of eight children, Neal was the daughter of Mr. And Mrs. Carlton M. Neal of Baxter, Pennsylvania. Her brother taught her to play violin when she was eight years old. By the time she was 12, she was part of a family group playing for square dances. For a time she left the violin to play Hawaiian guitar, but then she returned to the violin, which she played with the DuBois Symphony Orchestra.  Military tours  Neil toured five times in Vietnam during the war there. Overall, she performed for U.S. military personnel from 1944 until 1965, with stops including Greenland, Guam, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, the South Pacific islands, Taiwan, Iwo Jima, Labrador, and Saipan.  Broadcasting  A successful audition made Neal a member of the group Phil Reed and his Golden West Girls on radio station WHJB in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. She stayed there 13 years. Later, Neal had a radio program on WAMO and a television program, both in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. In the early 1950s, she was featured on WWVA radio in Wheeling, West Virginia, and on television stations WDTV and WENS in Pittsburgh and WJAC in Johnstown. In the mid-1950s, Neal and her band, The Ranch Girls, were featured on the Old Dominion Barn Dance. Besides performing music, she worked as a disc jockey on radio in Pittsburgh.  Injury and relocation  Neal was hospitalized for 16 weeks after her hip was broken when the car in which she and a member of her musical group were riding skidded on a wet highway and hit a concrete pillar on December 4, 1951. Word of her situation brought unsolicited responses -- over 600 handkerchiefs and monetary donations (which she donated to help handicapped children). After recovering from that injury, she moved to Nevada, where she performed in venues in Elko, Lake Tahoe, and Las Vegas. Neal retired in 1975 after a stint at the Golden Nugget Las Vegas. In retirement she and other retired musicians performed for people in senior centers, hospitals, and convalescent facilities.  Personal life  On October 10, 1953, Neal married Eugene B. Johnson, who was her professional manager and a theatrical agent. For 27, years, Neal was married to Mac McKinnon, who died in 1999. Death On February 15, 2004, Neal died of a cancer-related illness at Manor Care Health Services in Reno, Nevada, at age 85. Legacy One fan of Neal's disc jockey program on WMAO was young Lugee Sacco, who later changed his name to Lou Christie and achieved success with \\"Lightning Strikes\\" and other recordings. He cited the influence of Neal on the harmonies in his successful songs. Although other musical artists influenced him to some extent, he said, \\"... my music has always had lots of vocal harmonies, and that goes back to Abbie Neal.\\" After Neal retired, Christie reconnected with her and the two formed a 20-year friendship that lasted until her death. With her cooperation, he compiled material from her performances on radio, stage, and TV to produce \\"Abbie Neal and Her Ranch Girls\\", her final album.

The episode centers on the character of Doctor Manhattan and events of his life after the limited series comic. Synopsis In 2009, on the anniversary of VVN (Victory in Vietnam) Day, Angela Abar, then a police officer in Saigon, is met by Doctor Manhattan in a bar. Manhattan introduces himself and asks Angela to dinner the next night. Angela initially doesn't believe Manhattan, as numerous people are dressed as him for the holiday. After explaining how he experiences time simultaneously, Manhattan says that after leaving Earth in 1985, he had been on Europa, creating life in a closed ecosystem. He had created clones of Phillips and Crookshanks, the lord and lady of a British manor who had housed him and his father after they escaped Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Manhattan explains that, after he surreptitiously witnessed the two having sex, Phillip and Crookshanks encouraged him to create something beautiful. After creating life on Europa, he teleported the manor there for the clones, but eventually left because of the clones' obsession with pleasing and worshiping him. Angela continues to doubt Manhattan's identity and why he is interested in her. Manhattan explains events of the future to her, knowing she will help him during a period in time that he cannot foresee. In two weeks' time, Angela helps Manhattan select a body from a morgue to take on its human appearance to avoid detection. He adopts the persona of Calvin Jelani, who had recently died of a presumed heart attack. In six months, Angela becomes frustrated with Manhattan's lack of empathy. Manhattan visits Adrian Veidt, who has isolated himself at Karnak, his Antarctica base. Seeing Manhattan has fallen in love, Veidt offers him a small device he had created in 1985, originally intended as a weapon to use against Manhattan. The device uses tachyons to inhibit Manhattan's memory, rendering him unable to use his powers except in life-or- death circumstances. In exchange, Manhattan offers to teleport Veidt to his Europa ecosystem, where the Phillips and Crookshanks clones will serve and adore him as he so desires. Before allowing Angela to use the device on him, Manhattan visits Will in New York City, explaining he will need to help his granddaughter Angela in 2019. In 2019, after Angela removes Veidt's device, Manhattan tells her that he is aware of the Seventh Kavalry's plan to capture him, and teleports their children to safety with Will in downtown Tulsa. Angela realizes Manhattan is speaking simultaneously to her in 2019 and to Will in 2009, and demands Manhattan ask Will how he knew of Judd's connection to Cyclops. Will, in 2009, tells Manhattan that he does not know Judd, and Angela realizes that she gave Will the idea to kill Judd that started the events of the series. Manhattan states the Kavalry are about to attack. Angela, despite knowing that Manhattan is aware of the future, prepares to defend him; Manhattan tells her this was the moment he fell in love with her. The two kill most of the Kavalry, but the last one fires a tachyon cannon to capture him, to Angela's anguish. In Vietnam 2009, Angela accepts Manhattan's story and invitation to dinner. In a post-credit scene, Veidt is punished by the Phillips and Crookshanks clones for wanting to leave. In his cell, the Game Warden brings him an anniversary cake. It is revealed that the Game Warden was the first Phillips created by Manhattan. After the Warden leaves, Veidt discovers a horseshoe baked into the cake, and begins to use it to escape. Production The episode was directed by Nicole Kassell, who also directed the series's first two episodes. Kassell stated that Yahya Abdul- Mateen II played Doctor Manhattan throughout the episode, including within the bar scenes. As Dr. Manhattan, Abdul-Mateen spoke outside of his normal voice range. The choice to not reveal his face during these scenes was part of Damon Lindelof and Jeff Jensen's script. They also feared that showing Manhattan's face at this point would cause fans of the limited series to be disappointed and upset, regardless of what approach they used for matching the comic. As shooting a conversation where only one person's face would be visible, Kassell worked with cinematographer Greg Middleton to establish what blocking shots they would use to avoid excessive repetition through these scenes, as well as how they would transition in and out of these scenes. Abdul-Mateen had accepted the role of Cal before knowing he would also be Doctor Manhattan; he was only told this between filming of the second and third episodes. Because he knew this would likely involve him being naked, he hired a personal trainer and started a diet to be able to present a good body image for the camera. Makeup to cover Abdul-Mateen took about two and a half hours of airbushing, while removing the makeup took another hour of washing with solvents. The Vietnamese bar was modeled after Eddie's bar in Vietnam in the limited series. The episode included shots from within Karnak, Veidt's Antarctica base, and directed some shots to be nearly identical to those from the comic. In the flashback to young Jon Ostermann's time at the manor, an illustrated Bible is shown to him. The illustrations were drawn by Dave Gibbons, the illustrator of the original limited series, and who has been working with Lindelof on the series. The episode featured the series' only post-credits scene with Veidt after being put on trial. Kassell said that they opted to use a post-credits scene to avoid disrupting the calculated flow of the rest of the episode, comparing the scene to the comic's additional material after each chapter. The title of the episode was a happenstance, according to Kessell. They had given Angela the surname \\"Abar\\" early in development. Later, as they were storyboarding episodes, Kassell had saw one of the writers had put down \\"...walks into a bar...\\" as a concept for this episode, and on seeing that, realized the serendipitous nature of the Abar name. Reception Critical response \\"A God Walks into Abar\\" received universal critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 9.25 out of 10, based on 23 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Watchmen seamlessly begins to tie up loose ends, but Regina King and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's exceptional performances make 'A God Walks Into Abar' a surprisingly beautiful and profoundly tragic love story.\\" \\"A God Walks into Abar\\" was one of six television episodes nominated in 2020 for a Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. Accolades For the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II won the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, and editor Henk Van Eeghen won the award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Limited Series or Movie for this episode.

It stars Mark-Paul Gosselaar as a young man with superpowers, whose enigmatic past catches up with him just as he begins to investigate it. Plot Eight- year-old Mike Hillary (Marc Donato) dreams of fire and a fire breaks out in his room. His mother (Carmelina Lamanna) perishes trying to save him. At the home of his grandparents (Dennis O'Connor and Jennifer Higgin), when his duvet begins to smoulder, he gets into a drawn bath to sleep in. Now 24, unemployed minor league baseball player Mike Hillary (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) still sleeps in a drawn bath. After reading a short note from an old friend of his mother's which says \\"I believe you\\", he drives to her hometown to meet town sheriff Jimmy Masterson (David Nerman), who suggests considering the athletic counsellor job at the community centre. Mike asks why his mother left. Masterson says she was pregnant and unmarried but says no more. Frustrated and angered, Mike leaves just as a fire starts in Masterson's trash can. Mike starts working at the community centre. He notices children painting the number 11 surrounded by flames. Some \\"troubled\\" children respond to swimming, except James (Jared Durand), who fears the water. Mike seems to give the boy an emotional boost, to the delight of instructor Jessica Randall (Ingrid Kavelaars). Later, she catches up with him while jogging. They are accosted by her bully of an ex-boyfriend Blaine (Mark Lutz) and a fight ensues, Mike manifesting super strength and an unfocussed power of remote or tactile spontaneous combustion: objects ignite and Blaine suffers burns to his chest from Mike's pyrokinetic touch. During a baseball game at the community centre, Mike has a vision of James being hurt and bullied by another boy, Bart (Kevin Zegers). Mike finds them and puts a stop to it. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Blaine (his son) claims that Mike attacked him and has \\"superhuman powers.\\" Masterson is skeptical ‚Äî until Blaine shows him a hand-shaped burn on his chest. Later, Mike swims in the community centre's pool with Jessica, who notices the water getting warmer. Then, at her house apartment, he opens up a bit, they kiss, and another fire starts. Mike puts it out with his hands, which are not burned. Jessica now knows his secret. He warns her to keep away and runs off. Meanwhile, on two successive nights, two powerful-looking men emerge from a lake ‚Äî aliens in human camouflage bio-suits: the bounty hunter Eleven (), and Sixty-Six (Andrew Jackson). Masterson pays a visit to Mike and reveals what he knows about Mike's mother: she believed that she had been impregnated by an alien and that she left town before Mike was born. Mike is appalled and angered, a lamp bursts into flames, and he orders Masterson to leave. That night, Blaine sneaks into Mike's vacated motel room and is apprehended by Eleven, who kills him once he learns of Mike's connection to Jessica. The next day, Eleven goes to interrogate Jessica at the community centre, where James is intoning \\"Eleven\\" repeatedly, which Mike hears and then sees through extrasensory perception and precognitive visions. Jessica runs from Eleven when his interrogation of her turns aggressive. He corners her with a wall of fire. Mike arrives calling for her, sees her helpless in the pool and jumps in, only to be ambushed by Eleven who tries to drown him. Suddenly, Sixty-Six intervenes to save Mike. He tells Eleven he is in charge and subdues him with a burst of flames. Mike awakens in a car being driven by Sixty-Six, who explains that experiments on humans and other terrestrial life have gone on for thousands of years, his mother was one, and that to them Mike is a mere \\"viable specimen\\", but he refuses to allow anything to happen to Mike ‚Äî his son. Mike becomes upset and the car ignites. He runs into the woods. Eleven catches up to Sixty-Six and they fight a fiery duel to the death. Eleven wins, but Mike returns and challenges him. Holding nothing back, Mike's powers prove greater than Eleven's, destroying him utterly. Sixty-Six, wounded and dying from exposure to Earth's atmosphere, leaves Mike's questions about himself or others like him unanswered. Mike sets his body adrift and ignites it. Mike and Jessica leave town together, despite his misgivings about hurting her. She says they can \\"take precautions\\" and produces a fire extinguisher. Back at the community centre, Bart bullies James again, and discovers a fire in his hall locker. Cast Mark-Paul Gosselaar in 2008 Specimen was one of Marc Donato's earliest roles. ;Main ;Supporting Notes John Stoneham Jr. was also the stunt coordinator on the film, and performed stunts along with Thomas and Racki. Map of East Toronto Influences and genre Both a critic at TV Guide and reviewer Felix Vasquez Jr. assert that Specimen borrows heavily from the first two Terminator films (1984 and 1991), with Vasquez adding Firestarter (1984) and Fire in the Sky (1993). Vasquez characterizes the television movie as a science fiction melodrama. Production Background Director John Bradshaw is known for having made a number of low-budget thrillers made for television, including Specimen. Filming Though the story's action is mostly set in the fictional American town of Eastfield, principal photography took place in Toronto, 2-23 October 1995. Shooting locations include Centre 55 (corner of Main and Swanwick), a former East Toronto police station built in the 1900s, which served as the Eastfield police station. Gowan are included on the soundtrack. Music Besides the incidental music provided by the Electronic Dream Factory, the song which plays during the opening and end credits is Lawrence Gowan's \\"Holding This Rage,\\" the final track on his 1990 studio album Lost Brotherhood. Other songs from the same album on the film soundtrack include \\"Lost Brotherhood\\" and \\"Love Makes You Believe,\\" the second song which plays during the end credits. Release and reception Specimen was broadcast on television for the first time in 1996. Home media and streaming Specimen was released on VHS in 1997 by A-PIX Entertainment, and on DVD (Ardustry Home Entertainment) in 1999 by the newly formed Canadian film production and distribution company Trimuse Entertainment, and again in 2003. Specimen is available from the Canadian Hollywood Suite video on demand service and Amazon Prime. Critical response TV Guide's critic describes Specimen as \\"an adequate sci-fi thriller with a serviceable plot,\\" and a \\"model of low-budget film production,\\" which makes \\"good use\\" of its small- town locations, \\"doesn't ask its cast to do more than they are capable of,\\" and moves \\"at a sure clip.\\" However, the film fails to fulfill its potential: > Given the limitless range of powers a writer could give to alien beings, one > is rather disappointed that the four scribes ... couldn't come up with > anything more intriguing for these beings than the ability to create fire at > will. By the end of this feature, the viewer may feel like he or she has > spent the last hour and a half staring into a roaring campfire. One can't > fault the producers of this film for taking advantage of a story with which > the public seems to have an endless fascination, though one could have hoped > they might do something more interesting with it. Felix Vasquez agrees that the film's premise \\"has potential to be something bigger than its low budget trappings allows,\\" and that the film is \\"ridiculous and rather goofy.\\" However, he also finds the television movie \\"charming and entertaining\\" with \\"some decent performances,\\" adding that in spite of its flaws, Specimen is a \\"fine form of guilty pleasure that works around the low budget and hammy acting and taps in to the epic angle that it projects on to the audience.\\" Adaptation Felix Vasquez, who is also a comic book author- artist, saw Specimen for the first time on video in 1999 and liked it so much he made a comic book of the film.

Playback, April 24, 2018.  Plot   Season 1  The season begins 20 years in the future when an alien being abducts the last elephant on Earth, Tuko, from the African wildlife refuge where she's lived since she was orphaned as a baby. But before the Alien can leave Earth's atmosphere, its ship malfunctions and crash lands on a farm in North America. The crash happens just as Mr. Leopold, the foster parent who owns the farm, is about to take in Julia, a new foster kid, to join his other wards: Johnny, Tabby and Finn. Almost as soon as she arrives, Julia runs away but finding the last elephant on Earth in one of Mr. Leopold's cornfields makes her turn back. While Julia, Johnny, Tabby and Finn are not fast friends, they do learn to work together when they discover that an alien ship has crashed into the barn with an injured alien inside and another escaped insect alien loose on the farm. Julia, though initially wary of her newfound family, slowly learns to trust her fellow foster kids. But just as she grows more comfortable opening up to the others about the struggles she experienced prior to ending up at the Leopold farmstead, Johnny, Tabby and Finn start to reveal painful memories from their pasts. At the same time, the Alien, unfamiliar with Earth's natural environment and unable to communicate directly with its new caretakers, is steadily growing weaker. Fortunately, Abiona Maina, the wildlife activist who cared for Tuko at the refuge, manages to track the elephant down to Mr. Leopold's farm. After she's convinced that the Alien isn't evil, Abiona uses her knowledge of animals to save its life. The kids have a lot to deal with but, luckily, they also have each other to rely upon. This growing bond is especially helpful as it will take their combined talents to recapture the endlings released when the Alien's ship crashed into their barn. These include endlings that communicate in a variety of different ways, like frequencies too high or too low for humans to hear, endlings that are more bark than bite, as well as endlings that the kids want to keep forever, even though they shouldn't. Cast *Kamaia Fairburn as Julia, the latest addition to the Leopold household. Ever since the sudden loss of her father, Julia has just been mad‚Äîmad at the world, mad at her situation, mad at her sadness. However, the more time she spend with her new foster family the more she warms up to them. *Edison Grant as Johnny, the eldest child and first child to arrive at the Leopold household. Johnny works hard to make sure the farm feels like the first real home for the other kids just like it does for him. *Michela Luci as Tabby, the second youngest child and the engineer of the family. Tabby has a sharp tongue and quick wit which developed from constantly being let down by a lot of people in her life. *Cale Thomas Ferrin as Finn, the youngest child on the farm. Finn doesn't speak a word but communicates his love through his colorful drawings, his expressive face or his hugs. *Neil Crone as Mr. Leopold, the foster parent of the four kids. What Mr. Leopold is that what these kids need is someone to believe in them, because the world doesn't. *Oyin Oladejo as Tuko's caretaker, a wildlife activist who spent her childhood growing up around animals.

Liberals almost completely dominated Costa Rican politics during this period, to the point that many historians call this the \\"Liberal State\\". In Costa Rica there was no war between liberals and conservatives as was common in the rest of Latin America and even coup d'etats and de facto governments were mostly between liberal factions. The only conservative president of this period was Jos√© Rafael de Gallegos y Alvarado who did not end his term. Another conservative, Nicol√°s Ulloa Soto, never took office.ref>Msc.

The historiography tends to divide this historical period in two, the previous one to the civil war of 1948 and the subsequent one to it. During the first period from 1847 to 1948, the liberals almost completely dominated Costa Rican politics. The liberal hegemony only broke briefly with the government of Vicente Herrera Zeled√≥n (who however had been elected by the liberals) who ruled de facto for just over a year between 1876 and 1877. Even the dictator Federico Tinoco whose dictatorship lasted two years was also liberal. In addition, Costa Rican politics was then (and continues to be to some extent) eminently personalist, so political parties such as Civil, National, Peliquista and Republican revolved mostly around leaders and political figures and not ideologies although, in general terms, they usually be diffusely associated with liberalism. Costa Rican liberalism was also closely linked to the coffee-growing oligarchy and an important sector of the aristocracy. Attempts to create party alternatives not only formally ideological but more to the left were the Reform Party of Father Jorge Volio Jim√©nez, strongly influenced by the Catholic social teaching and Christian socialism and Manuel Mora Valverde's Workers and Peasants Block (which precisely it would break with the Reform Party after Volio's alliance with the liberal Ricardo Jim√©nez Oreamuno of the Republican Party) that would lead to the Costa Rican Communist Party. However, even after the war, an important influence of liberal thinking could be seen in the presidents emanated from opposition coalitions as well as within the Social Christian Unity Party. The National Republican Party led several liberals to the presidency, however, it would be under the government of perhaps its most famous president Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia that the reforms known as the Social Guarantees would be given for the benefit of the poorest classes and would be one of the triggers of the war of 48.http://geografiahistoriasecundaria.blogspot.com/p/la-crisis-de-la- republica-liberal-1914.html {  - bgcolor=#E4E8FF8657856785678 !

A National Constituent Assembly was also convened that drafted the 1949 Constitution, still in force, and also created the official positions of First and Second Vice presidents of the Republic. The National Liberation Party, of social democratic ideology and led by the war-winning leader Jos√© Figueres Ferrer would become the main political force after 48, but both Calderonistas and liberals would remain active allying with each other, which would allow the governments of Mario Echandi Jim√©nez and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Trejos Fern√°ndez. Following the merger of almost all the antiliberacionista opposition grouped in the Unity Coalition in the Social Christian Unity Party in 1983, this party and the National Liberation would form a solid bipartisanism so that all presidents between 1982 and 2014 belonged to one of these two parties. It is in 2014 that bipartisanship is broken with the coming to power of Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s Rivera, first president of the post-bipartisan stage and belonging to a party that was not linked to the two major traditional political tendencies (liberationism and calderonism) theCitizens' Action Party that had already been the main opposition force for two previous periods.http://www.primeraplana.or.cr/app/cms/www/index.php?pk_articulo=3694 {  - bgcolor=#E4E8FF8657856785678 !

Zimmerman, published in 2015 by Cambridge University Press, discussing relations between Poland's Jewish population and the Polish resistance in World War II. Zimmerman argues that polarized narratives, one picturing the Polish underground as anti-Semitic and murderous toward Jews and the other hand as heroically rescuing them, are oversimplified; in fact, different segments and members of the Home Army behaved in diverse ways. The book has received mostly-positive reviews for its evenhanded treatment of a contentious subject matter.  Contents  Researching the book took Joshua Zimmerman nine years. He lived for a year in Poland, interviewed witnesses (Jewish survivors as well as Home Army members), and examined archives in the United Kingdom and Israel. Zimmerman states that his intent was to present evidence without offering a verdict. The book falls into two parts. The first and shorter part covers prewar background, the initial German and Soviet occupations of Poland, and the early Polish resistance until 1941. The second part covers the remainder of the war, which saw the Polish resistance grow in strength, as well as the main stages of the Holocaust in Poland. The book has separate chapters on Polish rescue of Jews and on incidents of the killing of Jews by the Polish resistance.  Reception  Antony Polonsky, writing in 2015 in Yad Vashem Studies, praised the book as a \\"fair and dispassionate study\\" that seeks to \\"reach a conclusion on the actual behavior of the AK [Home Army]\\". Marisa Fox-Bevilacqua, reviewing the book that year for Haaretz, concluded by citing the Polish journalist Konstanty Gebert, who hoped the book would be translated into Polish and wrote, \\"The merit of the book is to show how complex the attitudes of the underground towards Jews were.\\" Wojtek Rappak, reviewing the book in 2016 for the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, called the book important and excellent and observed that Zimmerman's goal was \\"to challenge what he takes to be a long-established and overwhelmingly negative view of the Polish Underground, especially among 'professional Jewish historians'\\", while also challenging Polish historiography which presents the Underground as a \\"heroic and noble resistance movement,\\" with no tolerance allowed for criticism of the Underground. Michael Meng, in 2016 in The American Historical Review, wrote that the book tackles a \\"difficult and sensitive topic\\" and that the author \\"made a significant contribution to the historiography of Polish-Jewish relations.\\" That same year, Michael Berenbaum, in a review for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, wrote that the book is \\"timely... useful... and... good\\". He noted that it will upset both \\"Polish apologist historians\\" and Jewish historians \\"who seek simple answers\\". He also cautioned against selective reading of the book, as it has separate sections on rescue of Jews by the Poles and on Polish collaboration during World War II. Eva Plach, reviewing the book for the Slavic Review, also in 2016, wrote that it is \\"a book richly deserving of praise\\" and commented that Zimmerman's account discussed both examples of how, on occasion, some elements of the Polish Underground killed Jews and examples of how other elements provided aid to Jews, which \\"reminds us... why we cannot treat the Polish Underground as a homogeneous entity.\\" A 2016 review by Dariusz Libionka in the Polish-language Zag≈Çada ≈ªyd√≥w. Studia i Materia≈Çy (Holocaust Studies and Materials) journal was more critical. Libionka noted that Zimmerman's literature review on the subject matter was lacking, particularly for engaging with the extensive body of Polish literature on the subject and using content from Polish archives. He concluded that the book is disappointing for experts but may be valuable for newcomers to the field, particularly those who cannot read Polish, as the subject matter discussed in the book had been inadequately discussed in English literature. The review provoked an exchange of letters in that journal between Zimmerman and Libionka. According to Andrzej ≈ªbikowski, Zimmerman is less critical of the Polish underground than the Polish historian Adam Pu≈Çawski, who has written multiple books on the same subject. For example, while Zimmerman praises the bulletin published by the Home Army, Pu≈Çawski argues that the bulletin was of little importance at the time. In addition, according to ≈ªbikowski, Zimmerman's book is written with a foreign reader in mind and therefore spends considerable space on background information. Theodore R. Weeks, writing in 2018 in The Polish Review, called the book \\"a remarkably fair, objective and scholarly monograph\\" in a controversial topic area. Jadwiga Biskupska, writing the same year in H-Net, called the book \\"essential reading for modern Polish history and the Holocaust\\" and observed that it should be seen as a valuable contribution not only to those topics but also the literature on World War II resistance movements, particularly on Poland's Home Army.

About  Rangimoana Taylor was inspired to form Te Ohu Whakaari by his experiences in an Auckland-based theatre company called Statement Theatre alongside Nathaniel Lees, and provoked into action through an opportunity from artist Darcy Nicholas who was running the Wellington Arts Centre that was funded at the time by the Department of Labour. The Depot Theatre (that became Taki Rua) nurtured a philosophy to foster New Zealand work which also influenced Te Ohu Whakaari. Te Ohu Whakaari has lasting influence in New Zealand. Their theatrical practice combined western theatre traditions and MƒÅori customs with story telling and movement in a unique style. Much of their work was cooperatively devised and has not been published. Te Ohu Whakaari had a theatre-in-education programme which toured New Zealand. One of the Te Ohu Whakaari posters from 1986 is held in the collection of Te Papa Tongarewa and promotes a national tour (poster designed by Chris McBride).

Administratively it is part of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). Owing to the harshness of the climate the East Siberian Lowland is largely unpopulated. Inhabited centers are small and widely scattered. Chokurdakh, Olenegorsk, Nizhneyansk, Russkoye Ustye, Zyryanka, Srednekolymsk, Argakhtakh and Andryushkino are among the few towns in the area.Google Earth Geography The East Siberian Lowland is an extensive region located in the far north-east of Siberia. It is roughly triangular in shape and is about from east to west and from north to south, gradually rising and narrowing southwards, deeper into the continent. Except for a small section at the southern end the lowland region lies almost wholly north of the Polar Circle. The lowland includes the Yana-Indigirka, Kolyma and Aby lowlands, vast alluvial plains, swampy and dotted with thousands of lakes. These smaller lowland units are limited by residual ridges which break the generally flat relief, including the Kyundyulyun, Polousny Range, Ulakhan-Sis, Kondakov Plateau and Suor Uyata, as well as by isolated hills rising from the tundra, such as the Kisilyakh-Tas by the Alazeya.Topographic map - Chokurdakh Most of the kigilyakhs of Yakutia are found in these elevated areas of the East Siberian Lowland.Murzin Yuri Andreyevich, Kigilyakhi of Yakutia To the north the East Siberian Lowland is bound by shallow marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean, the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea. It includes the large New Siberian Islands and the smaller Medvezhy Islands, which form a continuum with the Eastern Siberian continental lowland region. To the west, south and southwest the lowland is limited by the East Siberian Mountains, including the Verkhoyansk Range, the Chersky Range and their foothills, as well as by the Alazeya Plateau, and to the east by the western end of the ranges of the Anadyr and the Yukaghir Highlands. The lowlands are crossed by slowly meandering rivers flowing mostly northwards. The main ones are the Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma and their tributaries, as well as the smaller Alazeya, Sundrun and Khroma rivers. Except for the very large ones, most of the rivers of the lowland freeze to the bottom in the winter. Continuous permafrost is prevalent in the East Siberian Lowlands, and permafrost-related formations such as alas thermokarst depressions and baydzharakh mounds are common throughout the region.Permafrost dynamics in the 20th and 21st centuries along the East Siberian transect { - valign=\\"top\\" A church in Russkoye Ustye with the flat lowland tundra landscape in the background.

The Verkhoyansk Sea was located at the eastern edge of the Siberian Craton. As centuries went by, most of the area became gradually filled with the alluvial deposits of modern rivers. Climate, flora and fauna The climate prevailing in the lowland is subarctic and severe, characterized by long, very cold winters. The average temperature in January is by the seashore and inland. In July the average temperature reaches by the seashore, but stays a chilly in the inland zone. Most of the lowland is covered by tundra. Only at the southern end in the upper Kolyma River basin there is a region where larch taiga can grow.Indigirka / Great Russian Encyclopedia in 35 vols. / Ch. ed. Yu.S.

There are wild reindeer herds in the Sundrun River that have a yearly migration pattern. The total reindeer population of the East Siberian Lowland, however, is small when compared with other areas, such as the Canadian Arctic.Ivan Sivtsev , The Sundrun population of wild reindeer, The Ninth North American Caribou Workshop, Kuujjuaq, Qu√©bec, Canada. Rivers and lakes are abundant in fish, such as Arctic char (golets), Siberian vendace, chir, muksun, nelma and omul.

Peter and his eldest brother Levin Jr. were sold by their owner at ages eight and six respectively, shortly after their mother had fled for a second time. After many years in Kentucky, the brothers were eventually sold to various slave-owning families in Florence and Tuscumbia, Alabama. It was there that Peter met and married Lavinia (Vina) Sisson, a household slave from a nearby plantation, on June 25, 1826. Peter's brother Levin died in 1831, leaving Peter without a living tie to his family. Through a verbal arrangement with his last owners, Joseph and Isaac Friedman, Peter secured his manumission for $500 in April 1850. Shortly thereafter, Peter arrived in Philadelphia, where he serendipitously met his youngest brother William Still, then serving as a clerk at the Anti-Slavery Office. Through his own efforts, and those of his family, friends, and supporters, Peter was eventually reunited with his wife Vina and children Peter, Levin, and Catharine, in 1854. They resided in Burlington County, New Jersey until Peter died of pneumonia in 1868.

The play takes place in New York City‚Äôs borough, the Bronx in the 1970‚Äôs, and details the experiences of the Puerto Rican Nieves family as its members grapple with the death of seven year old Puli Nieves, killed accidentally by a train while attempting to retrieve a baseball from the tracks. The plot of Miriam‚Äôs Flowers does not have a linear structure of progression. As it volleys between the past and present time within the context of the play, Miriam's Flowers juxtaposes cheerful, joy-filled memories involving Puli before his untimely death, with the grim realities faced by his surviving family as they all attempt to cope with his loss. Miriam's Flowers incorporates thematic elements centralizing around religious iconography and martyrdom, as well as the devastating manifestations of grief, touching particularly upon depression, self-harm, and suicide  Characters  * Miriam Nieves‚Äî A Puerto Rican girl of 16 * Delfina Nieves‚Äî Miriam‚Äôs Mother, 36 * Puli Nieves‚Äî Miriam‚Äôs seven year old brother * Enrique Rojas‚Äî Miriam‚Äôs boyfriend, a grocer, 35 * Nando Morales‚Äî Delfina‚Äôs lover, Puli‚Äôs father, 37  Setting  Set in the South Bronx, the duration of the plot of Miriam‚Äôs Flowers is described as taking place in the year 1975, from Summer to Winter of that year. Cruz writes that the set of the play should be dark and simple with the realest elements being the altars, which should be as detailed as possible. With all the candles lit and burning throughout the play, the home altar within the Nieves‚Äô apartment should have a statue of San Martin de Porres, with many candles burning (the choice of color optional); the church alter should have a white plaster ‚ÄúPieta‚Äù and have blue candles burning; the funeral home altar should have simple red candles burning. The bathtub and white coffin should appear within the same place on the stage.  Synopsis  The traumatic effect Puli‚Äôs death has had upon the Nieves family is immediately made apparent as the play opens to Miriam experiencing a nightmare about her brother's death, and Delfina comforting her. Puli‚Äôs manner of death and appearance post-mortem drastically affected the mental health of his family, as he died attempting to retrieve a baseball from the train tracks during a game of catch; his body was badly disfigured by the train accident, resulting in his arm being separated from his body as well as other visible traumas. While Delfina denies the truth of Puli‚Äôs death, Miriam reflects upon her happy memories with her brother, reminiscing about the times they would sing the songs of Puli‚Äôs favorite band, the Jackson Five, and talk about his impending destiny as the next Puerto Rican baseball star, calling him the future Roberto Clemente. While Nando imparts the machismo wisdom to Puli‚Äôs gravestone that he was unable to share during his son's life, he is consumed by depression and grief, and finds himself ostracized from his family despite his repeated attempts to emotionally connect with and provide for them. In an effort to experience the same pain her little brother did during his death, Miriam cuts herself and engages in rough sex with strange men, often mutilating herself in the process. Enrique, the grocer and Miriam‚Äôs boyfriend, contributes to Miriam‚Äôs habit of self-harm by supplying her with razors. Miriam believes that the blood of saints smells like violets, testing out her theory on the statue of San Martin, Jesus‚Äô pieta, and herself. She confides in the virgin Mary that she cuts pictures of flowers into her skin to feel beautiful and alive. As Delfina‚Äôs mental health declines, she turns to ritualistically making pigeon soup- the recipe to which she brought over from Puerto Rico and makes as comfort food. Delfina ceases to care for herself, causing Miriam to bathe her. Finally Delfina decides to commit suicide, taking her own life by drowning herself in the tub. Miriam discovers her mother's body, and before the paramedics arrive to take her away, Miriam carves tulips into Delfina‚Äôs arms with a razor, believing that when Delfina wakes up, she'll be reminded of beauty, renewal, and the impending spring.  Critical Reception and Analysis  In the wake of its first performance on stage in 1991, Miriam's Flowers received much acclaim from theatre critics, citing Cruz's ability to craft a haunting narrative showcasing gritty realism combined with a fierce sense of compassion. Grimly poetic, the script of this play is described as having a lyrical quality to its charismatic narration, ultimately constructing a poem made from people, where death and life have perilously merged. Critics of this play write that the disturbing reality of Miriam's Flowers, emphasized by Cruz's personal connection to its setting as the New York borough in which she was raised, translates to the multidimensional pain experienced by its characters as members of a marginalized community of poor, Latinx immigrants and their descendants. Analysts of this play conclude that the violence of poverty is demonstrated within Miriam's Flowers through the example of the direct, physically violent manner of Puli's death as a result of a lack of safety precautions within the South Bronx, as well as the metaphorical violence of his surviving family members' lives being pulled apart as a consequence of his loss of life.  Relevance to Latinx theatre and culture  The child of Puerto Rican immigrants, playwright Migdalia Cruz self-identifies as a Nuyorican born and raised in the Bronx. Cruz's Latinx identity and experiences growing up in the Bronx lends to the realistic nature of Miriam's Flowers, and by imbuing the plot with elements of Latinidad, as well as writing the characters of this play to be Puerto Rican, Migdalia Cruz has created an example of Latinx theatre centralizing around the experiences and performance of Latinx individuals. Within the plot of Miriam's Flowers, Cruz has fixed thematic elements of Latinx identity and culture, contributing to the sense of Latinidad within the piece. The statue upon which Miriam is fixated, San Martin, is a depiction of St. Martin de Porres, a Peruvian-born saint whose father was a Spaniard and mother was an enslaved, indigenous American. San Martin is the patron saint of individuals of mixed race, children, the poor, and the sick, and is especially favored by Hispanic and Caribbean communities. Roberto Clemente, Puli's inspiration and role model, was a Puerto Rican baseball star who advocated for the equitable treatment of Latin baseball players, and whose untimely death foreshadows Puli's. Following Puli's death, Nando exemplifies machismo, imparting unto his son's gravestone the wisdoms pertaining to manhood he was unable to pass on during his son's life, focusing namely upon the concepts of stoicism, bravery, and providing for/defense of women. Cruz also features code-switching within the play, visible especially in Miriam's scenes, where there are recognizable differences between her manner of speech in dialogue with Enrique and her address of the Virgin Mary, as many Puerto Ricans living within New York are able to speak up to five different dialects of Spanish and English.  Notable production  During her time as the Latino Chicago Theatre Company‚Äôs writer in residence, Migdalia Cruz‚Äôs Miriam‚Äôs Flowers debuted for the first time on September 5th, 1991 at the Firehouse Chicago, performed by members of the Latino Chicago Theatre Company. The production was directed by William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Payne, with costumes and lighting by Michelle Banks, and the set design was completed by Michael Ramirez.

There were 47 people on the island at the time. Twenty-one people were killed, including two who are missing and declared dead, and a further twenty- six people suffered injuries, many of whom suffered severe burns. The ongoing seismic and volcanic activity in the area as well as heavy rainfall, low visibility and toxic gases hampered recovery efforts over the week following the incident. Experts identified the event as a phreatic eruption: a release of steam and volcanic gases that caused an explosion, launching rock and ash into the air. Background Whakaari / White Island in 2013 Whakaari / White Island is an active andesite stratovolcano, situated off the north-northeast coast of the North Island of New Zealand in the Bay of Plenty. The volcano has erupted many times in recent history, including several times in the 1980s. A major eruption formed a new crater in 2000, and small eruptions occurred in 2012, 2013, and 2016. The volcano had been showing signs of unrest for several weeks before the 2019 eruption. In October 2019, volcanic tremors and sulphur dioxide gas were at their highest levels since 2016, indicating that an eruption was more likely to occur, and on 18 November, the volcano was rated at Volcanic Alert Level 2, indicating \\"moderate to heightened volcanic unrest\\", due to increased activity. On 24 November, two weeks prior to the eruption, a moment magnitude () 5.9 earthquake lasting approximately one minute with an epicentre located northeast of White Island occurred, and was felt by people throughout New Zealand as far south as Christchurch. Seismic activity can be a contributing factor to hydrothermic eruptions, due to a reduction of pressure within the geothermal system. The island is monitored by GNS Science with three web cameras, one seismograph, and a microphone to detect volcanic explosions. The organisation also makes regular visits to test water, gas and soil, and to survey surface deformation. Tourists regularly visit the island, primarily through White Island Tours. The organisation posted a statement on their web page before the eruption, which stated: Eruption The crater rim, captured by webcam one minute before eruption. Hikers can be seen walking in the centre of the image. The volcano erupted on 9 December 2019 at 14:11 NZDT (01:11 UTC). The ash plume rose into the air. It was initially believed that there were about 100 tourists on or near to the island when the eruption took place; later, this figure was revised to 47 people who were on the island at the time. Of these people, 38 were passengers on a shore excursion from the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, which was on a 12-day voyage around New Zealand and had berthed at the Port of Tauranga that morning. Some visitors were waiting for vessels to take them off the island at the time of the eruption. Tour operators and these vessels rescued 23 people from the island before it was officially declared unsafe. A passenger on one of the boats stated that his vessel attempted to first outrun the ash cloud before many on the vessel noticed a crowd of people in need of help on the jetty. Those who were brought onto the boat were aided by the original passengers who used water bottles, jackets and other clothing, inhalers, and eye drops. Another passenger told reporters that the boat he was on, which was about 200 metres offshore at the time of the eruption, launched an emergency inflatable and retrieved 23 people before returning to the mainland. Paramedics from the New Zealand Coastguard boarded the boat before it reached the docks to tend the injured. Noticing the eruption from the mainland shore, three commercial helicopter pilots conducted rescue missions to the island in their helicopters, bringing back twelve survivors. They also saw several bodies in the area, but concentrated on bringing back the survivors. The pilots reportedly attempted to return to the island to collect the bodies they had seen but were stopped by police; however, they were consulted later in order to collect the bodies once the area became more stable.

A passenger on a rescue boat stated that many of the injured had severe burns as many of them had worn just T-shirts and shorts for the day. At 18:35 on 9 December, media were told there was one confirmed fatality, with more likely to be dead as several were missing, while many were injured, seven critically. It was stated that it was still too dangerous for the emergency services to get onto the island to rescue people as it is covered in ash and volcanic material. Later the same day, officials declared that forty-seven people were on the island at the moment of the eruption: five were killed, 34 injured and rescued, while eight were missing and presumed dead. Three other people died in hospital the next days, bringing the confirmed death toll to eight. Six more bodies were found during an operation on the island, bringing the death toll to fourteen. On 14 December, it was announced that the death toll had risen to fifteen as another injured person died in hospital. A day later, an Australian citizen who was repatriated died in hospital, bringing the death toll to sixteen, plus two victims whose bodies had not been recovered. Another victim died from injuries in hospital, pushing the death toll to 19 including two missing people that were presumed dead. A further victim died at a hospital in Australia on 12 January 2020 bring the total to 20. Authorities were still working to recover two more bodies, although as of 15 January efforts were scaled down. Fatalities Over the days following the initial eruption, the death toll steadily rose as bodies were recovered from the island and as several of the severely burnt victims succumbed to their injuries. On 15 December it was announced that the death toll had risen to sixteen. The fatalities were identified as thirteen Australian tourists, three Americans and two New Zealand men who worked as guides for White Island Tours. Another victim, an American woman, succumbed to her injuries on 22 December, raising the confirmed death toll to 17 and the number of the American fatalities to four. An Australian man and an American man died of their injuries in January 2020, while the two missing people are officially declared as dead, bringing the death toll to twenty-one. Due to the severe injuries sustained by those on the island, identification of the deceased was carried out by a variety of individuals including a pathologist, a forensic dentist, and a fingerprint officer. This work was also aided by officers creating a profile on the victims, which included descriptions of appearance, clothing, photos, fingerprints, medical and dental records, and DNA samples. The information was then matched to evidence gathered from the deceased individual in the post-mortem examination. Injuries All but three of the survivors suffered severe or critical injuries and the vast majority were badly burned. They were initially taken to Whakatane Hospital, where they were triaged and stabilised before being transferred to other hospitals. Whakatane Hospital, Tauranga Hospital, and Waikato Hospital in Hamilton all activated their mass casualty plans. On 10 December, the Ministry of Health announced that twenty- five people had been transferred to the country's four burns units in Auckland (Middlemore), Hamilton, Lower Hutt and Christchurch, all of which were at capacity. On 11 December, it was reported that New Zealand had ordered of skin from the United States and Australia to treat patients following the eruption, some of whom have burns on up to 95% of their bodies. Three survivors suffered slight injuries. Thirteen injured Australians were airlifted to Australia from the night of 11 December to receive treatment in hospitals in Sydney and Melbourne. Three Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) planes, a C-130J-30 Super Hercules and two C-17 Globemasters, flew to Christchurch with specialist aircrew and medical equipment on board. Several Australian state governments also supplied aircraft to assist in the airlift. A total of twelve Australians were expected to be airlifted to their homeland. Missing after eruption Due to the eruption, those who were confirmed deceased by rescuers were left on the island in favour of those who were still alive. Without bodies to physically confirm the individuals' identities many were listed as missing instead of deceased until the body was formally identified. On 15 December authorities confirmed that the bodies of two victims had yet to be recovered and may have been swept into the sea. Police believe their bodies were initially near a stream, and were swept down the stream during a \\"significant weather event\\" on the night of 9 December.Sydney teen faces finding out his entire immediate family has died when he wakes from coma, news.com.au, 19 December 2019 On 23 January 2020, the New Zealand coroner declared the missing two to be dead. Aftermath Directly after the eruption, the volcanic alert level for the island was raised to 4, but was decreased by 16:30 on the same day to level 3. No further eruptive activity occurred, and on 12 December the volcanic alert level was lowered to 2, signifying \\"moderate to heightened volcanic unrest.\\" Volcanic tremor increased in the aftermath of the eruption, with small scale gas jetting and steam bursts observed on 13 December, however, the volcanic tremor level dropped that evening.

Ovation of the Seas postponed its departure from Tauranga until the morning of 11 December as police collected DNA samples from the cabins of the missing passengers. MƒÅori townspeople and members of the Ovation of the Seas passengers and crew, held a moment of silence honouring the ship's passengers and other victims. Later a representative of the MƒÅori began a karakia tau te mauri, a traditional blessing to settle the spirit before the ship left. The ship returned to Sydney on 16 December on an altered itinerary via Wellington and Picton. All passengers received the equivalent of one day's fare in on-board credit as compensation. All those injured and killed in the eruption, regardless of nationality, would be covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), who administer New Zealand's no-fault accident compensation scheme. The ACC Act generally prevents claims for damages for negligent acts in New Zealand, but it may be possible for the cruise ship passengers to sue in American courts under United States maritime law.  Legal case  In April 2020 legal action was commenced in Australia on behalf of relatives and Ovation passengers against the cruise-ship operator Royal Caribbean International.  Investigation  New Zealand Police launched an investigation into the disaster, in conjunction with the country's workplace health and safety regulator WorkSafe New Zealand. Responses Ray Cas, a professor emeritus from Monash University, and past president of the International Association for Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, published comments about the disaster through the Australian Science Media Centre, claiming that the incident was \\"a disaster waiting to happen\\". He felt that the island was too dangerous to allow the daily tour groups that visited. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that \\"the scale of this tragedy is devastating\\". On 10 December, Ardern met emergency services personnel who responded to the incident. The local member of Parliament Anne Tolley stated that the town was shattered by the disaster and their thoughts were with the victims and their families but did not rule out that the tours would end due to the disaster occurring. Tolley claimed the tours were \\"iconic\\" and a \\"centerpiece of the town's tourism.\\" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that \\"This is a very, very hard day for many families whose loved ones have been caught up in this terrible, terrible tragedy\\" and announced that an Australian Federal Police forensic team was sent to New Zealand to assist.

It was written by linguists Sergei Starostin, Anna Dybo, and Oleg Mudrak, and was published in Leiden in 2003 by Brill Publishers. It contains 3 volumes, and is a part of the Handbook of Oriental Studies: Section 8, Uralic and Central Asian Studies; no. 8.catalogue.nla.gov.au. Etymological dictionary of the Altaic languages / Sergei Starostin, Anna Dybo, Oleg Mudrak ; with assistance of Ilya Gruntov and Vladimir Glumov. Retrieved 12-9-2019. The work was sponsored by the Soros Foundation, the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, and the Russian Foundation of Humanities. The work was also supported by Ariel Investments in the Tower of Babel project. All work was conducted within Starostin's STARLING database, available online. Contents A map of the proposed Altaic language family The Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages contains 2,800 etymologies, among which half were newly developed by the team over 10 years.Starostin, S.A., Dybo, Anna V., and Mudrak, O.A. Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages BRILL, Leiden, 2003. There is an introduction at the beginning detailing the authors' defenses of the Altaic language family theory. It is claimed that there are two contact zones for the Altaic languages. The first, the Turko-Mongolian Contact, led to many Turkic and Mongolic words being used in both Turkic and Mongolic languages. The authors attempt to explain Turko-Mongolian shared words through loanwords from the 13th century as well as Turkic and Mongolic languages having a common ancestor. The example given is the comparison between Proto-Turkic a≈ïiga and Middle Mongol ara'a and aral. It is then claimed that the explanation for words with the root ara- being borrowed into Mongolic from Turkic is unsatisfactory, and that the words came from the common Altaic root a≈ïi, with the suffix -ga. The authors do the same with the Mongol-Tungus Contact, which they also believe the loanword explanation to be insufficient for. The second chapter of the introduction is a comparative phonology of the Altaic language family. The linguists say that the most common Altaic root structure is CVCV, and compared it with Japanese. They also reconstructed a consonant system for Altaic, and talk about the Khalaj h-, which yields h- in Khalaj but 0- in other Turkic languages. The dictionary views Altaic as extending to the 5th millennium B.C., and consisting of 3 groups - Turko-Mongolic, Mongol-Tungusic, and Korean-Japanese, using lexostatistical evidence to justify it. The inclusion of Korean and Japanese into the Altaic language family differs from the comparative works of earlier Altaicists.Norman, Jerry. Review: A New Look at Altaic. Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 129, No. 1 (January‚ÄìMarch 2009), p. 83 The dictionary makes distinctions between inherited words and interlingual borrowings. Reception The Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages, although aimed at providing further proof for the existence of the Altaic language family, received criticism from other linguists. Due to the 2,800 etymologies, it was seen as a large and important work in linguistics. It has been criticized for missing small details and requirements in its comparisons, and that the dictionary would have to need more evaluation by Stefan Georg,Georg, Stefan.

Nelson is an American urban planner, researcher and academic. He is Professor of Urban Planning and Real Estate Development at the University of Arizona. Nelson's research has been focused on metropolitan development policy and planning, applied demographic and economic analysis, fiscal impact assessment, public facility planning and finance, growth management/smart growth, urban development/redevelopment analysis and policy, real estate development policy, suburban and exurban development patterns, and economic development. Nelson is a fellow of the American Institute of Certified Planners, a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences and a fellow of the Growth and Infrastructure Consortium. He has also served as editor of Housing Policy Debate and associate editor of Journal of the American Planning Association and the Journal of Urban Affairs.  Education  Nelson received his B.Sc. in Political Science from Portland State University in 1972. While a consultant in planning and development along the West Coast, he continued his education at Portland State University, completing the Master of Urban Studies in Public Administration in 1976 and the Ph.D. in Urban Studies with concentrations in regional planning and regional science in 1984.  Career  After completing his Ph.D. in 1984, became Visiting Assistant Professor of Regional and Community Planning at Kansas State University. In 1985, he joined the University of New Orleans as assistant professor of urban and public affairs where, in 1986, he founded the Division of Urban Research and Policy Studies Research and was founding director of the university's undergraduate minor in urban studies and served as adjunct professor of social work at Southern University at New Orleans. In 1987, Nelson joined the Georgia Institute of Technology as Associate Professor of City Planning and in 1988 became jointly appointed as Associate Professor of Public Policy. In 1989, he founded the Graduate Certificate in Land Development. In 1991, Nelson founded the College of Architecture graduate co-op program. In 1992, he was promoted to Full Professor in the College of Architecture and the Ivan College of Liberal Arts at Georgia Tech. In 2002, as adjunct professor of law at Georgia State University, Nelson co-founded a dual planning and law degree program between the master of city and regional planning degree at Georgia Tech and the juris doctor (JD) degree at Georgia State University. In 2002, Nelson left Georgia Tech to join the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University as a Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning. There he founded the Urban Affairs and Planning Program at the Alexandria Center and served as its director until 2006 when he became the Co-Director of Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. In 2005, he created the university's first graduate dual degree, called 'sequential degree', programs. He also served as the Founding Director of Planning Academy at Virginia Tech. Nelson left Virginia Tech in 2008 to join the University of Utah as Presidential Professor of City and Metropolitan Planning. There he founded the Master of Real Estate Development program, the doctoral program in Metropolitan Planning, Policy and Design, and the Metropolitan Research Center. He also served as adjunct professor of finance in the David Eccles School of Business. In 2014, he became Presidential Professor Emeritus at the University of Utah and was appointed Professor of Urban Planning and Real Estate Development at the University of Arizona. From 2014 to 2016, he was the Associate Dean of Research and Discovery for the College of Architecture, Planning and Landscape Architecture at Arizona. In 2016 he was extended an additional appointment as Professor of Geography, Development and Environment in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences. There are numerous endowed positions and scholarships in Nelson's name including the Arthur C. Nelson Fellowship supporting women, people of color and indigenous descent, veterans, disabled persons, and members of the LGBTQ community studying planning awarded by the American Planning Association, the Arthur C. Nelson and Clark Ivory Doctoral Fellowship in metropolitan planning, policy and design students at the University of Utah, and the Arthur C. Nelson Fellowship in Urban Planning and Real Estate Development at the University of Arizona.  Research and work  Nelson is widely known for his work in several fields such as growth management/smart growth, suburban/exurban analysis, applied demographic and economic analysis to understand the future of metropolitan development patterns, and the theory and practice of development mitigation. With James B. Duncan, Nelson co-wrote Growth Management Principles and Practices. It explains growth management at the local, county, regional, and state levels, including an overall theory of growth management to mitigate externalities associated with underpriced infrastructure, conflicting land uses, and tax policies that subsidize urban sprawl. With Thomas W. Sanchez, Nelson identified many of the causes and consequences of exurbanization. While some have argued that exurbia exists because exurbanites have different housing and location preferences than suburbanites, Nelson's research has shown that exurbia is nothing more than the suburbanization of the suburbs. With James C. Nicholas and Julian Conrad Juergensmeyer, Nelson has advanced the application of proportionate share impact fees to mitigate the adverse effects of development on public facilities. Nelson is also known for applying demographic and economic trends to understand how America's metropolitan areas are changing. One of his key findings is that by the middle 2000s there were already more homes on large suburban lots than the market may need by the middle 2020s. Kaid Benfield wrote that Nelson predicted the 2007 collapse of the housing market because of oversupply of key housing types. According to Ellen Dunham-Jones, Nelson shows that for most metropolitan areas, perhaps all new development needs can be met on existing parking lots and existing low density/intensity developed sites. Nelson's recent work explores the interaction between public transit, land use patterns, economic development, and demographic settlement patterns. In 2019, Nelson's h-index was 51.

Williams later played nine seasons in the National Football League. Grambling inadvertently double-scheduled games on October 4 against and Oregon State and opted to play Oregon State, leaving Prairie View idle. Grambling told Prairie View of the scheduling problem in the spring and tried to reschedule the game with Prairie View for November 22, but the negotiations fell through. On November 26, the Southwestern Athletic Conference assessed a loss against Grambling's conference record, declaring the October 4 game against Prairie View to be a forfeit. On December 12, the SWAC commissioner stripped Grambling of its share of the conference co-championship, and then almost to add insult to injury, the athletic directors voted unanimously to send Southern as the SWAC's representative to the Pelican Bowl (over the other remaining co-champ, Jackson State); Grambling had just defeated Southern soundly only two weeks before in the first Bayou Classic to be played in the new Louisiana Superdome, and now the Jaguars could participate in a bowl game being billed as the black national championship.

The second act of A Madhouse in Goa, \\"Keeps Rainin' all the Time\\", is set 20 years after the first act, and reveals that David's real name is Daniel Hosani. Daniel became a famous author after publishing a novel centered around the events within the first act of the play, but eventually fell from popularity and succumbed to the effects of heavy drug usage, drinking, and stroke, becoming aphasic. His legal guardian, Heather, was also present at the Kistos Inn 20 years prior with Daniel and knows that his book does not tell the whole truth of what had actually transpired, distorting and white-washing the narrative to make it more appealing to readers. Dying from cancer, Heather arranges to sell the rights of Daniel's book to a Hollywood film producer seeking to adapt the novel into a film musical. Heather arranges for the money made from the movie deal to be donated to a selection of humanitarian organizations, only for the deal to never be realized.  Characters   \\"A Table for a King\\"  * David: early 20‚Äôs, American * Mrs. Honey: early 60‚Äôs, American * Costos: 18, Greek * Nikos: 30‚Äôs, Greek  \\"Keeps Rainin' all the Time\\"  * Daniel Hosani: late 40‚Äôs, American * Oliver: late 40‚Äôs, British * Heather: late 40‚Äôs, American * Dylan: Heather‚Äôs son, 19, American * Aliki: mid-20‚Äôs * Barnaby Grace: late 20‚Äôs, American  Relevance to LGBTQ Theatre  As an openly gay Jewish man, Sherman often writes characters who are marginalized from society, dramatizing the ‚Äúother‚Äù- societal outsiders identified as such due to their being gay, female, foreign, disabled, different in religion, class, or color. The cast of characters within Sherman‚Äôs A Madhouse in Goa showcases the intersectional element of his writing, featuring LGBTQ individuals, women, foreigners, and a disabled man, while the plot provides representation of the struggles faced by marginalized LGBTQ people in his depiction of David/Daniel, as this character is disowned by his family for being gay and experiences alienation from others due to his sexuality. The popularity of A Madhouse in Goa within the realm of theatre is supported by the noteworthy casts that have assumed roles within the play, but its relevance to the genre of LGBTQ theatre is supported by the play‚Äôs incorporation of characters that could be identified as members of LGBTQ community. Tied intrinsically to the genre of LGBTQ theatre due to its content and subject matter, A Madhouse in Goa not only highlights issues faced by LGBTQ individuals, it is also authored by Martin Sherman, a playwright whose history is steeped in gay theatre  Critical reception  In regards to this work‚Äôs critical reception, the responses to Sherman‚Äôs A Madhouse in Goa tend to vary, with some American critics describing the play as listless and sardonic, while others describe the play as tenacious and enthralling. Sherman wrote A Madhouse in Goa to reflect his own particular fears regarding the current state of the world at the time of the play‚Äôs creation in 1989. With these concerns informing the narrative of A Madhouse in Goa, its plot addresses atrocities plaguing the global community, including the AIDS crisis, terrorism, political unrest, nuclear fallout, and environmental issues. Sherman‚Äôs play has been characterized as satirical, providing commentary upon the consequences of moral blindness and its effects upon the individual as well as the global population, and although most reviewers agree that the humorous aspects of A Madhouse in Goa translate well to audiences, the numerous amount of cataclysmic events on the precipice of eruption within this play cause some critics to remark that the plot comes across as unfocused and overwhelming.

She is the 2020 Chinese national bronze medalist. She won the 2017 U.S. national junior bronze medal, before switching to representing China internationally.  Personal life  Lin was born in Frisco, Texas on March 12, 2003 to Chinese immigrants from Shanghai. Her parents both work in computer companies. Lin became a naturalized Chinese citizen in early 2019, and thus relinquished her U.S. citizenship, as China does not allow dual nationality.  Career   Early career Lin began skating in 2008. She was the 2016 U.S. national novice pewter medalist.  2016‚Äì2017 season  Lin was assigned to her first international event, 2016 JGP Slovenia, where she placed sixth. She won Midwestern Sectionals and advanced to the 2017 U.S. Championships, where she won bronze.  2017‚Äì2018 season  Lin again placed sixth at 2017 JGP Latvia to start the season. Competing in the senior division, she won the pewter medal at Midwestern Sectionals and qualified for the 2018 U.S. Championships. Lin was 21st after the short program at the 2018 U.S. Championships, and later withdrew from the free skating for unspecified reasons.  2018‚Äì2019 season  Lin opened her season with a fifth-place finish in the junior division at the 2018 Asian Open Figure Skating Trophy. She made her senior international debut at 2018 CS Nebelhorn Trophy, where she earned personal bests in all segments to place fifth overall. Lin then competed at 2018 CS Inge Solar Memorial ‚Äì Alpen Trophy, where she narrowly missed the podium, finishing in fourth 0.06 points behind Australia's Brooklee Han after a free skating comeback. Lin qualified to the 2019 U.S. Championships, but withdrew in January to begin the process of switching nationalities.  2019‚Äì2020 season  Lin officially switched to representing her parents' native country of China in 2019, as part of the country's initiative to recruit top athletes leading up to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. According to International Skating Union rules for switching nationalities, she was required to sit out international competition for a year dating from her last international appearance, making her ineligible for Challenger Series and Junior Grand Prix/Grand Prix events. Lin won the bronze medal at the 2019‚Äì20 Chinese Championships in September behind An Xiangyi and Chen Hongyi. Her coach, Chen Lu, told media that they were aiming to refine details and increase Lin's difficulty in the lead-up to the Olympics. The Chinese Skating Association arranged for Lin to train with coaches Eteri Tutberidze, Sergei Dudakov, and Daniil Gleikhengauz in Moscow, Russia for two weeks in October.  2020-2021 season  Lin was assigned to compete at the 2020 Skate America, and will be making her international debut for China.

Retrieved from MEASURE Evaluation (USAID). Gender relations are present in all institutions and gender sensitivity especially manifests in recognizing privilege and discrimination around gender; women are generally seen as disadvantaged in society. Gender sensitivity trainings are used to educate people, usually employees, to become more aware of and sensitive to gender in their lives or workplaces. They are becoming more popular in the United States, particularly in areas of the service industry, such as healthcare and education.  Gender sensitivity in reproductive health  Gender sensitivity in reproductive health is reliant on treating all clients with equal respect, regardless of sex, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, or age. Indicators of gender-sensitive service include: refraining from discriminating against or stereotyping clients on the basis of sex or gender, treating all clients with equal respect, offering gender sensitivity training to all employees, and providing adequate representation of female care providers. Gender-sensitive care also depends on informed consent to treatment for all clients. If service providers deliver gender-sensitive care, their clients might be more likely to seek further service from that provider.  Gender sensitization and children  Gender sensitivity is enacted through a process known as gender sensitization. Gender sensitization promotes equality for men and women by allowing men and women to view what is stereotypical of and reasonable for their gender. Therefore, teachers are in a position to teach children about gender sensitization through how they conduct their classroom and interact with their students.Barodia, S. (2015). Gender Sensitization and Education. International Journal of Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Studies (IJIMS), 2(4), 107-113. Teachers who are successful at sensitizing their students to gender at a young age can influence a change in children's thought processes, which positions them to break societal stigmas in childhood and throughout life. Teaching children to be sensitive to gender also relies heavily on the parents or guardians of the children. Children begin to develop their gender identity around two to three years old. At this age, gender identity is reinforced through messages from parents, whether gender sensitive or not.Palaniappan, Divya. (2019). Gender Sensitization: Raising Your Kids In A Gender-Neutral Environment. Retrieved from Business World Education. A common phrase that is not gender sensitive and might be heard by young children through their parents is ‚Äúboys will be boys.‚Äù Other examples of non-gender-sensitive reinforcement of gender includes teaching children that pink is an objectively feminine color and blue is an objectively masculine color, as well as forcing young girls to play with dolls and boys to play with trucks. Educating children about gender identities that do not conform to the gender binary helps to break the stigma associated with these identities.  Global gender sensitivity  Gender plays a large role in Indian thought processes. The separation of boy and girl indicators in India creates distance between men and women. Indicators of masculinity in boys include cars, the color blue, and superheroes; indicators of femininity in girls include dolls, the color pink, and princesses. Sweden is making a strong effort to become more gender sensitive. Sweden recently added the word ‚Äúhen‚Äù‚Äîa gender-neutral pronoun‚Äîto their common language. This promotes a gender-neutral way of thinking for children.

The film stars Neil Breen, Sara Meritt, Siohbun Ebrahimi, Denise Bellini, Marty Dasis, Brad Stein, John Smith Burns, Art MacHenster, Greg Smith Burns, Ada Masters, and Jason Moriglio. The film centers around identical twin brothers, Cade and Cale Altair, who become hybrid Artificial Intelligence entities, who are torn in different directions to achieve justice for humanity. Twisted Pair was theatrically released in the United States on October 3, 2018, by Neil Breen Films, LLC.  Plot  During their youth, Cade and his identical twin brother Cale (both portrayed by Neil Breen) were abducted by an unknown power and modified to become Humanoids, secret agents who are out to stop evil. Cale didn't fit in with the program and was fired. Cade, as an adult, is introduced on a mission where he is protecting troops. He returns to headquarters and meets with his boss, who suggests that he take a vacation. Cade laments not having seen his brother since before he became a Humanoid. Cale meets with a lawyer, an executive and the President of The Bank and interrogates them for a while before he shoots one of them in the leg and leaves to do pills with his girlfriend Donna (portrayed by Siohbon Ebrahimi). Cade's boss tells him about programmable virtual reality and how a man named Cuzzx (portrayed by Greg Smith Burns) is going to use it to conduct the biggest cyber and terror attack ever. Cade decides to investigate, but while investigating around town he bumps into Alana (portrayed by Sara Meritt). He offers to buy her a drink to apologize, but she says she's very busy and leaves. Cade attempts to make a date with the woman, before she departs. She doesn't come back but later he sees her and decides to follow her home. Cade breaks into her house and they fight, before they abruptly stop fighting, revealing that they'd been in a relationship the whole time. Cade breaks into a Cuzzx lab to find clues for his mission. Cade finds four guys wearing VR goggles who are in some kind of trance, and in the next room, a very old person dressed like Cuzzx meeting with people. The men disappear, due to the programmable virtual reality and Cade reports back to his boss. Cade takes Alana, his girlfriend, out to dinner, and a mysterious man stabs Cade's homeless friend, taking his cell phone. Meanwhile, Cale tracks down and murders a rich executive, but the police find no evidence because Cale picked up the shell casings. He did, however, drop a syringe. Cade pretends to be a rich investor who wants to give money to the Cuzzx Empire, which gets him a tour of Cuzzx' house. Donna, Cale's pillhead girlfriend, breaks up with him and then runs into Cade, demanding to know where she can get more drugs and why he shaved his beard. Cade responds by going \\"I never had a beard\\" repeatedly. He gives the girl some money to find a place to stay and they hug. Alana sees and gets jealous. Cade then decides to take down the Cuzzx Empire and goes into the boiler room to enact his plan. After his empire is destroyed, Cuzzx flees the country. Cade goes home and Alana pulls a gun on him, as she was working for Cuzzx the whole time. They shoot each other, and Alana dies in his arms. In the virtual reality forest, Cade and Alana reunite, they embrace and Alana tells him she loves him, and then disappears. The film ends with Cade addressing the audience, accepting the loss of Alana, and stating that humanity will eventually live in a virtual universe. Before the credits, the message \\"Cade Altair will return\\" appears onscreen.  Cast   Development  On September 2, 2017, Twisted Pair began filming at Nevada State College. In April 2018, during post-production on Twisted Pair, Breen released a trailer for the film.  Release  Twisted Pair was theatrically released in the United States on October 3, 2018 and in the United Kingdom on February 9, 2019, by Neil Breen Films, LLC.  Reception  /Film gave a review of the trailer with \\"Breen shows up playing a pair of identical twins standing in front of what looks like a screensaver. Things just get better/weirder from there, and we're treated to one of the worst (best?) fake beards in history. Watching this trailer, you start to think that maybe this is a very elaborate joke, and Breen is just messing with us. But I assure you, Breen is serious, and that makes it even better.\\" Twisted Pair has received negative reviews by several critics. Gena Radcliffe of The Spool gave a negative review by stating \\"The deeply strange Neil Breen returns with an even more deeply strange entry in his filmography of homespun, barely-coherent psychological thrillers.\\" She elaborated by stating \\"What little plot exists is incoherent... Breen himself doesn't understand what's happening in his own movie, or, at least, what kind of movie he wants it to be. He drops phrases like \\"artificial intelligence\\" and \\"programmable virtual reality,\\" and they don't have any meaning or bearing on the plot. Though he describes Twisted Pair in publicity material as a \\"psychological thriller,\\" it is most definitely not that. What it does have are some elements of science fiction, a murder mystery, espionage, romance, and even a touch of domestic drama, but none of it is cohesive, and none of it goes anywhere. They're all their own little mini-plots, like Short Cuts if it was made by an alien who only had a rudimentary grasp of English.\\" She mentions a positive element of the film with \\"There's a seed of something interesting planted here ‚Äì the villain looks like a dollar store Elvis Costello, carries a bowl of diamonds around, and talks like his voice is being disguised on an episode of Dateline NBC. Unfortunately, time that could have been spent developing this character, or at least explaining who he is and what motivates him (and why his scarf keeps changing colors), is wasted on long scenes of Breen indifferently creeping around in an empty laboratory.\\" Grady Bolding of Cultured Vultures gave a negative review by stating \\"It has its moments of hilarity which kill any boredom that might ensue, but otherwise, it's a raging fire that cannot be put out.\\" Bolding describes the positive elements of the film with \\"The only strength with Neil Breen's film is quite similar to what the great Tommy Wiseau did with The Room. While The Room can be seen as an unintentional takedown of the superficiality of Hollywood drama films, Breen's film(s) provide an antithesis to the overly-hyped mercenary-for-hire/vigilante agent films seen today in American theaters. American culture has always championed the idea of a lone warrior setting out to right the wrongs of society, if not the world. Twisted Pair efficiently reflects this part of American culture, but provides unintentional satire. The All-American hero is a noticeably aged Neil Breen who either makes his enemies think about their actions or makes them pay for it. He is not a stocky, barrel-chested figure like Matt Damon or Chuck Norris. He's so aged and withered that it makes him 100% average.\\" Bolding summarizes Breen's work by stating that \\"any audience can ‚Äì and will ‚Äì laugh at Neil Breen's mediocrity, but they will easily be able to project themselves into what he's trying to accomplish. Breen fails across the board, but he gives us something worth laughing at and enjoying. In this respect, Breen accomplishes his mission when it comes to the most basic tenant of producing a film: providing entertainment.\\" Diego Olgu√≠n of The Charlatan also gave a negative review by stating \\"The surreal editing makes the film almost incomprehensible; the soundtrack is pretty much stock trailer music; the special effects look straight out of some mid 1990s straight-to-VHS movie; and the script is full of nonsensical dialogue, amplified by the cast's wooden deliveries. However, no film must reach perfection in order to be enjoyable, and this is a clear example of this.\\" Olgu√≠n continues by discussing some of the positives of the film, \\"While Twisted Pair fails in every level in being an action film with social commentary, it does succeed as an unintentional comedy. While the CGI looks cheap and fake, that only adds to the fun during scenes where explosions awkwardly fill a classroom. Breen's acting capabilities rival Tommy Wiseau's in how weird and inhuman they are. Watching him trying his best to emote sadness as he tries to persuade his brother (which is Breen with a cheap beard and a hoodie) to turn himself in to the cops is something to be witnessed‚Äîpreferably with a few friends and some drinks. There is also a sense of honest effort on the film, crappiness aside. You can feel that Breen tried his best to deliver a legitimately good movie, like a modern-day Ed Wood‚Äîfamous only for people roasting his past films, but still not giving up.\\"  Sequel  On March 11, 2019, Breen confirmed that a sequel is in development.

Biography He received his artistic training from Joseph De Cauwer and Ferdinand de Braekeleer. When he was only eighteen, he took part in the Salon in Ghent. From 1821 to 1836, he made his living doing decorative and furniture painting. After 1836, he was able to devote himself entirely to his art. He moved to Antwerp in 1837, to work with his former teacher, De Braekeleer. While there, he came under the influence of the works of David Teniers and Adriaen van Ostade; particularly those that depicted villagers and peasants having fun. The resulting works are nostalgic in nature: pleasant, and reminiscent of similar works from the 17th century. A story line is always implied. During his career, he had successful exhibitions at the Salons in Antwerp and Brussels, as well as in Ghent. His paintings became very popular and were often referred to as \\"Vennemannekens\\". As with many prolific 19th century painters, he used a pitch-based paint that does not preserve color very well; leaving his works less colorful and nuanced than they were originally. His daughter, also became a painter, but worked in a more Realistic style.

The island is flat and approximately 15m above sea level with access from the mainland via a raised shellbank for approximately two hours either side of low tide. The rocks surrounding the island are a popular day trip and fishing destination, although access to the top of the island is difficult due to the steep cliffs around it. There have been numerous other places named \\"Motukaraka\\" throughout New Zealand, including in the Auckland suburb of Green Bay, and in the Hokianga Harbour. Most historical accounts differentiate this island as being 'near Howick'. History Historian Percy Smith records that in the late 18th century Motukaraka Island was a heavily fortified pƒÅ of about 100 members of the tribe NgƒÅti PƒÅoa. Around this time a party from NgƒÅti Rongo, seeking revenge for a previous attack by NgƒÅti PƒÅoa, stormed the island. They cut kauri spars to serve as scaling ladders and attacked the site at dawn. The ensuing massacre wiped out almost all inhabitants, including the NgƒÅti PƒÅoa chief Taeiwi. The island has been uninhabited since this time. Clianthus puniceus, a critically endangered species of plant was recorded as being present on the island in the late 19th century but all expeditions since this time have not discovered the species and it is no longer endemic to the island. Motukaraka Island was the first historic category scenic reserve in New Zealand, gazetted in March 1905. In the 1920s the island was used for various farming purposes, including growing karaka, breeding rabbits and farming potatoes, with a chute built to drop the bags of potatoes down unto waiting carts. Although the island was used for farming it was not inhabited or settled. In 1965 a fire broke out on the island and burned unchecked for three days. All plants except a few coastal pohutukawa were destroyed in the fire. It has also been known variously as Flat Island, Motu Ika (Fish Island), and Reserve Island. Conservation and recreational use Motukaraka Island from Beachlands Many expeditions in the 1990s and 2000s have taken place to study the recolonized flora and fauna and remove pests. Pest eradication appears to have been successful but the loss of the mature plants and trees in the fire has facilitated the growth of weeds. At various times stairs have been present to allow easy access to the island but drainage issues and the harsh environment have required their removal. Despite this the island is a popular walk and fishing area.

Because of a combinatorial equivalence between binary trees and triangulations of convex polygons, rotation distance is equivalent to the flip distance for triangulations of convex polygons. Rotation distance was first defined by Karel ƒåul√≠k II and Derick Wood in 1982. Every two -node binary trees have rotation distance at most , and some pairs of trees have exactly this distance. The computational complexity of computing the rotation distance is unknown. Definition Tree rotation A binary tree is a structure consisting of a set of nodes, one of which is designated as the root node, in which each remaining node is either the left child or right child of some other node, its parent, and in which following the parent links from any node eventually leads to the root node. (In some sources, the nodes described here are called \\"internal nodes\\", there exists another set of nodes called \\"external nodes\\", each internal node is required to have exactly two children, and each external node is required to have zero children. The version described here can be obtained by removing all the external nodes from such a tree.) For any node in the tree, there is a subtree of the same form, rooted at and consisting of all the nodes that can reach by following parent links. Each binary tree has a left-to-right ordering of its nodes, its inorder traversal, obtained by recursively traversing the left subtree (the subtree at the left child of the root, if such a child exists), then listing the root itself, and then recursively traversing the right subtree. In a binary search tree, each node is associated with a search key, and the left-to-right ordering is required to be consistent with the order of the keys. A tree rotation is an operation that changes the structure of a binary tree without changing its left-to-right ordering. Several self-balancing binary search tree data structures use these rotations as a primitive operation in their rebalancing algorithms. A rotation operates on two nodes and , where is the parent of , and restructures the tree by making be the parent of and taking the place of in the tree. To free up one of the child links of and make room to link as a child of , this operation may also need to move one of the children of to become a child of . There are two variations of this operation, a right rotation in which begins as the left child of and ends as the right child of , and a left rotation in which begins as the right child of and ends as the left child of . Any two trees that have the same left-to-right sequence of nodes may be transformed into each other by a sequence of rotations. The rotation distance between the two trees is the number of rotations in the shortest possible sequence of rotations that performs this transformation. It can also be described as the shortest path distance in a rotation graph, a graph that has a vertex for each binary tree on a given left-to-right sequence of nodes and an edge for each rotation between two trees. This rotation graph is exactly the graph of vertices and edges of an associahedron. Equivalence to flip distance The flip graphs of a pentagon and a hexagon, corresponding to rotations of three-node and four- node binary trees Given a family of triangulations of some geometric object, a flip is an operation that transforms one triangulation to another by removing an edge between two triangles and adding the opposite diagonal to the resulting quadrilateral. The flip distance between two triangulations is the minimum number of flips needed to transform one triangulation into another. It can also be described as the shortest path distance in a flip graph, a graph that has a vertex for each triangulation and an edge for each flip between two triangulations. Flips and flip distances can be defined in this way for several different kinds of triangulations, including triangulations of sets of points in the Euclidean plane, triangulations of polygons, and triangulations of abstract manifolds. There is a one-to-one correspondence between triangulations of a given convex polygon, with a designated root edge, and binary trees, taking triangulations of -sided polygons into binary trees with nodes. In this correspondence, each triangle of a triangulation corresponds to a node in a binary tree. The root node is the triangle having the designated root edge as one of its sides, and two nodes are linked as parent and child in the tree when the corresponding triangles share a diagonal in the triangulation. Under this correspondence, rotations in binary trees correspond exactly to flips in the corresponding triangulations. Therefore, the rotation distance on -node trees corresponds exactly to flip distance on triangulations of -sided convex polygons. Maximum value define the \\"right spine\\" of a binary tree to be the path obtained by starting from the root and following right child links until reaching a node that has no right child. If a tree has the property that not all nodes belong to the right spine, there always exists a right rotation that increases the length of the right spine. For, in this case, there exists at least one node on the right spine that has a left child that is not on the right spine. Performing a right rotation on and adds to the right spine without removing any other node from it. By repeatedly increasing the length of the right spine, any -node tree can be transformed into the unique tree with the same node order in which all nodes belong to the right spine, in at most steps. Given any two trees with the same node order, one can transform one into the other by transforming the first tree into a tree with all nodes on the right spine, and then reversing the same transformation of the second tree, in a total of at most steps. Therefore, as proved, the rotation distance between any two trees is at most . By considering the problem in terms of flips of convex polygons instead of rotations of trees, were able to show that the rotation distance is at most . In terms of triangulations of convex polygons, the right spine is the sequence of triangles incident to the right endpoint of the root edge, and the tree in which all vertices lie on the spine corresponds to a fan triangulation for this vertex. The main idea of their improvement is to try flipping both given triangulations to a fan triangulation for any vertex, rather than only the one for the right endpoint of the root edge. It is not possible for all of these choices to simultaneously give the worst-case distance from each starting triangulation, giving the improvement. also used a geometric argument to show that, for infinitely many values of , the maximum rotation distance is exactly . They again use the interpretation of the problem in terms of flips of triangulations of convex polygons, and they interpret the starting and ending triangulation as the top and bottom faces of a convex polyhedron with the convex polygon itself interpreted as a Hamiltonian circuit in this polyhedron. Under this interpretation, a sequence of flips from one triangulation to the other can be translated into a collection of tetrahedra that triangulate the given three-dimensional polyhedron. They find a family of polyhedra with the property that (in three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry) the polyhedra have large volume, but all tetrahedra inside them have much smaller volume, implying that many tetrahedra are needed in any triangulation. The binary trees obtained from translating the top and bottom sets of faces of these polyhedra back into trees have high rotation distance, at least . Subsequently, provided a proof that for all , the maximum rotation distance is exactly . Pournin's proof is combinatorial, and avoids the use of hyperbolic geometry. Computational complexity As well as defining rotation distance, asked for the computational complexity of computing the rotation distance between two given trees. The existence of short rotation sequences between any two trees implies that testing whether the rotation distance is at most belongs to the complexity class NP, but it is not known to be NP-complete, nor is it known to be solvable in polynomial time. The rotation distance between any two trees can be lower bounded, in the equivalent view of polygon triangulations, by the number of diagonals that need to be removed from one triangulation and replaced by other diagonals to produce the other triangulation. It can also be upper bounded by twice this number, by partitioning the problem into subproblems along any diagonals shared between both triangulations and then applying the method of to each subproblem. This method provides an approximation algorithm for the problem with an approximation ratio of two. A similar approach of partitioning into subproblems along shared diagonals leads to a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for computing the rotation distance exactly. Determining the complexity of computing the rotation distance exactly without parameterization remains unsolved, and the best algorithms currently known for the problem run in exponential time.

Pascucci\\" () is an inactive tank battalion of the Italian Army based in Cordenons in Friuli Venezia Giulia. Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 15 July 1976 the 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" was disbanded and the next day its XI Bersaglieri Battalion became the 11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\", while its XIII Tank Battalion became the 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pascucci\\". As the war flag and traditions of the 182nd Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" were assigned to the 11th Caprera the 13th Pascucci was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the XIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had been formed by the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment in October 1941 and sent to Italian Libya in August 1942 to bring the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment p to strength for the Battle of Alam el Halfa. The XIII fought to annihilation in the Second Battle of El Alamein and by 5 November 1942 had ceased to exist. After World War II the XIII Tank Battalion was reformed in Sacile in 1961 as tank component of the 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\", which was the armored formation of the Infantry Division \\"Folgore\\". Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 13th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment Lieutenant Luigi Arbib Pascucci, who had served in the XIII Tank Battalion \\"M\\" and was killed in action on 4 November 1942 during the Second Battle of El Alamein. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Brescia\\". In 1986 the Italian Army disbanded the divisional level and the Mechanized Brigade \\"Brescia\\" joined the 3rd Army Corps in Milan on 1 October 1986. On the same date the 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pascucci\\" was transferred to the Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and therefore the 13th Pascucci was reduced to a reserve unit and transferred to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Mantova\\" on 10 December 1989. The 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O.Pascucci\\" was disbanded on 31 March 1991 and its flag transferred to the Shrine of the Flags at the Vittoriano in Rome.

Life  Birthplace plaque Ludwik Maurycy Landau was born into a family of intelligentsia in Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki on 31 May 1902. He graduated in law at Warsaw University. After graduation he was employed at the Central Statistical Office and at the Institute for Research into Business Cycles and Prices (Instytut Bada≈Ñ Koniunktur Gospodarczych i Cen) and the Institute of Social Economy (Instytut Gospodarstwa Spo≈Çecznego). His study on social income in Poland around 1929‚Äì1933, co-authored with Micha≈Ç Kalecki, was pioneering. Landau's 1936 firing from the Institute for Research into Business Cycles and Prices (together with Kalecki and Marek Breit) was seen as politically motivated and engineered by a senior member of the Polish government, the economist and politician Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski. During the German invasion of Poland and the siege of Warsaw, Landau took part in civil defense. During the subsequent occupation, he continued his research. He participated in underground education programs and worked with the Polish Underground State, preparing reports on the status of the wartime Polish economy. He supported the wartime Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Freedom, Equality, Independence, helped design their early wartime manifesto on the economy, and in 1940‚Äì1942 edited their underground newspaper. In August 1940 he was forced to move to the newly created Warsaw Ghetto. He was able to escape from the ghetto with his family and spent the next couple of years in hiding in the city's W≈Çochy district. Around 1943 and 1944 he was blackmailed by szmalcowniks. On 29 February 1944, after leaving home, he went missing; in the next days, the Gestapo arrested his family; his daughter committed suicide, and his wife was shot.  Works  Landau published a number of academic papers and studies pertaining to economics and law. One of his areas of expertise was the distribution of gross national income among the social classes. From the start of the occupation, Landau kept a diary discussing the effects of the wartime conditions on the Polish people, including the country's Jews. The diary contained valuable statistical data.

She belonged to the family of the Ezzonids, who became prominent in Lower Lorraine in the 11th century.  Biography  Ida was the daughter of Mathilde, a sister of King and Emperor Otto III and Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia. Because of his marriage into the royal family and his considerable wealth, Ezzo and his offspring became prominent in the 11th century; his dynasty is called the Ezzonids. Ezzo and Mathilde had ten children, all of whom held important positions in Lower Lorraine.Beuckers 1993, p.7. Ida was one of the younger children. Her exact birthdate is uncertain,Beuckers 1993, p.43. but was certainly before 1025, when her mother Mathilde died. Her father Ezzo died in 1034.Uhlirz 1959. Ida and her sister Sophia were most likely educated in Gandersheim Abbey. They left Gandersheim in 1026 and entered the convent of St. Maria Altenm√ºnster in Mainz. Only one year later, in 1027, they had to return to Gandersheim, because of an ongoing conflict between the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Hildesheim (Gandersheim Conflict). In 1028, they were able to go back to Mainz. However, Ida returned to Gandersheim for good in 1031, when Aribo, the Archbishop of Mainz, died. Her sister Sophia had already died in Mainz.Beuckers 1993, p.43-45. No later than 1038, Ida became abbess of St. Maria of Gandersheim, which was part of Gandersheim Abbey. She got her sanctification from Bishop Godehard of Hildesheim,Beuckers 1993, p.149. who died on 5 May 1038.Berges 1964. At the latest in 1049 (and probably before 1039),Beuckers, p.43, 148. Ida became abbess of St. Maria im Kapitol in Cologne. As her brother Herman II was Archbishop of Cologne from 1036-1056,Wisplinghoff 1969. it is likely that he helped her to gain the position. On 5 July 1049, she was certainly present at the altar dedication in the church St. Maria in Kapitol, executed by Pope Leo IX.Beuckers 1993, p.43-45. Emperor Heinrich III was also there during the dedication, which highlights the significance of the church and its abbess.Knapp 2009, p.100. Ida died on 7 or 8 April 1060 and was buried in the church of St. Maria im Kapitol.Beuckers 1993, p.43-44. There, her sarcophagus can still be visited today.  Legacy  St. Maria im Kapitol The church of the convent St. Maria im Kapitol was newly built around 1040/45. It is regarded as one of the most important constructions of the 11th century in the Holy Roman Empire.Beuckers 1993, p.149-155. The new building is mainly attributed to Ida. Some scholars also point to a very likely participation of her brother, Archbishop Herman II.Knapp 2009, p.71, 98. The church probably contained several furnishings, of which two artefacts are still preserved today: the wooden doors and the Herimann-Kreuz (crucifix). The wooden doors are seen as one of the most important pieces of woodcarving of the High Middle Ages.Beuckers 1999, p.125. As demonstrated by dendrochronology, they were built around 1044, during Ida's time as Abbess, and thus are regarded as her legacy. The Herimann-Kreuz (crucifix) is mostly seen as a joint endowment of the siblings Herman II and Ida.Beuckers 1993, p.155-162. Both are depicted with their names on its backside. The Crucifix is a remarkable artefact, as the head of Christ is replaced by a woman's head. Today, it can be seen in the Di√∂zesanmuseum of Cologne.Surmann 1999, p.7-18. Different scholars believe that Ida is responsible for the production of the Hidda-Codex of GerresheimBeuckers 1993, p.164-168. and the Hidta-Codex of Meschede.Weilandt 2013, p.57-74 The Hidda-Codex is presumed to be the oldest preserved illuminated manuscript from the High Middle Ages in Cologne.Beuckers 1993, p.164-168. However, the determination of their age and their donor are part of an ongoing scientific discussion.Riemer 2013, p.39. Ida might also have given a column with a crucifix for the collegiate church in Essen, where her sister Theopanu was abbess. The crucifix is not preserved, but, there still exist two metal plates, which state an abbess named Ida as donor.Beuckers 1993, p.163-164. Ida is represented in one of the statues on the first floor of the tower of the City hall in Cologne. These figures represent notable persons of the city.  References   Bibliography  Berges, Wilhelm.

It is operated by the Transports R√©gionaux Neuch√¢telois (Neuch√¢tel Regional Transport, TRN) and has connected the municipalities of Les Ponts-de-Martel and La Sagne in the Vall√©e des Ponts (also called the Vall√©e de la Sagne) with La Chaux-de-Fonds since 26 July 1889.  Route  La Chaux-de-Fonds from the Vall√©e de la Sagne The railway was built by the Ponts‚ÄìSagne‚ÄìChaux-de-Fonds Railway (French legal name: Chemin de fer R√©gional La Chaux-de-Fonds - Les Ponts-de-Martel, PSC) as a metre-gauge line and is just over 16 kilometres long. It has one track and train crossings are now only possible in La Sagne. Since 28 November 1893, it has connected in La Chaux-de-Fonds at a common station with the also metre-gauge Saignel√©gier‚ÄìLa Chaux-de-Fonds railway (SC), which since 1 January 1944 has been part of the Chemins de fer du Jura (CJ). The line leaves La Chaux-de-Fonds station (at 994 metres above sea level) on a steep gradient of 4.0 percent and reaches its high point of 1120 metres after passing through a tunnel in Reymond. From there, the line initially descends at 3.1 percent into the high valley. At the foot of a spur that it has just crossed, the line runs in an almost straight line to La Sagne and from there with a descent of only 1.6 percent to Les Ponts-de-Martel, including a short climb of 1.0 percent. There is a local depot in Les Ponts-de-Martel formed of several sidings. In May 1915, the Saignel√©gier‚ÄìLa Chaux-de-Fonds Railway opened a transporter wagon yard in La Chaux-de-Fonds. The same transporter wagon system was also shared by the Chemins de fer des Montagnes Neuch√¢teloises from 1966, which began the transport of standard-gauge railway wagons on the line to Les Ponts-de-Martel. However, the CMN phased out all freight traffic. The transporter wagon yard was also used by the CJ for several years but it no longer exists.  Connecting lines The standard-gauge station in La Chaux-de-Fonds was opened on 2 July 1857 and was the temporary terminus of the line to Le Locle, which was opened by the Compagnie Jura industriel (JI). The continuation to Convers was opened by the same company on 27 November 1859 and provided a connection to Neuch√¢tel until mid-1860, while the line to Biel/Bienne was opened by the Jura bernois (JB) in mid-1874. On 17 December 1888, the Jura‚ÄìBern‚ÄìLuzern (JBL) company opened the direct line from Biel to La Chaux-de-Fonds through the Crosettes tunnel and the Renan‚ÄìLe Convers connection was closed in 1895.

She was known for her technical perfection and joy of playing. From 1927 to 1935, she sang at the Salzburg Festival as well as at the state operas of Vienna, Berlin and Munich. She was one of the impressive ranks of Austrian and German soprani leggeri who made international careers in the 1920s and 1930s, including Irma Beilke, Erna Berger, Irene Eisinger, Ria Ginster, Maria Ivog√ºn, Fritzi Jokl and Lotte Sch√∂ne.  Life  Born in Munich, Kern studied with the famous coloratura soprano Hermine Bosetti (1875‚Äì1936). The pupil followed the path and roles of her teacher - both at the opera houses of Munich and Vienna and as √Ñnnchen and Zerbinetta. She made her debut as early as 1924 at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich as Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann. There are different indications about the duration of her engagement in Munich.J√ºrgen Kesting: Die gro√üen S√§nger, volume 2, Hamburg: Hoffmann und Campe 2008, Karl-Josef Kutsch, Leo Riemens: Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon. 4th edition, volume 7. Saur, Munich 2003, , ()According to Kutsch/Riemens she went to Frankfurt in the year of her debut, 1924, see . Kesting, on the other hand, writes that she \\"moved in 1926 to the opera in Frankfurt conducted by Clemens Kraus\\". She was the first coloratura soprano to move to the St√§dtische Opernhaus in Frankfurt, where she had a contract until 1928. There, the ambitious conductor Clemens Krauss was artistic director from 1924 to 1929, and Lothar Wallerstein acted as principal conductor. The two created a new, production-oriented musical theatre in Frankfurt and took care of the musical and dramatic development of the young singer. Kern was to be regarded as a Clemens Krauss singer for many years (and she later worked at the state operas of Vienna, Berlin and Munich during his time as director). In Frankfurt she was already able to acquire numerous roles of her later very extensive role repertoire. In February 1926 she was also involved in the premiere of an opera by Bernhard Sekles. In 1927, she undertook a major South American tour.The dating of this tour is also difficult. Kutsch/Riemens write: \\"After she had undertaken a major tour of South America in 1927, she was engaged by the Vienna State Opera in 1928, of which she remained a member until 1938; afterwards she had a guest contract with the Vienna Opera between 1938 and 1933. Kesting writes: \\"After a tour of South America (1927) she went to the Vienna State Opera, where she sang until 1934\\". The Archive of the Vienna State Opera, so far complete only from 1955 onwards, records the singer's appearances from 10 March 1927 to 10 February 1943. In 1927 at least four roles in seven performances at the Vienna State Opera are guaranteed, which took place in March, May and June as well as in October and November. Since Kern made her debut in Salzburg in August 1927, taking into account the times of the ship's passage there and back as well as the necessary rehearsal times, the tour can only have taken place in January/February, if 1927 is correctly stated.  Wiener Staatsoper  On 10 March 1927, Kern made her successful debut at the Vienna State Opera and was to remain associated with the house for almost 15 years. Her first role (and her last) was Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss, which was extremely demanding both technically and artistically. Altogether she sang this part 27 times in Vienna, under the baton of such diverse conductors as Karl Alwin, Robert Heger, Josef Krips, Leopold Ludwig, Wolfgang Martin, Rudolf Moralt, Hugo Reichenberger and Franz Schalk - and three times, 1930 and 1931, under the direction of the composer himself. Also in Vienna, where she had to assert herself alongside her famous colleagues Maria Gerhart, Selma Kurz and Elisabeth Schumann, the focus of her repertoire was on Mozart, Beethoven, Strauss and Strauss. The performances of Mozart operas Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Die Zauberfl√∂te before 1945 are not yet recorded in the archives of the Vienna State Opera (as of November 2016). It can be assumed that Kern also sang Susanna, Zerlina and Papagena in Vienna as well as in ten performances of Marcelline in Fidelio, embodied 38 times Adele in Die Fledermaus, sang - besides Zerbinetta - 5 times Fiakermilli, 6 times one of the maids in Elektra and 40 times Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier. From 1928, she had her greatest success in Vienna as the maid Yvonne in 19 performances of Krenek's so-called jazz opera Jonny spielt auf, which was later banned by Nazi Germany as degenerate music, and in 1930 as Angelina in Rossini's La Cenerentola with Koloman von Pataky as her partner. She sang this role 25 times in Vienna. However, she also distinguished herself as a Verdi singer - 18 times Gilda, 16 times Oscar - and in the late romantic- veristic subject - 17 times Lucieta in Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's I quatro rusteghi and 19 times Nuri in d'Albert's Tiefland. She could also be seen and heard in the State Opera in operettas by Heuberger, Leh√°r and Mill√∂cker. Kern sang in Vienna in three premieres: 1930 in Das Veilchen von Montmartre by Emmerich K√°lm√°n at the in 1930 in Endlich allein by Franz Leh√°r at the Theater an der Wien and 1934 in Fanny in Bittner's Das Veilchen at the Vienna State Opera. This performance was conducted by Clemens Krauss, who had taken over the direction of the Staatsoper in 1929, and staged by Lothar Wallerstein, who had accompanied Krauss from Frankfurt to Vienna. However, Wallerstein had to emigrate in 1938 due to Nazi racial laws and finally continued his career at the New York Metropolitan Opera.  Salzburg Festival  On 6 August 1927 her debut at the Salzburg Festival followed, under the musical direction of Robert Heger, as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. Furthermore she took over the roles of Marzelline and Zerlina in the reprises of Fidelio and Don Giovanni. In 1929 she returned to Salzburg - as Zerlina and Sophie - and was then engaged by the Salzburg Festival until 1935. Don Giovanni was conducted by the outgoing Vienna State Opera Director Franz Schalk, the Rosenkavalier his successor and her mentor from Frankfurt, Clemens Krauss. In the following years Kern again sang Zerlina (1930), Susanna and Sophie (both 1930-35) in Salzburg, as well as Despina in Cos√¨ fan tutte for the first time (1931 to 19341931-32 and 1934-35). She also appeared there as a concert singer. Parallel to her engagements in Vienna and Salzburg, she developed a lively guest performance activity. In 1929 and 1931 she took part in two exemplary Max Reinhardt productions in Berlin: as Adele in the Fledermaus (at the Deutsches Theater) and as Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann (at the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus). In 1931 and 1933 she was a guest at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in London, where her Sophie was especially admired in the Rosenkavalier. In 1933 she took over the role of Hannerl Kr√ºger in Voices of Spring, a feature film by P√°l Fej√∂s. At the Berlin Theater des Westens in December of the same year she took part in the premiere of Eduard K√ºnneke's Singspiel Die lockende Flamme. She gave guest performances at the Milan Scala and at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, in Paris, Venice and Rio de Janeiro. She also undertook a successful tour of Egypt.  Berlin and Munich  Like Julius Patzak and Viorica Ursuleac,Ursuleac was married to Clemens Krauss. Kern followed the conductor and director Clemens Krauss first to the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin in 1935 and then to the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich in 1937. There, in her hometown, the artist achieved extraordinary popularity due to her razor-sharp coloratura, the silvery tone of her voice and the unusual brilliance of her performance. In Munich, Kern also sang her signature roles in operas by Mozart and Richard Strauss, including Sophie and Zerbinetta. The singer's involvement in NS cultural policy is not known. In July 1944, however, she gave a guest performance as Zerbinetta in Krakow in a new production of Ariadne auf Naxos ordered by Governor General Hans Frank.Siehe Fred K.

Steinmeier did want these elections to be held under Ukrainian legislation and the supervision of the OSCE. If the OSCE would judge the balloting to be free and fair, then a special self-governing status for the territories would be initiated and Ukraine would be returned control of its easternmost border.

It has grey-brown coloured and longitudinally stringy bark and angular yellow-brown to purplish brown branchlets that are lightly haired when young but later become glabrous. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The coriaceous and evergreen phyllodes have a linear shape and are straight to slightly curved with a length of and a width of . The phyllodes taper to a point and are inconspicuously multistriate with a barely discernible midnerve and eight to ten minor nerves per millimetre. It blooms between May and September producing golden flowers. Taxonomy The specific epithet is in reference to the rocky habitat in which the species is found. Distribution It is endemic to south western parts of Queensland on and around the Grey Range where it is often situated on lateritic scarps and ridge-tops growing in rocky soils as a part of savannah, heath or open woodland communities.

Vereniging Rembrandt (Rembrandt Foundation or Rembrandt Association) is a Dutch association of art patrons who raise funds to assist Dutch museums and art galleries in purchasing artworks. Since it was founded in 1883, it has helped purchase over two thousand works, including Vermeer's The Milkmaid. History The 19th century saw a major exodus of Dutch art out of the country. In 1883 the 'de Vos' drawings collection came to auction, but remained out of reach of any Dutch museum's budget. A few private individuals in Amsterdam founded the Vereniging before the auction was completed and managed to help keep a large number of major drawings from the collection in the Netherlands. Its initial aims were to fund the conservation of Dutch artworks already in the Netherlands and buying back ones from abroad, though it is no longer limited to works by Rembrandt, and other 17th century Dutch Golden Age painters. Its current aims include helping to acquire works for public collections in the Netherlands and/or supporting acquisitions by Dutch galleries and museums. Initially the Vereniging only loaned the funds, to be repaid later by the state or by the museum or gallery itself, but later donations were given to purchase works both in the Netherlands and overseas, both Dutch and non-Dutch works. After 1945 it expanded its remit from old masters to modern art and an educational aim was added in 2002. It began with 250 members, rising to 300 by 1907, 900 by 1983, over 12,650 by the end of 2015 and around 15,700 members by the end of 2018. Museums supported by the Vereniging give free entry to their permanent displays to its members.

Service in the RAF Maurice \\"Mark\\" Mounsdon started training on 24 August 1939 and joined 56 Squadron on 3 June 1940 during the Battle of Britain. Flying a Hurricane, he shared in the destruction of a Dornier Do 17 bomber on 3 July and three weeks later he probably destroyed a Junkers Ju87 \\"Stuka\\". As the battle intensified in mid-August he destroyed two Messerschmitt fighters and a probable third. He shot down or damaged about seven German aircraft before he was shot down by German fighters over Colchester on 31 August 1940. He survived but was badly burned and so spent nine months in hospitals including Black Notley and the Queen Victoria Hospital ‚Äì famous for its specialist work on burns and the Guinea Pig Club. While recovering, he served at the HQ at RAF North Weald. After the reconstructive surgery was complete, he was still rated below A1B \\"fit full flying\\" and so was posted as an instructor at RAF Bottisham and then as a flight commander at RAF Booker. When the war ended, he was posted to 8303 Disarmament Wing, searching Germany for advanced weaponry such as jets and rockets. After demobilisation in 1946, he returned to the engineering profession which he had started at the General Electric Company, specialising in inventions and patents such as ‚Äì \\"winches for use with high masts\\". Life after the war While in hospital, recovering from the burns he endured after bailing out, he married his childhood sweetheart Mary. The couple moved to the Spanish island of Menorca in the late 1970s and lived there until she died in 1993. In September 2018, for Mousdon's 100th birthday, the Red Arrows paid tribute to him with a flypast off the coast of Menorca. Mounsdon died on 6 December 2019 at the age of 101, at the nursing home where he lived on the island of Menorca.https://www.theleader.info/2019/12/09/battle-of-britain- hero-maurice-mounsden-dies/ The head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston, said that Mounsdon's bravery should never be forgotten.

Originally designed as a commerce raider,Navires et Histoire, n¬∞29, April 2005, page 83 she notably served in the Mediterranean during the tense era before the Russo-Ottoman War of 1877‚Äì1878, and took part in the Tonkin campaign and the Sino-French War.  History From 1857, the French Navy started to envision a series of swift, unarmoured commerce raiders. This arose out of two influences. One was the abolition of privateering, which deprived France of a way to interdict enemy commerce in wartime. The other was the introduction of a new generation of steam-powered frigates, such as , which brought new capabilities for long-range missions. Ch√¢teaurenault was built on an 1850 design by Mangin, similar to that of and Cosmao. Initially named Coquette, she was renamed to Ch√¢teaurenault on 18 March 1867, while still under construction, and was launched on 20 July 1868. She was part of the Northern Squadron from 1870, and took part in the blockade of Germany during the Franco-Prussian War. In January 1871, she sailed to Halifax for a mission to secure fishing activities off Newfoundland, making a port call in New York from March to April 1871. In March 1872, she sailed to Fort-de-France to serve in the Caribbean stations. On 6 November 1872, she left for Cherbourg, where she was decommissioned. Recommissioned in December 1873, she sailed to Smyrna to serve with the Levant station. In July 1875, she sailed to Toulon for a refit, before returning to the Levant station. In May 1876, Ch√¢teaurenault sailed with the 2nd Division of the Escadre d'√âvolution to Tessaloniki in the aftermath of the Salonika Incident. She then returned to Smyrna. In 1877, she returned to Lorient. Recommissioned in March 1879, she sailed to serve with the Caribbean station again. She returned to Lorient for a refit in May 1881. In June 1883, she was appointed to the Tonkin division and sailed to the Far East by way of Algiers, Port Sa√Ød and Suez, where she twice ran aground. She arrived in Singapore on 15 July 1883 to take part in the Tonkin campaign. She was part of the squadron that bombarded Vietnamese forts during the Battle of Thu·∫≠n An, and took part in the Battle of Fuzhou on August 1884 under capitaine de fr√©gate Le Pontois. After a refit in Saigon and a trip to France in 1884, she returned to the Far East and took part in the Pescadores campaign. On 24 March 1885, she took Torpilleur 45 in two and attempted to reach Ningbo, but on 28 March, a storm caused Torpilleur 45 to run aground and to become a total loss. In September 1885, Ch√¢teaurenault returned to Lorient for a refit. In 1887, she undertook a mission to secure fishing operations off Island. Ch√¢teaurenault was struck from the Navy lists on 16 May 1892. In 1895, she was renamed Onglet to serve as a hulk. She was eventually broken up in 1903.  Legacy  The overall layout of Ch√¢teaurenault have been published in Alphonse Hauser's Cours de Construction navale (1886), volume 2, illustrated page 334, figure 1676. A plan of the regulator, by √âmile Bertin, has been published in M√©morial du G√©nie maritime, figure 858. The complete plans of the ships are stored at the Service historique de la Marine. Five photographs of Ch√¢teaurenault can be seen in Navires et Histoire, n¬∞29, April 2005, pages 83 to 86.

With this goal in mind, he created his own workshop and designed dozens of patterns for hand-produced woven and printed cloth, upholstery, and other textiles. Embroidered textiles The first textile designs Morris made were created in the 1860s. and were for embroideries, expressing his interest in medieval arts and crafts, particularly the medieval wall hangings that he admired as a child. In a collection off essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893, he wrote that one of the aims of embroidery should be simply \\"The exhibition of beautiful material. Furthermore, it is not worth doing unless it is either very copious and rich, or very delicate - or both.\\" Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg His first embroidery designs were primitive, but later, working with his wife Jane, he created a set of wall hangings for his residence in the London suburbs, Red House. One of his designs in this historical style, stitched by Jane Morris, won the Morris company an award in an international competition in 1862. Morris and his workshop began making embroideries for the households of his friends as well as larger panels for some of the many new churches being constructed in England. In these designs, Morris created the decorative elements, while his friend Edward Burne-Jones drew the figures, and a team of embroiderers manufactured the work by hand. Other wall hangings were designed to be sold off the shelf of the new Morris and Company shop on Oxford Street which owned in 1877. Later, he and his daughter May made designs for panels for \\"embroider yourself\\" kits for cushion covers, fireplace screens, doorway curtains, bedcovers and other household objects. In 1885, Morris turned production of embroidery entirely over to his daughter.

His first design was jasmine trail or jasmine trellis (1868‚Äì70), based on a similar wallpaper design he had made in 1862. In the 1870s, he expanded his activity in woven furnishing textiles. IN 1877, he brought a skilled French silk weaver, Jacques Bazin, from Lyon to London, rented a studio at Great Esmond Yard, and established Bazin and his mechanical Jacquard loom there to make woven wooden fabrics. In 1881, he opened new workshops at Merton Abbey, seven miles southwest of London, for manufacturing printed and woven textiles. The workshops were next to the River Wandle, providing a source of abundant clean water, and also had a grassy meadow where dyed clothes could be dried in the open air. He produced a number of furnishing fabrics there, including the Wey and Wandle designs.

These first textiles were recreations of earlier designs he had made from the 1830s, and were printed for Morris by the workshop of Thomas Clarkson of Bannister Hall, in Lancaster. His next textile was Trellis with jasmine (1868‚Äì70). This was printed with synthetic analine dyes. Next he made Tulip and Willow, a design he made in 1873, but he was very disappointed by the result. He blamed the problem on the artificial dyes, and began doing research into the natural dyes which had been used in the 16th century. The Strawberry Thief became one of Morris's best-known designs. It depicted a scene from his own garden, where thrushes came to dine upon the ripe strawberries.

Morris and his assistant John Smith made a series of experiments with indigo and other natural dyes, but were unable to attain colours that satisfied Morris. In 1875, Morris tried working with a commercial printer, Wardle and Company, using wood blocks with a reduced number of colours and modern chemical dyes, This time he was dissatisfied with the lack of quality control by the workers, and the uneven results. He therefore decided to establish his own workshop, where he could control everything. He moved his printing workshop to Merton Abbey Mills, near the Merton Abbey Priory. For printed textiles, the design was traced onto a block of pear wood, and then the wood was sculpted so only the desired surface would touch the fabric. Thin strips of brass were pounded edge-first into the block to make the fine lines. One block was used for each colour of the final fabric, The block was inked by placing into a vat of colorant, and then carefully placed onto the fabric on the table in front of the craftsman. He pounded it with a mallet to impress the colour, then he lifted the block carefully, moved the fabric, re-inked the block, and printed the next section with the same colour. When the first colour was finished, the finished fabric was set aside to dry. If more than one colour was used, once the fabric was dry, a block with the next colour would be inked and carefully impressed over the image left by the first. The same process and the same blocks could be used for making both fabrics and wallpaper. Since fifteen or more colours might be used, It was an extremely laborious and long process, sometimes lasting several weeks, and the cost was higher than that of mechanical printing methods. File:A Wooden Pattern for Textile Printing from William Morris's Company.jpgWooden block for textile printing used by Morris Company File:Morris and Company Textile Printing Merton Abbey.jpgTextiles printed by hand at Merton Abbey (1890). Carts ran on a track behind the craftsmen, bringing them vats of fresh colours. Tapestries Morris wrote that making tapestries was 'the noblest of all the weaving arts', and most suitable for his interest in reviving medieval arts and crafts. He set up his first tapestry loom in 1877, and made completed his first tapestry, was 'Acanthus and Vine' in (1879). He wove the tapestry himself, often getting up at dawn to work on a loom in his bedroom at Kelmscott House. His design was modelled after the \\"large leaf\\" tapestries woven in France and Flanders in the 16th century, and he deliberately gave them a faded appearance to make them look two centuries old. He recorded that it took him five hundred sixteen and one half hours to complete. Once he had mastered the technique, he created a full-time tapestry workshop at the Morris and Company house on Queen Square. For most of his tapestries, Morris worked with other artists, particularly Edward Burne-Jones, who designed the figures, Philip Webb, who designed birds and animals, and with his primary assistant and successor as chief designer, John Henry Dearle. Burne-Jones made a drawing of the figures first, which was transformed into a color design by Morris or Dearle. A photographic image was made of he design with figures, to which Morris or Dearle added a floral background, and a border equally filled with designs of trees and flowers. The full scale image was transferred onto cloth by rubbing with a piece of ivory, and then woven on a loom. Large-scale tapestries were made in this way at Merton, mostly by the employment of boys ages thirteen and fourteen, who received shelter, board and a daily wage. The most famous tapestries made by Burne-Jones and Morris were Holy Grail tapestries made for William Knox D'Arcy in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall Parry (1983), pp. 116‚Äì17 Additional versions of the tapestries with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris & Co. over the next decade. In addition to full-scale tapestries, the Merton Abbey workshop produced smaller works, designed as coverings for cushions and furniture. Multiple copies were made of some popular tapestries. Ten copies were made of The Adoration between 1890 and 1907.

(Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) Carpets In March, 1875, Morris became the sole owner of what became William Morris Company, buying out the shares of his partners. He decided to diverify the products by adding carpets, a market that was almost totally dominated by original or imitation oriental carpets. Within three months, he had registered his first design for the Cataline floor cloth, a decorative covering for linoleum floors, a material which had been invented in 1855. By December had registered two designs for machine-woven carpets which he had made by the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory. As usual, Morris set a high goal for himself. His aim, he declared, was to make England independent of the Orient for the provision of hand-make carpets which aspire to the status of art. He made a careful study of techniques and materials, and made a series of experiments. When he moved to Kelmscott House in 1879 he began to produce a series of carpets called Hammersmith. He hired a labor force of young women to work on looms he set up in the former stables and garage of his London residence. He also revived the art of hand-knotting for making small carpets. In the 1880s, in addition to the Hammersmith carpets, Morris created series of designs for machine-made Axminster and Kidderminister carpets, made at the Wilton factory or at Heckmondwike Manufacturing company in Yorkshire. Many of the carpets he designed used the patterns he had invented for printed fabrics, but others, particularly the Hammersmith carpets, resembled the designs he made for his woven textiles. His early carpets sometimes borrowed popular oriental motifs. The designs he made for Axminister and Wilton carpets were less lavish in their ornament and more geometrical, to make them more affordable. In 1881 he moved the workshop to Merton Abbey, where there was space to weave much larger carpets commissioned by his clients. His designs for these large Hammersmith carpets moved farther away from the Oriental influence, and took on a more specifically English style. As with his wallpapers other textiles, his inspirations were most often flowers, plants and animals found in English gardens. One particularly notable design was the Bullerswood carpet, was made in 1889 for the wool trader John Sanderson, who had a country residence called Bullerswood in Chislehurst, Kent. Morris made two versions of the carpet for the house, in collaboration with his assistant John Henry Dearle. Extremely complex, they were virtual anthologies of all of the motifs of Morris. Morris made one carpet for the living room and another for the front hallway. He also strictly supervised the decoration of these rooms, so it would be in harmony with the carpet.

In his essay on textiles, Morris wrote: \\"The aim should be to combine clearness of form and firmness of structure with the mystery which comes of abundance and richness of detail...Do not introduce any lines or objects which cannot be explained by the structure of the pattern; it is just this logical sequence of form, this growth which looks as if, under the circumstances, it could not have been otherwise, which prevents he eye wearying of he repetition of the pattern.Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg \\"...Do not be afraid of large patterns; if properly designed they are more restful to the eye than small ones...Very small rooms, as well as very large ones, look best ornamented with large patterns.\\" \\"...As final maxims, never forget the material you are working with, and try always to use it for doing what it can do best: if you feel yourself hampered by the material in which you are working, instead of being helped by it, you have so far not learned your business, any more than a would-be poet has, who complains of the hardship of writing in measure and rhyme.\\" Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg In the same group of 1893 essays, he expressed his views of tapestry designs. He wrote: \\"As in all wall decoration, the first thing to be considered in designing of Tapestry is the force, purity and elegance of the silhouette of the objects represented, and nothing vague or indeterminate is admissible. But special excellencies can be expected from it. Depth of tone, richness of colour, and exquisite gradation of tints are easily to be obtained in Tapestry; and it also demands that crispness and abundance of beautiful detail which was the especial characteristic of fully developed Medieval Art. The style of even the best period of the Renaissance is wholly unfit for Tapestry; accordingly, we find that Tapestry retained its Gothic character longer than any other of the pictorial arts.\\" In writing about textiles, Morris emphasised the importance of using natural dyes and colours. \\"These colours in fading still remain beautiful,\\" he wrote, \\"and even after long wear, never pass into nothingness, through that stage which of livid ugliness which distinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances, even more than their short and by no means merry life.\\" Of dyeing as an Art in Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg As to colours for carpets, he wrote in his essay on textiles; \\"The soft gradations of tint to which Tapestry lends itself are unfit for Carpet-weaving; beauty and variety of colour must be obtained bh harmonious juxtaposition of tints, bounded by judiciously chosen outlines, and the pattern should lie absolutely flat on the ground. On the whole, in designing carpets the method of contrast should is the best one to employ, and blue and red, quit frankly used, with white or very light outlines on a dark ground, and black or some very dark colour on a light ground, are the main colours on which the designer should depend.\\" Textiles in Arts and Crafts Essays, by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al.

Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932. The firm was finally dissolved in 1940, but his designs continue to be produced and marketed by other textile firms, including Sanderson and Sons, part of the Walker Greenbank wallpaper and fabrics business, which now owns the. \\"Morris and Co.\\" brand name, and by the department store Liberty of London.

The 307th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 11, 2019. Plot Santa warns people about driving drunk during Christmas, and encourages everyone to enjoy the holiday responsibly. His advice is promptly ignored as the residents of South Park dangerously drive around the city while impaired. The next day, they discover alcohol sales are banned until January 2nd, upsetting the townspeople since they must endure their families while sober. Without alcohol to drink, the streets are empty and the mayor feels South Park has lost its Christmas spirit. She asks Randy (who has now grown a white beard) to resume selling marijuana to the citizens, despite the marijuana season being over. Randy and Towelie try to think of something new rather than repackaging old products. The falling snow inspires Randy to create \\"Christmas Snow\\": marijuana laced with a white substance. The people love it and resume driving under the influence. The Mayor is shocked to find that Chirstmas Snow contains cocaine since it is illegal. Surprised, Randy quickly launches a protest and easily gets cocaine legalized in several states. Santa is upset that people continue to drive under the influence, now due to drugs, and marijuana sales are subsequently banned until after the holidays. Randy decides to sell pure \\"organic, local\\" cocaine, without the marijuana \\"impurities\\". It proves popular and people continue to drive impaired. On Christmas Eve, Santa steals all the Christmas Snow from people's houses. People begin to panic as they wake up to discover their drugs are missing. Determined to save Christmas Snow, Randy chases Santa until he crashes his sleigh, and argues over the benefits of cocaine. Santa tries the drug and is impressed with the quality. Jesus arrives to settle the dispute, is convinced to try the cocaine, and is similarly won over. In order to return the Christmas Snow to South Park, Jesus levitates it into the air, causing it to snow cocaine over South Park. Everyone celebrates by consuming the drug and driving one more time. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN gave the episode a 7.5 of out 10, writing, \\"'Christmas Snow' isn't quite fresh or memorable enough to rival South Park's best holiday episodes, but it does serve as a fitting cap to Season 23. It also proves the series hasn't quite used up Tegridy Farms as a valid plot device, though it would do well to give that plot point a rest for a while.\\" Chris Longo of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, stating that the episode \\"lives up to the presents of Christmas' past.\\" Stephanie Williams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of \\"B-\\", saying that the episode presents a \\"mixture of specials previously made this season but with a dash of cocaine.\\" Dani Di Placido of Forbes thought that the Tegridy Farms joke \\"has grown as stale as a wilted marijuana plant.\\" He also criticized the legalization of cocaine in the episode, saying, \\"It's a bit of a strange joke; what's so funny about legalizing drugs? This concept simply isn't countercultural anymore, not in the slightest.\\" References External links * * \\"Christmas Snow\\". South Park Studios. December 11, 2019. * \\"Christmas Snow\\".

Alain Prochiantz served as director of the Coll√®ge de France from 2015 to 2019.  Scientific contributions  Alain Prochiantz has been working since the early 1980s in the field of molecular neurobiology, particularly on the processes of morphogenesis and nerve cell differentiation. He did his first major work at the Coll√®ge de France with Jacques Glowinski on the development and in vitro maturation of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon.Effect of striatal cells on in vitro maturation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones grown in serum-free conditions. par di Porzio U, Daguet MC, Glowinski J, Prochiantz A. dans Nature du 27 novembre 1980;288(5789):370-3.Specific stimulation of in vitro maturation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones by striatal membranes. par Prochiantz A, Daguet MC, Herbet A, Glowinski J. dans Nature du 15 octobre 1981;293(5833):570-2.Glial heterogeneity may define the three-dimensional shape of mouse mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones. par Denis-Donini S, Glowinski J, Prochiantz A. dans Nature du 16 f√©vrier 1984;307(5952):641-3. His laboratory having moved to the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, he then became interested in the molecular signals responsible for certain neuronal morphogenesis processes and, in 1991, highlighted in particular the role of homeoboxes of certain transcription factorsAntennapedia homeobox peptide regulates neural morphogenesis. par Joliot A, Pernelle C, Deagostini-Bazin H, Prochiantz A. dans PNAS 1991 Mar 1;88(5):1864-8.Antennapedia homeobox peptide enhances growth and branching of embryonic chicken motoneurons in vitro. par Bloch-Gallego E, Le Roux I, Joliot AH, Volovitch M, Henderson CE, Prochiantz A. dans Journal of Cell Biology 1993 Jan;120(2):485-92 (but also of different extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin,J1/tenascin in substrate-bound and soluble form displays contrary effects on neurite outgrowth. par Lochter A, Vaughan L, Kaplony A, Prochiantz A, Schachner M, Faissner A. dans Journal of Cell Biology 1991 Jun;113(5):1159-71. glycoaminoglycansIn vitro control of neuronal polarity by glycosaminoglycans. par Lafont F, Rouget M, Triller A, Prochiantz A, Rousselet A. dans Development 1992 Jan;114(1):17-29....) in these phenomena. As was then fully accepted in the scientific community, he proposes that cascades of regulation of homeotic genes (of the Hox family) are potentially involved in many stages of neuronal differentiation, neurite growth, neuronal polarity... However, going against a certain number of knowledge, or even dogmas in the field of molecular biology, he reports that domains of transcription factors, or even whole proteins such as Hox5, can be internalized in a cellCell internalization of the third helix of the Antennapedia homeodomain is receptor-independent. par Derossi D, Calvet S, Trembleau A, Brunissen A, Chassaing G, Prochiantz A. dans Journal of Biological Chemistry 1996 Jul 26;271(30):18188-93.Transcription factor hoxa-5 is taken up by cells in culture and conveyed to their nuclei. par Chatelin L, Volovitch M, Joliot AH, Perez F, Prochiantz A. dans Mech. Dev. 1996 Apr;55(2):111-7. and therefore suggests the possible secretion of a given transcription factor by a nerve cell A that can be internalized by a neighbouring cell B and have a biological effect on it. To clearly demonstrate this, he and his team are interested in the homeoprotein Engrailed of the Hox gene family involved in the morphogenesis of brain structures and demonstrate that it also has an intracellular location in secretion vesicles.Association of Engrailed homeoproteins with vesicles presenting caveolae-like properties. par Joliot A, Trembleau A, Raposo G, Calvet S, Volovitch M, Prochiantz A. dans Development 1997 May;124(10):1865-75. The first key publication supporting this theory was in 1998 with the in vitro demonstration that a large proportion of the nuclear transcription factor Engrailed is effectively secreted in the extracellular medium by Cos cells and recaptured by cocultured neurons acting as a potential intercellular peptide messenger.Identification of a signal sequence necessary for the unconventional secretion of Engrailed homeoprotein. par Joliot A, Maizel A, Rosenberg D, Trembleau A, Dupas S, Volovitch M, Prochiantz A. dans Current Biology 1998 Jul 16;8(15):856-63 These articles were published in good biology journals but not in the forefront because the data were relatively contested by the scientific community.Ariane Poulantzas, entretien avec Alain Prochiantz, ¬´ Les bact√©ries pensent aussi ¬ª, La Vie des id√©es, 5 juin 2009 These discoveries will take some time to be recognized.Can transcription factors function as cell-cell signalling molecules? par Prochiantz A, Joliot A. dans Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Oct;4(10):814-9.

He is a politician and a member of Nigeria‚Äôs House of Representatives from commercial hub city of Lagos. In his early career, Faleke worked in senior managerial positions with several high profile companies. He was with Aluminium Manufacturing Company of Nigeria (ALUMCO) PLC as Purchasing Manager and in early 2000, he moved his services to Crown Agents Ltd as Commercial Manager. Faleke joined active politics in 2003 after Ahmed Bola Tinibu, then governor of Lagos state appointment him first Executive Secretary of newly created Ojodu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos state. In 2011, Faleke won a vote to represent Ikeja Federal Constituency of Lagos state in the Nigeria‚Äôs Federal House of Representatives. In 2015, he ran on a joint ticket as deputy governorship candidate to Abubakar Audu in his home state of Kogi. They won majority votes cast in the keenly contested election displacing People‚Äôs Democratic Party, PDP for the first time in more than a decade with comfortable winning margin. But Abubakar Audu died shortly before the official declaration of the results. Their party, the All Progressives Congress, APC then transferred the votes to Yahaya Bello who was first runner up in the party‚Äôs primary election. Faleke challenged the decision of the party up to the Supreme Court but lost.  Early life and education  Faleke was born in Ekinrin Adde in Ijumu Local Government Area in the old Kabba Province. With the creation of Kogi State in 1991, Ijumu Local Government Area became a part of Kogi West. Faleke had his early education in Ijumu. He is an old student of Abdulazeez Atta Memorial College, Ijumu. In 1986, he finished from Kaduna Polytechnic with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Purchasing and Supply Management with an award of the best student of his class with Upper Credit. He holds Masters Degree (MBA) in Business Administration with management as the major focus from Imo State university, Owerri in 2003. He is a Fellow of chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply (CIPS), London, and Fellow, Institute of Public Administration (IPA). Between 1986 and 2003, Faleke worked in several management positions in logistics- procurement, clearing and forwarding, warehousing, distribution and construction. In 1986, during his National Youth Service, Faleke was Purchasing Expediter at National Orthopaedic Hospital, Lagos. He was Material Manager at Kayo Foods Limited, Ilupeju, Lagos before moving to Tate Industries PLC as Purchasing, Clearing, Distribution and Commercial Manager. Faleke also served as Purchasing manager at Air Liquid PLC, and Aluminium Manufacturing Company of Nigeria (ALUMCO) PLC ending his logistics and management career with Crown Agents Ltd as Commercial Manager in 2003.  Political career  Faleke political career started in 2003 with his appointment as pioneer Executive Secretary of Ojudu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State. He was in this position in interim capacity between November 2003 and April 2004, when he was elected substantive chairman of the local government. He held this office for two terms ending in 2011. In 2006, he won a vote to become Chairman of Conference 57, (the body of Local Government Chairmen) in Lagos State until 2011, when his tenure as Ojodu LCDA Chairman ended. Faleke during this period held assignments on the Lagos State Electoral Reform Committee and the Governor‚Äôs Advisory Committee of Lagos State.  Election to House of Representatives  Faleke was elected to Nigeria‚Äôs Federal House of Representatives in 2011, to represent Ikeja Federal constituency of Lagos state. He is known for his brilliant contributions to debates in the house. He was chairman of the House Committee on Anti-Corruption, National Ethics and Values, and member of house committees on Public Procurement, MDGs, Interior, Public Accounts, Science and Technology, and the House Committee on the Petroleum Subsidy Probe. = Bills Sponsored = Faleke sponsored a number of bills, including the NYSC Act Amendment Bill, which proposed life insurance coverage for NYSC members, a bill prohibiting the sale and use of military uniforms due to the attendant security risks and, still focusing on the nation‚Äôs security challenges, he sponsored another motion on the need to shut over 1,400 illegal border routes to curb insurgency.  2015 governorship election in Kogi State  Faleke was deputy governorship candidate to Abubakar Audu in the November 2015 governorship election in Kogi State. They ran on a joint ticket sponsored by All Progressives Congress, APC. Audu and Faleke campaigned for votes across the 21 local government areas of the state with populist agenda and promise to improve living standard of the people. Audu and Faleke were in comfortable lead from official results from the 21 local government areas of the state. Election victory celebration was underway when Abubakar Audu‚Äôs death was announced. Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC then declared the election inclusive. According to results declared by the Returning Officer, Emmanuel Kucha (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Agriculture, Makurdi), Abubakar Audu/James Abiodum Faleke of the All Progressives Congress scored 240,867 while Idris Wada who was the incumbent governor running for a second term on the platform of the People‚Äôs Democratic Party, PDP garnered 199,514 votes. Mr. Kucha said the margin of votes between Messrs Audu and Wada is 41,353. And that the election was inconclusive because the total number of registered voters in 91 polling units, in 18 local government areas, where election was cancelled is 49,953. That figure is higher than the 41,353 votes with which Mr. Audu is ahead of Mr. Wada.  APC transferred Audu/Faleke votes to Yahaya Bello  After the death of Audu and the declaration of the election inclusive, APC nominated Yahaya Bello who was the first runner up in the APC primary to inherit the votes received by Audu/Faleke in the general elections asking Faleke to continue in his deputy governor position. But faleke rejected the move by the APC arguing that collation of results of the election had been concluded and was awaiting official declaration of winner before the sudden death of Audu and that as the only surviving candidate on the joint ticket he should be declared governor elect. Faleke wrote INEC declaring himself \\"governor elect\\". But APC ignored his argument and went into supplementary election with Yahaya Bello as its governorship candidate. According to the supplementary election results declared by Mr. Kucha, Vice Chancellor, University of Agriculture, Makurdi, the APC garnered 6,885 votes, bringing the total votes it received to 247,752, having polled 240,857 in the November 21 election. The second runner up, the People‚Äôs Democratic Party and its candidate, Idris Wada, who was the incumbent governor, scored 5,363 in the supplementary election. Thus, PDP polled a total of 204, 877 votes, having had 199,514 at the November 21 election.  Faleke challenged decision of APC in court  Faleke went to election petition tribunal challenging the legality of the decision of the APC to make him a deputy to Yahaya Bello who was not on the ballot on 21 November when major votes in the election were cast. He told his party that he would not be available for inauguration as deputy to Governor Yahaya Bello. ‚ÄúI will not disappoint Prince Abubakar Audu. I, James Abiodun Faleke, will not be there for the swearing-in if we don‚Äôt finish the case before the Jan. 27, 2016‚Äù. ‚ÄúNobody consulted me before making me a deputy to Bello. Bello too did not consult me. I have made my position known to the party leadership on this.

He then began studying law and economics at Leipzig University until 1919, when his studies were interrupted by World War I. He joined the SPD in 1922 and worked from 1923 as a government assessor and from 1926 as a government councillor in the Saxon Interior Ministry. He was on the Dresden City Council from 1930 to 1933, when the Nazi Party seized power in Germany. He was relieved of his duties and was briefly detained. After World War II, he was appointed as Mayor of Dresden on 10 May 1945 by the Soviet city commander. There was tension between Friedrichs and the Communist Politician Kurt Fischer, which escalated in 1947 in the form of an open confrontation. This led to rumours of Fischer's involvement in Friedrichs' sudden death. A study conducted in 1999 by the government of Saxony couldn't confirm nor deny the involvement of Fischer in his death. The cause of death of Friedrichs was never clarified. He was buried at the Waldfriedhof Weisser Hirsch, then was reburied in the Municipal Heidefriedof in 1980.

He was born in Norfolk, a younger son of the eminent judge Sir Standish Hartstonge, 1st Baronet and his first wife Elizabeth Jermyn. His family moved to Ireland, where they already owned property, in the late 1660s. He entered King's Inns in 1681. His brother John Hartstonge became Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory in 1693. Through the bishop's influence, Standish was made Recorder of Kilkenny from 1694, and also served as Custos Rotulorum of County Tipperary under his father's patron the Duke of Ormond. An anonymous comic verse c.1700, namechecking various Dublin Castle courtiers of the Lord Lieutenant, suggests the ideal beau would be one who \\"like Hartstong loves\\". He died unmarried. Although his 1704 will and testament states that he was then living in Dublin and requested burial there in St. Audoen's Church, he was in fact interred by his brother in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny. He bequeathed his land at Talbot's Inch to his brother John, disinheriting their nephew Sir Standish Hartstonge, 2nd Baronet, whose impulsive teenage marriage to Anne Price of Presteigne had caused a bitter family feud.

It is exhibited at the Perkins Museum of Geology at the University of Vermont. Found at the time when knowledge of Earth's natural history was nascent, it proved key evidence for developing a glacial theory of New England. The whale skeleton was collected by Zadock Thompson and reconstructed by Albert David Hager in an unusual, anatomically-incorrect manner. Later, that error was preserved for its historical significance. It was Vermont's official state fossil from 1993 to 2014, after which it became designated as Vermont's state marine fossil.  Discovery and preservation  The restored fragment of the cranium and mandible of the Charlotte whale (white), compared to the skull of a modern beluga whale (black) The whale skeleton was uncovered in 1849, during the construction of the Rutland & Burlington Railroad. The skeleton was found buried in a farmer's field, approximately below the surface. Initially, it was mistaken for a horse skeleton and part of the whale's skull was destroyed in continued digging until a local resident, who recognized the bones as \\"unusual\\", managed to stop the digging, which allowed naturalist Zadock Thompson to collect and preserve the bones. Thompson reconstructed the skeleton and helped identify it as a beluga whale. Zadock Thompson died in 1856. Some time after, Vermont state geologist Albert David Hager bought the skeleton from Thompson's widow, to reconstruct and present it in Vermont's state natural history collection in 1861. He found the specimen to be in bad shape, and, while preparing it \\"created something that would look interesting to the public\\". There have been attempts to reconstruct it to make it anatomically-correct, but Perkins Museum of Geology curator Jeff L. Howe wrote that it was \\"more important as a historical specimen than as an anatomical specimen\\"; therefore, it has remained in the form in which Hager assembled it. The skeleton survived a flood of the museum in 1927.  Scientific significance and research  Prehistoric Champlain Sea - the whale skeleton was found in its long bay or estuary at the bottom of the map, south of Montr√©al The Charlotte whale was the first of several whale skeletons found in Vermont, a landlocked U.S. state. In 1849, the discovery provoked a controversy, because initially, scientists were unable to account for how a skeleton of a marine mammal ended up buried in sediment 150 or 200 miles () from the nearest ocean shore. Some people attributed this to Noah's flood. Swiss geologist and biologist Louis Agassiz, who had produced the theory of glaciation and ice ages a decade earlier, based on his investigation of Alpine glaciers, was in Boston at the time and theorized that the same process happened in New England. According to Howe, the Charlotte whale and the Mount Holly mammoth that had been found the previous year on the same railroad dig, were crucial evidence and motivation to research glaciation in New England. The whale skeleton was found in the sediments of the Champlain Sea, a prehistoric sea that existed from approximately 12,500 to 10,000 years earlier in the modern-day Champlain Valley that had been formed by the melting glaciers at the close of the last glacial period. At that time, the area in which the sea was located had been depressed below the sea level by the enormous weight of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. After the ice melted, the land gradually rose through isostatic rebound over the ensuing millennia. The Charlotte whale was among the earliest evidence of this process in Vermont. The skeleton is approximately long and thought to be an adult. Its gender has not been determined. Based on the sediment in which it was found, its age has been estimated at 11,000 or 11,500 years, but due to the way the skeleton was first preserved in 1849, it is impossible to use radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the skeleton.  Legacy  The Charlotte whale was designated as the Vermont state fossil on June 6, 1993. In 2014, the Mount Holly mammoth was designated as the new state fossil, while the designation of the Charlotte whale was changed to being the state marine fossil. The whale skeleton is exhibited at the Perkins Museum of Geology at the University of Vermont.

In early 1919, Hans Raj became active in the non-violent disobedience or Satyagraha movement and began to participate in protests against British rule in India. He was appointed the joint secretary of the Satyagraha organisation in Amritsar and worked to help local Indian leaders Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal, whose arrests and deportation on 10 April 1919 triggered riots. He subsequently arranged a meeting at Jallianwalla Bagh on 13 April 1919, and was present during the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre. Having survived that day, he was soon arrested but became an approver for the British, providing evidence which led to the sentencing of Kitchlew and Satyapal to two years imprisonment. Shortly after the trial, he was transferred by the British to Mesopotamia. Historians have debated whether he was an agent for the police all along or simply took the opportunity to save his own skin by testifying for the British. Early life Hans Raj was from the Katra Bagh Singh area of Amritsar. In 1911, he passed the university entrance exam. His first job was with the North Western State Railway as a ticket inspector, after which he unsuccessfully tried to join the police force and the Indian Defence Force. He subsequently took a job as a correspondence clerk for a Municipal Commissioner at Amritsar, became a banker and then a medical and stationary agent, but was frequently found to be unable to hold down employment due to his dishonesty.Wagner, Kim A. (2019) Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 50-51. Mohan, Pearay. (1920) An Imaginary Rebellion. Lahore: Khosla Bros. pp. 118-120. Both his mother and his wife were rumoured to be prostitutes, and were said to provide for him. It was also rumoured that he had close associations with the police. Political activities In 1917, Hans Raj joined the Home Rule League and was relatively quiet and unknown until early 1919, at the age of 23, when he began to participate in the protests against the Rowlatt Acts, British repressive legislation set to continue specific wartime powers for use against conspiracies and terrorist activities by revolutionaries. He became the joint secretary of the non-violent disobedience or Satygraha organisation, frequently attended their events and was aware of who had signed its pledge.Wagner, 2019, pp. 200‚Äì208. On 10 April 1919, the Indian political leaders Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal were summoned to deputy commissioner Miles Irving's home on the orders of Michael O‚ÄôDwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab. They were accompanied by Hans Raj, who waited outside with his colleague Jai Ram Singh. Satypal and Kitchlew were secretly arrested under the Defence of India Act 1915 and deported to Dharamasala, at the foot of the Himalayas, where they were kept under house arrest. The incident triggered a petition for their release and subsequent local riots, where a number of both Europeans, including the school teacher Marcella Sherwood, and Indians were injured and killed, and official buildings defaced.Wagner, 2019, pp. 74‚Äì76.Wagner, 2019, pp.186-198. Jallianwala Bagh The Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 On the evening of 12 April 1919, as a result of the deportations of Kitchlew and Satypal, in addition to the protests over the Rowlatt Acts and the exclusion of Mahatma Gandhi from entering Punjab, Hans Raj arranged a meeting to be held the next day on 13 April at Jallianwala Bagh grounds.Anand, Anita. (2019) The Patient Assassin: A true tale of massacre, revenge, and India's quest for independence. New York: Scribner. pp. 99‚Äì105. Seth Gul Mahammed, the son of a glassware merchant, helped Hans Raj organise the meeting. On 13 April, upon arrival of General Dyer and his troops, Hans Raj pleaded to those gathered to sit down. He attempted to assure the crowds that the troops would not shoot. Subsequently, 1 650 rounds of ammunition were fired over ten minutes, in what came to be known as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Dyer had ordered the troops to fire at the unarmed crowds, resulting in many wounded and \\"most were shot in the back as they tried to run away. Many were trampled in the panic\\". An eye-witness statement by a Mr Girdhari Lal, who watched the event from his window which overlooked the Bagh described \\"there was not a corner left of the garden facing the firing line where people did not die in large numbers‚Ä¶Blood was pouring in profusion‚Äù. Having survived the massacre, the following day Hans Raj, now in hiding, warned Mahammed that they were both under the threat of arrest should they be found. Mahammed later recalled that a week later, while he had been arrested and tortured, Hans Raj was being treated favourably at the police station. Amritsar Conspiracy Case Trial O'Dwyer declared martial law on 15 April 1919 and backdated it to 30 March 1919. Subsequently, trials of Amritsar conspiracy cases began on 9 June 1919 with the aim of proving that the Amritsar troubles were a pre-meditated plan by local Satyagraha leaders, later found to be untrue. Hans Raj provided the fabricated evidence and \\"carefully coached\\" statement as the prime witness, ‚ÄúProsecution Witness No. 1‚Äù. As a result of his evidence, Satyapal and Kitchlew were found guilty of conspiracy and ‚Äúwaging of war against the King‚Äù. They were convicted with 13 others and sentenced to two years imprisonment. Hans Raj's final statement had included an amended version of the account of the summoning of Satyapal and Kitchlew to Irving's house on 10 April, claiming that the two had told him to seek revenge should the summoning lead to an arrest. Despite this sequence of events being not possible, his statement formed the basis of the sentence. According to historian Kim A. Wagner, Hans Raj ‚Äúbecame integral to the effort to implicate as many of the local nationalists and Satyagraha volunteers as possible, first identifying people and subsequently coaching their confessions‚Äù. A system long established in British India, an approver such as Hans Raj was a suspect who provided a testimony which identified their associates in return for his own freedom. Where there was insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction, the testimony of an approver could be considered satisfactory. Hans Raj's house in Punjab was burned down in May 1919, before the end of the trial. Shortly after the trial, he was transferred by the British to Mesopotamia. Controversy The circumstances surrounding Hans Raj's transformation into an approver are unclear. Historians have disputed whether he had been a police agent all along. He was questioned by Jowahar Lal of the Criminal Investigation Department, whose reputation for torture and threats was well known. According to the lawyer Pearay Mohan, who wrote a book on the Punjab of 1919, titled An Imaginary Rebellion (1920), Hans Raj was a secret agent for the police all along and disclosed his testimonies without expectation of any reward. In addition, he noted that Hans Raj had attended every political meeting in the two months preceding the Amritsar troubles. Various extents of Hans Raj's involvement with police were also noted by Charles Freer Andrews, M. R. Jayakar, Madan Mohan Malaviya,Pathak, Rashmi (2007) Punjab Through the Ages. New Delhi: Sarup & Sons. p. 58. and historian V. N. Datta who wrote that Hans Raj assisted General Dyer in planning the massacre and expected the shootings on 13 April, going as far as to build a wooden platform designed to provide himself with a hiding place during the shooting.Lloyd, Nick. (2011) The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day. London: I. B. Tauris. p. 243. . However, Anita Anand's research, published in 2019, found no evidence that Hans Raj had any prior connections with the police.Anand, 2019, pp. 327 Being in the crowd on 13 April and going into hiding afterwards, according to Kim A. Wagner, suggests that there was no conspiracy and that Hans Raj was not an \\"agent provocateur\\" as some have concluded. Wagner states that Raj may not have testified for the British voluntarily. Edmund Candler described Hans Raj as a \\"pariah of fortune\\". The secretary of the local Congress Committee described him as \\"a man of no character\\". Pearay called him a \\"rudderless youth of an extremely dubious character\\".

It was probably built in the mid-18th century, and is one of the town's oldest surviving buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Description and history The Jonathon Keyes Sr. House is located in a residential setting in eastern Westford, on the east side of Frances Hill Road just north of Hunt Road. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A large brick chimney rises from the center of the roof. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the main entrance. The second- floor windows are butted against the roof eave, a common Georgian feature. The main entrance is sheltered by a projecting gable-roofed vestibule. The building's interior follows a typical central-chimney plan, with the entry vestibule that has a narrow winding stair in front of the chimney. Most of the building's styling is Federal, but construction features such as gunstock posts indicate an earlier (17th or early 18th century) construction date. For many years, local historians believed this house to be the work of Solomon Keyes (d. 1702), one of Westford's early settlers. However, its accessible construction elements show no evidence of First Period construction, suggesting it was built by one of his descendants. The building is definitely mentioned in a late 18th-century deed. It was originally built as a saltbox colonial, but its rear leanto section was raised to a full two stories, most likely in the late 18th century. The house was sold out of the Keyes family in 1898.

History The band was formed in 2014 while its members studied at Manchester University. They spent 2015 touring the local circuit while writing and recording their first EP which would follow in 2016. Bass guitarist Charlie McGough spoke of the band's formation: \\"We all knew each other from school and had played in school bands together, so to speak. After secondary school Thomas and I went off to the same Six Form and Matt went off to some music college. Thomas then spent a couple of months nagging Matt to leave this band he was playing in and come down for a jam.\\" In October 2017 the band announced that they had signed to Modern Sky UK. Hidden Horror Dance EP On 26 May 2016, The Blinders released a four song EP titled Hidden Horror Dance, recorded at Vibe Studio in Manchester. Columbia September 2018 saw the release of The Blinder's debut album Columbia. The album was produced by Gavin Monaghan (Editors, The Sherlocks, Goldblade) and was recorded in a month at his studio Magic Garden in Wolverhampton. The album is loosely based around the concept of Columbia as \\"an alternate world informed by reality\\" and follows the fictional persona of Johnny Dream on a spiritual awakening. The album is inspired by the literary touchstones of George Orwell and Jack Kerouac as well as artists such as Nick Cave, Kanye West, and The Wytches. Columbia also features the 2017 single \\"Brave New World\\", familiar from its use in a William Hill TV advert. Live At The Ritz Following the release of their debut album Columbia the band played a sold out show at The Ritz in Manchester. The band released a live recording of the set titled Live At The Ritz, released in collaboration with Blood Records. The album features three previously unheard songs taken from the band's forthcoming second album, entitled Fantasies of a Stay at Home Psychopath.

For their April 2019 UK tour The Blinders teamed up with Safe Gigs for Women, adding \\"Making our gigs a safe place is something we are deeply committed to as a band, and we urge anyone who sees anything untoward to speak out\\" Ahead of the 2019 UK general elections the trio embarked on the 'For The Many' tour, from which all proceeds have been donated to the local Labour Party. Musical style and influences The band are described as being \\"known for their energetic performances and politically driven lyrics, and in-your- face punk attitude\\". Their influences include Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, and Nick Cave. A particularly formative influence for both Charlie and Thomas came from an arena gig by Pink Floyd co-founder, Roger Waters. ‚ÄúWe watched Roger Waters do ‚ÄòThe Wall‚Äô in Wembley and that was completely life-changing, it was theatre, it was performance‚Äù said Thomas.

It is developed by Wizdish Ltd, who market it as \\"The mouse of the VR world\\". This is due to the ROVR providing omnidirectional movement in virtual reality in a manner akin to walking in the real world. This is as opposed to the current teleportation solution. The difference can be described as navigating a website with a mouse instead of cycling through links sequentially using the tab key.  Product overview  The ROVR consists of a round, concave, low friction platform and a plastic or metal frame for user support. The user slides their feet back and forward on the platform, in a reciprocating motion, to simulate locomotion whilst wearing shoe covers that are designed to reduce friction. The soles of the shoe covers are coated in ceramic discs that reduce friction between the user's feet and the ROVR. Wizdish also sells shoes with ceramic discs already fitted. A contact microphone in the ROVR's platform translates the sound of the user's feet moving into forward movement within virtual reality. A low level of noise, made by slow or small movements on the platform, becomes slow movement in virtual reality, whilst louder noises increase the speed of movement. The user moves in whichever direction the head or hand controllers are facing, as the acoustic sensor system can not detect the movement direction of the feet or the orientation of the body. The concave platform combined with reciprocating movement of the feet minimises vertical movement of a person‚Äôs centre of mass and so mimics the best low energy movement of real walking. It also encourages the user's feet to slip back into the centre of the ROVR, stopping the user from moving off the platform. A ring encircles the user at waist height, forming a containment field. This is for user support during orientation and to provide a boundary to stop the user from moving off the platform. Users quickly become used to the platform's surface, and are able to balance without the help of the ring, their hands being free to use independent controllers such as Oculus Touch, Vive wands, Knuckles and the Xbox One Controller. The ROVR works with multiple different head mounted displays as it interfaces with software directly and not through the headset.  Virtual reality sickness solution  By enabling naturally intuitive full physicality of movement in virtual reality the ROVR seeks to solve the problem of virtual reality sickness. Virtual reality sickness is a type of motion sickness that occurs when movement is seen but not felt when immersed in virtual reality thereby disrupting visual-vestibular matching and proprioception of the body. It is reported that two thirds of virtual reality users experience virtual reality sickness. The ROVR aims to satisfy the body's need to feel the movement it is experiencing visually by having the user perform a variation of walking in place. Studies indicate that walking in place increases the sense of presence when using virtual reality as the proprioceptive information in the body resembles the visual stimulus being provided by the head-mounted display. People do not carry memories of how they move their legs when they walk because locomotion is largely autonomous, being controlled by a Central pattern generator. The ROVR, therefore, doesn't rely on the exact recreation of how the legs move during ambulation, rather, it aims to provide enough activity in the legs that approximates the sensation of ambulation to 'trick' the users mind into thinking they are walking normally.  History  244x244px Wizdish Ltd was founded in 2009 by Julian Williams. Williams, an engineer for the BBC, had been experimenting with the idea of a 'VR treadmill' since 2001 and had applied for a US patent in 2003 which was granted in 2008. Williams was put in contact with Charles King, who holds a PhD in Physical metallurgy and the Science of Materials. King had links with several UK universities including University College London, King's College London, and Oxford Brookes University, the latter through a partnership that began when he was a consultant for Siemens. Together they developed and patented the low friction material used in the ROVR's platform base.  ROVR1  King and Williams built a prototype version of the ROVR and began selling it in 2012 on the Wizdish website under the name ROVR1. The ROVR1's containment frame consists of a waist high polymer ring supported by five polymer legs that adjoin a larger ring at the base of the ROVR1. This larger ring encircles the ROVR's patented, concave, low friction surface platform. Between its release in 2012 and 2016 the ROVR1, weighing in at 15kgs, had been actively tested by over 30,000 people. Sales of the ROVR1, along with funding from Liberty Global and Techstars, helped fund the development of the ROVR2. 244x244px  ROVR2  Wizdish launched their ROVR2 at the VR World Congress 2017. The ROVR2 is a slightly heavier, more aesthetic version of Wizdish's initial prototype. It weighs 25kg. The containment frame consists of a waist high, stainless steel metal ring supported by two legs that connect to the ROVR2's base. The low friction platform of the ROVR2 also has higher sides than the ROVR1. It is also collapsible, making it portable.  Applications  The ROVR's most popular application is for gaming in virtual reality. Omnidirectional treadmills increase immersion inside virtual worlds by allowing the gamer to be mobile. The gamer's feeling of 'being there' is increased by this freedom of movement as they are able to identify more closely with their in-game avatar. This is as opposed to sitting still whilst their in-game avatar moves around. There is also potential for the ROVR in the arcade gaming market. The act of sliding the feet to navigate virtual spaces provides a novel gaming experience in a similar vein to arcade dance pads. The ROVR requires the user to be on their feet and mobile and therefore can be used as fitness equipment in a manner similar to a regular treadmill and the Wii Balance Board. It also has the potential to aid with injury recovery by providing a low stress environment to exercise injured muscles. The ROVR has been used by Dominator Yachts to show customers around virtual versions of the yachts they sell. In 2014 Nissan used the ROVR to market their Juke at the Paris Motor Show. The user assumed the role of an 'iron man' figure running through a virtual city, keeping pace with a Juke driving alongside. In 2015 Wells Fargo started on a 3 year campaign using ROVRs at public events in the USA to promote the Wells Fargo brand. Mosaic, an event marketing think tank, found that after attending a Wells Fargo event 74% of the participants said they have a more positive opinion about the company, brand, product, or service being promoted. The study also found 96% of consumers who tell a friend or family member about their experience mention the company or brand running the event. With the advent of 5G the viability for wireless head- mounted displays and peripherals is increasing. Wizdish is developing a bluetooth version of the ROVR which aims to provide a wireless virtual reality experience when used in tandem with a wireless head-mounted display.

Following his conscription in 1939 he was also a soldier. He was subsequently suspected of \\"spying\\" and convicted by a military court. His death sentence was carried out using the guillotine that had been installed at the Vienna Regional Court complex, soon after the incorporation of Austria into an expanding German state. Life Walter K√§mpf was born in Vienna. He attended the D√∂blinger Gymnasium (secondary school) on the north side of the city, but left early in order to progress to the H√∂here Bundeslehr- und Versuchsanstalt f√ºr chemische Industrie, a prestigious vocational college which had been established during the early years of the twentieth century to train students for graduate-level careers in the important chemicals industry. He was excluded from the college in 1936, however, for \\"kommunistischer Bet√§tigung\\" (\\"Communist activity\\"). The circumstances under which he was readmitted are unclear, but he graduated after completion of his \\"fourth year\\" in 1938/39, receiving exceptionally high marks. In March 1938 the country was invaded and became part of Nazi Germany, which had been a one-party dictatorship since 1933. Walter K√§mpf and his friends reacted by creating the Young Communist \\"Soldiers' Soviet\\" (\\"Soldatenrat\\") group. The term \\"Soldatenrat\\" is also sometimes translated into English-language sources as Soldiers' Council: it references the workers' and soldiers' soviets/councils which emerged across much of central Europe, including Austria and Germany, in the chaotic immediate aftermath of the First World War. Other group members included Elfriede Hartmann, Friedrich Mastny and Franz Reingruber. Activities principally involved producing illegal news sheets and leaflets. As a result of K√§mpf's training in chemistry the group were also able to produce so-called \\"Brandpl√§ttchen\\" (loosely, \\"fire plates\\"), which might be used for future sabotage actions. War returned in September 1939 and Walter K√§mpf was conscripted into the wartime army. Bizarrely, Nazi Germany was now unexpectedly on the same side as the Soviet Union which invaded Poland from the east sixteen days after the German invasion from the west (which according to mainstream anglophone historiography triggered the war). For many of those, such as K√§mpf, who retained an active commitment to the illegal Communist Party, it was hardly possible to oppose unhesitatingly the alliances entered into by Stalin and the comrades in Moscow. K√§mpf's attitude to the Stalin-Hitler alliance is unclear, but any unease would have been resolved when the Germans changed sides and, in June 1941, invaded the Soviet Union. A month later, in July 1941, Walter K√§mpf switched to work as a paramedic, assigned to a military hospital for Luftwaffe casualties. His role was still essentially, a military one, however: by the time of his arrest he would have reached the rank of \\"Luftwaffenobergefreiter\\" (loosely, \\"flight sergeant\\"). It is evident that conscription in 1939 did not mark an end to Walter K√§mpf's secret double-life as a resistance activist. Membership of the army indeed presented new opportunities to infiltrate ideas into the Hitler Youth. Some fellow conscipts received anti-Nazi letters from the activists, while communist news-sheets such as \\"Soldatenrat\\" and \\"Die Rote Jugend\\" were left in quiet corners where they might be casually found and, it was hoped read by young soldiers trying to make sense of rapidly developing events. After the outbreak of war, K√§mpf teamed up with a fellow conscript called Friedrich Mastny. Mastny had also been a leader in the Vienna Young Communists. Now they worked together on the production of anti-government news sheets. The authorities became increasingly concerned by the impact on morale of anti-government activists in the army, and the resistance group to which K√§mpf and Mastny belonged was infiltrated by \\"Gestapo-spies\\" (informers. Later K√§mpf would smuggle out warnings to those comrades who remained at liberty, identifying four \\"snitches\\" named Herta, Olga, Gretl and Sonja, who lived in north-west Vienna in a house owned by a man called Glaser or Gl√§ser along the Selzergasse. One of the girls had become the girl friend of Glaser or Gl√§ser, and between them they betrayed many members of the resistance group to the authorities, along with various friends and contacts. Walter K√§mpf was arrested on 27 April 1942: Friedrich Mastny just over a couple of weeks later on 13 May 1942. He was able to smuggle out (at least) one \\"report\\" to comrades from prison, in which he warned his comrades against Gestapo spies whom he identified and who had infilterated the group. He was also able to report the interrogation to which he had been subjected, some of it under torture. On 17 February 1943 the special People's Court delivered its verdict. In the main trial he had taken the opportunity to declare that he had seen it as his duty to help put an end to the war against the Soviet Union as soon as possible. He had become convinced that Germany would never succeed in a war against Bolshevism. The defendant was an uncommonly dangerous enemy of the state. For the present and future welfare and safety of the people and of the state, his eradication was imperative. Walter K√§mpf was executed on 2 November 1943 at the Vienna Regional Court complex. His friend and comrade Friedrich Mastny was executed/murdered later the same day.

Early life and high school career Jackson grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and attended North Canyon High School, where he played defensive and offensive line on the school's football team and also was a member of the basketball and track and field teams. Jackson was rated a five- star recruit and the best collegiate prospect in Arizona as a senior and committed to play college football at the University of Southern California over offers from Washington and Arizona State. College career Jackson played in all 14 of the Trojans games as a true freshman, appearing as a reserve offensive lineman and playing special teams on the field goal unit where he played on both sides and blocked a kick against Colorado. He was named USC's starting left tackle going into his sophomore year and started all 12 of the team's games. Jackson missed part of the summer practices going into his junior season due having surgery to donate bone marrow to his sister, who suffers from Diamond‚ÄìBlackfan anemia. He returned to practice in early August and worked his way back to playing shape in time to begin the season as the Trojans starting left tackle. Jackson was named the Pac-12 Conference Offensive Lineman of the Week for Week 2 after his performance, which included blocking a 43-yard field goal attempt, in a 45‚Äì20 win over #23 Stanford on September 7, 2019. He was named first team All-Pac-12 at the end of his junior year. Following the 2019 season, Jackson announced that he would forgo his senior year and declared for the 2020 NFL Draft. Jackson played in all 39 of USC's games during his collegiate career with 25 starts. Professional career Jackson was drafted by the Miami Dolphins with the 18th pick in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft. The Dolphins previously traded defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick to the Pittsburgh Steelers to acquire the pick. Jackson made his NFL debut on September 13, 2020 in the season opener against the New England Patriots, starting at left tackle and playing all of the team's offensive snaps. Jackson was placed on injured reserve after suffering a foot injury in Week 4 against the Seattle Seahawks.

At stake were all 276 seats in the Cortes of C√°dizwhich served as a parliamentary Regency after Ferdinand VII was deposed by Napoleon. History Duuring the first years of the Spanish War of Independence (1808-1814) the popular revolts of the Spanish people were accompanied by the creation of provincial and local defense \\"Juntas\\". Those juntas assumed national sovereignty, forming their own local and regional governing bodies. These juntas aimed to defend against the French invasion and fill the power vacuum, refusing to recognize Jos√© I Bonaparte as their legitimate king. The juntas were mainly composed of military personnel, representatives of the high clergy, officials and professors. In September 1808 the local and provincial juntas ceded their power to the Supreme Central Government Junta of the Kingdom, which led the war against the French and was recognized as the legitimate government of Spain by the United Kingdom and other anti-Napoleonic countries. The Supreme Junta summoned an extraordinary meeting of the Cortes of C√°diz, a revolutionary act, since the right to call for a meeting of the Cortes was exclusive to the crown. After an intense debate in the Supreme Junta it was decided that the Cortes of C√°diz would be unicameral, elected by census suffrage (only those with a certain level of income could vote) and indirect. The Cortes met for the first time in the last major Spanish foothold during the Peninsular War, C√°diz, on the Isla de Le√≥n, on September 24, 1810.Artola, M. (ed., 2003). Las Cortes de C√°diz.

Frank La Forge dedicated a 1911 composition titled \\"Romance\\" to Durno. She was active in the Musicians Club of Women. \\"To me, a pianist lacking spontaneity is uninteresting,\\" Durno told an interviewer in 1920. \\"Therefore it is one of my especial aims, both in my own playing and in my teaching, to preserve freshness and avoid the obviously studied effort, which is unfortunately noticeable in so much piano playing.\\"  Personal life  Jeannette Durno married her manager, Dunstan Collins, in 1901. They divorced in 1910. She was a champion amateur golfer in Chicago. She died in 1963, aged 87 years, in Los Angeles, California. Her grave is with that of her pianist sister, Blanche St. John Baker, in Glendale, California.

Calzecchi\\" () is an inactive tank battalion of the Italian Army based in Ozzano dell'Emilia in Emilia Romagna. Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Friuli\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 1 August 1975 the XI Armored Battalion of the Infantry Brigade \\"Trieste\\" was renamed 11th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Calzecchi\\". The 11th Calzecchi was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the XI Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had been formed by the 4th Tank Infantry Regiment on 30 April 1941. The battalion joined 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment and was sent to Italian Libya on 14 January 1942 to fight in the Western Desert Campaign. In Libya the battalion was transferred from the 133rd regiment to the 101st Motorised Division \\"Trieste\\" on 2 April 1942. The battalion entered the front during the Battle of Bir Hakeim and continued to serve in the North African theater until it was annihilated on 2 November 1942 during the Second Battle of El Alamein. After World War II the XI Tank Battalion was reformed in Forl√¨ on 16 May 1960 as armored unit of the Infantry Brigade \\"Trieste\\". Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 11th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 33rd Tank Infantry Regiment Captain Icilio Calzecchi, who had served in the XI Tank Battalion \\"M\\" and was killed in action on 29 May 1942 during the Battle of Bir Hakeim. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Trieste\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces on 1 June 1991 the Mechanized Brigade \\"Trieste\\" was merged into the Motorized Brigade \\"Friuli\\". On 18 September 1992 the 11th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Calzecchi\\" reformed as 4th Tank Regiment. On 1 September 1993 the 4th Tank Regiment swapped its flag, name and traditions with the 33rd Tank Regiment, which at this time were assigned to the 6th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Scapuzzi\\" in Civitavecchia. After the swap the 11th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Calzecchi\\" was now the sole battalion of the 33rd Tank Regiment. As the Friuli brigade was earmarked to become Italy's only Air Assault brigade the 33rd Tank Regiment was transferred to the 132nd Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\" in 1997. In 2001 the 33rd tank regiment was disbanded and the flags of the 33rd regiment and 11th battalion were transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome.

There were four Prime Ministers during this time (Brown, Cameron, May, Johnson). However, Brown and Johnson were collectively in power for less than a year of this decade, the vast majority of the decade being under Cameron and May's premierships. There were four general elections (2010, 2015, 2017, 2019), the same number of referendums (Further Welsh devolution, voting reform, Scottish independence, Brexit) and three parties (Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats as a junior coalition partner) had been in government during this time. The decade began with the last months of an unpopular Labour government that had been in power for 13 years had oversaw the financial crisis, and a general election that resulted in the first hung parliament in 36 years. The decade ended with a Parliamentary deadlock over the issue of Brexit that ultimately led to the resignation of Theresa May as Prime Minister. Boris Johnson decided that leading a minority government was unviable, and Parliament arranged for an early general election (the first winter election since 1974), which produced the biggest Conservative majority since 1987. Notable trends during the 2010s included an increase in euroscepticism culminating in a vote by a small margin in favour of leaving the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum, a shift to the left ideologically and for the most part (with a few exceptions, most notably the 2017 general election) decline in the fortunes of the Labour Party and a rise in Scottish nationalism with the question of whether to remain within the UK or become an independent country dominating politics in Scotland throughout the decade. History by Premiership  Premiership of Gordon Brown  = 2010 general election = Polling on the winner of the UK's first national election debate in 2010. At the beginning of the decade the UK was governed by the Labour Party, which had been in power since its landslide victory in the 1997 UK general election before winning comfortable majorities in the 2001 and 2005 general elections. The prime minister was Gordon Brown, who had been in office since 2007. On 6 April 2010, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to seek the Queen's permission to dissolve Parliament on 12 April, initiating a general election on 6 May. Notable events in that campaign included the UK's first televised debates between the leaders of the main parties. In these debates the prime minister was widely considered to have been outperformed by his opponents David Cameron of the Conservative Party and especially Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats. At the election, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, resulting in the first hung parliament since 1974. Brown remained temporarily as Prime Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. There were also talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. In a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair, Blair suggested to Brown that the election had shown that British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing as Prime Minister. He concluded that he would not be able to form a government, and announced his resignation as Prime Minister. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, whose party had formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party. The latter until Ed Miliband's victory in the 2010 labour leadership contest a few months later.  Premiership of David Cameron  = Appointment = The premiership of David Cameron began on 11 May 2010 when Cameron accepted the Queen's invitation to form a government, after the resignation of Cameron's predecessor as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown. While serving as Prime Minister, Cameron also served as First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service and Leader of the Conservative Party. He headed a coalition government between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. He immediately appointed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as Deputy Prime Minister. Between them, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats controlled 363 seats in the House of Commons, with a majority of 76 seats. = Policies = Perth. Throughout his time in office, Cameron's government attempted to reduce the large deficit in government finances through austerity measures. Internationally, his government intervened militarily in the Libyan Civil War and later authorised the bombing of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and the Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome (a \\"No\\" in each case). = 2015 general election = The 2015 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday, 7 May 2015 to elect 650 members to the House of Commons. After the 2015 general election, Cameron was re-elected as Prime Minister, but this time at the head of a Conservative majority government with a parliamentary majority of 12 seats. He also became the first Prime Minister since 1900 to continue in office immediately after a term of at least four years with a larger popular vote share, and the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher to continue in office immediately after a term of at least four years with a greater number of seats. The Labour Party, led by Ed Miliband, saw a small increase in its share of the vote to 30.4%, but incurred a net loss of seats to return 232 MPs. This was its lowest seat tally since the 1987 general election. Senior Labour Shadow Cabinet members, notably Ed Balls, Douglas Alexander, and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, were defeated. The Scottish National Party, enjoying a surge in support since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, recorded a number of huge swings of over 30% (including a record-breaking swing of 39.3% achieved in Glasgow North East) from Labour, as it won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats to become the third-largest party in the Commons. The Liberal Democrats, led by outgoing Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, had their worst result since their formation in 1988, holding just eight out of their previous 57 seats, with Cabinet ministers Vince Cable, Ed Davey and Danny Alexander losing their seats. UKIP came third in terms of votes with 12.6%, but only won one seat, with party leader Nigel Farage failing to win the seat of South Thanet. The Green Party won its highest-ever share of the vote with 3.8%, and retained the Brighton Pavilion seat with an increased majority, though did not win any additional seats. Labour's Miliband (as national leader) and Murphy (as Scottish leader) both resigned, as did Clegg. They were replaced over the following months by Jeremy Corbyn, Kezia Dugdale and Tim Farron respectively. Farage said that his resignation was rejected by his party, and remained in post. = EU referendum and end of premiership = Pro-Brexit campaigners during the run up to the 2016 EU membership referendumIn a referendum held on 23 June 2016, the UK voted to withdraw from the European Union, with a result of 52% for withdrawal and 48% for remaining within the union. The following morning, Cameron announced in a televised speech outside 10 Downing Street that he intended to step down as Prime Minister following the Conservative Party conference in the autumn of that year. Cameron, who had campaigned in favour of the UK remaining in a reformed EU, said that he had informed the Queen of his decision before going to the public. He remarked that \\"fresh leadership\\" needed to come in to deliver Brexit. In the event, he officially resigned as Prime Minister sometime earlier on 13 July 2016. Premiership of Theresa May = Party election = Following Cameron's resignation various senior conservatives ran in the Conservative Party leadership election, by the end of the first stages of the contest involving rounds of conservative MPs voting on the candidates Home Secretary Theresa May's only remaining competitor was Minister of state for Energy Andrea Leadsom, who withdrew from the race on 11 July 2016. Following this announcement, Cameron said that he would step down from his post on 13 July. Cameron formally tendered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on that day, who subsequently appointed Theresa May as his successor. = 2017 general election = Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 an election had not been due until May 2020, but a call by Prime Minister Theresa May for a snap election was ratified by the necessary two- thirds vote in a 522‚Äì13 vote in the House of Commons on 19 April 2017. May said that she hoped to secure a larger majority to \\"strengthen [her] hand\\" in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. Opinion polls had consistently shown strong leads for the Conservatives over Labour. From a 21-point lead, the Conservatives' lead began to diminish in the final weeks of the campaign. In a surprising result, the Conservative Party made a net loss of 13 seats despite winning 42.4% of the vote (its highest share of the vote since 1983), whereas Labour made a net gain of 30 seats with 40.0% (its highest vote share since 2001 and the first time the party had gained seats since 1997). This was the closest result between the two major parties since February 1974 and their highest combined vote share since 1970. The Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Liberal Democrats, the third- and fourth-largest parties, both lost vote share; media coverage characterised the result as a return to two-party politics. The SNP, which had won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at the previous general election in 2015, lost 21. The Liberal Democrats made a net gain of four seats. UKIP, the third-largest party in 2015 by number of votes, saw its share of the vote reduced from 12.6% to 1.8% and lost its only seat. In Wales, Plaid Cymru gained one seat, giving it a total of four seats. The Green Party retained its sole seat, but saw its share of the vote reduced. In Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) won 10 seats, Sinn F√©in won seven, and Independent Unionist Sylvia Hermon retained her seat. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost all their seats. The Conservatives were narrowly victorious and remained in power as a minority government, having secured a confidence and supply deal with the DUP. =Issues during premiership= Anti-Brexit protestors in late 2018 May triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to leave the EU in March 2017.May triggers article 50 with warning of consequence for UK The Guardian However, under her leadership, the government was unable to reach an EU withdrawal agreement approved by the Conservative Party as a whole. How to manage the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was a major problem; the so-called 'backstop'.David Davis calls on ministers to rebel against Brexit deal The Guardian On 4 December 2018, the May government was found in contempt of Parliament; the first government to be found in contempt in history on a motion passed by MPs by 311 to 293 votes. The vote was triggered by the government failing to lay before Parliament any legal advice on the proposed withdrawal agreement on the terms of the UK's departure from the European Union, after a humble address for a return was unanimously agreed to by the House of Commons on 13 November 2018. The government then agreed to publish the full legal advice for Brexit that was given to the Prime Minister by the Attorney General during negotiations with the European Union.Theresa May, after failing to pass her Brexit withdrawal agreement through parliament three times, announced her resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 24 May 2019 amidst calls for her to be ousted. Premiership of Boris Johnson = Party election = Before the resignation, Boris Johnson had already confirmed at a business event in Manchester days earlier that he would run for Conservative Party leader if May were to do so. Johnson won all five rounds of voting by MPs, and entered the final vote by Conservative Party members as the clear favourite to be elected PM. On 23 July, he emerged victorious over his rival Jeremy Hunt with 92,153 votes, 66.4% of the total ballot, while Hunt received 46,656 votes. These results were announced an event in the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in Westminster. In his first speech as Prime Minister Johnson pledged that Britain would leave the European Union (EU) by 31 October 2019, \\"no ifs or buts\\". =Annulled prorogation attempt = On 28 August 2019, Boris Johnson announced that he had asked The Queen to prorogue parliament from a date between 9‚Äì12 September until the opening of a new session on 14 October. Parliament was in any case due to have a three-week recess for the party conference season,\\"What is prorogation and why is Boris Johnson using it?\\" . The Guardian, 28 August 2019. and Johnson's prorogation would add around four days to the parliamentary break. The 2017‚Äì19 parliamentary session was the longest since the English Civil War, while the prorogation in 2019 at Johnson's request would have been the longest prorogation since 1930. The government said that the prorogation was to allow for the government to set out a new legislative agenda. Others questioned this justification, and said that the prorogation was an improper attempt to evade parliamentary scrutiny of Johnson's Brexit plans in advance of the UK's planned departure from the European Union on 31 October 2019; opponents of prorogation included opposition MPs, UK constitutional law scholars, and Sir John Major, the former Conservative Prime Minister. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, called the decision a \\"constitutional outrage\\". Three separate cases were lodged before the courts alleging its illegality. The High Court of Justice in London found the issue to be non-justiciable, but the highest civil court in Scotland, the Court of Session sitting in Edinburgh, ruled prorogation was unlawful as it had the \\"improper purpose of stymieing Parliament\\".See A. Young, ‚ÄòProrogation, Politics and the Principle of Legality ‚Äô, U.K. Const. L. Blog (13 Sept. 2019) and E. McGaughey, ‚ÄòIs There a \\"Legal Measure\\" to Judge Parliament‚Äôs Prorogration? ‚Äô, U.K. Const. L. Blog (14 Sept. 2019) The issue was brought before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 17 September 2019 in the cases R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland. On 24 September, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the prorogation was both justiciable and unlawful, and therefore null and of no effect. Parliament resumed sitting the following day, resuming the parliamentary session. Bercow said he would ensure that the attempted prorogation would be expunged from the House of Commons Journal, the corrected formal record of parliamentary business, and replaced with a statement that Parliament was adjourned for the period of the absence.Bianca Britton, Lawmakers return to Parliament after court rules against Boris Johnson's prorogation , CNN (25 September 2019).Chris Smyth & Steven Swinford, Supreme Court ruling: This parliament is dead, says law chief Geoffrey Cox , The Times (26 September 2019). =Calls for early election= On 3 September 2019, Boris Johnson threatened to call a general election after opposition and rebel Conservative MPs successfully voted against the government to take control of the order of business with a view to preventing a no-deal exit. Despite government opposition, the bill to block a no-deal exit passed the Commons on 4 September 2019, causing Johnson to call for a general election on 15 October. However, this motion was unsuccessful as it failed to command the support of two-thirds of the House as required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA). A second attempt at a motion for an early general election failed on 9 September. =Brexit negotiations= On 2 October the Government published a fresh Brexit plan, which included proposals to replace the Irish backstop. It would create an \\"all-island regulatory zone\\", meaning that Northern Ireland would essentially stay in the European Single Market for agricultural and industrial goods, meaning that sanitary and phytosanitary controls would be needed between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The proposal also declared that Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK, would leave the Customs Union, meaning that customs controls would be needed for cross-border goods trade. The proposal did not appear to address cross- border services. On 4 October the Government assured the highest civil court in Scotland that Johnson would send a letter to the EU seeking an extension to Article 50 as required by the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. The court was originally due to release their ruling on 9 October, but decided to delay doing so until 21 October, in order to allow the court to \\"assess how circumstances have changed\\". On 17 October 2019, a revised withdrawal agreement, with a changed backstop, was agreed by the EU leaders and Boris Johnson. On 19 October, a special Saturday sitting of Parliament was held to debate the revised agreement. MPs passed an amendment by 322 votes to 306 that withheld Parliament's approval until legislation implementing the deal had been passed, and forced the Government to request a delay to Brexit until 31 January 2020. Later that evening, 10 Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson would send a letter to the EU requesting an extension, but would not sign it. EU Council President Donald Tusk subsequently confirmed receipt of the letter, which Johnson had described as \\"Parliament's letter, not my letter\\". In addition, Johnson sent a second letter expressing the view that any further delay to Brexit would be a mistake. On 22 October, the UK government brought the recently revised EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons for debate. MPs voted on the Bill itself, which was passed by 329 votes to 299, and on the timetable for debating the Bill, which was defeated by 322 votes to 308. Prior to the votes, Johnson had stated that if his timetable failed to generate the support needed to pass in parliament he would abandon attempts to get the deal approved and would seek a general election. Following the vote, however, Johnson announced that the legislation would be paused while he consulted with other EU leaders. On 28 October 2019, it was confirmed that Brexit had been delayed until 31 January 2020.Brexit: Johnson agrees to Brexit extension ‚Äì but urges election BBC News 28 October 2019 The following day, MPs backed a general election on 12 December 2019. On 30 October 2019, the day named as \\"exit day\\" in UK legislation was changed to 31 January 2020 at 11.00 p.m.The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 SI 2019 No. 1423, 30 October 2019. = 2019 general election = At the election, the Conservatives made a net gain of 48 seats, in what was regarded as a landslide victory, winning 43.6% of the vote (the highest share for any party since 1979) and 365 seats (the highest number for the party since 1987), whereas Labour made a net loss of 60 seats, losing several of its constituencies in northern England, across the Midlands and Wales to the Conservatives (often for the first time in many decades). Labour's losses in the general election led its leader Jeremy Corbyn to announce his intention to resign as the party's leader. The Liberal Democrats increased their vote share to 11.6% of the votes, though leader Jo Swinson was obliged under her party's rules to announce her resignation after losing her seat in East Dunbartonshire, leaving her party with 11 seats. The Green Party held its one-seat and saw its vote share increase. The Scottish National Party (SNP) made a net gain of 13 seats across Scotland, winning 45% of the Scottish vote and 48 of the 59 Scottish seats, while in Wales, Plaid Cymru retained its four seats with no significant change in vote share. In Northern Ireland, for the first time more Irish Nationalist MPs were elected than British Unionists, although unionist parties still won more votes; Sinn F√©in retained the same number of seats, and the DUP lost two seats, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) regained two seats, and the Alliance Party regained a seat, giving the latter two parties a restored presence in the House of Commons. = Post-election aftermath = Boris Johnson speaks in front of 10 Downing Street on the day after the 2019 UK general election. The election results had a variety of different effects and set the dynamics of UK politics going into the new decade. For the first time since the 2016 referendum it became almost certain that Brexit would take place with the process of passing the withdrawal agreement through parliament beginning before Christmas. For the Conservative Party, the election meant a shift from a fairly weak administration in the hung parliament of 2017 to 2019 to governing with a majority on a scale they had not known since the early 1990s, potentially, setting them up to remain in power for many years to come. For the Labour Party, the defeat meant an end to the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn with preparations beginning for a new leadership and deputy leadership contest in early 2020 whilst rekindling debates within the party and beyond about its tactical and ideological future. For the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson's unseating at the election also meant a fresh leadership election in the new year. Whilst, for the SNP, dominance in Scotland renewed hopes for a second Scottish independence referendum.

Background Born in 1987, Melinda F√°bi√°n first started fighting martial arts at the age of 12, starting to shotokan karate at V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës where she reached the brown belt. She then made her way to Stockholm, where, besides karate, he became acquainted with Muay Thai. She returned home in 2006 and started her favorite martial art, which she liked as a kenpo karate the Kurayfat campsite. A year later, she had already won a silver medal at the World Championships in Home Affairs as a blue belt. And in 2013, at the World Championships, also home to the podium, she was the winner of the full contact and knockdown rules, with a black belt at her waist. Melinda loves Kenpo karate so much that she runs her own club, Sakura Doyo. After finding great success at the campsite, Melinda set out on mixed martial arts, which was less well known in Hungary at the time. In this style, ground combat plays the same role as standing, so wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu are at the forefront, as evidenced in Melinda's victories. Personal life F√°bi√°n had a date and relationship with her Head Coach Ferenc \\"Rendes\\" Peszlen. Mixed martial career Early career The blonde lady first entered the cage at HFC 09 in 2015 as the only Hungarian female warrior in a quad tournament in front of a domestic audience. In the opening match, he had a straight-up victory in the first round, but she got exactly the same technique from her more experienced American opponent in the final. Nevertheless, according to Melinda, her lack of routine was the only drawback with the other fighters. In the next 3 games, she ended with one draw, one win (Ezekiel choke) and one with a split scoring defeat. The defeat was followed by a two-match winning streak (brace, ankle strain), both knocking in the first round. (Interestingly, although Melinda is basically the strength of the stand-up fight, she has achieved all her victories by forcing and has never been knocked out.) Unfortunately, after two quick wins, a defeat slipped, but that did not stop her from winning. The Hungarian girl was to get the big chance of her life from UFC and finally show herself outside the old continent. The Ultimate Fighter She has been invited to The Ultimate Fighter UFC reality show, which has not become a former champion, and often gets a UFC contract at the end of the show. And the stake in the 26th TUF season was nothing but the winner becoming the champion of the newly introduced women's weight (57kg) division. Melinda ‚Äì who even sold her car to buy a plane ticket overseas ‚Äì joined Eddie Alvarez in the selection. (Eddie Alvarez is a former lightweight champion of Bellator and UFC and is currently a UFC lightweight throne claimer.) Unfortunately, Melinda had an injury during the show, which put her mark on her training and preparation for the game. In the show, every warrior has a homemade video in which Melinda introduces Budapest, her apartment and talks about her team the Budapest Top Team. Her opponent, Rachael Ostovich, is a Hawaiian-born girl with a warrior background, with a balance of 3‚Äì3 (Melinda's 4‚Äì3‚Äì1). At the start of the match, the Hungarian girl worked well in stand-up combat but was unable to defend Rachael's grounding and gave up her back with an unfortunate move and the American took the opportunity and pulled in the back throttle after some submission attempts and some ground-and-pound and victory. With that defeat, Melinda's chances went to further the show, but the UFC gave her one more chance to prove she was in the Ultimate Fighter 26 Finale. The new Women's UFC Flyweight Champion was unveiled at this event. And her opponent was DeAnna Bennett, an American on the show. Ultimate Fighting Championship F√°bi√°n faced DeAnna Bennett on December 1, 2017 at The Ultimate Fighter: A New World Champion#The Ultimate Fighter 26 Finale. The fight ended as a majority draw and Bennett was subsequently released from the promotion. Her second fight came on June 23, 2018, at UFC Fight Night: Cerrone vs. Edwards against Ji Yeon Kim. She lost the fight via split decision. On August 11, 2018, it was reported that F√°bi√°n was released by UFC.

Passalacqua\\" () is an inactive tank battalion of the Italian Army based in Solbiate Olona in Lombardy. Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Legnano\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 30 September 1975 the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and the next day its IV Tank Battalion became the 4th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Passalacqua\\". As the war flag and traditions of the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment had been assigned to the 18th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Poggio Scanno\\" the 4th Passalacqua was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the IV Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had been formed by the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment in spring 1940 and fought as unit of the 31st Tank Infantry Regiment in the Greco-Italian war. In 1942 the IV Tank Battalion was ceded to the 133rd Tank Infantry Regiment, with which it served in the Western Desert Campaign until regiment and battalion were destroyed in the Second Battle of El Alamein. The battalion was officially declared lost on 20 November 1942. After World War II the IV Tank Battalion was reformed in 1951 as unit of the 31st Tank Regiment, which transferred the battalion on 1 July 1963 to the 3rd Bersaglieri Regiment. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 4th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment Lieutenant Ugo Passalacqua, who had served in the IV Tank Battalion \\"M\\" and died on 10 February 1941 of wounds received in battle on 27 January 1941 during the Greco-Italian war. Equipped with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks the 4th Tank Battalion joined the 3rd Mechanized Brigade \\"Goito\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and when the Goito brigade was disbanded on 1 June 1991 the 4th Tank Battalion and 18th Bersaglieri Battalion joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Legnano\\". On 27 August 1992 the 4th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Passalacqua\\" merged with the 67th Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Montelungo\\" to form the 67th Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Legnano\\".

Tulsa, Oklahoma. SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology, pp. 371-383. Physiographic setting For research purposes, the Madeira Abyssal Plain can be divided into three sub- basins. They are a southern sub-basin, which lies at a water depth of about , a central sub-basin which lies at a deeper water depth of about , and the northern sub-basin which lies at an intermediate water depth of about . The central sub-basin, which is also known as Great Meteor East after a seamount situated to the west, occupies a broad area of and is bounded by about the -contour. The central sub-basin of the Madeira Abyssal Plain is relatively flat plain that is occasionally interrupted by small abyssal hills of a few hundred meters in height and draped by pelagic and hemipelagic sediments. These abyssal hills become more numerous to the north, south and west where they form the boundaries of the central sub-basin. History of Research In 1980, the Nuclear Energy Agency's Seabed Working Group selected the Madeira Abyssal Plain as a site for the possible disposal of heat-emitting radioactive waste. Even though this concept was later abandoned, it resulted in this region being the location for intensive studies of its bathymetry, geology, oceanography, and biota. Since the 1980s, the Madeira Abyssal Plain has been studied in detail by the Ocean Drilling Program and research concerning the Moroccan Turbidite System.Schmincke, H.U., Weaver, P.P.E., Firth, J.V. and Duffield, W.A., 1995. 1.

Geology An average of of exclusively deep-sea sediments, resting upon oceanic crust, underlies the Madeira Abyssal Plain. Seismic reflection profiles across the Canary Basin and Madeira Abyssal Plain reveal north-northeast ‚Äì south-southwest ridge and trough terrain typical of oceanic crust and west-northwest ‚Äì east-southeast striking fracture zone valleys that are spaced about part. Because most of the Madeira Abyssal Plain lies within the Cretaceous Superchron, the oceanic crust underlying it cannot be precisely dated by magnetic striping. However, interpolation between recognised magnetic stripes estimated an age range of about 75 to 105 Ma for the oceanic crust underlying the central sub-basin.Searle, R.C., Schultheiss, P.J., Weaver, P.P.E., Noel, M., Kidd, R.B., Jacobs, C.L. and Huggett, Q.J., 1985.

The geology of the Madeira Abyssal Plain: further studies relevant to its suitability for radioactive waste disposal. Institute of Oceanographic Sciences Report 250. Wormley, UK. Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, 87pp Immediately overlying the oceanic crust is a layer of hemipelagic sediments. These sediments average in thickness and are expected to consist predominantly of hemipelagic clay.Searle, R.C., 1987. Regional setting and geophysical characterization of the Great Meteor East area in the Madeira Abyssal Plain. In Weaver, P.P.E., and Thomson, J. (Eds.), Geology and Geochemistry of Abyssal Plains. Special Publication of the Geological Society of London, 31:49-70. Overlying the hemipelagic sediments, are alternating turbidites and thin beds of pelagic sediment. These sediments initially in filled irregularities on the uneven surface of the heimipelagic sediments to produce a flat plain that later turbidites accumulated. The total thickness of turbidites that have accumulated averages in thickness. In a few deep troughs within the oceanic crust, the total thickness of turbidites may reach . In seismic reflection, the sequnce of turbidites varies from being strongly acoustically laminated near the top to poorly stratified to transparent near the base. An individual turbidite often consists of of sediment spread across the entire Madeira Abyssal Plain. It is typically fine-grained, except in the proximal parts of the plain. The deposition of a typical turbidite causes little or no erosion of the underlying bed. A thin bed of fine-grained, pelagic sediment typically separates successive turbidites.Rothwell, R.G., Pearce, T.J., and Weaver, P.P.E., 1992. Late Quaternary evolution of the Madeira Abyssal Plain, Canary Basin, NE Atlantic. Basin Research, 4:103-131.Weaver, P.P.E., Searle, R.C., and Kuijpers, A., 1986. Turbidite deposition and the origin of the Madeira Abyssal Plain. In Summerhayes, C.P., and Shackleton, N.J. (Eds.), North Atlantic Palaeoceanography. Special Publication of the Geological Society of London, 21:131-143. Based upon composition, the turbidites have been divided into three groups. First, there are a group of organic-rich turbidites. These turbidites represent organic-rich sediments that turbidity currents transported from two sources, one north and one south of the Canary Islands. These turbidites are typically bicolored turbidite units. Their base is usually olive green where the organic material remains below surface oxidation and their upper part is pale green where the organic material has been oxidized. Second, there are volcanic turbidites composed largely of sediment derived from either volcanic seamounts or islands. These turbidites represent the distal sediments of turbidity currents generated by massive submarine landslides resulting from the collapse of the flanks of volcanic seamounts or islands within either the Canary islands or Madeira Archipelago. Finally, there are calcareous turbidites derived from submarine landslides effecting one of the Seewarte Seamounts to the west of the Madeira Abyssal Plain. Thin pelagic layers separated individual turbidites. As determined by microfossils, each individual layer often represents several tens of thousands of years of pelagic sedimentation in a deep sea, abyssal environment. Depending on the carbonate compensation depth at the time of deposition, these layers consist either of calcareous ooze, marls, or clay. During the last 2.6 million years within the region of the Madeira Abyssal Plain, carbonate compensation depth has been closely controlled by the general circulation of ocean currents and has oscillated in phase with climatic shifts. During interglacial periods, the carbonate compensation depth was quite deep. This allowed for the preservation of calcareous microfossils, e.g. foraminifera and coccoliths, in the Madeira Abyssal Plain and the formation of calcareous ooze. Conversely, during glacial periods, and prior to 2.6 million years ago, the carbonate compensation depth was shallower. This lead either to poor preservation of calcareous microfossils and frequently no preservation of them at all and, respectively, the accumulation of either marl or clay to form pelagic layers.

Early life and high school career Ford was a chess prodigy, learning the game at the age of four with his father, Cuzear, serving as his teacher. He began beating adults before winning two California state titles and was ranked seventh in the nation in his age bracket. However, he quit playing competitively at the age of eight to focus on basketball. Ford attended Folsom High School, playing under coach Mike Wall. He scored 34 points in a playoff game against Sacramento High School in March 2016. Ford was named the Sacramento Bee‚Äôs player of the year two times. He committed to play for Saint Mary's because he liked the structured offense, spurning offers from Gonzaga, California, Oregon and Oregon State. College career As a freshman, Ford considered redshirting, but ultimately came off the bench as a backup to Joe Rahon, who encouraged him to focus on his defense. In the summer of 2017, Ford was diagnosed with epiglottitis and ended up in the hospital, losing the 12 pounds he gained lifting weights. He scored 27 against BYU in the West Coast Conference tournament. Ford had 19 points against Southeastern Louisiana in the first round of the NIT and made a SportsCenter top 10 play when he took a pass from Emmett Naar and did a double-spin move to complete a layup off the glass. As a sophomore, Ford averaged 11.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game, shooting 50.8 percent from the field and 44.3 percent from behind the arc. Ford scored a career-high 35 points on 11-of-17 shooting in a 92-63 win over Utah Valley on November 13, 2018. As a junior, Ford was second in the WCC in scoring with 21.1 points per game to go with 2.5 assists, 2.8 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game. He helped lead the Gaels to an upset on Gonzaga in the conference championship and NCAA Tournament appearance, where they fell to Villanova. He was named to the First Team All-WCC. Coming into his senior season, Ford was named to the Naismith and Wooden Award watchlists. In his senior season opener, he scored 26 points and hit 4-of-8 three-pointers as Saint Mary's defeated Wisconsin 65-63 in overtime. At the conclusion of the regular season, Ford was named to the First Team All-WCC. On March 7, 2020, Ford scored a career-high 42 points in a 89-82 double overtime win over Pepperdine in the WCC Tournament quarterfinal. He scored 18 points in the WCC Tournament semifinal versus BYU and hit a jump shot with 1.4 seconds remaining to give the Gaels a 51-50 win.

E. Thrane who owned a property at the site. The name of the street was in 1885 changed to Sj√¶llandsgade. City engineer Charles Ambt created a masterplan for redevelopment of the area east of Prinsesse Charlottes Gade in 1899. Sj√¶llandsgade was then over the next decade in stages extended to Tagensvej. Notable buildings No. 12: Guldberg School Sj√¶llandsgade School is from 1887 and was designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm. The school was in 1921 extended by city architect Hans Wright. Sj√¶llandsgade School was in 2006 merged with Stevnsgade School under the name Guldberg School. Simeon's Church (No. 12B) is a Church of Denmark parish church. It was constructed in 1913-14 to designs by Johannes Magdahl Nielsen. No. 12A: Sj√¶llandsgade Public Baths Sj√¶llandsgade Public Baths (No. 12 A) is attached to the church. It opened in 1917 as one of several new public bath houses in the city but closed when private bathrooms had become common later in the century. The Baroque Revival style building by city architect Hans Wright was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 2013. The bath house was shortly thereafter reopened by a group of volunteers. No. 16-21 The section from Guldbergsgade to Tagensvej follows the northwestern boundary of De Gamles By. Copenhagen Health and Care Services (Sundheds- og Omsorgsforvaltningen) is based at No. 40. The buildings on the other side of the street are mainly apartment blocks from the 1920s. The apartment block at No. 9-13 was built for ABB to designs by Johannes Str√∏m Tejsen in 1917-18. The block at No. 15 is from 1918‚Äì19 and was designed by Christian Mandrup-Poulsen. No. 17-21 is from 1921 and was designed by Einar Ambt and Axel Preisler. Public art In front of Copenhagen Health and Care Services' building at No. 40 stands a granite sculpture, Guldskat (Treasure of Gold), created by Ejgil Westergaard and installed at the site in 1990.

He received criticism from the people around him for having an unknown disease for most of his life. It was not until his later years that he received notoriety and was given multiple treatments for his condition.  Early years  Dede Koswara was healthy from birth up to his early childhood. At the age of ten, he started to develop warts around his injured knee, which then grew onto his limbs and face. He was unable to afford treatment for the disease and had initially tried to remove one of the larger warts, however the wart eventually regrew. He attempted to live a normal life, working as a craftsman, he married at the age of 18 and had two children. The warts continued to grow uncontrollably, which eventually limited his movements and became dependent on others for daily routines. Having become too dependent, he lost his job, was divorced by his wife, and was separated from his children. His parents offered him to live with them, so as to provide help. He was later hired by a carnival owner to be a part of a traveling freak show.  Later years  In November 2007, a video about Dede Koswara appeared on the Internet. His story was shared on the Discovery Channel and TLC series My Shocking Stories (Extraordinary People) in the episode \\"Half Man Half Tree\\". In August 2008, an episode of ABC's Medical Mysteries, titled \\"Tree Man\\", was released, which was dedicated to Koswara's story. In August 2008, he underwent nine operations and had 95% of warts, about 6 kg (13 lb), surgically removed. During this time, his health had significantly improved so much that he regained the use of his hands and feet. However, the warts started to regrow and was informed that two surgeries a year was necessary to keep the infections down. Dede Koswara died on 30 January 2016, aged 44, at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from a series of health problems relating to his condition.

She has composed many works based on American history, including Harriet Tubman: When I Crossed That Line to Freedom, Invitation to a Die-In and \\"The Journey of Phillis Wheatley\\".  Biography  Nkeiru Okoye was born on July 18, 1972 and grew up in New York. Her mother is African American and her father was Nigerian, a member of the Igbo ethnic group.https://www.nkeiruokoye.com/faq During her childhood, she spent time in both the United States and Nigeria. Okoye learned to play piano at age 8 and began writing music at age 13. Okoye went to the Preparatory Division of the Manhattan School of Music. When her parents separated, Okoye and her older sister lived with their mother on Long Island. She attended Oberlin Conservatory of Music for her undergraduate work, graduating in 1993. She then went on to Rutgers University to study with her mentor, Noel Da Costa. For a premiere at Rutgers in 1999, she conducted her composition, \\"The Creation\\", with Danny Glover narrating key parts of the work.  Work  Okoye penned her best known \\"Voices Shouting Out\\" in 2002. It was commissioned by Maestro Wes Kenney and the Virginia Symphony Orchestra. In 2005, Okoye collaborated with Carolivia Herron to write a narrated work for orchestra based on the life of Phillis Wheatley called \\"The Journey of Phillis Wheatley\\". Okoye used some Ghanaian influence in the work. In 2014, Okoye's Harriet Tubman: When I Crossed That Line to Freedom was premiered by American Opera Projects. The opera looks at the life of enslaved Africans living in plantations in the South, Harriet Tubman and the music of the time period. Okoye received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to help her complete the work. Her opera not only highlights the life of Tubman, but also of others such as William Still and Samuel Green. Okoye said about choosing Tubman as a subject: \\"I wanted to write an opera about a woman who did great things and survived.\\" The opera includes her 2006 stand-alone song cycle, \\"Songs of Harriet Tubman\\". Her work, Invitation to a Die-In (2017) was commissioned and premiered by conductor Ng Tian Hui and the Mount Holyoke Symphony Orchestra.

The text for Invitation was written by David Cote and the performance of the work includes percussion imitating gunshots and members of the orchestra falling over as if they had been hit. For the 250th anniversary of the founding of Charlotte, North Carolina, the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra commissioned Okoye to write an orchestral work to commemorate the city's history. The piece, reflecting the diversity of the history of the city, is 12 minutes long and called \\"Charlotte Mecklenburg.\\" \\"Charlotte Mecklenburg\\" also holds a reference to a victim of police violence, with the percussion section of the work referencing Keith Lamont Scott.

Di Dio\\" () is an inactive tank battalion of the Italian Army based in Vivaro in Friuli Venezia Giulia. Originally the battalion, like all Italian tank units, was part of the infantry, but since 1 June 1999 it is part of the cavalry. Operationally the battalion was last assigned to the 8th Mechanized Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\".  History  The battalion was formed during the 1975 army reform: on 31 October 1975 the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment was disbanded and the next day its VII Tank Battalion became the 7th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Di Dio\\". As the war flag and traditions of the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment were assigned to the 3rd Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Cernaia\\" the 7th Di Dio was granted a new war flag on 12 November 1976 by decree 846 of the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone. The battalion received the traditions of the VII Tank Battalion \\"M\\", which had been formed by the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment on 30 January 1941. The battalion was sent to Italian Libya on 15 February 1941 to bolster Italian forces after the successful British Operation Compass. Initially the regiment served with the 32nd Tank Infantry Regiment, and from 1 September 1941 with the newly formed 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment. With the 132nd the battalion was heavily decimated during the British Operation Crusader, fighting battles at Bir el Gubi on 19 November and 4-7 December and for Point 175 before retreating West. The VII Tank Battalion was disbanded at the end of January 1942 to bring regiment's two remaining battalions back up to strength. For its service 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment was awarded a Gold Medal of Military Valour, which during the 1975 army reform passed with the 132nd regiment's flag to the 8th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Secchiaroli\\" and was duplicated for the new flag of the 7th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Di Dio\\". After World War II the VII Tank Battalion was reformed in Aviano on 5 January 1959 as unit of the 132nd Tank Regiment, which transferred the battalion on 1 August 1963 to the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment. Tank and armored battalions created during the 1975 army reform were all named for officers, soldiers and partisans, who were posthumously awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for heroism during World War II. The 7th Tank Battalion's name commemorated 1st Tank Infantry Regiment Lieutenant Alfredo Di Dio, who, together with his brother Antonio Di Dio, formed one of the first partisan units in Piedmont after the German occupation of Italy in September 1943. Having already lost his brother on 13 February 1944 in a firefight with German forces, Alfredo Di Dio was killed in action on 12 October 1944. Equipped with M60A1 Patton main battle tanks the battalion joined the 8th Mechanized Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\", whose headquarters had been formed from the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment's headquarters. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army reorganized its forces and on 1 July 1991 the Garibaldi brigade's headquarters moved to Caserta in the South of Italy. In expectation of the move the 7th Tank Battalion was disbanded a month earlier on 31 May 1991 and its flag transferred to the Shire of the Flags at the Vittoriano in Rome.

After winning his only start as a juvenile in 2017 he showed good form in the following year when he won three races and finished third in the Mainichi Hai. He emerged as a top-class performer in 2019 winning the Tokyo Shimbun Hai in February and going to take both of Japan's open age Grade 1 mile races, the Yasuda Kinen and the Mile Championship Background Indy Champ is a dark bay horse with a white star and stripe bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During his racing career he was trained by Hidetaka Otonashi and raced in the blue and red colours of the Northern Farm affiliate Silk Racing. He was from the twelfth crop of foals sired by Stay Gold a horse whose wins included the Dubai Sheema Classic and Hong Kong Vase in 2001. He went on to sire many major winners including Orfevre, Gold Ship, Nakayama Festa, Rainbow Line and Fenomeno. Indy Champ's dam Will Power who won four minor races in five seasons on the track between 2009 and 2013 was a half-sister to several winners including Real Impact (Yasuda Kinen, George Ryder Stakes) and Neorealism (Queen Elizabeth II Cup). Racing career 2017: two-year-old season On 28 December 2017 at Hanshin Racecourse Indy Champ made his racecourse debut in a 1400-metre event for previously unraced juveniles and won narrowly from Amore Jody and twelve others. 2018: three-year-old season Indy Champ made a successful start to his second season when he won a minor race over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 13 January. He was then stepped up in class and distance for the Grade 3 Mainichi Hai over 1800 metres at Hanshin in March when he started at odds of 3.1/1 and finished third of the ten runners, two and a quarter lengths behind the winner Blast Onepiece. In April at the same track he was beaten just over a length when he came home fourth behind Tower of London in the Grade 3 Arlington Cup. Indy Champ was dropped back in class in June and finished second to the filly A Shin Twinkle in a minor race over 1600 metres at Hanshin. At Chukyo Racecourse on 14 July he started favourite for a race over 1600 metres and won from the four-year-old Clear The Track. After a break of more than five months Indy Champ returned to the track on 16 December and won the Motomachi Stakes over 1600 metres at Hanshin. 2019: four-year-old season Indy Champ's trainer Hidetaka Otonashi On his first run as a four-year-old Indy Champ started the 1.7/1 in a fifteen-runner field for the Grade 3 Tokyo Shimbun Hai over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 3 February. Ridden by Yuichi Fukunaga he raced on the inside rail and turned into the straight in sixth place before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish. He opened up a clear advantage before holding off the late challenges of Red Olga and Satono Ares to win by half a length and a head. On his next appearance he came home fourth behind Danon Premium in the Yomiuri Milers Cup at Kyoto on 21 April after he failed to settle in a slowly-run race. In the 69th edition on the Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres over 1600 metres at Tokyo on 2 June Indy Champ was partnered by Fukunaga and went off at odds of 18.2/1 in a sixteen-runner field. Almond Eye started the odds-on favourite while the other contenders included Danon Premium, Aerolithe (Mainichi Okan), Persian Knight (2017 Mile Championship), Mozu Ascot (winner of the race in 2018), Keiai Nautique (NHK Mile Cup) and Stelvio (2018 Mile Championship). After racing in fifth place as Aerolithe set the pace Indy Champ threaded his way through the field in the straight, took the lead in the final strides and won by a neck, with the fast-finishing Almond Eye a nose away in third. Fukunaga commented \\"He was tuned up well, was in great shape, and had a good draw, so I just tried hard not to miss our break. He tends to get distracted when he's up front so I kept him off the pace. We were up against fierce competition, but I believed that he had a good chance as long as I didn‚Äôt make any mistakes and he certainly responded beautifully to our expectations\\". After a break of four months Indy Champ returned in the Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 6 October in which he raced in second place for most of the way before finishing third behind Danon Kingly and Aerolithe. On 17 November he was one of seventeen horses to contest the 36th running of the Mile Championship at Kyoto and with Kenichi Ikezoe in the saddle he started the 5.4/1 third choice in the betting behind Danon Premium and Danon Kingly.The other runners included Al Ain, Mozu Ascot, Red Olga, Persian Knight and Diatonic (Swan Stakes). Ikezoe tucked Indy Champ in behind the leaders in fourth place on the inside before making a forward move exiting the final turn. He went to the front 150 metres from the finish, broke clear of his rivals and won by one and a half lengths from Danon Premium. Ikezoe, who took the ride at short notice when Fukunaga was suspended, said \\"I was told that he is a bit unstable at the start but he broke well and we were able to race in good position while eyeing Danon Premium. He responded really well when asked at the lane\\". For his final run of the year Indy Champ was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse to contest the Hong Kong Mile on 8 December and started joint-favourite alongside the local champion Beauty Generation. Ridden by Damian Lane he struggled to obtain a clear run in the last 400 metres and although he kept on well he was unable to reach the leaders and came home seventh of the ten runners behind Admire Mars. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Indy Champ was voted Best Sprinter or Miler taking 211 of the 274 votes. He also finished second to Win Bright in the poll to determine Best Older Male Horse, receiving 118 votes to the winner's 136.

Silas spent the majority of the American Revolution on the frontier fighting against the Indians, however, near the end of his life, he served under George Rogers Clark through the Illinois Campaigns of 1779 and died at the Battle of Blue Licks on August 19, 1782 fighting a mixed band of Natives, Loyalists and British troops. Following his death, Silas' fianc√©, Sarah Caldwell, married his brother James and was the grandmother of U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan. Harlan County, Kentucky is named in honor of Silas Harlan. Kentucky Settlement Silas and his brother, James, accompanied James Harrod in founding Harrodstown, the oldest permanent white settlement in Kentucky, in May 1774 and is listed as a town resident in a census between December 1777 and October 1778, along with Squire Boone, younger brother to famous pioneer Daniel Boone. As a member of the Committee for the Defense of West Fincastle in 1776, Silas supported making Kentucky a county of Virginia rather than an independent state under the Transylvania Company, as did George Rogers Clark. In 1778, Silas, with the help of his uncle, Jacob, and his brother, James, founded \\"Harlan's Station\\", a log stockade on the Salt River near Danville, about seven miles above Harrodsburg. Revolutionary War While serving with the Kentucky militia, he was a scout and hunter and ultimately received the rank of major. January 2, 1777 at Harrodsburg, Silas Harlan was one of about thirty men raised by James Harrod to retrieve five hundred pounds of gunpowder from Three Islands in present-day Lewis County. George Rogers Clark and John Gabriel Jones had acquired and delivered this powder from Fort Pitt (present Pittsburgh) the preceding August for the Kentucky settlers and Colonel John Todd had attempted to retrieve the powder December 25, 1776, but failed, leaving Harrod to the task the following week. Harrod's company, which also included David Glenn, Isaac Hite and Simon Kenton among Harlan, then secured the powder and returned to Harrodsburg. He commanded a company of scouts under General George Rogers Clark in the Illinois Campaigns of 1779, and proved himself a most active, energetic and efficient officer. Silas was also Captain of a company in John Bowman's raid on Old Chillicothe in 1779, and assisted Clark in establishing Fort Jefferson at the mouth of the Ohio River in 1780. Major Silas Harlan died on August 19, 1782, leading the advance party at the Battle of Blue Licks, one of the last battles of the American Revolution and the last victory for the Loyalists and Native Americans during the frontier war. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries. General Clark, who was an older brother of the more famed William Clark, said of Silas: \\"he was one of the bravest and most accomplished soldiers that ever fought by my side.\\" In Ref. 10, Silas Harlan is entry #215.

The number of people denying climate change is increasing, contrary to the increasing volume of scientific evidence and the consensus of scientists that anthropogenic climate change is occurring. Several psychological barriers have been proposed to account for this phenomenon.  Psychological barriers  Various psychological factors can impact the effectiveness of communication about climate change, driving potential climate change denial.  Distance in time, space, and influence  Climate change is often portrayed as occurring in the future, whether that be the near or distant future. Many estimations portray climate change effects as occurring by 2050 or 2100, which both seem much more distant in time than they really are, which can create a barrier to acceptance. There is also a barrier created by the distance portrayed in climate change discussions. Effects caused by climate change across the planet do not seem concrete to people living thousands of miles away, especially if they are not experiencing any effects. Climate change is also a complex, abstract concept to many, which can create barriers to understanding. Carbon dioxide is an invisible gas, and it causes changes in overall average global temperatures, both of which are difficult, if not impossible, for one single person to discern. Due to these distances in time, space, and influence, climate change becomes a far-away, abstract issue that does not demand immediate attention.  Framing  In popular climate discourse framing, the three dominant framing ideas have been apocalypse, uncertainty and high costs/losses. These framings create intense feelings of fear and doom and helplessness. Framing climate change in these ways creates thoughts that nothing can be done to change the trajectory, that any solution will be too expensive and do too little, or that it is not worth trying to find a solution to something we are unsure is happening. Climate change has been framed this way for years, and so these messages are instilled in peoples‚Äô minds, elicited whenever the words ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù are brought up.  Dissonance and denial  Because there is little solid action that people can take on a daily basis to combat climate change, then some believe climate change must not be as pressing an issue as it is made out to be. An example of this phenomenon is that most people know smoking cigarettes is not healthy, yet people continue to smoke cigarettes, and so an inner discomfort is elicited by the contradiction in ‚Äòthinking‚Äô and ‚Äòdoing‚Äô. A similar cognitive dissonance is created when people know that things like driving, flying, and eating meat are causing climate change, but the infrastructure is not in place to change those behaviors effectively. In order to address this dissonance, climate change is rejected or downplayed. This dissonance also fuels denial, wherein people cannot find a solution to an anxiety-inducing problem, and so the problem is denied outright. Creating stories that climate change is actually caused by something out of humans‚Äô control, such as sunspots or natural weather patterns, or suggesting that we must wait until we are certain of all of the facts about climate change before any action be taken, are manifestations of this fear and consequent denial of climate change. > \\"It seems as if people stop paying attention to global climate change when > they realize that there are no easy solutions for it. Many people instead > judge as serious only those problems for which they think action can be > found.‚Äù Individuals are alarmed about the dangerous potential futures resulting from a high-energy world in which climate change was occurring, but simultaneously create denial mechanisms to overcome the dissonance of knowing these futures, yet not wanting to change their convenient, comfortable lifestyles. These denial mechanisms include things like overestimating the costs of changing their lifestyles, blaming others, including government, rather than their own inaction, and emphasizing the doubt that individual action could make a difference within a problem so large.  Cultural identity and political worldview  Climate messages are filtered through cultural identity. In the United States, climate change acceptance or denial is largely based on political affiliation. This is partially caused by the idea that Democrats focus more on tighter government regulations and taxation, which are the basis for most environmental policy. Political affiliation also affects how different people interpret the same facts. The more highly educated an individual is, the more likely they are to rely on their own interpretation and political ideology rather than rely on scientists‚Äô opinions. Therefore, political worldviews override expert opinion on the interpretation of climate facts and evidence of anthropogenic climate change. Another reason for the discrepancy in climate change denial between liberals and conservatives is the idea that ‚Äúcontemporary environmental discourse is based largely on moral concerns related to harm and care, which are more deeply held by liberals than by conservatives,‚Äù whereas if the discourse were framed using moral concerns related to purity that are more deeply held by conservatives, the discrepancy was resolved. Affiliation with a political group, especially in the United States, is a very important personal and social identity for many. Because of this, it is likely that an individual will carry the popular values of their political affiliation, regardless of their personal belief on the matter, solely so they are not ostracized from the group and their identity. A study of climate change denial indicators from public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010 shows that conservative white males in the United States are significantly more likely to deny climate change than other Americans. Furthermore, conservative white males who reported understanding climate change very well were even more likely to deny climate change. This is further proven through another study done in Australia, that showed that when participants had their political identity made salient, through definition and characteristics of supporters, were more likely to deny climate change and reject governmental climate change policies, especially when those participants were aligned with right-wing politics. One telltale worldview that leads to climate change denial is the belief in free enterprise capitalism. The ‚Äúfreedom of the commons‚Äù, or the freedom to use natural resources as a public good as it is practiced in free enterprise capitalism destroys important ecosystems and their functions, and so having a stake in this worldview does not correlate with climate change mitigation behaviors. Political worldview plays an important role in environmental policy and action (or inaction). Liberals tend to focus on environmental risks, while conservatives focus on the benefits that economic development brings. Because of these differences in worldviews, with one political ideology focusing on risks while the other focuses on benefits, conflicting opinions on the acceptance or denial of climate change arise.  Limited cognition  Limited cognition of the human brain, caused by things like the fact that the human brain has not evolved much in thousands of years, and so has not transitioned to caring about the future rather than immediate danger, ignorance, the idea that environments are composed of more elements than humans can monitor, so we only attend to things causing immediate difficulty, which climate change does not seem to do, uncertainty, undervaluing of distant or future risk, optimism bias, and the belief that an individual can do nothing against climate change are all cognitive barriers to climate change acceptance.  Ideologies  Ideologies, including suprahuman powers, technosalvation, and system justification, are all psychological barriers to climate change acceptance. Suprahuman powers describes the belief that humans cannot or should not interfere because they believe a religious deity will not turn on them or will do what it wants to do regardless of their intervention. Technosalvation is the ideology that technologies such as geoengineering will save us from climate change, and so mitigation behavior is not necessary. Another ideological barrier is the ideology of system justification, or the defense and justification of the status quo, so as to not ‚Äúrock the boat‚Äù on a comfortable lifestyle.  Comparison with others  Social comparisons between individuals build social norms. These social norms then dictate how someone ‚Äúshould‚Äù behave in order to align with society‚Äôs ideas of ‚Äúproper‚Äù behavior. This barrier also includes perceived inequity, where an individual feels they should not or do not have to act a certain way because they believe no one else acts that way.  Sunk costs  Financial investment in fossil fuels and other climate change inducing industries is often a reason for denial of climate change. If you accept that these things cause climate change, you would have to lose your investment, and so continued denial is more acceptable. People are also very invested in their behavior. Behavioral momentum, or daily habits, are one of the most important barriers to remove for climate change mitigation. Lastly, conflicting values, goals, and aspirations can interfere with the acceptance of climate change mitigation. Because many of the goals held by individuals directly conflict with climate change mitigation strategies, climate change gets pushed to the bottom of their list of values, so as to minimize the extent of its conflict.  Views of others and perceived risk  If someone is held in a negative light, it is not likely others will take guidance from them due to feelings of mistrust, inadequacy, denial of their beliefs, and reactance against statements they believe threaten their freedom. Several types of perceived risk can occur when an individual is considering changing their behavior to accept and mitigate climate change: functional risk, physical risk, financial risk, social risk, psychological risk, and temporal risk. Due to the perception of all of these risks, the individual may just reject climate change altogether to avoid potential risks completely.  Limited behavior  One type of limited behavior is tokenism, where after completing one small task or engaging in one small behavior, the individual feels they have done their part to mitigate climate change, when in reality they could be doing much more. Individuals could also experience the rebound effect, where one positive activity is diminished or erased by a subsequent activity (like walking to work all week because you are flying across the country every weekend).  Conspiratorial beliefs  People with a tendency to think conspiratorially are more likely to deny the generally accepted notion that climate change is occurring and that humans are causing it. If an individual is already motivated to reject the scientific consensus, they may create a story conspiracies among climate scientists in an attempt to back up their claim. Those in support of free market economics are generally more likely to deny climate change, along with rejection of other mainstream science like the fact that HIV causes AIDS or that smoking causes lung cancer. Endorsement of other popular conspiracy theories predicted the denial of climate change.

Early life and background Kate Figes was the daughter of the feminist writer Eva (n√©e Unger) and John George Figes. Her brother is the historian Orlando Figes. Their mother's Jewish family fled from Nazi Germany in 1939. Figes' parents divorced when she was aged 5, both relating different accounts as to what happened. She left home at 17 after a row with her mother; the relationship between the two women remained difficult for many years. After graduating in Russian and Arabic from the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster), Figes became a sales representative for the Pandora feminist publishing house, later a publicist and editor for the same firm. Figes followed her mother's profession, although she only became a full-time writer in her thirties. \\"It‚Äôs not easy to believe you can when your own mother is one too\\", she once said. Following a part-time job as fiction editor for Cosmopolitan, leading to newspaper commissions and her appointment in 1996 as the books editor of You magazine (a supplement of The Mail on Sunday), a post she retained for the rest of her career. She wrote seven books of non-fiction and two novels. Books According to Melissa Benn, Figes wrote \\"several books on women's most profound experiences\\". Her first book, Because of Her Sex: The Myth of Equality for Women in Britain, was published in 1994, and concerned sexism. Life after Birth (1998) drew on interviews with several hundred interviews with new mothers and was a best- seller in the UK. Rebecca Abrams wrote in The Independent on Sunday, \\"combines personal opinion, anecdote, medical information, social history and (a few) statistics.\\" A decade later, Abrams described it as \\"taboo-busting\\" in laying \\"bare the secret ambivalence and confusion at the heart of many women's experience of motherhood.\\" Figes' non-fiction book on adolescence, The Terrible Teens (2002), was followed by two novels, What About Me? The diaries and emails of a menopausal mother and her teenage daughter and its sequel What About Me Too? The Big Fat Bitch Book For Girls (2008) is partly a self-help book for teenagers, while Our Cheating Hearts ‚Äì Love and Loyalty, Lust and Lies (2013) considered infidelity. For Couples: the Truth (2010), Figes interviewed 120 men and women in a relationship, both heterosexual and gay, about all aspects of their lives. Cassandra Jardine in The Daily Telegraph wrote that it is \\"a book that lingers in the mind, with a fundamentally upbeat message\\". Personal life Figes married Christopher Wyld in 1988; Wyld was then a foreign news editor for the BBC. The couple had two, now adult, daughters. Figes said in 2010 that her experience of her parents divorce left its mark on the early years of her own marriage: \\"I still spent the first 10 years of our marriage wondering when my husband was going to leave me!\\" Following the birth of her first daughter, Figes suffered from postnatal depression for a few years; diagnosis was somewhat delayed. With her brother, Figes received naturalisation papers from the German embassy in June 2017. Figes wrote: \\"We were holding out our hands in forgiveness to shake those of younger Germans, who also bore no responsibility for the past at a time of growing nationalism and suspicion of 'the other' in Europe. All of this had contributed to the making of the decision\\". Terminal illness Figes was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in September 2016 which had metatastacised. She wrote about her terminal illness in On Smaller Dogs and Larger Life Questions which was published by Virago in 2018. Figes died at home in London on 7 December 2019.

He is also credited by historian Kevin Passmore as a \\"pioneer of agrarian corporatism\\", dreaming of the day that French peasants would \\"look upon the ch√¢teau and say 'there's our star'\\". He has been named as a pioneer of agricultural syndicalism, believing syndicates would form a link between the nation's political system and its peasantry.

It is the only known analogue to the Folkton drums, discovered over a century earlier. Unlike the Folkton drums, the Lavant drum is undecorated; however, it may be that earlier markings have been worn away. The drum was associated with a sherd of Mortlake ware, which implies a Middle Neolithic date. It is currently held at Chichester Museum. Anne Teather, Andrew Chamberlain and Mike Parker Pearson have recently proposed that the Folkton and Lavant drums were tools to measure cord to standard lengths which were used in the construction of monuments such as Stonehenge and the timber circle at Durrington Walls. The circumference of each of the drums corresponds to a subdivision of 10 Neolithic 'long feet'. Chamberlain and Parker Pearson propose that the Neolithic long foot is equivalent to 1.056 modern feet or 0.3219 meters. The Lavant drum's circumference of 361.3mm corresponds to 1.1225 long feet or 1/9 of ten long feet. The drum was discovered in 1993 as part of the excavation of Chalk Pit Lane, Lavant, West Sussex. The excavation was not published due to the insolvency of Southern Archaeology, who took over the Chichester and District Archaeology Unit which carried out the original excavation. It was identified as being similar to the Folkton drum in 2005 by Anne Teather.

It is the expansion of policy and consequences for people who choose to enter illegally and subjects them to legal, political and educational debates concerning legality status.  Policy  In 1965 Congress passed amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act that placed numerical limits on immigration from the western hemisphere. This also ended longstanding guest worker agreements with Mexico. By 1976 only 20,000 legal resident visas were allocated per year to Mexico and no temporary work visas were allocated. By 1985 Ronald Reagan declared illegal immigration a threat to national security. Beginning in the 1990s, regular crossing points in Texas and California were targeted for extra guarding, such as in 1994 Operation Gatekeeper, as a way to stop crossings in heavy traffic areas. This had little effect on the flow of people across the border and instead pushed people to attempt to cross in more dangerous and secluded areas such as the Sonoran Desert which claims the lives of hundreds of immigrants per year. In 1996 Congress passed three acts aimed at illegal residents and border protection. They reduced access to safety net programs, toughened border enforcement, made it harder to claim asylum, stripped many due process rights of those in custody and expanded grounds for deportation.  Historical context   Bush administration  The Bush administration was historically the first to begin with Enforcement with Consequence policies that are used today. Before 2005 when the policy was beginning to be implemented, border patrol had been using a technique labeled \\"Catch and Release\\" which allowed for illegal immigrants who had been apprehended to immediately try to reenter. The Bush Administration originally had the plan to make a long lasting relationship with Mexico in order to streamline the process of bringing in cheap manual labor to be used in the country. During 2005 this stance had radically changed however and the beginning of using the US law as consequence for illegal entry had begum. The house bill written and proposed by James Sensenbrenner began to crack down harder and gave more offenses to aiding illegal immigrants, this included helping or and illegal, knowingly hiring an illegal and being in the country illegally. The bill was passed on December 16, 2005 and made many of these offenses punishable with Jail time. This bill created an outcry by pro immigration however and led to many demonstrations and rallies condemning the bill. This prompted many Democratic senators to begin working on a \\"grand bargain\\" which created a more balanced approach to immigration while not excluding Republican ideas outright. Immigration based on Merit (Education, Experiences and land needs), rather than family reunification was discussed. During this time Congressman Tom Tancredo (Republican-Colorado) began to voice his opinion that immigration had begun to change the way that American culture was valued. In the end the Bush administration failed in its original plan to build a relationship with Mexico and was the start of hard consequences for illegal immigration in the country.  Obama administration  The Obama administration had campaigned with a promise to address and reform the immigration System but after entering into office this idea fell to the wayside in favor of other issues plaguing American Society. In June 2012 he created the important program to help those who had entered illegally called The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or the DACA program for short, it focused on children who entered illegally against their wills and faced many hardships as a result. DACA provided protection from deportation and allowed for work authorization to young adults. It has proven to be overall successful and helped hundreds of thousands to thrive in the US, it is unfortunately constantly under threat however because of bi-partisan legislation and as a result remains under attack. The Administration is also known to have the highest deportation records of any administration and is responsible for the incarceration of millions of illegal migrants. The administration wanted to focus more on Illegal immigrants that had were a threat to society and had records. Large scale work-site raids used by the Bush Administration was done away with and a focus on investigations and penalization of employers was used instead. As a result of this stance The Fugitive Operations Act had also undergone changes so that the limited resources that were allocated to this process focused on the most dangerous fugitives and not the easiest ones. Also during this time there was a huge influx of Central American refugees who arrived at the border seeking asylum and protection and as a result the Obama Administration treated it more as an enforcement problem rather than a humanitarian problem faced by the refugees, As a result poorly constructed detention centers were created to house and deter anymore refugees from coming to the border. Most were not given fair trails or access to attorneys and the entire system was rushed creating a large number of deported individuals sent back to some of the most unstable areas in the world.  Trump administration  The Trump Administration has followed the idea of economic nationalism and as such has created an idea of America First with an emphasis on protection American workers and Industries. The policies put in place have made it extremely difficult to enter the US as an immigrant or refugee. Bans on many areas have been into place in order to restrict the amount of refugees and asylum seekers, increasing screening of refugees while cutting staff and resources to do so and work to end the DACA program were enacted in order to get a hold on refugee and migrant movement. Many of the same policies and actions used by the Obama Administration are still used such as detention centers and little to no support in the legal arena for these migrants. The focus on building the wall has also created a spotlight on the Mexican border making it even harder for illegal migrants to enter the country. Trump as also closed the border in 2018 hoping to deter people from trying to enter, but the number of asylum seeking refugees has only increased.  Criticism  To reduce recidivism, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) introduced the Consequence Delivery System (CDS) a joint initiative in December 2005. CDS enforces immigration law with criminal consequences on apprehended aliens to effectively and efficiently deter extralegal border crossings. During the Bush administration, CBP issued ‚ÄúVoluntary Return‚Äù for apprehended aliens which induced higher secondary apprehensions of 31%, a practice known as ‚ÄúCatch and Release‚Äù. The concern for the public is the cost of enforcing and applying consequences to prevent the further movement across the U.S. border. An analysis of the rate of recidivism during the period in which CDS was implemented in the southwest border sectors show the lack of consistent consequences. Such factors contribute to the notion that CDS does not impact recidivism, but rather supports a much larger strategy to prevent and deter illegal immigration. Strategically, CDS enforces consequences using the whole- of-government approach, coordination and collaboration between all levels of law enforcement. Federal prosecution, state involvement, and local law enforcement contribute to the punitive actions taken on apprehended aliens. The collaborative approach to apply consequences is effective in using the state‚Äôs available resources, but inefficiently increases costs compared to other border security measures. Most notably the Secured Border Initiative (SBI) uses prevention through deterrence by largely relying on the rugged and desolate terrain of the U.S. southwest border to impede the flow of people from the south. Comparatively, CDS uses law enforcement to apply consequence. This measure is taken to deter extralegal crossings with the threat of criminal prosecution. CDS approaches deterrence by diverting resources from federal, state, and local operations to prosecute aliens and enforce consequences. So, in using the natural environment of the U.S. southern border to enhance tactical advantage, SBI compared to CDS is a success in terms of cost. Rather than enhancing available strategies, CDS introduces new coordination in assessing apprehended aliens and strategically applying the Most Effective and Efficient consequences likely to reduce recidivism. All southwest border sectors instate the classification of aliens outlined by CDS. Criminal classification is issued when apprehended aliens are suspected smugglers, targeted smugglers, or criminal aliens. Family units, along with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd apprehensions are considered non-criminal, with greater precautions taken on persistently apprehended aliens. Alien classification provides the decision guideline for the Most Effective and Efficient consequence to apply. Effective and Efficient consequences are ordered in increasing severity in the table below. {  +Alien Classification and Most Effective and Efficient Consequence  colspan=\\"3\\" Administrative  colspan=\\"3\\" Criminal Programmatic - WN ER RR SP FP OA AT - Warrant or Notice to Appear Expedited Removal Reinstate Removal Order Streamline Prosecution Federal Prosecution Operation Against Smugglers Initiative on Safety and Security Alien Transfer Exit Program } It is important to note the variation of severity from each consequence. The circumstances of the apprehended alien project the severity of the consequence. For example, human smugglers commit transnational crimes by violating human rights, posing a high threat to national security. Such level of concern constitutes applying the harshest possible consequence under the law. As noted in Table 1, CDS proposes code OA, or Operation Against Smugglers Initiative on Safety and Security (OASISS), as the Most Effective and Efficient consequence applicable for suspected smugglers. In contrast, family unit apprehension constitutes a less serious threat to national security, and CDS concurs by issuing a Warrant or Notice to Appear (WN) as the Most Effective and Efficient consequence. This variation of severity in consequences dependent on the circumstance revolving the apprehension of the alien is a fair determinant. All nine of the border sectors enforce these criminal consequences set by CDS. For each sector of the southwest border, Alien types are ascribed the Most Efficient and Effective consequence. Variations of Most Effective and Efficient consequences for alien type and border sector during the period of FY 13 through FY 15 are formatted in the table below. {  +Most Effective and Efficient Consequence for Criminal and Non-Criminal Apprehensions FY 13- FY 15     colspan=\\"9\\" Border Sector -   Alien Type Big Bend Del R√≠o El Paso El Centro Laredo Rio Grande Valley San Diego Tucson Yuma -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"7\\"  FY 13  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"  Non-Criminal FTA WN SP WN WN WN ER WN WN SP - STA WN FP RR WN WN ER WN FP SP - PA WN WN FP AT FP WN WN FP FP - FUA RR WN WN WN WN WN ER WN WN -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" Criminal SSA RR RR ER WN ER WN OA OA FP - TSA RR FP ER WN ER ER WN OA AT - CAA WN FP ER WN WN RR FP SP WN -  colspan=\\"12\\"  -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"7\\"  FY 14  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"  Non-Criminal FTA WN FP FP AT WN WN FP SP WN - STA RR RR FP AT ER WN ER SP WN - PA FP RR FP AT RR WN FP SP FP - FUA ER WN WN WN WN WN WN WN WN -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"3\\"  Criminal SSA FP FP FP RR WN FP WN FP WN - TSA FP RR FP WN RR RR FP FP FP - CAA WN FP WN RR ER FP FP FP WN -  colspan=\\"12\\"  -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"7\\"  FY 15  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"4\\"  Non-Criminal FTA WN FP FP WN FP FP WN SP WN - STA WN RR FP WN RR FP WN SP FP - PA WN RR FP AT SP FP WN SP SP - FUA ER RR WN WN ER WN WN ER WN -  colspan=\\"1\\" rowspan=\\"3\\"  Criminal SSA RR RR FP OA SP WN FP FP FP - TSA RR RR FP ER ER SP RR FP SP - CAA WN ER RR WN FP SP FP SP WN } Although all 9 U.S. southwest border sectors enforce CDS, Border Patrol Agents are given discretion in deciding the actual consequence aliens receive. This contributes to variations in actual applied consequences. CDS, for example, in FY 13 established the Most Effective and Efficient consequences as Expedited Removal to a family unit apprehended in the Big Bend sector. In deciding the consequence to apply, Border Patrol agents are allowed to circumvent actual applied consequence that either increase or decrease in severity. This freedom of decision making given to personnel and Border Patrol agents contribute to variables, or inconsistencies in applied consequences. Border Patrol agents consider available resources the within their border sector in deciding what consequence to apply. This contributes to inconsistent enforcement of particular consequences while achieving a reduced recidivism rate. Data reflecting the resources available for each border sector are not published by DHS, so the overall performance of CBP is used to infer the effectiveness of a consequence. Streamline Prosecution, code SP under CDS, exhaust resources within CBP, DOJ, and ICE to persecute and expedite apprehended aliens. In 2015, the Office of Inspector General reported that Laredo and Del Rio were not given additional resources to execute SP operations. In FY 2014, CBP annual Performance and Accountability Reports reported a 12.5% decrease in recidivism from FY 2013 and remained stagnant through FY 2015U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

Fiscal Year 2015. https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Apr/FY%202015%20CBP%20PAR_508C.pdf CDS reflects the constraints in resource by avoiding the enforcement of SP as the Most Effective and Efficient in both sectors from FY2014 through FY2015. Although the Most Effective and Efficient consequence was not applied during FY13 through FY15, CBP reported a drop in recidivism. The Most Effective and Efficient consequences are not applied consistently but CDS continues to contribute enforcement with consequence as the main agent reducing recidivism. Rather, CDS contributes and supports the law enforcement complex at the border to prevent and deter extralegal crossings. The decrease in recidivism cannot be attributed solely to the implementation of CDS as a deterrent. CBP resources are to impeded a migrant‚Äôs illegal border crossing, or to prevent illegal immigration. High recidivism reflected in ‚ÄúCatch and Release‚Äù is the downside of enforcement dedicated only to prevention. Enforcement with consequence, the joint initiative of CBP, DOJ and ICE, enforces interior laws to prosecute and remove illegal migrants. Consequences applied under CDS is a humane and legal tool used to deter extralegal border crossings. Under SBI and CDS, contributions of DOJ and ICE reinforce CBP security at the southwest border. This network of law enforcement apprehends and removes illegal and criminal aliens to prevent and deter illegal immigration across the U.S. borders.  Consequences  Many controversies, repercussion, and dangers surrounds this practice of aggressive enforcement. The change in the policy has jeopardized basic human rights; undocumented citizens are getting mistreated, discriminated, criminalized, arrested, deported, and separated. The process has allowed the U.S. government to police and control undocumented people that are detained. ICE is targeting Latin communities, and mental health has worsened for the these communities. The United States is profiting and benefiting from mobilizing the use of private prisons and detention centers are overflowing. One of the publicly known controversy in the recent years is the Zero tolerance policy under The Trump Administration. As the enforcement continues to be carried out, more people are becoming victims from this turmoil.  Support  Trump admin calls for local police and law enforcement to join with federal immigration enforcement to create a large crackdown on removing undocumented immigrants. The intended goal is to create a relationship between law enforcement and communities so that citizens are willing to help immigration authorities and come forward with suspected undocumented status of those in the community. The US Immigration and Customs enforcement describes this program to be a way to remove threats to safety and security by working with the FBI and Department of Homeland security to utilize arrest records and fingerprint records and checking them against immigration fingerprint records. This is intended to find those illegal immigrants with a criminal record or outstanding arrest warrant, but also those who are in the United States illegally. The intention is not to create new laws or policies against illegal immigrants, only to more strictly enforce current law. Attrition through enforcement is an idea that allows the identification and removal of illegal immigrants without the intervention of immigration enforcement. This program requires compliance from local agencies to be strict about making sure social security numbers are attained and used appropriately, visas are in status, and that it is difficult for illegal immigrants to hide their illegal status.

Christmas Island is the summit plateau of an underwater volcano. It is mostly clad in tropical rainforest and has karst, cliffs, wetlands, coasts and sea. It is a small island with a land area of , 63% of which has been declared a National park. Most of the rainforest remains intact and supports a large range of endemic species of animals and plants. Geography Topography of Christmas Island The island is about long and wide. The total land area is , with of coastline. The island is the flat summit of an underwater volcano more than high, with about being submerged and only about above the surface. Some basalt is exposed in places but most of the surface rock is limestone accumulated from coral growth. The karst terrain supports numerous anchialine pools. Steep cliffs along much of the coast rise abruptly to a central plateau. The island is mainly covered by tropical rainforest, much of which remains intact. Two thirds of the island is included in the Christmas Island National Park which includes rainforests, wetlands, cliffs, shore and coral reefs. The climate is tropical and temperatures vary little throughout the year. The highest temperature of around usually occurs in March and April, while the lowest temperature is around in August. There is a dry season from July to October with only occasional showers. The wet season is between November and June, and includes monsoons and occasional tropical cyclones. Flora Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus fagifer) About 213 species of vascular plant are native to the island, with sixteen of them endemic. The rainforest on the upper slopes and central plateau consists of large evergreen trees with a canopy at and a scattering of emergent trees some high. The dominant trees are Planchonella duclitan, Syzygium nervosum, Tristiropsis acutangula, Inocarpus fagifer and Hernandia ovigera. Mid-storey species include two endemic trees, the Christmas Island palm, Arenga listeri and the screw pine Pandanus elatus. There are few shrubs, but the trunks and branches of the trees are swathed in a tangle of vines, orchids and ferns. On terraces lower down the cliffs the trees are shorter, reaching . Here the dominant species are Pisonia grandis, Gyrocarpus americanus, Gyrocarpus americanus, Terminalia catappa and Erythrina variegata. Various shrubs grow at the foot of the cliffs and on the coastal flats, sometimes in dense thickets. These include the endemic Pandanus christmatensis and Abutilon listeri, as well as certain shrubs and trees whose buoyant seeds are dispersed across the sea such as Scaevola taccada, Cordia subcordata, Morinda citrifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus and Guettarda speciosa. Fauna Christmas Island was uninhabited until the end of the nineteenth century. The island possesses no large native, terrestrial mammals and the endemic mammal fauna of the island has been largely destroyed by the introduction of exotic species such as cats, dogs and black rats (Rattus rattus). The diurnal bulldog rat (Rattus nativitatis) and the nocturnal Maclear's rat (Rattus macleari) both became extinct after the accidental introduction of the black rat. The Christmas Island shrew (Crocidura trichura) may also be extinct, and the Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi) has not been seen since 2009. The Christmas Island flying fox (Pteropus melanotus natalis), the only other endemic mammal, is declining in numbers and is considered threatened. Christmas Island red crab Rather than mammals, it is crabs that dominate the fauna. There are at least 50 species on the island, some of them endemic, 30 of them terrestrial species whose only link with the ocean is the necessity to travel to the sea to breed. Several are small and inconspicuous, but others such as the coconut crab and Christmas Island red crab are large and present in enormous numbers. In the late twentieth century there were estimated to be about 120 million red crabs on the island, and the mass migration made by the mature individuals to the coast was spectacular. The red crabs are a keystone species, feeding on the forest floor on leaves, fallen fruits, flowers, seedlings and carrion and maintaining a lawn-like turf. In the twenty-first century the number of red crabs has reduced considerably because of the accidental introduction of the yellow crazy ant to the island; this invasive species has formed supercolonies, killed crabs and had a profound impact on the biodiversity of the island. The karst limestone areas are riddled with caves and sink-holes, some of the underground water-filled cavities being saline. These underground habitats have been imperfectly sampled, but at least twelve endemic subterranean invertebrates are known including some such as ostracods, the cave shrimp Procaris noelensis and a blind scorpion, that may be relicts from the Mesozoic fauna of the Tethys Ocean. The island is fringed by coral reefs and nearly seven hundred species of marine fish have been recorded in the surrounding waters as well as three species of marine turtle and about a dozen species of whales and dolphins. Christmas Island is recognised by BirdLife International as being an Important Bird Area, mostly because of the breeding populations of seabirds. These include the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies in bushes and trees, the brown booby, which nests on cliffs, and the endemic Abbott's booby which nests on tall, emergent trees. Another endemic bird, the Christmas frigatebird, nests on the shore terraces, and the great frigatebird nests in semi-deciduous trees nearby. The brown noddy and two species of tropicbird also nest on the island. Land birds include four endemic species, the Christmas thrush, the Christmas imperial pigeon, the Christmas white-eye and the Christmas Island hawk-owl, and several endemic sub-species. Over a hundred migrants and vagrant species of bird have been recorded on the island.

New implications of changing conditions on the efficiency of different approaches to design and planning can be addressed in the following term. Design systems react differently to shock events. The following graph represents ways in which systems respond and possibly adapt based on their resilience. Origin of the term resilience According to the dictionary, resilience means \\"the ability to recover from difficulties or disturbance.\\" The root of the term resilience is found in the Latin term 'resilio' which means to go back to a state or to spring back. In the 1640s the root term provided a resilience in the field of the mechanics of materials as \\"the ability of a material to absorb energy when it is elastically deformed and to release that energy upon unloading\\". By 1824, the term had developed to encompass the meaning of ‚Äòelasticity‚Äô. 19th century resilience Thomas Tredgold was the first to introduce the concept of resilience in 1818 in England. The term was used to describe a property in the strength of timber, as beams were bent and deformed to support heavy load. Tredgold found the timber durable and did not burn readily, despite being planted in bad soil conditions and exposed climates. Resilience was then refined by Mallett in 1856 in relation to the capacity of specific materials to withstand specific disturbances. These definitions can be used in engineering resilience due to the application of a single material that has a stable equilibrium regime rather than the complex adaptive stability of larger systems. 20th century resilience In the 1970s, researchers studied resilience in relation to child psychology and the exposure to certain risks. Resilience was used to describe people who have ‚Äúthe ability to recover from adversity.‚Äù One of the many researchers was Professor Sir Michael Rutter, who was concerned with a combination of risk experiences and their relative outcomes. In his paper Resilience and Stability of Ecological systems (1973), Holling first explored the topic of resilience through its application to the field of ecology. Ecological resilience was defined as a ‚Äúmeasure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between state variables.‚Äù Holling found that such a framework can be applied to other forms of resilience. The application to ecosystems was later used to draw into other manners of human, cultural and social applications.The random events described by Holling are not only climatic, but instability to neutral systems can occur through the impact of fires, the changes in forest community or the process of fishing. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance. Multiple state systems and conditions rather than objects should be studied as the world is a heterogeneous space with various biological, physical and chemical characteristics. Unlike material and engineering resilience, Ecological and social resilience focus on the redundancy and persistence of multi-equilibrium states to maintain existence of function.  Engineering resilience  Four Rs of Resilience Engineering resilience refers to the functionality of a system in relation to hazard mitigation. Within this framework, resilience is calculated based on the time it takes a system to return to a single state equilibrium. Researchers at the MCEER (Multi-Hazard Earthquake Engineering research center) have identified four properties of resilience: Robustness, resourcefulness, redundancy and rapidity. * Robustness: the ability of systems to withstand a certain level of stress without suffering loss of function. * Resourcefulness: the ability to identify problems and resources when threats may disrupt the system. * Redundancy: the ability to have various paths in a system by which forces can be transferred to enable continued function * Rapidity: the ability to meet priorities and goals in time to prevent losses and future disruptions.  Social-ecological resilience  also known as adaptive resilience, social-ecological resilience is a new concept that shifts the focus to combining the social, ecological and technical domains of resilience. The adaptive model focuses on the transformable quality of the stable state of a system. In adaptive buildings, both short term and long term resilience are addressed to ensure that the system can withstand disturbances with social and physical capacities. Buildings operate at multiple scale and conditions, therefore it is important to recognize that constant changes in architecture are expected. Laboy and Fannon recognize that the resilience model is shifting, and have applied the MCEER four properties of resilience to the planning, designing and operating phases of architecture. Rather than using four properties to describe resilience, Laboy and Fannon suggest a 6R model that adds Recovery for the operation phase of a building and Risk Avoidance for the planning phase of the building. In the planning phase of a building, site selection, building placement and site conditions are crucial for the risk avoidance. Early planning can help prepare and design for the built environment based on forces that we understand and perceive. In the operation phase of the building, a disturbance does not mark the end of resilience, but should propose a recovery plan for future adaptations. Disturbances should we be used as a learning opportunity to assess mistakes and outcomes, and reconfigure for future needs.  Applications   Resilience in International Building Code  The international building code provides minimum requirements for buildings using performative based standards. The most recent International Building Code (IBC)was released in 2018 by the International Code Council (ICC), focusing on standards that protect public health, safety and welfare, without restricting use of certain building methods. The code addresses several categories, which are updated every three years to incorporate new technologies and changes. Building codes are fundamental to the resilience of communities and their buildings, as ‚ÄúResilience in the built environment starts with strong, regularly adopted and properly administered building codes‚Äù Benefits occur due to the adoption of codes as the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) found that the adoption of the International Building Code provides an 11$ benefit for every 1$ invested. The International Code Council is focused on assuming the community‚Äôs buildings support the resilience of communities ahead of disasters. The process presented by the ICC includes understanding the risks, identifying strategies for the risks, and implementing those strategies. Risks vary based on communities, geographies and other factors. The American Institute of Architects created a list of shocks and stresses that are related to certain community characteristics. Shocks are natural forms of hazards (floods, earthquakes), while stresses are more chronic events that can develop over a longer period of time (affordability, drought). It is important to understand the application of resilient design on both shocks and stresses as buildings can play a part in contributing to their resolution. Even though the IBC is a model code, it is adopted by various state and governments to regulate specific building areas. Most of the approaches to minimizing risks are organized around building use and occupancy. In addition, the safety of a structure is determined by material usage, frames, and structure requirements can provide a high level of protection for occupants. Specific requirements and strategies are provided for each shock or stress such as with tsunamis, fires and earthquakes.  U.S Resiliency Council  The U.S Resiliency Council (USRC), a non-profit organization, created the USRC Rating system which describes the expected impacts of a natural disaster on new and existing buildings. The rating considers the building prior to its use through its structure, Mechanical-Electrical systems and material usage. Currently, the program is in its pilot stage, focusing primarily on earthquake preparedness and resilience. For earthquake hazards, the rating relies heavily on the requirements set by the Building codes for design. Buildings can obtain one of the Two types of USRC rating systems: = USRC Verified Rating System = The verified Rating system is used for marketing and publicity purposes using badges. The rating is easy to understand, credible and transparent at is awarded by professionals. The USRC building rating system rates buildings with stars ranging from one to five stars based on the dimensions used in their systems. The three dimensions that the USRC uses are Safety, Damage and Recovery. Safety describes the prevention of potential harm for people after an event. Damage describes the estimated repair required due to replacements and losses. Recovery is calculated based on the time it takes for the building to regain function after a shock. The following types of Rating certification can be achieved: * USRC Platinum: less than 5% of expected damage * USRC Gold: less than 10% of expected damage * USRC Silver: less than 20% of expected damage * USRC Certified: less than 40% of expected damage Earthquake Building rating system can be obtained through hazard evaluation and seismic testing. In addition to the technical review provided by the USRC, A CRP seismic analysis applies for a USRC rating with the required documentation. The USRC is planning on creating similar standards for other natural hazards such as floods, storms and winds. = USRC Transaction Rating System = Transaction rating system provides a building with a report for risk exposure, possibly investments and benefits. This rating remains confidential with the USRC and is not used to publicize or market the building. = Disadvantages of the USRC rating system = Due to the current focus on seismic interventions, the USRC does not take into consideration several parts of a building. The USRC building rating system does not take into consideration any changes to the design of the building that might occur after the rating is awarded. Therefore, changes that might impede the resilience of a building would not affect the rating that the building was awarded. In addition, changes in the uses of the building after certification might include the use of hazardous materials would not affect the rating certification of the building. The damage rating does not include damage caused by pipe breakage, building upgrades and damage to furnishings. The recovery rating does not include fully restoring all building function and all damages but only a certain amount.  The 100 Resilient Cities Program  In 2013, The 100 Resilient Cities Program was initiated by the Rockefeller foundation, with the goal to help cities become more resilient to physical, social and economic shocks and stresses. The program helps facilitate the resilience plans in cities around the world through access to tools, funding and global network partners such as ARUP and the AIA. Of 1,000 cities that applied to join the program, only 100 cities were selected with challenges ranging from aging populations, cyber attacks, severe storms and drug abuse. There are many cities that are members of the program, but in the article, Building up resilience in cities worldwide, Spaans and Waterhot focus on the city of Rotterdam to compare the city‚Äôs resilience before and after the participation in the program. The authors found that the program broadens the scope and improved the Resilience plan of Rotterdam by including access to water, data, clean air, cyber robustness, and safe water. The program addresses other social stresses that can weaken the resilience of cities such as violence and unemployment. Therefore, cities are able to reflect on their current situation and plan to adapt to new shocks and stresses. The findings of the article can support the understanding of resiliency at a larger urban scale that requires an integrated approach with coordination across multiple government scales, time scales and fields. In addition to integrating resiliency into building code and building certification programs, the 100 resilience Cities program provides other support opportunities that can help increase awareness through non-profit organizations. After more than six years of growth and change, the existing 100 Resilient Cities organization concluded on July 31, 2019.  RELi Rating System  RELi is a design criteria used to develop resilience in multiple scales of the built environment such as buildings, neighborhoods and infrastructure. It was developed by the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability (MTS) to help designers plan for hazards. RELi is very similar to LEED but with a focus on resilience. RELi is now owned by the U.S Green Building Council (USGBC) and available to projects seeking LEED certification. The first version of RELi was released in 2014, it is currently still in the pilot phase, with no points allocated for specific credits. RELi accreditation is not required, and the use of the credit information is voluntary. Therefore, the current point system is still to be determined and does not have a tangible value. RELi provides a credit catalog that is used a s a reference guide for building design and expands on the RELi definition of resilience as follows: > Resilient Design pursues Buildings + Communities that are shock resistant, > healthy, adaptable and regenerative through a combination of diversity, > foresight and the capacity for self-organization and learning. A Resilient > Society can withstand shocks and rebuild itself when necessary. It requires > humans to embrace their capacity to anticipate, plan and adapt for the > future. = RELi Credit Catalog = The RELi Catalog considers multiple scales of intervention with requirements for a panoramic approach, risk adaptation & mitigation for acute events and a comprehensive adaptation & mitigation for the present and future. RELi's framework highly focuses on social issues for community resilience such as providing community spaces and organisations. RELi also combines specific hazard designs such as flood preparedness with general strategies for energy and water efficiency. The following categories are used to organize the RELi credit list: * Panoramic approach to Planning, design, Maintenance and Operations * Hazard Preparedness * Hazard adaptation and mitigation * Community cohesion, social and economic vitality * Productivity, health and diversity * Energy, water, food * Materials and artifacts * Applied creativity, innovation and exploration The RELI Program complements and expands on other popular rating systems such as LEED, Envision, and Living Building Challenge. The menu format of the catalog allows users to easily navigate the credits and recognize the goals achieved by RELI. References to other rating systems that have been used can help increase awareness on RELi and its credibility of its use. The reference for each credit is listed in the catalog for ease of access.  LEED Pilot Credits  In 2018, three new LEED pilot credits were released to increase awareness on specific natural and man-made disasters. The pilot credits are found in the Integrative Process category and are applicable to all Building Design and Construction rating systems. * The first credit IPpc98: Assessment and Planning for Resilience, includes a prerequisite for a hazard assessment of the site. It is crucial to take into account the site conditions and how they change with variations in the climate. Projects can either choose to do a climate-related risk plan or can complete planning forms presented by the Red Cross. * The second credit IPpc99: Assessment and Planning for Resilience, requires projects to prioritize three top hazards based on the assessments made in the first credit. specific mitigation strategies for each hazard have to be identified and implemented. Reference to other resilience programs such as the USRC should be made to support the choice of hazards. * The third credit IPpc100: Passive Survivability and Functionality During Emergencies, focuses on maintaining livable and functional conditions during a disturbance. Projects can demonstrate the ability to provide emergency power for high priority functions, can maintain livable temperatures for a certain period of time, and provide access to water. For thermal resistance, reference to thermal modeling of the comfort tool's psychrometric chart should be made to support the thermal qualities of the building during a certain time. As for emergency power, backup power must last based on the critical loads and needs of the building use type. LEED credits overlap with RELi rating system credits, the USGBC has been refining RELi to better synthesize with the LEED resilient design pilot credits.  Design based on climate change  It is important to assess current climate data and design in preparation of changes or threats to the environment. Resilience plans and passive design strategies can differ based on climates that are too hot. Here are general climate responsive design strategies based on three different climatic conditions: = Too Wet = * Use of Natural solutions: mangroves and other shoreline plants can act as barriers to flooding. * Creating a Dike system: in areas with extreme floods, dikes can be integrated into the urban landscape to protect buildings. * Using permeable paving: porous pavement surfaces absorb runoff in parking lots, roads and sidewalks. * Rain Harvesting methods: collect and store rainwater for domestic or landscape purposes. = Too Dry = * Use of drought-tolerant plants: save water usage in landscaping methods * Filtration of wastewater: recycling wastewater for landscaping or toilet usage. * Use of courtyard layout: minimize the area affected by solar radiation and use water and plants for evaporative cooling. = Too Hot = * Use of vegetation: Trees can help cool the environment by reducing the urban heat island effect through evapotranspiration. * Use of passive solar-design strategies: operable windows and thermal mass can cool the building down naturally. * Window Shading strategies: control the amount of sunlight that enters the building to minimize heat gains during the day.  Design based on hazards  = Hazard assessment = Determining and assessing vulnerabilities to the built environment based on specific locations is crucial for creating a resilience plan. Disasters lead to a wide range of consequences such as damaged buildings, ecosystems and human losses. For example, earthquakes that took place in the Wenchuan County in 2008, lead to major landslides which relocated entire city district such as Old Beichuan. Here are some natural hazards and potential strategies for resilience assessment.  Fire  * use of fire rated materials * provide fire- resistant stairwells for evacuation * universal escape methods to also help those with disabilities.  Hurricanes  There are multiple strategies for protecting structures against hurricanes, based on wind and rain loads. * Openings should be protected form flying debris * Structures should be elevated from possible water intrusion and flooding * Building enclosures should be sealed with specific nailing patterns * use of materials such as metal, tile or masonry to resist wind loads.  Earthquakes  Earthquakes can also result in the structural damage and collapse of buildings due to high stresses on building frames. * Secure appliances such as heaters and furniture to prevent injury and fires * expansion joints should be used in building structure to respond to seismic shaking. * create flexible systems with base isolation to minimize impact * provide earthquake preparedness kit with necessary resources during event  Resilience and sustainability  It is difficult to discuss the concepts of resilience and sustainability in comparison due to the various scholarly definitions that have been used in the field over the years. Many policies and academic publications on both topics either provide their own definitions of both concepts or lack a clear definition of the type of resilience they seek. Even though sustainability is a well established term, there are generic interpretations of the concept and its focus. Sanchez et al proposed a new characterization of the term ‚Äòsustainable resilience‚Äô which expands the social-ecological resilience to include more sustained and long-term approaches. Sustainable resilience focuses not only on the outcomes, but also on the processes and policy structures in the implementation. Both concepts share essential assumptions and goals such as passive survivability and persistence of a system operation over time and in response to disturbances. There is also a shared focus on climate change mitigation as they both appear in larger frameworks such as Building Code and building certification programs. Holling and Walker argue that ‚Äúa resilient sociol-ecological system is synonymous with a region that is ecological, economically and socially sustainable.‚Äù Other scholars such as Perrings state that ‚Äúa development strategy is not sustainable if it is not resilient.‚Äù https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a7ed/c96e2db8f987cc4c4d998afd699552275734.pdf/Therefore, the two concepts are intertwined and cannot be successful individually as they are dependent on one another. For example, in RELi and in LEED and other building certifications, providing access to safe water and an energy source is crucial before, during and after a disturbance. Some scholars argue that resilience and sustainability tactics target different goals. Paula Melton argues that resilience focuses on the design for unpredictable, while sustainability focuses on the climate responsive designs. Some forms of resilience such as adaptive resilience focus on designs that can adapt and change based on a shock event, on the other hand, sustainable design focuses on systems that are efficient and optimized.

The term \\"scalzo\\" makes reference to the barefoot brother who carried the Cross during its public processions. The west wall \\"Compagnia\\" (English: \\"company\\") was the name given to these Florentine congregations of layman who contributed towards defending Roman Catholicism. Each company had a different practice: the \\"Laudesi\\" promoted prayer through the singing of hymns, those for the doctrine taught catechism to children, while the charitable companies offered assistance to the poor. The Compagnia della Scalzo was a disciplined confraternity that practiced penance, often in the form of self-flagellation. The Compagnia della Scalzo was established in 1376, and used the church of San Giovannino dei Cavalieri on the via San Gallo as early as 1390 for its meetings. When the company purchased land behind this church in the first half of the 15th century, it proceeded towards creating its own premises, which included a chapel (consecrated in 1476, but then totally renovated), the cloister and entrance (1478) still visible today. Back in 1455, it underwent a reform approved by the bishop of Florence, Antoninus, who was made saint in 1523 and who is portrayed in the painted terra-cotta bust now placed in front of the former doorway that led to the chapel. Painted terra-cotta over the entrance The brothers wore black hoods with holes to see through and a heavy, black over garment tied around the waist with a white cord; such apparel is documented in the polychrome glazed terra-cotta relief depicting St. John the Baptist and Two Brothers (1510 c.) over the entrance to the cloister from via Cavour. Every first Sunday of the month the company organized a procession and every June 24, the festivities in honor of the city's and its own patron saint, John the Baptist, which today see events like the famous fireworks (I fochi di san Giovanni).  The Cloister  The space of the rectangular-shaped cloister was once divided by 6 columns; in bad weather, a straw mat was attached to cover the opening in the slanted roof. Wooden benches lined the walls. Around 1508-1509, Andrea del Sarto, who was a member of the Scalzo, received a commission from the brothers to paint a series of murals in grisaille, tones of grey, with scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist. He worked on these for many years, interrupting his work on a number of occasions. In 1518-1519, while in France, Andrea was replaced by Francesco di Cristofano who painted two of the scenes. Andrea del Sarto completed the Scalzo cycle in 1526. In 1722, architect Pietro Giovannozzi made substantial modifications to the original structure by adding the groin vault ceiling, the broken pediments over the doors and the four double columns at the corners. The lunettes that were created from the new vaults were decorated in a style that tried to imitate the 16th-century style of the frescoes. when the company was suppressed in 1786, part of the chapel which opened up on what is today via Cavour and the cloister was acquired by Pietro Leopoldo of Lorraine, Grand Duke of Tuscany, while the rest of the property, which included the church, was put up for sale and refitted for other purposes. The cloister was then under the control of the Accademia di Belle Arti before being taken over by the government which opened the Scalzo to the public in 1891. It remained closed for many years and was finally reopened in 1995, when the detached and restored frescoes were reinstalled.  The Frescoes  The murals comprise twelve scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist and form a narrative that begins to the right of the entrance. The first scene is the Annunciation to Zachary (1523), followed by The Visitation (1524), then The Birth of the Baptist (1526), The Blessing of the Young St. John (1519), Meeting of Jesus and the Young St. John the Baptist in the Desert (1518), The Baptism of the Christ (ca. 1509-1510), The Baptist Preaching to the Crowds (1515), The Baptism of the Crowds (1517), St. John's Capture (1517), The Dance of Salome (1522), The Beheading of St. John the Baptist (1523), and The Presentation of the Head of St. John the Baptist (1523). The date of each scene does not follow the narrative sequence. {  + !01 Annunciation to Zachary, Andrea del Sarto !02 The Visitation, Andrea del Sarto !03 Birth of the Baptist, Andrea del Sarto - 04 Blessing of the Young St. John, Francesco di Cristofano 05 Meeting of Jesus and the Young St John, Francesco di Cristofano 06 Baptism of Christ, Andrea del Sarto - 07 Baptist Preaching to the Crowds, Andrea del Sarto 08 Baptism of the Crowds, Andrea del Sarto 09 St. John's Capture, Andrea del Sarto - 10 Dance of Salome, Andrea del Sarto 11 Beheading of St. John, Andrea del Sarto 12 Presentation of the Head of St. John, Andrea del Sarto } The cycle also includes four figures representing Christian virtues into tromp l'oeil niches to look like sculptures: Faith (ca. 1523) and Hope (1523), flank the entrance and carry the Latin inscription \\"Laudate Dominum in trio sancto eius\\" (\\"Praise the Lord in His holy place\\"), while Charity (ca. 1513) and Justice (1515) flank the former passage way into the chapel with another Latin phrase, \\"Introbibo in Domum Tuam\\" (\\"I shall enter your household\\"). The narrative scheme is framed by pilasters and cornices decorated with patterns. Such pictorial elements blend with the architecture of the cloister. The main artist here is Andrea del Sarto (Florence, 1486-1530), whose portrait can be admired in the plaster bust placed over the entrance by Domenico Geri (1724). Andrea was one of the greatest painters of his time and was called by the biographer Giorgio Vasari in his 1568 edition of Lives \\"a most excellent artist\\", \\"without error\\". Andrea worked in all media - drawings, oil paint and fresco - and received altar piece commissions as well as devotional scenes, portraits as well as mythological subjects. Although he created his own style, he was influenced by Flemish and German prints (e.g. Albrecht D√ºrer and Lucas van Leyden), antique sculpture, particularly Hellenistic, the great masters of Florentine figurative art (Masaccio, Ghiberti and Ghirlandaio) and the high renaissance style of his contemporaries such as Michelangelo and Raphael. As in other cases, del Sarto called for the collaboration of fellow artist Francesco di Cristofano, known as Il Franciabigio (Florence, 1424 - ca. 1525), who shared a workshop with him. In the two scenes at the Scalzo by Franciabigio, The Blessing of the Young St. John in the Desert and The Meeting of Jesus and the Young St. John in the Desert, a less formal and more intimate atmosphere is achieved. Paintings by both these artists are housed in the major state museums in Florence - the Palatine Gallery in Pitti Palace, the Uffizi Gallery, the Museum of Andrea del Sartio's Last Supper at San Salvi, and the Accademia. Other major fresco cycles can be admired at Santissima Annunziata, the in Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano and at San Salvi. The frescoes were removed using the strappo technique by Leonetto Tintori between February, 1963 and July, 1968. They were exhibited 1968-69 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Rijks museum in Amsterdam, and the Hayward Gallery in London.  Iconography  Important sources for the general design and content of the scenes can be found in the many art works in Florence dedicated to the life of the patron saint of the city. Major works depicting St. John the Baptist can be found in the Baptistry (the mosaics on the vault, the bronze doors by Andrea Pisano, and the great silver altar now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) in the frescoes by Giotto for the Peruzzi Chapel in the church of Santa Croce, those by Filippo Lippi in the cathedral of Prato and, the frescoes by Ghirlandaio for the Chancel, or Tornabuoni Chapel in Santa Maria Novella.

Edinburgh: Birlinn. . p. 196 The tower has been much altered with Gothic windows added when the building was altered to become a folly on the Eglinton Estate.Love, p.68 The coat of arms of the Montgomery's of Stane and Greenfield were placed on the tower, being the same as those of Eglinton, but with 'proper distinction'. This may account for the coat of arms being thought to be upside down. The foundations of the Stanecastle chapel were found a by Mr W Gray when digging drains. Judging from the foundations, the building must have been of considerable extent. The 1858 OS map marks the site of a nearby cemetery and an intriguing subterranean passage or vault four feet below the surface; nothing is visible at the site today. A small village once existed here and Stanecastle may have been the site of a nunnery before it became the home of the Francis family. In the 17th century the twenty shilling lands of old extent called Brydskirk are recorded, but with no mention of a chapel.Strawhorn, John (1985). The History of Irvine. Pub. John Donald. . P. 30. Etymology The term 'Thorn' in Lawthorn may derive from 'torn, thorn, a tower', as in Jocks-Thorn on Cumbrae and in Kilmaurs, \\"alias Jock-Torn; and head, an eminence; hence tower-hill.\\"Cumbrae Local Names Accessed: 2015-01-05 'Thorn' occurs in words meaning ‚Äòassembly‚Äô, ‚Äòmeeting place‚Äô and ‚Äòpiece of land' or ‚Äòclearing‚Äô.Ordnance Survey Language Resources Accessed: 2019-12-08 Lawthorn Mount The barrow and the large greywacke stone. Lawthorn Mount or 'The Thorn' is a scheduled monument classified as \\"Prehistoric ritual and funerary: mound, ritual or funerary\\"Ancient Monuments. History on the GroundListed of Scheduled Ancient Monuments - North Ayrshire Regarded as a large and prehistoric cairn or barrow, a type of tumulus, a burial mound dating within the time period approximately 1300‚Äì700 BC, the Bronze Age. It is the highest point in the locality and its prominence is in keeping with barrows, cairns and other such burial sites. The name 'Lawthorn' is suggestive of a secondary use as court hill or justice hill, which is the strong local oral tradition.Canmore - Lawthorn Mount The many 'Law Hills' in Scotland are considered to be ancient seats of justice where feudal justice was dispensed, investitures confirmed and other courts held before tolbooths were built.Mackenzie, W.C. (1931). Scottish Pace-Names. London : Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. p.63. Stanecastle was the caput of the Barony of Stane and Lawthorn Mount may have been the location where the baronial court convened. No 'gallows' place-names are recorded for the vicinity however the Annick Water is nearby regarding judicial drownings of females as per the power of 'pit and gallows' then held by the laird or baron. It measures 21 paces in diameter at the base, in diameter at the top and high; is largely composed of boulders and one particularly large boulder of graywacke stone, long, is partially buried on the top edge facing south, above any possible kerb stones. The significance of this distinctive stone is unknown, however, the name 'stone' for the barony, the nearby place-names 'Stonemuir' and 'Lawthorn Mickle Stone' are suggestive a fallen or deliberately levelled standing stone. Given that the name 'William Frawnces de le Stane' is recorded from 1407 the place-name 'Stane' is unlikely to refer to the castle itself being built of stone to replace an earlier wooden one. An unofficial dig in the 20th century revealed no finds such as graves, etc.Smith. p. 123. Lawthorn Mount has also have been as the possible site of an early castle constructed from wood although no physical evidence has been found as yet to corroborate this.Strawhorn, p.31 This much disturbed mound is clearly artificial and its size has been confused by a surrounding protective bank suggestive of a roundel created as part of landscaping works. A Cairnmount Plantation is located nearby to the north and a modern Cairnmount has been built on an artificial mound at Sourlie in Eglinton Country Park. =Girdle Mount= Old road bridge and railway trackbed near Lawthorn Primary School Another well preserved mound stood nearby at Girdle Toll however it was demolished in 1852.Strawhorn, p.2 This mound was circa 30 feet in diameter and around 3 feet high. A turf dyke also surrounded it and this was surmounted by a thorn hedge. In the vicinity were a number of trees, mainly beech.Smith, p.124 Coal mining In the census of 1820 there were five households with colliers at Lawthorn.Strawhorn, p.120 The Glasgow and South Western Railway (Perceton Branch) ran from north to south through the area passing close to Littlestane. This was purely a standard gauge mineral line used to transport coal from the nearby collieries. Sections of the route are now used by pedestrians and cyclists. Lawthorn Wood The western edge of Lawthorn Wood Nature Reserve This woodland is a Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserve and is a small, mature deciduous woodland. The tall canopy is now dominated by ash trees, with some beech and sycamore. The elm trees that were once common have died through Dutch elm disease however they have been left and their trunks encourage fungus growth and also provide nesting sites for bats and birds, including great spotted woodpecker. Standing water in a hollow adds to the species diversity of the site, including a locally uncommon plant, the water figwort. Scottish Wildlife Trust - Lawthorn Wood The shape of the woodland boundary suggests that approximately half of the main wood was felled prior to 1856. In 1826 the wood ran down to the road and extended southwards as far as Stanecastle. Parts of this wood survive with a number of old trees, running as far as the main road and bordering Lawthorn Primary School. The Farms of Lawthorn Lawthorn Farm itself stands close to Lawthorn Mount. In 1855-57 it was described as a good farm steading with outer buildings used as offices and the tenant under the Earl of Eglinton was a James Dunlop.Lawthorn - OS Name Book. Littlestone or Littlestane Farm stood on a lane off the western side of the nearby road and is shown as such in 1856. A Stone Farm once stood opposite Lawthorn Wood and is recalled by inference in the names 'Littlestane' and the old Littlestane Loch. William Roy's map published in 1752-55 shows Stone Farm lying in between Lawthorn Farm and Littlestone Farm with several buildings and hedged enclosures approached by a lane branching off the road to Stanecastle.Roy Military Survey of Scotland, 1747-1755 Stone Farm is still shown in 1826 but is not indicated on the 1856 OS mapAyrshire, Sheet XVII (includes: Dreghorn; Irvine; Kilmaurs; Kilwinning; Stewarton) Survey date:1856 Publication date:1860 The site of the old Stane Farm is today marked by rubble, a building platform, field boundaries and the line of an entrance lane. Two likely farms are recorded, one as 'Lawthorn Mickle Stone' in John Thomson's 1828 Atlas of Scotland, published in 1832. One may be 'Lawthorn' and the other 'Stane'John Thomson's 1828 Atlas of Scotland, published in 1832. The use of the name 'mickle' in farming usually refers to the larger of the two farms made up of unequal portions of an older area of land following the agricultural reconstruction of the 18th centuryDictionary of Scots as was the case on the Eglinton Estates as introduced by Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton.

Since its inception, users have contributed over 80,000 submissions in 23 languages to the platform.  History  In 2017, Canadian artist and designer Lucas LaRochelle began working on Queering the Map for a class project at Concordia University in Montreal. The project was launched in May of the same year. LaRochelle has cited the lasting impact of personal memories on their perceptions towards places and Sara Ahmed's ideas on queerness as an orientation towards space as influences behind the project. For LaRochelle, a queer space can be a relational experience created by and/or shared between queer people. LaRochelle has stated that their main intent for initiating the project was to archive these spaces, which transcend the traditional notion of queer spaces as fixed places (like businesses or neighborhoods) that are reclaimed by clearly defined communities. In February 2018, Montreal DJ Frankie Teardrop shared Queering the Map on Facebook, greatly increasing its visibility. During this month, the number of pins on the map increased from 600 to 6,500 within a three-day span. The same month, a cyberattack generating pins with comments in support of U.S. president Donald Trump forced LaRochelle to take down the site and ask for help on its URL. Over the next two months, 8 volunteers developed a more secure version of the site on GitHub, and the project qualified for Cloudflare's free Project Galileo cybersecurity service. Notably, a moderation system was developed for the platform through this process. In April 2018, Queering the Map was relaunched. In 2019, LaRochelle began developing QT.bot, an artificial neural network trained to generate hypothetical queer stories using the data submitted to Queering the Map.  Reception  Queering the Map has received press coverage through media outlets based in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Spain, Switzerland, the UK and the U.S., including Autostraddle, CBC Arts, CityNews, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Fugues, Numerama, Paper, rabble.ca, The McGill Daily, The Skinny, VICE and VOGUE.  Accolades  In 2018, Queering the Map received an honorary mention at the Prix Ars Electronica and was longlisted for the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards and the Lumen Prize for Digital Art.

The full point system is shown in the table on the right. In a Mass start event only 30 athletes are allowed to participate and the points awarded for ranks 22 to 30 differ from the system used in other events. Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores. Ties in this score are broken by comparing the tied athletes' number of victories. If this number is the same for the athletes in question, the number of second places is compared, and so on. If a tie cannot be broken by this procedure, it remains a tie. {  center; font-size: 80%;\\" ! # ! Name ! √ñST ! √ñST ! HOC ! HOC ! LGB ! LGB ! LGB ! OBE ! OBE ! RUH ! RUH ! POK ! POK ! ANT ! ANT !

Activism  In 1946, with her friends and colleagues at Gordon Memorial College, Mahasin Abed Alaal and Khalda Zahir, Talib founded the Women's Cultural Society (Jam'ee'yat alfata'yat althaqa'fia) in Omdurman. The society was designed to educate and empower women and provide social support for them. In order to function, the society needed the support of the British authorities, so was advertised solely as a social concern, however it had political undertones. Nine women joined immediately, but the society only lasted for two years. Despite its short life, it is important as it was the first women-only organisation to be established in Sudan. In 1949, Talib became the first female member of the Muslim Brotherhood. She was joined by sisters from the Al-Mahdi family and together they founded the Women‚Äôs Development Society. In 1952, with Khalda Zahir and others, Talib founded the Sudanese Women's Union (ÿßŸÑÿßÿ™ÿ≠ÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ≥ÿßÿ¶Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸàÿØÿßŸÜŸä al Etihaad al Nisaa'i alSudani). This organisation was designed to unite and promote women's issues. The first executive committee was made up of Fatima Talib Isma'il, Khalida Zahir and Fatima Ahmed Ibrahim. Talib was President of the Union from 1952-6. The establishment of the Union was one of the most important events in the struggle against colonialism in Sudan. It enabled women to mobilise to understand and protect their social, economic and civil rights. It was set up under pan-Africanist and socialist ideologies.  Early life  Talib was born on 1 January 1928 in Al-Rank, in southern Sudan. Her father was an army officer who was one of the leaders in the 1924 revolution. She was educated at Unity High School in Khartoum and from there was the first woman from Sudan to obtain a degree London University.  Career  Talib was the first woman in Sudan to become the headmistress of a secondary school. During her career she worked in Yemen, delivering plans for women's education. In 2004, Talib was interviewed about her role in Sudanese feminism.

Biography  Al-Tagtaga was born in 1926 in El-Rahad, Abu-Dakna district in North Kordufan. Her father was a Sufi and her mother a poet. From a young age she wanted to be a singer, but her family were opposed to this and married her to a cousin, who she later divorced so she follow a career in music. She moved to Khartoum when she was fourteen-years old to do this and soon after her arrival, her singing voice was in demand for wedding parties. Her work developed into the wider role of the ghanaya - a woman who is responsible for getting a bride ready for marriage, including teaching the bride to dance, bathing and massaging them and passing on information about sexual relations. During the Second World War she sang to entertain Sudanese soldiers. There are two rumours about why her name changed: one that she was given the nickname by British authorities as she was demonstrating in every major town; the other that her voice was likened to a specific type of palm tree.  Political Life  Al-Tagtaga joined the popular struggle against British colonialism and was famous throughout Sudan for her political activism and singing. She was a member of the Brothers Party, led by Ismail Al-Azari. She was arrested by the British government on several occasions, as well as being shot when Al-Azari raised the new Sudanese flag. Along with Hasan Khalifa al-Atbarawi, she was arrested on the eve of the revolution in 1956 for singing nationalist songs at the Labour Theatre in Atbara and jailed for three months. She had her front teeth knocked out by British troops whilst participating in a demonstration with the wife of Sudanese revolutionist Ali Abdel Latif. After Al-Azari's election, Al-Tagtaga wrote a new song praising his wisdom and education, but also teasing those who now regretted not joining his movement: \\"Those who denounced you, they regretted / You won the state election / God bless your ideas and thoughts / Which represent your knowledge and wisdom / You have skilfully won our independence/ from the greatest country [England]\\"  Musical career  She sang for a variety of famous people including Yasser Arafat, and sang at the wedding of King Farouk of Egypt and Narriman Sadek. In later life, Al-Tagtaga was recorded singing on the television programme Names in our Lives. She was an exponent of the important role television and radio could play in people's lives, particularly in bridging gaps between generations.  Later life  Al-Tagtaga lived out her life in Omdurman, but she never married, choosing she said a life as a singer. As one of the last survivors of the revolution, she became a spokesperson for it, presenting television shows and receiving honours from Omar al-Bashir. She died aged 86, on the 12 December 2012.  Legacy  Flag of Sudan (1956‚Äì1970) Al-Tagtaga was a well-known figure, and was easily recognisable as she often wore a tobe (similar to a sari) in the colours green, yellow and blue, which were the colours of the old Sudan flag. The flag was used from 1956 to 1970, but had a recent surge in popularity on social media in the 2019 revolution, with popular feeling wanting a new and more representative flag for the country. Al-Tagtaga's mixture of political song and protest has inspired new generations of women in Sudan, recently the civil rights campaigner Alaa Salah recited poetry in the front of a crowd of protesters in Sudan. This is a new chapter in a long tradition of Sudanese women singing poems of praise and lament in order to boost moral, honour the dead or to defy rulers. Today, many women in Sudan see Al-Tagtaga as a feminist icon in their country. There are more women \\"Hawa's Babes\\" following her lead and performing traditional song and dance on television.

The album became a financial success, lasting on the Billboard Top 200 charts for more than three years.. The album consists of a live recording of one of Warren‚Äôs performances at the Golden Falcon from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Dealing with themes of women's infidelity, sex work, and sexual freedom from a woman's perspective, Knockers Up! is notable for its forward-thinking concepts that would later become popular in the Sexual Revolution, with Warren herself later being called \\"The Mother of the Sexual Revolution\\".  Background  After Warren‚Äôs first album, Songs for Sinners, was successfully released in January 1959, she went on a tour with her record producer Jerry Blaine, co-founder of Jubilee Records. Afterward, Warren and Blaine started working on promoting her second album Knockers Up!.  Musical content  Knockers Up! is a comedy album that deals with themes of sex, with various songs exploring themes and jokes that weren‚Äôt typical of female comedians at the time. Describing her record as always being ‚Äúa shared experience‚Äù, that meant to be played in a room with friends, the comedic aspect of the album consists of Warren poking fun at traditional concepts of marriage and gender roles, noting the stress of married life and the loss of sexual freedom. The title track encourages women to express their sexuality, with Warren stating ‚Äúwe do have something to give‚Äù in regards to sexual topics in society.  Reception   Commercial performance  The album was a commercial success. By the end of 1962, 1.5 million copies were sold, and it remained in top ten on the album charts for a year. Billboard 1963 edition listed Knockers Up! as one of the nation‚Äôs #1 comedy albums. The album debuted at no. 31 on November 7, 1960. Knockers Up! was the No. 6 album of the year.  Critical reception  Knockers Up! and Warren received a mixed reception as a whole. American columnist Dick Kleiner reflected on Warren's work by stating ‚ÄúHer material isn‚Äôt really blue - you might call it baby blue - it isn‚Äôt abnormal or sick,‚Äù while a negative review of Warren herself for Time magazine in 1963 stated that Warren and her audience ‚Äúall seem at home in a barn.‚Äù Warren mentioned that she received the most support from the women audience and the \\"Knockers Up Club Members.\\" They would come to see Warren's shows with their families and neighbors.  Legacy/influence  Rusty Warren, as well as her album Knockers Up!, was known for leading the charge in the sexual revolution at the time. She is well known for her comedy and her musical numbers. Warren had a way of normalizing sexual topics like the intimate relationship of a married couple. She also exposed the new suburban way of life and its‚Äô secrets. She left many people surprised and stunned by her style of comedy. Warren was groundbreaking in the fields of women's comedy and sexualized comedy. She used tactics like discussing certain situations in a brutally honest or sarcastic way to make her jokes. She would even call out the audience. When people heard her on stage use vulgar language with ease it left a lasting impression, paving the way for more adult comedy. She grew an impressive fan club mainly sprouting from the Knockers Up! March song. The fan club was a diverse group of people, 70,000 strong. Warren later reflected on the creation of the Knockers Up! march: > I was telling the gals to 'get your knockers up' and let's show the guys we > have something to give in this world today. She started playing march encouraging women in the audience to lift their chests up as a sign of their power.

It was produced in the Syro- Egyptian zone, under the Mamluk dynasty by the coppersmith Muhammad ibn al- Zayn. This object is now in the Islamic Arts department of the Louvre under inventory number LP 16. Despite its common name, it has no connection with the King of France Louis IX, known as Saint Louis (1226 - 1270). It was used as a baptismal font for future French Kings, making it an important Islamic and French historical object. The origins and original purpose of the basin are not fully known, since the first record of the object was in a French church inventory. It was possibly used as a ritual washing bowl at the Mamluk court or it could have been commissioned by a Christian patron. The Baptist√®re de Saint Louis has a complicated visual program on the interior and exterior, depicting a number of different groups of people, a wide variety of animals, fish, plants, and Arabic inscriptions. The basin was made through an engraving and hammering process using precious and high quality metal. Due to the ambiguous history of the basin, the meaning of the iconography, the exact date and location of its creation, and sponsorship is still being debated by scholars.  History  The conditions of commissioning and production of the object are still unknown, as is the date and context of its arrival in France. It does not appear on the inventory of goods Charles V erected before 1380, but it is mentioned around 1440 in an unpublished inventory of the treasure of the Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes. On September 14, 1606, it was used for the baptism of the future king Louis XIII. The Baptistery can be traced several times to the 18th century: first in an inventory of the sacristy of the Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes of 1739 and in the article \\"Vincennes\\" in Description of Paris by Jean-Aimar Piganiol of La Force, in 1742, in which he explains that the baptistery was located for some time at the B√¢tme des Enfans de France and served at the baptism of Dauphin who later went on to reign as Louis XIII. He then goes on to describe the Persian or Chinese figures throughout the basin as well as the variety of animals represented throughout the inner frieze. General view of the Baptistery of Saint Louis, engraving published in the National Antiquities of Aubin-Louis Milin, 1791 In 1791, Aubin-Louis Milin, in National Antiquities, seems to be the first to make the link between the Baptistery and Saint Louis The same author recognizes many Western characters; he believes that the four horsemen present in the medallions outside indicate the years of conflict between the sultans and the Franks. Milin also raises the possibility of an earlier arrival in France, linked to the Embassy of Harun al-Rashid to Charlemagne at the beginning of the 10th century. The work also presents rather imprecise engravings, but which show that the object has not undergone major modification since that time, with the exception of the addition of two plates to the arms of France in 1821, a date in which the object is used to baptise the Duke of Bordeaux.Milin 1791, p. 62. On 17 January 1793, the Baptistery was sent to the deposit of Petits-Augustins before entering the museum nine days later.Makariou 2012b, p. 282. Replaced in 1818 at Vincennes, by order of the king, it returned to the Louvre in 1852, after a decree of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte stating that \\"all objects that belonged to the rulers who ruled France would be sought, gathered and placed in the Palace of the Louvre.\\"Rice 1951, p. 10. It left the museum temporarily in 1856 to serve in Notre Dame at the baptismal ceremony of Prince Napoleon Eugene; this is the last time this basin was used as a baptismal object. The year 1866 is marked by two publications: in the Catalog of the Museum of Sovereigns Henry Barbet de Jouy describes the subjects of the basin and their depiction of a Saracen prince fighting, hunting, and feasting, as well as the different animals, some predators and some prey. Barbet de Jouy calls into question the dating proposed before and puts forward the hypothesis of a work reported in France around 1150. For its part, Adrien Pr√©vost de Longp√©rier proposes in an articleLongp√©rier 1866. the first scientific study of the Baptistery. He discovered the origin of the false date of Piganiol, refutes the idea that the work served at the baptism of St. Louis, and sees a work of the first half of the 13th century, because of fleur-de-lys which seem to have been added in the 13th or 14th century in Europe. In 1930, a stylistic analysis by Mehmet Aga Oglu is the first to recognize the baptistry as a work of Syrian workshop, and the date of the first quarter of the 14th century.Aga-Oglu 1930. Nine years later, at the time of the German invasion, the basin was made safe in the Chambord castle by conservationists John David-Weill and David Storm Rice, who was then in Paris to study.Makariou 2012, p. 7 World War II delayed the release of his monograph, which remains today the most comprehensive and best illustrative reference.Rice 1951. His interpretations have, however, been partly questioned by several researchers since then.  Description  The Baptistery of St. Louis is a large basin with streamlined profile, made of a single sheet of brass. According to publications, its dimensions vary slightly: * its height is between 22 cm and 24.4 cmRIce 1951, p.12. ; * its maximum diameter varies between 50.2 cmAtil 1981. p. 76. and 50.4 cm ; * D.S. Rice also gives an indication of the minimum diameter: 38.4 cm. It has decoration depicting human figures both internally and externally, which is characterized by a great diversity of characters, in their clothing, their physical appearance and their postures. According to D.S. Rice, this decoration would be oriented along an axis passing through the silver under the rim of the basin and a characteristic armor. All the figurative motifs are located on a background of plant foliage, where various animals are located. Outside, the decoration occupies the lower part of the basin; it consists of a main register with friezes of characters interrupted by four medallions, bordered by two friezes of running animals, interrupted by four medallions bearing a fleur-de-lys heraldry. Above the upper register, a vegetal pattern ends with lancets. A large inscription in silver takes place on the area remained untouched. A running animal frieze is also present on the edge of the rim. Inside, the decor unfolds in the upper part in the form of a large register decorated with horsemen, interrupted by four medallions: two with a throne scene, two with arms. On either side of this main register unfurl animal friezes interrupted by fleur-de-lys medallions. On the rim, there is also a frieze marked by a wavy pattern, where stylized birds appear. At the bottom of this decoration, a vegetal pattern ends with lancets. The bottom of the basin is also decorated, on the periphery, with a frieze of lancets, and inside a multitude of aquatic animals. Organization of the main friezes of the Baptistery. The outer frieze A rider in medallion A The outer frieze includes twenty characters on foot, and four horsemen in the medallions. All are haloed. The riders all are in action, wearing a costume and have a different physical appearance. On the other hand, their horses are all harnessed in the same way: a net, a saddle with stirrups, a cover more or less long on the rump, a martingale and ornate buttocks. A scarf with a tassel is tied on the nape of the neck. Their tail is sometimes tied (medallion B and D) and sometimes left free. * Medallion A: The rider is a hunter who kills a bear with a spear. He wears a chinstrap hat, a long-sleeved and tight coat. A scarf or cape flies behind him. His face is elongated, smooth, with a protruding chin marked by a point. * Medallion B: The rider is turbaned and wears a short-sleeved coat and a polo cane. The face is missing. A bird with a pointed beak and a long neck forming a loop - perhaps a stork - takes place on his back. * Medallion C: the rider is a hunter, who thrusts his spear into the open mouth of a serpentine dragon with a knotted body. The man wears a hat, a short-sleeved coat and a cape closed on the chest and fluttering on his back. His elongated face is bearded. * Medallion D: the rider seems to wear a headdress tied behind his skull and surmounted by a pompom. His features are reminiscent of the conventions of Iranian representations: a very round face, a mustache and a goatee. His garment, decorated with geometric patterns, is largely missing, but had to be a long-sleeved coat. His saddle is decorated with a bird. The man is an archer: he carries a quiver filled with four arrows and has just unhooked a fifth in the shoulder of a lion. The characters on foot, in the same way, are distinguished by the diversity of their postures, their clothing, and their accessories. * Band E1: Five characters, wearing a cloak attached to the chest, hair tied in a bun and a tripartite jugular hat, except for the central figure, who seems bareheaded. All bear beards, some long and some short. Two have arms crossed in the back, one at the left end, seems attached to a stake which we see the base in the ground, between his feet. The second from the left holds an inscribed cup and a long neck bottle. The central figure carries a quadruped in his arms. The character on the far right holds a written cup; his hat is adorned with a feather. * Band E2: Six characters, three turned to the left, three to the right, the central figure looks to the left. Among the characters turned to the right, one is smaller than the others. He carries a polo cane, wears a coat and boots, and seems pushed by a man leaning behind him. The five tall figures are turbaned, hair falling freely and ears free; they wear a sword at the waist, as well as boots sometimes marked by symbols: a dot, two dots and a drop, two dots around a vertical line, and three vertical lines. Their round faces, marked by a mustache and a goatee, sometimes by a monobrow and picking on the cheeks, could be Mongolian. Two carry an ax to the half-moon blade, another a bow on the shoulders. * Band E3: Four characters, dressed in a similar way to those of the band E1: a cape closed on the chest, a tripartite hat (whose end is flattened, unlike those of the band E1), and low shoes. Three appear to have a stubble;L'expression est emprunt√©e √† Ward 1999, p. 117 the fourth has a long beard. The third character from the left is wearing a different cap that Rice interpreted as being having bird feathers.Rice 1950, p. 20. The leftmost figure has his arms behind his back, the second holds a cheetah's leash, the third wears a hawk on his gloved hand. The rightmost character holds a crane in his right hand and a dog in his left hand; his hat is adorned with a feather, and he seems to raise his head to observe a duck. * Band E4: Like those in the E2 headband, the five characters in the E4 headband wear long coats, boots marked with symbols (a shield with a round emblem, two dots, two dots and a drop) and swords. However, their hairstyles are different: three have headbands tied behind the head, another, a kind of turban, the last a hat similar to those of the band E3. All have knotted hair and are heading to the left. On the right, one wears a napkin decorated with five-petalled flowers and peonies on the left arm, and holds with the other hand a large bag he carries on his back; he wears the mustache and a goatee, a dot on the cheek, and a hat with three feathers. In front of him, a man with a long beard turns his head; he's holding a club. In front, another, whose beard is shorter, carries a bow and arrows. At the left end, two characters carrying a goatee, a mustache and a monobrow, are arranged one next to the other; one, standing, holding a sword, and marked with an indecipherable inscription. He presses his hand on the back of the other, who kneels while seeming to put his elbow on the ground.Anne F. Broadbridge, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2008, 232 p., p. 37 Unlike other characters, the one who kneels does not wear boots. The cannon of faces is thinner than that of the characters of the band E2.  The inner frieze  The medallions of the inner frieze work in pairs. Medallions I and III each have in their center a shield left blank until 1821, and then covered with a coat of armsThe engravings of the work of A. L. Milin show that the shields were not decorated. D. S. Rice had already been able to ascertain this condition by removing one of the silver plates bearing the French coat of arms Rice 1950, p. 375. With the construction of the collections, which took place during the rehabilitation of the Department of Islamic Arts (2009-2012), a plaque was definitively removed. and surrounded by plant motifs where five five-petalled flowers inlaid with gold can be seen. A frieze of plant motif encircles the whole. Medallions II and IV present a similar throne scene: a person, wearing a tripartite crown and an inscribed cup, sits at the eastern on a striped throne, inscribed on the upper part and supported by two lions with gold necklace; on either side of the throne stands a standing man who holds, for the one on the left, a written writing-board, and for the one on the right, a sword. These standing figures are dressed in a long mantle, and probably received a headdress in the form of a band, disappeared; on their boots are symbols: two dots and a drop. One of them (medallion II, on the left, bears a mustache, a goatee and dots on the face); the others are hairless. The face of one of the sovereigns (Medallion II) has disappeared; the other (medallion IV) also has a mustache and goatee, as well as a monobrow. Between the medallions, four sets of three riders take place: two hunting scenes (I1, I4) and two war scenes (I2, I3). In all cases, the harness of the horses takes again that of the horsemen of the external medallions. * On band I1, the two side hunters are turbaned, while the center one wears a headband. The first, whose boots are decorated with two dots and a drop, kills a feline with his spear while above him, a hawk attacks a duck. The one in the center strikes a bear with his sword above him. The last, whose saddle is adorned with a bird, makes a hawk rest on his gloved hand. * The band I2 shows three warriors, the two on the left wearing the turban, and the one on the right wearing a hat. The central figure, who, on his boots, carries a vertical line and two points, seems to be attacked by the two others. He shoots an arrow at the left-wing figure, who attacks him with a spear, but is struck by the sword of the character on the right, with two-pointed boots and a drop, which also holds a stick in his other hand.The steel stick (gaddh√¢ra) is a powerful weapon of the Mamluks, able to cut the hand of an opponent. It was banned in 1512. Mayer 1952, p. 47. On the ground, cut limbs (an arm, a hand, a head with a pompom hat) testify to the violence of the scene. * In the center of the band I3 a figure entirely covered with a slat armor, the head protected by a shield that only lets see his eyes and topped with a hat, shoots an arrow at a character in front of him, the sword raised wearing a simple coat, a headband surrounding his head. At the back, a third rider seems neutral: he also wears a hat, holds a spear in his left hand and brings his right hand to his chest. *The band I4 shows a lion hunt by three turbaned riders. On the left, the hunter draws his bow in the direction of a lion who bites the chest of his horse; that of the center attacks with the sword the animal which springs before his horse, forced to turn his head; in the rear, the last brandishes a sickle-shaped weapon against the lion perched on the rump of his steed.

These blazons were modified at an unknown date and replaced a fleur de lis, which could make one think that it was a French rectification; however, D.S. Rice believes that this is an Oriental-style fleur de lis, used both in the Ayyubid dynasty and in the Qal√¢'√ªn house. He also identified the two pieces of furniture originally found on the coats of arms: a lion crawling to the right (present on half of the outer faces) and an element consisting of a circle surmounted by a stem with two rectangles. D. S. Rice speaks of a tamga, that is to say, an identity symbol used since ancient times by the Turk-Mongols. Rice picks up there an identification of L.A. Mayer, but the form knows no equivalent and its owner could not be identified; E. Knauer proposes to see a tamga specially created for Berke, son of Baybars, but without bringing any element allowed to go beyond the stage of the hypothesis. Sophie Makariou prefers to see a key, which links to a coat of arms to a four-keyed cross on the lintel of the monastery of Nicolas-des-Chats in Akrotiri (Cyprus). The lion also poses a problem by its form, since it is never represented as stalking, but always passing, in Islamic heraldry. This challenged his identification as the emblem of the sovereign Baybars; S. Makariou interprets this as the coat of arms of the Lusignan family. * Other heraldic elements are present on the object: besides the two scutiformes elements, left virgins until 1821, the boots of the dignitaries carry emblems that could be identified. In the coat of arms there is a fess worn by the characters of the E1 banner Emir Salar's emblem, of whom Rice wanted to acknowledge. However, this attribution is opposed. Other items on the boots have not been identified. It may be wondered whether this is heraldry, or simply insignificant clothing details. The vertical line that is present on some boots, which is also represented on furusiyya manuals, would be a stitch as opposed to an element of blazon.  Flora and fauna  * Animal motifs are widely present in the Baptistery of St. Louis and take several forms. *Animal elements which are present in the narrative scenes, whether or not they participate in the narrative, consist of a complex composition at the bottom of the pond, with fish and other aquatic animals.Round of fish at the bottom of the Baptistery of Saint Louis * Apart from the round of fish, most of the animals belong to the world of hunting. Some animals are prey such as gazelles, ibex, hares, wild boars, lions, bears, foxes, wolves, cheetahs, ducks, and waders, while others are helpers like tame cheetahs, dogs, and hawks. There are other various animals such as dromedaries, elephants, and horses. Also present are imaginary creatures such as griffins, sphinxes, unicorns, and dragons. *The round of fish are specifically organized: in the center, six poisons form a radiant pattern around a point. Five concentric circles of fish surround them. However, the general impression is that of a disorder, because between the circles of fish, the artist slipped a varied and disorganized aquatic fauna: ducks, eels, crabs, frogs, a crocodile, a pelican, and two harpies * The entire decoration, with the exception of the ornament of the edge of the basin, is on a background of interlaced vegetation. In the animal friezes, foliage is organized in cylindrical windings. In the principal registers, the vegetable ornament seems more free-flowing, with the aim of filling every space. The foliage is accentuated by small palm leaves and palmettes divided into three parts. Leaves, possibly derived from the vine leaf pattern, are present in the interior medallions with escutcheons, as well as five-petalled petals inlaid with gold. On the main registers, there are also large plant stems bearing rows of leaves, with flowers present at the end of the stems. There is also a vegetable with a large flower and another indistinct vegetable which is composed of two palms intersecting they lay between the legs of the characters of the headband. *Detail of the frieze.  Manufacturing: technical and work organization  The technique of making this object consists of inlaid metalwork which is still practiced in Cairo to this day.Fran√ßoise Docquiert, Vincent Manniez, Le Baptist√®re de Saint-Louis, Eclectic Production, 2006. The artist first develops the desired pattern by hammering the brass and then polishing it. Subsequently, he creates the next layer of decorative metal by dividing the surface of the basin into divisions, then drawing the figures and foliage. The artist cuts the patterns out of precious metal and prepares it to be hammered into the brass. The artist then begins working hammers the precious materials, silver and gold, into the copper, and then engraves the details. The final step is coating the bowl with bituminous black material, which enhances the engravings, highlights the contours, and creates contrasts.Rice 1951, p. 12. This technique appears in Islamic lands in the 12th century, probably in eastern Iran, before spreading quickly to the Syrian world.Ward 1993, p. 71. The Ayyubid dynasty, especially the artists of the \\"School of Mosul,\\" some of whom worked in Damascus brought this technique to a zenith.L'Orient de Saladin, l'art des Ayyoubides, Paris, Institut du monde arabe/Gallimard, 2001, p. 127. The Mamluks, who came to power in 1250, adopted this tradition amd produced works of great luxury in the Bahrite period (1250-1382). Despite its generally stable state of conservation, the Saint Louis Baptistery has lost part of its inlay, either because of the wear of time (which is probably the case for the fish that were covered by water) or by vandals who stole the precious metal. This phenomenon of theft and loss took place mainly at the end of the 14th century, when the precious metals were scarce.Ward 1993, p. 108. However, the majority of the basin's inlays are complete. The organization of work in the workshops remains difficult to understand because of a lack of written sources. Although coppersmiths appear to sign their work more so than other artisans, they were still considered to be artisans of secondary status, unlikely to attract the attention of their contemporary scholars.Mayer 1959, p. 14. The Baptistery bears the signature of one person named Muhammad ibn al-Zayn, who also put his name on a smaller bowl in the Louvre.Bol aux personnages sign√© Muhammad ibn al-Zayn, Paris, mus√©e du Louvre, MAO 331 LA Mayer emphasizes that some works with two signatures show that there is usually at least one artist doing the foundational work of shaping the bowl, and another, the Naqqash, was the main decorative inlayer.Mayer 1959, p. 12. When a name is inlaid in silver letters, it usually means that this person was the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù and inserter. One such name is Muhammad ibn al-Zayn, Al mu'allim.Makariou 2012, p. 15. The use of the term al-mu'allim is found in other pieces of Mamluk inlaid metals such as a piece of furniture in the name of an-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qala'un kept at the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo,Meuble m√©tallique au nom d'an-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qala'un, sign√© ibn al-mu'allim al-ustadh Muhammad ibn Sunqur al-Baghdadi al-Sinayi, √âgypte, 1327-1328, Le Caire, mus√©e d'art islamique, MIA 319. cf. Makariou 2012, p. 37, fig. 15. or a mirror preserved at the Topkapi Museum.Miroir sign√© al-Mu'allim Muhammad al-Waziri, Syrie, premi√®res d√©cennies du xive si√®cle, Istanbul, mus√©e de Topkapi. M.

Form and style  Basin in the name of Hugues de Lusignan, Paris, Louvre Museum, MAO 101 Basins with flared edges had existed since the Ayyubid period: for example, the Arenberg Basin, dated around 1247-1249 and preserved at the Freer Gallery of Art,Bassin d'Arenberg, Washington, Freer Gallery of Art, F 1955.10 [archive]. or the basin in the name of Salih Najm ad-Din Ayyub preserved in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo.Bassin au nom du sultan Salih Najm ad-Din Ayyub, Syrie ou √âgypte, 1239-1249, Le Caire, mus√©e d'art islamique, inv. 15043. cf. L'Orient de Saladin, p. 144, n¬∞ 119. However, these basins often have a fairly smooth and curved transition zone. With its strongly streamlined profile, angularity, as well as its remarkable dimensions, the Baptistery of Saint Louis moves away from this type. It belongs to a group of basins of similar shape and size,Ward 1999, p. 119-120 ; Makariou 2012, p. 9. 50 of which two bear the name of Sultan An-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qala'un,Bassin au nom d'an-Nasir Muhammad, Syrie, 1320-1341, Londres, British Museum, 1851,0104.1 [archive] : cf. Atƒ±l 1981, p. 89-91 ; Bassin au nom d'an-Nasir Muhammad, Saint Louis Museum, 50:1927 [archive]. one is dedicated to a Sultan of YemenBasin d'ablution du Sultan al-Mujahid Sayf ad-Din 'Ali, √âgypte ou Syrie, v. 1321-1363, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 91.1.589 [archive]. and another was made to Hugh IV of Lusignan.Bassin au nom d'Hugues de Lusignan, Syrie, 1324-1359, Paris, mus√©e du Louvre, MAO 101 [archive]. There is another basin also very close in form and decoration, but is unfinished probably because of a technical accident (a crack in the background) and is kept at the LA Mayer Memorial in Jerusalem, and was attributed to Muhammad ibn al-Zayn by Jonathan M. Bloom.Bloom 1987 The general style of the basin is a continuation of previous works. The friezes of animals is an element that predates Islam.Baer 1998, p. 36. All the frieze animals are traditional species in the arts of middle east: all are found, for example, in the copies of Ibn Bakhtishu's Manafi al-Hayawan. In particular, the unicorn chasing the elephant is a recurrent theme of Islamic art, which echoes legends reported by al-Jahiz and al-Qazwini in particular; it is found on lustrous tiles in the thirteenth century in Iran and on bas-reliefs in Konya during the same period.Richard Ettinghausen, , Washington, 1950, p. 28-30, pl. 18-19. In the same way, the association between the griffin and the sphinx is well established at the time of the creation of the Baptistery.Eva Baer, , Jerusalem, tie israel oriental society, 1965, p. 24-25. Only the serpentine dragon could have been a novelty tbat arrived in Egypt with the Mongol invasion; however, they are found in the Syrian zone from the Seljuk period. Rounds of fish including other animals become a motif according to E. Baer at the beginning of the fourteenth century, as shown by an Iranian brass inlaid metal bowl, dated around 1305.Naples, mus√©e national, H. 3253. cf. Baer 1998, p. 104-107. For her, these motifs \\"evoke - it seems - dreams about distant seas and foreign whose waters bring wealth and good fortune. \\" Several elements would indicate a certain sense of humor on the part of the artist, such as the absurd inscription on the flat, or the presence of a small rabbit represented from the front, for short, which seems to look directly at the viewer. Rider on a Syrian candlestick from the thirteenth century, Paris, Louvre Museum, OA 6035 In the same way, decorative foliage parallels older works. The spiral motif is predominant in Egypt: it is found for example on ivories and Fatimid woodwork.Plaques de rev√™tement, √âgypte, [archive]xiie si√®cle, Berlin, Museum f√ºr islamische Kunst, I 6375. In Ayyubid metals, as on the Basin of Sultan al-'Adil II signed by al-Dhaki,Bassin du sultan al-'Adil II, Syrie, Damas ?, 1238-1240, Paris, mus√©e du Louvre, OA 5991 [archive]. the foliage - as well as the calligraphy of the signature - are very similar to those on the Baptistery. The tall-stemmed flowers bearing rows of leaves fare parallel to Baghdad's painting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, such as the Pseudo-Galian's Book of Antidotes, which dates to 1199.Paris, BNF, arabe 2964. There are no new motifs in the Baptistery that are not found in other works. Brought by the Mongol invasions, the group of metalworks (except those of LA Mayer) have a large number of peony flowers in particular. The only peonies of the Baptistery are present on a napkin worn by a character, which could demonstrate his Mongol origin. The five-petalled florets surrounding the blazons in the internal medallions find immediate parallels in the medallions of the other basins in the group. But the most unusual missing element on the Baptistery is the absence of a large inscription in Thuluth, characteristic of the art of this period. The other basins of the group, with the exception of that of the L. A. Mayer collection, that are unfinished and undated still have large Thuluth inscriptions. J. M. Bloom as R. Ward and S. Makariou both note this incongruity;Bloom 1987, p. 18 ; Ward 1999, p. 117. R. Ward and S. Makariou argue it could be due to Christian ownership of the Baptistery. However, the basin in the name of Hugh de Lusignan in the Louvre bears a large inscription in Thuluth calligraph.  Interpretations of iconography  The interpretation of the iconography of the Baptistery of St. Louis has been controversial since the nineteenth century. Most researchers, including DS Rice, agree that some of the scenes depicted specific events,Ward 1999, p. 115. while some elements, such as genuflection, have no equivalent in other Islamic art and might be purely decorative. However, Rachel Ward argues against this interpretation by pointing out that Mamluks do not have a tradition of portraiture or 'history painting' in their metal art, and that such representation would be inconceivable without an inscription that identifies the scene. She also believes that looking to date the basin based on the costumes represented is absurd, as Mamluk artists worked more abstractly rather than direct representation. S. Makariou considers R. Ward's hypotheses valid, while other researchers disagree. D. Rice argues, based on the difference in clothing and physical characters of the external friezes, contrasts with the traditional Mamluk costume, that two the basin depicts two distinct groups: panels E1 and E3 depict Turkish emirs and panels E2 and E4 depict Arab servants.Rice 1951, p. 13-19. Among the emirs, one could be Salar because of his coat of arms, but because of some of the figures around him, like the huntsman (fahhad), the cheetah, and the falconer (b√¢zy√¢r) all associated with emirship.Rice 1951, p. 20. The medallions with the scenes of throne might have no particular meaning; on the other hand, there would be narrative continuity between the battle scenes, the severed head being that of the character struck in the previous banner.Rice 1951, p. 26. In 1984 E. Knauer, in an article devoted to the representation of the Mongols in the painting of trecento, proposes that the baptistery was \\"a testimony of the lively exchanges between Berke Khan and Baybars I, which culminate with the circumcision of the son of Baybars on September 3, 1264, in the presence of the representative [of the Golden Horde]. E. Knauer supports his point by looking at the unusual character of the double coat of arms; he identifies the lion-shaped one at Baybars, and evokes the idea that the tamga-shaped one would be that of the young circumcised, Berke. He mostly identifies hats as Mongol hats, and believes that their physical type would be that of the Caucasian emirates.Knauer 1984, p. 117. Doris Behrens-Abouseif, in 1989, questions these assumptions. She insists that the types identified as servants by Rice are sometimes associated with aristocratic privilege. For her, each rider in the medallions represents an aspect of the furusiyya, an equestrian art highly valued in the Mamluk period; the entire Baptistery would be an evocation of tournaments (mayd√¢n) taking place during ceremonies at the time of Sultan Baybars.Behrens-Abouseif 1988-89, p. 5.  Sponsor, dating, and location  These different hypotheses result in academics dating and locating the Baptistery differently. By his identification of Salar as an emissary represented and sponsor of the work, D. S. Rice proposes a date between 1290-1310 .Rice 1951, p. 16-17. A stylistic comparison with a bowl kept in the Berlin museum and made for Emir Sumul, companion of Salar, allows him to support his hypothesis. He speculates that the lion's coat of arms could be that of Baybars II70.Rice 1951, p. 27. As for localization, the presence of a crocodile, a nilotic animal, makes it look like an Egyptian work.Rice 1951, p. 26. E. Knauer and D. Behrens-Abouseif, identify the scenes as related to the life of Baybars I, argue for an older dating in the third quarter of the thirteenth century. After having questioned Rice's dating because of the costume, Behrens-Abouseif puts forward several arguments to this effect: the costumes of the non-Mongol emirs are archaic; the strange absence of musicians Baybars hated; the importance of Mongolian traits, to be linked with the influx of Mongol refugees in Cairo under Baybars;Celles de porte-coupe (saqi), de ma√Ætre de la garde-robe (jamd√¢r) et de ma√Ætre de la chasse (am√Ær shik√¢r) sont cr√©√©es par Baybars ; celle de secr√©taire (daw√¢dar) acquiert une nouvelle importance). the highlighting of charges put in place and renovated by the Baybars reforms; the importance given to the lion in iconography. For her, the work is therefore an order of Sultan Baybars.Behrens-Aboouseif 1988-89. On the contrary, R. Ward believes that the Baptistery is an early example of Venetian-Saracenic metal, made in Syria for a European sponsor in the mid-fourteenth century. The quality of the metal does not necessarily mean it was created for the local rulers. According to her; on the contrary, the absence of monumental inscriptions to the titles of a major character shows that this is a work done for a foreign sponsor because it would be labelled if it was meant for local nobility. In the same way, the signatures and the annexed inscriptions would be only a decorative tool, because they would not have been appreciated by a sponsor unable to read Arabic. The shield shape that was kept free of metal and the use of the rampant lion flag (the Lusignans symbol) indicates a European sponsor since there were no comparable Islamic symbols. The dating proposed between 1325 and 1360 is based essentially on the gradual approximation of the age of Baptistery within the group of basins already mentioned, and with a corresponding group of manuscripts made in Damascus between 1334 and 1360. This comparison, the fact that Damascus was recognized in Europe as a center of metal (sensitive in the words \\"damasquinure\\" and \\"damass√©\\") whereas Cairo was closed to foreigners, supports the theory that the manufacturer was in Damascus. This hypothesis could be reinforced by the existence, in Damascus, of an iron gate dated 1340‚Äì59, which contains the name Muhammad ibn al-Zayn;M. H. Burgoyne, , Londres, 1987, p. 368-379. however, the identification of the author of the Baptistery with that of the grates of Damascus remains questionable, because it would then be a unique example of an unusual artist who worked both iron and brass metal inlay works.Ward 1999. S. Makariou argues this hypotheses and proposes that the lion's coat of arms belong to Hugh IV of Lusignan.Makariou 2012, p. 18.  References   Bibliography  *** Mehmet Aga Oglu, ¬´ ¬ª, Pantheon, vol.

The group believes that feminism and gender are political and social issues affecting freedom and development in all societies. The group provides support in relation to gender-based violence and discrimination as well as gender equality and women's presence in the public sphere. Nazra has a particular focus on youth groups seeking support for gender-related causes. Women Human Rights Defenders (WHRDs) working in Nazra face strong traditional and patriarchal structures which make campaigning against gender violence and inequality very difficult. The group has documented many cases of violations against women in which members of the police and medical personnel engaged in victim-blaming or caused further discrimination or harm when the original rights violations were reported.  Founder  The group was founded by Egyptian feminist activist Mozn Hassan in Cairo in December 2007. Having received the Charlotte Bunch Award for her work on Women's Human Rights in 2013, a travel ban order was imposed on her in 2016, which prevented her from leaving Egypt. She has received the Right Livelihood Award, known as the Alternative Nobel Prize, for her work on women's human rights and is a board member of the Global Fund for Women.  Interrogation  In March 2018, the assets of the group and of Mozn Hassan were frozen by the Egyptian government at Cairo Elementary Court, in a case referred to in the Egyptian media as the \\"foreign funding\\" case 173/2011. This asset freeze was unprecedented, with Nazra being the only NGO targeted and some staff received a summons for interrogation. Volunteers work on behalf of the group, despite the lack of a stable office space. The Nazra worker's case is part of a wider movement of human rights groups who are making public their fear of a #aShutteredPublicSphere.

She won Drawing Now Prize in 2014. She obtained many residencies abroad and exhibited at key galleries and museums, including MAMCO Geneva in 2009.  Life  Cathryn Boch was born in Strasbourg in 1968. She graduated from University of Strasbourg in 1990, receiving General Academic Studies Degree (D.E.U.G.) in History of Art. Later she received National Diploma of Plastic Art Studies (1994) and National Superior Diploma of Plastic Expression (1996) from Graduate School of Decorative Arts of Strasbourg. In 2002-2003 Boch also completed Visual Art training (C.F.P.I) at Graduate School of Decorative Arts of Strasbourg. In 2014 she won Drawing Now Prize. Between 1995 and 2001 Boch was one of four artists known as the group ‚ÄúLes Pisseuses‚Äù who chalked exquisite corpses on the walls of Strasbourg.  Art  Boch uses road maps, aerial views, topographic surveys and entire iconography of locating, measing and recording the territory as a raw material for her artworks. As a painter she mixes the colors on her palette to get the desired tone, like a sculptor she takes pieces of the material to give the substance a form. She calls the job she is doing ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù: she works with the paper, touching it, sanding, scraping and piercing, until the drawing is revealed in layers. Manipulating maps with hand sewing, she creates sculptural topography. The tension of the threads hardens the folds and paper turns into sculpture, reinforced with a frosting of sugar or varnish. Tension of the material is used as a metaphor of world's tension shaken by migratory crisis, rise of extremes, wars and global warming. For Boch, born in Alsace border region of parents from both countries, geographical borders in her works is a paradoxical space, both marginal and central, a space of closure and encounter. Boch's work was featured in numerous exhibitions at key galleries and museums, including the Galerie Christian Berst, Paris and the Galerie S√©bastien Bertrand, Rue de l'Ev√™ch√© among others. Her works are in public collections of Frac Picardie and PACA, Municipal Fund of the City of Paris (FMAC) and the Georges Pompidou Center, as well as in several renowned private collections.

The optimum growth temperature for T. permanentifrigoris is 25-30 ¬∞C, and can grow in the 5-37 ¬∞C range and in pH 5.5-8.9. The bacterium would not grow in liquid broth media, but formed yellow colonies on agar.

It disintegrated in midair en route from Montreal to London, at an altitude of 31,000 feet (9,400 m) over the Atlantic Ocean, as a result of the explosion from a bomb planted by Canadian Sikh terrorists. The remnants of the airliner fell into the ocean approximately 120 miles (190 km) west-southwest of the southwest tip of Ireland, killing all aboard: 329 people, including 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens and 24 Indian citizens. () The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the largest mass killing in Canadian history, the deadliest aviation accident in the history of Air India and was the deadliest act of aviation terrorism until the 11 September attacks in 2001.  Pan Am Flight 103  Pan Am Flight 103 was a regularly scheduled Pan Am transatlantic flight from Frankfurt to Detroit via London and New York. On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew in what became known as the Lockerbie bombing. Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto a residential street in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 11 people on the ground. With a total of 270 people killed, it is the deadliest terror attack in the history of the United Kingdom. = 1990s =  Air France Flight 8969  Air France Flight 8969 was an Air France Airbus A300 that was hijacked on 24 December 1994 by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA) at Houari Boumediene Airport, Algiers, Algeria during the Algerian Civil War. The terrorists murdered three passengers and their intention was to blow up the plane over the Eiffel Tower in Paris. When the aircraft reached Marseille, the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN), a counter-terror unit of the French National Gendarmerie, stormed the plane and killed all four hijackers.Taylor (2008) = 2000s =  9/11 attacks   American Airlines Flight 11  American Airlines Flight 11 was a domestic passenger flight that was hijacked by five al-Qaeda members on September 11, 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks. Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing all 92 people aboard and an unknown number in the building's impact zone. The aircraft involved, a Boeing 767-223ER, registration was flying American Airlines' daily scheduled morning transcontinental service from Logan International Airport in Boston to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles.  United Airlines Flight 175  United Airlines Flight 175 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Logan International Airport, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Los Angeles International Airport, in Los Angeles, California. On September 11, 2001, the Boeing 767‚Äì200 operating the route was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists and was deliberately crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing all 65 people aboard and an unconfirmed number in the building's impact zone. Approximately 30 minutes into the flight, the hijackers forcibly breached the cockpit and overpowered the pilot and first officer, allowing lead hijacker and trained pilot Marwan al-Shehhi to take over the controls. Unlike Flight 11, which turned its transponder off, the aircraft's transponder was visible on New York Center's radar, and the aircraft deviated from the assigned flight path for four minutes before air traffic controllers noticed these changes at 08:51 EDT. They made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the cockpit. Unknown to the hijackers, several passengers and crew aboard made phone calls from the plane to family members and provided information about the hijackers and injuries suffered by passengers and crew.  American Airlines Flight 77  American Airlines Flight 77 was a scheduled American Airlines domestic transcontinental passenger flight from Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. The Boeing 757‚Äì223 aircraft serving the flight was hijacked by five Saudi men affiliated with al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks. They deliberately crashed the plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building. Less than 35 minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking. The hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas that August. The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the Pentagon Memorial adjacent to the crash site. The park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth, ranging from 1930 to 1998.  United Airlines Flight 93  United Airlines Flight 93 was a domestic scheduled passenger flight that was hijacked by four al-Qaeda terrorists on board, as part of the September 11 attacks. It crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people on board were killed, including the four hijackers, but no one on the ground was injured. The aircraft involved, a Boeing 757‚Äì222, was flying United Airlines' daily scheduled morning flight from Newark International Airport in New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport in California. The hijackers stormed the aircraft's cockpit 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. Ziad Jarrah, who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, considered principal instigators of the attacks, have claimed that the intended target was the U.S. Capitol Building.\\"'We Have Some Planes'\\". 9/11 Commission Report. National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. 2004. Retrieved October 1, 2013.  2004 Russian aircraft bombings   Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353  The first to crash was Volga-AviaExpress Flight 1353, a Tu-134 aircraft, registered RA-65080, which had been in service since 1977. The plane was flying from Moscow to Volgograd. It left Domodedovo International Airport at 22:30 on 24 August 2004. Communication with the plane was lost at 22:56 while it was flying over Tula Oblast, 180 km south-east of Moscow. The remains of the aircraft were found on the ground several hours later. Thirty-four passengers and 9 crew members were on board the plane. All of them died in the crash. The flight recorders were recovered from the crash site. The flight data recorder showed that the plane was cruising uneventfully at 8100 metres, before indicating some type of high energy event likely originating near the right hand side of the aircraft at seat row 19. Both recorders stopped recording within 2‚Äì3 seconds of this event. This was followed by the separation of the fuselage at that location an undetermined amount of time afterward.  Siberia Airlines Flight 1047  Just minutes after the first crash, Siberia Airlines Flight 1047, which had left Domodedovo International Airport at 21:35 on 24 August 2004, disappeared from the radar screens and crashed. The Tu-154 aircraft, registered RA-85556, which had been in service since 1982, was flying from Moscow to Sochi. According to an unnamed government source of the Russian news agency Interfax, the plane had broadcast a hijack warning while flying over Rostov Oblast at 22:59. However, it was later determined that this was the aircraft's Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), and that the crew of flight 1047 were not aware of any danger prior to the aircraft disappearing from radar. The plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after that and crashed. 38 passengers and 8 crew members were on board the plane, and there were no survivors after the crash. The debris of the aircraft was found on the morning of 25 August 2004, 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) from the work settlement of Gluboky in Kamensky District of Rostov Oblast.[citation needed] The flight recorders were also recovered in this case; the flight data recorder along with wreckage analysis suggested an almost identical high-energy event to the one seen on flight 1353 took place near the right hand side of the aircraft at seat row 25, while the aircraft was cruising at 12100 metres. The blast resulted in a rapid decompression of the cabin, damage to the elevator and rudder controls, a substantial loss of electrical power, and severe damage to the fuselage and tail components. The ELT was triggered a half second after the event, either by a crew member or automatically. The data recorder stopped working shortly after the explosion, but the cockpit voice recorder continued recording until impact with the ground, during which most of the crew discussions were about the loss of cabin pressure and electrical systems. The crew were caught completely off guard by the event, and there is no evidence that the crew was aware of the detonation of an explosive device on board. The two almost simultaneous crashes caused speculations about terrorism. President Vladimir Putin immediately ordered the Federal Security Service (FSB) to investigate the crashes. On 28 August 2004, the FSB had found traces of the explosive RDX in the remains of both planes. Itar-Tass news agency reported on 30 August 2004, \\"without a shadow of a doubt, the FSB security service said that \\"both airplanes were blown up as a result of a terrorist attack\\". A little known group called the Islambouli Brigades claimed responsibility; the truth of those claims remains uncertain. = 2010s =  Metrojet Flight 9268  Metrojet Flight 9268 was an Airbus A321 that took off from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, Egypt, to Pulkovo Airport in Saint Petersburg, Russia. About 23 minutes after takeoff at 6:13 EST (4:13 UTC), a bomb exploded in the aircraft, causing it to disintegrate in mid-air. All 217 passengers and 7 crew members died. On November 16, 2015, investigators found out that a bomb was placed on the aircraft. This accident has been attributed to terrorist bombing and is currently under criminal investigation.  Daallo Airlines Flight 159  On 2 February 2016, 20 minutes after taking off from Mogadishu, Somalia, at 11:00 local time, en route to Djibouti City, at an altitude of about 14,000 ft (4,300 m), an explosion occurred aboard the aircraft, opening a hole in the fuselage behind the R2 door. It was reported that day that the explosion was most likely close to seats 15/16F, abeam the forward wing root and the fuel tanks. There were 74 passengers and 7 crew on board at the time of the incident. The bomber was killed by the blast, which was determined to have come from a rigged laptop. The aircraft was evacuated safely, and the bomber was the only fatality. Two passengers suffered injuries of unspecified degree, but survived.

The regiment was part of the Italian army's infantry and was last operationally assigned to the Infantry Division \\"Folgore\\". The regiment was an atypical unit of the Italian Army: formed without a sister regiment from partisan formations it was the only infantry regiment to be formed by the army after World War II and was the only unit, whose members wore a red tie with their formal uniform.  History  On 25 April 1945 the Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" was formed in Viterbo with repatriated survivors of the Italian Partisan Division \\"Garibaldi\\", which had been formed on 2 December 1943 in Montenegro from the remnants of two Italian divisions, which had refused to surrender to German forces after Italy had switched sides with the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943.  Partisan Division \\"Garibaldi\\"  2nd Yugoslav Partisan Corps Commander Peko Dapƒçeviƒá addressing the men of the Mountain Artillery Group \\"Aosta\\" in September 1943 Alpini of the \\"Taurinense\\" in Pljevlja October 1943 The news of the armistice between Italy and the Allies reached the Italian XIV Army Corps in the evening of 8 September 1943 and due to the lack of any orders from Rome the four divisions of the corps reacted differently and individually to German demands to surrender: the 23rd Infantry Division \\"Ferrara\\" surrendered immediately. The 155th Infantry Division \\"Emilia\\" based around Kotor resisted the Germans until 16 September, but under heavy Luftwaffe air attacks chose evacuation by the Italian Regia Marina to Bari. The 19th Infantry Division \\"Venezia\\" based around Podgorica refused to surrender and allied with Yugoslav partisans. On 10 October the division entered the 2nd Corps of Tito's National Liberation Army and on 13 October 1943 the division began an offensive against Wehrmacht forces in Brodarevo, Murina, Berane e Kola≈°in. The 1st Alpine Division \\"Taurinense\\" based around Nik≈°iƒá and Danilovgrad immediately attacked German positions and by sunrise of 9 September was fully engaged in combat with German forces. The division tried to reach Kotor to be evacuated, but in heavy combat lost about half its strength of 14,000 men. The division's Mountain Artillery Group \\"Aosta\\" of the 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment and Alpini Battalion \\"Ivrea\\" had ignored orders to move to Kotor and sided with Tito's forces right away. By early October the remnants of the Italian divisions, more than 20,000 men, retreated towards Pljevlja. On 2 December 1943 in Pljevlja the remaining Italian soldiers, approximately 16,000 men, were grouped together in the Partisan Division \\"Garibaldi\\", which as unit insignia chose a red neckerchief in referral to Giuseppe Garibaldi's redshirt volunteers. The division consisted of three brigades of 5,000 men each, with the remaining Italians, mostly artillery, signals, engineer, and medical specialists, becoming instructors. Integrated into the Partisan 2nd Corps the division fought in Yugoslavia until February 1945, when the remaining 3,800 troops were repatriated via the liberated Dubrovnik. The units, which entered the Partisan Division \\"Garibaldi\\" as coherent units, were awarded with Italy's highest military honor after their return: * Mountain Artillery Group \\"Aosta\\" 50px Gold Medal of Military Valour awarded on 13 January 1945 * 83rd Infantry Regiment \\"Venezia\\" 50px Gold Medal of Military Valour awarded on 15 March 1950 * 84th Infantry Regiment \\"Venezia\\" 50px Gold Medal of Military Valour awarded on 15 March 1950 * 19th Field Artillery Regiment \\"Venezia\\" 50px Gold Medal of Military Valour awarded on 15 March 1950 * Alpini Battalion \\"Ivrea\\" 50px Silver Medal of Military Valour awarded on 31 December 1947  Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\"  On 25 April 1945 the Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" was formed in Viterbo with the survivors of the Division \\"Garibaldi\\". The regiment consisted of three battalions: * Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" ** I Battalion \\"Aosta\\" (Alpini) ** II Battalion \\"Venezia\\" (Infantry) ** III Battalion \\"Torino\\" (Alpini) The Garibaldi regiment's troops wore the distinct Cappello Alpino of the Alpini infantry specialty. On 5 September 1945 the regiment joined the Combat Group \\"Folgore\\", which had participated on the allied side in the Italian Campaign. The Folgore had been formed on 25 September 1944 with troops from the 184th Paratroopers Division \\"Nembo\\", which had served with the Polish II Corps at the battles of Filottrano, Castelfidardo, and Ancona. The Combat Group \\"Folgore\\" consisted of two regiments with three battalions each: the Paratroopers Regiment \\"Nembo\\" and the navy's Regiment \\"San Marco\\". The 183rd had been formed with the remnants of the six paratrooper battalions of the 184th Paratroopers Division \\"Nembo\\". The combat group also fielded the Paratroopers Artillery Regiment \\"Folgore\\". The same day the Garibaldi regiment entered the division the San Marco regiment left it and reverted to the navy. 15 October 1945 the Combat Group \\"Folgore\\" was elevated to Infantry Division \\"Folgore\\".  182nd Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\"  On 1 December 1948 the Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" was renamed 182nd Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\", the Paratroopers Infantry Regiment \\"Nembo\\" was renamed 183rd Infantry Regiment \\"Nembo\\", and the Paratroopers Artillery Regiment \\"Folgore\\" was renamed 184th Artillery Regiment. With the renaming the 182nd Garibaldi ceded its Alpini troops to the Alpini regiments that were forming and received infantry fusiliers instead. At the same time the regiment ceased to wear the Cappello Alpino and began to wear a red tie with the formal uniform. The regiment's new structure was: * 182nd Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" ** Command Company ** I Infantry Battalion ** II Infantry Battalion ** III Infantry Battalion ** Mortar Company ** Anti-tank Company In 1949 the regiment moved to Sacile and on 12 October 1953 the regiment was awarded Italy's highest military honor the Gold Medal of Military Valour for its service during World War II in Yugoslavia.  182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\"  During 1958 the regiment disbanded its infantry battalions and received the I Bersaglieri Battalion and III Tank Battalion from the 1st Bersaglieri Regiment. On 1 November 1958 the regiment was officially renamed 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" and the III Tank Battalion was renamed II Tank Battalion. The II Tank Battalion was renamed XXI Tank Battalion in 1959, and in 1961 XIII Tank Battalion. The same year the I Bersaglieri Battalion was renamed XXIII Bersaglieri Battalion, and in 1964 XI Bersaglieri Battalion. From 1969 onward regiment's structure was: * 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\", in Sacile ** Command and Services Company, in Sacile (includes an anti-tank guided missile platoon) ** XI Bersaglieri Battalion, in Sacile (M113 armored personnel carriers) ** XIII Tank Battalion, in Sacile (M47 Patton tanks) With the arrival of the XI Bersaglieri Battalion the three Silver Medals of Military Valour awarded during World War I to the battalion's predecessor unit, the XI Cyclists Battalion of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment, were temporarily affixed to the flag of the 182nd regiment and added to the regiment's coat of arms.  11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\"  Coat of arms of the 11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\" with the temporarily assigned Gold Medal of Military Valour of the 182nd Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" With the 1975 army reform the regimental level was abolished and battalions became independent units. The 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" was the last infantry regiment to disband on 15 July 1976 and the next day its XI Bersaglieri Battalion became the 11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\", while its XIII Tank Battalion became the 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pascucci\\". The war flag and traditions of the 182nd Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" were assigned to the 11th Caprera, while the name of the regiment was transferred to the 8th Mechanized Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\". The 11th Bersaglieri Battalion was named for the island of Caprera, where Giuseppe Garibaldi had spent the last years of his life. The battalion inherited the right to wear a red tie, moved from Sacile to Orcenico Superiore and joined the 8th Mechanized Brigade \\"Garibaldi\\", while the 13th Pascucci moved to Cordenons and joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Brescia\\". The Gold Medal of Military Valour awarded to the 182nd Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" remained on the flag the 11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\" inherited, and therefore the medal was temporarily assigned to the 11th Caprera, which added it to its coat of arms. For its conduct and work after the 1976 Friuli earthquake the battalion was awarded a Bronze Medal of Army Valour, which was affixed to the battalion's war flag and added to the battalion's coat of arms. On 30 September 1992 the 27th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Jamiano\\" in Aviano was reformed as 11th Bersaglieri Regiment. On 21 October of the same year the 27th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Jamiano\\" in Aviano disbanded and 11th Bersaglieri Regiment headquarters moved to Orcenico Superiore, where it took command of the troops of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment \\"Caprera\\", which was renamed on that day 27th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Jamiano\\". In parallel the headquarters of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment \\"Caprera\\" moved to Bari and joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Pinerolo\\" as core of the to-be-formed 7th Bersaglieri Regiment. As the 10th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Bezzecca\\", who had been assigned the flag of the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment in 1975, had entered the 6th Bersaglieri Regiment, the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment received its original flag and therefore the flag of the 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\", which had been the flag of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment \\"Caprera\\", was transferred to the Shrine of the Flags in the Vittoriano in Rome. On 18 April 1997 the 27th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Jamiano\\" of the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment was renamed 11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\" and with this all the traditions of and all the awards bestowed on the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment and its battalions were reunited in one unit. Consequently, the three Silver Medals of Military Valour awarded to the XI Cyclists Battalion, which were affixed on the flag of the 182nd Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" were transferred from the 182nd's flag to the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment's flag. With the entry of the 11th Bersaglieri Battalion \\"Caprera\\" the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment gained the right to wear a red tie.  Regimental particularities  11th Bersaglieri Regiment war flag at the 66th National Rally of the Bersaglieri The 182nd regiment was a unique unit with many particularities shared with no other unit of the Italian Army. Italian infantry regiments have always been raised in pairs with consecutive numbers and sharing the same name, however as there never was a 181st Infantry Regiment, the 182nd Infantry Regiment is the only solitary infantry regiment of the Italian Army. The 182nd Regiment was also the only regiment named after a person. All Italian infantry regiments received unique gorget patches they shared only with their sister regiment, with the 182nd being the only infantry regiment, which never received them: from its founding until 1 December 1948 the regiment wore the gorget patches of the Alpini corps, and after 1 December 1948 the gorget patches of the 183rd Infantry Regiment \\"Nembo\\" and 184th Infantry Regiment \\"Nembo\\". After it was reformed as armored infantry regiment the members of the regiment wore the gorget patches of the Bersaglieri and tank specialities.

His style of drawing and painting is characterized by ornate, colorful, intimidating figures which he likened to \\"characters from Dallas\\".  Life  Henry Speller was born the eldest son of Rosie Edwards and Robert Speller. Henry was raised by his maternal grandparents, Ike and Zannie Simpson, in the Panther Burn settlement of Rolling Fork, Mississippi. They were a sharecropping family, mostly on cotton fields, and Henry attended school until he was twelve years old. He then began full-time farm labor to support his grandmother after his grandfather was forced to flee Panther Burn after an altercation with a white employer, who threatened his life. Eventually the whole family moved to northern Mississippi, but Speller dreamed of going North along the Great Migration. Speller married three times in his life. In the 1930s he married Elnora Davis, only to separate shortly thereafter.Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2002. Between 1939 and 1941, he married Mary Lee Shorter, who was from Memphis, Tennessee.Ancestry.com. 1940 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, US: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2012. Seeing an opportunity to move even a little further north, Speller and Mary moved to Memphis in 1941. Together, he and Mary had five children before their divorce. In Memphis, he worked a succession of day- labor jobs, and by night played blues at venues on the neighboring, historic Beale Street. Speller was an accomplished blues musician who played with Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. When Howlin' Wolf moved to Chicago, he urged Speller to join him and become a part of his permanent ensemble, but Speller declined, saying Chicago was too cold for him. He retired from working as a grounds keeper for the Memphis city parks commission in the mid-1960s. A few years before his retirement, Speller met Georgia Verges, a fellow artist. They married in 1964 and had a \\"near perfect marriage\\", according to Speller's son William. They had no children together. Georgia was also a painter whose subjects were often undulating figures engaged in multi-person orgies set on colorful landscapes. She became very ill in the mid-1980s and stopped creating work a few years before her death in 1988. Speller's art and health declined soon after her death. He began to lose his sight in 1990, and therefore the will and ability to make art. He died in 1997.  Career  Henry Speller began drawing and painting when he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1941. He also collected used, discarded materials to fix, re-appropriate, or sell while he worked for the Memphis sanitation department.  Materials  Throughout his career, Speller maintained a preference for large format paper for his drawings, typically . He outlined his subjects in graphite pencil, then filled in the figures and block patterns with crayons or colored pencils. All of his works fill the page to the edges, except his renderings of single figures, which stand alone against a white background. Speller made thousands of drawings in his life-time. Despite his many moves across Memphis, hundreds of his drawings have survived.  Subjects  Speller is best known for his drawings of detailed houses, modes of transportation (trains, cars, riverboats, and planes), and adorned figures, particularly women. His figures are often white women with angular faces, round breasts made of concentric circles, and exposed genitals with common southern Caucasian names, like \\"Katie Mae\\" and \\"Lisa Jean\\". Through these characters, Speller creates a metaphor for mobility and freedom in the Jim Crow South, which white women, and even some black women, can attain, but are inaccessible to him. Patterns play a crucial role in Speller's composition. Stripes and grids function as movement from one plane to another, such as from clothes to skin or from inside to outside of a building. Art historians have drawn a connection between Speller's patterns and African American quilt-making traditions, with their improvised rectangular and square grids. Slipping daily between unending manual labor and the solace of blues nightclubs brought forth the contrasts in Speller's work. His visual style, and those that mimic it, has become known as \\"blues aesthetic.\\" Blues music influences this visual aesthetic by creating fantasy from pain observed first-hand. \\"This theme in turn fits within the realm of the grotesque and the abject, depicting a shifting, wavy body that threatens to exceed containment.\\"  Exhibitions  Speller's work has been featured in the following exhibitions: * Black American Folk Art: Henry Speller, Mose Tolliver, Bill Traylor. 1983, Haupert Union Building, Moravian College, Bethlehem, PA. * Southern Folk Images: David Butler, Henry Speller, Bill Traylor. 1984, University of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA. * Baking in the Sun: Visionary Images from the South: selections from the collection of Sylvia and Warren Lowe.

It is the first long (44 pages) story of the series and the first appearance of the T.I.A. secret agency.  Publication history  The comic strip was first published in the Gran Pulgarcito magazine, issues #1 (January 27, 1969) to 23 (June 30, 1969). It was republished in issue 1 of the Ases del Humor the same year.(11/2005). El mundo de Mortadelo y Filem√≥n. Palma de Mallorca: Dolmen Editorial. Colecci√≥n Stoyteller #3. Dep√≥sito Legal: B-41700-2005 . p. 196. Plot Professor Bacterio has created a sulfate intended to eliminates pests from the field. However, the lotion has just the opposite effect: it considerably enlarges the animals, so it represents a serious danger to humanity. Worst of all, a bottle of the sulfate was stolen by agents of the Republic of Tirania. There rules the dictator Bruteztrausen, who wants to dominate the world. Mort & Phil must go to Tirania and recover it. Analysis This album is drawn more carefully than the rest of the comics of the characters,Barroco brugueresco in El Pa√≠s as they wanted to make it more similar to the French bandes dessin√©es. In later adventures Ib√°√±ez decided that most readers would not notice or care of that extra details, that were too time-consuming and decided not to draw them anymore. The plot is also more linear than other albums, that are divided in chapters.
