Formerly known as \\"Greensboro High School,\\" \\"Greensboro Central High School,\\" and then \\"Greensboro Senior High School,\\" it is part of the Guilford County Schools system. The school has an enrollment of around 1,800 students in grades 9‚Äì12 (the 9th grade was added to GHS in 1986). Grimsley has a reputation for strong academics, having been ranked in the top 100 in the nation by Newsweek 4 out of the past 6 years. The school's colors are navy blue and white, and its teams are known as the \\"Whirlies\\" (originally the \\"Purple Whirlwind\\") depicted with a tornado-like symbol. ==Campus== The school campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. ==History== Established in 1899, Grimsley is the oldest institution of public secondary education in Guilford County and one of the oldest high schools in the state. (Asheville High School, Cary High School, Concord High School, and New Hanover High School in Wilmington are all older.) GHS was founded in 1899 as Greensboro High School; it became Greensboro Central High School in 1911 and Greensboro Senior High School in 1929 (when it moved to its current campus, after previously having had two locations in downtown Greensboro). In 1962, against the wishes of the school, it was renamed Grimsley Senior High School in honor of George Adonijah Grimsley, the superintendent of Greensboro's schools (1890‚Äì1902) who fostered the creation of GHS in 1899. Upon its creation in the fall of 1899, Greensboro High School was located on North Forbis Street in the former St. Agnes Catholic Church building, on part of the site of the current Greensboro Public Library, behind the Greensboro Historical Museum. By 1910, this building was outgrown, so for one year (1910‚Äì1911) GHS was moved next door to the Lindsay Street Grammar School. In the fall of 1911, the school moved to the site of today's Weaver Academy, where it became Greensboro Central High School, and where it remained until 1929. In the fall of 1929, GHS moved to its current Westover Terrace location, when it became Greensboro Senior High School. See \\"facilities\\" section below for a description of the current campus. In 1902, Greensboro High School established the first school library and book rental system in the state. 10th grade was also added that year (previously 9th grade was the highest grade). In 1911, after the move to Spring Street, 11th grade was added. In 1934, as part of the New Deal's Civil Works Administration (CWA), two large murals were painted in the GHS auditorium by Raleigh artist James A. McLean: \\"Energy\\" and \\"Education.\\" The school's original colors were purple and gold (circa 1909‚Äì10). Because of increasing difficulty in finding matching shades of purple for athletic and band uniforms, the colors were changed‚Äîby vote of the student body in March 1951‚Äîto navy blue and white. The mascot was originally the \\"Purple Whirlwind,\\" adopted in 1921. Local papers, in an attempt to have variety when referring to GHS's teams (and to save space in headlines) came up with the name \\"Whirlies\\" in 1941. (Other variations of \\"Purple Whirlwinds\\" had been used back to the 1930s.) The name \\"Whirlies\\" caught on quickly and was used interchangeably with \\"Purple Whirlwinds\\" until the color change in 1951, leaving the original mascot name as \\"Whirlwinds.\\" Since the late 1950s, \\"Whirlies\\" has been used almost exclusively. While the whirlwind was the mascot beginning in 1921, in 1956‚Äîand originating as the theme of the Whirligig yearbook that year‚Äîthe Whirlibird mascot appeared, becoming instantly popular. It became the main mascot for the school, lasting until the early 1980s, when the whirlwind re-emerged as GHS's mascot. Grimsley's Alma Mater was composed and written by Herbert Hazelman in the fall of 1949. Mr. Hazelman was the Greensboro Senior High Band Director for 40 years. The music building is now named in his honor. In 1958, Josephine Boyd became the first black student to graduate from Greensboro Senior High School. GHS was the first formerly all-white high school in the state of North Carolina to have an African-American to graduate. On January 16, 1962, Greensboro Senior High School changed its name to Grimsley Senior High School after principal A.P. Routh received a surprise phone call from a Greensboro City Schools official informing the school that the school board was going to change the name of the high school that night, and they had three hours to choose a new name or the school board would choose for them. Routh and the staff chose Grimsley because there was a strong desire to keep the school GHS, and George A. Grimsley was the superintendent of Greensboro City Schools when Greensboro Senior was first established in 1899. The name change took effect on July 1, 1962. Advanced Placement (AP) classes were first offered at Grimsley in 1964. In the fall of 1995, Grimsley became the first school in Guilford County and only the fourth school in North Carolina to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme. On August 20, 2008, then Presidential candidate, and soon to be 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama played basketball with former SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott in the Sawyer Gym. In 2013, Grimsley had the graduation of a fifth-generation GHS student which became statewide news because of its rarity for a public school. ==Academics== The Advanced Placement (AP) program was introduced at Grimsley in 1964 with the introduction of AP European History (1964-2014), followed by AP English in 1968. Today AP classes are offered at GHS in 19 different subjects. In 1995, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program was instituted at Grimsley, after two years of preparation by the school under Principal Tom Penland. Grimsley was only the fourth high school in North Carolina, and the first outside Charlotte, to offer the IB program. Aside from the AP and IB programs, a College Preparatory program and a careers program that includes a Health Careers track are offered. The school participates in academic competitions such as High IQ, Science Olympiad, robotics, and FIRST. Grimsley has above average national passing rates for nearly every AP test offered at the school. Leading the way is Calculus BC, which sometimes has a passing rate of 100%, taught by Roberta Rohan '82 who was honored with the Siemens Award for Advanced Placement in 2010. She was one of 50 teachers nationwide and the only teacher from North Carolina to receive the award. ==Facilities== The Westover Terrace GHS campus, which opened in 1929, is unusual in that it is made up of multiple buildings (a conscious decision of the school board in the late 1920s), rather than just one all-encompassing building. The Main Building, Old Science Building, and Cafeteria Building‚Äîthree of six originally proposed structures‚Äîwere built in 1929. The cost of living had risen so much in the late 1920s that the other three could not be built at that time; the onset of the Great Depression‚Äîsoon after the new campus opened‚Äîfurther delayed expansion of the campus. As of 2015, Grimsley's campus has 11 separate buildings, consisting of the Main building (1929), which has offices and classrooms on the first floor, classrooms on the second and third floors, and the 1500+ seat John Barnes Chance-M. Thomas Cousins Auditorium. The Old Science Building (1929) has two stories of classrooms. Immediately behind it is the one-story New Science building (1975). There is a two-story Home Economics Building (1956). The one-story Library Building (1967/expanded 2003) has two classrooms as well as the GHS library. The Old Cafeteria Building (1929) has classrooms on the first and second floor currently. Before 2014, the cafeteria building housed the school lunch room. The two-story Herbert R. Hazelman Music Building (1956, named 2004) contains the band, orchestra, and choir rooms, plus numerous practice rooms and two classrooms. The Vocational Building (1942) has two stories of classrooms. Plans were complete in 2011 for a new Cafeteria Building (authorized by a bond vote in 2008), to be constructed behind and between the Home Economics and New Science buildings. The New Cafeteria building was complete by the beginning of the 2013‚Äì2014 school year. Across the service road, \\"Campus Drive,\\" from the academic buildings are GHS's athletic facilities. The Robert R. Sawyer '55 Gym (1954, originally the \\"Boys' Gym,\\" then the \\"Main Gym\\", named in 2000) was the largest high school gym in North Carolina when built, and was architecturally significant because it had the largest unsupported concrete beams ever built in an American building when it was new. The Auxiliary Gym (1939, originally the \\"Girls' Gym\\") has a basketball court, a weight-training facility, and a classroom. Connected to the Sawyer Gym is the John Gordon Dewey '71 Memorial Swimming Pool, which opened in 1976 but became defunct in December 2011 after a large storm uprooted part of the roof. Behind the Sawyer Gym and Dewey Pool are eight tennis courts (1975), a practice field, and the Softball Field (1980s). Across Campus Drive are the other athletic facilities, the Robert B. Jamieson Football Stadium (1949, named in 1975), which included a track (1958‚Äì2012) and the Sigmund Selig Pearl Memorial Field House (1950), and beyond the football stadium, the Willie Young/Lewis McCall Memorial Baseball Field (1953, named in 1974 and 2007), and the Cross Country trail (1962). The 2008 bond referendum, besides authorizing a new cafeteria for Grimsley, also includes money for a major overhaul of both the Sawyer Gym and Jamieson Stadium, as well as the construction of a new track stadium and a new softball field. The original wooden covered walkways connecting the various campus buildings were built in the 1930s, and most were replaced (although a few of the originals remain) with two-story brick covered walkways built in 2002‚Äì03 (as originally planned in 1929), when the campus was made ADA compliant (and air conditioned), funded by money approved in a bond referendum in 2000. It has been said that the use of hard clay in the set up of walkways in 2002-03 created the infamous \\"Lake Grimsley\\" in the front lawn. Lake Grimsley (as students call it) is a large area of standing water that forms when it rains heavily or for a long period of time. The Grove (developed in 1963), a large outdoor social area between the Main and Music buildings is a popular spot for eating lunch and hanging out, although the 2012-13 school year was the final year students were allowed to eat lunch in the grove (with the exception of the rare occasion of a combined lunch), due to the opening of the New Cafeteria. Originally the majority of the Grove was covered with gravel, but it was paved with cement in late 1973. Besides the paved areas, there also is an area with a mulch ground covering, and several large trees which provide shade for many picnic tables. ==Clubs== Many of these clubs are started and run by the students themselves. While student-created clubs result in many different clubs that represent a wide area of activities, often these clubs disintegrate after the founder or president leaves. ==Athletics== Grimsley is a 4-A school with a strong athletic program, including sports teams in football, basketball, baseball, tennis, swimming & diving, golf, wrestling, cross country, track & field (both winter and spring), soccer, softball, volleyball, field hockey, and lacrosse. GHS has won more athletic team state championships than any other high school in North Carolina‚Äîthe first being in football in 1907‚Äîas well as many individual state championships. Grimsley has won the NCHSAA 4-A Wachovia Cup (for the most outstanding 4-A athletic program in North Carolina) five times: 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1990. Grimsley has also been undefeated in men's swimming in dual meets for over a quarter century. An athletic \\"boosters program,\\" alumni, and the annual Grimsley-Page football game generate much of the funding for the sports programs at GHS. Grimsley's Robert B. Jamieson Football Stadium (with a 1/4-mile track until it was removed in 2012) was the largest high school football stadium in North Carolina when it was completed in 1949. Today, it is also the site of soccer and lacrosse games in addition to football. It is home to many local events, including fundraisers, special Olympics, the annual North Carolina Coaches' Association's East-West All-Star Game (the first such game, in 1949, was the first game played in the stadium), and the annual fireworks display for the city on Independence Day until 2010, when it was moved to the newly opened White Oak amphitheater. Construction of a new outdoor track was completed in the Spring of 2012. The school has two gymnasiums. The larger Robert R. Sawyer '55 (formerly Boys'/Main) Gym provides facilities for most indoor sports such as basketball, wrestling, and volleyball, while the smaller Auxiliary (formerly Girls') Gym has a basketball court, a weight room, and a classroom. As with Jamieson Stadium, the Sawyer Gym was the largest high school gym in the state when it opened. From 1976-2015, attached to the Sawyer Gymnasium was the building containing the John Dewey '71 Memorial Pool, which was permanently closed in December 2011 and torn down in August 2015, after it was determined that structural issues and damage was too extensive to save the building. GHS's tennis courts (1974) are located behind the Sawyer Gym, as is a practice field, and the GHS softball field. The Willie Young-Lewis McCall Baseball Field (1953) is located behind the Jamieson Stadium. The GHS cross country trail (1962) is in the woods behind Kiser Middle School and the football stadium and baseball field. Historic sports rivalries for GHS over the years have included: Reidsville High School in the 1920s and '30s, High Point Central High School in the late '30s through the early '50s, R. J. Reynolds High School, in Winston-Salem from the mid-'50s to the mid-'60s, and Walter Hines Page Senior High School in Greensboro since the mid-1960s. This rivalry is celebrated every year with a spirit week before the football game, which usually attracts crowds of close to 10,000, the capacity of Jamieson Stadium. The most significant Grimsley-Page football game occurred on November 20, 1987, when Grimsley beat the undefeated and top ranked team in the state at the time (15th in the nation), Page Pirates 10-7 in the state 4-A playoffs, Grimsley's first win over Page since 1971 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUYhJscPi7Q). Prior to this game, the average score of a Grimsley-Page game in the 1980s was 44-4\\\\. Jamieson Stadium served as the venue for the game every year until 2015, when the game was moved to Page High School's Marion Kirby Stadium. On November 8, 2019, Grimsley defeated Page by a score of 32-17 at Marion Kirby Stadium, Grimsley's first win over Page since 2006, winning the Metro 4A Conference Title and a #1 overall seed in the NCHSAA 4A State Tournament. ==Principals== { style=\\"font-size: smaller; margin-left: 1em;\\" -  *Samuel C.

Essentially, this is a screen that lights up whenever a charged particle passes through it. Electron source and beamline installation Cut-away view of the RF photo- injector gun that produces the electron bunch to be injected in the plasma wakefields The AWAKE (Advanced WAKEfield Experiment) facility at CERN is a proof-of-principle experiment, which investigates wakefield plasma acceleration using a proton bunch as a driver, a world-wide first. It aims to accelerate a low-energy witness bunch of electrons from 15-20 MeV to several GeV over a short distance (10m) by creating a high acceleration gradient of several GV/m. Particle accelerators currently in use, like CERN's LHC, use standard or superconductive RF-cavities for acceleration, but they are limited to an acceleration gradient in the order of 100 MV/m. Circular accelerator machines are not efficient for transporting electrons at high energy due to the large energy loss in synchrotron radiation. Linear accelerators do not have this issue and are therefore better suited for accelerating and transporting electrons at high energies. AWAKE's high acceleration gradient will allow the construction of a new generation of shorter and less expensive high energy accelerators, representing a big step in the particle accelerators technology, especially for linear electron accelerators. == Proton bunch- driven plasma wakefield acceleration == Simulation of the interaction between the bunches of protons (red dots) and the plasma wakefield (blue waves) A plasma consists of positively charged ions and negatively charged free electrons, while remaining macroscopically neutral. If a strong electric field is applied, ions and electrons can be spatially separated. A local electric field is thereby created, thus a charged particle entering a such plasma can be accelerated. When the driver, the positively charged proton bunch, penetrates the plasma, it attracts the negatively charged plasma electrons, they overshoot and start to oscillate, creating a wakefield. The interaction between the wakefield and a charged particle injected behind the proton can be interpreted as the same as the one between a surfer and a wave. The latter will transfer its energy to the surfer who will thus be accelerated. The wakefield consists of decelerating and accelerating phase, as well as focusing and defocusing phase. The injection position of the electron bunch in the wakefield is thus crucial, since only a fraction (1/4th) of the wakefield is both focused and accelerated, which is needed for the trapping and the acceleration of the electrons. AWAKE is the first plasma wakefield experiment using a bunch of protons as a driver. Protons, as e.g. the protons form the CERN SPS, can carry a large amount of energy (~ 400 GeV). Therefore, they can produce wakefields in a plasma for much longer distances than a laser pulse or electron bunch as a driver due to energy depletion. A plasma can be seen as an ensemble of oscillators with a frequency of the plasma frequency œâp2=4nee2/Œµme, with ne the plasma electron density, me the electron mass and e the elementary charge. To excite those oscillators resonantly, the driver must contain a Fourier component close to the plasma frequency œâp. Moreover, the length of the drive bunch should be close to the plasma wavelength Œªp (=2œÄc/œâp with c is the speed of light). For AWAKE like density (ne ‚âà 1‚Ä¢1015 cm‚àí3) this corresponds to approximately Œªp ‚âà 1 mm. The length of currently available proton bunches though exceeds this value significantly. AWAKE profits form the seeded self-modulation (SSM) of the proton bunch travelling through the plasma, which divides the long proton bunch into shorts micro-bunches with the length of the plasma wavelength that can drive the wakefield resonantly. == The AWAKE facility == The AWAKE experiment is installed at CERN, in the former CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS) facility. This site was selected for its underground location, and it was specifically designed for the use of high- energy proton beams without any significant radiation issue. The proton bunches for AWAKE are extracted from the CERN SPS and are transported through an ~800-meter beam-line to the 10-meter long vapor source of AWAKE. The electron witness bunches are injected behind the proton bunch. To detect acceleration of the injected electrons, a dipole magnet is installed after the vapor, bending their path. The larger the electron's energy, the smaller curvature of its path. A scintillation screen then detects accelerated electrons. The vapor source contains Rubidium (Rb) vapor which is ionized by a Ti:Sapphire laser. The vapor source is surrounded by an oil bath. By setting the temperature of the oil, the Rb vapor density can be set and kept uniform along the vapor source. AWAKE uses a laser pulse to ionize the Rb vapor. By propagating the laser pulse co-linearly within the proton bunch, the hard edge of the beam/plasma interaction seeds the self-modulation of the proton bunch, enforcing the grow over the 10m long plasma It also allows to create a phase reference for the start of the wakefield, which is needed to inject the witness bunch at the right phase for trapping and acceleration. The electrons are produced by sending the laser onto an RF-gun photo-cathode. == Timeline == The first run lasted from 2016 to 2018. The ten metre-long vapor source was installed 11 February 2016 and the first proton beam was sent through the beam-line and the empty vapor source on 16 June 2016. The first data with a proton bunch inside the plasma was acquired in December 2016. On 26 May 2018, AWAKE accelerated an electron beam for the first time. The beam was accelerated from 19 MeV to 2 GeV over a distance of 10 m. A second run is planned for 2021 to 2024. The acceleration gradient will be increased and the emittance is expected to shrink. It is planned to increase the electron energy to 10 GeV. After this phase the goal is to increase the energy to at least 50 GeV and provide beams for first applications.Anthony Hartin: Particle physics applications of the AWAKE acceleration scheme, EPS-HEP2019 ==References External links == * AWAKE's website Category:CERN accelerators Category:CERN experiments Category:Particle physics facilities Category:Underground laboratories ","title":"AWAKE"},{"id":"2208399","text":"First edition (US) Heartbeat is a 2004 children's book by Sharon Creech, published by HarperCollins in the US and Bloomsbury in the UK.

During his early years Hal must work as a casual laborer. His dream is to fly dragons, so he joins a traveling troupe who give rides on dragons as entertainment from town to town. Hal is away from his home country and his king, Asir. When war breaks out, he is drafted into the army as an unwilling soldier. However, he does his best and works his way through the ranks of the army and society with his heroic exploits. Dragons are mainly wild and untamed creatures that are brought into the war, while Hal and others devise new and more damaging ways to use the dragons against their enemies. This tale is told in the first two books, which contain bloody action throughout. The third book covers life after the war, the difficulties ex- soldiers face, and how Hal deals with it.

It had seemed to Bunch and Cole that entirely too many science fiction authors were enamored with monarchies and their consequent fascist (although benevolent) ideals. They wanted to write a series to show the realities of politics and power and to place a working- class man into this series, letting the reader see through his eyes and watch as he grows to be a real and realistic hero. # Sten (1982) () # The Wolf Worlds (1984) () # The Court of a Thousand Suns (1985) () # Fleet of the Damned (1988) () # Revenge of the Damned (1989) () # The Return of the Emperor (1990) () # Vortex (1992) () # Empire's End (1993) () Anteros * The Far Kingdoms (1985) () * The Warrior's Tale (1994) () * Kingdoms of the Night (1995) () Novels * A Reckoning for Kings (1987) () ==See also== * ==NotesInterview at SFFWorld.com * Category:1943 births Category:2005 deaths Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American fantasy writers Category:American male novelists Category:American science fiction writers Category:United States Army personnel Category:Writers from Fresno, California Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:People from Ilwaco, Washington ","title":"Chris Bunch"},{"id":"2208424","text":"Sequah's Prairie Flower ad Sequah Medicine Company began in 1887 as the Sequah Medicine Co Ltd selling patent medicines such as prairie flower and Indian oil using traveling salesman, known as Sequahs. The traveling salesmen were quack doctors. The original Sequah was William Henry Hartley, who sold supposed Native American remedies in Great Britain and Ireland. The successful pitch quickly drew imitators, to the annoyance of Hartley. One such example is Peter Alexander Gordon, who went under the pseudonym James Kaspar. Gordon sold the Sequah Patent Medicine in Great Britain, Ireland, the West Indies and North America and South Africa. Sequah products were sold using the device of a traveling medicine show. These shows consisted of a warm-up act of music and other entertainments which attracted a crowd in order for the traveling salesman to begin his pitch. The British version, introduced in 1890, was made up of a fairground steam organ. The Government soon declared the practice of selling patent medicines in such a fashion illegal. The company went into liquidation in 1895 and was liquidated on March 26, 1909. == References == Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1887 Category:Pharmaceutical companies disestablished in 1909 Category:Patent medicines Category:1887 establishments in England Category:1909 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1909 Category:British companies established in 1887 ","title":"Sequah Medicine Company"},{"id":"2208456","text":"The entrance on Mercer Street. The Coles Sports and Recreation Center was the main athletic facility at New York University, located at 181 Mercer Street in New York City, in the U.S. state of New York. The building was named in honor of Jerome S. Coles, an alumnus and benefactor of NYU. The facilities accommodated a wide range of individual and group recreational sports and fitness activities, including over 130 different courses at various skill levels serving 10,000 participants, as well as club sports and an intramural program enjoyed by approximately 3,500 students. Coles was renovated with a new dehumidifcation system in 1999 to solve problems of corrosion. Up to 3,000 members used the facility daily, while 1,900 spectators could be seated in the fieldhouse bleachers and 230 could be seated in the natatorium bleachers. The Coles Sports Center was barrier-free and accessible to physically challenged persons. Coles was also the home to most of New York University's NCAA Division III intercollegiate teams. Some teams that competed in the facility include: men's and women's basketball, diving, swimming, volleyball, and men's wrestling. The fencing team also used Coles facilities, but participated in NCAA Division I. Club sports housed at Coles Sports and Recreation Center included badminton, cheerleading, martial arts, squash, racquetball, and waterpolo. Coles was closed in February 2016, and will be demolished as part of the NYU 2031 plan. ==Tournament hosting== The Center also has played host to the following events: NCAA Basketball National Championships, NCAA Regional Wrestling Championships, ECAC Regional Basketball Championships, Metropolitan Wrestling Championships, International Wrestling events, International Fencing events, University Athletic Association Championships and National Collegiate Tae Kwon Do Championships. In 1994-95, Coles hosted the Intercollegiate Fencing Association Championships and the UAA Wrestling Championship. In 1998, the UAA Women's Volleyball Round Robin took place at Coles, and the women's basketball team hosted the Sweet Sixteen and the Final Four during the NCAA Division III Women's Basketball Championships. ==Facilities== The following facilities were open to all students: *A multi-purpose arena with five courts. *Two batting cages. *A roof with a 1/6 mile, three-lane running track plus six tennis courts. *A natatorium with an NCAA-regulation 25-meter swimming pool, diving tank, and saunas. *Five squash courts and five handball/racquetball courts. *Weight training facilities. *An aerobic fitness room. *Individual rooms for wrestling/judo, fencing, physical fitness and calisthenics, exercise prescription, dance, and free play activities. *Rock climbing wall. ==References== Category:New York University Category:NYU Violets basketball Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:College swimming venues in the United States Category:College volleyball venues in the United States Category:College wrestling venues in the United States Category:Defunct sports venues in Manhattan Category:Basketball venues in New York City Category:Badminton venues Category:Fencing venues Category:Squash venues in the United States Category:Swimming venues in New York City Category:Volleyball venues in New York City Category:Water polo venues Category:Wrestling venues in New York City Category:University and college student recreation centers in the United States ","title":"Coles Sports and Recreation Center"},{"id":"2208468","text":"is a platform video game developed by Dimps and Sonic Team for the Game Boy Advance in 2004. It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the sequel to Sonic Advance 2. The game stars the characters Sonic, Tails, Amy, Knuckles, and Cream as they seek to keep Doctor Eggman and his robot assistant Gemerl from building empires on each of seven chunks Eggman has divided the Earth into. The game is a fast-paced 2D platformer that takes place across seven zones, each divided into three acts and a boss fight. It allows one or two players to control any two of the five characters; each one has different abilities that allow players varying access to parts of levels. While the graphics are mainly 2D, the game features some 3D rotation effects. It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and aesthetics, though they were more divided on the team-up dynamic. The game was later released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan in May 2016. ==Gameplay== Game screenshot showing Cream the Rabbit and Knuckles the Echidna. Shown clockwise from bottom left, the game's HUD features lives remaining, an icon reminding the player of Knuckles' R-button ability, rings collected, and time elapsed. Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player controls one of five characters simultaneously with a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump through a series of seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. If a character takes damage while carrying no rings, they lose a life. The team will also lose a life if they drown underwater, get crushed by a moving object, fall into a bottomless pit, or exceed an act's ten-minute limit. Losing a life will make the team start over from the beginning of the act or from the last passed checkpoint. If all lives are lost, the player receives a game over.Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, p. 21. The levels contain features like vertical loops, springs, and rails that the player can grind on. Each level is divided into three acts, punctuated by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman at the end; all three acts, the boss fight, and two minigames that grant the player extra lives are bound by a hub world. Within each act, the player collects Chao creatures; finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage, where a Chaos Emerald can be found. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, which can be done after completion of the main campaign, allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game's true ending.Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, p. 23. The player can select any two-member permutation of its five playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Cream the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails are available at the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman over the course of the game. Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air,Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, pp. 8‚Äì9. Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller,Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, pp. 10‚Äì11. Amy can smash enemies with her hammer,Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, pp. 16‚Äì17. Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls,Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, pp. 12‚Äì13. and Cream can fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese.Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, pp. 14‚Äì15. The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button;Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, p. 5. for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air.Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, p. 10. In addition, the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not. Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.Sonic Advance 3 instruction manual, pp. 27‚Äì30. ==Plot== Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman builds a robotic assistantSonic Advance 3 instruction manual, p. 4. named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who was destroyed in Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds. The final boss fight takes place at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple. Peace is restored to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house. ==Development and release== Sonic Advance 3 was published by Sega in Japan and THQ in North America, while both companies co-published the game in Europe. Like Advance 1 and 2, its development was shared by Dimps and Sega subsidiary Sonic Team since the latter was understaffed on employees familiar with the Game Boy Advance hardware. Yuji Naka, then President of Sonic Team, had limited involvement in the development of Sonic Advance 3, and he conceived of the team-up dynamic. While the game is fundamentally 2D, it features some Mode 7 3D rotation effects. THQ announced the game in a press release on September 11, 2003. The game was later exhibited at E3 2004. ==Reception== Sonic Advance 3 received positive reviews from critics, with respective scores of 79% and 80% at review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. It later won Handheld Game of the Year at the 2004 Golden Joystick Awards and sold over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom alone. Critics gave mixed opinions to the team-up dynamic. Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had \\"finally [come] up with a way of introducing teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread- and-butter gameplay.\\" Maragos singled this out as the main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes, a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike Advance 3, was in 3D. Maragos, GameSpot's Frank Provo, IGN's Craig Harris, and Game Informers Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought. However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro, thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took a different point of criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called \\"pointless\\". Maragos noted that the \\"mid-air trick\\" system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3, but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating \\"hidden areas\\". Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional \\"cheapness\\" in the level design, because \\"most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards\\". However, the gameplay was mostly well-received otherwise. Vassar acclaimed the level design: he both called the levels \\"enormous and fast\\" and praised the slower, smaller sections for \\"keeping the levels distinct and adding short interludes to the constant running and loops.\\" Harris also praised the \\"clever\\" level design. However, Mason found it \\"simplistic\\", while Stardingo saw \\"repetition\\" in the typical formula. Maragos criticized the bipolar difficulty of the bosses and some minor control issues. Vassar, however, appreciated the return from Advance 2s running-based boss battles to more traditional ones. Further praise from Harris, conversely, went to the multiplayer mode and‚Äîalong with Stardingo‚Äîto the presence of a hub world, which Harris and Stardingo thought gave the game structure. The game's aesthetics were also well received. Provo stated that \\"in terms of graphics and sound, Sonic Advance 3 is on par with the best that companies like Nintendo and Konami have had to offer this year\\". He specifically complimented the character animations, simulations of underwater waves, and in-depth background effects. Vassar praised Advance 3 for continuing Advance 1 and 2s emulation of the \\"colorful, angular, and stylized look\\" of the original Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis, as well as its \\"twangy, upbeat tunes\\". Stardingo thought similarly overall but criticized the \\"garish\\" themes of the level Toy Kingdom. ==NotesReferencesExternal links== *Official website Category:2004 video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Platform games Category:Sega video games Category:THQ games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Sonic Team games Category:Dimps games Advance 3 Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games produced by Yuji Naka Category:Virtual Console games ","title":"Sonic Advance 3"},{"id":"2208472","text":"A lawn is an area of land planted with grass and sometimes clover and other plants, which are maintained at a low, even height.

It depicts the 1931 √Ödalen shootings, in which Swedish military forces opened fire against labour demonstrators in the Swedish sawmill district of √Ödalen killing five people, including a young girl. The film was X-rated in the United States. It won the Grand Prize of the Jury at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. ==Plot== In 1931, the working-class family Andersson of √Ödalen are taking part in a massive sympathy strike for workers in the town Marma. Harald, the father of the family, catches fish and manages to support his family while maintaining a good mood. Kjell, the oldest son, works at the office of the local sawmill manager, and is taught about classical music, impressionism and French pronunciation by the manager's wife. He plays in a jazz band with his friend Nisse with whom he also discusses things like girls, erogenous zones and hypnosis. As spring commences, the manager's daughter Anna comes home for school holiday. She and Kjell fall in love, and she becomes pregnant with his child. When the sawmill is to deliver a big order to America, strikebreakers are called in from other towns. The local strikers become furious and police has to be called in to protect the strikebreakers. Still they are attacked by an angry crowd while working at the Sandviken wharf outside Kramfors. Some are thrown into the water, while others are beaten bloody. Harald takes care of an injured strikebreaker, but is confronted by a group of angry workers. He tries to argue for them to calm down and rely on discussion instead of violence, but they do not agree with his stance. Because of the turbulence, military troops arrive to ensure safety. It is also decided by the County Administrative Board that the strikebreakers should be prohibited from working, but this information doesn't reach the upset locals, who decide to march to the locality where the strikebreakers are staying to get rid of them. When the military troops fail in persuading the participants to stop, they open fire. Five people are killed and five more are injured. Among the dead are Harald Andersson, Nisse and a young girl who had only been a bystander. Around the same time, Anna returns from Stockholm where she has had an abortion arranged by her mother. When Kjell is told about the abortion by Anna's father, he interprets it as if he isn't accepted within the bourgeois idyll. A general strike is proclaimed. While Kjell is occupied as a strike guard, he meets the man who had previously argued with his father. The man claims that the father wasn't innocent, since he had helped to divide the workers. Not until now they were united. Kjell does not agree, instead claiming that education is the key to a better society. Slowly the Andersson family recover from the loss, and eventually the factories open again. ==Selected cast== *Peter Schildt as Kjell Andersson *Kerstin Tidelius as Karin Andersson *Roland Hedlund as Harald Andersson *Marie De Geer as Anna Bj√∂rklund *Anita Bj√∂rk as Hedvig Bj√∂rklund *Olof Bergstr√∂m as Olof Bj√∂rklund *Jonas Bergstr√∂m as Nisse *Tommy Malmstr√∂m as angry young communist *Olle Bj√∂rling as strikebreaker *Pierre Lindstedt as supervisor *Stefan Feierbach as √Öke Andersson *Martin Widerberg as Martin Andersson ==Critical reception== \\"Beautiful yet uninspired\\" was the assessment of Pauline Kael. \\"Lush and lyrical as it is, it‚Äôs fundamentally didactic, with stereotyped social-realist characters. And because Widerberg seems to work best in vignettes and to have architectural problems when he‚Äôs working on such a large scale, his argument isn‚Äôt clear; he makes the little points but not the big ones. So when the violence erupts, we don‚Äôt really understand its political significance ‚Äì we‚Äôre left 'appreciating' it, in a rather embarrassed way, for its pictorial values.\\" ==Awards and nominations== Widerberg won the award for Best Direction, and actor Roland Hedlund won for Best Actor at the 6th Guldbagge Awards. Internationally, the film won the Special Grand Prize of the Jury at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

He also toured with Down and performed live in support of their debut album, NOLA. == Career == Strange formed Crowbar with Kirk Windstein (Down), Matt Thomas, and Craig Nunenmacher (Black Label Society). They released the best-selling albums of the band's discography, including the self-titled LP with the songs \\"All I Had (I Gave)\\", \\"Existence is Punishment\\", \\"No Quarter\\" (by Led Zeppelin), and \\"I Have Failed\\", produced by Phil Anselmo. By 1994, Anselmo put his band Pantera to the side and resurrected Down which was sidelined for Pantera in the late 1990s. The band released NOLA in reference to the band's hometown, New Orleans, Louisiana, and played 13 shows. Eventually, the album sold 500,000 copies and was certified Gold by the RIAA. Soon after, Anselmo returned to Pantera while Crowbar continued, and the two bands partnered up for tours in 1996. As a result, Strange, Windstein, and the rest of Crowbar appear in Pantera's \\"Home Videos 3\\" in the credits, and Windstein and the band are seen in scenes including the clip of Windstein dressed up as the Hulk. This event is also included in Crowbar's 1996 home video \\"Like Broken\\", but contains slightly different footage. By the time Down reformed and Crowbar recorded \\"Sonic Excess in its Purest Form\\", Strange dropped completely out of music. For several years afterwards, he worked as a machine repair tech in River Ridge, Louisiana. In June 2016, after Crowbar's bassist Jeff Golden was fired from Crowbar, Windstein announced Strange's return to the band. In 2018, Strange took a break from Crowbar to focus on spending more time with his family, though he is still a band member for Crowbar.

John II of Alen√ßon (2 March 1409 - 8 September 1476) was the son of John I of Alen√ßon and his wife Marie of Brittany, Lady of La Guerche (1391‚Äì1446), daughter of John V, Duke of Brittany, and Joan of Navarre. He succeeded his father as Duke of Alen√ßon and Count of Perche as a minor in 1415, after the latter's death at the Battle of Agincourt. He is best known as a general in the Last Phase of the Hundred Years' War and for his role as a comrade-in-arms of Joan of Arc, who called him \\"le beau duc\\" (\\"the fair duke\\"/\\"the gentle duke\\"). ==Biography== He was born at the Ch√¢teau d'Argentan. He first saw action at the age of fifteen at the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424, and was captured by the English. He was held prisoner until 1429 at Le Crotoy, paying 200,000 saluts d'or for his ransom. He sold all he possessed to the English, and his fief of Foug√®res to the Duke of Brittany. After Alen√ßon's capture, the Duke of Bedford, regent of Henry VI, took control of his duchy. He would not regain Alen√ßon until 1449, but remained the titular duke in the eyes of the French crown. When he left prison, Jean d'Alen√ßon was called \\"the poorest man in France\\". Before his capture at Verneuil, he had married in 1424, at the Chateau de Blois, Jeanne of Valois, daughter of Charles, duc d'Orl√©ans, and Isabella of Valois, but she died in Angers in 1432, having given him no children. In April 1429, not long after his release, the Duke heard about Joan of Arc, who had come to Charles VII at Chinon, promising to liberate France from the English, asking that he send her with an army to lift the Siege of Orl√©ans. Alen√ßon came eagerly to Chinon and very quickly became her good friend and most prominent supporter among the princes of the blood. After she raised the siege alongside Jean de Dunois and La Hire among others, Alen√ßon arrived as official commander of the French army and played a major role in the liberation of the rest of the Loire Valley. He left to fight elsewhere after the end of the campaign in September 1429, preferring to attack the English around his own domains in Normandy. Upon Joan's martyrdom on 30 May 1431, when she was burnt at the stake by the English at Rouen, Alen√ßon was one of the people most devastated by the loss. On 30 April 1437, at the Chateau L'Isle-Jourdain, he married Marie of Armagnac (c. 1420 - 25 July 1473, Cloister Mortagne-au-Perche), daughter of Jean IV of Armagnac. John was discontented with the Treaty of Arras, having hoped to make good his poverty through the spoliation of the Burgundians. He fell out with Charles VII, and took part in a revolt in 1439-40, (the Praguerie) but was forgiven, having been a lifelong friend of the king. He took part in the invasion of Normandy in 1449, but he had unwisely entered into correspondence with the English since 1440. (He had also accepted the Order of the Golden Fleece at this time.) Shortly after testifying at the \\"rehabilitation trial\\" of Joan of Arc in 1456, he was arrested by Jean de Dunois and imprisoned at Aigues-Mortes. In 1458, he was convicted of l√®se-majest√© and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted and he was imprisoned at Loches. He was released by Louis XI upon terms at his accession in 1461, but he refused to keep them and was imprisoned again. He was tried a second time before the Parlement of Paris and sentenced to death again on 18 July 1474, and his Duchy was confiscated. However, the sentence was not carried out, and he died in prison in the Louvre in 1476. ==Personal life== He had two children by his second wife, Marie: * Catherine (1452-1505), married 1461, in Tours, (died 1501) * Ren√© of Alen√ßon (1454-1492), who would regain his father's confiscated titles of Duke of Alen√ßon and Count of Perche in 1478 He also had several illegitimate children: * John (living 1483) * Robert (living 1489) * Jeanne (d. aft. 4 December 1481), Countess of Beaumont-le-Roger, married in 1470 Guy de Maulmont * Madeleine, married Henri de Breuil ==AncestorsReferencesSources== * * ==External links== *http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/compgns.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20090321045721/http://futura- dtp.dk/SLAG/Personer/NavneA/AlenconDuc.htm *http://www.maidofheaven.com/joanofarc_alencon.asp Category:1409 births Category:1476 deaths Category:People from Argentan Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:French soldiers Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Alencon Category:Joan of Arc Category:House of Valois-Alen√ßon 102 Category:Counts of Perche Category:15th-century peers of France Category:French prisoners of war in the Hundred Years' War ","title":"John II, Duke of Alen√ßon"},{"id":"2208512","text":"Winckelmann may refer to: * George Winckelmann, a Finnish lawyer and a diplomat * Johann Joachim Winckelmann, a German art historian and archaeologist * Johann Just Winckelmann, a German writer and historian * Maria Margarethe Winckelmann, a German astronomer == See also == * Winkelmann ","title":"Winckelmann (disambiguation)"},{"id":"2208516","text":"Blue Dolphin may refer to: * A shot glass full of water ordered from a bar as a humorous drink order * A glass of water on ice with a straw * A cocktail mixed with Rum, Blue Cura√ßao, Vodka, lemonade, and soda * A cocktail mixed with Vermouth, Blue Cura√ßao, Grenadine, and lemonade * A holiday park in Filey, North Yorkshire * Blue Dolphin Martini, a print by Ralph Burch * A holiday resort in Yamba, Australia * Restaurants, inns and cafes all over the world * A registered trademark of Blue Dolphin Films * One of many different types of Ecstasy (MDMA) pills, commonly a blue pill with a stamped dolphin. * Island of the Blue Dolphins is a children's novel by Scott O'Dell which won the 1960 Newbery Medal * Blue Dolphin Energy Company, an oil and natural gas company * The schooner Blue Dolphin, a yacht and research vessel designed in 1926 by William Roue ","title":"Blue dolphin"},{"id":"2208522","text":"Joseph Henry Nettlefold (19 September 1827 - 22 November 1881) was a British industrialist, the Nettlefold in Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds.

Hers was a family of Birmingham manufacturers and politicians: her brother's son, Joseph Chamberlain (1836-1914), was a radical Liberal and a leading imperialist. They had three sons: Edward John Nettlefold (1820-1878), Joseph Henry Nettlefold (1827-1881) and Frederick Nettlefold (1833-1913). One of Edward John's sons was named after him, John Sutton Nettlefold, who was a social reformer. ==Career== In 1823, he opened a hardware store at 54 High Holborn. This was followed in 1826 by a workshop to make woodscrews based in Sunbury-on-Thames. The Sunbury factory was powered by a waterwheel and Nettlefold saw the importance of motive power when he took advantage of steam power in a new factory in Baskerville Place, off Broad Street, Birmingham. He renamed the business Nettlefold and Sons, Ltd., and it expanded rapidly in London and Birmingham.Smith (2004) In 1854, Nettlefold acquired the opportunity to purchase a licence to manufacture to a U.S. patent for a novel woodscrew. The licence, and the establishment of a new factory, demanded an investment of ¬£ 30,000. Nettlefold sought and obtained the involvement of his brother-in-law as equal partner for an investment of ¬£10,000 and the two established a factory in Smethwick, leaving its management to their sons, Edward John and Joseph Henry Nettlefold, and Joseph Chamberlain.

Along the way the players vanquish hordes of enemy soldiers while attempting to rescue hostages (with large score reductions for any hostages killed in the crossfire), collecting weapons from troopers and operating tanks. ==Releases== Veteran video game cover illustrator Marc Ericksen at his drawing board, in 1993, at 1045 Sansome Street, North Beach, San Francisco, California. The arcade version, released by SNK in 1987, followed the format of Ikari Warriors (1986). Using eight-way rotary joysticks, the game allowed players to move their character in one direction while rotating the joystick in order to shoot in another. The game was moderately successful, and spawned ports onto home video game systems. Data East released home editions on the PC, Commodore 64 and Apple II, while Imagine Software published the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum ports in Europe. SNK published itself a version for the NES/Famicom 8-bit console. Because of the limits of the home platforms, the home versions did not have the rotating joysticks. Both the arcade and home console versions were included on the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The NES version's two-player simultaneous play, unlimited continues, and frantic action gave it an edge over its arcade predecessor. It received a perfect 5-star rating in the book Ultimate Nintendo: Guide to the NES Library 1985‚Äì1995 and is also available on PlayStation Network.

Hershey refers to it as \\"The Great American Chocolate Bar.\\" The Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar was first sold in 1900. ==Hershey's milk chocolate== The Hershey Process milk chocolate in these bars uses fresh milk delivered directly from local farms. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and produced the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, especially in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a company and trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed. This produces butyric acid (a compound found in substances such as parmesan cheese) which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This flavor gives the product a \\"tangy\\" taste that the US public has come to associate with the taste of chocolate, to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates. Outside of the US people are not as accustomed to the taste. In Canada this lead to Hershey introducing a reformulated Canadian bar in 1983. Starting in 2006, Hershey has added polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) to their chocolate, except for the traditional plain milk chocolate Hershey's Kisses. In 2015, Hershey announced they would begin removing PGPR from the rest of their chocolate. Artificial vanillin was also removed in 2015. Hershey did remove PGPR from some of their chocolate bars, but in April 2019 started putting it back in Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds full size bar, and plain milk chocolate bars, and never removed it from Symphony milk chocolate and other products. Hershey does not claim to use vanilla in their chocolate, only natural flavor, which may be the same chemical as the artificial one it replaces, except created from a natural source through several processes. ==Other varieties and details== In addition to the standard Milk Chocolate and Milk Chocolate with Almonds varieties, Hershey's produces several other chocolate bars in various flavors: Special Dark chocolate, Cookies 'N' Creme, Symphony (both Milk Chocolate and Almond Toffee), Mr. Goodbar (with peanuts), and Krackel (with crisped rice). Nine flavors were available for limited periods: Double Chocolate, Nut Lovers, Twosomes Reese's Pieces, Cookies 'N' Chocolate, Cookies 'N' Mint, Strawberries 'n' Creme, Raspberries 'n' Creme, Twosomes Heath, and Twosomes Whoppers. All flavors have between 210 and 230 calories per standard-sized bar. The Kashruth Division of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America approves all flavors for consumption by observant Jews, with OU Kosher status. The largest Hershey's bar commercially available weighs and costs US$59.99 on Hershey's website. A gold variant with pretzels and peanuts was sold for its 100th anniversary. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar product details from Hershey's site *Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds Bar product details from Hershey's site Category:Products introduced in 1900 Category:Chocolate bars Category:The Hershey Company brands Category:Kosher food ","title":"Hershey bar"},{"id":"2208589","text":"Acey Slade (born Emil John Schmidt IV; December 15, 1974) is an American musician and entrepreneur , perhaps best known as the bassist of the alternative metal band Dope and the former guitarist of the horror punk and glam metal act Murderdolls. He is currently the lead singer and guitarist of the band Acey Slade & the Dark Party, and the live rhythm guitarist of Misfits. Previous to this, he served as the bassist in Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and the lead vocalist and guitarist in the punk rock band Trashlight Vision, which broke up September 12, 2007. He lives in Newark, New Jersey. Acey is also a well known coffee aficionado. Slade and his wife Mei- Ling are also the owners of Cat Fight Coffee, based out of Newark, NJ. ==Career== Played in the Moon Dragons from Baltimore Maryland Prior to Vampire Love Dols, Murderdolls and Wednesday 13, Slade played bass, and later guitar, in Dope alongside guitarist Tripp Eisen who was also part of the Murderdolls. After Eisen left Dope, Slade was moved to guitar for the album Life. He later left Dope to join the Murderdolls, again replacing Eisen on guitar. Before joining the Murderdolls (alongside his Dope work), Slade also fronted a band known as the Vampire Love Dolls. After Murderdolls were put on hiatus in 2004 Slade filled in on guitar for punk/metal crossover band Amen for a tour of Japan. Slade played rhythm guitar on the track \\"Tired 'N Lonely\\" on Roadrunner United for Roadrunner Records' 25-year anniversary. He collaborated on the song with Joey Jordison, who also played in the Murderdolls with Slade. After the break-up of TrashLight Vision Slade filled in as guitarist for Wednesday 13 on his 2008 tour as well as taking time to produce records by His Mighty Robot (which remains unreleased) and Billy Liar. Slade is one of the contributors to the book Sex Tips from Rock Stars by Paul Miles published by Omnibus Press in July 2010 and was also used as the motion-capture model for the Punk Singer and Rock Guitarist characters on the video game Rock Band 2. Slade is currently touring and promoting his new band Acey Slade & the Dark Party, whose d√©but album The Dark Party was released in 2010, and is also playing bass with Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and filling in on bass for the occasional tour date with former band Dope.

Founded in 1450, it is the oldest of the University's colleges. In 1747 it merged with St Leonard's College to form United College. ==History== St. Salvator's College in 1843 St Salvator's Quad St Salvator's College was founded in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy. King James II of Scotland provided an endowment at the college's foundation and several of the original medieval buildings survive, including the college chapel, tower, tenement building (adjoining to the west of tower, actually older than the adjoining tower, but much restored) and the Hebdomodar's building. In 1528, the Protestant martyr, Patrick Hamilton, was burned alive outside the college, though Patrick himself was a member of St Leonard's college. Initially a college of Theology and the Arts, St Salvator's was created to revitalize and focus the university after its somewhat disorderly foundation. Due to financial considerations, fall in student numbers and general decline of the university, St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges amalgamated into the United College of Saint Salvator and Saint Leonard in 1747. Shortly after this, the initial site of St Leonard's College was sold, though the university retained ownership of St Leonard's College Chapel. Although the buildings of St Salvator's College (including the college chapel) were grand by medieval standards, they eventually fell into disrepair. From 1837 the quadrangle was rebuilt and extended into its current form, with a north and a west wing in Jacobean style (in similar style to Madras College on South Street built at the same time). To the south is the Chapel, where many university services are held. St Salvator's College was residential until the unification with St Leonard's. The current St Salvator's Hall (built from the 1930s), which lies east of the college, is one of the halls of residence for students. The chapel, tower and Hebdomadar's Building are all designated as Category A listed buildings by Historic Scotland. Other buildings and structures are listed as Category B. The college chapel is unusual for a collegiate church in that the main entrance faces out into the town, and not like those in Oxford or Cambridge, closed into the college itself. It is indeed the only collegiate chapel in Scotland with this arrangement. The chapel was used as a parish church after the St Leonard's college chapel was unroofed in the 1750s until this arrangement was withdrawn by the university. The 1450 college had cloister buildings to the north of the college chapel - the two doors to the north side of the chapel show the alignment of the cloister. Today, with the university having abandoned the Collegiate system in all but name, the St Salvator‚Äôs/United College site houses various lecture theatres, and the departments of Spanish, Russian, and social anthropology. It is commonly referred to as ‚Äúthe quad‚Äù, and is the setting of Raisin Monday festivities, the finish point of the post-Graduation processions, and occasionally hosts student events. ==ReferencesBibliography== *R.G.

Most or nearly all alphabetic scripts used throughout the world today ultimately go back to this Semitic proto-alphabet. Its first origins can be traced back to a Proto-Sinaitic script developed in Ancient Egypt to represent the language of Semitic-speaking workers and slaves in Egypt. Unskilled in the complex hieroglyphic system used to write the Egyptian language, which required a large number of pictograms, they selected a small number of those commonly seen in their Egyptian surroundings to describe the sounds, as opposed to the semantic values, of their own Canaanite language. This script was partly influenced by the older Egyptian hieratic, a cursive script related to Egyptian hieroglyphs.Himelfarb, Elizabeth J. \\"First Alphabet Found in Egypt\\", Archaeology 53, Issue 1 (Jan./Feb. 2000): 21. Mainly through Phoenician, Hebrew and later Aramaic, three closely related members of the Semitic family of scripts that were in use during the early first millennium BCE, the Semitic alphabet became the ancestor of multiple writing systems across the Middle East, Europe, northern Africa and South Asia. Some modern authors distinguish between consonantal scripts of the Semitic type, called \\"abjads\\" since 1996, and \\"true alphabets\\" in the narrow sense, the distinguishing criterion being that true alphabets consistently assign letters to both consonants and vowels on an equal basis, while the symbols in a pure abjad stand only for consonants. (So-called impure abjads may use diacritics or a few symbols to represent vowels.) In this sense, then the first true alphabet would be the Greek alphabet, which was adapted from the Phoenician alphabet, but not all scholars and linguists think this is enough to strip away the original meaning of an alphabet to one with both vowels and consonants. Latin, the most widely used alphabet today, in turn derives from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets, themselves derived from Phoenician. == Predecessors == Two scripts are well attested from before the end of the fourth millennium BCE: Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were employed in three ways in Ancient Egyptian texts: as logograms (ideograms) that represent a word denoting an object pictorially depicted by the hieroglyph; more commonly as phonograms writing a sound or sequence of sounds; and as determinatives (which provide clues to meaning without directly writing sounds). Since vowels were mostly unwritten, the hieroglyphs which indicated a single consonant could have been used as a consonantal alphabet (or \\"abjad\\"). This was not done when writing the Egyptian language, but seems to have been a significant influence on the creation of the first alphabet (used to write a Semitic language). All subsequent alphabets around the world have either descended from this first Semitic alphabet, or have been inspired by one of its descendants (i.e. \\"stimulus diffusion\\"), with the possible exception of the Meroitic alphabet, a 3rd-century BCE adaptation of hieroglyphs in Nubia to the south of Egypt. The Rongorongo script of Easter Island may also be an independently invented alphabet, but too little is known of it to be certain. == Consonantal alphabets  Semitic alphabet === The Proto-Sinaitic script of Egypt has yet to be fully deciphered. However, it may be alphabetic and probably records the Canaanite language. The oldest examples are found as graffiti in the Wadi el Hol and date to perhaps 1850 BCE.J. C. Darnell, F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, Marilyn J. Lundberg, P.

The script was used only sporadically, and retained its pictographic nature, for half a millennium, until adopted for governmental use in Canaan. The first Canaanite states to make extensive use of the alphabet were the Phoenician city-states and so later stages of the Canaanite script are called Phoenician. The Phoenician cities were maritime states at the center of a vast trade network and soon the Phoenician alphabet spread throughout the Mediterranean. Two variants of the Phoenician alphabet had major impacts on the history of writing: the Aramaic alphabet and the Greek alphabet. === Descendants of the Aramaic abjad === Chart showing details of four alphabets' descent from Phoenician abjad, from left to right Latin, Greek, original Phoenician, Hebrew, Arabic.

The light green shows the countries where the alphabet co-exists with other scripts. The Phoenician and Aramaic alphabets, like their Egyptian prototype, represented only consonants, a system called an abjad. The Aramaic alphabet, which evolved from the Phoenician in the 7th century BCE, to become the official script of the Persian Empire, appears to be the ancestor of nearly all the modern alphabets of Asia: *The modern Hebrew alphabet started out as a local variant of Imperial Aramaic.

Etruscan writing, the beginning of the writing with the Latin alphabet. By at least the 8th century BCE the Greeks borrowed the Phoenician alphabet and adapted it to their own language,McCarter, P. Kyle. \\"The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet\\", The Biblical Archaeologist 37, No. 3 (Sep., 1974): 54‚Äì68. page 62. . . creating in the process the first \\"true\\" alphabet, in which vowels were accorded equal status with consonants. According to Greek legends transmitted by Herodotus, the alphabet was brought from Phoenicia to Greece by Cadmos. The letters of the Greek alphabet are the same as those of the Phoenician alphabet, and both alphabets are arranged in the same order. However, whereas separate letters for vowels would have actually hindered the legibility of Egyptian, Phoenician, or Hebrew, their absence was problematic for Greek, where vowels played a much more important role.\\"there are languages for which an alphabet is not an ideal writing system. The Semitic abjads really do fit the structure of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic very well, [more] than an alphabet would [...], since the spelling ensures that each root looks the same through its plethora of inflections and derivations.\\" Peter Daniels, The World's Writing Systems, p. 27. The Greeks used for vowels some of the Phoenician letters representing consonants which weren't used in Greek speech. All of the names of the letters of the Phoenician alphabet started with consonants, and these consonants were what the letters represented, something called the acrophonic principle. However, several Phoenician consonants were absent in Greek, and thus several letter names came to be pronounced with initial vowels. Since the start of the name of a letter was expected to be the sound of the letter (the acrophonic principle), in Greek these letters came to be used for vowels. For example, the Greeks had no glottal stop or voiced pharyngeal sounds, so the Phoenician letters ‚Äôalep and \`ayin became Greek alpha and o (later renamed o micron), and stood for the vowels and rather than the consonants and . As this fortunate development only provided for five or six (depending on dialect) of the twelve Greek vowels, the Greeks eventually created digraphs and other modifications, such as ei, ou, and _o_ (which became omega), or in some cases simply ignored the deficiency, as in long a, i, u.Robinson, Andrew, (1995). The Story of Writing: Alphabets, Hieroglyphs & Pictograms, New York: Thames & Hudson Ltd. page 170. Several varieties of the Greek alphabet developed. One, known as Western Greek or Chalcidian, was used west of Athens and in southern Italy. The other variation, known as Eastern Greek, was used in Asia Minor (also called Asian Greece i.e. present-day aegean Turkey). The Athenians (c. 400 BCE) adopted that latter variation and eventually the rest of the Greek-speaking world followed. After first writing right to left, the Greeks eventually chose to write from left to right, unlike the Phoenicians who wrote from right to left. Many Greek letters are similar to Phoenician, except the letter direction is reversed or changed, which can be the result of historical changes from right-to-left writing to boustrophedon to left-to-right writing. ;Descendants World distribution of the Cyrillic alphabet. The dark green areas shows the countries where this alphabet is the sole main script. The light green shows the countries where the alphabet co-exists with other scripts. Greek is in turn the source of all the modern scripts of Europe. The alphabet of the early western Greek dialects, where the letter eta remained an , gave rise to the Old Italic alphabet which in turn developed into the Old Roman alphabet. In the eastern Greek dialects, which did not have an /h/, eta stood for a vowel, and remains a vowel in modern Greek and all other alphabets derived from the eastern variants: Glagolitic, Cyrillic, Armenian, Gothic (which used both Greek and Roman letters), and perhaps Georgian.Robinson, Andrew. The Story of Writing: Alphabets, Hieroglyphs & Pictograms. New York: Thames & Hudson Ltd., 1995. Although this description presents the evolution of scripts in a linear fashion, this is a simplification. For example, the Manchu alphabet, descended from the abjads of West Asia, was also influenced by Korean hangul, which was either independent (the traditional view) or derived from the abugidas of South Asia. Georgian apparently derives from the Aramaic family, but was strongly influenced in its conception by Greek. A modified version of the Greek alphabet, using an additional half dozen demotic hieroglyphs, was used to write Coptic Egyptian. Then there is Cree syllabics (an abugida), which is a fusion of Devanagari and Pitman shorthand developed by the missionary James Evans.Andrew Dalby (2004:139) Dictionary of Languages === Latin alphabet === World distribution of the Latin alphabet. The dark green areas show the countries where this alphabet is the sole main script. The light green shows the countries where the alphabet co-exists with other scripts. A tribe known as the Latins, who became the Romans, also lived in the Italian peninsula like the Western Greeks. From the Etruscans, a tribe living in the first millennium BCE in central Italy, and the Western Greeks, the Latins adopted writing in about the seventh century. In adopting writing from these two groups, the Latins dropped four characters from the Western Greek alphabet. They also adapted the Etruscan letter F, pronounced 'w,' giving it the 'f' sound, and the Etruscan S, which had three zigzag lines, was curved to make the modern S. To represent the G sound in Greek and the K sound in Etruscan, the Gamma was used. These changes produced the modern alphabet without the letters G, J, U, W, Y, and Z, as well as some other differences. C, K, and Q in the Roman alphabet could all be used to write both the and sounds; the Romans soon modified the letter C to make G, inserted it in seventh place, where Z had been, to maintain the gematria (the numerical sequence of the alphabet). Over the few centuries after Alexander the Great conquered the Eastern Mediterranean and other areas in the third century BCE, the Romans began to borrow Greek words, so they had to adapt their alphabet again in order to write these words. From the Eastern Greek alphabet, they borrowed Y and Z, which were added to the end of the alphabet because the only time they were used was to write Greek words. The Anglo-Saxons began using Roman letters to write Old English as they converted to Christianity, following Augustine of Canterbury's mission to Britain in the sixth century. Because the Runic wen, which was first used to represent the sound 'w' and looked like a p that is narrow and triangular, was easy to confuse with an actual p, the 'w' sound began to be written using a double u. Because the u at the time looked like a v, the double u looked like two v's, W was placed in the alphabet by V. U developed when people began to use the rounded U when they meant the vowel u and the pointed V when the meant the consonant V. J began as a variation of I, in which a long tail was added to the final I when there were several in a row. People began to use the J for the consonant and the I for the vowel by the fifteenth century, and it was fully accepted in the mid-seventeenth century.

Several scripts coexisted such as half-uncial and uncial, which derive from Roman cursive and Greek uncial, and Visigothic, Merovingian (Luxeuil variant here) and Beneventan. The Carolingian script was the basis for blackletter and humanist. What is commonly called \\"gothic writing\\" is technically called blackletter (here Textualis quadrata) and is completely unrelated to Visigothic script. The letter j is i with a flourish; u and v were the same letter in early scripts and were used depending on their position in insular half-uncial and caroline minuscule and later scripts; w is a ligature of vv; in insular the rune wynn is used as a w (three other runes in use were the thorn (√æ),  ªf√© º (·ö†) as an abbreviation for cattle/goods and ma√∞r (·õò) for man). The letters y and z were very rarely used; √æ was written identically to y, so y was dotted to avoid confusion; the dot was adopted for i only after late- Caroline (protgothic); in Benevetan script the macron abbreviation featured a dot above. Lost variants such as r rotunda, ligatures and scribal abbreviation marks are omitted; long s (≈ø) is shown when no terminal s (surviving variant) is present. Humanist script was the basis for Venetian types which have changed little to this day, such as Times New Roman (a serifed typeface) == Letter names and order == The order of the letters of the alphabet is attested from the fourteenth century BCE in the town of Ugarit on Syria's northern coast.Robinson, Andrew, (1995). The Story of Writing: Alphabets, Hieroglyphs & Pictograms, New York: Thames & Hudson Ltd. page 162. Tablets found there bear over one thousand cuneiform signs, but these signs are not Babylonian and there are only thirty distinct characters. About twelve of the tablets have the signs set out in alphabetic order. There are two orders found, one of which is nearly identical to the order used for Hebrew, Greek and Latin, and a second order very similar to that used for Ethiopian.Millard, A. R. \\"The Infancy of the Alphabet\\", World Archaeology 17, No. 3, Early Writing Systems (Feb., 1986): 390‚Äì398. page 395. . . It is not known how many letters the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet had nor what their alphabetic order was. Among its descendants, the Ugaritic alphabet had 27 consonants, the South Arabian alphabets had 29, and the Phoenician alphabet 22. These scripts were arranged in two orders, an ABGDE order in Phoenician and an HMƒ¶LQ order in the south; Ugaritic preserved both orders. Both sequences proved remarkably stable among the descendants of these scripts. The letter names proved stable among the many descendants of Phoenician, including Samaritan, Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek alphabet. However, they were largely abandoned in Tifinagh, Latin and Cyrillic. The letter sequence continued more or less intact into Latin, Armenian, Gothic, and Cyrillic, but was abandoned in Brahmi, Runic, and Arabic, although a traditional abjadi order remains or was re-introduced as an alternative in the latter. The table is a schematic of the Phoenician alphabet and its descendants. {  style=\\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\\" - ! nr. ! Reconstruction ! IPA ! value ! Ugaritic ! Phoenician !

Of the 29 consonant phonemes commonly reconstructed for Proto-Semitic, seven are missing: the interdental fricatives , the voiceless lateral fricatives , the voiced uvular fricative , and the distinction between uvular and pharyngeal voiceless fricatives , in Canaanite merged in . The six variant letters added in the Arabic alphabet include these (except for , which survives as a separate phoneme in Ge'ez ·à†): ‚Üí ·∏èƒÅl; ‚Üí ·πØƒÅ æ; ‚Üí ·∏çƒÅd; ‚Üí ƒ°ayn; ‚Üí ·∫ìƒÅ æ; ‚Üí ·∏´ƒÅ æ == Graphically independent alphabets == One modern national alphabet that has not been graphically traced back to the Canaanite alphabet is the Maldivian script, which is unique in that, although it is clearly modeled after Arabic and perhaps other existing alphabets, it derives its letter forms from numerals. Another is the Korean Hangul, which was created independently in 1443. The Osmanya alphabet was devised for Somali in the 1920s by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, and the forms of its consonants appear to be complete innovations. Among alphabets that are not used as national scripts today, a few are clearly independent in their letter forms. The Zhuyin phonetic alphabet and Japanese Kana both derive from Chinese characters. The Santali alphabet of eastern India appears to be based on traditional symbols such as \\"danger\\" and \\"meeting place\\", as well as pictographs invented by its creator. (The names of the Santali letters are related to the sound they represent through the acrophonic principle, as in the original alphabet, but it is the final consonant or vowel of the name that the letter represents: le \\"swelling\\" represents e, while en \\"thresh grain\\" represents n.) In early medieval Ireland, Ogham consisted of tally marks, and the monumental inscriptions of the Old Persian Empire were written in an essentially alphabetic cuneiform script whose letter forms seem to have been created for the occasion. == Alphabets in other media == Changes to a new writing medium sometimes caused a break in graphical form, or make the relationship difficult to trace. It is not immediately obvious that the cuneiform Ugaritic alphabet derives from a prototypical Semitic abjad, for example, although this appears to be the case. And while manual alphabets are a direct continuation of the local written alphabet (both the British two- handed and the French/American one-handed alphabets retain the forms of the Latin alphabet, as the Indian manual alphabet does Devanagari, and the Korean does Hangul), Braille, semaphore, maritime signal flags, and the Morse codes are essentially arbitrary geometric forms. The shapes of the English Braille and semaphore letters, for example, are derived from the alphabetic order of the Latin alphabet, but not from the graphic forms of the letters themselves. Most modern forms of shorthand are also unrelated to the alphabet, generally transcribing sounds instead of letters. == See also == * History of writing * History of the Arabic alphabet * History of the Latin alphabet * History of the Hebrew alphabet * History of the Greek alphabet * Runic alphabet * List of inventors of writing systems * List of languages by first written accounts == References  Further reading == * Brian E.

He was the original keyboard player with Small Faces. Winston had apparently previously worked under the stage name James Moody, before switching to Winston as a possible reference to Winston Churchill. His acting credits include the 1968 stage musical Hair and the 1972 Doctor Who serial Day of the Daleks. == Small Faces == In early 1965, Winston, along with his acquaintance Steve Marriott, formed Small Faces with Ronnie Lane and Kenney Jones. While originally a guitarist, his role was soon shifted to become a keyboardist. Winston was fundamental in the band's emergence, as his parents owned the Ruskin Arms pub located in Manor Park, a place where the group would rehearse and occasionally perform. After a performance at the Cavern Club on Leicester Square, an assistant of manager Don Arden stepped up to the band and managed to secure them a contract with Decca Records. The band released their debut single \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\" later that year, peaking at number 14. The success of this single would be followed by \\"I've Got Mine\\", which despite good reviews failed to chart. The group including Winston performed the song in Dateline Diamonds (1965). Shortly after this release, Winston left the group, and was promptly replaced by Ian McLagan. A factor that has been rumoured about his termination is that during an episode of Thank Your Lucky Stars, Winston snubbed Marriott. There has been controversy whether Winston left the group himself or was fired. Lane stated in an interview that he was fired: However, Kenney Jones later said: \\"He [Winston] got above his station and tried to compete with Steve Marriott.\\" Reality is he left. == Death == Winston died on 26 September 2020, at the age of 75. == Discography  Solo === \\"Sun In the Morning\\" / \\"Just Wanna Smile\\" (1976) === with Small Faces === (While he is credited as the sole keyboardist on their first two singles, Winston is also credited on some tracks on four further albums released by the band) * \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\" / \\"What's A Matter Baby\\" (1965) * \\"I've Got Mine\\" / \\"It's Too Late\\" (1965) * Small Faces (1966) * From the Beginning (1967) * The Autumn Stone (1969) * The BBC Sessions (1999) === with Jimmy Winston and His Reflections === \\"Sorry She's Mine\\" / \\"It's Not What You Do (But the Way That You Do It)\\" (1966) === with Winston's Fumbs === \\"Real Crazy Apartment\\" / \\"Snow White\\" (1967) == Filmography == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Role ! scope=\\"col\\" Director ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\" Dateline Diamonds 1966 Himself Jeremy Summers as a member of Small Faces - ! scope=\\"row\\" Doctor in the House  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1969 Hairy  rowspan=\\"2\\" David Askey Episode: The Students Are Revolting! - ! scope=\\"row\\" Never a Cross Word Hippie Episode: Sir or Madam - ! scope=\\"row\\" No Blade of Grass  rowspan=\\"3\\" 1970 1st Hun.

He was the first to describe numerous species of Siberian flora and the lifestyles of native ethnic peoples. ==Early life== Lieutenant-colonel Arsenyev in 1917. Arseniev was born in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire. His father, born a serf, became the chief of the Moscow District Railway. After a military education, Arseniev began his expeditions to the forests of the Far East. He lived in Vladivostok through the years of the Russian Civil War and was a Commissar for Ethnic Minorities (Komisar po delam inrodcheskim) of the independent Far Eastern Republic. After the Far Eastern Republic was absorbed by Soviet Russia in 1922 Arsenyev refused to emigrate and stayed in Vladivostok. ==Work== Arsenyev and Dersu Uzala. 1956 Soviet postage stamp commemorating Vladimir Arsenyev. Arseniev is most famous for authoring many books about his explorations, including some 60 works on the geography, wildlife and ethnography of the regions he traveled. Arseniev's most famous book, Dersu Uzala, is a memoir of three expeditions in the Ussurian taiga (forest) of Northern Asia along the Sea of Japan and North to Vladivostok. The book is named after Arseniev's guide, an Ussurian native of the Nanai/Goldi tribe. Eventually the book was made into two films, one by Soviet director Agasi Babayan in 1961, the other by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in 1975. The latter Dersu Uzala version won that year's Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film. The third book of Arsenyev's trilogy, In the Sikhote-Alin mountains, was published posthumously in 1937. ==Personal life== Arseniev died in 1930 in Vladivostok at the age of 57. His widow, Margarita Nikolaevna Arsenieva, was arrested in 1934 and again in 1937 after being accused of being a member of an underground organization of spies and saboteurs allegedly headed by her late husband. The military court hearings of the case (21 August 1938) took only 10 minutes and sentenced her to death. She was executed immediately. Arsenyev's daughter Natalya also was arrested in April 1941 and sentenced to the Gulag. ==Legacy== Arsenyev‚Äôs family home in Vladivostok has been made into a museum. Arsenyev, a town located in Primorsky Krai, was named after him. In 2018 Vladivostok International airport was renamed after him. ==Bibliography== *\\"–ü–æ –£—Å—Å—É—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º—É –∫—Ä–∞—é (–î–µ—Ä—Å—É –£–∑–∞–ª–∞). –ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤ –≥–æ—Ä–Ω—É—é –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å \\"–°–∏—Ö–æ—Ç—ç-–ê–ª–∏–Ω—å\\" (Po Ussuriyskomu Krayu) (Vladivostok 1921), the first book of Dersu Uzala trilogy. *\\"–î–µ—Ä—Å—É –£–∑–∞–ª–∞ –ò–∑ –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–π –æ –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è—Ö –ø–æ –£—Å—Å—É—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º—É –∫—Ä–∞—é –≤ 1907 –≥. –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫\\" (Dersu Uzala) (1923). *\\"Dersu Uzala\\" translated by Malcolm Burr as \\"Dersu the trapper.\\" Kingston, N.Y.: McPherson & Company, 1996. *\\"–í –≥–æ—Ä–∞—Ö –°–∏—Ö–æ—Ç—ç-–ê–ª–∏–Ω—è\\" (In the Sikhote-Alin Mountains), the third book of the Dersu-Uzala trilogy, published posthumously in 1937 *\\"–ú–∏—Ñ—ã, –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≥–æ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞\\" (Mify, legendy, predaniya i skazki narodov Dal'nego Vostoka) (Myths, legends, traditions, and fables of peoples of Far East).

He was primarily an opening batsman, noted especially for the quality of his off-drive. Neville Cardus wrote that he \\"was amongst the most precisely technical and most prolific batsmen of any time in the annals of cricket.\\"Barclays World of Cricket ‚Äì 2nd Edition, 1980, Collins Publishers, , p172. He was only the second batsman to reach the landmark of 100 first-class centuries, following WG Grace. In the 1906 English season he scored 3,518 runs, a record aggregate since surpassed only by Denis Compton and Bill Edrich in 1947.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 2008 edition, p281. ==Career== Born 29 March 1871 in Cambridge Hayward came from a cricketing family: his grandfather, father and uncle had all played first-class cricket.His grandfather Daniel played (1832‚Äì1851) for Cambridge Town Club, Surrey and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC); his father (also Daniel) played (1852‚Äì1869) for Cambridge Town Club, Surrey and Cambridgeshire. Hayward's famous uncle, Thomas Hayward, was a leading batsman who played 1854‚Äì1872 for Cambridge Town Club, Cambridgeshire and numerous representative teams including the England team that made the inaugural overseas tour to North America in 1859. Hayward himself made his debut for Surrey in 1893 and quickly established himself as an important part of the side, being capped in 1894 and receiving the accolade of Wisden Cricketer of the Year the following season. Although primarily a batsman, Hayward took 481 wickets in first class cricket, taking 114 in the 1897 season. GL Jessop referred to him as an awkward bowler, who bowled wide of the crease and achieved unexpected nip off the wicket that seduced the unwary batsman into an injudicious stroke. From 1895 through to his final season in 1914, Hayward never once failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs, passing 2,000 on ten occasions and twice (in 1904 and 1906) scoring over 3,000; his 1906 aggregate of 3,518 (at 66.37 with 13 hundreds) established a record which stood until surpassed by Denis Compton and Bill Edrich in 1947. In 1898 he made his highest first-class score of 315 against Lancashire. In 1899 he and Bobby Abel put on 448 for Surrey's fourth wicket against Yorkshire. This remains the highest partnership for any wicket for Surrey. In 1900 he achieved the very rare feat of scoring 1,000 runs before the end of May. Hayward's first Test match for England came on tour with Lord Hawke's side against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in 1895/96, and in his second Test (at Johannesburg) he hit 122 as England recorded an innings victory. In all he played 35 times for England scoring three hundreds, his last innings coming against Australia in 1909: run out for six to finish just one run short of 2,000 for his Test career. He scored 130 at Old Trafford in the fourth Test of the 1899 Ashes series, batting at number six. He came in at 47 for 4, and enabled the final total to reach 372. It was described as \\"one of the great Test innings\\" by Ralph Barker.Barker, Ralph & Rosenwater, Irving, England v Australia: A compendium of Test cricket between the countries 1877‚Äì1968, B.T. Batsford, 1969, , p80. He followed that up in the fifth Test, at The Oval, with 137, putting on 185 for the first wicket with FS Jackson. He headed the batting averages for both sides in this series, in seven innings scoring 413 runs at 68.83. Once Jack Hobbs made his Surrey debut in 1905, he and Hayward formed an effective opening partnership for the county. The pair put on a hundred or more for the first wicket on 40 occasions.Surrey County Cricket Club First-Class Records 1846‚Äì2000, Limited Overs Records 1963‚Äì2000, compiled by The Surrey Statistics Group, published by Surrey County Cricket Club, p61. They only played together once for England, opening the innings when Hayward was recalled for what was to prove his final Test, at Lord's in 1909. Despite a gradual decline in his athleticism in his later career, Hayward remained an effective batsman well into his forties, and in June 1913 he scored his hundredth first-class century, becoming only the second batsman (after W. G. Grace) to achieve this feat. He made his 104th and final hundred in August 1914 against Yorkshire at Lord's (where Surrey played several \\"home\\" matches after World War I had begun), but made just one in his last innings of all, against Gloucestershire back at The Oval and on grounds of age did not resume his career after the end of hostilities. Surrey won the County Championship in his final season. Hayward had the rare honour for a professionalIts rarity is indicated by the fact that when Leicestershire appointed Ewart Astill as their captain for the 1935 season he became the first professional to regularly captain any county during the twentieth century. Barclay's World of Cricket ‚Äì 2nd Edition, 1980, Collins Publishers, , p397. of the time of captaining the side for six matches in August when the regular captain, Cyril Wilkinson, was unavailable, in preference to the young amateurs Donald Knight and Percy Fender.Scorecard of the first of the matches in August, 1914 in which Hayward captained Surrey Hayward in 1926 Although primarily known as a batsman, Hayward was also an effective bowler for his county in the middle of his career. In 1897 he did the \\"double\\", with 1,368 runs and 114 wickets, and in 1899 he took two hat-tricks. His best bowling of 8‚Äì89 was achieved against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1901. Hayward was respected as a model professional. Of his final years with Surrey, David Lemmon wrote: \\"He was the senior professional in all aspects, setting down standards of behaviour which others violated at their peril. He led by bearing and by example.\\"David Lemmon, The History of Surrey County Cricket Club, Christopher Helm, 1989, , p136. He stood in one first-class match as an umpire, the 1920 game between Oxford University and Essex. He died 19 July 1939 in Cambridge at the age of 68. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * * Category:1871 births Category:1939 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1890 to 1918 Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Surrey cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Players of the South cricketers Category:Home Counties cricketers Category:Lord Hawke's XI cricketers Category:C.

He started playing piano at the age of six, and was composing his own music by twelve, inspired in part by Broadway musicals. He liked rock music, but also admired B√©la Bart√≥k, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. He attended the Eastman School of Music with aspirations of becoming a classical composer and conductor, and then Bennington College in Vermont in 1976. While still in school, he cut his teeth doing the music for movie trailers, most notably Alien, and later scored the trailers for Blade Runner, Gandhi, and Back to the Future. He went on to work on numerous movie soundtracks, starting with Children of the Corn and including Tuff Turf, Parents, Chaplin, and more. ==1980s== He and his brother Scott Elias founded the music and advertising firm Elias Associates in 1980; it later became Elias Arts. The company had several notable successes, including the crunching \\"Moon Landing\\" theme used in the top-of-the-hour branding of MTV, the Columbia Pictures logo theme, and the famous Yahoo! yodel. He met John Barry (of James Bond soundtrack fame) in the early 1980s, and began working with him on several movie soundtracks, including Jagged Edge and A View to a Kill. It was during the A View to a Kill sessions in 1985 that Elias met and became friends with the members of pop group Duran Duran (they performed the title song for the movie). While working on the soundtrack to the film 9¬Ω Weeks the year after that, Elias co-wrote the single \\"I Do What I Do\\" with Duran Duran's bassist John Taylor, who performed the vocals ‚Äî his first solo venture. The song went to #42 on the UK Singles Chart, and to #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. Elias and Taylor also co-wrote and co- produced the melancholy piano instrumental \\"Jazz\\", released on the b-side of the single. Elias and Taylor went on to co-write an album's worth of additional unreleased material together that year, which would eventually be collected on Taylor's 1999 album R√©sum√©.Taylor, John. , February 23, 1999. Elias produced an album for Grace Jones and co-produced (with Daniel Abraham) Duran Duran's 1988 album Big Thing. He also returned to play Moog synthesizer on Duran Duran's 1995 album Thank You. In 1989, Elias recruited the entire Duran Duran lineup for his first solo album, called Requiem for the Americas. The most recognizable of Duran Duran's contributions to the album was vocalist Simon Le Bon's solo track \\"Follow In My Footsteps\\", which also featured The Bangles vocalist Susanna Hoffs on backup vocals. John Taylor played bass on \\"The Chant Movement\\", with other Duran members adding their instrumental touches on various tracks. Other vocalists on the album included Grace Jones, Toni Childs, Michael Bolton, Patti Scialfa, and Jon Anderson. ==1990s‚Äî2000s== Elias then worked with the band Yes on their 1991 album Union. Many band members were not speaking to each other, and the disjointed working atmosphere and the involvement of outside musicians (which allowed the piece to be finished at all) led to an uneven album which was generally unpopular with critics and fans. Elias was often blamed for the album's failure.Potts, Henry. Interview with Jonathan Elias, Bondegezou, March 2001. In 1992, Elias moved to California, and shifted his focus from movies and rock music to advertising. His firm Elias Arts has won an Emmy Award for the \\"Move\\" theme for Nike Inc., and has garnered dozens of Clio Awards and other advertising trophies for work for top-line corporations such as Ford, GM, Nissan, Audi, Infiniti, Mercedes, AT&T;, NASDAQ, IBM, Apple, Sony, Levi's, and Adidas. Elias released another solo project, The Prayer Cycle, in 1999. This is a nine-part contemporary choral symphony in twelve languages (including Hebrew, Latin, Swahili and Urdu). Vocalists on this album include Alanis Morissette, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Ofra Haza, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Salif Keita, and Yungchen Lhamo of Tibet. In 2004, he released American River, a work combining piano and string quartet compositions with spoken word performances by Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, Marty Stuart, Rosanne Cash and Johnny Cash (in one of his last recorded works). American River was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in that year. He also collaborated with Robert Downey, Jr. on his 2004 solo album The Futurist and on the soundtrack for Downey's film The Singing Detective. , his most recent movie work has been on A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints (2006) and Pathfinder (2007), with the help of co- composers Jimmy Haun, David Wittman, Nathaniel Morgan and Tim Davies.Jonathan Elias at the Internet Movie Database His most recent album is Prayer Cycle 2: Path to Zero, released in 2011.

It was recorded as the centerpiece of a reunion among the five original band members: Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke. The last time that all five members had worked together as the Byrds was in 1966, prior to Clark's departure from the band. During the reunion, the current, latter-day lineup of the band continued to make live appearances until February 1973, with McGuinn being the only member common to both versions of the group. Upon its release, Byrds received generally poor reviews, with many critics bemoaning a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds' signature jangly guitar sound among the album's shortcomings. Nonetheless, the album reached number 20 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart and was also moderately successful in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 31. In the U.S., Byrds was the band's highest charting album of new material since 1965's Turn! Turn! Turn!, which had also been the last Byrds' album to feature Clark as a full member. Three of the album's songs, \\"Full Circle\\", \\"Things Will Be Better\\", and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\", were released as singles during 1973, but none of these releases became hits. ==Background== By 1972, the Byrds' guitarist and leader, Roger McGuinn, had grown dissatisfied with the current version of the group. As the only member to have remained consistent since the band's inception in 1964, McGuinn had steered the Byrds through a dizzying array of lineup changes during the late 1960s. The band's membership had finally stabilized in 1970, but by early 1972 dissension was brewing due to disagreements over band members' pay. As a result of this, Gene Parsons (the band's drummer since 1968) was fired by McGuinn in July 1972 and replaced by session musician John Guerin. The Byrds continued to tour and record sporadically throughout 1972, but no new single or album was forthcoming. Concurrently, the four ex-members of the Byrds who, along with McGuinn, had comprised the original mid-1960s lineup of the band, were, to an extent, at loose ends: David Crosby had completed his recording and touring obligations for the Graham Nash/David Crosby album; Chris Hillman's work with the Stephen Stills' helmed band Manassas was winding down; Gene Clark's critically lauded but financially unrewarding solo career was in need of a boost; and Michael Clarke had been without a band since the break up of the Flying Burrito Brothers in 1971. Furthermore, none of the five original band members' careers‚Äîwith the exception of Crosby's‚Äîhad been as financially rewarding as during The Byrds' mid-1960s heyday. Tentative discussions between the five original members of the band, regarding a possible reunion, had taken place as early as July 1971, around the time that the then current lineup of the Byrds were recording their final album, Farther Along. News of these discussions was leaked to the British music press, and in late January 1972, one week after the UK release of Farther Along, the front page of Disc and Music Echo featured the headline, \\"Original Byrds To Reform?\\" The attendant article suggested that the reunion album would be a one-off project and that the current lineup of the Byrds would continue to tour and record, with no question of disbanding. Meanwhile, with the successful supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young on indefinite hiatus, while the individual members worked on other projects, managers David Geffen and Elliot Roberts had seen their attempts to bring a new CSNY album to the marketplace thwarted. In the absence of any new Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young product, Geffen became acutely aware that a historic reunion of the original Byrds could prove to be highly lucrative for all concerned. Thus, in mid-1972, Geffen weighed in with a substantial offer to the five original members to record a reunion album for his Asylum label. The reunion actually took place in early October 1972, beginning with a rehearsal at McGuinn's house, where the band initially worked on one of the guitarist's new songs. Significantly, the group played none of their old material during this first rehearsal, but instead concentrated on selecting suitable songs for a new project. All five musicians were encouraged by the rehearsal and felt sure that they could recreate the magic of the Byrds' golden era. Consequently, they agreed to commence the recording of their first album together in seven years, with the last time that all five had worked together as the Byrds being early 1966, prior to Gene Clark's departure from the band. However, the reunited group were determined that the internal conflict that tore them apart during the 1960s would not be allowed to rear its head again. It was therefore agreed that they would not be a band in the traditional sense, but rather a loose arrangement of solo artists, akin to the modus operandi of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. With considerable leverage from Geffen, McGuinn managed to secure permission from Columbia Records‚Äîto which he was still contracted‚Äîto record a one-off album for the Asylum label. As part of the deal, Clive Davis, the president of Columbia Records, specified that McGuinn and Crosby would be required to record a joint album together for Columbia, which was to be released in 1973. However, this planned Crosby/McGuinn album failed to materialize, due to Davis being fired from Columbia shortly after the exchange deal was struck. While the original quintet prepared to record the reunion album, the existing Columbia lineup of the Byrds, featuring McGuinn, Clarence White, Skip Battin, and John Guerin, continued to make concert appearances in the United States. ==Recording== Recording sessions for the reunion album began on October 16, 1972 in room #4 of Wally Heider's Studio 3 recording facility in Los Angeles and continued until at least November 15, 1972. During these sessions, the band recorded all eleven of the songs that would appear on the finished album and at least two outtakes: the McGuinn and Jacques Levy penned \\"My New Woman\\" and the traditional folk song \\"Fair and Tender Ladies\\". In 2009, a cache of multitrack tapes dating from the Byrds' reunion sessions and featuring a number of alternate versions and at least one outtake were discovered. The tapes include work-in-progress versions and alternate takes of the songs \\"Laughing\\", \\"(See the Sky) About to Rain\\", and \\"Long Live the King\\" (listed on the tape box under its working title of \\"The King is Dead\\"). In addition, the tapes also contained three different versions of the traditional song \\"Fair and Tender Ladies\\". Reportedly, one of these versions of the song features Crosby singing lead vocals, while the other two feature Clark. Also included among the recordings is a track with the title \\"The Circle Song\\", but it is not known whether this refers to the Clark penned \\"Full Circle\\" or to another previously undocumented outtake‚Äîperhaps a cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"The Circle Game\\"? Although it was not included on the reunion album, the Byrds' recording of McGuinn and Levy's \\"My New Woman\\" was later released on the guitarist's 1973 solo album, Roger McGuinn. Following completion of the album's recording sessions, Crosby reached an agreement with McGuinn to dissolve the latter-day lineup of the Byrds, who were at that time still working as a touring band. Crosby had long been vocal about his displeasure over McGuinn's decision to recruit new members following his dismissal from the band in 1967 and had publicly stated his opinion that, \\"there were only ever five Byrds.\\" In the new spirit of reconciliation fostered by the reunion, and as a result of his own growing dissatisfaction with the current incarnation of the band, McGuinn acquiesced and permanently disbanded the latter-day lineup of the Byrds in February 1973. The tracks that would make up the finished album included two from each of the four songwriters in the band, as well as a Joni Mitchell cover and two songs written by Neil Young. At the time of the album's release, much was made in the music press over the lack of any Bob Dylan songs, since the Byrds had covered Dylan's material frequently during the 1960s. This criticism prompted Crosby to contend that Young was the great songwriter of the 1970s, just as Dylan had been for the 1960s, and therefore it was entirely appropriate that the Byrds should be covering Young, rather than Dylan. ==Music== The opening track on the album, Clark's \\"Full Circle\\", had initially given the album its working title, but Clark was concerned that the public might mistakenly assume that the song had been written specifically for the Byrds' reunion. As the band's biographer Johnny Rogan has remarked, the song's wheel of fortune motif certainly seemed applicable, but the song actually predated the reunion, as Clark explained during a 1979 interview: \\"I'd already recorded that song a couple of years earlier and it wasn't really written about anything specific. It was just an idea I had.\\" Not only had the song been written by Clark prior to the Byrds' reunion, but by the time that Byrds was released, it had also recently been issued under the alternate title of \\"Full Circle Song\\" on Clark's Roadmaster album. A second Clark original included on Byrds was \\"Changing Heart\\", which served as a meditation on the pitfalls of stardom. Clark was also featured singing lead vocals on the album's pair of Neil Young covers. The decision to cover Young's \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"(See the Sky) About to Rain\\" was made by Clark, who had long admired the Canadian singer‚Äìsongwriter, and not by Young's CSNY bandmate David Crosby, as was assumed by the press at the time. Rogan has described \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" as making striking use of the band's crystal clear harmonies, while Clark's harmonica playing lends the song a distinctive country flavor, perfectly in keeping with the song's subject matter. \\"(See the Sky) About to Rain\\", on the other hand, featured some attractive mandolin playing from the band's bassist Chris Hillman and climaxed with a chiming final√©, featuring the Byrds' signature jangling Rickenbacker guitars. The Byrds' version of \\"(See the Sky) About to Rain\\" was released over a year before it appeared on Young's 1974 album On the Beach. \\"Sweet Mary\\", co-written by McGuinn and Jacques Levy, saw the Byrds' lead guitarist reverting to a folkier style of songwriting than he had exhibited of late, with Hillman again contributing some prominent mandolin to the song. McGuinn's other songwriting contribution to Byrds was \\"Born to Rock 'n' Roll\\", a semi-serious, autobiographical contemplation of the guitarist's career as a professional musician. The song had initially been recorded by the latter-day lineup of the Byrds in July 1972 for possible release as a single, but ultimately that version had been shelved and remained unreleased at the time. McGuinn decided to make another attempt at producing a definitive recording of the song during the reunion sessions, resulting in a rendition that the guitarist himself was dissatisfied with. McGuinn would later record the song for a third time on his 1975 solo album Roger McGuinn & Band, but yet again he was unhappy with the end result, leading him to pointedly conclude in a later interview that \\"'Born to Rock 'n' Roll' was a dog.\\" Hillman contributed two songs to the album, both co-authored with ex- Manassas bandmates: \\"Things Will Be Better\\", co-written with drummer Dallas Taylor, and \\"Borrowing Time\\", co-written with percussionist Joe Lala. The former song deals with the unpredictable nature of fame and stardom, a theme that was echoed in Clark's \\"Full Circle\\" and \\"Changing Heart\\". Crosby contributed the song \\"Long Live the King\\", a cynical commentary on the star- making mechanics of the music business, which Byrds expert Tim Connors has described as ironic, since it was precisely those same materialistic business practices that had enabled The Byrds' reunion to transpire in the first place. Crosby also chose to revisit the song \\"Laughing\\", which had already been released on his first solo album, If I Could Only Remember My Name, in 1971. Crosby's rationale for re-recording the song was that he had originally written \\"Laughing\\" in 1967, during his last days as a member of the Byrds and as such, it had initially been intended for inclusion on a Byrds' album. The version of \\"Laughing\\" featured on Byrds saw the return of McGuinn's raga rock style of guitar playing, which had last been utilized on the band's Fifth Dimension and Younger Than Yesterday albums. Crosby also sang the lead vocal on the album's Joni Mitchell cover, \\"For Free\\". ==Release and reception== Byrds was released on March 7, 1973 in the United States (catalogue item SD 5058) and March 24, 1973 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item SYLA 8754). Although the album was issued in stereo commercially, there are mono promo copies of the LP known to exist. The album's sleeve was adorned with photographs taken by Henry Diltz, which fittingly pictured the band in the L.A. folk club The Troubadour, where McGuinn, Clark, and Crosby had first formed the nucleus of the Byrds in 1964. The album peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, during a chart stay of seventeen weeks, making it the band's highest charting album of new material in the U.S. since 1965's Turn! Turn! Turn! album. In the UK, the album reached number 31, but only remained on the UK Albums Chart for one week. A total of four singles were taken from the album, beginning with \\"Full Circle\\" b/w \\"Long Live the King\\", which was released on April 11, 1973 and which reached number 109 on the Billboard chart. Two further singles taken from the album during 1973‚Äî\\"Things Will Be Better\\" b/w \\"For Free\\" (which was issued exclusively in the UK and Europe), and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" b/w \\"Long Live the King\\"‚Äîfailed to chart. Finally, a fourth single, \\"Full Circle\\" b/w \\"Things Will Be Better\\", was released in the UK in August 1975, almost two-and-a-half years after the album had first appeared, but this too failed to reach the charts. Upon its release, the album suffered from generally poor reviews, with Jon Landau, in an April 1973 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, criticizing it as \\"one of the dullest albums of the year.\\" Landau went on to note the disunity evident on the album: \\"It is a different band for each of the four lead singers and while they make complementary music, it is never a continuous piece, which is what the Byrds were once all about.\\" Reviewing the album in Creem, Robert Christgau gave it a \\"C\\" and faulted Crosby for this \\"country-rock supersession\\", performed by \\"a bunch of stars fabricating a paper reconciliation\\" rather than a \\"a group, committed however fractiously to a coherent collective identity\\". In fact, the consensus of most reviewers was that there was a lack of unity throughout the album and that the band's trademark jingle-jangle guitar sound was largely absent from the record. However, there were some positive reviews of the album, with Danny Halloway enthusiastically praising it in the March 31, 1973 edition of the NME: \\"The Byrds have overcome the novelty of reforming and really do cut it here. The band's direction is no-nonsense, straight-ahead music. There's not any cultural preaching or sloppy outtakes as intros ... I'm glad to report that The Byrds make it on the strength of the music alone.\\" ==Post-release== The largely unenthusiastic press reaction to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith in the concept of an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: \\"I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time.\\" Hillman concurred with Clark, telling the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, \\"In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence.\\" Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: \\"everybody was so afraid of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other.\\" McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: \\"David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't remember much recording.\\" In addition, author John Einarson has suggested that none of the parties‚Äîsave for perhaps Clark‚Äîseemed willing to contribute their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told Einarson, \\"I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I was getting ready to do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway stuff that was awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck.\\" McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added, \\"I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them my best stuff at the time.\\" The timing of the album, between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reunions, the fact that it was produced by Crosby, and the presence of the individual band members' names on the album cover has led to the suggestion that the album was intended as something of a substitute for CSNY. For his part, Crosby's motivation for taking over production duties on the album may have been an attempt to finally exert dominance over the rest of the band, as he had tried to do during his earlier tenure with the Byrds. McGuinn certainly supported this viewpoint, as he revealed in a 1977 interview: \\"Crosby was calling the shots. It was his coup d'√©tat. He wanted to minimize my importance in the group, and maximize his, and other people's.\\" Both McGuinn and Hillman were actively touring between recording sessions for the album, the former with the Columbia version of the Byrds and the latter with Manassas. With only sporadic availability of two of the band's four creative parties, the brunt of assembling the album was left to the otherwise unengaged Crosby and Clark, which could account for the preponderance of Clark vocals and the CSNY-esque production on the album. Byrds has been reissued on CD a number of times: first by Elektra Records in 1990; then again in 1998 by WEA; then in 2004 as a remastered edition on Wounded Bird Records; and again by Rhino Records in 2005 and 2008. Most recently, the album has been reissued by Raven Records in 2014, with the addition of two previously released bonus tracks, both recorded by Clark in 1971 and featuring all five members of the Byrds. ==Track listingSide one=== #\\"Full Circle\\" (Gene Clark) ‚Äì 2:43 #\\"Sweet Mary\\" (Roger McGuinn, Jacques Levy) ‚Äì 2:55 #\\"Changing Heart\\" (Gene Clark) ‚Äì 2:42 #\\"For Free\\" (Joni Mitchell) ‚Äì 3:50 #\\"Born to Rock 'n' Roll\\" (Roger McGuinn) ‚Äì 3:12 ===Side two=== #\\"Things Will Be Better\\" (Chris Hillman, Dallas Taylor) ‚Äì 2:13 #\\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" (Neil Young) ‚Äì 3:24 #\\"Long Live the King\\" (David Crosby) ‚Äì 2:17 #\\"Borrowing Time\\" (Chris Hillman, Joe Lala) ‚Äì 2:00 #\\"Laughing\\" (David Crosby) ‚Äì 5:38 #\\"(See the Sky) About to Rain\\" (Neil Young) ‚Äì 3:49 ===2014 reissue bonus tracks=== #\\"She's the Kind of Girl\\" (Gene Clark) ‚Äì 3:00 #\\"One in a Hundred\\" (Gene Clark) ‚Äì 2:45 ==Singles== #\\"Full Circle\\" b/w \\"Long Live the King\\" (Asylum 11016) April 11, 1973 (US #109) #\\"Things Will Be Better\\" b/w \\"For Free\\" (AYM 516) April 24, 1973 #\\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" b/w \\"Long Live the King\\" (Asylum 11019) June 1973 #\\"Full Circle\\" b/w \\"Things Will Be Better\\" (AYM 545) August 8, 1975 ==Personnel== Adapted from the books So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day, The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited and the album liner notes.

It is the first brand that adopted the charcoal filter in American blend in Japan. Initially it was designed to treat Mild Seven similar to Seven Stars, but in accordance with the fact that JT changed the F1 participation brand from Cabin (another Japanese brand owned by JT) to Mild Seven in 1994, the vertical blue left side of the white background was changed to a belt design. At the time of this, the advertising slogan \\"The blue world of mild seven\\" was used in the television commercials, and after that blue became the colour of choice for the brand. The cigarettes are the third most widely smoked cigarette in the world with 76.5 billion around the world, behind Marlboro and Camel. The Mevius under the Mild Seven name has been a top seller since its creation in 1977 and is the second largest cigarette brand in the world. On August 8, 2012, Japan Tobacco announced that the longtime Mild Seven brand name would be changed to Mevius, due to legislation around the branding of cigarettes as \\"mild\\" in some countries; and in an attempt to strengthen the brand's \\"premium image\\". The name change began in Japan in February, followed by Singapore and Korea the following month. ==ControversyCounterfeit Mild Sevens from North Korea=== In 2006, it was reported that counterfeit Mild Seven cigarettes were smuggled and sold outside of Japan. The pack design is very similar but the quality of the cigarettes such as scent and taste are not. The tobacco used in the counterfeit cigarettes is not comparable with genuine brands. According to the survey results both inside and outside of Japan, there is strong suspicion that these fake cigarette are manufactured as a part of the foreign currency fund acquisition activity by North Korea. ===Mild Sevens recalled due to faulty filter=== In December 2007, Japan Tobacco recalled some of the Mild Seven brand cigarettes sold in stores in Tokyo and neighbouring prefectures because of faulty filters. Japan Tobacco said 14,500 cigarettes would be recalled, including 2,500 faulty ones, which were shipped to 225 stores in Tokyo and three other prefectures on December 13, 2007. The faulty filters of the cigarettes were not glued on properly and were likely to come off, the company said. Japan Tobacco planned to finish the recall by the end of Wednesday, said company spokeswoman Shoko Hamamoto. ===JTI Korea pays Instagram users to promote Mevius=== In September 2017, it was reported that JTI Korea had been paying Instagram users who had a lot of followers to post photos of its Mevius brand cigarettes, according to a document obtained by The Korea Times. In return, Instagram \\"influencers,\\" most of whom were men in their 20s and 30s, are said to have received as much as 5 million Won ($4,400) for each post. These photos primarily aim to spark interest in Mevius among women who follow young, fashion-savvy men who upload photos of their daily lives. A bigger program with JTI's marketing on the photo-centered social networking service (SNS) platform is that underage users are indiscriminately exposed to these photos glamorizing cigarettes because anyone, regardless of age, can join Instagram and view pictures posted by others. In Korea's \\"Tobacco Business Act\\", there are no specific rules yet governing cigarette makers' marketing and sales activities on Instagram, Facebook and other SNS platforms. One Instagram user came forward and informed The Korea Times of Instagram Influencer Guidelines to let the public know about JTI Korea's dubious SNS marketing. He said he was approached by a person from JTI Korea's marketing team in June 2017. \\"JTI systematically recruited young male Instagram users who have at least 10,000 followers\\" the user said anonymously. \\"I heard they were offered 4 to 5 million Won for each post for a month, depending on the number of their followers. The users were given this piece of paper outlining how they should take photos and depict them\\". The company's marketing tactic is disgraceful, he said, stressing minors, particularly young girls, have been exposed to hundreds of photos that beautify smoking. \\"Many young girls closely follow these handsome men in their 20s and 30s who regularly post photos of their well-shaped bodies. They have certainly viewed many of these Mevius pictures\\" the user said. \\"I decided to let people know about JTI's unethical marketing, due to concerns that teenagers may become more inclined to smoke cigarettes\\". JTI's guidelines outline how Instagram users take photos and what phrases they should use when depicting photos. However, JTI Korea denied drawing up such guidelines, stressing it had never conducted marketing on SNS. \\"Our company's internal policies forbid illegal marketing activities\\" a company official said. \\"JTI Korea strictly observes all relevant domestic laws in our business affairs\\". === Controversy over using tobacco leaves near Fukushima === There has been a controversy online about the spread of rumors that Mild Seven is manufacturing tobacco leaves near the Fukushima nuclear plant accident in Japan. Some have suggested that Mild Seven changed its name to Mevius in order to avoid such suspicion. However, the controversy was overcome by JTI Korea 's official statement that \\"Mevius does not use Japanese tobacco at all\\" ==Sport sponsorshipFormula 1=== The Renault R23 with Mild Seven sponsorship, driven by Jarno Trulli at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during the 2003 F1 Season. Japan Tobacco was, through Mild Seven, the title sponsor of the Benetton Formula One team beginning with the 1994 Formula One season. This association continued after Benetton was acquired by Renault. It was to remain with Renault F1 until the end of the 2009 Formula One season, but due to European Tobacco Regulations, the company had to end their association with Renault at the end of the 2006 Formula One season and ING became their main sponsor from 2007 onwards. Next to Benetton and Renault, Mild Seven sponsored both Tyrrell Racing, from 1994 to 1996, and Minardi in 1997 as a result of a sponsorship deal with Japanese driver Ukyo Katayama. ===Other sports=== At the end of the 1990s to early 2000s, Japanese tobacco companies were not allowed to advertise their products in China due to the still lingering tensions of World War II. So Japan Tobacco decided to hold an \\"Eco-challenge\\" style adventure race ‚Äì sponsored by Mild Seven cigarettes. Thus was born the \\"Mild Seven Outdoor Quest\\". Dan Morris was the official photographer for this event from 1997-2001. This event took him to a number of beautiful spots in Western China including Dali City, Lijiang and Xijiang (home of the Chinese space program). Top athletes such as Team Eco-Internet, Mike Pigg and Paula Newby- Fraser would regularly compete in this event. In 2001, Mild Seven was the official sponsor of the \\"Mild Seven Pool Challenge\\". ==Marketing== During the 1980s and 1990s, JTI created various TV advertisements to promote Mild Seven cigarettes, both in English and Japanese. Various poster advertisements were also made to advertise both Mild Seven and Mevius cigarettes.

It was founded in 1972. The Denver Center for the Performing Arts is the largest tenant of the Denver Performing Arts Complex which is a four-block, site containing ten performance spaces with over 10,000 seats. It is owned and partially operated by Arts and Venues Denver. Both organizations were the vision of Donald Seawell. Finding himself at 14th and Curtis streets in downtown Denver one day and looking at the old Auditorium Theatre and the surrounding four blocks, Seawell had an idea for a first-class arts complex. Seawells original vision was much broader and included other entities (see Previous Entities below) which no longer are part of the Center. Ground was broken in December 1974. By 1978 Boettcher Concert Hall ‚Äî the nation's first in-the-round concert hall ‚Äî was completed, along with an eight-story, 1,700-space parking garage. By 1979 the Auditorium Theatre had been renovated (and was completely renovated again in 2005, creating the state-of-the-art Ellie Caulkins Opera House inside of the historic Auditorium), two cabaret spaces had been added and the Helen G. Bonfils Theatre Complex opened with its four theatres: The Stage, Space, Source (now Jones) and Ricketson. The Temple Hoyne Buell Theatre was completed in 1991, the Seawell Grand Ballroom was added in 1998 and The Conservatory Theatre opened in 2002. ==Entities of the DCPA== The Denver Center for the Performing Arts is currently the largest tenant of the Denver Performing Arts Complex. The Denver Center organizes, oversees, and presents work by the following entities: *The Denver Center Theatre Company (DCTC) was created in 1979 as the region's largest resident, professional theatre company. Under the leadership of Edward Payson Call (1979 to 1983), Donovan Marley (1984 to 2005) and Kent Thompson (2005 to the present), the Theatre Company has created an impressive body of classic and contemporary drama and world premieres. In acknowledgment of this work, the DCTC received the 1998 Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theatre. Stage director Israel Hicks took on the challenge posed by Donovan Marley and directed August Wilson's entire 10-play Pittsburgh Cycle over a two-decade period starting in 1990.Weber, Bruce. \\"Israel Hicks, Director of August Wilson‚Äôs Cycle, Dies at 66\\", The New York Times, July 7, 2010. Accessed July 8, 2010. *Denver Center Attractions (DCA) was created by Robert Garner, presenter of national touring companies since 1961, and joined the Center in 1979. When Garner retired in 1992, his hand- picked successor was Randy Weeks (DCPA president and executive director of DCA until his unexpected death in 2014). Center Attractions presents Broadway touring shows and its impressive attendance record has made Denver a \\"pick\\" city. Disney selected Denver Center Attractions to host its pre-Broadway debut of The Little Mermaid, plus Disney's The Lion King, August: Osage County, Sunset Boulevard and the revival of Hello, Dolly starring Carol Channing among many others have chosen Denver to launch their national tours. DCA also produces cabaret including the original Denver-based comedy, Girls Only: The Secret Comedy of Women, and I Love You, You‚Äôre Perfect, Now Change, which ran for more than four years making it Denver's longest-running musical. *The Denver Center‚Äôs Education Department was started in October 1984 when the DCPA and the American National Theatre and Academy joined together to establish the National Theatre Conservatory, a three-year graduate acting program. The NTC will be phased out by 2012. The Denver Center Theatre Academy was added in 1991 as a community school for children and adults in a professional setting. *The Seawell Grand Ballroom is a facility with a maximum capacity of 1,029 people. This pentagonal shaped room with panoramic views of the mountains can accommodate a variety of functions and features its own catering kitchen, freight elevator, tables, chairs, portable dance floor, movable platform staging and a state-of-the-art lighting, audio, video and projection systems. Epicurean Culinary Group is the exclusive caterer for the Ballroom. *Previous Entities which have since left the DCPA include Denver Center Media and Wilber James Gould Voice Center (a consortium member of the National Center for Voice and Speech). Denver Center Media was a full-service video and film production studio, was established in 1983 and received numerous international awards and Emmys for television production, direction and sound design. DCM productions have been broadcast nationally on PBS, cable and overseas networks. Productions include Top of the World, Colcannon, The Moscow String Quartet: At Play in America, Coors Field: Home at Last, Pamoja: A Coming Together and Memory of a Large Christmas. The Gould Voice Center was founded in 1983 and headed, until his death in 1994, by the noted otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould and afterwards by world known speech scientist Ingo R. Titze. It was the only such facility in the world that is part of a performing arts organization. While these entities, along with the other entities, were at the DCPA, the entire conglomerate was unique in the world. ==See also== List of concert halls #Temple Hoyne Buell Theatre ‚Äî 2,880 seats #Ellie Caulkins Opera House ‚Äî 2,225 seats #Seawell Grand Ballroom ‚Äî 1,095 capacity #Stage Theatre ‚Äî 750 seats #Space Theatre ‚Äî 550 seats #Ricketson Theatre ‚Äî 250 seats #Garner Galleria Theatre ‚Äî 210 seats #Jones Theatre ‚Äî 200 seats #Conservatory Theatre ‚Äî 185 seats ==References External links == * * * National Theatre Conservatory Category:Theatre in Colorado Category:Regional theatre in the United States Category:Organizations based in Denver Category:1972 establishments in Colorado ","title":"Denver Center for the Performing Arts"},{"id":"2208741","text":"Being Eve is a television series from New Zealand, originally shown on TV3 from 2001‚Äì2002, and rebroadcast on Noggin's teen block The N.

It can be seen as a branch of civil engineering or structural engineering but just on a very large land area. In particular, macro-engineering is the process of marshaling and managing of resources, technology and public opinion on a large scale to carry out complex tasks that last over a long period. In contrast to conventional engineering projects, macro-engineering projects (called macro-projects or mega-projects) are multidisciplinary, involving collaboration from all fields of study; they involve not only engineers, but scientists, lawyers, industrialists, soldiers and politicians as well. Macro-projects are usually international; they override political boundaries because most countries lack the social, financial or physical ability to undertake them alone. As a consequence, macro-projects have the power to fundamentally transform their areas of focus. Macro-engineering is an evolving field that is only recently receiving attention. Because we routinely deal with challenges that are multinational in scope, such as global warming and pollution, macro-engineering is emerging as a transcendent solution to worldwide problems. Macro-engineering, or mega- engineering, is distinct from megascale engineering which deals with projects on a planetary or stellar scale. Where macro-engineering is currently practical, mega-scale engineering is still within the domain of speculative fiction. ==In reality== Past macro-projects include the construction of the Panama Canal and Suez Canal, the Channel Tunnel and the planned Gibraltar Tunnel, the construction of cross-country oil pipelines, and most recently, a multinational effort to standardize satellite communication. Two intellectual centers focused on macro-engineering theory and practice are the Candida Oancea Institute in Bucharest, Romania, and The Center for Macro Projects and Diplomacy at Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island, United States. ==See also== * Afforestation * Agroforestry * Atlantropa (Gibraltar Dam) * Analog forestry * Bering Strait bridge * Buffer strip * Biomass * Biomass (ecology) * Climate engineering (Geoengineering) * Collaborative innovation network * Deforestation * Deforestation during the Roman period * Ecological engineering * Ecological engineering methods * Ecotechnology * Energy-efficient landscaping * Forest gardening * Forest farming * Great Plains Shelterbelt * Green Wall of China * IBTS Greenhouse * Home gardens * Human ecology * Permaculture * Permaforestry * Proposed sahara forest project * Qattara Depression Project * Red Sea dam * Sand fence * Seawater Greenhouse * Sustainable agriculture * Terraforming * Windbreak * Wildcrafting ==References== * Frank P.

It absorbs approximately 99.6% of visible light at normal incidence, while conventional black paint absorbs about 97.5%. At other angles of incidence, super black is even more effective: at an angle of 45¬∞, it absorbs 99.9% of light. ==Technology== The technology to create super black involves chemically etching a nickel‚Äìphosphorus alloy. Applications of super black are in specialist optical instruments for reducing unwanted reflections. The disadvantage of this material is its low optical thickness, as it is a surface treatment. As a result, infrared light of a wavelength longer than a few micrometers penetrates through the dark layer and has much higher reflectivity. The reported spectral dependence increases from about 1% at 3 ¬µm to 50% at 20 ¬µm. In 2009, a competitor to the super black material, Vantablack, was developed based on carbon nanotubes. It has a relatively flat reflectance in a wide spectral range. In 2011, NASA and the US Army began funding research in the use of nanotube-based super black coatings in sensitive optics.Nanostructured Super-Black Optical Materials 10/23/2013 Nanotube-based superblack arrays and coatings have recently become commercially available. ==See also== * Emissivity * Black hole * Black body ==References* * Category:Materials science Category:Optics Category:Shades of black ","title":"Super black"},{"id":"2208749","text":"Portrait by Allan Warren, 1983 Arms of the Dukes of Sutherland (Egerton family) John Sutherland Egerton, 6th Duke of Sutherland, (10 May 1915 ‚Äì 21 September 2000) was a British peer from the Egerton family. He was styled Viscount Brackley until 1944 when he became the 5th Earl of Ellesmere on inheriting his father's substantive title and inherited his ducal title in 1963 from a distant cousin. ==Background and education== The son of John Egerton, 4th Earl of Ellesmere and Lady Violet Lambton, he was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He travelled to France with the British Expeditionary Force and was captured at St Valery in 1940. He spent four years in a prisoner of war camp. Upon his return in 1944, he succeeded his father as Earl of Ellesmere. ==Career== In 1963, George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland, his distant cousin 'Geordie', died, leaving no immediate male heir. Egerton succeeded to the dukedom, but did not inherit the Sutherland estates or Dunrobin Castle, which went to Elizabeth Janson, Geordie's niece, who became the Countess of Sutherland. Estate duty forced the Duke to sell many pieces from the family's renowned collection of paintings and drawings. The family's wealth had shifted from landholdings to an estimated ¬£120m collection of paintings which included Raphaels, Titians, Tintorettos, Poussins, and a large part of the famous Orl√©ans collection from the Palais Royal in Paris. The wealth had come from the acquisitions of the third Duke of Bridgewater, who built the famous canal and passed on his mining riches, and from intermarriage. Benjamin Disraeli once paid tribute to the family's \\"talent for absorbing heiresses\\". Despite the hundreds of paintings the Duke was forced to sell, he retained the Dutch masters for Mertoun. The Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh had a number of notable paintings in its possession on long-term loan from the Duke of Sutherland's estate, including pieces by Titian, El Greco, Raphael and van Dyck (one of which, the Venus Anadyomene, was bought by the gallery after his death towards inheritance tax). The Duke made it clear, by selling Bridgewater House in London, that he was abandoning metropolitan pursuits. He maintained the family horse racing tradition. A Conservative, he took his seat in the Lords in 1945, but eschewed his right to vote or speak for more than half a century.HL Deb (6 December 1945) vol. 138. col. 401. Retrieved 7 January 2020. He did find his political voice as a Berwickshire county councillor. The sixth duke kept a very local profile. In 1984 he sold four masterpieces to fund improving his garden for opening to the public. In 1994 he disagreed when the National Gallery of Scotland sought to rehouse some of his paintings in a new gallery in Glasgow, preferring them to be dispersed around Scotland. ==Family== Sutherland married Lady Diana Percy (23 November 1917 ‚Äì 16 June 1978), daughter of Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, on 29 April 1939.

It is named after Saint Margaret, wife of King Malcolm III of Scotland. Its predecessor, Queen Margaret University College, was awarded full university status becoming Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh in January 2007. ==History== The University was founded in 1875, as The Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy, by Christian Guthrie Wright and Louisa Stevenson, both members of the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association. The School was founded as a women-only institution, with twin aims of improving women's access to higher education and improving the diets of working class families. Teaching was initially delivered via lectures at the Royal Museum, supplemented by a programme of public lectures and demonstrations delivered nationwide, but in 1877 the School established a base at Shandwick Place, in Haymarket. The school moved in 1891 to Atholl Crescent, expanding its courses and offering residential places to students. In 1909, the School was designated a Central Institution and brought under the public control of the Scottish Education Department. The first Principal appointed was Ethel De la Cour.Tom Begg, ‚ÄòCour, Ethel Maud De la (1869‚Äì1957)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, OUP, 2004 accessed 11 April 2007 De la Cour retired in 1930, and in the same year the School became the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science. In 1961, the College acquired its Corstorphine campus, purchasing a portion of the Clermiston estate from developers. The campus was first occupied by the College in 1970, opened by Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester who was Patron of the institution until her death in 2004. In 1972, the name Queen Margaret College was adopted to dissociate the College from the narrow field of domestic science. Thereafter, the College broadened its range of courses, especially in the dramatic arts and paramedical healthcare fields. The following institutions have since been absorbed by Queen Margaret College: * The Edinburgh College of Speech and Drama (established 1929, joined 1971) * The Edinburgh School of Speech Therapy (established 1946, joined 1975) * The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh School of Physiotherapy (established 1940, joined 1978) * The Astley Ainslie Hospital Occupational Therapy Training Centre (established 1937, joined 1979) * The Edinburgh Foot Clinic and School of Chiropody (established 1924, joined 1984) * The Edinburgh School of Radiography (established 1936, joined 1992) * The Edinburgh University Settlement School of Art Therapy (established 1992, joined 1997) Musselburgh campus, Queen Margaret University. In 1992, the Privy Council granted Queen Margaret College powers to award its own taught degrees, and in 1998, the College was granted full degree powers, which enabled it to award its own research and higher degrees. As a result, in 1999 the College took the name Queen Margaret University College. After the University College attained the final criteria of acquiring a minimum of 5000 students (something that could not be gained earlier as the campuses could not accommodate this number of students), the institution was awarded full university status, becoming Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh in January 2007.QM relocates In 2012, QMU became the first university in Scotland to have a Business Gateway on campus. Scotland‚Äôs First Minister, Alex Salmond announced in May 2010 that QMU was to be the official host of the archives for Homecoming Scotland 2009. The Homecoming Scotland Archive will provide the University with a unique opportunity to collect, catalogue and preserve materials associated with Scottish Homecoming 2009 for the benefit of people in both Scotland and across the world. ==CampusesFormer campuses=== Before moving to a new campus in Musselburgh, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh had been based in campuses in Corstorphine (to the West of Edinburgh), in Leith, and at the Gateway Theatre ‚Äì Scotland's International Drama Centre ‚Äì (a former television studio previously owned by Scottish Television) on Elm Row, Leith Walk. ===Musselburgh campus=== Student accommodation at the Musselburgh campus. In 2007-2008, the university brought together students from its three campuses in Edinburgh by moving to a new purpose-built campus in Musselburgh, East Lothian. Costing ¬£100 million, the new campus covers and holds educational buildings, a students union, a small gym and halls of residence of more than 800 rooms. QMU has been \\"touted as the country's greenest University campus\\". The campus was designed by Dyer Architects to exceed current environmental standards and sets a new benchmark in sustainable design. The entire development transformed a site from low-grade farmland into landscaped parkland. In June 2015, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh announced it would hold public consultations for plans to build a new innovation park and shopping hub on open land around the Musselburgh campus. Site proposals are being developed by CAM-SCI, a Cambridge-based economic consultancy, which has developed science parks across the UK. Learning Resource Centre The Learning Resource Centre (LRC) comprises approximately of the main academic building. Located at the heart of the campus, it provides library, IT and AV services to students, staff and visitors of the university. The LRC consists of a facility for both directed and self-directed study, based on an integrated library and information service provision. The LRC has 1,000 study spaces organised as a mixture of silent and group study areas, bookable group study rooms, training rooms, assistive technology, student learning support and a postgraduate study room. Education Resource Centre The Education Resource Centre provides audio-visual services to the university. This includes the provision of AV equipment in classrooms and lecture theatres as well as more specialised services such as graphics, photography, video- conferencing and TV studio facilities. ==OrganisationSchool of Arts and Social Sciences === Following restructuring in early 2010, the Schools of Social Sciences, Media and Communication, Business, Enterprise and Management, and Drama and Creative Industries were merged. The present Dean is Professor Brigid Daniel. The School offers courses in 'Business, Enterprise and Management'; 'Governance, Justice and Public Management'; 'Hospitality and Gastronomy'; Creativity and Culture'; and 'Public Relations' . QMU is part of the Scottish Drama Training Network which was set up by the Scottish Funding Council in 2010 to foster cohesion across stage and screen professional practice, education and training. Through the Network, QMU in partnership with Edinburgh Napier University delivers the BA (Hons) Acting for Stage and Screen. The School is the only institution in Scotland that is accredited by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations to deliver the postgraduate CIPR Diploma in Public Relations. The School's Bachelor of Science (BSc) courses in psychology; MSc in Health Psychology are accredited by the British Psychological Society. BA (Hons) in Media graduate, Agata Jagodzinska, was awarded for Best Writer at the BAFTA in Scotland New Talent Awards 2012. It is also only one of three places in Scotland to offer a degree in Costume. ===School of Health Sciences=== The School of Health Sciences offers courses in dietetics, nutrition and biological sciences; nursing; speech and language therapy, audiology, occupational therapy and art therapy; physiotherapy; podiatry; radiography; art psychotherapy, dance movement psychotherapy and music therapy. The subject area of Speech and Hearing Sciences won the Queen's Anniversary Prize for research into the clinical applications of speech technology in 2002 carried out in the Speech Science Research Centre. ===Governance=== In October 2016, celebrity chef Prue Leith became Chancellor, succeeding Sir Tom Farmer. Sir Paul Grice assumed the role of Principal and Vice Chancellor in October 2019. He was Chief Executive and Clerk of the Scottish Parliament prior to his appointment at Queen Margaret University succeeding Professor Petra Wend. Petra Wend joined Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, as Principal and Vice-Chancellor in September 2009. She originally read Italian and French Language and Literature, and Education at the University of M√ºnster in Germany and gained a PhD in Italian Language and Literature at University of Leeds. Following a series of positions at UK universities, she joined Oxford Brookes University as Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and Deputy Chief Executive in 2005. She retired from her position in 2019. ==Academic profileRankings and reputation=== In June 2012 the management team at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, was presented with the Times Higher Education Leadership and Management Team Award. QMU won the e-Government National Award 2010 in the category for sustainable, ‚Äògreen IT‚Äô or ‚Äòcarbon-efficient‚Äô services. In autumn 2010 it picked up gold at the Scottish Green Awards, and in 2009 it won an award for a waste management project, as well as a Green Apple Award. ===Research=== The university has three flagships: health and rehabilitation; creativity and culture; and sustainable business. Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, has seven research centres: * Centre for Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research * Centre for Applied Social Sciences * Centre for Person-centred Practice Research * Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language Research Centre * Institute for Global Health and Development * Centre for Communication, Cultural and Media Studies * Scottish Centre for Food Development and Innovation The University operates an open access repository of the research output of the university, called eResearch, with the intention of making the work of researchers open and available to the public via the web. Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, researchers in food and drink in partnerships with Advanced Microwave Technologies Ltd (AMT), won two major awards for innovation and partnership in 2012 for their collaboration to explore the application of microwave technologies to the food and drink sector. ==Notable alumniReferencesExternal links== * Queen Margaret University official website *Queen Margaret University open access research repository *Students' Union Category:Educational institutions established in 2007 Category:19th century in Scotland Category:Education in East Lothian Category:2007 establishments in Scotland Category:Drama schools in Scotland Category:Musselburgh Category:Universities established in the 2000s Category:Universities UK ","title":"Queen Margaret University"},{"id":"2208781","text":"Maharees or Magharees () is a 5 km long tombolo located on the northern side of the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland.

The peninsula is a sandy spit for much of its length, with sand dunes giving way to earth and rocky ground towards the northern end. The sand dunes create a unique ecosystem, home to the rare Natterjack toad which is found locally in significant quantities. Lengthy beaches are found on both sides of the peninsula, which separates Brandon Bay on the western side from Tralee Bay to the east. The Brandon Bay beaches are open to the North Atlantic and often receive long rolling swells, which can provide excellent surf given suitable wind and tide conditions. The peninsula is dotted with campgrounds and caravan parks and contains three hamlets, Fahamore, Kilshannig, and Candeehy, which are home to local pubs and restaurants popular with visitors to the area. Castlegregory Golf and Fishing club is a nine-hole links golf course located at the base of the peninsula, and a 5-star PADI certified dive centre is located at the fishing harbour at Scraggane Bay. Several windsurfing and surf schools are also located at the beaches on the Maharees. Maheree Island Tours and Angling is based at Scraggane Pier.

His family derived their name from their estates at Nagyk√°ll√≥, in Szabolcs, and claimed descent from the Balogh Semsen tribe, which had settled the area of the historical Borsod County, Szabolcs County, and Szatm√°r County in the late 9th century. They played a prominent part in Hungarian history as early as the reign of King Coloman (1070‚Äì1116); and from King Matthias Corvinus (1458‚Äì1490) they received their estates at Mez≈ët√∫r, near Kecskem√©t, granted to Mih√°ly K√°llay for his heroic defense of Jajce in Bosnia. Stephan von K√°llay, Benjamin's father, a superior official of the Hungarian government, died in 1845, and his widow, who survived until 1902, devoted herself to the education of her five-year-old son. Amalie von K√°llay n√©e Bla≈°koviƒá de Ebetske, was of Serbian descent. She took over the care of K√°llay's education and directed his interest to Slavic studies in general and particularly to Serbian history. She spoke Serbian and it is very likely that her son heard some of her reminiscences relating to the country of her ancestors. She engaged an excellent teacher in the person of Mih√°ly T√°ncsics, a well-known populist tribune and revolutionary writer of Serb and Slovak descent, who was once imprisoned by the Austrians for seditious writings in 1847‚Äì48 and again in 1860 (the same Buda jail that Lajos Kossuth was incarcerated from 1837‚Äì40). At an early age K√°llay manifested a deep interest in politics, and especially in the Eastern Question. He traveled in Russia, European Turkey and Asia Minor, gaining a thorough knowledge of Greek, Turkish, and several Slavic languages. He became as proficient in Serbian as in his native tongue. ==Career== In 1867 he entered the Diet of Hungary as Conservative deputy for M√ºhlbach (Sz√°szsebes); in 1869 he was appointed consul-general at Belgrade, and in 1872 he visited the Vilayet of Bosnia for the first time. His views on Balkan questions strongly influenced Count Andr√°ssy, the Austro-Hungarian minister for foreign affairs. Leaving Belgrade in 1875, he resumed his seat in the Diet, and shortly afterward founded the journal Kelet N√©pe, or People of the East, in which he defended the vigorous policy of Andr√°ssy. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1878 he went to Plovdiv (modern Bulgaria) as Austro-Hungarian envoy extraordinary on the International Eastern Rumelian Commission. In 1879, he became second, and soon afterward first, departmental chief at the foreign office in Vienna. On 4 June 1882. he was appointed Austro-Hungarian minister of finance and administrator of the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the distinction with which he filled this office, for a period of 21 years, is his chief title of fame. K√°llay was an honorary member of the Budapest and Vienna academies of science, and attained some eminence as a writer. He translated John Stuart Mill's On Liberty into Hungarian, adding an introductory critique; while his version of Galatea, a play by the Greek dramatist Spiridion N. Basiliades (1843‚Äì1874), proved successful on the Hungarian stage. His monographs on Serbian history (Geschichte der Serben) was translated into Serbian by Gavrilo Vitkoviƒá, and on the Oriental ambition of Russia (Die Orientpolitik Russlands) was translated into German by J. H. Schwicker and published at Leipzig in 1878. But in his own opinion, his masterpiece was an academic oration on the political and geographical position of Hungary as a link between East and West. ==Personal life== In 1873, K√°llay married the Countess Vilma Bethlen de Bethlen. They had three surviving daughters and a son: * M√°rta K√°llay de Nagy- K√°ll√≥ (1875‚Äì1891) * Frigyes K√°llay de Nagy-K√°ll√≥ (1877‚Äì1944) ‚ö≠ Baroness Elisabeth Vay de Vaya (1877‚Äì1922); had issue ‚ö≠ Maria K√∂ver de Gyergy√≥szentmikl√≥s (b. 1880) 1\\\\.

The station is owned by Costa de Oro Media, LLC, under the operation of Entravision Communications' chief executive officer Walter Ulloa (whose brother, Ronald Ulloa, owns Rancho Palos Verdes-licensed ethnic independent station KXLA (channel 44) and Twentynine Palms-licensed KVMD (channel 31)). KJLA's studios are located on Corinth Avenue (near Interstate 405) in West Los Angeles, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson. KJLA operates two low-power repeater stations: KLFA-LD (channel 25) in Santa Maria and KFUL-LD (channel 44) in San Luis Obispo (both are part of the Santa Barbara market). In addition to carrying Spanish-language programming on its main channel, the station also carries various networks broadcasting in Vietnamese and Mandarin on separate digital subchannels. ==History== The station first signed on the air on October 1, 1990 as KSTV-TV. It was the second attempt to operate a television station in Ventura; the first, KKOG-TV (channel 16), operated from December 14, 1968 to September 13, 1969, with a schedule of entirely live, local programming. KSTV-TV was originally owned by Costa de Oro Television, Inc., and originally aired Spanish-language programming as an affiliate of Galavisi√≥n. The station signed on a low-power translator in Santa Maria in 1992. In 1994, Walter Ulloa purchased Costa de Oro Television and KSTV-TV, intending to increase its transmitting power and extend its signal to better reach to the Los Angeles area. However, although Ventura is considered part of the Los Angeles market, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules at the time placed KSTV-TV within the Santa Barbara‚ÄìSanta Maria‚ÄìSan Luis Obispo market, similar to the situation of KADY- TV channel 63 (now KBEH-TV) in Oxnard, California which became Santa Barbara's UPN affiliate when the network launched in January 1995. Unable to get cable coverage in the Los Angeles area, on November 1, 1995, KSTV switched to an English-language format and became the WB affiliate for the Santa Barbara market. Logo for \\"LATV\\", the bilingual programming block produced by KJLA. However, the station continued in its attempts to enter the Los Angeles market. In July 1997, KSTV increased its effective radiated power to 5,000 kilowatts. The improved signal helped the station to obtain must-carry status on most cable providers in western Los Angeles County in February 1998. However, because Los Angeles already had a WB-affiliated station, KTLA (channel 5), KSTV-TV was forced to disaffiliate from the network. In the spring of 1998, the station relocated its studios and offices from Ventura to West Los Angeles. The station changed its call letters to KJLA on July 20, 1998, to further reflect its intentions to serve the Los Angeles market. On that date, KJLA became an independent station and adopted a split-scheduled format. The station began carrying financial news programming under the brand Business News 22 acquired from KWHY-TV, later BizNews 1 on weekday mornings and afternoons. Business news returned to KWHY-TV, this time only on its digital signal, in 2000, and was later dropped by KJLA. In November 2001, the Simi Valley translator was moved to Mount Wilson and started broadcasting to Los Angeles as KSMV-LP on channel 33. Ironically, the original low power translator in Simi Valley operated on channel 44, which caused interference with full power \\"cousin\\" station KRPA (now KXLA) which prompted the change to channel 33. Soon after, Trinity Broadcasting Network sought to move KTBN-TV's digital operation from channel 23 to channel 33, to avoid co-channel interference from the digital signals of KVMD (another \\"cousin\\" of KJLA) in the Inland Empire and San Diego CW affiliate XETV, now a repeater of XHGC-TDT. KTBN's move to channel 33 was authorized on February 5, 2009, ultimately displacing KSMV-LP to KTBN's former digital channel, 23. KSMV-LP soon flash- cut to digital and started rebroadcasting KVMD to the Los Angeles area. The following year in 2001, the station began branding its Spanish language programming block under the name LATV. In April 2007, LATV transitioned from a programming block on KJLA into a national network; it became distributed to several television stations (mainly carried on digital subchannels and low- power stations, with the subchannels of four stations owned by Post-Newsweek Stations and those owned by Entravision Communications among the network's charter affiliates).http://www.latv.com/sales/articles/PNewswekkStations.html In December 2017, it was announced that the station will become the Los Angeles market's Azteca Am√©rica affiliate on January 3, 2018, replacing KAZA- TV, thus KVMD became the new affiliate of LATV in the Los Angeles market on January 1, 2018. Although the official switch to Azteca was not until January 3, the station started airing the majority of the network's programming on January 1 with an exception of shows that aired at the same time as KJLA's religious programming, which continued to air on the network until March.https://www.mediamoves.com/2018/01/azteca-america-latv-switch-channels- la.html Various Azteca programs were delayed or not shown at all in order to make place for KJLA's religious program Cambia Tu Vida, which aired various times a day. The program was removed from KJLA's schedule on March 19, 2018, and the station now airs Azteca's entire schedule \\"live\\" and in pattern. ==Digital televisionDigital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - !

The higher operating costs were in part due to KJLA having two different transmitter sites. The station's channel 57 analog transmitter was located on South Mountain near Santa Paula in Ventura County; the facilities for its channel 49 digital signal are located on Mount Wilson in Los Angeles County.\\"Request to Discontinue Analog Operations of Station KJLA(TV)\\", Federal Communications Commission, Mar 10, 2005. KJLA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 57, on August 27, 2008.List of Digital Full-Power Stations The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using PSIP to display KJLA's virtual channel as 57 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. KJLA is the second television station in the Los Angeles market to discontinue its analog signal, after KVMD, which shut down its analog signal in 2003. Channel sharing trial In February 2014, KJLA and PBS member station KLCS (channel 58) were granted special temporary authority by the FCC to conduct trials in partnership with CTIA and the Association of Public Television Stations, in which the two stations would conduct a test of the H.264 video codec for digital television transmission, and more importantly, the ability and viability of broadcasting two sets of television services within the same 6 MHz channel band. These tests came as the FCC prepared to perform a spectrum auction in 2015 (which was delayed to sometime in 2016 that November), in which television station operators would be able to voluntarily sell their broadcast spectrum to the government, and then receive profits from its sale to wireless providers. An FCC spokesperson stated that channel sharing would allow broadcasters to \\"[take] advantage of the incentive auction‚Äôs once-in-a-lifetime financial opportunity\\", while still maintaining its ability to run over-the-air television programming. == References www.latv.com * * * Santa Barbara TV Guide channel listings showing KSTV affiliations in 1992 and 1997. * 1995 FCC petition requesting cable carriage under must-carry rules. * 1998 FCC petition requesting modification of market under must-carry rules. * 2000 FCC petition requesting cable carriage. * USENET posting referring to KSTV-57 and WB affiliation * TV57 description on R-VCR.COM * Orange Bytes, November 1999 article announcing move of KWHY-TV business news JLA JLA Category:Television channels and stations established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in California JLA ","title":"KJLA"},{"id":"2208811","text":"Luciano Andr√© Pagliarini Mendon√ßa (born April 18, 1978 in Arapongas, state of Paran√°) is a retired Brazilian cyclist.

The name tetrazole also refers to the parent compound with formula CH2N4, of which three isomers can be formulated. == Structure and bonding == Three isomers of the parent tetrazole exist, differing in the position of the double bonds: 1H-, 2H-, and 5H-tetrazole. The 1H- and 2H- isomers are tautomers, with the equilibrium lying on the side of 1H-tetrazole in the solid phase.Razynska, A.; Tempczyk, A.; Malinski, E.; Szafranek, J.; Grzonka, Z.; Hermann, P.: in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2 1983, 379. In the gas phase, 2H-tetrazole dominates. These isomers can be regarded as aromatic, with 6 œÄ-electrons, while the 5H-isomer is nonaromatic. Tautomerization of 1H-tetrazole (left) and 2H-tetrazole (middle) in comparison to 5H-tetrazole (right) ==Synthesis== 1H-Tetrazole was first prepared by the reaction of anhydrous hydrazoic acid and hydrogen cyanide under pressure. Treatment of organic nitriles with sodium azide in the presence of iodine or silica-supported sodium bisulfate as a heterogeneous catalyst enables an advantageous synthesis of 5-substituted 1H-tetrazoles. Another method is the deamination of 5-aminotetrazole, which can be commercially obtained or prepared in turn from aminoguanidine. :900px 2-Aryl-2H-tetrazoles are synthesized by a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between an aryl diazonium and trimethylsilyldiazomethane. ==Uses == There are several pharmaceutical agents which are tetrazoles. Tetrazoles can act as bioisosteres for carboxylate groups because they have similar pKa and are deprotonated at physiological pH. Angiotensin II receptor blockers ‚Äî such as losartan and candesartan, often are tetrazoles. A well-known tetrazole is dimethyl thiazolyl diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). This tetrazole is used in the MTT assay to quantify the respiratory activity of live cells culture, although it generally kills the cells in the process. Some tetrazoles can also be used in DNA assays. Studies suggest VT-1161 and VT-1129 are a potential potent antifungal drugs as they disturbs fungal enzymatic function but not human enzymes. Some tetrazole derivatives with high energy have been investigated as high performance explosives as a replacement for TNT and also for use in high performance solid rocket propellant formulations. These include the azidotetrazolate salts of nitrogen bases. Other tetrazoles are used for their explosive or combustive properties, such as tetrazole itself and 5-aminotetrazole, which are sometimes used as a component of gas generators in automobile airbags. Tetrazole based energetic materials produce high- temperature, non-toxic reaction products such as water and nitrogen gas, and have a high burn rate and relative stability, all of which are desirable properties. The delocalization energy in tetrazole is 209 kJ/mol. 1H-Tetrazole and 5-(benzylthio)-1H-tetrazole (BTT) are widely used as acidic activators of the coupling reaction in oligonucleotide synthesis. ==Related heterocycles== * Triazoles, analogs with three nitrogen atoms * Pentazole, the analog with five nitrogen atoms (strictly speaking, an inorganic homocycle, not a heterocycle) * Oxatetrazole * Thiatetrazole ==References== Category:Simple aromatic rings Category:Nitrogen heterocycles Category:Azoles ","title":"Tetrazole"},{"id":"2208823","text":"Scraggane pier Scraggane () is a fishing port located on the Maharees peninsula near Castlegregory in County Kerry, Ireland.

He later joined the Baoding Military Academy () in Beijing and embarked on a career as a professional soldier. His talents as an officer were recognized by his superiors, and he rose quickly in the ranks. Wu joined the \\"New Army\\" () (renamed the Beiyang Army in 1902) created by modernizing Qing dynasty Gen. Yuan Shikai. Following the fall of the Qing in 1911, and after Yuan's rise to President of the Republic of China and his subsequent disastrous attempt to proclaim himself emperor, political power in China quickly devolved into the hands of various regional military authorities, inaugurating the era of warlordism. In 1915 Wu became commander of the 6th Brigade. == Zhili Clique == After Yuan's death in 1916, his Beiyang Army split into several mutually hostile factions that battled for supremacy over the following years. The major factions included Duan Qirui's Anhui clique, Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian clique, and Feng Guozhang's Zhili clique, of which Wu Peifu was a member. Duan Qirui's faction dominated politics in Beijing from 1916-20 but was forced to maintain an uneasy relationship with Feng Guozhang's faction to maintain stability. The two clashed over methods of dealing with the restive south, with Duan pushing for military conquest and Feng preferring negotiation. Feng died in 1919 and the leadership of the Zhili Clique was secured by Cao Kun with the support of Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang. Cao and Wu began to agitate against Duan and the Anhui clique and issued circular telegrams denouncing his collaboration with Japan. When they successfully pressured the president to dismiss Duan's key subordinate Gen. Xu Shuzheng, Duan began to prepare for war against the Zhili Clique. At this juncture, Cao Kun and Wu Peifu began to organize a wide-reaching alliance including all opponents of the Anhui clique. In November 1919 Wu Peifu met with representatives of Tang Jiyao and Lu Rongting (warlords of Yunnan and Guangxi, respectively) at Hengyang and signed a treaty titled ‚ÄúRough Draft of the National Salvation Allied Army‚Äù (), forming the base of the anti-Anhui clique alliance that also included Zhang Zuolin's powerful Fengtian clique. == Zhili-Anhui War == Wu Peifu with Gen. Ma Fuxiang. When hostilities finally broke out in July 1920, Wu Peifu took a prominent role as commander-in-chief of the anti-Anhui army. At first things did not go well for Zhili forces, as they were pushed back by Anhui troops across the front. However, Wu decided to execute a daring maneuver on the western end of the front by first outflanking enemy positions and then directly assaulting the enemy's headquarters position. The gambit paid off and Wu was rewarded with an astounding victory and the capture of many of the officers in the enemy command. The Anhui army crumbled within a week and Duan Qirui fled to the Japanese settlement at Tianjin. Wu Peifu was credited as the strategist behind the unexpectedly swift victory. In the aftermath of the conflict, the Zhili and Fengtian cliques agreed to a power-sharing coalition government. However, Zhang Zuolin, leader of the Fengtian clique, became increasingly uneasy with Wu Peifu's vehement anti-Japanese stance that threatened to upset the delicate arrangement Zhang had reached with the Japanese in his power base of Manchuria. Wu and Zhang also clashed over who would occupy the position of premier, replacing each other's choices with their own. Soon the coalition between Zhili and Fengtian broke down and hostilities were inevitable. == First Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War == In this war Wu Peifu was again placed in the position of commander-in-chief of Zhili forces. Fighting would take place on a broad front south of Beijing and Tianjin and lasted from April to June 1922. Initially, the Zhili army again suffered several setbacks against the well-equipped Fengtian army. Yet once again, Wu Peifu's leadership and planning turned the tide in favor of the Zhili clique. He executed several outflanking maneuvers that forced the western front of the Fengtian army back towards Beijing, then he lured it into a trap by feigning retreat. The result was the annihilation of the western wing of the Fengtian army, making its more successful eastern operations untenable. Zhang Zuolin was forced to order a general retreat towards Shanhaiguan, thereby ceding control of the capital to Wu and the Zhili clique. Victorious, Cao Kun and Wu Peifu's Zhili clique nevertheless took control of a government whose control over the provinces had greatly deteriorated. Manchuria was now de facto independent under Zhang Zuolin and the still formidable Fengtian clique, while the south was divided among myriad warlord armies, including remnants of the Anhui clique and Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang. == Control of the Beijing Government == The new government in Beijing was supported by Great Britain and the United States. Li Yuanhong, the last president with any legitimacy, was recalled to sit as president again on June 12, 1922; however, any cabinet member had to be cleared by Wu Peifu. By this time Wu's prestige and fame had far surpassed that of his former mentor Cao Kun, nominally head of the Zhili clique. This strained their relationship, although it did not result in a fracture of the Zhili clique. Wu tried to restrain Cao when the latter began political machinations for the presidency but ultimately could not prevent Cao from toppling the cabinet and impeaching Li. Cao then spent several months campaigning for the presidency and even openly declared he would pay $5000 to any parliamentarian who would cast a vote for him. This caused national condemnation against the Zhili clique but did not prevent Cao from being elected in October 1923. In 1923 Wu ruthlessly broke a strike at the important Hankou‚ÄìBeijing railway by sending in troops to violently suppress the workers and their leaders. The soldiers killed 35 workers and injured many more. Wu's reputation with the Chinese people suffered significantly because of this event, though he gained the favor of British and American business interests operating in China. Although it appeared that Zhili's power was secure for the time being, a crisis in the south soon precipitated another showdown with the Fengtian clique. The crisis was over the city of Shanghai, the commercial powerhouse of the nation. It was part of the province of Jiangsu, under Zhili control, but actually administered by Zhejiang, ruled by the remnants of the Anhui clique. When the Zhili clique demanded the return of Shanghai to their administration they were refused and fighting soon broke out. Zhang Zuolin in Manchuria and Sun Yat-sen, then in Guangdong, quickly declared their support for the Anhui clique and geared up for war. Wu Peifu dispatched his subordinate and prot√©g√© Sun Chuanfang to the south to deal with the Anhui clique and any attack that may have come from Sun's Kuomintang forces, while Wu himself prepared to face off again with Zhang's Fengtian army. == Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War == Now called the \\"Jade Marshal\\" (ÁéâÂ∏•) and generally acknowledged to be China's ablest strategist at the time, Wu Peifu was widely expected to win, and by doing so to finally put an end to various quasi- independent regional authorities. His warlord troops were some of the best trained and drilled in China, and as leader of the Zhili Clique, he almost continuously fought northern Chinese warlords like Zhang Zuolin. Known as the philosopher general, he was said at the time to own the world's largest diamond. Hundreds of thousands of men fought in this major battle between Zhang's Fengtian army and Wu's Zhili forces. At a key moment, one of Wu's chief allies, Feng Yuxiang, deserted the front, marched on Beijing and in the so-called Beijing Coup (Beijing zhengbian) overthrew the existing regime and proclaimed a new and mildly progressive government. Wu Peifu's military strategy was thrown into confusion by this catastrophe in his rear, and he was defeated by Zhang's forces near Tianjin. After the victory of the Fengtian clique, Duan Qirui was made the head of state and he proclaimed a provisional government. == Northern Expedition == Map of Northern Expedition; Wu Peifu's territory shown in purple Wu maintained a power base in Hubei and Henan in central China until he was confronted by the Kuomintang army during the Northern Expedition in 1927. With armies detained by Kuomintang allies in the Northwest, Wu was forced to withdraw to Zhengzhou in Henan. As Wu Peifu's armies were being overrun by the Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-shek, during a breakfast interview with a westerner Wu Peifu was noticed carrying an old book; the interviewer asked him the title, and Wu replied, \\"'The Military Campaigns of the Kingdom of Wu . . . They didn't have any machine guns or airplanes then.\\" Wu never held a political office during his years as a warlord. Wu Peifu hung a portrait of George Washington in his office. He was a nationalist, and refused to enter foreign concessions--not even to hide from his enemies--because he viewed them as an affront to China, and instead chose a much more perilous method of escape. ==Later years== After the second Sino- Japanese War broke out, Wu refused to cooperate with the Japanese. In 1939, when the Japanese invited him to be the leader of the puppet government in North China, Wu made a speech saying that he was willing to become the leader of North China again on behalf of the New Order in Asia, if every Japanese soldier on China's soil gave up his post and went back to Japan. He then went back into retirement. In December 1939, Wu had a tooth ache and went to see dentists to have it removed. However, he died of sepsis, a complication due to the dental extraction. Some claimed Wu was poisoned by Japanese. He was a national hero before he died, a status he had never before achieved.

AmSouth was previously known as First National Bank of Birmingham, which was first organized by Charles Linn in 1872. AmSouth was in the financial services industry and at its peak employed over twelve thousand people. AmSouth's size more than doubled in 2000 when it absorbed Nashville, Tennessee-based First American National Bank. With the merger came hundreds of branches primarily in Tennessee but also in Kentucky, Virginia, and Mississippi. This is cited as a rare example of one bank absorbing another bank larger than itself. As part of the deal, AmSouth also acquired Deposit Guaranty Bank (which was operating as a subsidiary of First American). AmSouth was known for its low risk accounts through its specialty in Wealth Management, especially in its largest market of Birmingham, Alabama, where it started its specialty. Following AmSouth's merger with First American in 1999, the company expanded its Wealth Management reach into many of First American's markets such as Nashville, Tennessee. == Merger with Regions Financial Corporation == On May 25, 2006, AmSouth announced it would merge with Regions Financial Corporation, another Birmingham-based bank, in a $10 billion deal.

European exploration of the area began in April 1540, with the Hernando de Soto expedition, who unwittingly introduced new Eurasian diseases that decimated the local Native American population, because they lacked any immunity. In 1663 the English Crown granted land to eight proprietors of what became the colony. The first settlers came to the Province of Carolina at the port of Charleston in 1670; they were mostly wealthy planters and their slaves coming from the English Caribbean colony of Barbados. They started to develop their commodity crops of sugar and cotton. Pushing back the Native Americans in the Yamasee War (1715‚Äì17), colonists next overthrew the proprietors' rule, seeing more direct representation. In 1719, the colony was officially made a crown colony; North Carolina was split off and made into a separate colony in 1729. In the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765, South Carolina banded together with the other colonies to oppose British taxation and played a major role in resisting Britain. It became independent in March 1776 and joined the United States of America.Walter Edgar, Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict that Turned the Tide of the American Revolution (2001) p. 34 The Revolution was bloody and hard-fought in 1780‚Äì81, as the British invaded, captured the American army and were finally driven out. In the early decades, the colony cultivated cotton on plantations of the sea islands and Low Country, along with rice, indigo and some tobacco as commodity crops, all worked by African slaves, most from West Africa. In the 19th century, invention of the cotton gin enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which grew better in the Piedmont than did long-staple cotton. The hilly upland areas, where landowners were generally subsistence farmers with few slaves, were much poorer; a regional conflict between the coastal and inland areas developed in the political system, long dominated by the Low Country planters. With outspoken leaders such as John C. Calhoun, the state vied with Virginia as the dominant political and social force in the South. It fought federal tariffs in the 1830s and demanded that its rights to practice slavery be recognized in newly established territories. With the 1860 election of Republicans under Abraham Lincoln, who vowed to prevent slavery's expansion, the voters demanded secession. In December 1860, the state seceded from the Union; in February 1861, it joined the new Confederate States of America. In April 1861, the American Civil War began when Confederate forces attacked the American fort at Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. From 1865 to 1877, South Carolina underwent Reconstruction. Congress shut down the civilian government in 1867, put the army in charge, gave Freedmen (freed slaves) the vote and prevented ex- Confederates from holding office. A Republican legislature supported by Freedmen, northern carpetbaggers and white Southern scalawags created and funded a public school system, and created social welfare institutions. The constitution they passed was kept nearly unaltered for 27 years, and most legislation passed during the Reconstruction years lasted longer than that. By 1877, the white conservatives, calling themselves \\"Redeemers\\", had regained political power. In the 1880s, Jim Crow laws were passed that were especially severe in the state, to create public segregation and control movement of African-American laborers. After 1890, almost all blacks lost their vote, not to regain it until 1965. An 1861 engraving of Fort Sumter before the attack that began the Civil War The Civil War ruined the economy, and continued dependence on agriculture made South Carolina one of the two or three poorest states for the next century. Educational levels were low as public schools were underfunded, especially for African Americans. Most people lived on small farms and grew cotton. The more affluent landowners subdivided their land into farms operated by tenant farmers or sharecroppers, along with land operated by the owner using hired labor. Gradually more industry moved into the Piedmont area, with textile factories that processed the state's raw cotton into yarn and cloth for sale on the international market. Wave after wave of revivals made most people quite religious; most people, white and black alike, were Baptists. Politically the state became part of the Democratic Solid South after whites regained control of the state legislature and governor's office in 1876; they disfranchised African Americans by a new state constitution in 1895, and no black officials were elected between 1900 and 1970. In the first half of the 20th century, many blacks left the state to go to northern cities during the Great Migration. Whites rigidly enforced segregation in the Jim Crow era, limiting African Americans' chances for education, free public movement, and closing them out of the political system. The federal Civil Rights laws of the 1960s ended segregation and protected the voting rights of African Americans. The blacks had been affiliated with the Republican Party, but after 1964 became intensely loyal Democrats, while most white conservatives moved in the opposite direction. The cotton regime ended by the 1950s. As factories were built across the state, the great majority of farmers left agriculture. Service industries, such as tourism, education and medical care, grew rapidly, as the textile factories faded after 1970 with movement of jobs offshore. By 2000, the white majority of South Carolina voted solidly Republican in presidential elections, but state and local government elections were contested by the two parties. The population continued to grow, reaching 4 million in 2000, as coast areas became prime locations for tourists and retirees. The poverty rate of 13.5% is slightly worse than the national average of 11.7%. ==Early history== Humans arrived in the area of South Carolina around 13,000 BC. These people were hunters with crude tools made from stones and bones. Around 10,000 BC, they used spears and hunted big game. Over the Archaic period of 8000 to 2000 BC, the people gathered nuts, berries, fish and shellfish as part of their diets. Trade between the coastal plain and the piedmont developed. There is evidence of plant domestication and pottery in the late Archaic. The Woodland period brought more serious agriculture, more sophisticated pottery, and the bow and arrow.Edgar 1998, pp. 11‚Äì12 By the time of the first European exploration, twenty-nine tribes or nations of Native Americans, divided by major language families, lived within the boundaries of what became South Carolina. Algonquian-speaking tribes lived in the low country, Siouan and Iroquoian-speaking in the Piedmont and uplands, respectively. ==Colonial period== The Carolina Colonies By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish and French had left the area of South Carolina after several reconnaissance missions, expeditions and failed colonization attempts, notably the short-living French outpost of Charlesfort followed by the Spanish town of Santa Elena on modern-day Parris Island between 1562 and 1587. In 1629, Charles I, King of England, granted his attorney general a charter to everything between latitudes 36 and 31. He called this land the Province of Carolana, which would later be changed to \\"Carolina\\" for pronunciation, after the Latin form of his own name. In 1663, Charles II granted the land to the eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. Charles II intended that the newly created Province of Carolina would serve as an English bulwark to the contested lands claimed by Spanish Florida and prevent Spanish expansion northward. The eight nobles ruled the Province of Carolina as a proprietary colony. After the Yamasee War of 1715‚Äì1717, the Lords Proprietors came under increasing pressure from settlers and were forced to relinquish their charter to the Crown in 1719. The proprietors retained their right to the land until 1719, when the colony was officially split into the provinces of North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies. In April 1670, settlers arrived at Albemarle Point, at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers. They founded Charles Town, named in honor of King Charles II. Throughout the Colonial Period, the Carolinas participated in many wars against the Spanish and the Native Americans, including the Yamasee and Cherokee tribes. In its first decades, the colony's plantations were relatively small and its wealth came from Native American trade, mainly in Native American slaves and deerskins. The slave trade adversely affected tribes throughout the Southeast and exacerbated enmity and competition among some of them. Historians estimate that Carolinians exported 24,000‚Äì51,000 Native American slaves from 1670 to 1717, sending them to markets ranging from Boston in North America to Barbados.Joseph Hall, \\"The Great Indian Slave Caper\\", review of Alan Gallay, The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002, Common-place, vol. 3, no. 1, October 2002, accessed 4 Nov 2009 Planters financed the purchase of African slaves by their sale of Native Americans, finding that they were somewhat easier to control, as they did not know the territory to make good an escape. Perhaps the most notable moment in history for South Carolina was the creation of the Regulators in the 1760s, one of the first organized militias in the New World. The militia proposed ideas of independence and brought increased recognition to the need for backcountry rights in the Carolinas. This led to the War of the Regulators, a battle between the regulators and the British soldiers, led mainly by British Royal Governor William Tryon, in the area. This battle was the first catalyst in the American Revolution. ===Native people=== Divided roughly along the Santee River were the two main groups of Native American peoples‚Äî Eastern Siouan & the Cusaboan tribes. Relative to the Siouans were mostly the Waccamaw, Sewee, Woccon, Chickanee (a smaller offshoot of the northern Wateree), Winyaw & the Santee (not to be confused with the Dakota Santee of the west.).\\"The Unabridged Version of Tribes of the Carolina Lowland: Pedee - Sewee - Winyaw - Waccamaw - Cape Fear - Congaree - Wateree - Santee.\\" Stanley South. University of South Carolina - Columbia, stansouth@sc.edu (1972) Most of the region south of the Santee River was controlled by the Muskogean Cusabo tribes. Some Muskogean speaking tribes, like the Coree lived among the Siouans, however. North of the Sewee were the Croatan, an Algonquian nation related to the Chowanoke, Piscataway, Nanticoke & Powhatan further north. Many descendants of the Croatan survive among the Lumbee, who also took in many Siouan peoples of the region. Deeper inland were the lands of the Chalaques, or ancestral Cherokees. Other tribes who entered the region over time were the Westo, an Iroquoian people believed to have been the same as the Erie indians of Ohio. During the Beaver Wars period, they were pushed out of their homeland by the Iroquois & conquered their way down from the Ohio River into South Carolina, becoming a nuisance to the local populations & damaging the Chalaques. They were destroyed in 1681, and, afterward, the Chalaques split into the Yuchi of North Carolina & the Cherokee to the south, with other fragment groups wandering off into different areas. Also, after this conflict, Muskogeans wandered north and became the Yamasee.Oatis, A Colonial Complex When the Cherokee & Yuchi later reformed into the Creek Confederacy after the Yamasee War, they destroyed the Yamasee, who became backwater nomads. They spread out between the states of South Carolina & Florida. Today, several Yamasee tribes have since reformed. The Siouan peoples of the state were relatively small & lived a wide variety of lifestyles. Some had absorbed aspects of Muskogean culture, while others lived like the Virginian Saponi people. Most had a traditional Siouan government of a chief-led council, while others (like the Santee) were thought of as tyrannical monarchies. They were among the first to experience colonial contact by the Spanish colony in the state during the 16th century. After the colony collapsed, the native peoples even borrowed their cows & pigs and took up animal husbandry. They liked the idea so much, they went on to capture and domesticate other animals, such as geese and turkeys. Their downfall was a combination of European diseases & warfare. After the English reached the region, many members of these tribes ended up on both sides of most wars. The Sewee in particular met their end in a bizarre circumstance of virtually all the men of their people deciding to cut out the middleman and launched a canoe flotilla to cross the Atlantic so they could trade with Europe directly. They never returned. In the end, all the Siouan peoples of the Carolinas ended up merging with the Catawba, who relocated to the N- S Carolina border around the Yadkin River. Later, the United States amalgamated the Catawba with the Cherokee & they were sent west on the Trail of Tears after the drafting of the Indian Removal Act in the 1830s.Speck, Frank G. Catawba Texts 1934. ===18th century=== In the 1700‚Äì70 era, the colony possessed many advantages - entrepreneurial planters and businessmen, a major harbor, the expansion of cost-efficient African slave labor, and an attractive physical environment, with rich soil and a long growing season, albeit with endemic malaria. Planters established rice and indigo as commodity crops, based in developing large plantations, with long-staple cotton grown on the sea islands. As the demand for labor increased, planters imported increasing numbers of African slaves. The slave population grew as they had children. These children were also regarded as slaves as they grew up, as South Carolina used Virginia's model of declaring all children born to slave mothers as slaves, regardless of the race or nationality of the father. So the majority of slaves in the colony came to be native-born. This became one of the wealthiest of the British colonies. Rich colonials became avid consumers of services from outside the colony, such as mercantile services, medical education, and legal training in England. Almost everyone in 18th-century South Carolina felt the pressures, constraints, and opportunities associated with the growing importance of trade.Peter A. Coclanis, \\"Global perspectives on the early economic history of South Carolina,\\" South Carolina Historical Magazine, April- July 2005, Vol. 106, #2-3, pp. 130‚Äì146 ===Yamasee war=== A pan-Native American alliance rose up against the settlers in the Yamasee War (1715‚Äì17), in part due to the tribes' opposition to the Native American slave trade. The Native Americans nearly destroyed the colony. But the colonists and Native American allies defeated the Yemasee and their allies, such as the Iroquoian-speaking Tuscarora people. The latter emigrated from the colony north to western New York state, where by 1722 they declared the migration ended. They were accepted as the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. Combined with exposure to European infectious diseases, the backcountry's Yemasee population was greatly reduced by the fierce warfare.William L. Ramsey, The Yemasee War: A Study of Culture, Economy, and Conflict in the Colonial South (2008) ===Slaves=== Census listing number of slaves in South Carolina, 1721 After the Yamasee War, the planters turned exclusively to importing African slaves for labor. With the establishment of rice and indigo as commodity export crops, South Carolina became a slave society, with slavery central to its economy. By 1708, African slaves composed a majority of the population in the colony; the blacks composed the majority of the population in the state into the 20th century.Wilson, Thomas D. The Ashley Cooper Plan: The Founding of Carolina and the Origins of Southern Political Culture. Chapter 3. Planters used slave labor to support cultivation and processing of rice and indigo as commodity crops. Building dams, irrigation ditches and related infrastructure, enslaved Africans created the equivalent of huge earthworks to regulate water for the rice culture. Although the methods for cultivation of rice were patterned on those of West African rice growers, white planters took credit for what they called \\"an achievement no less skillful than that which excites our wonder in viewing the works of the ancient Egyptians.\\"Carney, Judith A. Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas. 97-98. While some lifetime indentured servants came to South Carolina transported as prisoners from Britain, having been sentenced for their part in the failed Scottish Jacobite Rebellions of 1744‚Äì46, by far most of the slaves came from West Africa. In the Low Country, including the Sea Islands, where large populations of Africans lived together, they developed a creolized culture and language known as Gullah/Geechee (the latter a term used in Georgia). They interacted with and adopted some elements of the English language and colonial culture and language. The Gullah adapted to elements of American society during the slavery years. Since the late nineteenth century, they have retained their distinctive life styles, products, and language to perpetuate their unique ethnic identity.J. Lorand Matory, \\"The Illusion of Isolation: The Gullah/Geechees and the Political Economy of African Culture in the Americas\\", Comparative Studies in Society & History, Oct 2008, Vol. 50 Issue 4, pp. 949‚Äì980, text available online at Duke University Beginning about 1910, tens of thousands of blacks left the state in the Great Migration, traveling for work and other opportunities to the northern and midwestern industrial cities. ===Low country=== The Low Country was settled first, dominated by wealthy English men who became owners of large amounts of land on which they established plantations.S. Max Edelson, Plantation Enterprise in Colonial South Carolina (2007) They first transported white indentured servants as laborers, mostly teenage youth from England who came to work off their passage in hopes of learning to farm and buying their own land. Planters also imported African laborers to the colony. In the early colonial years, social boundaries were fluid between indentured laborers and slaves, and there was considerable intermarriage. Gradually the terms of enslavement became more rigid, and slavery became a racial caste. South Carolina used Virginia's model of declaring all children born to slave mothers as slaves, regardless of the race or nationality of the father. In the Upper South, there were many mixed-race slaves with white planter fathers. With a decrease in English settlers as the economy improved in England before the beginning of the 18th century, the planters began to rely chiefly on enslaved Africans for labor. The market for land functioned efficiently and reflected both rapid economic development and widespread optimism regarding future economic growth. The frequency and turnover rate for land sales were tied to the general business cycle; the overall trend was upward, with almost half of the sales occurring in the decade before the American Revolution. Prices also rose over time, parallel with the rise in the price for rice. Prices dropped dramatically, however, in the years just before the American Revolution, when fears arose about future prospects outside the system of English mercantilist trade.David B. Ryden and Russell R. Menard, \\"South Carolina's Colonial Land Market,\\" Social Science History, Winter 2005, Vol. 29 Issue 4, pp. 599‚Äì623 ===Back country=== In contrast to the Tidewater, the back country was settled later in the 18th century, chiefly by Scots-Irish and North British migrants, who had quickly moved down from Pennsylvania and Virginia. The immigrants from Ulster, the Scottish lowlands, and the north of England (the border counties) composed the largest group from the British Isles before the Revolution. They came mostly in the 18th century, later than other colonial immigrants. Such \\"North Britons were a large majority in much of the South Carolina upcountry.\\" The character of this environment was \\"well matched to the culture of the British borderlands.\\"David Hackett Fischer. Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (1989), pp. 634‚Äì635 They settled in the backcountry throughout the South and relied on subsistence farming. Mostly they did not own slaves. Given the differences in background, class, slave holding, economics, and culture, there was long-standing competition between the Low Country and back country that played out in politics. ===Rice=== In the early period, planters earned wealth from two major crops: rice and indigo (see below), both of which relied on slave labor for their cultivation.Richard Schulze, Carolina Gold Rice: The Ebb and Flow History of a Lowcountry Cash Crop (2006) Exports of these crops led South Carolina to become one of the wealthiest colonies prior to the Revolution. Near the beginning of the 18th century, planters began rice culture along the coast, mainly in the Georgetown and Charleston areas. The rice became known as Carolina Gold, both for its color and its ability to produce great fortunes for plantation owners.Rise of the Georgetown Rice Culture ===Indigo production=== In the 1740s, Eliza Lucas Pinckney began indigo culture and processing in coastal South Carolina. Indigo was in heavy demand in Europe for making dyes for clothing. An \\"Indigo Bonanza\\" followed, with South Carolina production approaching a million pounds (400 plus Tonnes) in the late 1750s. This growth was stimulated by a British bounty of six pence per pound.\\"Rice, Indigo, and Fever in Colonial South Carolina\\" accessed 7 Mar 2008 South Carolina did not have a monopoly of the British market, but the demand was strong and many planters switched to the new crop when the price of rice fell. Carolina indigo had a mediocre reputation because Carolina planters failed to achieve consistent high quality production standards. Carolina indigo nevertheless succeeded in displacing French and Spanish indigo in the British and in some continental markets, reflecting the demand for cheap dyestuffs from manufacturers of low-cost textiles, the fastest-growing sectors of the European textile industries at the onset of industrialization.R. C. Nash, \\"South Carolina indigo, European textiles, and the British Atlantic economy in the eighteenth century,\\" Economic History Review, May 2010, Vol. 63 Issue 2, pp. 362‚Äì392 In addition, the colonial economy depended on sales of pelts (primarily deerskins), and naval stores and timber. Coastal towns began shipbuilding to support their trade, using the prime timbers of the live oak. ===Jews and Huguenots=== South Carolina's liberal constitution and early flourishing trade attracted Sephardic Jewish immigrants as early as the 18th century. They were mostly elite businessmen from London and Barbados, where they had been involved in the rum and sugar trades. Many became slaveholders. In 1800, Charleston had the largest Jewish population of any city in the United States.\\"History of Jews in South Carolina\\", Jewish Encyclopedia Huguenot Protestant refugees from France were welcomed and many became mechanics and businessmen.Kurt Gingrich, \\"'That Will Make Carolina Powerful and Flourishing': Scots and Huguenots in Carolina in the 1680s.\\" South Carolina Historical Magazine 110.1/2 (2009): 6-34. online ===Negro Act of 1740=== The comprehensive Negro Act of 1740 was passed in South Carolina, during Governor William Bull's time in office, in response to the Stono Rebellion in 1739. The act made it illegal for enslaved Africans to move abroad, assemble in groups, raise food, earn money, and learn to write (though reading was not proscribed). Additionally, owners were permitted to kill rebellious slaves if necessary. The Act remained in effect until 1865. ==Revolutionary War== Prior to the American Revolution, the British began taxing American colonies to raise revenue. Residents of South Carolina were outraged by the Townsend Acts that taxed tea, paper, wine, glass, and oil. To protest the Stamp Act, South Carolina sent the wealthy rice planter Thomas Lynch, twenty-six-year-old lawyer John Rutledge, and Christopher Gadsden to the Stamp Act Congress, held in 1765 in New York. Other taxes were removed, but tea taxes remained. Soon residents of South Carolina, like those of the Boston Tea Party, began to dump tea into the Charleston Harbor, followed by boycotts and protests. South Carolina set up its state government and constitution on March 26, 1776. Because of the colony's longstanding trade ties with Great Britain, the Low Country cities had numerous Loyalists. Many of the Patriot battles fought in South Carolina during the American Revolution were against loyalist Carolinians and the Cherokee Nation, which was allied with the British. This was to British General Henry Clinton's advantage, as his strategy was to march his troops north from St. Augustine and sandwich George Washington in the North. Clinton alienated Loyalists and enraged Patriots by attacking and nearly annihilating a fleeing army of Patriot soldiers who posed no threat. White colonists were not the only ones with a desire for freedom. Estimates are that about 25,000 slaves escaped, migrated or died during the disruption of the war, 30 percent of the state's slave population. About 13,000 joined the British, who had promised them freedom if they left rebel masters and fought with them. From 1770 to 1790, the proportion of the state's population made up of blacks (almost all of whom were enslaved), dropped from 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619-1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73 Lord Charles Montagu, South Carolina Governor On October 7, 1780, at Kings Mountain, John Sevier and William Campbell, using volunteers from the mountains and from Tennessee, surrounded 1000 Loyalist soldiers camped on a mountain top. It was a decisive Patriot victory. It was the first Patriot victory since the British had taken Charleston. Thomas Jefferson, governor of Virginia at the time, called it, \\"The turn of the tide of success.\\"Kings Mountain National Military Park, National Park Service, accessed 5 Mar 2008 While tensions mounted between the Crown and the Carolinas, some key southern Pastors became a target of King George: \\"... this church (Bullock Creek) was noted as one of the \\"Four Bees\\" in King George's bonnet due to its pastor, Rev. Joseph Alexander, preaching open rebellion to the British Crown in June 1780. Bullock Creek Presbyterian Church was a place noted for being a Whig party stronghold. Under a ground swell of such Calvin Protestant leadership, South Carolina moved from a back seat to the front in the war against tyranny. Patriots went on to regain control of Charleston and South Carolina with untrained militiamen by trapping Colonel Banastre \\"No Quarter\\" Tarleton's troops along a river. In 1787, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Pierce Butler went to Philadelphia where the Constitutional Convention was being held and constructed what served as a detailed outline for the U.S. Constitution. The federal Constitution was ratified by the state in 1787. The new state constitution was ratified in 1790 without the support of the Upcountry. ===Scots Irish=== During the Revolution, the Scots Irish in the back country in most states were noted as strong patriots. One exception was the Waxhaw settlement on the lower Catawba River along the North Carolina-South Carolina boundary, where Loyalism was strong. The area had two main settlement periods of Scotch Irish. During the 1750s‚Äì1760s, second- and third-generation Scotch Irish Americans moved from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. This particular group had large families, and as a group they produced goods for themselves and for others. They generally were patriots. In addition to these, The Earl of Donegal arrived in Charleston on December 22, 1767, from Belfast, bringing approximately fifty families over who received land grants under the Bounty Act. Most of these families settled in the upstate. A portion of these eventually migrated into Georgia and on into Alabama. Just prior to the Revolution, a second stream of immigrants came directly from northern Ireland via Charleston. Mostly poor, this group settled in an underdeveloped area because they could not afford expensive land. Most of this group remained loyal to the Crown or neutral when the war began. Prior to Charles Cornwallis's march into the backcountry in 1780, two-thirds of the men among the Waxhaw settlement had declined to serve in the army. British victory at the Battle of the Waxhaws resulted in anti-British sentiment in a bitterly divided region. While many individuals chose to take up arms against the British, the British forced the people to choose sides, as they were trying to recruit Loyalists for a militia.Peter N. Moore, \\"The Local Origins of Allegiance in Revolutionary South Carolina: The Waxhaws as a Case Study,\\" South Carolina Historical Magazine 2006 107(1): 26-41 ===Loyalists=== South Carolina had one of the strongest Loyalists factions of any state. About 5000 men took up arms against the Patriot government during revolution, and thousands more were supporters. Nearly all had immigrated to the province after 1765, only about one in six was native-born. About 45% of the Loyalists were small farmers, 30% were merchants, artisans or shopkeepers; 15% were large farmers or plantation owners; 10% Were royal officials. Geographically they were strongest in the backcountry.Walter Edgar, ed. South Carolina Encyclopedia (2006) pp 571-73.Robert Stansbury Lambert, South Carolina Loyalists in the American Revolution (2nd ed. Clemson University Digital Press, 2011) online free Although the state had experienced a bitter bloody internal civil war 1780-82, civilian leaders nevertheless adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. Some were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property. The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.Rebecca Brannon, From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South Carolina Loyalists (U. of South Carolina Press, 2016). Rebecca Brannon, says South Carolinians, \\"offered the most generous reconciliation to Loyalists ... despite suffering the worst extremes of violent civil war\\" According to a reviewer, she: > convincingly argues that South Carolinians, driven by social, political, and > economic imperatives, engaged in a process of integration that was > significantly more generous than that of other states. Indeed, Brannon's > account strongly suggests that it was precisely the brutality and > destructiveness of the conflict in the Palmetto State that led South > Carolinians to favor reconciliation over retribution.Jason Stroud. Review of > Brannon, Rebecca, From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South > Carolina Loyalists H-Early-America, H-Net Reviews. May, 2018. ==Antebellum South Carolina== the Battery, Charleston. South Carolina led opposition to national law during the Nullification Crisis. It was the first state to declare its secession in 1860 in response to the election of Abraham Lincoln. Dominated by major planters, it was the only state in which slaveholders composed a majority of the legislature. ===Politics and slavery=== After the Revolutionary War, numerous slaves were freed. Most of the northern states abolished slavery, sometimes combined with gradual emancipation. In the Upper South, inspired by revolutionary ideals and activist preachers, state legislatures passed laws making it easier for slaveholders to manumit (free) their slaves both during their lifetimes or by wills. Quakers, Methodists, and Baptists urged slaveholders to free their slaves. In the period from 1790 to 1810, the proportion and number of free blacks rose dramatically in the Upper South and overall, from less than 1 percent to more than 10 percent. When the importation of slaves became illegal in 1808, South Carolina was the only state that still allowed importation, which had been prohibited in the other states. Slave owners had more control over the state government of South Carolina than of any other state. Elite planters played the role of English aristocrats more than did the planters of other states. In the late antebellum years, the newer Southern states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, allowed more political equality among whites. Although all white male residents were allowed to vote, property requirements for office holders were higher in South Carolina than in any other state. It was the only state legislature in which slave owners held the majority of seats. The legislature elected the governor, all judges and state electors for federal elections, as well as the US senators into the 20th century, so its members had considerable political power. The state's chief executive was a figurehead who had no authority to veto legislative law. With its society disrupted by slave losses during the Revolution, South Carolina did not embrace manumission as readily as states of the Upper South. Most of its small number of free blacks were of mixed race, often the children of major planters or their sons, who made sexual use of young female slaves. Their wealthy fathers sometimes passed on social capital to such mixed-race children, arranging for their manumission even if officially denying them as legal heirs. Fathers sometimes arranged to have their slave children educated, arranged apprenticeships in skilled trades, and other preparation for independent adulthood. Some planters sent their mixed-race slave children to schools and colleges in the North for education. In the early 19th century, the state legislature passed laws making manumission more difficult. The manumission law of 1820 required slaveholders to gain legislative approval for each act of manumission and generally required other free adults to testify that the person to be freed could support himself. This meant that freedmen were unable to free their slave children, since the first law required that five citizens attest to the ability of the person proposed to be freed to earn a living. In 1820, the legislature ended personal manumissions, requiring all slaveholders to gain individual permission from the legislature before manumitting anyone. The majority of the population in South Carolina was black, with concentrations in the plantation areas of the Low Country: by 1860 the population of the state was 703,620, with 57 percent or slightly more than 402,000 classified as slaves. Free blacks numbered slightly less than 10,000.W.E.B. Du Bois, Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880, New York: 1935, Free Press edition, 1998, p. 383 A concentration of free people of color lived in Charleston, where they formed an elite racial caste of people who had more skills and education than most blacks. Unlike Virginia, where most of the larger plantations and slaves were concentrated in the eastern part of the state, in South Carolina plantations and slaves became common throughout much of the state. After 1794, Eli Whitney's cotton gin allowed cotton plantations for short-staple cotton to be widely developed in the Piedmont area, which became known as the Black Belt of the state. By 1830, 85% of inhabitants of rice plantations in the Low Country were slaves. When rice planters left the malarial low country for cities such as Charleston during the social season, up to 98% of the Low Country residents were slaves. This led to a preservation of West African customs while developing the Creole culture known as Gullah.William H. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists at Bay 1776-1854, pp. 213‚Äì228 By 1830, two-thirds of South Carolina's counties had populations with 40 percent or more enslaved; even in the two counties with the lowest rates of slavery, 23 percent of the population were slaves. In 1822, a black freedman named Denmark Vesey and compatriots around Charlestown organized a plan for thousands of slaves to participate in an armed uprising to gain freedom. Vesey's plan, inspired by the 1791 Haitian Revolution, called for thousands of armed black men to kill their owners, seize the city of Charleston, and escape from the United States by sailing to Haiti. The plot was discovered when two slaves opposed to the plan leaked word of it to white authorities. Charleston authorities charged 131 men with participating in the conspiracy. In total, the state convicted 67 men and executed by hanging 35 of them, including Vesey. White fear of slave insurrections after the Vesey conspiracy led to a 9:15 pm curfew for slaves in Charleston, and the establishment of a municipal guard of 150 white men in Charleston, with half the men stationed in an arsenal called the Citadel. Columbia was protected by an arsenal. Plantations in older Southern states such as South Carolina wore out the soil to such an extent that 42% of state residents left the state for the lower South, to develop plantations with newer soil. The remaining South Carolina plantations were especially hard hit when worldwide cotton markets turned down in 1826‚Äì32 and again in 1837‚Äì49. Economic hardships caused many South Carolinians to believe that a \\"Forty Bale theory\\" explained their problems. ===Nullification=== The white minority in South Carolina felt more threatened than in other parts of the South, and reacted more to the economic Panic of 1819, the Missouri Controversy of 1820, and attempts at emancipation in the form of the Ohio Resolutions of 1824 and the American Colonization Petition of 1827.William H. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists at Bay 1776-1854, pp. 253‚Äì270 South Carolina's first attempt at nullification occurred in 1822, when South Carolina adopted a policy of jailing foreign black sailors at South Carolina ports. This policy violated a treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States, but South Carolina defied a complaint from Britain through American Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and a United States Supreme Court justice's federal circuit decision condemning the jailings. Foreign blacks from Santo Domingo had previously communicated with Denmark Vesey's conspirators, and the South Carolina State Senate declared that the need to prevent insurrections was more important than laws, treaties or constitutions. South Carolinian George McDuffie popularized the \\"Forty Bale theory\\" to explain South Carolina's economic woes. He said that tariffs that became progressively higher in 1816, 1824 and 1828 had the same effect as if a thief stole forty bales out of a hundred from every barn. The tariffs applied to imports of goods such as iron, wool, and finished cotton products. The Forty Bale theory was based on faulty math, as Britain could sell finished cotton goods made from Southern raw cotton around the world, not just to the United States. Still, the theory was a popular explanation for economic problems that were caused in large part by overproduction of cotton in the Deep South, competing with South Carolina's declining crops because of its depleted soil. South Carolinians, rightly or wrongly, blamed the tariff for the fact that cotton prices fell from 18 cents a pound to 9 cents a pound during the 1820s. While the effects of the tariff were exaggerated, manufactured imports from Europe were cheaper than American- made products without the tariff, and the tariff did reduce British imports of cotton to some extent. These were largely short-term problems that existed before United States factories and textile makers could compete with Europe. Also, the tariff replaced a tax system where slave states previously had to pay more in taxes for the increased representation they got in the U.S. House of Representatives under the three-fifths clause.Freehling, The Road to Disunion, pp. 146‚Äì148 The Tariff of 1828, which South Carolina agitators called the Tariff of Abominations, set the tariff rate at 50 percent. Although John C. Calhoun previously supported tariffs, he anonymously wrote the South Carolina Exposition and Protest, which was a states' rights argument for nullifying the tariff. Calhoun's theory was that the threat of secession would lead to a \\"concurrent majority\\" that would possess every white minority's consent, as opposed to a \\"tyrannical majority\\" of Northerners controlling the South. Both Calhoun and Robert Barnwell Rhett foresaw that the same arguments could be used to defend slavery when necessary.Freehling, Prelude to Civil War, p. 297; Willentz, p. 388 - On March 13, 1833 Rhett said, > A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their > destinies in their own hands ... Every stride of this Government, over your > rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole > world are in arms against your institutions ... Let Gentlemen not be > deceived. It is not the Tariff ‚Äì not Internal Improvement ‚Äì nor yet the > Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are > contending. ... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the > government is evinced ‚Äì but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: > and until this Government is made a limited Government ... there is no > liberty ‚Äì no security for the South. As early as 1830, in the midst of the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves as the chief southern minority right being threatened: \\"I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.\\" - Ellis, Richard E. The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis (1987), p. 193; Freehling, William W. Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816-1836. (1965), p. 257; Ellis, p. 193. Ellis further notes that \\"Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states' rights. At various points in their careers, John Taylor, John Randolph, and Nathaniel Macon had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open- ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners' wishes.\\" John Niven, John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union, p. 197 - The author said the following about Calhoun's description of the tariff issue: \\"Finally, the root of the nullification crisis was exposed. What had begun as a reaction to a depression in the cotton states, a slump that had been particularly severe in South Carolina, had rapidly resolved itself into an all-encompassing fear on the part of a majority of the planter elite class that the growing industrialization of the North, expressing itself politically through the majority will, would eventually demand emancipation, heedless of the social consequences.\\" President Andrew Jackson successfully forced the nullifiers to back down and allowed a gradual reduction of tariff rates. Calhoun and Senator Henry Clay agreed upon the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which would lower rates over 10 years.Library of Congress, \\"A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774-1875 Memory.loc.gov, accessed 7 Mar 2008 Calhoun later supported national protection for slavery in the form of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 and federal protection of slavery in the territories conquered from Mexico, in contradiction to his previous support for nullification and states' rights.Freehling, The Road to Disunion, p. 517 ===Censorship and slavery=== On July 29, 1835, Charleston Postmaster Alfred Huger found abolitionist literature in the mail, and refused to deliver it. Slave owners seized the mail and built a bonfire with it, and other Southern states followed South Carolina's lead in censoring abolitionist literature.William H. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists at Bay 1776-1854, p. 291 South Carolina's James Henry Hammond started the gag rule controversy by demanding a ban on petitions for ending slavery from being introduced before Congress in 1835.William H. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists at Bay 1776-1854, p. 308 The 1856 caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the South Carolinian Preston BrooksWilliam H. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854-1861, pp. 79‚Äì84 after Sumner's Crime Against Kansas speech heightened Northern fears that the alleged aggressions of the slave power threatened republican government for Northern whites. ===Protest of the Negro Act of 1740=== John Belton O'Neall summarized the Negro Act of 1740, in his written work, The Negro Law of South Carolina, when he stated: \\"A slave may, by the consent of his master, acquire and hold personal property. All, thus required, is regarded in law as that of the master.\\" Across the South, state supreme courts supported the position of this law. In 1848, O'Neall was the only one to express protest against the Act, arguing for the propriety of receiving testimony from enslaved Africans (many of whom, by 1848, were Christians) under oath: \\"Negroes (slave or free) will feel the sanctions of an oath, with as much force as any of the ignorant classes of white people, in a Christian country.\\" ===Secession and war=== South Carolina was the first state to secede from the Union after the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. South Carolina adopted the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union on December 24, 1860, following a briefer Ordinance of Secession adopted December 20. All of the violations of the alleged rights of Southern states mentioned in the document are about slavery. President Buchanan protested but made no military response aside from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter via the ship Star of the West, which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort.McPherson, Battle Cry, pp. 234‚Äì266 ==American Civil WarPrewar tensions=== Few white South Carolinians considered abolition of slavery as an option. Having lived as a minority among the majority-black slaves, they feared that, if freed, the slaves would try to \\"Africanize\\" the whites' cherished society and culture. This was what they believed had happened after slave revolutions in Haiti, in which numerous whites and free people of color were killed during the revolution. South Carolina's white politicians were divided between devoted Unionists who opposed any sort of secession, and those who believed secession was a state's right. John C. Calhoun noted that the dry and barren West could not support a plantation system and would remain without slaves. Calhoun proposed that Congress should not exclude slavery from territories but let each state choose for itself whether it would allow slaves within its borders. After Calhoun's death in 1850, however, South Carolina was left without a leader great enough in national standing and character to prevent action by those more militant South Carolinian factions who wanted to secede immediately. Andrew Pickens Butler argued against Charleston publisher Robert Barnwell Rhett, who advocated immediate secession and, if necessary, independence. Butler won the battle, but Rhett outlived him. When people began to believe that Abraham Lincoln would be elected president, states in the Deep South organized conventions to discuss their options. South Carolina was the first state to organize such a convention, meeting in December following the national election. On December 20, 1860, delegates convened in Charleston and voted unanimously to secede from the Union. President James Buchanan declared the secession illegal, but did not act to stop it. The first six states to secede with the largest slaveholding states in the South, demonstrating that the slavery societies were an integral part of the secession question. ===Fort Sumter=== 1861, inside Ft. Sumter, flying the flag of Robert E. Lee's Headquarters. On February 4, the seven seceded states approved a new constitution for the Confederate States of America. Lincoln argued that the United States were \\"one nation, indivisible,\\" and denied the Southern states' right to secede. South Carolina entered the Confederacy on February 8, 1861, thus ending fewer than six weeks of being an independent State of South Carolina. Meanwhile Major Robert Anderson, commander of the U.S. troops in Charleston, withdrew his men into the small island fortress of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and raised the U.S. flag. Fort Sumter was vastly outgunned by shore batteries and was too small to be a military threat but it had high symbolic value. In a letter delivered January 31, 1861, South Carolina Governor Pickens demanded of President Buchanan that he surrender Fort Sumter, because \\"I regard that possession is not consistent with the dignity or safety of the State of South Carolina.\\" Buchanan refused. Lincoln was determined to hold it to assert national power and prestige; he wanted the Confederacy to fire the first shot. If it was to be a dignified independent nation the Confederacy could not tolerate a foreign fort in its second largest harbor.William J. Cooper, We Have the War Upon Us: The Onset of the Civil War, November 1860 April 1861 (2012). About 6,000 Confederate men were stationed around the rim of the harbor, ready to take on the 60 men in Fort Sumter. At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, after two days of fruitless negotiations, and with Union ships just outside the harbor, the Confederates opened fire on orders from President Jefferson Davis. Edmund Ruffin fired the first shot. Thirty- four hours later, Anderson's men raised the white flag and were allowed to leave the fort with colors flying and drums beating, saluting the U.S. flag with a 50-gun salute before taking it down. During this salute, one of the guns exploded, killing a young soldier‚Äîthe only casualty of the bombardment and the first casualty of the war. In a mass frenzy, North and South men rushed to enlist, as Lincoln called up troops to recapture the fort.David Detzer, Allegiance: Fort Sumter, Charleston, and the Beginning of the Civil War (2001) ===Civil War devastates the state=== The South was at a disadvantage in number, weaponry, and maritime skills; the region did not have much of a maritime tradition and few sailors. Federal ships sailed south and blocked off one port after another. As early as November, Union troops occupied the Sea Islands in the Beaufort area, and established an important base for the men and ships that would obstruct the ports at Charleston and Savannah. Many plantation owners had already fled to distant interior refuges, sometimes taking their slaves with them. Those African-Americans who remained on the Sea Islands became the first \\"freedmen\\" of the war. Under military supervision, the Sea Islands became a laboratory for education, with Northern missionary teachers finding former enslaved adults as well as children eager for learning. The supervisors assigned plots of plantation land to individual freedmen households, who began to do subsistence farming, generally of food crops and cotton or rice. Despite South Carolina's important role, and the Union's unsuccessful attempt to take Charleston from 1863 onward, fighting was largely limited to naval activities until almost the end of the war. Having completed his March to the Sea at Savannah in 1865, Union General Sherman took his army to Columbia, then north into North Carolina. With most major Confederate resistance eliminated by this point, the Union army was nearly unopposed. Sherman's troops embarked on an orgy of looting and destruction as there was widespread resentment at South Carolina being \\"the mother of secession\\" and the principal reason why the war started in the first place. Columbia and many other towns were burned. On February 21, 1865, with the Confederate forces finally evacuated from Charleston, the black 54th Massachusetts Regiment, led by Thomas Baker, Albert Adams, David Adams, Nelson R. Anderson, William H. Alexander, Beverly Harris, Joseph Anderson, Robert Abram, Elijah Brown, Wiley Abbott, marched through the city. At a ceremony at which the U.S. flag was raised over Fort Sumter, former fort commander Robert Anderson was joined on the platform by two African Americans: Union hero Robert Smalls, who had piloted a Confederate ship to Union lines, and the son of Denmark Vesey. Continuing to rely on agriculture in a declining market, landowners in the state struggled with the change to free labor, as well as the aftermath of the war's destruction. There was an agricultural depression and deep financial recession in 1873, and changes in the labor market disrupted agriculture. South Carolina lost proportionally more of its young men of fighting age than did any other Southern state. Recorded deaths were 18,666; however, fatalities might have reached 21,146. This was 31‚Äì35% of the total of white men of ages 18‚Äì45 recorded in the 1860 census for South Carolina. As with other military forces, most of the men died of disease rather than being wounded in battle.Walter B. Edgar. South Carolina: A History\\". Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 1998, p. 375. ==Reconstruction 1865‚Äì1877== A cotton farmer and his children pose before taking their crop to a cotton gin, ca. 1870 African Americans had long composed the majority of the state's population. However, in 1860, only 2 percent of the state's black population were free; most were mulattos or free people of color, with ties of kinship to white families. They were well established as more educated and skilled artisans in Charleston and some other cities despite social restrictions, and sometimes as landowners and slaveholders. As a result, free people of color before the war became important leaders in the South Carolina government during Reconstruction; they made up 26 percent of blacks elected to office in the state between 1868 and 1876 and played important roles in the Republican Party, prepared by their education, skills and experiences before the war.E. Horace Fitchett, \\"The Traditions of the Free Negro in Charleston, South Carolina\\", Journal of Negro History, XXV (April 1940), p. 139Thomas Holt, Black Over White: Negro Political Leadership in South Carolina During Reconstruction, University of Illinois Press, 1979, p. 43 Despite the anti-Northern fury of prewar and wartime politics, most South Carolinians, including the state's leading opinion-maker, Wade Hampton III, believed that white citizens would do well to accept President Andrew Johnson's terms for full reentry to the Union. However, the state legislature, in 1865, passed \\"Black Codes\\" to control the work and movement of freedmen. This angered Northerners, who accused the state of imposing semi-slavery on the freedmen. The South Carolina Black Codes have been described: > Persons of color contracting for service were to be known as \\"servants\\", and > those with whom they contracted, as \\"masters.\\" On farms the hours of labor > would be from sunrise to sunset daily, except on Sunday. The negroes were to > get out of bed at dawn. Time lost would be deducted from their wages, as > would be the cost of food, nursing, etc., during absence from sickness. > Absentees on Sunday must return to the plantation by sunset. House servants > were to be at call at all hours of the day and night on all days of the > week. They must be \\"especially civil and polite to their masters, their > masters' families and guests\\", and they in return would receive \\"gentle and > kind treatment.\\" Corporal and other punishment was to be administered only > upon order of the district judge or other civil magistrate. A vagrant law of > some severity was enacted to keep the negroes from roaming the roads and > living the lives of beggars and thieves.Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer, A History > of the United States since the Civil War (1917) 1:128‚Äì129 The Black Codes outraged northern opinion and apparently were never put into effect in any state. ===Republican rule=== After winning the 1866 elections, the Radical Republicans took control of the Reconstruction process. The Army registered all male voters, and elections returned a Republican government composed of a coalition of freedmen, \\"carpetbaggers\\", and \\"scalawags\\". By a constitutional convention, new voters created the Constitution of 1868; this brought democratic reforms to the state, including its first public school system. Native white Republicans supported it, but white Democrats viewed the Republican government as representative of black interests only and were largely unsupportive. Adding to the interracial animosity was the sense of many whites that their former slaves had betrayed them. Before the war, slaveholders had convinced themselves that they were treating their slaves well and had earned their slaves' loyalty. When the Union Army rolled in and slaves deserted by the thousands, slaveholders were stunned. The black population scrambled to preserve its new rights while the white population attempted to claw its way back up the social ladder by denying blacks those same rights and reviving white supremacy. Ku Klux Klan raids began shortly after the end of the war, as a first stage of insurgency. Secret chapters had members who terrorized and murdered blacks and their sympathizers in an attempt to reestablish white supremacy. These raids were particularly prevalent in the upstate, and they reached a climax in 1870‚Äì71. Congress passed a series of Enforcement Acts aimed at curbing Klan activity, and the Grant administration eventually declared martial law in the upstate counties of Spartanburg, York, Marion, Chester, Laurens, Newberry, Fairfield, Lancaster, and Chesterfield in October 1870.Allen W. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction,' (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 1971), 402-418' The declaration was followed by mass arrests and a series of Congressional hearings to investigate violence in the region. Though the federal program resulted in over 700 indictments, there were few successful prosecutions, and many of those individuals later received pardons. The ultimate weakness of the response helped to undermine federal authority in the state, though formal Klan activity declined precipitously following federal intervention. The violence in the state did not subside, however. New insurgent groups formed as paramilitary units and rifle clubs who operated openly in the 1870s to disrupt Republican organizing and suppress black voting; such groups included the Red Shirts, as of 1874, and their violence killed more than 100 blacks during the political season of 1876. ===Spending and debt=== A major theme of conservative opposition to Republican state government was the escalating state debt, and the rising taxes paid by a white population that was much poorer than before the war. Much of the state money had been squandered or wasted. Simkins and Woody say that, \\"The state debt increased rapidly, interest was seldom paid, and credit of the state was almost wiped out; yet with one or two exceptions the offenders were not brought to justice.\\"Francis Butler Simkins, and Robert Henley Woody, South Carolina During Reconstruction (1932). pp. 147‚Äì86, quote, p. 147 Reconstruction government established public education for the first time, and new charitable institutions, together with improved prisons. There was corruption, but it was mostly white Southerners who benefited, particularly by investments to develop railroads and other infrastructure. Taxes had been exceedingly low before the war because the planter class refused to support programs such as education welfare. The exigencies of the postwar period caused the state debt to climb rapidly. When Republicans came to power in 1868, the debt stood at $5.4 million. By the time Republicans lost control in 1877, state debt had risen to $18.5 million. ===The 1876 gubernatorial election=== From 1868 on, elections were accompanied by increasing violence from white paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts. Because of the violence in 1870, Republican Governor Chamberlain requested assistance from Washington to try to keep control. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to try to preserve order and ensure a fair election.The Political Situation, 10 December 1871, The New York Times, accessed 5 Mar 2008 Using as a model the \\"Mississippi Plan\\", which had redeemed that state in 1874, South Carolina whites used intimidation, violence, persuasion, and control of the blacks. In 1876, tensions were high, especially in Piedmont towns where the numbers of blacks were fewer than whites. In these counties, blacks sometimes made up a narrow majority. There were numerous demonstrations by the Red Shirts‚Äîwhite Democrats determined to win the upcoming elections by any means possible. The Red Shirts turned the tide in South Carolina, convincing whites that this could indeed be the year they regain control and terrorizing blacks to stay away from voting, due to incidents such as the Hamburg Massacre in July, the Ellenton riots in October,Mark M. Smith, \\"'All Is Not Quiet in Our Hellish County': Facts, Fiction, Politics, and Race - The Ellenton Riot of 1876,\\" South Carolina Historical Magazine, Vol. 95, No. 2 (April 1994), 142-155 and other similar events in Aiken County and Edgefield District. Armed with heavy pistols and rifles, they rode on horseback to every Republican meeting, and demanded a chance to speak. The Red Shirts milled among the crowds. Each selected a black man to watch, privately threatening to shoot him if he raised a disturbance. The Redeemers organized hundreds of rifle clubs. Obeying proclamations to disband, they sometimes reorganized as missionary societies or dancing clubs‚Äîwith rifles. They set up an ironclad economic boycott against black activists and \\"scalawags\\" who refused to vote the Democratic ticket. People lost jobs over their political views. They beat down the opposition‚Äîbut always just within the law. In 1876, Wade Hampton made more than forty speeches across the state. Some Black Republicans joined his cause; donning the Red Shirts, they paraded with the whites. Most scalawags \\"crossed Jordan\\", as switching to the Democrats was called. On election day, there was intimidation and fraud on all sides, employed by both parties. Edgefield and Laurens counties had more votes for Democratic candidate Wade Hampton III than the total number of registered voters in either county.Melinda Meeks Hennessy, \\"Racial Violence During Reconstruction: The 1876 Riots in Charleston and Cainhoy\\", South Carolina Historical Magazine, Vol. 86, No. 2, (April 1985), 104-106 The returns were disputed all the way to Washington, where they played a central role in the Compromise of 1877. Both parties claimed victory. For a while, two separate state assemblies did business side by side on the floor of the state house (their Speakers shared the Speaker's desk, but each had his own gavel), until the Democrats moved to their own building. There the Democrats continued to pass resolutions and conducted the state's business, just as the Republicans were doing. The Republican State Assembly tossed out results of the tainted election and reelected Chamberlain as governor. A week later, General Wade Hampton III took the oath of office for the Democrats. Finally, in return for the South's support of his own convoluted presidential \\"victory\\" over Samuel Tilden, President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops from Columbia and the rest of the South in 1877. The Republican government dissolved and Chamberlain headed north, as Wade Hampton and his Redeemers took control. ===Memory=== Whites and blacks in South Carolina developed different memories of Reconstruction and used them to justify their politics. James Shepherd Pike, a prominent Republican journalist, visited the state in 1873 and wrote accounts that were widely reprinted and published as a book, The Prostrate State (1874). Historian Eric Foner writes: > The book depicted a state engulfed by political corruption, drained by > governmental extravagance, and under the control of \\"a mass of black > barbarism.\\" The South's problems, he insisted, arose from \\"Negro > government.\\" The solution was to restore leading whites to political > power.Eric Foner, Give Me Liberty!: An American History (2nd ed. 2008) vol > 2, pp. 577‚Äì78 Similar views were developed in scholarly monographs by academic historians of the Dunning School based at Columbia University in the early 20th century; they served as historians at major colleges in the South, influencing interpretation of Reconstruction into the 1960s. They argued that corrupt Yankee carpetbaggers controlled for financial profit the mass of ignorant black voters and nearly plunged South Carolina into economic ruin and social chaos. The heroes in this version were the Red Shirts: white paramilitary insurgents who, beginning in 1874, rescued the state from misrule and preserved democracy, expelled blacks from the public square by intimidation during elections, restored law and order, and created a long era of comity between the races. The black version, beginning with W.E.B. Du Bois' Black Reconstruction (1935), examines the period more objectively and notes its achievements in establishing public school education, and numerous social and welfare institutions to benefit all the citizens. Other historians also evaluated Reconstruction against similar periods. Their work provided intellectual support for the Civil Rights Movement.Bruce E. Baker, What Reconstruction Meant: Historical Memory in the American South (2008) In the 1980s, social battles over the display of the Confederate flag following the achievements of the Civil Rights Movement were related to these differing interpretations and the blacks' nearly century of struggle to regain the exercise of constitutional rights lost to Conservative Democrats after Reconstruction. ==Conservative rule 1877‚Äì90== Wade Hampton III, the \\"Savior of South Carolina\\". The Democrats were led by General Wade Hampton III and other former Confederate veterans who espoused a return to the policies of the antebellum period. Known as the Conservatives, or the Bourbons, they favored a minimalist approach by the government and a conciliatory policy towards blacks while maintaining white supremacy. Also of interest to the Conservatives was the restoration of the University of South Carolina to its prominent prewar status as the leading institution of higher education in the state and the region. They closed the college before passing a law to restrict admission to whites only. The legislature designated Claflin College for higher education for blacks. (The Reconstruction legislature had opened the college to blacks and established supplemental programs to prepare them for study.) Once in power, the Democrats quickly consolidated their position and sought to unravel the legacy of the Radical Republicans. They pressured Republicans to resign from their positions, which included violence and intimidation by members of the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group described the historian George Rabe as the \\"military arm of the Democratic Party,\\" who also worked to suppress black voting. Within a year both the legislative and judiciary were firmly in the control of the Democrats. The Democrats launched investigations into the corruption and frauds committed by Republicans during Reconstruction. They dropped the charges when the Federal government dropped its charges against whites accused of violence in the 1876 election campaign. With their position secure, the Democrats next tackled the state debt. Many Democrats from the upcountry, led by General Martin Gary, who had developed the Edgefield Plan for targeted violence to take back the state, pushed for the entire state debt to be canceled, but Gary was opposed by Charleston holders of the bonds. A compromise moderated by Wade Hampton was achieved and by October 1882, the state debt was reduced to $6.5 million. Other legislative initiatives by the Conservatives benefited its primary supporters, the planters and business class. Taxes across the board were reduced, and funding was cut for public social and educational programs that assisted poor whites and blacks. Oral contracts were made to be legally binding, breach of contract was enforced as a criminal offense, and those in debt to planters could be forced to work off their debt. In addition, the University of South Carolina along with The Citadel were reopened to elite classes and generously supported by the state government. By the late 1880s, the agrarian movement swept through the state and encouraged subsistence farmers to assert their political rights. They pressured the legislature to establish an agriculture college. Reluctantly the legislature complied by adding an agriculture college to the University of South Carolina in 1887. Ben Tillman inspired the farmers to demand a separate agriculture college isolated from the politics of Columbia. The Conservatives finally gave them one in 1889. ==Tillman era and disfranchisement, 1890‚Äì1914== Statue of Ben Tillman, one of the most outspoken advocates of racism to serve in Congress. In 1890, Ben Tillman set his sights on the gubernatorial contest. The farmers rallied behind his candidacy and Tillman easily defeated the conservative nominee, A.C. Haskell. The conservatives failed to grasp the strength of the farmers' movement in the state. The planter elite no longer engendered automatic respect for having fought in the Civil War. Not only that, but Tillman's \\"humorous and coarse speech appealed to a majority no more delicate than he in matters of taste.\\"Lander, Ernest: A History of South Carolina 1865-1960, p. 34. University of South Carolina Press, 1970. The Tillman movement succeeded in enacting a number of Tillman's proposals and pet projects. Among those was the crafting of a new state constitution and a state dispensary system for alcohol. Tillman held a \\"pathological fear of Negro rule.\\"Lander, Ernest: A History of South Carolina 1865-1960, p. 40. University of South Carolina Press, 1970. White elites created a new constitution with provisions to suppress voting by blacks and poor whites following the 1890 model of Mississippi, which had survived an appeal to the US Supreme Court. They followed what was known as the Mississippi Plan, which had survived a US Supreme Court challenge. Disfranchisement was chiefly accomplished through provisions related to making voter registration more difficult, such as poll taxes and literacy tests, which in practice adversely affected African Americans and poor whites. After promulgation of the new Constitution of 1895, voting was for more than sixty years essentially restricted to whites, establishing a one-party Democratic state. White Democrats benefited by controlling a House of Representatives apportionment based on the total state population, although the number of voters had been drastically reduced. Blacks were excluded from the political system in every way, including from serving in local offices and on juries. During Reconstruction, black legislators had been a majority in the lower house of the legislature. The new requirements, applied under white authority, led to only about 15,000 of the 140,000 eligible blacks qualifying to register.South Carolina‚Äôs Congressmen: She May Lose Four of Them Through Disfranchising Blacks, 15 November 1896, The New York Times accessed 5 Mar 2008 In practice, many more blacks were prohibited from voting by the subjective voter registration process controlled by white registrars. In addition, the Democratic Party primary was restricted to whites only. By October 1896, there were 50,000 whites registered, but only 5,500 blacks, in a state in which blacks were the majority.George Brown Tindall. South Carolina Negroes, 1877-1900. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2003, p. 88 The 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disfranchisement: a total of 782,509 African Americans made up more than 58 percent of the state's population, essentially without any representation.Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia , accessed 15 Mar 2008 The political loss affected educated and illiterate men alike. It meant that without their interests represented, blacks were unfairly treated within the state. They were unable to serve on juries; segregated schools and services were underfunded; law enforcement was dominated by whites. African Americans did not recover the ability to exercise suffrage and political rights until the Civil Rights Movement won passage of Federal legislation in 1964 and 1965. The state Dispensary, described as \\"Ben Tillman's Baby\\", was never popular in the state, and violence broke out in Darlington over its enforcement. In 1907, the Dispensary Act was repealed. In 1915, the legal sale of alcohol was prohibited by referendum. Tillman's influence on the politics of South Carolina began to wane after he was elected by the legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1895. The Conservatives recaptured the legislature in 1902. The elite planter, Duncan Clinch Heyward, won the gubernatorial election. He made no substantial changes and Heyward continued to enforce the Dispensary Act at great difficulty. The state continued its rapid pace of industrialization, which gave rise to a new class of white voters, the cotton mill workers. White sharecroppers and mill workers coalesced behind the candidacy of Tillmanite Cole Blease in the gubernatorial election of 1910. They believed that Blease was including them as an important part of the political force of the state. Once in office, however, Blease did not initiate any policies that were beneficial to the mill workers or poor farmers. Instead, his four years in office were highly erratic in behavior. This helped to pave the way for a progressive, Richard I. Manning, to win the governorship in 1914.Lander, Ernest: A History of South Carolina 1865-1960, p. 53. University of South Carolina Press, 1970. ==Economic booms and busts== In the 1880s Atlanta editor Henry W. Grady won attention in the state for his vision of a \\"New South\\", a South based on the modern industrial model. By now, the idea had already struck some enterprising South Carolinians that the cotton they were shipping north could also be processed in South Carolina mills. The idea was not new; in 1854, De Bow's Commercial Review of the South & West had boasted to investors of South Carolina's potential for manufacturing, citing its three lines of railroads, inexpensive raw materials, non-freezing rivers, and labor pool. Slavery was so profitable before 1860 that it absorbed available capital and repelled Northern investors, but now the time for industrialization was at hand. By 1900, the textile industry was established in upland areas, which had water-power and an available white labor force, comprising men, women, and children willing to move from hard- scrabble farms to mill towns.David L. Carlton, Mill and Town in South Carolina, 1880-1920 (1982) In 1902, the Charleston Expedition drew visitors from around the world. President Theodore Roosevelt, whose mother had attended school in Columbia, called for reconciliation of still simmering animosities between the North and the South. The Progressive Movement came to the state with Governor Richard Irvine Manning III in 1914. The expansion of bright-leaf tobacco around 1900 from North Carolina brought an agricultural boom. This was broken by the Great Depression starting in 1929, but the tobacco industry recovered and prospered until near the end of the 20th century. Cotton remained by far the dominant crop, despite low prices. The arrival of boll weevil infestation sharply reduced acreage, and especially yields. Farmers shifted to other crops.John Fraser Hart, \\"The Demise of King Cotton,\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Sep 1977, Vol. 67 Issue 3, pp. 307‚Äì322 Black sharecroppers and laborers began heading North in large numbers in the era of World War I, a Great Migration that continued for the rest of the century, as they sought higher wages and much more favorable political conditions.Steven Hahn, A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration (2005) ==Civil Rights Movement== As early as 1948, when Strom Thurmond ran for President on the States Rights ticket, South Carolina whites were showing discontent with the Democrats' post-World War II continuation of the New Deal's federalization of power. South Carolina blacks had problems with the Southern version of states' rights; by 1940, the voter registration provisions written into the 1895 constitution effectively still limited African American voters to 3,000‚Äîonly 0.8 percent of those of voting age in the state.Lawrence Edward Carter. Walking Integrity: Benjamin Elijah Mays, Mentor to Martin Luther King Jr.. Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1998, pp. 43‚Äì44 African Americans had not been able to elect a representative since the 19th century. Hundreds of thousands left the state for industrial cities in the Great Migration of the 20th century. By 1960, during the Civil Rights Movement, South Carolina had a population of 2,382,594, of whom nearly 35%, or 829,291 were African Americans, who had been without representation for 60 years.[fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state/php Historical Census Browser, 1960 Census, Accessed 13 Mar 2008] In addition, the state enforced legal racial segregation in public facilities. Non-violent action against segregation began in Rock Hill in 1961, when nine black Friendship Junior College students took seats at the whites-only lunch counter at a downtown McCrory's and refused to leave.Siglas, Mike (2003). South Carolina. Emeryville, CA: Avalon Travel Publishing. . When police arrested them, the students were given the choice of paying $200 fines or serving 30 days of hard labor in the York County jail. The Friendship Nine, as they became known, chose the latter, gaining national attention in the Civil Rights Movement because of their decision to use the \\"jail, no bail\\" strategy. ==Recent eventsEconomic change=== The rapid decline of agriculture in the state has been one of the most important developments since the 1960s. As late as 1960, more than half the state's cotton was picked by hand. Over the next twenty years, mechanization eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in rural counties. By 2000, only 24,000 farms were left, with fewer than 2% of the population; many others lived in rural areas on what were once farms, but they commuted to non-farm jobs. Cotton was no longer king, as cotton lands were converted into timberlands. Until the 1970s rural areas had controlled the legislature. After 1972, both houses of the state legislature were reapportioned into single-member districts, ending another rural advantage. Coupled with the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protected voting for African Americans, the reapportionment transformed South Carolina politics. The South Carolina Democratic party, which dominated the state for nearly a century after Reconstruction, due to suppression of black voting, began to decline at the state and county level with the 1994 elections. The majority white voters had been supporting Republican presidential candidates since the late 1960s and gradually elected the party candidates to local and state offices as well. Republicans won all but one statewide constitutional office, and control of the state house of representatives. Fritz Hollings, governor 1959‚Äì63, who was a key supporter of development, executed a campaign to promote industrial training programs and implemented a state-wide economic development strategy. The end of the Cold War in 1990 brought the closing of military installations, such as the naval facilities in North Charleston, which Rep. Mendel Rivers had long sponsored. The quest for new jobs became a high state priority. Starting in 1975 the state used its attractive climate, lack of powerful labor unions, and low wage rates to attract foreign investment in factories, including Michelin, which located its U.S. headquarters in the state. The stretch of Interstate 85 from the North Carolina line to Greenville became \\"UN Alley\\" as international companies opened operations. Tourism became a major industry, especially in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in the billions of dollars of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21‚Äì22, 1989. Charleston was more used to hurricanes; historical preservation groups immediately stepped in to begin salvage and reconstruction, with the result that one year after Hugo, the city was virtually returned to normal. By the late 1980s, however, the state's economic growth rate flattened. South Carolina's development plan focused on offering low taxes and attracting low-wage industries, but the state's low levels of education have failed to attract high wage, high tech industries.Lacy K. Ford, Jr., and R. Phillip Stone, \\"Economic Development and Globalization in South Carolina,\\" Southern Cultures, Spring 2007, Vol. 13#1, pp. 18‚Äì50 In 1991, under the leadership of then Governor Carroll A. Campbell, the state successfully recruited BMW's (Bavarian Motor Works) only U.S. auto factory to the city of Greer, in Spartanburg County. Second-tier and third- tier auto parts suppliers to BMW likewise established assembly and distribution facilities near the factory, creating a significant shift in manufacturing from textiles to automotive. In 2009, the state outbid the state of Washington for a giant new Boeing plant, to be constructed in North Charleston. Boeing must create at least 3,800 jobs and invest more than $750 million within seven years to take advantage of the various tax inducements, worth $450 million.John McDermott and Yvonne Wenger, Boeing lands in North Charleston Charleston Post and Courier October 28, 2009 ===Politics=== In the 1970s, South Carolina white voters elected the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction. In 1987 and 1991, the state elected and reelected Governor Carroll Campbell, another Republican. Many politicians switched from the Democratic Party to the GOP, including David Beasley, a former Democrat who claimed to have undergone a spiritual rebirth; he was elected governor as a Republican. In 1996, Beasley surprised citizens by announcing that he could not justify keeping the Confederate flag flying over the capitol. He said that a \\"spate of racially motivated violence compelled him to reconsider the politics and symbolism of the Confederate flag, and he concluded it should be moved.\\"\\"Profile in Courage Award, David Beasley\\", JFK Library Traditionalists were further surprised when Bob Jones III, head of Bob Jones University, announced he held the same view. Beasley was upset for reelection in 1998 by the little-known Jim Hodges, a state assemblyman from Lancaster. Hodges attacked Beasley's opposition to the creation of a state lottery to support education. Hodges called for a fresh tax base to improve public education. Despite Hodges' unwillingness to join Beasley in his opposition to flying the Confederate flag, the NAACP announced its support for Hodges. (At the same time the NAACP demanded a boycott of conferences in the state over the flag issue). Hodges reportedly accepted millions in contributions from the gambling industry, which some estimated spent a total of $10 million to defeat Beasely.Michael Graham, \\"The Luckiest Politician in America?\\", The National Review, May 24, 2000, accessed 24 Mar 2008 After the election, with public opinions steadfastly against video gambling, Hodges asked for a statewide referendum on the issue. He claimed that he would personally join the expected majority in saying \\"no\\" on legalized gambling, but vowed not to campaign against it. Critics in both parties suggested that Hodges' debts to the state's gambling interests were keeping him from campaigning against legalized gambling. The state constitution does not provide for referendums except for ratification of amendments. State legislators shut down the state's video casinos soon after Hodges took office. Upon his election, Hodges announced that he agreed with Beasley's increasingly popular compromise proposal on the Confederate flag issue. He supported the flag's transfer to a Confederate monument on the State House's grounds. Many South Carolinians agreed with this position as the only solution. Further, they admired Hodges' solution to nuclear waste shipments to the state. Hodges alienated moderate voters sufficiently so that in 2002, most of the state's major newspapers supported the Republican Mark Sanford to replace him. Hodges was held responsible for the state's mishandling of the Hurricane Floyd evacuation in 1999. By 2002, most of the funds from Hodges' \\"South Carolina Education Lottery\\" were used to pay for college scholarships, rather than to improve impoverished rural and inner-city schools. Religious leaders denounced the lottery as taxing the poor to pay for higher education for the middle class. In the lottery's first year, Hodges' administration awarded $40 million for \\"LIFE Scholarships\\", granted to any South Carolinian student with a B average, graduation in the top 30% of the student's high school class, and an 1,100 SAT score. Hodges' administration awarded $5.8 million for \\"HOPE Scholarships\\", which had lower GPA requirements. Hodges lost his campaign for reelection in 2002 against the Republican conservative Mark Sanford, a former U.S. congressman from Sullivan's Island. Mark Sanford served two terms as governor from 2003 to 2011. He left office in the heat of a political scandal; while in office, Sanford took a trip to Argentina without anyone's knowing it, and he reportedly had an affair with a woman. Sanford later publicly apologized for the affair, but he and his wife, Jenny Sullivan, divorced in 2010. Sanford was elected to the United States House of Representatives from South Carolina's 1st District in May 2013, a position which he also held from 1995 to 2003. In 2012, Governor Nikki Haley appointed Tim Scott as one of South Carolina's two United States Senators. In 2014, Scott won election to the office and became the first African-American to serve as U.S. Senator from South Carolina since the Civil War era. In 2010, Nikki Haley, who took office as Governor of South Carolina in January 2011, became the first female to be elected governor. Additionally, Haley was the first person of Asian-Indian descent to be elected governor. Haley served from 2011 until 2017; President Donald Trump nominated her as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position which she accepted and was approved by the United States Senate. After Haley's resignation on January 24, 2017, Henry McMaster became the incumbent, 117th governor of South Carolina. ==See also== * Outline of South Carolina#History of South Carolina * African Americans in South Carolina * Colonial South and the Chesapeake * History of the East Coast of the United States * History of the Southern United States * Deep South * Black Belt in the American South * Irish slaves myth * Grand Model for the Province of Carolina * List of newspapers in South Carolina in the 18th century * Timeline of Charleston, South Carolina * Timeline of Columbia, South Carolina * Economy of South Carolina ==References== * Peirce, Neal R.

Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire. A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing. Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term was coined in 1903.Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition (2003). Shrubland species generally show a wide range of adaptations to fire, such as heavy seed production, lignotubers, and fire- induced germination. == Botanical structural form == In botany and ecology a shrub is defined as a much-branched woody plant less than 8 m high and usually with many stems. Tall shrubs are mostly 2‚Äì8 m high, small shrubs 1‚Äì2 m high and subshrubs less than 1 m high.Flora of New South Wales, Vol.4 ed. Gwen J. Harden, Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney A descriptive system widely adopted in Australia to describe different types of vegetation is based on structural characteristics based on plant life-form, plus the height and foliage cover of the tallest stratum or dominant species.Costermans, L. F. (1993) Native trees and shrubs of South-Eastern Australia. rev. ed. Prince Edward County, Ontario. For shrubs 2‚Äì8 m high the following structural forms result: * dense foliage cover (70‚Äì100%) ‚Äî closed-scrub * mid-dense foliage cover (30‚Äì70%) ‚Äî open-scrub * very sparse foliage cover (<10%) ‚Äî tall open shrubland For shrubs <2 m high the following structural forms result: * dense foliage cover (70‚Äì100%) ‚Äî closed-heath * mid-dense foliage cover (30‚Äì70%) ‚Äî open-heath * sparse foliage cover (10‚Äì30%) ‚Äî low shrubland * very sparse foliage cover (<10%) ‚Äî low open shrubland == Biome plant group == Fynbos in South Africa Similarly, shrubland is a category used to describe a type of biome plant group. In this context, shrublands are dense thickets of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs and small trees, called: * Chaparral in California * Matorral in Chile, Mexico, and Spain * Maquis in France and elsewhere around the Mediterranean * Macchia in Italy * Fynbos in South Africa * Cumberland Plain Woodland in Sydney, Australia * Kwongan in Southwest Australia * Cedar scrub in Texas Hill Country In some places shrubland is the mature vegetation type, and in other places the result of degradation of former forest or woodland by logging or overgrazing, or disturbance by major fires. A number of World Wildlife Fund biomes are characterized as shrublands, including: ;Desert scrublands The Nullarbor plain in Australia Xeric or desert scrublands occur in the world's deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregions, or in areas of fast-draining sandy soils in more humid regions. These scrublands are characterized by plants with adaptations to the dry climate, which include small leaves to limit water loss, thorns to protect them from grazing animals, succulent leaves or stems, storage organs to store water, and long taproots to reach groundwater. ;Mediterranean scrublands Mediterranean scrublands occur naturally in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biomes, located in the five Mediterranean climate regions of the world. Scrublands are most common near the seacoast, and have often adapted to the wind and salt air of the ocean. Low, soft-leaved scrublands around the Mediterranean Basin are known as garrigue in France, phrygana in Greece, tomillares in Spain, and batha in Israel. Northern coastal scrub and coastal sage scrub occur along the California coast, strandveld in the Western Cape of South Africa, coastal matorral in central Chile, and sand-heath and kwongan in Southwest Australia. ;Interior scrublands Interior scrublands occur naturally in semi-arid areas where soils are nutrient-poor, such as on the matas of Portugal which are underlain by Cambrian and Silurian schists. Florida scrub is another example of interior scrublands. ;Dwarf shrubs Moorland on Kilimanjaro Some vegetation types are formed of dwarf-shrubs: low-growing or creeping shrubs. These include the maquis and garrigues of Mediterranean climates, and the acid- loving dwarf shrubs of heathland and moorland. == See also == * Fynbos * Maquis * Prostrate shrub * Semi-desert * Shrub-steppe * Shrub swamp * Moorland == Notes and references == ","title":"Shrubland"},{"id":"2208844","text":"Sukumar Ray (, ; 30 October 1887 ‚Äì 10 September 1923) was a Bengali writer and poet from the Indian subcontinent. He is remembered mainly for his writings for the children. He was the son of children's story writer Upendrakishore Ray, the father of Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray and grandfather of Indian filmmaker Sandip Ray. ==Family History== According to the history of the Ray family, one of their ancestors, Shri Ramsunder Deo (Deb), was a native of Chakdah village in Nadia district of present-day West Bengal, India. In search of fortune he migrated to Sherpur in East Bengal. There he met Raja Gunichandra, the zamindar of Jashodal, at the zamindar house of Sherpur. King Gunichandra was immediately impressed by Ramsunder's beautiful appearance and sharp intellect and took Ramsunder with him to his zamindari estate. He made Ramsunder his son-in-law and granted him some property in Jashodal. From then on Ramsunder started living in Jashodal. His descendants migrated from there and settled down in the village of Masua in Katiadi upazila of Kishoreganj district.Sukumar Samagra Rachanabali 1, 1960, Asia Publishing Company, p 1Sukumar Ray: Jibankatha (Bengali Ed.), Hemanta Kumar Adhya, Pustak Bipani, Kolkata, 1990, p. 6 ==Early years== Sukumar Ray was born in a Brahmo family in Calcutta , British India (present day West Bengal) on 30 October 1887. His family hailed from Masua village of Mymensingh division of Eastern Bengal and Assam in British India, presently in Bangladesh. Sukumar's father Upendrakishore Ray was a famous Bengali writer, painter, violin player and composer, technologist, amateur astronomer and entrepreneur. Sukumar's mother Bidhumukhi Devi was daughter of Dwarkanath Ganguly. Sukumar Ray with his father Upendrakishore Ray, mother Bidhumukhi and five siblings. Born in the era which can be called the pinnacle of the Bengal Renaissance, he grew up in an environment that fostered his literary talents. His father was a writer of stories and popular science; painter and illustrator; musician and composer of songs; a technologist and hobbyist astronomer. Upendrakishore was also a close friend of Rabindranath Tagore, who directly influenced Sukumar. Among other family friends were Jagadish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Roy, Atul Prasad Sen etc. Upendrakishore studied the technology of blockmaking, conducted experiments, and set up a business of making blocks.

Before that he attended City College School, Surya Sen Street along with his classmate, famous funny character \\"Pagla Dashu\\" appeared in several of his penned story. He was trained in photography and printing technology in England at the School of Photo-Engraving and Lithography, London, and was a pioneer of photography and lithography in India. While in England, he also delivered lectures about the songs of Rabindranath before Tagore won the Nobel Prize. Meanwhile, Sukumar had also drawn acclaim as an illustrator. As a technologist, he also developed new methods of halftone blockmaking, and technical articles about this were published in journals in England. The Penrose Annual published two articles by Ray. While in the United Kingdom he joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1912 and remained a member until his death, gaining his Fellowship in 1922.Correspondence with Dr Michael Pritchard, Director-General, of The Royal Photographic Society, 1 December 2013. leftUpendrakishore started a publishing firm, U. Ray and Sons, which Sukumar and Subinay helped to run. While Sukumar went to England to learn printing technology, Upendrakishore purchased land, constructed a building, and set up a printing press with facilities for high- quality halftone colour blockmaking and printing. He launched the children's magazine, Sandesh, in May, 1913. Very soon after Sukumar's return from England his writings and sketches started appearing in Sandesh. After Upendrakishore died on 20 December 1915, Sukumar ran the printing and publishing businesses and the Sandesh for about eight years. His younger brother Subinoy helped him, and many relatives pitched in writing for \\"Sandesh\\".

Amazing sense of humor, sharp power of observation and unfathomed wit merged with a profound command on selection of words produced a class of humor which was equally approachable by children as well as the grown ups. Satyajit Ray, in the preface of the first edition of the compilation of Sukumar Ray's complete works in his centenary year, Sukumar Sahitya Samagra, wrote: After his father's death in 1915, Sukumar had to take over responsibility of publication of \\"Sandesh\\", and his creativity reached its pinnacle. The 45 limericks in Abol Tabol and many other creations published in Sandesh still amuse the readers of all ages. He created many characters in his prose and poems. Kaath Buro, Tash Goru, Huko Mukho Hangla, Kumro Potash etc. were fictitious characters, though they were very close to our known world. He himself described his works as the product of Kheyal Ros (‡¶π‡¶†‡¶æ‡ßé ‡¶á‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡¶æ;‡¶ù‡ßã‡¶Å‡¶ï/Wish; Whims; Freak; Fancy). ==Death== Sukumar Ray died on 10 September 1923 at his Garpar residence in Kolkata of severe infectious fever, leishmaniasis, for which there was no cure at the time. He left behind his widow and their only child, Satyajit, who was only two years old at that time. Satyajit Ray would later shoot a documentary on Sukumar Ray in 1987, 5 years before his own death. ==Bibliography== * Abol Tabol (The Weird and the Absurd) * Pagla Dashu (Crazy Dashu) * Khai-Khai (Eat-Eat) * Heshoram Hushiyarer Diary (The diary of Heshoram Hushiyar) (early science fiction parody)Early Bengali science fiction, Amardeep Singh, lehigh.edu * HaJaBaRaLa (Mumbo-Jumbo) * Jhalapala O Onanyo Natok (Cacophony and Other Plays) * Lakkhaner Shoktishel (The Weapon of Lakkhan) * Chalachittachanchari * Shabdakalpadrum * Bohurupi (Many personalities) * Abak Jalpan (Weird Drinking of Water 1914) * Bhasar Atyachar (Torture of Language 1915) * Desh-Bidesher Golpo (Tales from Many Lands) ==ReferencesComplete Sukumar Ray * \\"Drighangchu\\" by Sukumar Ray translation of short story in The Cafe Irreal Category:1887 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Bengali male poets Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:Bengali writers Category:Bengali- language writers Category:Bengali-language science fiction writers Category:Bengali zamindars Category:Culture of Kolkata Category:Indian children's writers Category:Indian illustrators Category:Indian children's book illustrators Category:Brahmos Category:19th-century Indian photographers Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Deaths from leishmaniasis Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:20th-century Indian novelists Category:20th-century Indian photographers Category:Photographers from West Bengal Category:Novelists from West Bengal Category:Poets from West Bengal ","title":"Sukumar Ray"},{"id":"2208853","text":"The Audi S6 is the high performance variant of the Audi A6, an executive car produced by German automaker Audi.AudiWorld.com North American S6 Model Guide - historical S6 specifications, prices, and options It went on sale in 1994, shortly after the \\"A6\\" designation was introduced, replacing the \\"100\\" nameplate. The original S6 (Ur-S6) was largely the same car as the outgoing, original Audi S4 (C4) (Ur-S4), with the only visible differences being new body-cladding and badging. In certain markets where the even-higher performance RS6 which is also based on the A6 is not sold, the S6 is the most powerful A6 trim there. The S6, like all Audi \\"S\\" models, is fitted as standard with Audi's trademark quattro four-wheel drive (4WD) system, the S6 using the Torsen-based permanent 4WD. __TOC__ ==C4 (Typ 4A, 1994‚Äì1997)== Audi S6 sedan S6 Avant Audi was restructuring their model lineup in early and mid-1990s, and in late 1994, began selling the fifth generation (C4) Audi 100 model, re-badged as the Audi A6. Wanting to keep a sports-saloon in their lineup, the company made small revisions to what was previously known as the Audi S4, renaming it the Audi S6; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi's smaller Volkswagen Group B platform-based Audi A4. As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the Ur-S6, derived from the German augmentive, \\"Urspr√ºnglich\\" (meaning: original). It was available as both a saloon/sedan (typ 4A5), and an \\"Avant\\" (typ 4A9) (estate/wagon) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia. Audi's trademark \\"procon-ten\\" safety system was standard fitment. ===C4 powertrain=== From its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a turbocharged inline five-cylinder petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a Bosch Motronic electronic engine control unit (ECU), producing a motive power output of at 5,900 rpm, and at around 1,950 rpm, whilst consuming high octane \\"Super Plus\\" 98RON unleaded petrol. This engine gave the S6 a top speed of , and a 0 to of 6.7 seconds; with being reached in 17.5 seconds. The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed manual transmission (five- speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic Torsen T-1 quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Audi made a high-performance, 4.2-litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder turbo. Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard, but kept the quattro four wheel drive. A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option. ===C4 brakes, wheels and tyres=== The C4 braking system included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear; with diameter by thick discs, with two-piston floating Girling calipers bearing the interlocking four-ringed Audi logo, and four individual pads per caliper up front, and by discs with Lucas single- piston sliding calipers at the rear. Bosch Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with EDS was also standard. Standard wheels were 7¬ΩJx16 \\"Avus\\" cast aluminium alloy wheels with 225/50 R16 tyres. Later cars received 8Jx17 \\"Avus\\" wheels with 255/40 R17 tyres. An optional 7¬ΩJx15 five-arm alloy wheel, with 215/60 R15 tyres, an 8Jx16 five double-spoke alloy, an 8Jx17 10-spoke alloy were also available. ===Audi S6 PLUS=== As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 PLUS was briefly available to European customers. The S6 PLUS, developed by Audi's wholly owned high performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH, was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997). A total of 952 cars were produced‚Äì855 Avant, and 97 saloons. It was powered by another version of the 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2-litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the Audi S8 as AKH). Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the internal combustion engine, increasing the motive power to . It was only available with a revised six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111. Further revisions were made to the suspension, brakes and wheels. The front brake discs were enlarged to in diameter by thick. Standard wheels were 8Jx17 \\"Avus\\" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available. With so much power on tap, the S6 Plus saloon could reach from a standstill in 5.6 seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7 seconds, making it comparable in terms of acceleration to vehicles like the Porsche 944 Turbo. Hella xenon high intensity discharge (HID) headlamps (still with the C4s triple bulb design, only low beam) were available as an option. ==C5 (Typ 4B, 1999‚Äì2003)== Audi S6 sedan Audi S6 Avant In late 1997, Audi introduced an all-new range of Audi A6 models, based on the Volkswagen Group C5 platform. A new Audi S6, now officially known as the Audi S6 quattro appeared in 1999, to complement its A6 platform-mate. It was available in a four-door saloon/sedan and a five-door Avant (estate/wagon). In North America, the Avant bodystyle was the only version available. The vehicle could accelerate from standstill to in 5.7 seconds, and from 0 to in 21.7 seconds. The top speed was electronically governed to . This generation of S6 went out of production in 2003. ===C5 powertrain=== The engine was a new rubber-hydro mounted all-aluminium alloy 4.2-litre 40-valve (five valves per cylinder) 90¬∞ V8 (parts code: 077, identification codes: AQJ [Sept 99-May 1], ANK [Sept 00-onwards]). It had double overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank and solenoid-operated magnesium two-stage variable intake manifold. It displaced , and was rated at at 6,600 rpm, producing of torque at 3,400 rpm. It satisfied the European Union EU3 emissions standard, and was managed by a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU) with manifold- sited sequential fuel injection, mapped direct ignition with eight individual spark coils, Bosch longlife spark plugs, four heated lambda sensors and two catalytic converters, cylinder-selective knock control and a Bosch \\"E-Gas\\" drive by wire throttle. The engine was cooled with the aid of two electric cooling fans, replacing the single viscous fan of earlier models. An oil- cooled six-speed manual transmission (parts code: 01E, identification code: EEY) was standard, with gear ratios as follows: 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730; final drive: 4.111. An optional ZF 5HP24A five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was also available (parts code: 01L, identification codes: EFN [Sept 99-May 1], FBD [June 00-onwards]) with gear ratios as follows: 1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.508, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.803; and final drive ratio: 2.909). The automatic included steering wheel mounted paddle shifters, and a \\"Dynamic Shift Program\\" (DSP) for improved gear selection based on driving conditions.(paddle shift optional) Torsen T-1 based dynamic quattro permanent four-wheel drive was also standard. Both front and rear axles utilised \\"Electronic Differential Lock\\" (EDL), which is a function of the Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme. ===C5 suspension and steering=== Compared to its A6 sibling, the suspension on the S6 was stiffened and lowered by , and utilised gas-pressurised shock absorbers. ZF rack and pinion \\"servotronic\\" speed-sensitive power steering was standard. ===C5 brakes, wheels and tyres=== Brakes consisted of radially vented brake discs front and rear. The fronts are sized at diameter by thick, and are clamped by Lucas HP2 four-piston calipers. At the rear, the discs are by , and use a Lucas single-piston sliding caliper. Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) completed the brake system. Wheels are 8Jx17\\" cast alloy \\"Avus\\" 6-spoke alloy wheels, with 255/40 ZR17 tyres. Mine was delivered standard with 19\\" Avis 6 spoke and 245'35/zr19 tyre's ===C5 body and interior=== The body panels were largely based on the Audi A6 4.2 model, with slightly flared wheel arches and door sills, with the bonnet (hood) and front wings being constructed from aluminium. Other features included S6 badging, bolstered seats (optional Recaro seats), polished aluminium exterior door mirror housings, unique front grille, and rear bootlid/tailgate spoiler. ===Audi RS 6 (C5)=== A higher performance Audi RS 6 was also available from 2002 to 2004. It was built by Audi's high performance private subsidiary quattro GmbH. It used a twin-turbo (\\"biturbo\\") version of the 4.2-litre V8 engine (identification code: BCY). Power output was at 5,700 to 6,400 (rpm), and torque was from 1,950 to 5,600 rpm. The only transmission was a five-speed tiptronic automatic. Wheels and tyres were upgraded to , or (5/15 arm design), and there was the \\"Dynamic Ride Control\\" (DRC) system available for the suspension, which featured diagonally interlinked shock absorbers to give better body control during extreme cornering, acceleration and braking. Compared to the standard S6, the suspension was lowered by . The brake discs were ventilated and upgraded to at the front and at the rear. It can accelerate from 0- in 4.6 seconds. 0- times are 16.6 seconds for the saloon and 16.8 seconds for the Avant. ==C6 (Typ 4F, 2006‚Äì2011)== Audi S6 sedan Audi S6 Avant The Audi S6 5.2 FSI quattro (Typ 4F) was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January. The high-performance version of the C6 Audi A6, the S6 uses the Volkswagen Group C6 platform, and is available in saloon/sedan and Avant (estate/wagon) bodystyles. Factory production started in June 2006. A facelifted version of the S6 was released in late 2008 for the 2009 model year. In 2010, the S6 gained Audi's third- generation MMI electronics controller and real-time traffic information. ===C6 powertrain=== Audi C6 S6 V10 engine The engine in the C6 S6 is an even firing all-aluminium alloy Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) 40-valve (four valves per cylinder) 90¬∞ V10 (parts code: 07L, identification code: BXA). Compared with the 5.0-litre V10 found in the Lamborghini Gallardo, Audi's variant has a longer stroke and wider bore which increases the displacement of the engine so that it produces more torque at lower revs and is thus more suitable for the larger and heavier S6. It produces at 6,800 rpm and of torque from 3,000 to 4,000 rpm. It uses twin chain-driven double overhead camshafts with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust valves. The engine is managed by a Bosch Motronic MED 9.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), which controls the mapped direct ignition, ten individual spark coils, common rail cylinder- direct sequential multi-point fuel injection, and drive-by-wire throttle. A ZF 6HP26 six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code: 09E, identification codes: JBW, JMS, KHD, JLL) (gear ratios - 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691), with steering wheel- mounted \\"paddle-shifters\\" is the only transmission available. Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive - initially with the T-1 symmetrical differential, and from 2007 model year with the latest 40:60 front:rear asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 differential, is standard. The final drive ratio is 3.801. Traction is assisted \\"Electronic Differential Lock\\" (EDL) and \\"Anti- Slip Regulation\\" (ASR) (commonly known as traction control system) - both functions of the Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme. The same engine is used in the latest Audi D3 S8, but in a higher state of tune where it develops , as the S6 is not to be positioned above the S8 in output. With the discontinuation of the S8 5.2 FSI after the 2009 model year and the RS 6 5.0 TFSI in late 2010, the S6 5.2 FSI and R8 5.2 FSI were the remaining Audi vehicles that have V10 engines. The S6 5.2 FSI was discontinued after the 2011 model year, shortly before the release of the 2012 Audi A6 (C7). For the sprint from rest to , the S6 saloon takes 5.2 seconds, with the quarter mile passing in 13.5 seconds. Top speed is electronically limited to . However a test by Edmunds found that the S6 takes 5.7-seconds to reach 60 mph (97 km/h), a full second or so behind the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG (which are the S6's closest competitors in North America, since the RS6 is not sold there), and that the 2009 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI (a supercharged 3.0L V6) has almost equivalent performance to the S6 5.2 FSI. Yet, in a 2007 track test by Road & Track, the C6 S6 went from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.1 seconds, while it covered the quarter-mile in 13.5 seconds. Despite its heft at 4,500 pounds, the S6 has quick reflexes and agility, with the assistance of Audi's quattro system. ===C6 brakes, wheels and tyres=== The brakes consist of radially ventilated discs front and rear. The fronts are sized at in diameter by thick, and are clamped by gloss black painted Continental Teves two-piston sliding calipers. The rear discs are by thick, and use gloss black Girling-TRW single piston sliding calipers with an integrated electro-mechanical parking brake. A Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme, with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) completed the brake system. Standard alloy wheels consist of 9Jx19\\" cast aluminium alloy \\"5-arm wing design\\", shod with Continental SportContact2 265/35 ZR19 tyres. An optional 8¬ΩJx18\\" cast alloy \\"S design\\" with 255/40 ZR18 tyres (either Continental SportContact2 or Bridgestone Potenza RE050A) are also available. A direct-acting Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is also standard. ===C6 other features=== The S6 features two rows of five distinctive LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) along each side of the front bumper air intakes which indicates the 10-cylinder engine as a point of differentiation from other A6 models. Bi-Xenon high-intensity discharge (HID) adaptive headlights which swivel around corners complement the LED DRLs. ===Audi RS 6 (C6)=== As with the previous generation, this C6 platform also generated an RS 6 version available for the model years 2008 to 2010, again developed and produced by quattro GmbH. This version of the RS6 included a 5.0-litre () 90¬∞ V10 twin- turbocharged (\\"biturbo\\"), Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V10 engine, which produced and . Available in both Avant and saloon bodystyles, it was Audi's single most powerful car.Audi UK - The New Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 1. 02/08Audi UK - Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 2. 05/08 Official performance figures for acceleration from 0- are 4.6 seconds for the Avant and 4.5 seconds for the saloon. ==C7 (Typ 4G, 2012‚Äì2018)== The Audi S6 4.0 TFSI quattro and its mechanical twin S7 were launched as a 2013 models, a year after the C7 Audi A6 and Audi A7 were released. The Audi S6 and S7 are powered by a 4.0L DOHC twin- turbo V8 engine mated to a 7-speed S-tronic Double Clutch Gearbox. This engine makes and of torque, plus there is a cylinder-deactivation system and a stop- start system for improved fuel economy. This was later upgraded to for 2016. The 2013 Audi A8 shares the same engine, while the 2012 Audi S8 has a variant of the powerplant in a higher state of tune making and of torque, both mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. The V8 performance option for the regular Audi A6, found in the 2004-11 Audi A6 4.2 FSI, has been discontinued and the S6 takes over as the engine upgrade. The S6 now compares more closely with the BMW 550i and Mercedes-Benz E550, which also use twin-turbo V8 engines and have available all-wheel drive. The BMW with , and the E550 with . (The 2013 BMW 550i xDrive starts at US$65,595 while the 2013 Audi S6 has an MRSP of US$72,795). UK sales began in May, with a starting price of ¬£53,995 for the saloon, and ¬£56,050 for the Avant.

Sabhal M√≤r is an independent Academic Partner in the federal University of the Highlands and Islands. Uniquely, its sole medium of instruction on degree courses is Scottish Gaelic. Since its foundation in 1973 Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig has played a crucial role in the linguistic and cultural renaissance of Gaelic in Scotland. The college enjoys an international reputation for the study of the history and literature of the G√†idhealtachd, past and present; for research into political, educational, and community aspects of minority language maintenance and revitalisation; and for its engagement with Gaelic creative arts, as well as with broadcast and online media. Sabhal M√≤r's research base has been further strengthened to take in sociolinguistics, through the Soillse initiative; corpus planning and historical lexicography, through the St√≤rdata N√†iseanta na G√†idhlig/Gaelic Terminology Database and the Faclair na G√†idhlig/Dictionary of Scottish Gaelic projects; and toponomy, through the Ainmean-√Äite na h-Alba/Gaelic Place-Names of Scotland advisory partnership, all based at the college. Research capacity is underpinned by the Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig Library with its internationally important collections of material related to Gaelic and to the Highlands, and further complemented by the proximity of two major Highland archives: those of MacDonald of Sleat in the Museum of the Isles by Armadale Castle, and the MacLeod papers in Dunvegan Castle. Through academic collaboration and student exchanges, the college maintains close links with partner institutions in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and Nova Scotia. With established residencies for writers, artists, musicians, and dramatists; its prominent degree courses in media and traditional music; its hosting of the national folklore digitisation project Tobar an Dualchais/Kist o Riches; and F√†s, its ¬£8-million centre for creative industries, Sabhal M√≤r fulfils an important cultural remit both in the Highlands and in Scotland more generally. ==HistoryBeginnings=== In early 1972 Iain Noble, financier, merchant banker, and Gaelic activist, bought the northern portion of the Sleat estate, in the south of the Isle of Skye, from the then owner, Godfrey Macdonald, 8th Baron Macdonald of Sleat. Noble's vision for his new Eilean Iarmain estate was inspired by a visit he had made to the Faroe Islands in the late 1960s. There he had been impressed by how the local linguistic and cultural renaissance had helped to create what was at the time a correspondingly dynamic economic and creative revival: Noble set about putting his ideals into practice. Gaelic speakers were recruited and employed in running new fishing and textile enterprises; a bar was set up beside the estate headquarters as a Gaelic-oriented social and cultural focus for the district; and he was soon involved in a series of wrangles with Inverness County Council over bilingual Gaelic roadsigns on his land. Noble was also inspired by the idea of renovating a semi-derelict farmhouse steading at Ostaig as a Gaelic cultural centre. Plans at first focused around the establishment of a Gaelic library, quickly growing through donations to become the largest public collection of Gaelic-related material in the Hebrides. In Noble's words, however: ===Creation=== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig was established as a charitable trust in 1973, \\"as an educational institute, with a special emphasis on Gaelic educational functions\\",West Highland Free Press (21 September 1973), quoted in Hutchinson (2005), page 16 with a longer-term vision of establishing a Gaelic-medium college and research centre offering vocational further education, as well as opportunities for Gaelic learners to develop their fluency. Four urrasairean or trustees were appointed: Iain Noble, poet Sorley Maclean, Donald Ruaraidh Macdonald of Portree High School, and Gordon Barr, then a lecturer in biochemistry at the University of Dundee. Barr was to take a year's sabbatical, from June 1973 to September 1974, as the college's first fear-sti√πiridh or director. A two-week summer course for Gaelic learners, attended by 22 students from Scotland, Britain, and further afield, was held in September 1973 in association with An Comunn G√†idhealach.Gossen, Andrew Adam (2001) \\"Agents of a modern Gaelic Scotland: Curriculum, Change, and Challenge at Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig, the Gaelic College of Scotland\\". Harvard University, unpublished PhD thesis Other activities included a lecture series, a Gaelic playgroup, night classes for Gaelic learners, and events for Gaelic-speaking schoolchildren. The Scottish Arts Council sponsored a Gaelic writer-in-residence, Catr√¨ona Montgomery from Roag near Dunvegan. In November 1974 the charitable Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation offered Sabhal M√≤r a three-year grant towards the cost of a full-time director. Farquhar MacLennan, a teacher from Raasay accepted the post the following spring. During the early years of the college's existence the trustees‚Äô energy was directed towards fundraising, improving the dilapidated Ostaig steading, expanding summer courses in Gaelic and music, developing links with equivalent institutions in Ireland, Wales, and Canada, and hosting an annual conference. In July 1978 the trustees of the college established a committee to examine the possibilities of delivering two-year full-time diploma courses through Gaelic. Two years later the committee recommended the establishment of practically-oriented business and administration courses focusing upon the situation in the Highlands, but employing comparisons with similar regions. Following a fundraising drive to pay for the necessary building improvements, the first two-year HND diploma course, in Business and G√†idhealtachd Studies, began in 1983 under the new college principal, Se√°n √ì Drisceoil, appointed on a three-year secondment from √ödar√°s na Gaeltachta in Ireland. Seven students, all native speakers from the Western Isles, comprised the first intake. Despite continuing financial problems, the college expanded its programme to take in two new HNDs: Business and Information Studies in 1987, and Business and Secretarial Studies, subsequently Business Studies with Office Technology, in 1988. ===1980s and 90s=== During the 1980s the full-time student body at Sabhal M√≤r numbered on average ten a year. Prospects for future development, however, remained restricted as long as the college focused solely on recruiting business students with fluent Gaelic. Opportunities for significant expansion arose at the end of the decade with the establishment of Comataidh Telebhisein G√†idhlig, endowed by the government with an annual grant of ¬£9.5 million. With its business focus, and existing expertise in ICT,MacLeod, Marsaili (2008) 'Revitalising rural Europe's indigenous languages: \\"technologisation\\" and the Gaelic language', in Grete Rusten & Sarah Skerratt (eds), Information and Communication Technologies in Rural Society: Being Rural in a Digital Age, pp. 125‚Äì52. Abingdon: Routledge. Sabhal M√≤r was well placed to take advantage of the demand for a major increase in Gaelic-speaking personnel in the Scottish media. Under its new director Norman Gillies, the college was able to secure funding from the Scottish Office, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scottish Television, and Grampian Television for the construction of a ¬£1.4 million accommodation block, √Ärainn Ostaig (Ostaig Campus), with 36 student bedrooms, teaching and administration spaces, dining facilities, and a television studio. √Ärainn Ostaig opened in the autumn of 1993. The same year, the college launched what would prove a remarkably popular postgraduate diploma in Gaelic Broadcasting. The early 1990s saw a series of significant developments at Sabhal M√≤r, including the establishment in 1992 of the L√®irsinn Research Centre and the C√†nan creative agency. The growth of college accommodation allowed a massive increase in summer courses and short courses. The introduction in 1994 of a new HNC in Gaelic and Communications, a diploma designed to boost the supply of teachers to the growing number of Gaelic medium units in primary schools across the country, further underlined the shift in the college's position in response to the increasing need for qualified Gaelic speakers in the media and education throughout Scotland. During the rest of the decade there would be a major expansion of the college campus and a sizeable growth in student numbers. The latter was the consequence of two new one-year HNC diplomas established in 1997 ‚Äì the innovative language immersion C√πrsa Comais intended to enable Gaelic learners to attain comprehension and fluency within a year, and the HNC in Gaelic Performing Arts designed to meet an apparent need for more Gaelic television actors in the future ‚Äì and the introduction of university-level BA courses the following year. The most significant influence on the college's long-term strategic thinking during the 1990s was the prospect of participating as a partner college in the recently proposed University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) network, and thus being able to offer full-time degree courses. The involvement of Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig from 1995 onwards was crucial for the credibility of the wider UHI project. Its Gaelic identity helped to lend the scheme a much needed cultural distinctiveness rooted in the region. In a more concrete sense, the surprising ‚Äòconversion‚Äô of the then Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to the merit of the UHI scheme in October 1995 was primarily due to a recent visit to Sabhal M√≤r during which he had been given a demonstration of the efficacy of new ISDN communications technologies in linking widely dispersed colleges into a single university network. Forsyth's remarkable volte-face gave the UHI proposal the vital government support required to make a plausible submission to the lottery- funded Millennium Commission.Newlands, David, and Parker, Margaret. 'The prospects and potential of a new university in the Highlands and Islands', Scottish Affairs, 21 (Autumn, 1997), pp. 78‚Äì94. The project bid was funded in full: an award of ¬£33.35 million allowed construction of new college buildings throughout the network, in preparation for envisaged university status. Among these buildings was the ¬£6 million second campus at Sabhal M√≤r, √Ärainn Chaluim Chille (Columba Campus). The site, two hundred yards along the road from the original Ostaig site, occupied part of a site donated by Ellice MacDonald, chairman of Clan Donald Trust, that had previously been earmarked as the site for a new township, Bail‚Äô √ôr Ostaig, the subject of an unsuccessful ¬£15.75 million bid by Sabhal M√≤r itself to the Millennium Commission. In September 1998 √Ärainn Chaluim Chille, with teaching facilities, library, dining room, lecture/sports/concert hall, and 31 student bedrooms, was completed; the following year saw the opening of the iconic tower L√≤chran an D√≤mhnallaich (the MacDonald Beacon), containing 31 further bedrooms and partly funded from a ¬£900,000 end-of-year surplus wrangled from the Scottish Office by the then Minister for Industry, Education and Gaelic, Brian Wilson. In 1997 the college commenced its first BA courses, C√†nan is Cultar na G√†idhlig (Gaelic Language and Culture), and G√†idhlig agus Iomall a‚Äô Chuain Siar (Gaelic and the Atlantic Rim), later G√†idhlig is Leasachadh (Gaelic and Development). These were upgraded into Honours courses in 2002, when a further BA course, G√†idhlig agus na Meadhanan (Gaelic and Media Studies), was introduced. Another BA (Hons) course, G√†idhlig agus Ce√≤l Traidiseanta (Gaelic and Traditional Music), began in 2006, while the following year the teacher-training MA (Hons) course in G√†idhlig agus Foghlam (Gaelic and Education) began, in collaboration with the University of Aberdeen. These were complemented by highly successful distance learning language courses: from 2000, the award-winning C√πrsa Inntrigidh for beginners, and six years later, the C√πrsa Adhartais for advanced learners. The college also offers an innovative master's degree, the MSc in Cultar D√πthchasach agus Eachdraidh na G√†idhealtachd (Material Culture and G√†idhealtachd History), begun in 2005 as an MA in Cultar D√πthchasach agus an √Ärainneachd (Material Culture and the Environment). Since the University of the Highlands and Islands project was granted university status and thus degree-granting powers in March 2011, the college has strengthened its research base through sponsorship of a growing number of PhD studentships. ===21st century=== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig continues its expansion in the twenty- first century. Ionad Chaluim Chille √åle, the college's associate campus in Islay, opened in 2002. The college was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales and his wife in 2004; he expressed hope for the Gaelic language flourishing, stating \\"Scottish life is greatly enriched by the Gaelic dimension,\\" and \\"If it flourishes here it sends out a message of inspiration and optimism.\\" In 2008 the ¬£8 million new centre for creative and cultural industries, Ionad F√†s, incorporating a television studio, offices, workshop and exhibition spaces, and Gaelic-medium childcare facilities, was finished. In 2013 the ¬£6.7 million first phase of the ambitious Kilbeg Village scheme began, a long-term development that will result in new administration and research facilities, a conference and training centre, new college and community sports and recreation provision, a hotel, and up to 75 new houses being built in the space between the two campuses. ==Campus== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig: √Ärainn Chaluim Chille At present Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig occupies two linked campuses, √Ärainn Ostaig and √Ärainn Chaluim Chille. √Ärainn Ostaig, situated some north-east of the main ferry terminal at Armadale, consists of two quadrangles. The renovated Ostaig steading was originally built on a U-plan in the late 1820s by Major Allan MacDonald of Belfinlay, who had the lease of Ostaig farm at the time, then subsequently extended on the south side. The adjoining modern blocks of student accommodation, lecture facilities, and offices, designed by Donald Mackillop Assocs, were opened in autumn 1993. The original buildings contain the student common room and the T√†lla M√≤r or Great Hall, used for c√®ilidhs and smaller concerts, while the newer hosts the popular Caf√© Ostaig. √Ärainn Chaluim Chille, situated 300 yards to the east of √Ärainn Ostaig, consists of a main building (1998) incorporating teaching facilities, the college library and dining room, the lecture/sports/concert hall Talla Dhonaidh Chaimbeul, and student accommodation, and the broch-like tower L√≤chran an D√≤mhnallaich (1999), containing additional student and guest bedrooms and crowned by a glazed drum and lantern viewing platform. Designed by George Mulvagh of Gillespie Architects, the buildings were awarded a ‚ÄòRegeneration of Scotland‚Äô architectural award by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland. Adjoining them is the later Ionad F√†s (2008), the centre for creative and cultural industries, again designed by Gillespie Architects. The college's associate campus Ionad Chaluim Chille √åle, situated beside Bowmore on the island of Islay and incorporating a library and lecture facilities, was opened in 2002. ==Organisation== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig is an independent charitable trust and an Academic Partner of the University of the Highlands and Islands. The college itself is governed by a Board of Directors responsible for strategy and policy development, whose chairman since 2007 has been Roddy John MacLeod, now Lord Minginish. A college management team supervises the three internal departments of Academic Provision, Arts and Development, and Finance and Planning. College staff are also involved in the governance of the University of the Highlands and Islands, and participate in relevant committees within the wider network partnership. The following projects are associated with Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig: * C√†nan: bilingual creative agency * Faclair na G√†idhlig/Dictionary of Scottish Gaelic * Ainmean-√Äite na h-Alba/Gaelic Place-Names of Scotland * Soillse: the national research network for the maintenance and revitalisation of Gaelic language and culture * St√≤rdata N√†iseanta na G√†idhlig/Gaelic Terminology Database * Tobar an Dualchais/Kist o Riches: collaborative online folklore project Through its Residency Programme Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig also plays host to a writer-in- residence, a musician-in-residence, artists in residence, and a drama artist- in-residence. ==Academic lifeCourses=== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig offers the following degrees and diplomas: Distance Learning: * C√πrsa Inntrigidh (Beginners‚Äô Gaelic Course) * C√πrsa Adhartais (Advanced Gaelic Course) * Sgilean Sgr√¨obhaidh (Gaelic Writing Skills) * Deasachadh agus Foillseachadh (Editing and Publishing) * DipHE Gaelic and Related Studies * BA (With or without Honours) 'G√†idhlig is Leasachadh (Gaelic and Development) * BA (With or without Honours) C√†nan is Cultar na G√†idhlig (Gaelic Language and Culture) * CPD Diploma Leasachadh Coimhearsnachd (Community Development) * CPD Diploma Leasachadh C√†nain (Language Development) * PGCert Scottish Culture and Heritage * MA Learning and Teaching (Gaelic Arts) Undergraduate: * CertHE An C√πrsa Comais (Gaelic Competence Course) * CertHE G√†idhlig is Conaltradh (Gaelic and Communication) * PDA Diploma Na Meadhanan G√†idhlig (Gaelic Media) * BA (Hons) C√†nan is Cultar na G√†idhlig (Gaelic Language and Culture) * BA (Hons) G√†idhlig is Leasachadh (Gaelic and Development) * BA (Hons) G√†idhlig agus na Meadhanan (Gaelic and Media Studies) * BA (Hons) G√†idhlig agus Ce√≤l Traidiseanta (Gaelic and Traditional Music) * MA (Hons) G√†idhlig agus Foghlam (Gaelic and Education) Postgraduate: * MSc Cultar D√πthchasach agus Eachdraidh na G√†idhealtachd (Material Culture and G√†idhealtachd History) In addition, research staff at the college are presently supervising PhD theses concerning Gaelic language, culture, history, and sociolinguistics. Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig also offers a growing number of short courses, well-established programmes in Gaelic language and music as well as more recent ones in history, culture, and crofting. Most are based at the main Skye campus, but the college runs a number of courses elsewhere in the country and abroad. ===Library=== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig Library is an internationally significant collection of material, antiquarian and contemporary, relating to Gaelic language, culture, and music, and Highland history. At present Special Collections number over 6,000 volumes, comprising six principal divisions: * the Celtica Collection, acquired by Sir Robert Gordon of Letterfourie (1824‚Äì1908) and previously housed in Fort Augustus Abbey; * the MacCormick Collection, donated by the pre-eminent Gaelic bookseller and collector Donald MacCormick; * the collection of Sorley Maclean (1911‚Äì96), Gaelic poet and scholar; * the collection of Professor Robert A. Rankin (1915‚Äì2001), Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Glasgow, and Gaelic scholar; * the collection of Professor Roderick Cannon (1938‚Äì2015), Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at the University of East Anglia, and distinguished historian of bagpipe music; * the Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig Collection itself, accumulated since the college's foundation. The Library also holds a sizeable collection of historic 78-rpm recordings of Gaelic singers and musicians, donated from the archives of the BBC in Glasgow. Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig Library is a member of the Consortium of European Research Libraries, and the Ligue des Biblioth√®ques Europ√©enes de Recherche. ===College Principals and Directors=== The following have been College Principals and Directors of Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig: * Gordon Barr (Principal 1973‚Äì4) * Farquhar MacLennan (Principal 1975‚Äì8) * Iain Taylor (Principal 1980‚Äì2) * Se√°n √ì Drisceoil (Principal 1983‚Äì6) * Colin MacLeod (Principal 1986‚Äì7) * Norman Gillies (Director 1987‚Äì2009) * Boyd Robertson (Director 2009‚Äì18) * Gillian Munro (Director 2018‚Äì ) ==Student life and culture== Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig has a lively student culture. The college hosts regular concerts, plays, c√®ilidhs, dances, films, and gigs open to the wider local community, while local hotels and pubs offer weekly music sessions in a variety of styles. There are a number of local sports clubs, and a popular Club Coiseachd/Walking Club allows students the opportunity to enjoy the landscape of Skye and surrounding areas. As well as organising social events, the student association Comann nan Oileanach is actively involved in a number of campaigns, strengthening links with students in other Associate Partners in the University of the Highlands and Islands, with Celtic Societies in other universities and with other smaller colleges across the country. ==See also== * List of further and higher education colleges in Scotland * The Royal Cape Breton Gaelic College * S√†r Ghaidheal Fellowships ==ReferencesExternal links== * English version of website * G√†idhlig (Scottish Gaelic) version of website * Category:Category B listed buildings in Highland (council area) Category:Buildings and structures in the Isle of Skye Category:Higher education colleges in Scotland Category:University of the Highlands and Islands Category:Educational institutions established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig"},{"id":"2208859","text":"Pentazole is an aromatic chemical molecule consisting of a five-membered ring with all nitrogen atoms, one of which is bonded to a hydrogen atom. It has a molecular formula HN5. Although strictly speaking a homocyclic, inorganic compound, pentazole has historically been classed as the last in a series of heterocyclic azole compounds containing one to five nitrogen atoms. This set contains pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, triazoles, tetrazole, and pentazole. ==Derivatives== Substituted analogs of pentazole are collectively known as pentazoles. As a class, they are unstable and often highly explosive compounds. The first pentazole synthesized was phenylpentazole, where the pentazole ring is highly stabilized by conjugation with the phenyl ring. The derivative 4-dimethylaminophenylpentazole is among the most stable pentazole compounds known, although it still decomposes at temperatures over 50 ¬∞C. It is known that electron-donating groups stabilize aryl pentazole compounds. == Ions == The cyclic pentazolium cation () is not known due to its probable antiaromatic character; whereas the open-chained pentazenium cation () is known. Butler et al. first demonstrated the presence of the cyclic in solution through the decomposition of substituted aryl pentazoles at low temperature. The presence of and (held in solution through the interaction with zinc ions) was proven primarily using 15N NMR techniques of the decomposition products. These results were initially challenged by some authors, but subsequent experiments involving the detailed analysis of the decomposition products, complemented by computational studies, bore out the initial conclusion. The pentazolide anion is not expected to last longer than a few seconds in aqueous solution without the aid of complexing agents. The discovery of pentazoles spurred attempts to create all-nitrogen salts such as , which should be highly potent propellants for space travel. In 2002 the pentazolate anion was first detected with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry Vij, A., Pavlovich, J. G., Wilson, W. W., Vij, V. and Christe, K. O. (2002), Experimental Detection of the Pentaazacyclopentadienide (Pentazolate) Anion, cyclo-N5‚àí. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 41: 3051‚Äì3054. In 2016 the ion was also detected in solution.B. Bazanov, U. Geiger, R. Carmieli, D. Grinstein, S. Welner, Y. Haas,Detection of Cyclo-N5‚àí in THF Solution Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2016, 55, 13233. In 2017, white cubic crystals of the pentazolate salt, (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl were announced. In this salt, the rings are planar. The bond lengths in the ring are 1.309 √Ö, 1.310 √Ö, 1.310 √Ö, 1.324 √Ö, and 1.324 √Ö. When heated, the salt is stable up to 117 ¬∞C, and over this temperature it decomposes to ammonium azide. Under extreme pressure conditions, the pentazolate ion was also synthesized. It was first obtained in 2016 in the form of the CsN5 salt by compressing and laser-heating a mixture of CsN3 embedded in molecular N2 at 60 GPa. Following the pressure release, it was found metastable down to 18 GPa. In 2018, another team reported the high pressure synthesis of LiN5 above 45 GPa from a pure lithium surrounded by molecular nitrogen. This compound could be retained down to ambient conditions after the complete release of pressure. == References == Category:Nitrogen hydrides Category:Explosive chemicals Category:Simple aromatic rings ","title":"Pentazole"},{"id":"2208860","text":"Prague Zoological Garden (Czech: Zoologick√° zahrada hl. m. Prahy) is a zoo in Prague, Czech Republic. It was opened in 1931 with the goal to \\"advance the study of zoology, protect wildlife, and educate the public\\" in the district of Troja in the north of Prague. In 2013, the zoo occupied with in use for exhibits, and housed around 5,000 animals from just 676 species, including 132 species listed as threatened.The Zoo in Numbers The zoo is rated as the seventh best zoo in the world by Forbes Travel Guide in 2007, and is rated as the fifth best in the world by TripAdvisor. The zoo has contributed significantly to saving Przewalski's horse; for many years, it was the leading breeder of the subspecies. Director is Miroslav Bobek.https://www.zoopraha.cz/en/about-zoo/director ==History== The idea for a zoological garden in Prague was first proposed in 1881 in a newspaper article by Count Sweerts-Spork, on the occasion of the marriage of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and Princess St√©phanie of Belgium. Giraffe exposition In 1919, at a meeting of the advisory board for mathematics and natural sciences at the Ministry of Education and National Enlightenment, a committee was established to start the preparatory work on the establishment of the zoo. The zoo was opened to the public on 28 September 1931. In 1938, the first artificially bred Andean condor in the world was hatched and reared, and the first artificially bred polar bear, a female named Ilun, followed in 1942. In 1959 Dr. Zdenƒõk Veselovsk√Ω was appointed as director of the zoo. Under his leadership, the zoo achieved some world-class successes in the area of breeding and scientific research. In 1971 a new pavilion opened for large mammals, including elephants, hippos and rhinos, followed by a big cat pavilion in 1991. In 2001 the first artificial breeding of a Przewalski's Horse in the world took place at the zoo. Komodo dragon with keeper Jan Jano≈°ek in Prague Zoo. Prague Zoo is leading breeder of Komodo dragons in captivity. In 2002 Prague suffered the worst floods in its history. A large part of the zoo was flooded and 134 animals died. Well known is the story of Gaston, a sea lion, which the Vltava and Elbe rivers took to Germany, where Gaston died of total exhaustion. However, thanks to a big wave of solidarity and donations, Prague Zoo greatly flourished in the next decade. In 2004 the country's largest and most expensive animal pavilion, named the \\"Indonesian Jungle\\", was opened, and the first Western gorilla was born in Czech Republic, named Moja. This was followed in 2007 by the first breeding of a Komodo dragon in Prague Zoo.Komodo Dragons Thrive in Prague Zoo In 2009 a new exhibition for brown fur seals was opened, with an enlarged swimming pool and a grandstand. The following year saw a Texas tortoise bred in Europe for the first time. In 2011 Moja, a western gorilla famous from the multimedia project The Revealed, was moved to Cabarceno Natural Park in Spain. Four Przewalski's horses were transported to Mongolia to be released into the wild as part of Return of the Wild Horses reintroduction and in situ conservation project. In 2012 the zoo saw its highest number of babies born, numbering 1,557 from 211 species, including the world's first breeding of the crowned river turtle and the rufous-cheeked laughingthrush, as well as Prague Zoo's first breeding of the red panda. In 2013 a large new Elephant Valley pavilion was introduced and the first elephant was born in Prague Zoo, named Sita. The zoo was flooded in June the same year for a second time, but most animals were evacuated in time. In 2014, a pavilion was opened for 33 critically endangered Chinese giant salamanders, including three adults. The collection features the largest of such salamanders in Europe.Novinky.cz - Zoo Praha uk√°≈æe nejvƒõt≈°√≠ho velemloka v Evropƒõ After 13 years of waiting, the zoo is among the three unique zoos in the world, which have a breeding pair of Lesser Antillean iguana. ==Gallery== File:Seal's exposition 2, Prague zoo.jpgFur seal's exposition File:Africa closely, Zoo Prague.jpgAfrica closely File:Ursus maritimus, ZOO Praha 668.jpgPolar bear File:Panthera tigris Prague Zoo.jpgSumatran tiger File:Jielbeaumadier gorille des plaines de louest 1 zoo praha 2010.jpegWestern lowland gorilla File:Prague 07-2016 Zoo img12 Acinonyx jubatus.jpgCheetah File:Addax nasomaculatus in Prague Zoo (1).jpgAddax File:Hippopotamus amphibius in Prague Zoo (1).jpgHippopotamus File:Equus przewalskii in Prague Zoo (1).jpgPrzewalski's horse File:Casuarius casuarius in Prague Zoo.jpgCasuarius File:Phoenicopterus chilensis in Prague Zoo (2).jpgChilean flamingo File:Tragelaphus spekii in Prague Zoo (1).jpgSitatunga File:Necrosyrtes monachus -

Its four cumulative double bonds make it a cumulene. It is one of the stable members of the series of linear oxocarbons O=Cn=O, which also includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and pentacarbon dioxide (). Although if carefully purified it can exist at room temperature in the dark without decomposing, it will polymerize under certain conditions. The substance was discovered in 1873 by Benjamin Brodie by subjecting carbon monoxide to an electric current. He claimed that the product was part of a series of \\"oxycarbons\\" with formulas Cx+1Ox, namely C2O, , C4O3, , ..., and to have identified the last two; however, only is known. In 1891 Marcellin Berthelot observed that heating pure carbon monoxide at about 550 ¬∞C created small amounts of carbon dioxide but no trace of carbon, and assumed that a carbon- rich oxide was created instead, which he named \\"sub-oxide\\". He assumed it was the same product obtained by electric discharge and proposed the formula . Otto Diels later stated that the more organic names dicarbonylmethane and dioxallene were also correct. It is commonly described as an oily liquid or gas at room temperature with an extremely noxious odor. ==Synthesis== It is synthesized by warming a dry mixture of phosphorus pentoxide () and malonic acid or its esters. Therefore, it can be also considered as the anhydride of malonic anhydride, i.e. the \\"second anhydride\\" of malonic acid. Several other ways for synthesis and reactions of carbon suboxide can be found in a review from 1930 by Reyerson. ==Polymerization== Carbon suboxide polymerizes spontaneously to a red, yellow, or black solid. The structure is postulated to be poly(Œ±-pyronic), similar to the structure in 2-pyrone (Œ±-pyrone). The number of monomers in the polymers is variable (see Oxocarbon#Polymeric carbon oxides). In 1969, it was hypothesized that the color of the Martian surface was caused by this compound; this was disproved by the Viking Mars probes (the red color is instead due to iron oxide). ==Uses== Carbon suboxide is used in the preparation of malonates; and as an auxiliary to improve the dye affinity of furs. == Biological role == Those are 6- or 8-ring macrocyclic polymers of carbon suboxide that were found in living organisms. They are acting as an endogenous digoxin-like Na+/K+-ATP-ase and Ca-dependent ATP-ase inhibitors, endogenous natriuretics, antioxidants and antihypertensives Carbon suboxide, C3O2, can be produced in small amounts in any biochemical process that normally produces carbon monoxide, CO, for example, during heme oxidation by heme oxygenase-1. It can also be formed from malonic acid. It has been shown that carbon suboxide in an organism can quickly polymerize into macrocyclic polycarbon structures with the common formula ()n (mostly and ), and that those macrocyclic compounds are potent inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATP-ase and Ca- dependent ATP-ase, and have digoxin-like physiological properties and natriuretic and antihypertensive actions. Those macrocyclic carbon suboxide polymer compounds are thought to be endogenous digoxin-like regulators of Na+/K+-ATP-ases and Ca-dependent ATP-ases, and endogenous natriuretics and antihypertensives. Other than that, some authors think also that those macrocyclic compounds of carbon suboxide can possibly diminish free radical formation and oxidative stress and play a role in endogenous anticancer protective mechanisms, for example in the retina. == Structure and bonding == The structure of carbon suboxide has been the subject of experiments and computations since the 1970s. The central issue is the question of whether the molecule is linear or bent (i.e., whether \\\\theta_{C2} = \\\\angle C1C2C3 \\\\ \\\\overset{?}{=}\\\\ 180\\\\\\\\!^\\\\circ). Studies general agree that the molecule is highly non-rigid, with a very shallow barrier to bending. According to one study, the molecular geometry is described by a double-well potential with a minimum at Œ∏C2 ~ 160¬∞, an inversion barrier of 20 cm‚àí1 (0.057 kcal/mol), and a total energy change of 80 cm‚àí1 (0.23 kcal/mol) for 140¬∞ ‚â§ Œ∏C2 ‚â§ 180¬∞. The small energetic barrier to bending is around the same order of magnitude as the vibrational zero-point energy. Therefore, the molecule is best described as quasilinear. While infrared and electron diffraction studies have indicated that has a bent structure in the gas phase, the compound was found to possess at least an average linear geometry in the solid phase by X-ray crystallography, although the large thermal ellipsoids of the oxygen atoms and C2 have been interpreted to be consistent with rapid bending (minimum Œ∏C2 ~ 170¬∞), even in the solid state. A heterocumulene resonance form of carbon suboxide based on minimization of formal charges does not readily explain the molecule's non-rigidity and deviation from linearity. To account for the quasilinear structure of carbon suboxide, Frenking has proposed that carbon suboxide be regarded as a \\"coordination complex\\" of carbon(0) bearing two carbonyl ligands and two lone pairs: OC:->\\\\overset{..}{\\\\underset{..}{C}}<-:CO. However, the contribution of dative bonding in and similar species has been criticized as chemically unreasonable by others. 567x567px ==ReferencesExternal links== *WebElements page on compound's properties Category:Oxocarbons Category:Gaseous signaling molecules Category:Heterocumulenes Category:Enones Category:Ketenes Category:Diketones ","title":"Carbon suboxide"},{"id":"2208895","text":"The Bay Bridge Series, or the Battle of the Bay, is a series of baseball games played between‚Äîand the rivalry of‚ÄîMajor League Baseball's Oakland Athletics of the American League and San Francisco Giants of the National League. The series takes its name from the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge which links the cities of Oakland and San Francisco. As of 2018, the winner of the annual series retains a trophy fashioned from a piece of the original bridge. Although competitive, the regional rivalry between the A's and Giants is considered a friendly one with mostly mutual companionship between the fans, as opposed to Cubs‚ÄìWhite Sox, or Mets‚ÄìYankees games where animosity runs high, though sections of each fanbase does harbor towards the entirety of the other. This, however, is limited as many people see the opposing team as no threat to their own; hats displaying both teams on the cap are sold from vendors at the games, and once in a while the teams both dress in uniforms from a historic era of their franchises. Many fans actively cheer for both teams when they are not playing against the other. A's fans cite the Giants blocking a potential move to San Jose as a point of contention. The series is also occasionally referred to as the \\"BART Series\\" for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system that links Oakland to San Francisco. However, the name \\"BART Series\\" has never been popular beyond a small selection of history books and national broadcasters and has fallen out of favor, likely because BART does not provide direct or easy access to Oracle Park in San Francisco. Bay Area locals almost exclusively refer to the rivalry as the \\"Bay Bridge Series\\" or the \\"Battle of the Bay.\\" Originally, the term described a series of exhibition games played between the two clubs after the conclusion of spring training, immediately prior to the start of the regular season. It was first used to refer to the 1989 World Series which the Athletics won and the first time both teams had met since they moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. Today, it also refers to games played between the teams during the regular season since the commencement of Interleague play in 1997. Through the 2020 season, the A's have won 69 games, and the Giants have won 61. ==History prior to Bay Area move== The Giants and Athletics met in the , and World Series as the New York Giants and Philadelphia Athletics. The Giants won, 4‚Äì1, in 1905, and the Athletics won in 1911 (4-1) and 1913 (4-2), respectively. Hall of Famers such as John McGraw, Roger Bresnahan, Christy Mathewson, Joe McGinnity and Rube Marquard took part on the Giants side while the Athletics had Connie Mack, Chief Bender, Eddie Plank, Rube Waddell, Frank Baker and Eddie Collins. Such World Series match-ups might have helped contribute to the modern New York- Philadelphia sports rivalry that still continues to this day. ==The Move to the Bay1989 World Series=== The San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics met for the first time in the 1989 World Series. This series was interrupted minutes before Game 3 on October 17, 1989, when an earthquake, measuring 7.1 on the Richter Scale, struck the San Francisco Bay Area. The resulting damage to both Candlestick Park and to a lesser extent the Oakland Coliseum, along with the emotional and economic damage to the area, delayed the resumption of the series for 10 days, the longest interval between games in World Series history. The earthquake caused the collapse of a portion of the Bay Bridge, the centerpiece of many promotions for the \\"Bay Bridge Series\\"; however, experts have suggested that the Series actually helped to save countless lives, as many would-be commuters from both sides of the Bay had left work early or stayed in the cities to watch the game - as a result, traffic on the roads below collapsed portions of the Bay Bridge and Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland (while this disaster killed 42 people, local officials initially assumed that the death toll would be well into the hundreds) was significantly lighter than it would normally be at rush hour. The Athletics swept the Giants to win their most recent World Series championship. ===Interleague play=== Both teams met for the first time in the regular season in June 1997. The Giants' Barry Zito started 0‚Äì4 against his former team, finally beating the Athletics on June 12, 2010 at AT&T; Park. ==Athletics relocation controversy== The A's have been considering relocating to San Jose, California, for 13 years but have reportedly met resistance from the Giants. San Jose is located in Santa Clara County, which is considered to be the Giants \\"territory\\". The Athletics claim that former owner Walter A. Haas, Jr. agreed for the Giants to take over the Santa Clara area when the Giants were considering moving to Florida and needed revenue. The Giants contend that the agreement was not based upon actually relocating the team to Santa Clara as the A's contended. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, who was fraternity brothers with A's managing partner Lew Wolff at the University of Wisconsin, stated that the A's would not be able to survive as a franchise if they remained at the Oakland Coliseum. The Giants claimed that the territorial rights were \\"explicitly reaffirmed by Major League Baseball on four separate occasions,\\" when former managing partner Peter Magowan bought the team in the early 1990s. The Giants stated \\"upon purchasing the team 20 years ago, our plan to revive the franchise relied heavily on targeting and solidifying our fan base in the largest and fastest growing county within our territory. Based on these Constitutionally-recognized territorial rights, the Giants invested hundreds of millions of dollars to save and stabilize the team for the Bay Area, built AT&T; Park privately and has operated the franchise so that it can compete at the highest levels.\\" ==Results== {  style=\\"text- align: center; font-size:95%\\" - !

It premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. The film was released straight to video and did not receive a theatrical release. ==Plot== The film centers around Meg (Mira Sorvino), a med student who, after a traumatic experience, moves to Staten Island to live with her grandmother while she gets back on her feet. Her grandmother's care giver, Mrs. Saladino, recommends Meg for a waitress job in a family-run Italian restaurant called 'Santalino's'. There, Meg meets Raychel (Mariah Carey) and Kate (Melora Walters) and becomes fast friends with the two. Not long after starting, Meg discovers exactly what kind of clientele she is serving, the Mob. Meg becomes an adored fixture and valued asset due to her medical training, offering medical advice to several of the mobsters. One night, she becomes the focus of anger from one of the mob men, who slaps her. This leads Frankie (Christian Maelen)https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535393/ and Mr. Santalino to kill the man. Frankie forcibly orders Meg to chop up the body. Now realizing what she has gotten into, she decides she needs to get out as fast as possible. She confides in Kate, and she discovers that Kate is actually an undercover police officer. Meg is then convinced by the police to help them in a sting operation. She is soon discovered and a shoot out ensues in the restaurant. She is believed to be dead. Raychel has moved on to a more subdued life. In the final scene, Kate returns on their birthday, July 11, and reveals that Meg is actually alive, and the girls celebrate the pact that they made the year before. ==Cast== *Mariah Carey as Raychel *Mira Sorvino as Meg Kennedy *Melora Walters as Kate *Arthur J.

The adults are attracted to light and feed on foliage. They can make a hissing sound when touched or otherwise disturbed, which can resemble the hissing of a bat. This sound is made by their wings pushing down, forcing the air out between their wings and back. They can be an agricultural pest affecting a wide range of crops because their larvae feed on plant roots and can weaken or kill the plants. ==Description== They are relatively large in size, some growing to sizes as large as 1.5 inches (3 cm) or more. As in other members of this genus, the males have large distinctive antennae consisting of several lamellate plates, which they close up when threatened. The antennae are used to detect pheromones emitted by the females. The wing covers (elytra) have four long white stripes and one short stripe each. The underside of the thorax is covered with brownish hairs. Ten-lined June beetle, Coquitlam, July 26 2017. ==Life cycle== Eggs: The eggs are oval, dull, and creamy.

Chronologically the sixth to open, it connects the major western districts of Dorogomilovo and Fili along with the Moscow-City with the city centre. At present it has 13 stations and is 14.9 kilometres long. ==History== The history of the Filyovskaya line is one of the most complicated in Moscow Metro, due to the eastern radius falling victim of changing policies. Originally the earliest stations are the oldest, dating to 1935 and 1937 when they opened as part of the First stage and operated as a branch from what later became the Sokolnicheskaya line. In 1938 the branch service was liquidated, and the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line was created by trains now terminating at Kurskaya. However, during the Second World War, the station Arbatskaya suffered damage when a German bomb pierced its ceiling, as all of the 1930s stations were built subsurface. The threat of the Cold War becoming real meant that these early stations were not suited to double as bomb shelters, and instead, a deep parallel section was built. This would have meant the end of the Filyovskaya line, had Nikita Khrushchev as part of his visit to New York City not been inspired by seeing elevated and surface lines. Upon his return, and coinciding with his pursuit to save costs on architecture and construction, he forced to abandon the planned deep-level extension to Fili and instead build a surface line that would see the old stations re- opened. In 1958 the Arbatsko‚ÄìFilyovskaya line was inaugurated, becoming the sixth to open (the term Arbatsko- was dropped later). The line continued to extend westwards reaching Fili in 1959, along with its separate depot, the Fili Park in 1961 and ultimately the housing massif of Kuntsevo in 1965. A further extension was built to a newer massif in Krylatskoye in 1989. All of the stations, save Molodyozhnaya and Krylatskoye, were built surface, the original late 1950s trio was built to an identical side-platform configuration, while the remaining four to a more standards island platform. Despite the success in saving costs, the Russian climate, particularly the winter, the sharp bends, and the small station size made the line one of the most unpopular with passengers. By the 21st century, however, Filyovskaya line's fate would change radically. First the rising Moscow City business centre required a metro line, and a two-station branch was opened from Kievskaya in 2005 to Delovoy Tsentr and again in 2006 to Mezhdunarodnaya. In early 2008, with the realization of the Strogino‚ÄìMitino extension the Filyovskaya line's underground end was taken up by the same Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line, and its terminus was a redesigned platform at . ===Timeline=== {  style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; text- align: left;\\" - !Segment!!Date opened!!Length - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  1.7 km - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  1.4 km - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  * - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  2.3 km - style=\\"text- align: left;\\" ‚Äì  1.7 km - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  3.5 km - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  3.8 km**** - style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  N/A - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì  1.9 km - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì Delovoi Tsentr  2.2 km** - style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Delovoi Tsentr ‚Äì  0.5 km - style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äì Krylatskoye detached   ‚àí4.3 km*** - style=\\"text-align: left;\\"Total: 13 stations 14.7 km } * Service branch of 0.9 km was used to connect Aleksandrovsky Sad and Ploshchad Revolyutsii. ** Segment exists as branch on route Aleksandrovskiy Sad ‚Äì Kiyevskaya ‚Äì Mezhdunarodnaya. *** On 2 January 2008 the Filyovskaya line was shortened to its terminus at Kuntsevskaya, whilst the stations Molodyozhnaya and Krylatskoye were passed on to the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line ==Name changes== {  style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left;\\" - !Station!!Previous name(s)!!

A number of routes to H2Se have been reported, which are suitable for both large and small scale preparations. In the laboratory, H2Se is usually prepared by the action of water on Al2Se3, concomitant with formation of hydrated alumina. A related reaction involves the acid hydrolysis of FeSe.F√©her, F.

The threshold limit value is 0.05 ppm. The gas acts as an irritant at concentrations higher than 0.3 ppm, which is the main warning sign of exposure; below 1 ppm, this is \\"insufficient to prevent exposure\\", while at 1.5 ppm the irritation is \\"intolerable\\". Exposure at high concentrations, even for less than a minute, causes the gas to attack the eyes and mucous membranes; this causes cold-like symptoms for at least a few days afterwards. In Germany, the limit in drinking water is 0.008 mg/L, and the US EPA recommends a maximum contamination of 0.01 mg/L.Bernd E.

It is suspected that this is due to the gas' tendency to oxidise to form red selenium in mucous membranes; elemental selenium is less toxic than selenides are. ==See also== *Hydrogen diselenide ==ReferencesExternal links== * WebElements page on compound's properties * CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards Category:Hydrogen compounds Category:Selenides ","title":"Hydrogen selenide"},{"id":"2208945","text":"Sindhi may refer to: *something from, or related to Sindh, a province of Pakistan * Sindhi people, an ethnic group from the Sindh region * Sindhi language, the Indo-Aryan language spoken by them == People with the name == * Sarkash Sindhi (1940‚Äì2012), poet of Sindhi language * Ubaidullah Sindhi (1872‚Äì1944), political activist * Ahmad Bakhsh Sindhi (1917‚Äì2000), a leader of the Indian National Congress * Abu Raja Sindhi, Arabic scholar * Abu Mashar Sindhi, scholar of Hadith literature ==See also== * * Sindi (disambiguation) * Sindi people, an ancient Scythian people * Sinti, a Romani people of Central Europe * Red Sindhi, a breed of cattle Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Sindhi"},{"id":"2208947","text":"Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman (or conduct unbecoming for short) is an offense that is subject to court martial in the armed forces of some nations. ==Use in the United Kingdom== The phrase was used as a charge in courts martial of the British Armed Forces in the 18th and early 19th centuries, although it was not defined as a specific offence in the Articles of War.

In 1673 he was with Monmouth at Maastricht during the Franco-Dutch War and was present during two campaigns with Turenne on the Rhine. In 1680 he was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel, and soon afterwards Colonel of the 2nd Tangier Regiment (afterwards the King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment). In 1682 he became Governor of Tangier and colonel of the Tangier Regiment (afterwards the Queens Royal West Surrey Regiment). In the view of the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, he was \\"a military adventurer whose vices had been developed by the worst of all schools, Tangier.... Within the ramparts of his fortress he was a despotic prince. The only check on his tyranny was the fear of being called to account by a distant and a careless government. He might therefore safely proceed to the most audacious excesses of rapacity, licentiousness, and cruelty. He lived with boundless dissoluteness, and procured by extortion the means of indulgence.\\" Kirke commanded his regiment at the Battle of Sedgemoor in July 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion and then ruthlessly hunted down the fugitives after the battle. Brigadier Kirke took a notable part in the Glorious Revolution three years later, and William III promoted him.

He notably served as Lord Steward of the Household from 1989 to 2001. ==Background, education and military service== Ridley was the son of Matthew White Ridley, 3rd Viscount Ridley, and Ursula Lutyens, daughter of Sir Edwin Lutyens. His younger brother Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale, was a prominent Conservative Party politician who served as a government minister for nearly all of Margaret Thatcher's years as Prime Minister. Matthew Ridley was educated at Eton College and spent several months studying agriculture at King‚Äôs College, University of Durham (now Newcastle University). The Second World War interrupted his education and he joined the Coldstream Guards, serving in Normandy and Germany in 1944-45. He then studied at Oxford, graduating with a degree in Agriculture from Balliol College in 1948. He then served as an aide-de-camp to Sir Evelyn Baring, then Governor of Kenya. During this time he furthered his interest in nature and science. In 1955, Ridley and zoologist Lord Richard Percy spent four months on an uninhabited island in the Seychelles studying the plight of the dwindling sooty tern. Later he joined the Territorial Army, reaching the rank of Brevet Colonel in the Northumberland Hussars: he became Honorary Colonel of that unit in 1979. ==Public life== Ridley succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1964. He was Chairman of Northumberland County Council from 1967 to 1979. He chaired several companies and societies, before serving as Chancellor of the University of Newcastle from 1988 to 1999, as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland from 1984 to 2000, and as Lord Steward of the Household from 1989 to 2001. He was succeeded by the Duke of Abercorn as Lord Steward in 2001. He was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1992 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1994.

In astronomy, the most common use of such an astronomical interferometer is to determine the apparent angular diameter of a radio source or star. If the distance to the object can then be determined by parallax or some other method, the physical diameter of the star can then be inferred. An example of an optical intensity interferometer is the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. In quantum optics, some devices which take advantage of correlation and anti-correlation effects in beams of photons might be said to be intensity interferometers, although the term is usually reserved for observatories. An intensity interferometer is built from two light detectors, typically either radio antenna or optical telescopes with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), separated by some distance, called the baseline. Both detectors are pointed at the same astronomical source, and intensity measurements are then transmitted to a central correlator facility. A major advantage of intensity interferometers is that only the measured intensity observed by each detector must be sent to the central correlator facility, rather than the amplitude and phase of the signal. The intensity interferometer measures interferometric visibilities like all other astronomical interferometers. These measurements can be used to calculate the diameter and limb darkening coefficients of stars, but with intensity interferometers aperture synthesis images cannot be produced as the visibility phase information is not preserved by an intensity interferometer. ==References== Category:Telescopes Category:Interferometric telescopes Category:Quantum optics ","title":"Intensity interferometer"},{"id":"2208981","text":"The Freeway Series is a Major League Baseball (MLB) interleague rivalry played between the Los Angeles Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Angels are members of the American League (AL) West division, and the Dodgers are members of the National League (NL) West division. The series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by driving along Interstate 5. The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams. The term \\"Freeway Series\\" also inspired the official name of the region's NHL rivalry between the Los Angeles Kings and the Anaheim Ducks: the Freeway Face-Off. ==Background== The rise of Southern California as a major region of the United States brought about a significant economic rivalry between neighboring Los Angeles and Orange counties. To many living outside of Southern California, the entire region is often simply referred to as \\"LA\\", associating Los Angeles and Orange counties with the same stereotypes and preconceptions. However, the two counties differ sharply in political ideology, socioeconomic status, and demographics. Los Angeles County is more liberal, and is represented by a more ethnically diverse population, while Orange County was known to be one of the most conservative areas in the state. This divide led to the Los Angeles/Orange county line being colloquially referred to as the Orange Curtain. This can be somewhat misleading, though, because the older, more urban, cities of northern and central Orange County (Anaheim, Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Buena Park, etc.) are much more in tune with Los Angeles County cities than their southern Orange County counterparts. These older Orange County cities are much less homogeneous than the south, and the income levels and demographics represent this. In recent years though, coinciding with the postseason success of the Dodgers and the growing postseason drought for the Angels, gameday experiences for each team have drastically changed (with a Dodgers game costing much more money to attend versus than of an Angels game)https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-angels-ticket- costs-20190321-story.html because of this the economic situations of each fanbase have experienced a sort of role reversal. Another contributing factor of the changing fanbases of both franchises is the ownership of the Angels by that of Arte Moreno (the first Mexican-American to own a major sports team in the United States) which has led to a significant growth of its Hispanic and Latino American fanbase.https://www.ocregister.com/2012/04/06/for-latino-fans- the-angels-mean-familia/ This has even become a contributing factor toward players such as Anthony Rendon choosing to sign with the Angels over that of the Dodgers.https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28298626/anthony-rendon-not- choosing-dodgers-la-hollywood-lifestyle-not-fit ==History== The first exhibition game between the two clubs (won by the Angels) was played in 1962 in Palm Springs, at the time the spring training home of the Angels. The first pre-season series was played at Dodger Stadium, at the time the home ballpark of both teams April 6‚Äì7, 1963. The Angels won both of the two games played. After the Angels added Los Angeles to their official name in 2005, the rivalry took on renewed interest, as the series took on a more intracity atmosphere. Throughout the 2005 season, Dodger Stadium listed the Angels as \\"ANA\\" on its out-of-town scoreboard and team schedules, as it was prior to Angels' name change. However, the Dodgers now post \\"LAA\\" on both their scoreboard and schedules. Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully refers to the team as just the Angels when mentioning them on the air. Dodgers tickets still refer to the Angels as the \\"Anaheim Angels.\\" As of the 2011 season, however, the Angels' out-of-town scoreboard in right field still lists the Dodgers by their pre-2005 \\"LA\\" abbreviation instead of \\"LAD\\". The Angels' name change was largely opposed by the Dodgers organization, city and county of Los Angeles, Anaheim, every other city in Orange County, and fans on both sides. The prevailing argument was that the Angels did not play within Los Angeles county limits, and that adding LA to the name inaccurately represented the location and background of the team's fans. The Angels' ownership countered that bringing the Los Angeles name to the American League was beneficial to the entire region and organization. Furthermore, the Census Bureau's definition of Greater Los Angeles includes Orange County in its definition, and the Angels have always used Los Angeles stations to broadcast their TV and radio games. The adding of the \\"Los Angeles\\" to the Angels name still causes some resentment in the minds of both Angel and Dodger fans today. Regular- and post-season games between the two teams take place at either Angel Stadium of Anaheim or Dodger Stadium. The two stadiums are located approximately apart, and take approximately 40-50 minutes to travel via Metrolink or Amtrak from their closest stations, Los Angeles Union Station and the Anaheim Station. At one point, both teams were owned by major media conglomerates: the Angels had been owned by the Walt Disney Company, and the Dodgers were owned by News Corporation (each company owned one of the MLB broadcast partners, with News Corporation changing its name to 21st Century Fox in 2013, and subsequently being purchased by the Walt Disney Company in 2019). Both teams have been sold in recent years. During the 2002 World Series, there was a moment of peace in the rivalry as a result of the nightmares the Dodgers and their fans were facing because the Angels played the San Francisco Giants, the fierce in-state rivals of the Dodgers. The Los Angeles Times called the series \\"the Dodgers' 'Nightmare Series.'\\" The New York Post called it \\"the worst-scenario World Series for the Dodgers.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle called the series \\"a Dodger fan's worst nightmare.\\" The Dodgers and their fans, including Chairman Bob Daly and former manager Tommy Lasorda, rooted for the eventual champions and attended their games in Anaheim. Lasorda was at Game 2 and stood behind the batting cage and said that he's a big fan of Angels manager Mike Scioscia. Daly attended Game 7 and sat near the Angels dugout, as a fan of late Angels owner Gene Autry. This series was the Angels first championship, while the Dodgers' last title came in the 1988 World Series and appearance was 2018. History was made in when two MVPs were chosen from the same metropolitan area with the Angels outfielder Mike Trout winning the American League MVP and Dodger pitcher Clayton Kershaw winning National League MVP for the year. This occurred again in when the Angels' Trout and Dodgers' Cody Bellinger won their league's respective MVP awards. ==Results== {  style=font-size:95%\\" - !

Along with letterer Artie Simek, Rosen lettered and helped design logos for virtually all Marvel Comics published during the 1960s. Rosen also moonlighted for other companies during this time: he was the (uncredited) letterer for the 1965-66 Archie Comics series The Mighty Crusaders. ==Biography== Sam Rosen began his career as a comic book letterer in New York City in 1940, working on writer-artist Will Eisner's The Spirit, the seven- page lead feature in a comic-book style Sunday supplement syndicated to newspapers.Grand Comics Database: Police Comics #13 (Nov. 1942), which reprinted the June 30, 1940 Spirit story. During this period, he also worked for Fox Comics and Benjamin W. Sangor studio, a comic book packager.

After having studied law for a short while at Halle, he entered the regiment of the crown prince of Prussia in Potsdam and was attached to it as officer for ten years. Disappointed in his military career, owing to the slowness of promotion, he retired in 1774, and accepting the post of tutor to Prince Frederick Ferdinand Constantin of Saxe-Weimar, accompanied him and his elder brother, the hereditary prince, on a tour to Paris. On this journey he visited Goethe in Frankfurt-on-Main, and introduced him to the hereditary prince, Charles Augustus. This meeting is memorable as being the immediate cause of Goethe's later intimate connection with the Weimar court. After Knebel's return and the premature death of his pupil he was pensioned, receiving the rank of major. In 1798 he married the singer Luise von Rudorf, and retired to Ilmenau; but in 1805 he moved to Jena, where he lived until his death in 1834. ==Works== Knebel's Sammlung kleiner Gedichte (1815), issued anonymously, and Distichen (1827) contain many graceful sonnets, but it is as a translator that he is best known. His translation of the elegies of Propertius, Elegien von Properz (1798), and that of Lucretius, De Rerum Natura (2 vols., 1821) are deservedly praised. Also notable is his translation of Vittorio Alfieri's tragedy Saul. Since their first acquaintance, Knebel and Goethe were intimate friends, and not the least interesting of Knebel's writings is his correspondence with the eminent poet, Briefwechsel mit Goethe (ed. G. E. Guhrauer, 2 vols., 1851). Varnhagen von Ense and Theodor Mundt edited his Literarischer Nachlass und Briefwechsel (‚ÄúLiterary remains and correspondence,‚Äù 3 vols., Leipsic, 1835), the latter furnishing a biographical notice. ==NotesReferences== * This work in turn cites: ** Hugo von Knebel-D√∂beritz, Karl Ludwig von Knebel. 1890. * * Category:1744 births Category:1834 deaths Category:People from Donau-Ries Category:German poets Category:Prussian Army personnel Category:German male poets ","title":"Karl Ludwig von Knebel"},{"id":"2209018","text":"Dries Buytaert at FOSDEM 2008.

He meets 19-year-old Betty (B√©atrice Dalle), a volatile and impulsive young woman, and the two begin a passionate affair, living in his borrowed shack on the beach. After a row with him where she tears apart and smashes up the house, she finds the manuscript of his first novel, reads it in one long sitting and decides he is a genius. However, after another argument with his boss, she empties the shack and burns it down. The two decamp to the outskirts of Paris, where her friend Lisa (Consuelo de Haviland) has a small hotel. Betty laboriously types out Zorg's novel and submits it to various publishers. They meet Lisa's new boyfriend Eddy (G√©rard Darmon), and the four have many fun times, often fuelled by alcohol. They find work in Eddy's pizzeria but a fight erupts in which Betty stabs a customer with a fork. Zorg tries to slap her back to her senses. Though Zorg hides the rejection letters Betty finds one and, going to the publisher's house, slashes his face. Zorg induces him to drop charges by threatening him with violence, saying she is the only good thing in his life and she is all he has. Eddy's mother dies and the friends go to the funeral in Marvejols. There, Eddy asks Zorg and Betty if they will live in the dead woman's house and look after her piano shop. Zorg enjoys the quiet provincial life and makes friends with the grocer Bob (Jacques Mathou), his sex-starved wife Annie (Cl√©mentine C√©lari√©) and various offbeat characters, but Betty's violent mood swings are a concern. One day, after an irritating comment from Zorg, she punches out a window with her bare hand and goes on a screaming flight through the town. Happiness seems on the horizon when a home test suggests Betty is pregnant, but a lab test is negative and she sinks into depression and tells him she is hearing voices talking to her in her head. Zorg, masquerading as a woman, robs an armoured cash collection van delivery headquarters, holding the guards at gunpoint and tying them up. He attempts to use the money to buy Betty's happiness, but she fails to respond and enacts yet another prosecutable offence by luring a small boy away from his mother and taking him to a toy store. Zorg finds her and they both flee from the authorities as they rush to rescue the boy. One day Zorg comes home to find blood all over the place and Betty gone. Bob tells him she has gouged out an eye and is in the hospital. Rushing there, Zorg finds her under heavy sedation and is told to come back the next day. Going home, he receives a phone call from a publisher accepting his manuscript. On his next visit to the hospital, he finds Betty restrained and catatonic. He becomes agitated and a doctor tells him she will need prolonged treatment and may never recover her sanity. Zorg reacts by blaming her illness on the medication being administered and physically attacks the doctor. He is forcefully ejected from the hospital after a violent struggle with three orderlies. Returning in disguise, he whispers his farewells and smothers Betty with a pillow. Going home, he sits down to continue his current book. ==Cast== * B√©atrice Dalle as Betty * Jean-Hugues Anglade as Zorg * G√©rard Darmon as Eddy * Consuelo de Haviland as Lisa * Jacques Mathou as Bob * Cl√©mentine C√©lari√© as Annie * Vincent Lindon as Richard, the young policeman * Louis Bellanti as Mario * Philippe Laudenbach as the editor * Claude Aufaure as the doctor * Dominique Besnehard as a customer in the pizzeria * Raoul Billerey as the old policeman * Jean-Pierre Bisson as the commissioner (in the complete version) * Dominique Pinon as the drug dealer (in the complete version) ==Release== Betty Blue was distributed in the United States in November 1986 with English subtitles. ==See also== * List of submissions to the 59th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film * Cin√©ma du look ==References* *Betty Blue: The Look of Love an essay by Chelsea Phillips-Carr at the Criterion Collection Category:1986 films Category:1986 romantic drama films Category:Films scored by Gabriel Yared Category:Films directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix Category:Films set in Marseille Category:French films Category:French- language films Category:French romantic drama films Category:Gaumont Film Company films Category:Murder in films Category:Self-harm in films Category:1980s erotic drama films Category:French erotic drama films Category:Erotic romance films Category:1986 drama films ","title":"Betty Blue"},{"id":"2209031","text":"Yamaha Drums is a subsidiary of the Yamaha Corporation founded in 1967. The company manufactures acoustic and electronic drum kits as well as percussion instruments, marching band equipment, and drum hardware. ==Production== Most of Yamaha's drums are manufactured at two different locations in Asia. Their factory in Osaka produces their high-end professional drums as well as all of their marching percussion. The research and development of new products also takes place there. Marketing is managed from the Yamaha Corp. headquarters in Hamamatsu. The factory in China produced the entry-level GigMaker kit and the intermediate-kit Stage Custom Birch. Their factory in Indonesia produces the Tour Custom and the newly introduced Rock Tour series drums. The Indonesian factory uses the same machinery and techniques in their drum shells and all of the craftsmen working there are trained by Japanese craftsmen from the Osaka site. The only difference between these two plants is that the Osaka plant uses the more exclusive woods (maple, birch and oak)\\"Absolute knowledge\\" on official website ==Acquisition of Premier== In 1987, Yamaha acquired the Premier Percussion factory in England in an attempt to establish the Yamaha name in the tougher European market. Yamaha placed machinery and trained the Premier craftsmen in the \\"Yamaha-way\\" of making drums, resulting in Premier producing a large number of Yamaha drums \\"made in England.\\" In 1992, Yamaha withdrew and sold their stock shares back to Premier. ==Current productsAcoustic drums=== Drums for the professional, intermediate and beginner Rock Tour Custom.

Handcrafted by our expert technicians, it is rooted in over 50 years of history, tradition, experience and technology in an all-out pursuit of the ultimate in drum craftsmanship and sound. *Recording Custom - All-birch. For the majority of their existence have been made from Japanese \\"Hokkaido\\" Birch, only more recently switching to North American Birch when production moved from Japan. 6-ply shells with 30-degree bearing edges are complemented by the redesigned, high-tension lug weighted to enhance lower frequencies. *Live Custom Hybrid Oak - Redefining the original sound of oak with a new hybrid shell, the new Live Custom Hybrid Oak enhances the dynamic range by accentuating its attack and projection and incorporates the traditional Japanese uzukuri handcrafted shell finishing, creating a unique look that defines the expression of oak. *Absolute Hybrid Maple - The Absolute Hybrid Maple was built from the sound up for expressive, innovative play and timeless quality that will last for generations. *Tour Custom - Introduced in the early 1980s, Tour Custom drums consisted of a mahogany/birch blend for a deeper fundamental tone. The line was re-introduced in 2006 as a semi-pro kit with 100% Maple shells and 60 degrees R2 bearing edges for a warm and round tone. They are finished in high-gloss lacquer, with three translucent and one solid finish. The current Tour Custom in maple was discontinued in 2011. *Stage Custom Birch - An intermediate-level kit made from 100% birch shells. The drums come in eight lacquer finishes and features standard YESS mounts. Succeeds the Stage Custom Advantage series. For 2011, a new bebop configuration was introduced to the line. In 2014 Yamaha introduced the redesigned Stage Custom Birch drum set at the 2014 NAMM Show with many upgraded features that make it even better. Yamaha Stage Custom Birch is perfect for the working professional to the beginner. *RYDEEN (5-piece shell pack) is exactly what any beginner or intermediate player would love to play.

PHX features the new Hook Lug and the improved YESS II mounting system. Artists that were invited to attend the final prototype testing of the PHX were told to bring their \\"best\\" Yamaha kit for a comparison. Carter Beauford (Dave Matthews Band) chose to forgo this new PHX series in favor of his old Recording Custom toms, perhaps due to thinner shells. He still uses a PHX bass drum however. *Recording Custom - Yamaha's longest-running series of drums for more than 40 years. Originally called the \\"9000 Series\\", more recently changed to the current name, \\"Recording Custom\\". Made from birch and features a large, high-mass lug that extends the length of the shell. The series features a small, rectangular badge with rounded corners. They were available in 6 colors: Cherry Wood, Hot Red, Cobalt Blue, Stage White, Solid Black and Quartz Gray. A limited edition version of the Recording Custom series was introduced in 2011 for their 45th anniversary, featuring through-shell tom mounts and 60-degree bearing edges. The kits will be available in three vintage colors: Piano White, Mellow Yellow, and Hot Red, with 15 set produced for each color. *Absolute Series - Drums made from either North American maple or Hokkaido birch or 100% beech (from Northern Japan). Starting in 2009, the Absolute Series also feature new YESS II mounts and optional Hook Lugs shared from the PHX line. Absolute drums are available in 24 finishes, including the new Luminous White Sparkle that glows in the dark. *Oak Custom - Drums crafted from 100% Japanese White Oak wood which is a very dense hardwood and equipped with YESS mounts. The low fundamental and projection of oak makes it a favorite with rock drummers and the wide tuning and dynamic range makes it a top choice for jazz drummers as well. They are less expensive than their Absolute series counterparts, but are much more costly than either the Tour Custom, Rock Tour, Stage Custom or GigMaker lines. Oak Customs complement the player with outstanding volume and clarity. The tone of the Oak is in between of Maple and Birch with the warmth and attack. Yamaha is the only mass-production drum company that offers a 100% Oak kit mainly thanks to the Air-Seal shell technology.

He was the MP for Belfast Falls in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and later the leader of the Republican Labour Party. In 1927, Diamond was the main initiator and first chairman of O'Donnell's GAA. He later became chairman of Antrim GAA. Diamond was an active nationalist before the Second World War and in 1933 was sentenced to a month in jail for refusing to pay a fine given out for addressing an illegal rally in support of republican prisoners. The following year, he stood in the Belfast Central by-election as an \\"Anti-Partition\\" candidate. In 1944, Diamond became a founder member of the Socialist Republican Party. He took the Belfast Falls seat at the 1945 Northern Ireland general election. In 1949, no one else contested the seat, and he remained the Socialist Republican Party's only MP, but the party disbanded that year. While most of its members joined the Irish Labour Party, Diamond held his seat, until 1964 as an independent standing as \\"Republican Labour\\". In 1964, Diamond joined with Gerry Fitt to found the Republican Labour Party. He stood for the Westminster constituency of Belfast West in the October 1964 general election, but was defeated by James Kilfedder. The campaign was disfigured by riots after Ian Paisley attempted to lead a Unionist crowd up Divis Street to remove an Irish tricolour from the offices of Sinn F√©in, who were supporting the candidacy of Billy McMillen. The riots galvanised the Unionist vote while the nationalist vote was split between Diamond and McMillen. Diamond alleged that the official Ulster Unionist Party had colluded in this. Diamond saw a strong challenge to his position from the resurgent Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) in the late 1960s, and was criticised for being inattentive to his constituents' needs. Paddy Devlin of the NILP, a former supporter of the reformists in the Belfast branch of the Irish Labour Party, defeated him in the 1969 Northern Ireland general election. In 1970, Fitt left the Republican Labour Party to found the broader-based Social Democratic and Labour Party. Paddy Kennedy assumed the leadership, but the party was in terminal decline and disbanded in 1973. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1945‚Äì1949 Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1949‚Äì1953 Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1953‚Äì1958 Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1958‚Äì1962 Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1962‚Äì1965 Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland 1965‚Äì1969 Category:Republican Labour Party members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland Category:Members of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for Belfast constituencies ","title":"Harry Diamond (politician)"},{"id":"2209059","text":"Audrey Gwendoline Long (April 14, 1922 ‚Äì September 19, 2014) was an American stage and screen actress of English descent, who performed mainly in low- budget films in the 1940s and early 1950s.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode Retiring Grand Nagus Zek announces Quark as his successor (over his own son); Sisko frets over his son's devotion to his friend Nog, a known troublemaker. ==Plot== Zek, the Grand Nagus of the Ferengi Alliance, arrives on the station and seems to take an interest in Quark, but it is not clear why. He tells Quark that he wants to use Quark's bar for a conference, where he announces that Quark will be his successor. The Nagus then dies, apparently making Quark's appointment permanent. Quark has a hard time adjusting to his new position, but he becomes popular among the Ferengi entrepreneurs by giving away lucrative business opportunities. Zek's son Krax and Rom attempt to kill Quark and are stopped by Zek, who appears before them still very much alive. Quark's appointment was a test to see how his son would respond in his absence, and as Zek says, \\"You failed! Miserably!\\" Quark congratulates Rom for having the lobes to try to kill him. Meanwhile, Sisko is trying to cope with the friendship between his son Jake and Rom's son Nog. His problem is seemingly solved when Rom orders Nog not to attend school; however, Jake and Nog begin spending even more time together. Jake will only tell Sisko that what they are doing is \\"private.\\" In the end, Sisko finds he has nothing to worry about when he finds Jake teaching Nog how to read. ==Arc significance== * First appearance of Grand Nagus Zek and first mention of his plans to expand Ferengi business into the Gamma Quadrant. ==Notes== * In this episode, there is an homage shot to The Godfather.

Quark is even reclining in a chair as did Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone and petting an alien creature the way the Don held his cat. In his following line as well he paraphrased Brando: \\"And now you call me [Nagus]...\\". ==Reception== In 2018, CBR ranked Grand Nagus Zek, the character introduced in this episode, as the 13th best recurring character of all Star Trek. ==References== * P.

Scottish writers associated with the movement met at her home in Corstorphine. == Early life and education == Helen Burness Cruickshank (Nell) was born in Hillside, Montrose, Angus, in one of the staff houses as her father George Cruickshank, was a hospital attendant at Sunnyside. Helen was the youngest of three to her father George (1845-1924) and mother Sarah Wood (1850-1940), a domestic servant whose father Colin Gibb Wood had been Master Plumber, of Montrose. Helen was educated at the Hillside village school from the age of four, before attending Montrose Academy at the age of ten with her two older brothers. Every year the family summer holiday was spent in cabins in Glenesk where George taught his children about nature, Helen developed a love of climbing and walking that stayed with her throughout her life where she spent many long trips in the Highlands. The annual family holiday were an inspiration within Cruickshank's poetry with references to the landscapes and people of Angus appearing in her poetry. Although Helen achieved awards in every subject at school, her father could not afford to send her to University as her Rector had advised, and Helen left school at the age of fifteen sitting exams for the Civil Service. Cruickshank's first job was at the Post Office Savings Bank in London from 1903 to 1912, during Helen's time in London she gained an interest in politics and women's suffrage. This interest was sparked due to her awareness of the unfair conditions and restricted wages that she saw working woman had to face in the workplace. Helen joined the Women's Social and Political Union and campaigned for the cause by joining marches and chalking the pavements. == Edinburgh == Plaque commemorating Helen Cruickshank, at Hillview Terrace, Corstorphine, Edinburgh In 1912, Helen was offered a position in Edinburgh for the health insurance part of the government body which she accepted. It was during her move to Edinburgh that she began to write poetry, it was also around this time that she first fell in love, the heartbreak of the affair spurred her to write. After World War I, Cruickshank began to gain some success in having her poetry published sometimes under pseudonyms in The Glasgow Herald. The magazines and newspapers which Helen was managing to have her work sometimes published in was a source of contemporary poetry, and she began to become familiar with the works of Alexander Gray, William Soutar and Marion Angus, with them also becoming familiar with her work. C. M. Grieve was looking for new contributions for a new anthology, Northern Numbers, which Helen submitted work to and from this their correspondences began a long-lasting friendship between the pair. Helen began to rent a studio flat in 1921 and liked being a part of the bohemian lifestyle, being so close to the book shops, and Pentland hills were a source of enjoyment for her. However, this freedom did not last as Helen's father died in 1924, as the only daughter it was assumed that Helen would take over the care of her mother which meant she had also had to give up her option to marry, as woman that worked in the civil service could not continue to work after they were married. Helen gave up her studio flat and bought a semi- detached house on Corstorphine Hill. == Dinnieduff == Helen and her mother moved in to the semi-detached house, Dinnieduff, which became an unofficial meeting place for those involved with Scottish literature at that time. In 1927, Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) became a regular guest at Dinnieduff, he would come to Edinburgh once a month to do business with the Scottish Centre of the PEN Club with Helen being a founding member and Honorary Secretary, Helen would eventually take Hugh's leading role in the PEN Club. Meetings of the PEN Club were often held in Dinnieduff, Helen often held an open house during the 1920s and 1930s where those involved in Scottish literature at that time would visit and stay, notable visitors include the novelist James Leslie Mitchell (Lewis Grassic Gibbon). Her last act for the PEN Club was to raise funds for the International PEN Congress which took place in Scotland in 1934. == Work == Cruickshank's first collection Up the Noran Water (1934) was published by Metheun, was mostly written in Scots with a few poems being written in English. Helen as a proud Scottish nationalist became a founding member of the Saltire Society in 1936. However, Helen's writing had to be put aside as her work-load became heavier due to World War II. Helen worked on a scheme to evacuate children abroad, and also volunteered for fire watching duties over night on top of her own job and caring for her mother. Helen's mother died in 1940. After the war, Helen took on the role of an executive officer for the Department of Health in Edinburgh, a role she held until her retirement, on medical grounds due to duodenal ulcers, in 1944. After her health had recovered sufficiently, Helen began to entertain once more at Dinnieduff. She was an enthusiastic follower of the Edinburgh International Film Festival since its beginnings in 1947. Helen's later works include Sea Buckthorn (1954), The Ponnage Pool (1968), Collected Poems (1971) and More Collected Poems (1978), she wrote poetry until the end of her life with her last unfinished poem being about a woman who cannot stop for death as she has too much to do. == Later life and celebration == The BBC commissioned a programme in celebration of her 80th birthday, in 1966, and in 1969 her friends commissioned a bust by Vincent Butler, which is on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. She was awarded an honorary MA by Edinburgh University in 1971. Helen lived in Dinnieduff for over fifty years, she lived alone after her mother's death in 1940, and even though her health deteriorated she did not leave her home until it was completely necessary to do so when she was eighty-eight. Helen left to Queensberry Lodge on the Canongate in November 1974 and died there on 2 March 1975. She had planned her own cremation, and this was carried out at Warriston in Edinburgh. Helen's friends laid a plaque at the front door in 1986. Cruickshank recorded her long life and aspects of her times in her autobiography, Octobiography (1987), which was published posthumously. Helen Cruickshank is commemorated in Makars' Court, outside The Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, selections for Makars' Court are made by the Writers' Museum; the Saltire Society; the Scottish Poetry Library. ==See also== *List of suffragists and suffragettes ==References External links == * Helen Cruickshank bio * Helen B.

Urani translates to uranium in Albanian, and the club was named this due to the city's association with the metal. The club changed its name to KS Skampa Elbasan briefly before 1930. They first participated in a nationally recognised competition in the first top flight football league in Albania, the 1930 Kategoria e Par√´, where the club finished in 5th place, second from bottom, with a record of 3 wins, 1 draw and 6 losses. The following season they again finished in penultimate place, this time in 7 team league format. In the 1932 champion, they finished bottom of the league, gaining no points after 8 straight losses, which meant that Elbasani were relegated for the first time. The club changed its name to Bashkimi Elbasanas in 1933, when they were playing in the second division, which they won and earned promotion back to the top flight, winning their first trophy in the process. In their first season back in the Kategoria e Par√´, they once again finished second form bottom with 2 wins, 2 draws and 8 losses. No competition was held during 1935 and when the league restarted in 1936 Bashkimi finished once again second from bottom, with 3 wins, 2 draws and 9 losses, but the team below them Ismail Qemali Vlor√´ played 2 fewer games and finished on the same points tally. The 1937 championship proved to be more successful as the club finished in 5th place out of 10 teams, with a record of 7 wins, 3 draws and 8 losses. The league officially restarted following World War II in 1945, where Bashkimi finished 3rd in Group B of the new league format, out of 6 teams. The following season they finished 2nd in Group B, just one point behind runners-up Flamurtari Vlor√´. For the 1947 season, the league changed to a single 9 team competition, where Bashkimi finished in 8th place. The following season the league returned to the 2 group format, where the club again finished second by one point to Flamurtari Vlor√´. The club changed names again to KS Elbasani in 1949 and KF Puna Elbasan in 1950. ===Labinoti Elbasan=== Between 1958 and 1991, the club was forcibly named KS Labinoti Elbasan, after a nearby village which had been the center of the first nationwide conference of the Party of Labour of Albania during World War II.Labinoti i Elbasanit 1984 dhe Bujar Gogunja ‚Äú1037‚Äù - Panorama In 1984, they won their first and only league title, featuring players like Roland Agalliu, Vladimir Tafani and Muharrem Dosti.Albania - Championship Winning Teams - RSSSF The club's first participation in a European competition came in 1984, where they met Danish side Lyngby Boldklub in the first round of the Champions League qualification stage. The first leg was played at the Ruzhdi Bizhuta Stadium and KF Elbasani were beaten 3‚Äì0 at home, and along with another 3‚Äì0 loss in Denmark the aggregate result was 6‚Äì0 to Lyngby Boldklub. ===KF Elbasani=== Following the fall of communism, the club changed its name again to KF Elbasani, which they have not changed ever since. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, the team of Elbasani dominated the Albanian Superliga and won the second title in their history, finishing the competition with 11 points more than their rivals in SK Tirana. In 2006‚Äì07, 1st qualifying round for the Champions League they were eliminated by FK Ekranas from Lithuania (1‚Äì3 aggregate). On 24 December 2006, coach Luan Deliu was fired and replaced by Edmond Gezdari. ==Stadium== Elbasan Arena Stadium 2014 The club plays its home games at the Elbasan Arena, which was originally built in 1967 and named the Labinot Stadium after the club's name at the time, which was Labinot Elbasan. The stadium was previously called Ruzhdi Bizhuta, after one of the club's most famous players. In January 2014 it was announced that the stadium would take over from the Qemal Stafa Stadium as the home of the Albania national team until Qemal Stafa is reconstructed. Prime minister Edi Rama visited the stadium on 28 January 2014 and he confirmed that work on the stadium would begin shortly, in order for Albania to be able to play their home games in the country as no other stadiums met the minimum requirements for Euro 2016 qualifiers.Rama: Elbasani pret komb√´taren Works on the stadium began in February, and they were completed in time for Albania's opening qualifying fixture against Denmark in October 2014. The overall reconstruction costs amounted to ‚Ç¨5.5 million, which included works being completed on everything from the parking lot to the installation of new floodlights, and the stadium now has an official seated capacity of 12,800.Stadiumi ne Elbasan: Rama, per te mos i mbetur hatri Vlores dhe Shkodres ==Honours== *Kategoria Superiore **Winners (2): 1983‚Äì84, 2005‚Äì06 *Kategoria e Par√´ (Tier 2) **Winners (4): 1933, 1958, 2001‚Äì02, 2013‚Äì14 **Runners-up (1): 2009‚Äì10 *Albanian Cup **Winners (2): 1975, 1992 *Albanian Supercup **Winners (1): 1992 ==European competitions record== {  - !

It gets its name for being found in the Sechura Desert in northwestern Peru. ==Description== The Sechuran fox is small for a canid, weighing , with a head-and-body length of and a tail of . Its fur is gray agouti over most of the body, fading to white or cream coloured on the underparts. There are reddish-brown markings on the backs of the ears, around the eyes, and on the legs. The muzzle is dark grey, and a grey band runs across the chest. Its tail is tipped with black. It has small teeth, adapted to feed on insects and dry plants, with fox-like canine teeth. The chromosome number is 2n=74. ==Distribution and habitat== First identified in the Sechura desert, the fox inhabits arid environments in southwestern Ecuador and western Peru, at elevations from sea level to at least , and possibly much higher. Within this region it has been reported from the western foothills of the Andes down to the coast, inhabiting deserts, dry forests, and beaches. There are no recognised subspecies. Several fossils of Sechuran foxes are known from the late Pleistocene of Ecuador and Peru, close to the modern range. Genetic analysis suggests that the closest living relative of the Sechuran fox is Darwin's fox, which is native to Chile. ==Behavior and diet== The Sechuran fox is nocturnal, and spends the daylight hours in a den dug into the ground. It is generally solitary, although occasionally seen travelling in pairs. Pups are born in October and November, although little else is known of its reproductive behavior. The fox is an opportunistic feeder, and its diet varies widely depending on the season and local habitat. It has been found to feed on seed pods, especially those of the shrub Prosopis juliflora and of caper bushes, as well as the fruit of Cordia and mito plants, and is capable of surviving on an entirely herbivorous diet when necessary. More commonly, however, it also eats insects, rodents, bird eggs, and carrion as a part of its diet. It can probably survive for long periods of time without drinking, subsisting on the water in its food. ==Conservation== The Sechuran fox is threatened by habitat loss, which has been particularly extensive in Ecuador. They have been known to prey on local livestock, such as chickens, and are hunted both to reduce such attacks and so that their body parts can be used in local handicrafts, folk medicine, or magical rituals. The animal is considered at Low Risk in Ecuador, and hunting is not permitted in Peru without a licence. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN. ==References== Sechuran fox Category:Mammals of Ecuador Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Near threatened animals Category:Near threatened biota of South America Sechuran fox ","title":"Sechuran fox"},{"id":"2209076","text":"19th-century illustration. Hans Kohlhase (c. 1500 ‚Äì 1540), according to early modern German accounts, was a merchant whose grievance against a Saxon nobleman developed into a full-blown feud against the state of Saxony, thus infringing the Eternal Peace of 1495. The campaign culminated in Kohlhase's execution in March 1540. == Background == In October 1532, according to the story, Kohlhase was proceeding from his hometown of C√∂lln to the fair at Leipzig, when he was attacked and his horses were taken from him by the servants of a Saxon nobleman, one G√ºnter von Zaschwitz. In consequence of the delay the merchant suffered some loss of business at the fair and on his return he refused to pay the rather large sum which Zaschwitz demanded as a condition of returning the horses. In return Kohlhase asked for a substantial amount of money as compensation for his loss, and failing to secure this he invoked the aid of his sovereign, the Elector of Brandenburg Joachim I Nestor. Finding however that it was impossible to recover his horses, he paid Zaschwitz the sum required for them, but reserved to himself the right to take further action. == Revenge campaign == Unable to obtain redress in the courts of law, Kohlhase in a feud letter threw down a challenge, not only to his aggressor, but to the whole of Saxony. Acts of lawlessness were soon attributed to him, and after an attempt to settle the feud had failed, the elector of Saxony, John Frederick I, set a price upon the head of the angry merchant. Kohlhase now sought revenge in earnest. Gathering around him a band of criminals and desperados, he spread terror throughout the whole of Saxony; travellers were robbed, villages were burned and towns were plundered. For some time the authorities were practically powerless to stop these outrages, but in March 1540 Kohlhase and his principal associate, Georg Nagelschmidt, were seized, and on the 22nd of the month they were broken on the wheel in Berlin. == Reception == Heinrich von Kleist's novel, Michael Kohlhaas, is loosely based on Kohlhase's life. The novel was made into three films: Michael Kohlhaas ‚Äì der Rebell in 1969, The Jack Bull in 1999 and Age of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas in 2013. Further, it was the inspiration for the character Coalhouse Walker, Jr. in E. L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime. == References == * * Peter Hafftiz, Microchronicon Marchium (c. 1600) s.a. 1540; edited in: Christian Sch√∂ttgen, Georg Christoph Kreysig, Diplomatische und curieuse Nachlese der Geschichte von Chur-Sachsen (part 3), Dresden, Leipzig 1731, 528‚Äì541; A.

Now the term is used more broadly to include similar bio-assemblages where ever they occur. In Portugal, the term mato or matagal is used to refer to the scrublands, or heaths, that formed on the Cambrian and Silurian schists in the north and central parts of Portugal.

KZSU broadcasts in stereo at 90.1 MHz FM with an effective radiated power of 500 watts. The station is owned by the Trustees of Stanford University and is governed by a Board of Directors appointed by the University's President. Operations are managed by a General Manager selected each year from the student body. ==Broadcasting history== Dish area KZSU began broadcasting on January 6, 1947, using the informal call letters KSU. Originally an AM carrier-current station, it relied on cables strung throughout Stanford's network of steam tunnels to carry its 590 kHz (later 880 kHz) signal. The first broadcast was a musical comedy revue starring Doodles Weaver. At first, the station broadcast only in the evenings. In the 1940s and 1950s, KZSU was a commercial station broadcasting popular and classical music, local cultural events, talk shows, and radio plays. The station was shut down for two years following a raid by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in August 1958, which resulted from rising interference with the signal of radio station KGO-AM at 810 kHz. Broadcasting resumed in the fall of 1960. Renamed KZSU at the behest of the FCC, the station received a noncommercial FM license in 1964, moved its transmitter from the center of campus to the nearby foothills in 1970, and upgraded its transmitter power from 10 to 500 watts in 1978. The AM carrier gradually died in the early 1980s. KZSU's all-volunteer staff is currently made up of locals as well as Stanford students and staff. While the height above average terrain (HAAT) of its 500-watt transmitting antenna is minus 3 meters (-10 feet), owing to proximity to mountains, its height above mean sea level (AMSL) is 155 m (509 ft.), giving it a vantage over the flat regions visible from the transmitter site. These include all of Stanford and Palo Alto, and much of the Peninsula and South Bay. KZSU says that its signal extends as far north as the San Francisco International Airport and south as San Jose. KZSU has also broadcast live on the internet since 1995. ==Programming== KZSU's programming includes the following: * The \\"Stanford Sadie\\" show, which ran from 1947 to 1961, was a notoriously racy satirical program based loosely on the Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally broadcasts of World War II. Sadie, whose mission was to distract male students from studying, was portrayed by approximately two dozen women over the years. * KZSU broadcast tapes of live shows recorded at a nearby coffeehouse called Top of the Tangent in the early 1960s. One of the bands caught on tape was Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, which later became the Grateful Dead. The recording, unearthed in 1997, has since been released on CD. * \\"Mystery Playhouse,\\" a series of classic and original radio dramas hosted by Dr. Morgan, produced over 200 episodes between 1986 and 1991. Dr. Morgan died in 1993, and the show is used for syndication and an informal tape-trading network. * \\"The Drum,\\" formerly hosted by DJ Kevvy Kev (Kevin Montague), was the world's longest-running hip-hop radio show until it went off air in the summer of 2011. It aired under this name since the late 1970s, but evolved from an earlier program called \\"Rhythms\\" that began airing some years earlier. John Graham hosted \\"The Drum\\" until 1981. Jonathan Brown (aka Johnny Afro) was host from 1981-1989. The last host, Kevvy Kev, was involved since 1984. Other Drum co-hosts from the period of 1984-1989 were DJ Easy Lou, Dj Rockmaster Marski, Rich D, & KutMasta Kurt. * \\"What Would Your Mother Say?\\", hosted by Susan Morris and produced by Sarah Buer, was an edgy talk show discussing life issues relevant to young people. Each week, a panel of four college students, Morris, and a mother met face-to-face interviewed a guest expert (an author, psychologist or pundit), on these subjects. * \\"Wednesday Night Live\\" is a weekly showcase of local band talent which has run since the late 1980s. Bands which have performed live in KZSU's \\"Outer A\\" studio include Green Day and Primus. * \\"Punker Than Puke\\" was a punk-oriented weekly program hosted by DJ Linus Up (Brent) and Johnny Gram in the early 1990s. Known for unscripted interviews with unscheduled Punk rock celebrities, surprise guests presented by the show included Jerry Only, Ian MacKaye, Chrissie Hynde, and San Francisco Area native Punk Rock musicians. * On September 6, 2004, KZSU held a \\"short song marathon,\\" consisting entirely of songs running one minute or less, with the goal of playing 1,000 songs in 1,000 minutes. A team of 18 disc jockeys succeeded played 1,104 songs in that span. Number 1,000 was ‚ÄúThe Young Lady Who Married a Mule Driver,‚Äù by James Downer. * In 2007, KZSU celebrated its 60th anniversary with a 60-hour music marathon, running from January 4-6, 2007. KZSU alumni joined current DJs for a retrospective focusing on one year per hour, beginning with the music of 1947 and moving forward through 2006. Special programming also included a lecture on the history of the station, archived airchecks from previous years, and an interview with one of the station's founders. Current programming at KZSU consists primarily of music, with an emphasis on independent new releases. KZSU's music library contained nearly 80,000 CDs and a similar number of vinyl discs as of December 2005. The station is also notable for its commitment to Stanford athletics. In recent years KZSU has carried live coverage of eight Stanford team sports throughout the year (football, men's and women's basketball and soccer, baseball, women's volleyball and softball). KZSU also produces news and talk shows, and simulcasts meetings of the Palo Alto City Council, and services from Stanford Memorial Church. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website * Listen to KZSU on the internet * Program guides * Geoff Goodfellow profile in The New York Times (2006) * Kevvy Kev profile in San Jose Metro newspaper (2004) * Stanford Sadie article in The Stanford Daily (1999) * Category:Freeform radio stations Category:Stanford University student organizations ZSU ZSU Category:Radio stations established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in California Category:Mass media in San Jose, California Category:Stanford Cardinal football broadcasters ","title":"KZSU"},{"id":"2209100","text":"The Koltsevaya line (, Circle line, ) (Line 5) is a line of the Moscow Metro. The line was built in 1950‚Äì1954 as a circle route orbiting central Moscow, and became crucial to the transfer patterns of passengers. The stations of the line were built at the height of Stalinist architecture, and include Komsomolskaya, Novoslobodskaya and Kiyevskaya. ==History== In the initial plans of the Metro's development, there was no provision for the Circle line. Instead it was planned for complete cross-city routes (\\"diameters\\") to cross the city centre with interchange stations at their intersections. However, after the opening of the second stage in 1938, it was clear from the excessive loads on those junctions, that this plan would be insufficient to deal with the growing number of passengers as the system expanded. An urban legend suggests that Joseph Stalin himself suggested the line when he placed a coffee cup on the original development map (with no ring) and then lifting it and leaving a circular stain around the centre of the city and said \\"It's your main fault, it should be built\\". It is thought this is the reason for the line's brown colour on all metro maps. In principle, the alignment of the ring was also debated, whether to use the Garden Ring avenue that encircles the centre or a wider circumference. In the end, it was decided to partially align the southern path along the Sadovoye Koltso, and let the northern part deviate to connect most of Moscow's rail terminals. This solved a major logistical problem, because, due to the layout of Russia's railroads, it would be impossible to travel from a region on one side of Moscow to another without having to make a manual transfer from one terminal to another. Construction began shortly after the end of the war. The first stage was opened in 1950 from Park Kultury to Kurskaya. In 1952 a second segment completed the northern deviation up to Belorusskaya and in 1954 the circumference was linked. The construction of the ring allowed for massive changes in the passenger flow patterns around Moscow and allowed a systematic development platform for many future lines. A total of seven radial lines began at the ring, four of which later linked up in the centre to become diameters. ===Timeline=== {  style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left;\\" - !Segment!!Date opened!!Length - Park Kultury ‚Äì Kurskaya  6.5 km - Kurskaya ‚Äì Belorusskaya  7.0 km - Belorusskaya ‚Äì Park Kultury  5.9 km - style=\\"text-align: right;\\"Total: 12 Stations 19.4 km } ===Name changes=== {  style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left;\\" - !Station!!Previous name(s)!!Years - Park Kultury Tsentralnyi Park Kultury i Otdykha Imeni Gorkogo 1950‚Äì1980 - Oktyabrskaya Kaluzhskaya 1950‚Äì1961 - Dobryninskaya Serpukhovskaya 1950‚Äì1961 - Prospekt Mira Botanicheskiy Sad 1952‚Äì1966 } ==Transfers== The Koltsevaya line, unlike other lines of Moscow Metro, does not service any stations that belong to that line exclusively; rather, all its stations are transfer stations, linking to other lines, as shown below: { - !Transfer to!!At -  Park Kultury Komsomolskaya -  Paveletskaya Belorusskaya -  Kurskaya Kiyevskaya -  Kiyevskaya -  Oktyabrskaya Prospekt Mira -  Taganskaya Barrikadnaya -  Marksistskaya -  Serpukhovskaya Mendeleyevskaya -  Chkalovskaya } ==Rolling stock== The line is serviced by the Krasnaya Presnya depot (No.4) and was the first one to adopt the 81-717/714 model trains in 1978. But replacement of those models by the 81‚Äì740.4/81-741.4, which started operating in revenue service on the line since early 2010, was completed by 1 December 2011. Four 81-717/714 trains from the Krasnaya Presnya depot in 2011‚Äî2018 were in service on Filevskaya line. Subway car types used on the line over the years: -Series G: 1950 - 1983 -Series 81-717: 1978 - 2011 -Series 81-740.4: 2009 - present ==Recent developments and future plans== Today the line is one of busiest, and the ever-rising passenger flows during rush hours are noticeably felt as most of the stations are over half a century old. In 1998 a second entrance was opened at Belorusskaya and there are plans to equip Park Kultury and Komsomolskaya with similar ones. Many restoration works are carried out to improve the old line, recently Novoslobodskaya had major restoration work carried out, including replacement of lighting and retouching on the stained glass masterpieces by Pavel Korin. The vestibule of Taganskaya was closed in 2005 to replace old escalators and upgrade with new turnstiles and also cosmetically renovate it, this was re-opened in 2006, and shortly afterwards Dobryninskaya followed suit for a similar upgrade. Despite the fact that when opened, there were six stations left for future transfer provisions, this turned out to be too small for the growing system. Metro planned two additional stations on the line Suvorovskaya, which connect to the Lyublinsko‚ÄìDmitrovskaya line and Rossiyskaya, which would connect to the Kalininsko‚ÄìSolntsevskaya line. Some preliminary work had been performed on Suvorovskaya. In 2017, Metro terminated plans for both stations. A manager for the system indicated that the stations were unlikely to be completed as they were too technically complex, too long, and too costly to compete. Consequently, Vasiliev stated that the station was unlikely to be built.. On August 19, 2019 works on Suvorovskaya station construction site resumed .. == References External links== * Photos of the Koltcevaya line on Virtual photogallery Metro (RU) Category:Moscow Metro lines Category:Railway loop lines Category:Railway lines opened in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in the Soviet Union ","title":"Koltsevaya line"},{"id":"2209102","text":"Slide It In is the sixth studio album by British hard rock band Whitesnake, released in 1984. It was the first Whitesnake album to be released by Geffen Records in the US, but was remixed for the release there. Because of this, two different editions of the album exist, each with its own unique qualities. It was their fourth top 10 album in the UK, peaking at number 9. In 1988 the album re-entered the US charts due to the success of the self-titled Whitesnake album (1987), and is certified double platinum. It was the final Whitesnake recording to use the band's original \\"snake\\" logo. The album eventually sold over four million records. The band delivered a harder sound than their previous albums. ==Recording process and personnel changes== Recordings of Slide It In began in 1983 at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany with producer Eddie Kramer, who had been suggested to David Coverdale by Geffen Records A&R; executive John Kalodner. But things within the band were not the same as they were before, as stated by Micky Moody in a 1997 interview: ===Moody's departure and new line-up=== Moody completed the recording of the whole album with new producer Martin Birch, who had replaced Kramer after his dismissal for lack of feeling with the band. He also co-wrote the song \\"Slow an' Easy\\", but things came to a head in late 1983. According to Moody, Coverdale's personality had changed compared to when they got to know each other in 1976. \\"Me and David weren't friends and co-writers anymore. David never said anything to me. He just didn't socialise with me anymore. David was a guy who five, six years earlier was my best friend.\\" Moody finally decided to leave Whitesnake when Coverdale embarrassed him in front of Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes, who were touring alongside Whitesnake. Apparently, this did not seem to be a major problem to Coverdale, as, according to Moody, \\"After the gig, I said to the tour manager, 'I want to have a meeting in my room with all the band: I have something to say'. The other band members arrived and I said, 'Where is David?'. The tour manager came and told me, 'David is entertaining people in his suite, and he won't come down.'\\" Soon after Moody's departure, John Sykes was announced to the press as the new Whitesnake guitarist. At the same time it was in the news that Hodgkinson had been fired, as Coverdale felt that his style did not suit Whitesnake's new sound. As a result of Hodgkinson's departure, Neil Murray was asked to rejoin Whitesnake. ===UK release: mixed reactions=== When the UK release of Slide It In came out, it was a chart success, but was heavily criticized for the \\"double-entendre drenched lyrics and titles for which Whitesnake were already infamous\\" and for the album mix, which was deemed \\"resoundingly flat\\". This was soon to change, as Whitesnake's US label, Geffen Records, insisted the album be remixed. With the help of famous producer Keith Olsen, Slide It In had its sound revamped, having a bigger and at the time a more modern sound, as well as giving John Sykes and Neil Murray the opportunity to replace Moody's guitar parts and Hodgkinson's bass parts, respectively. ===European tour=== Whitesnake engaged in a European tour with the Coverdale / Sykes / Galley / Murray / Lord / Powell line-up, but the band ran into trouble when Mel Galley got involved in an accident which damaged some nerves in his arm, making him unable to play the guitar. He continued as a Whitesnake member for a time, but was fired not long after. The five-piece continued touring until April 1984, until another line-up change followed. In April 1984 the Deep Purple reunion was imminent, and Jon Lord played his last Whitesnake concert on 16 April at Grand Hotel in Stockholm, Sweden which was filmed for the \\"M√•ndagsb√∂rsen\\" Swedish TV show. Lord's departure now left Whitesnake as a four-piece, not counting the off-stage keyboard player Richard Bailey, who was brought into the band. ===US release: big break=== The US edition of Slide It In rapidly gained airplay in the United States, suddenly increasing the demand for Whitesnake. The more streamlined, four-piece version of the band started touring the United States supporting Quiet Riot and then Dio. The extensive touring, along with the MTV-ready promotional videos for the songs \\"Slow an' Easy\\" and \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\", helped the American market to open itself for Whitesnake, something which would lead to the band breaking big on the United States with their 1987 album three years later. ==Album versions== The European edition of the album contains the original mix. This mix features a stronger presence of keyboards by Jon Lord, and the bass is more noticeable. The track order is also different from the US mix. The US mix lowers the keyboards and bass in the mix, and is more oriented around the guitars and drums. The US version features some different guitar solos to the European edition, with the addition of John Sykes as a third guitarist layered on top of the original guitar parts recorded by Mel Galley and Micky Moody. The bass guitar parts which were originally recorded by Colin Hodgkinson were replaced by returning member Neil Murray's bass guitar parts. The US version also included some new keyboard parts by Bill Cuomo. There are also other, more subtle differences in the mix. For instance, on the track \\"Gambler\\" on the UK version, Coverdale's voice echoes after every line he sings ‚Äì this does not happen in the US mix. On the track \\"Slow an' Easy\\", the US version has more echo. In 2009, the album was re-issued as a 2-disc digipack to commemorate its 25th anniversary. On the first disc, the CD contains the entire US mix of the album and 8 of the original UK mixes digitally remastered. The UK mixes of \\"Hungry for Love\\" or \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\" are not included, but the acoustic version of \\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\" is featured (taken from Starkers in Tokyo). A DVD containing promo videos and live performances is also included. Notable is that the two songs on the \\"Guilty of Love\\" single (\\"Guilty of Love\\" and the B-side \\"Gambler\\") are the only released material from the first sessions with producer Eddie Kramer. The same songs were included as bonus tracks on the 2CD version of the 2019 remaster. Rhino Records released a version in 2017 with the 2009 remastered tracks but a new track listing. https://www.rhino.com/product/slide-it-in A deluxe remaster version was released on 26 February 2019 in a number of configurations: CD, 2CD, 2LP and a super deluxe 6 CD+DVD box. The 6CD/DVD collection features remastered versions of the UK and US versions of Whitesnake‚Äôs sixth studio album, a 35th anniversary remix, along with previously unreleased live and studio recordings, music videos, live footage and a new interview with vocalist David Coverdale. The double CD edition features the remastered versions of the UK and US mixes along with bonus tracks, the 2LP has the UK and US mixes, while the single CD is the new 35th anniversary remaster by Christopher Collier. https://www.loudersound.com/news/whitesnakes-1984-album- slide-it-in-set-for-deluxe-reissue ==Track listingsUK release=US and Canadian release=PersonnelWhitesnake=== * David Coverdale ‚Äì lead vocals * Mel Galley ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals * Micky Moody ‚Äì guitars * Colin Hodgkinson ‚Äì bass * Cozy Powell ‚Äì drums * Jon Lord ‚Äì keyboards * John Sykes ‚Äì guitars on US release * Neil Murray ‚Äì bass on US release ===Additional musicians=== * Bill Cuomo ‚Äì additional keyboards on US release ===Production=== *Martin Birch - producer, engineer, original mixing *Keith Olsen - remixing at Goodnight Los Angeles *Greg Fulginiti - mastering at Artisan Sound Recorders *John Kalodner - A&R; ==ChartsAlbum=== {  style=\\"width:330px;\\" - ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Year ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Chart ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Position -  rowspan=\\"9\\"1984  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Finnish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" UK Albums Chart 9 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Norwegian Albums Chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"11 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Swedish Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"12 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Swiss Albums Top 100  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"12 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" German Albums Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"14 -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Japanese Oricon LP Chart  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"24 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Billboard 200 (USA)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"40 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" New Zealand Albums Chart  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"46 } ===Singles=== {  style=\\"width:500px;\\" - ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Year ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Title ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Chart ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Position - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1983 \\"Guilty of Love\\" UK Singles Chart 31 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"1984 \\"Give Me More Time\\" UK Singles Chart 29 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" \\"Standing in the Shadows\\" UK Singles Chart 62 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"\\"Love Ain't No Stranger\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Mainstream Rock (USA)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"34 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"1985 UK Singles Chart 44 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"\\"Slow an' Easy\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Mainstream Rock (USA)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"17 } == Certifications == {  - Country Organization Year Sales - USA RIAA 1992 2x Platinum (+ 2,000,000) } ==References== Category:Whitesnake albums Category:1984 albums Category:Albums produced by Martin Birch Category:Geffen Records albums Category:Liberty Records albums Category:Warner Records albums ","title":"Slide It In"},{"id":"2209104","text":":This is a sub-article to Uthman Uthman ibn Affan (Arabic: ÿπÿ´ŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÅÿßŸÜ) (c. 583 - June 17, 656) was the third Caliph of the Ummah, and is regarded by the Muslims as one of the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs.

Sadkin grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida across the street from Bennett Elementary School, and played saxophone in Sunrise Junior High School and Fort Lauderdale High School. Sadkin attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables for his first year of college as a biology major. He attended Florida State University in Tallahassee where he played bass guitar with childhood friends Lyle LaBarbera (rhythm guitar) and Jim Hendee (drums), and singer Phil Turk. He eventually received his Bachelor of Science degree in geology in 1971. He got his start in the music industry as a saxophonist for the Las Olas Brass in Fort Lauderdale. After graduation, Sadkin worked with Jim Hendee at a sea turtle farm called Mariculture, Ltd. on Grand Cayman Island, where they both lived on Seven Mile Beach, a few miles from the town of Hell. During their six months of living and scuba diving there, they got their first taste of playing reggae at several clubs around the island. When Sadkin returned to South Florida he began his recording career. He was first trained as a mastering engineer but eventually moved into recording studio work as a \\"tape-op\\" (Assistant Engineer) at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. He got his first big break after impressing Neil Young with his mixing ability, and he eventually became head engineer at Compass Point Studio in Nassau, Bahamas. He worked alongside Island Records boss Chris Blackwell on many of the label's projects, most famously with Bob Marley and the Wailers, including the seminal Rastaman Vibration. A full member of the Compass Point All Stars from day one, he began producing artists for Island Records (Grace Jones, Marianne Faithfull, Robert Palmer, Joe Cocker), while doing mixing work for other labels (Talking Heads). Among the other artists he produced in the 1980s are James Brown, the J. Geils Band, Thompson Twins, Classix Nouveaux, Foreigner, Duran Duran, Simply Red, Arcadia and Paul Haig. Sadkin produced the first two of the Thompson Twins' (as a trio) albums, Quick Step & Side Kick (1983) and Into the Gap (1984) as well as the original UK single release of \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\", in late 1984. However, the band parted company with him as the producer for their next album and opted to produce Here's to Future Days by themselves in Paris; right before its release after the collapse of the singer Tom Bailey, the release was postponed. The postponement caused them to rethink the project and producer Nile Rodgers was subsequently called in to rework the album with them along with Sadkin's production of the single \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" and released in 1985.Thompson Twins#International success Sadkin was a mentor to engineer and producer Phil Thornalley, who would go on to work with The Cure, Johnny Hates Jazz, and Natalie Imbruglia. He had a special gift of being able to sense and analyze an artist's inner creative abilities and talents, even if the artist couldn't. Composer-keyboardist Wally Badarou had this to say about Sadkin: \\"His dedication to maintaining genuine 'mixes in progress' from the word go, was a great lesson. I made it a system for my subsequent production from then on.\\" Sadkin died in a motor accident in Nassau at the age of 38, shortly after completing production work on Boom Crash Opera's eponymous 1987 album, and just before he was due to begin working with Ziggy Marley. The songs \\"Do You Believe in Shame?\\" by Duran Duran, \\"Gone Too Soon\\" by Robbie Nevil, and Grace Jones' \\"Well Well Well\\" are all dedicated to his memory. Joe Cocker's album Unchain My Heart (1987) is dedicated to the memory of Alex Sadkin, the quote from the album cover stating 'A Man who lived for music, and a good friend'. == Selected production credits == * Stephen Stills ‚Äì Illegal Stills (1976)‚ÄîMixing * Stills-Young-Band ‚Äì Long May You Run (1976)‚ÄîMixing * Third World ‚Äì Journey to Addis (1978) * Bob Marley and the Wailers ‚Äì Survival (1979) * Grace Jones ‚Äì Warm Leatherette (1980) * Robert Palmer ‚Äì Clues (1980)‚ÄîMixing * Grace Jones ‚Äì Nightclubbing (1981) * Grace Jones ‚Äì Living My Life (1982) * Joe Cocker ‚Äì Sheffield Steel (1982) * Thompson Twins ‚Äì Quick Step & Side Kick (1983) * Paul Haig (ex-Josef K) ‚Äì Rhythm of Life (1983) * Talking Heads ‚Äì Speaking in Tongues (1983)‚ÄîMixing Credit * Duran Duran ‚Äì Is There Something I Should Know?

Educated at Hawick, and at the universities of Edinburgh and Durham, he studied composition under Jean Roger-Ducasse in Paris. In 1925, he became Lecturer in Music at Jordanhill Training College for Teachers, Glasgow, a post he held for more than twenty-five years. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Glasgow in 1957.

The studios of WYAB are located within the Cotton Exchange Plaza in Flora, Mississippi. ==History== WYAB originally began as WAZF-FM in 1984 as a vacant allotment in the FCC's Table of Allotments, which is essentially a community-by-community listing of all radio station channels and classes within the United States and its territories. The initial allotment was for a 3,000 watt station to broadcast on 93.7 FM to serve Yazoo City. The allotment was created by a company known as Dri-Two, Inc. to serve as a \\"sister\\" FM station to the now silent WAZF 1230 AM, also licensed to Yazoo City. The vacant allotment sat without an actual broadcast station occupying its place from 1984 until 1995, when Mississippi College, license holder of WHJT 93.5 FM, petitioned the FCC to have the allotment removed from the Table. The college intended to upgrade the facilities of WHJT in nearby Clinton from 3,000 watts to 6,000 watts, something that could not have been accomplished with interference from a potential station on 93.7 FM in Yazoo City. After some public interest in the retaining the allotment at Yazoo City, the FCC developed an alternate solution that could accommodate all parties. The FCC moved the vacant allotment from 93.7 FM to 93.1 FM and granted the WHJT upgrade. After making the frequency change in 1995, the FCC solicited interest from parties intent on building a radio station on 93.1 FM in Yazoo City. Although two parties expressed interest in the station during the frequency change stage (individual Clifton Thomas of Jackson and Dain Schult Radioactivity, Inc. of East Point, Georgia), a local third contender, Gordon (\\"Jerry\\") J. Lousteau, Jr., of WMGO 1370 AM in Canton was the only person that responded to the FCC's public notice, and therefore his WMGO Broadcasting Corporation was granted the license. He placed the station on the air in 1997 and it was known as WMGO-FM. The original studio was located at 1307 East Broadway Street in Yazoo City. In April, 2003, the WMGO Broadcasting Corporation sold the station to SSR Communications, Inc., and to avoid confusion of the still operating WMGO 1370 AM in Canton, SSR changed the WMGO- FM call letters to WYAB, branding it \\"B93: Central Mississippi's Oldies Leader\\". Approximately one year later, SSR moved the WYAB air studio to the Cotton Exchange Plaza in Flora, a town approximately south of Yazoo City. In January, 2005, WYAB's city of license was changed from Yazoo City to the town of Benton, a community approximately six miles east of Yazoo City. This change in city of license was necessary for WYAB to move its tower approximately ten miles south of its original location. Then, in December, 2005, WYAB began broadcast operations from its new tower site ten miles (16 km) south of Benton. In February, 2008, WYAB received approval from the FCC to change its broadcast frequency from 93.1 MHz to 103.9 MHz and (once again) relocate its tower closer to Flora, which is where the air studio is located. Concurrent with that action, the FCC allowed WYAB to change its community of license from Benton to Flora, marking the third different community of license that the station has had in its relative short history. On August 28, 2008, WYAB began broadcasting from a tower site approximately five miles northeast of Flora. Concurrent with this latest tower move, WYAB migrated formats from oldies to talk radio. For a short time thereafter, WYAB had still retained some ties to its oldies music origins, as it aired a weekly three-hour-long oldies show on an irregular schedule every weekend (most often dictated by its weekend sports schedule). Just five months later, on January 24, 2009, WYAB moved again to a tower three miles (5 km) southeast of Flora, the fourth different broadcast facility for the station. At the same time, WYAB announced that it would become the new flagship radio station of the Mississippi Braves minor league baseball team. On September 13, 2010, WYAB moved once again to a new tower in Hinds County, approximately six miles northwest of Jackson. Thus, from December, 2005 to September, 2010, the station had broadcast from five different antenna locations, moving approximately closer to Jackson (when compared to the original tower location) in the process. ==2002 Listing on eBay== WYAB (then WMGO-FM) holds a rather unusual distinction in the annals of radio station transaction history. In April 2002, then-owner Jerry Lousteau placed the radio station up for sale on eBay, gaining national attention within the broadcast industry as one of the first owners to attempt to sell a radio station via an Internet auction. The purchase price was listed at $210,000.00, with the listing reading: > Name your own format. Be your own boss. You are bidding on the assets of the > station, including tower, antenna, and studios. This is not a toy. Covers > over 100,000 people! Ultimately, the listing for WMGO-FM garnered no qualified bidders. SSR Communications, Inc. purchased the station from Mr. Lousteau after the extensive press coverage within broadcast trade publications regarding the attempted eBay sale. ==Format and Programming== When the station was put on the air in 1997, it had broadcast oldies hits from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In August, 2008, the station migrated to a talk radio format, featuring personalities such as Michael Savage, Jim Thorn, Clark Howard, Kim Wade, Doctor Livingston, Mike Madison, James Tulp, Phil Valentine, Bill Handel, and Leo Laporte. WYAB is the \\"flagship\\" home for the Mississippi Braves, as well as the Tri County Academy football, boy's and girls basketball, and baseball teams. WYAB also serves Madison Central High School with select live broadcasts of its boy's and girls basketball games, as well as its baseball team. WYAB is also the sole local affiliate of Louisiana State University athletics. WYAB airs many local and community-oriented programs as well numerous public affairs programming, and special events and news reporting. ==Broadcast Site History== Currently, WYAB broadcasts on 103.9 FM from a site six miles (10 km) northwest of Jackson with 5,400 watts of effective radiated power. The tower is located on F.O.A. Road in Jackson, Mississippi. Full power broadcasts began at 2:45 p.m. on September 13, 2010. The tower is the fifth broadcast site that the station has had over the course of its (relatively short) history. The population served within WYAB's 60 dBu (1.0 mV/m) coverage area is approximately 384,354 persons. From January, 2009, until September, 2010, WYAB had broadcast on a high tower three miles (5 km) southeast of Flora, on top of Mount Leopard. From August, 2008, until January, 2009, WYAB's broadcasts were from a high tower five miles (8 km) northeast of Flora. Tower construction started on August 20, 2008 with broadcast operations commencing at 5:35 a.m. on August 28, 2008. The first song played was the \\"Theme from Star Trek, the Original Series\\". From December, 2005, until August, 2008, WYAB had broadcast on 93.1 FM from a high tower nine miles (14 km) north of Flora with the same power level. Tower construction started in November 2005 with broadcast operations commencing at 8:15 p.m. on December 13, 2005. The first song played was \\"Georgia On My Mind\\", as performed by Ray Charles. At the time, the population served within WYAB's 60 dBu (1.0 mV/m) coverage area was approximately 161,000 persons. The tower still stands today, presently unoccupied. Prior to December, 2005, WYAB's broadcast tower facility was located at a site near Benton. The former high WYAB tower was dismantled in December 2006 after sitting unused for approximately one year. All four towers were designed, manufactured, erected, or maintained by the J. Crow Towerworks company of Philadelphia, Mississippi. ==Audience Demographics== WYAB's primary audience is between the ages of 45 and 64, with men making up a slight majority of the listeners. During certain dayparts, such as during the Clark Howard Show, however, WYAB's audience is skewed heavily in favor of women 25-64. WYAB also broadcasts numerous sports teams including the Mississippi Braves, which attract a large male audience. ==Staff== WYAB's current staff members: * Mike Adkins: Chief Engineer * Cliff Bowen: Show Host / News / Sales * Mike Madison: Show Host * Jim Thorn: Show Host / News / Sales * James Tulp: Show Host / Sales * Jameson Haygood: Show Host / Sales * Kim Wade: Show Host * Danielle Wesolowski: Accounting * Matthew Wesolowski: General Manager / Sales * Josh West: Sports Director / Sales ==External links== *WYAB Website * * Approximate Coverage Map Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1997 YAB ","title":"WYAB"},{"id":"2209135","text":"The Mostaghim family is one of the prominent Iranian families. ==History== The family began before the Qajar dynasty and has been one of the most successful families in Iran. After the fall of the Qajars, they relocated to the holy city of Ghom, 40 kilometers south of Tehran, where they managed to take over the market and own many villages. Their close ties to political leaders of the Pahlavi regime and also religious leaders of Ghom made them one of the few families to survive the Islamic Revolution with little to no damage. After the revolution, the family has partly relocated to northern parts of Tehran as the place of residence. ==Characteristics== They are known as a moderate religious family with keen interests in Iranian culture. Having a hierarchical structure, the oldest member of the family is also the head of the family who is consulted in all business matters. Mohammad Mostaghim, a world-renowned neurosurgeon, who is rumored to be in line as the next head of the family, currently resides in Canada with his family. Currently, the Mostaghim family owns and operates the Zafran and Persian-carpet industry along with close ties to flour-producing companies and lucrative businesses in Tehran's Grand Bazaar in Iran. ==References== *Kamali, C.

He designed the first Shay locomotive and patented the type. He licensed it for manufacture through what became known as Lima Locomotive Works in Ohio; from 1882 to 1892 some 300 locomotives of this type were sold. ==Early life and military service== Ephraim Shay was born on July 17, 1839, in Sherman Township, Huron County, Ohio. His parents were James and Phoebe (Probasco) Shay, whose families went back to colonial New York. His parents were of majority-English descent, with some Dutch and Polish ancestry. His mother's paternal line descended from immigrant George (Jurriaen) Probatski, who was from Breslau, Silesia (now Wroclaw, Poland). In 1654 Probatski went to the Netherlands and immigrated with some Dutch via Amsterdam and Brazil to New Netherland (New York). Over time, through Dutch and English marriages and variations, the name in the United States evolved to Probasco,Probasco/Bartoszewski/Bartos DNA Study - Results, Family Tree DNA, accessed 17 December 2015 probably within the first few generations. In 1861, Shay moved as a young man of 22 with family to Muir, Michigan. Shortly after he enlisted in Company D, 8th Missouri Volunteer Infantry. In his American Civil War diary, Shay wrote, \\"Received marching orders. Quite a coincidence; on the day I am 22 years old I start on my first expedition to defend my country's honor and flag.\\" Shay served in the Western Theatre of the war, under General William Tecumseh Sherman. He was honorably discharged in 1864, and returned to Ohio to marry. ==Marriage and early career== Shay married his sweetheart Jane Henderson on July 26 of that year. The young couple moved to Ionia County, Michigan, to be near his family members in Portland, Lyons, Muir, and Sebewa. In 1870 they moved to Sunfield, Michigan, where Shay operated a steam sawmill. Their son, Lette, was born there on January 26, 1870. ==Lumber and locomotive== 1923 Shay locomotive, West Side Lumber Co. #9, in service on the Midwest Central Railroad. After 1873, the Shay family moved to Haring, Michigan, where Shay established a general store and sawmill, basics in a frontier town. In 1876 or 1877, he had the idea to use a locomotive to haul logs. He experimented with using maple strips on pine rails, to build rapid paths for a locomotive to travel in the forests, and developed the Shay locomotive. Shay started working with Lima Machine Works (later Lima Locomotive Works) in Lima, Ohio, licensing them to manufacture this model. In 1880, the first Shay Locomotive was shipped to a customer in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a center of logging on the Michigan peninsula. In 1881, Shay started filing patents for his works. William E. Woodard assisted Lima with improving the design of the engine. Lima built four Shay locomotives in 1881, and 37 Shays in 1883. In 1884, Lima had a 34-page catalog, featuring five models of Shay Locomotives. From 1882 to 1892, Lima sold some 300 of the Shay locomotives. By the late 1890s, Shay Locomotives were shipped around the world. ==Experiments with steel== In 1888, Shay and his family moved to Harbor Springs, Michigan on Little Traverse Bay. There, he designed and built in about 1892 what is now known as the Shay Hexagon House, a hexagonal-shaped structure. It has four wings opening off the central core and a two-story tower on top. The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The interior and exterior walls were stamped steel, an unusual use of this relatively new product. In 1891, Shay built an all-steel boat that was 40 feet long and a beam of 6 feet, named the Aha. Remains of the Aha have been returned to Harbor Springs and are preserved. Shay also designed and operated a private water works for the town of Harbor Springs. The use of steel for large lake freighters, developed in this period, was an important innovation to shipping on the Great Lakes. Shay established a railroad, the Harbor Springs Railway (nicknamed the \\"Hemlock Central\\"), chartered in 1902. It was dissolved in 1912. Three locomotives of Shay's design were the only motive power. The railway primarily hauled lumber, but was also used for sightseeing. Shay also made sleds with maple runners as Christmas gifts for local children, more than 400 sleds in total. Shay's wife Jane died on July 24, 1912. He died on April 19, 1916. He is buried in the Lakeview Cemetery in Harbor Springs. The Harbor Springs Area Historical Society annually sponsors the \\"Shay Days\\" festival at Hexagon House, on a weekend close to Shay's birthday. In 2005, the festival was held July 15, July 16, and July 17. == Gallery == File:2009-0619-HarborSprings-Hex.JPGThe Hexagon House today. ==References Sources == * Kyle Neighbors (1969) THE LIMA SHAYS ON THE GREENBRIER, CHEAT & ELK RAILROAD COMPANY, ASIN B001M07YHO * Michael Koch The Shay Locomotive: Titan of the Timber, World Press; Limited ed edition (1971) ASIN B0006WIHIE == External links == * Ephraim Shay website * ShayLocomotives.com * Geared Steam Locomotive Works' Shay pages * Cass Scenic Railroad Category:1839 births Category:1916 deaths Category:American people in rail transportation Category:Locomotive builders and designers Category:American railroad mechanical engineers Category:19th-century American inventors Category:American railroad pioneers Category:People from Huron County, Ohio Category:People from Ionia County, Michigan Category:People from Wexford County, Michigan Category:Engineers from Ohio ","title":"Ephraim Shay"},{"id":"2209160","text":"Student boilersuit from Blekinge Tekniska H√∂gskola, Sweden (1998) Student boilersuit (Swedish studentoverall or studenthalare, Finnish opiskelijahaalari, Canadian Flightsuit or Coveralls or redsuits) are boilersuits widely used for specific events at universities and polytechnics in Sweden, Finland, and Canada. Typically, the suits are procured by the student associations of faculties or programmes. At the major Swedish universities (like Lund or Uppsala) the use of boilersuits is limited to engineering students, but their use has spread to students in other fields at some of the smaller university colleges. In Finland, boilersuits have also been foremost identified with engineering students, but see extensive use in all of the student organizations of Finnish institutions of higher learning, such as University of Helsinki and Aalto University. ==History and use== Finnish engineering students in student coveralls Student coveralls have become one of the most conspicuous academic traditions at some educational institutions, despite its short history. The use of overalls started in the Royal Institute of Technology in the late 1960s, and spread around Sweden and Finland during the 1970s. Apparently protective clothing was needed in excursions to companies, which soon led to use at parties as a way to identify students of different fields and organizations. The height of the use of the overall was reached in the late 1990s. Due to quick rise in popularity, most student organizations now offer the students a chance to purchase their own overalls during the freshman year. Since the 1990s, the custom has remained popular although perhaps in slight decline as the overalls are sometimes viewed to signal a lifestyle bordering on alcoholism and drunken misbehavior, up to the point where some pubs and clubs even choose to ban the use of overall uniforms. These boilersuits are not only seen in Europe. At McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, the McMaster Engineering faculty has had a group of representatives clad in red coveralls known as 'redsuits' for decades. Other faculties, societies and student residences have also adopted the suits as a form of identification during McMaster's Welcome Week. At University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario, the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering has a distinct group of student who wear coveralls to demonstrate their school spirit. Numerous people throughout the city and campus recognize students in these coveralls as U of T engineers and members of Skule (TM). The University of Waterloo Engineering Students in Waterloo, Ontario, are also identified by their navy blue or grey coveralls, often decorated with significant patches from various interests and activities the student has accomplished over their time at school. Ottawa, Ontario's Carleton University has representatives in dark blue Air Force style coveralls, aptly named the \\"flightsuits\\".http://cses.carleton.ca/culture/flightsuits Likewise, Western University in London, Ontario awards coveralls, nicknamed 'covies,' to student leaders within the Faculty of Engineering (in grey) and Medway-Sydenham Hall (in black). ==Design and appearance== Unlike coveralls generally, the student boilersuit isn't used for work, but mostly for parties. However, as the coveralls are meant to endure years of abuse, the wearer often being under the influence of alcohol, the coveralls are made of high quality fabric and usually at least somewhat waterproof. Practical additions such as zippered pockets of various sizes and belt loops are added by the manufacturer, and as a part of the manufacturing process the coveralls are sometimes printed with the particular student organization's logo and ads of the various sponsoring companies, ranging from small local enterprises to national divisions of multinational corporations. Often, the large corporations choose to sponsor the suits as a part of their recruitment campaign, ensuring that they have the attention of the graduating students when they enter the working life. An engineering student of the University of Vaasa wearing a boilersuit and an engineering student cap. The colour of the boilersuits is usually determined by the faculty or programme, which ‚Äî the subjects being many and colours few ‚Äî leads to quite spectacular colour combinations such as purple, turquoise or pink. Multicolored variants exist, but typically the suits are of one color. As it is customary to personalize the suits, they are almost invariably decorated with various badges, souvenirs and inexpensive gadgets. Occasionally a boilersuit will tell of its owner's interests, political views, personal history and even military experience. The time spent as a student can be seen from the amount of decorations one has added to his boilersuit, as all students start with blank boilersuits. There's also a practice of swapping a part of the suit with another person, typically with a partner or a close friend. Badges are also readily swapped, especially amongst friends who are of different organizations. Rarity of a certain badge can be considered a bonus. ==Traditions== Certain traditions relating to the use of boilersuits exist. Typically, a new student will be given permission to use their boilersuit during the later half of their first academic year, often after a certain number of \\"freshman points\\" have been collected by participating in various social events like parties and contests held by the organizations. During the first academic spring, the various engineering student organizations tend to host events during which the new students are officially taken as a members of their organization. During these events, the students often volunteer to go through a minor rite that often includes diving into a pool, lake or river with their newly issued boilersuits as a \\"student baptism\\". Typically in Finland these events are held around the largest student holiday of May 1 or Vappu, when thousands of students gather outdoors to celebrate. Lesser traditions can dictate that a student should sew his badges onto his boilersuit by hand, and that the boilersuit should not be cleaned except either by swimming in the suit or by hosing it down. In some schools, two students who are dating exchange the overalls leg part with one another to show that they are taken. In Finland, it is traditional that only engineering students wear their suits as overalls, while non-engineers should wear them as pants, tying the arms of the suit as a belt of sorts. ==Naming== The boilersuit may have local names at individual universities. The Swedish term is simply overall or studentoverall, also studenthalare, but it is sometimes nicknamed ovve. In Finland, the Finnish word for overall is haalarit and the Finland Swedish word is halare. The Canadians refer to them differently depending on the university or area. They are called flightsuits by Ontario's Carleton University, redsuits by McMaster University and coveralls by Western University. ==See also== * List of student boilersuit colours * Academic dress * Youth culture * Student cap ==ReferencesExternal links== *3m's overallproject Category:Jackets Category:One-piece suits Category:Uniforms Category:Academic dress Category:Student culture Category:Academia in Finland Category:Academia in Sweden ","title":"Student boilersuit"},{"id":"2209161","text":"Donald Burrows may refer to: *Don Burrows (1928‚Äì2020), Australian jazz musician *Donald Burrows (musicologist) (born 1945), Handel scholar and professor of music at the Open University ==See also== *Don Burroughs (1931‚Äì2006), American football player ","title":"Donald Burrows"},{"id":"2209162","text":"The Nier Prize is named after Alfred O.

Once this boot count reaches 90, AIDS hides directories and encrypts the names of all files on drive C: (rendering the system unusable), at which time the user is asked to 'renew the license' and contact PC Cyborg Corporation for payment (which would involve sending 189 US$ to a post office box in Panama). There exists more than one version of AIDS, and at least one version does not wait to mung drive C:, but will hide directories and encrypt file names upon the first boot after AIDS is installed. The AIDS software also presented to the user an end user license agreement, some of which read: : If you install [this] on a microcomputer... : then under terms of this license you agree to pay PC Cyborg Corporation in full for the cost of leasing these programs... : In the case of your breach of this license agreement, PC Cyborg reserves the right to take legal action necessary to recover any outstanding debts payable to PC Cyborg Corporation and to use program mechanisms to ensure termination of your use... : These program mechanisms will adversely affect other program applications... : You are hereby advised of the most serious consequences of your failure to abide by the terms of this license agreement; your conscience may haunt you for the rest of your life... : and your [PC] will stop functioning normally... : You are strictly prohibited from sharing [this product] with others... AIDS is considered to be an early example of a class of malware known as \\"ransomware\\". ==History== AIDS was introduced into systems through a floppy disk called the \\"AIDS Information Introductory Diskette\\", which had been mailed to a mailing list. Evolutionary biologist Dr. Joseph Popp, was identified as the author of the AIDS trojan horse and was a subscriber to this list. Popp was eventually discovered by the British anti-virus industry and named on a New Scotland Yard arrest warrant. He was detained in Brixton Prison. Though charged with eleven counts of blackmail and clearly tied to the AIDS trojan, Popp defended himself by saying money going to the PC Cyborg Corporation was to go to AIDS research. A Harvard-trained anthropologist, Popp was actually a collaborator of the Flying Doctors, a branch of the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF), and a consultant for the WHO in Kenya, where he had organized a conference in the new Global AIDS Program that very year.

Popp had been behaving erratically since the day of his arrest during a routine baggage inspection at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. He was declared mentally unfit to stand trial and was returned to the United States. P. A. Taylor, Hackers: Crime in the Digital Sublime, London, Routledge, 1999. Jim Bates analyzed the AIDS Trojan in detail and published his findings in the Virus Bulletin. J.

Bates, \\"High Level-Programs & the AIDS Trojan,\\" In: Wilding E, Skulason F (eds) Virus Bulletin. Virus Bulletin Ltd., Oxon, England, Feb., pages 8‚Äì10, 1990. He wrote that the AIDS Trojan did not alter the contents of any of the user's files, just their file names. He explained that once the extension and filename encryption tables are known, restoration is possible. AIDSOUT was a reliable removal program for the Trojan and the CLEARAID program recovered encrypted plaintext after the Trojan triggered. CLEARAID automatically reversed the encryption without having to contact the extortionist. The AIDS Trojan was analyzed even further a few years later. Young and Yung pointed out the fatal weakness in malware such as the AIDS Trojan, namely, the reliance on symmetric cryptography. They showed how to use public key cryptography to implement a secure information extortion attack. They published this discovery (and expanded upon it) in a 1996 IEEE Security and Privacy paper. A. Young, M. Yung, \\"Cryptovirology: Extortion-Based Security Threats and Countermeasures,\\" In: McHugh J, Dinolt G (eds) Symposium on Security & Privacy. IEEE Computer Society Press, Washington DC, pages 129-141, 1996. A cryptovirus, cryptotrojan, or cryptoworm hybrid encrypts the victim's files using the public key of the author and the victim must pay (with money, information, etc.) to obtain the needed session key. This is one of many attacks, both overt and covert, in the field known as Cryptovirology. ==ReferencesExternal links== #An early analysis of the trojan #THE COMPUTER INCIDENT ADVISORY CAPABILITY, by CIAC, on AIDS infection and distribution #The Original Anti-Piracy Hack, by George Smith, on the interesting AIDS EULA #Computer Viruses (A), by Probert Encyclopedia #AIDS Information Trojan, by CA #Aids Trojan, by CA Category:Ransomware Category:Trojan horses ","title":"AIDS (Trojan horse)"},{"id":"2209224","text":"Cyanolyca is a genus of small jays found in humid highland forests in southern Mexico, Central America and the Andes in South America.

It is mostly grown in Fujian Province and Guangxi Province in China. Because it is plucked later than Bai Mudan, the tea may be darker in color, but it should still have a proportionate green color. Some lower grades of Shou Mei may be golden in color with many black and red leaves, making a darker brew with more depth. Technically this tea, being a fourth-grade tea, is a by-product of Baihao Yinzhen tea production and uses Da Bai or Large White leaves. __TOC__ ==Tasting and brewing== The tea can be brewed very differently and there are many combinations that yield interesting results, but it is important to use good mineral water to bring out the sweetness and aroma of the tea and not to over brew or make a bitter and very strong brew. Typically, white teas are brewed at a lower temperature than black teas. Often temperatures such as 70 degrees Celsius is all that is required. Different steep times and different temperatures have a remarkably different effect on the outcome of the final brew, but two to five minutes is ideal. This is correct for western style brewing when one is making the tea in a mug or western teapot, but when a gaiwan or yixing teapot is used in the gong fu style of brewing where larger quantities of leaf and smaller quantities of water are used and shared amongst the tea drinkers, steep times of less than a minute and measured in seconds would be preferred. ==See also== * List of Chinese teas * * ==References== Category:White tea Category:Chinese teas Category:Chinese tea grown in Fujian ","title":"Shoumei tea"},{"id":"2209232","text":"Allan Jay Lichtman (; born April 4, 1947) is an American historian who has taught at American University in Washington, D.C. since 1973. Lichtman created the The Keys to the White House model, which he created with Russian seismologist Vladimir Keilis-Borok in 1981. The model uses 13 True/False criteria to predict whether the candidate of an incumbent party will win or lose the next election for the U.S. president.\\"The Keys to the White House\\", Madison Books, 1996, He ran for the U.S. Senate seat from Maryland in 2006, finishing in 6th place in the Democratic primary. Lichtman authored the 2017 book The Case for Impeachment, laying out multiple arguments for the impeachment of Donald Trump. ==Early life== Lichtman was born into a Jewish family in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School. Lichtman received his B.A. degree from Brandeis University in history in 1967, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude while also running track and wrestling for the school. In 1973, Lichtman received his Ph.D. from Harvard University as a Graduate Prize Fellow, also in history. ==Career== Allan Lichtman in 2010 ===Teaching=== Lichtman began teaching at American University in 1973, rising to chair of the History Department, and was named Scholar/Professor of the Year in 1993. Outside of the classroom, Lichtman has testified as an expert witness on civil rights in more than 70 cases for the U.S. Department of Justice and for civil rights groups such as the NAACP, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund and Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also consulted for Vice President Al Gore and Senator Edward Kennedy. He assisted the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigation into voting irregularities in Florida during the 2000 election, submitting his statistical analysis of balloting problems. Lichtman concluded \\"there were major racial disparities in ballot rejection rates\\". In the early 1980s while living in California as a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology, Lichtman had a 17-show stint on the game show Tic Tac Dough. He won $100,000 during his time on the show.Breslev, Dia, \\"AU Prof Gets the 'Dough Lichtman Wins $100,000,\\" American University Eagle, February 27, 1981. ===Author and commentator=== Lichtman is best known for the \\"Keys\\" system, presented in his books The Thirteen Keys to the Presidency and The Keys to the White House. The system uses thirteen historical factors to predict whether the popular vote in the election for President of the United States will be won by the candidate of the party holding the presidency (regardless of whether the president is the candidate). The keys were selected based on their correlations with the presidential election results from 1860 through 1980, using statistical methods adapted from the work of geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok for predicting earthquakes. The system then correctly predicted the popular vote winner in each of the elections since 1984. In 2000, he inaccurately predicted, using his system, that Gore would be the next president. Lichtman has provided commentary for networks and cable channels such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News. In August 2020, Lichtman announced the model's prediction that presumptive Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden would be elected president. Nate Silver has criticized Lichtman's \\"keys\\", writing that several of the keys are subjective. For example, two of the keys are whether the incumbent has charisma and whether the challenger has charisma. Silver wrote, \\"it‚Äôs awfully easy to describe someone as charismatic when he or she is ahead in the polls ‚Äî or when you have the advantage of hindsight and know who won an election.\\" In April 2017, Lichtman authored the book The Case for Impeachment, laying out multiple arguments for the impeachment of Donald Trump. The Financial Times gave The Case for Impeachment a positive review, writing: \\"Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations.\\" The Washington Post called it \\"striking to see the full argument unfold\\". New York Journal of Books recommended it as a resource, \\"if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought.\\" CounterPunch characterized the work as \\"a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act\\". The Hill gave the author praise, writing: \\"Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.\\" CBC News consulted law scholars that said the fulfillment of Lichtman's impeachment prediction was unlikely, especially with a Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. Trump was impeached by the U. S. House of Representatives on December 18, 2019, but acquitted by the U. S. Senate on February 5, 2020. ===2006 U.S. Senate race in Maryland=== Lichtman announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate from Maryland in the 2006 election to replace Senator Paul Sarbanes; in a playful opening television ad, he pledged not to be a \\"conventional politician\\" and jumped into the C&O; Canal in a business suit.Ann Marimow, Lichtman's Big Splash, The Washington Post (March 10, 2006). Lichtman was seen as a long-shot candidates, with low support in polls.Matthew Mosk & John Wagner, Long-Shot Candidates May Harm Cardin, The Washington Post (July 24, 2006). He criticized front-runner U.S. Representative Ben Cardin for his votes in favor of funding for the Iraq War. When Lichtman was not invited by the League of Women Voters to the Maryland Public Television debate, he and other excluded candidates (Josh Rales and Dennis F. Rasmussen) protested outside the Baltimore County television studio; Lichtman and his wife were arrested after a confrontation with a security guard. In 2006, both were acquitted on all charges.Allan Lichtman, Karyn Strickler, acquitted in 2006 TV studio incident, The Washington Post (September 1, 2006). Lichtman lost in the primary election to Cardin, receiving 6,919 votes (1.2%), landing him in 6th place in a field of 18. In October 2012, The Washington Post reported that he was still paying off a mortgage he took out in order to help fund his campaign. ==Awards and honors== Lichtman has received numerous awards at American University during his career. Most notably, he was named Distinguished Professor of History in 2011 and Outstanding Scholar/Teacher for 1992‚Äì93, the highest faculty award at that school. Honors include: * Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Scholar, California Institute of Technology, 1980‚Äì81 * Top Speaker Award, National Convention of the International Platform Association, 1983, 1984, 1987 * Selected by the Teaching Company as one of America's \\"Super Star Teachers\\" * Outstanding Scholar/Teacher, 1992‚Äì93 * Finalist, National Book Critics Circle Award for White Protestant Nation, the Rise of the American Conservative Movement, 2008 * Distinguished Professor of History at American University, 2011 * Winner, National Jewish Book Award, 2013 for \\"FDR and the Jews,\\" with Richard Breitman * Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, 2013 for \\"FDR and the Jews,\\" with Richard Breitman ==Books== * Historians and the Living Past: The Theory and Practice of Historical Study (Arlington Heights, Ill.: Harlan Davidson, Inc., 1978; With Valerie French) * Ecological Inference (With Laura Irwin Langbein, Sage Series In Quantitative Applications In The Social Sciences, 1978) * Your Family History: How to Use Oral History, Personal Family Archives, and Public Documents To Discover Your Heritage (New York: Random House, 1978) * Prejudice and the Old Politics: The Presidential Election of 1928 (Chapel Hill: University Of North Carolina Press, 1979; Lexington Books, 2000) * Kin and Communities: Families In America (Edited, with Joan Challinor, Washington, D.

This typically involves new stories for existing characters already developed within the franchise, but in some cases entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed. This is not necessarily the same as an adaptation, which is a retelling of the same story that may or may not adhere to accepted canon. Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe. ==Examples== Two prominent examples of media franchises with an expanded universe are Star Wars and Star Trek, which both have a wide range of original novels, comics, video games, and other media that add to the mythology of their fictional universe in different ways. In both cases, entirely new characters and situations have been developed that exist only within the expanded universe media. ==Canonicity== Although there are some exceptions, expanded universe works are generally accepted as canon, or part of the \\"official\\" storyline continuity. Otherwise, they are considered apocrypha. In some cases, characters created for an expanded universe are later featured in the primary works associated with that franchise, as in the cases of Aayla Secura and Grand Admiral Thrawn in the Star Wars franchise.

Its headquarters are in NW in Washington, D.C. NGLCC is the exclusive certifying body for LGBT-owned businesses known as LGBT Business Enterprises (LGBTBEs), and advocates for LGBT business inclusion in corporate and government supplier diversity programs. In October 2017, the organization changed its name from the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce to National LGBT Chamber of Commerce to better reflect the entire LGBT business community it serves. ==Overview== The NGLCC was co-founded in 2002 by Justin G. Nelson and Chance Mitchell. Nelson has served as president since the NGLCC was founded, and Mitchell has served as CEO over the same period. The organization celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2017. Their goal was to create an organization that could support LGBT business owners and showcase the diversity of talent in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. NGLCC provides direct links between businesses, corporate partners, government organizations and other community groups that support LGBT economic opportunity. In early 2004, NGLCC created a \\"diversity certification program\\", making the organization a national third-party certifying body for LGBT-owned businesses. The NGLCC has a network of more than 50 local, state, and international affiliate LGBT chambers of commerce, and serves to represent their economic interests and opportunities. The NGLCC offices employ approximately 15 full-time staff. The NGLCC runs an internship and fellowship program to support operations. NGLCC co-founders Justin G. Nelson and Chance Mitchell also serve on the board of directors.Board of Directors NGLCC senior executives also include Jonathan Lovitz, Sabrina Kent, and Anthony Wisniewski. In 2017 NGLCC released its first proprietary data, the \\"America's LGBT Economy Report\\".America's LGBT Economy Report Among the findings reported: a typical LGBT business has been in business, on average, for more than 12 years and that LGBT businesses contribute more than $1.7 trillion to the U.S. economy and have created more than 33,000 jobs. In 2018 and early 2019, as the leading public policy organization on behalf of LGBT- owned businesses, NGLCC won the public sector contracting inclusion of certified LGBTBEs in Orlando, FL; Nashville, TN; Baltimore, MD; Jersey City, NJ; and Hoboken, NJ, while also advancing statewide bills in New York and New Jersey. Currently, California, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania also include certified LGBT-owned businesses, along with major cities like Seattle, Newark, Columbus, and Philadelphia. ==Programs LGBT Business Enterprise (LGBTBE) Certification === Since 2004, the NGLCC has offered certification to businesses owned by LGBT people. This certification is intended to help corporate and government procurement teams source from LGBT-owned products and services, also known as supplier diversity. As of January 2019, NGLCC has certified 1104 businesses across the United States. Certification in a multi- step process involving an application and supporting documents, a site visit, and final approval before a national certification committee. In August 2007 the NGLCC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to provide opportunities for dual-certification as both a women-owned, and lesbian, bisexual or transgender-owned, business. In 2011 the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) began including active sourcing of LGBT certified businesses as part of the Corporate Equality Index, a national directory of gay-friendly workplaces. In 2017, HRC further expanded the index criteria to require LGBT-inclusion in supplier diversity programs as a stand- alone scored metric. In August 2017 it was announced that the Billion Dollar Roundtable will now include NGLCC certified LGBTBEs as a category of diverse vendors counted by corporations spending a billion dollars or more on procurement with diversity-owned firms. The Billion Dollar Roundtable was created in 2001 to recognize and celebrate corporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority and woman-owned suppliers. === Corporate partnerships === The NGLCC offers corporate membership. Over 200 companies are recognized as corporate partners of the NGLCC. Partnership provides benefits such as access to certified suppliers, recognition as supporters of the LGBT business community and opportunities to share best practice in supplier diversity. The NGLCC recognizes 10 companies as founding corporate members.http://www.nglcc.org/corporate/partners * IBM * Wells Fargo * JP Morgan Chase & Co * American Express * Intel * Wyndham Worldwide * American Airlines * Ernst & Young * Aetna * Motorola ===NGLCC National Dinner=== The NGLCC National Dinner is an annual awards event held in November to celebrate progress in the LGBT business community. It was first held in 2003 and has been continuously presented at the National Building Museum in Washington, DC. It is attended by businesspeople, LGBT equality advocates, and political figures. Honors bestowed at the NGLCC National Dinner include: NGLCC/American Airlines ExtrAA Mile Award, Corporation of the Year, Supplier Diversity Advocate of the Year, and LGBT Supplier of the Year. The NGLCC/American Airlines ExtrAA Mile Award recognizes an LGBT or allied person, persons or organization that have gone the extra mile to support LGBT equality. Previous NGLCC National Dinner Honorees have included: former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, NAACP Board Chair Emeritus Julian Bond, tennis legend and LGBT champion Martina Navratilova, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Actress Judith Light, MSNCB news anchor Thomas Roberts, and NBA player Jason Collins. === NGLCC International Business & Leadership Conference === Every summer the NGLCC holds the NGLCC International Business and Leadership Conference. The three-day educational conference delivers leadership programming, networking, and engagement opportunities for LGBT business owners and allies. Educational programs include keynote speakers, the annual B2B Boot Camp for certified LGBT Business Enterprises, a chamber development track, marketplace expo, and one-on-one matchmaker meetings. It has previously been held in cities including Washington, DC, Minneapolis, Seattle, Las Vegas (several times), Chicago, Dallas, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Springs. Over 1,200 people attended the 15th Anniversary 2017 NGLCC Conference in Las Vegas, NV. ==NGLCC Advocacy milestones== NGLCC ring NYSE Closing Bell The NGLCC became the first LGBT organization to ring the New York Stock Exchange Closing Bell on June 20, 2005. It rang the bell again on June 5, 2009 and January 10, 2011. In 2010 the NGLCC began international work (see above), eventually developing into NGLCC Global in 2013. In November 2011 the NGLCC unveiled a new Supplier Innovation Center covering a second floor in the building that houses their offices. The Supplier Innovation Center is designed to facilitate training opportunities and develop best practice for small businesses, and provide a space for local start-ups to operate. The NGLCC is offering scholarships to LGBT business owners in partnership with the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, to be held at the Supplier Innovation Center. In 2014, AB1678 became the first-in-the-nation public mandate requiring the intentional inclusion of certified LGBT Business Enterprises in contracting with a statewide agency, the California Public Utilities Commission. In 2015, Massachusetts became the first state to Include certified LGBTBEs in statewide contracting, enacted by Governor Charlie Baker with the guidance of the NGLCC. In 2016, NGLCC helped introduce the New York State Supplier Diversity Act to intentionally include LGBT, disability, and veteran owned firms in New York State contracting opportunities. That bill, along with a similar bill in New Jersey, are both in process with their respective legislatures. In 2018 NGLCC's advocacy and public policy team was responsible for the inclusion of certified LGBT Business Enterprises in the cities of Baltimore, MD; Jersey City, NJ; and Hoboken, NJ. That year the groundwork was laid for similar inclusion legislation to be implemented in Chicago, the District of Columbia, Nashville, Denver, and other major cities. ==NGLCC-affiliated chambers== The NGLCC works with more than 50 local, state and international chambers. In 2011, the NGLCC appointed a full-time position to oversee relations with affiliated chambers.http://nglcc.org/BIZ/community/NewLeadershipforAffiliateRelationsandCCBO The move is considered mutually beneficial to both local chambers and the national chamber. The NGLCC stopped national membership options in 2011, and all membership is now routed through affiliated chambers. Membership of an affiliated chamber infers membership of the NGLCC. Benefits for membership include a waiver of the fee required for supplier diversity certification. NGLCC corporate partners also offer benefits to members of affiliated chambers.http://nglcc.org/membership/memberoffers Relations between affiliated chambers, the NGLCC, and the LGBT business community are overseen by the Affiliate Chamber Council (ACC). ===Affiliated US chambers=NGLCC Global=== In 2010 the NGLCC hosted the first LGBT trade mission to Argentina, joined by U.S. LGBT businesses. The trade mission met with government officials and business counterparts and formalized relations with the Argentine LGBT Chamber of Commerce. In October 2011 the NGLCC traveled to Bogota to lay the groundwork for a future U.S. certified LGBT trade mission to Colombia. NGLCC Global, a division of the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, promotes the growth of small businesses and provides advocacy for broad-based economic advancement and empowerment of the global LGBT community. Through a variety of resources, NGLCC Global connects LGBT-owned and -allied companies, multinational corporations, and international affiliate chamber leaders and members. In 2016, NGLCC launched NGLCC Global LGBTI Business Week. Hosted by NGLCC in partnership with leaders and organizations committed to expanding global LGBTI economic opportunity, this was the first summit of its kind to converge economic, public policy, and global human rights experts with the goal of shaping a more equitable world for LGBTI citizens. The findings of the week were presented along with awards for top achievement in LGBTI business at the NGLCC National Dinner in Washington, DC, on Friday, November 18, 2016.

PRE is a form of common subexpression elimination. An expression is called partially redundant if the value computed by the expression is already available on some but not all paths through a program to that expression. An expression is fully redundant if the value computed by the expression is available on all paths through the program to that expression. PRE can eliminate partially redundant expressions by inserting the partially redundant expression on the paths that do not already compute it, thereby making the partially redundant expression fully redundant. For instance, in the following code: if (some_condition) { // some code that does not alter x y = x + 4; } else { // other code that does not alter x } z = x + 4; the expression \`x+4\` assigned to \`z\` is partially redundant because it is computed twice if \`some_condition\` is true. PRE would perform code motion on the expression to yield the following optimized code: if (some_condition) { // some code that does not alter x t = x + 4; y = t; } else { // other code that does not alter x t = x + 4; } z = t; An interesting property of PRE is that it performs (a form of) common subexpression elimination and loop- invariant code motion at the same time.Global Optimization by Suppression of Partial Redundancies, Morel and Renvoise, 1979Effective Partial Redundancy Elimination, Briggs and Cooper, 1994 In addition, PRE can be extended to eliminate injured partial redundancies, thereby effectively performing strength reduction. This makes PRE one of the most important optimizations in optimizing compilers. Traditionally, PRE is applied to lexically equivalent expressions, but recently formulations of PRE based on static single assignment form have been published that apply the PRE algorithm to values instead of expressions, unifying PRE and global value numbering. ==See also== * Value numbering * Redundant code * Dead code elimination == References  Further reading == * Muchnick, Steven S.

The upper reaches are culverted, some underground, through mostly urban landscapes, but once it emerges into the open it flows through a nature reserve and city parks before joining the tidal River Avon at Sea Mills. 18th-century water mills near the mouth gave the area its name. Portus Abonae was a Roman port at the mouth which provided an embarkation point for journeys across the River Severn to South Wales. In the 18th century there were short lived attempts at creating a port and a whale fishery here. The name Trym appears to have Anglo-Saxon roots. In recent years silting problems, caused by urban development, have caused some difficulties, but alleviation works have helped reduce the problem. ==Course== The Trym rises near Filton in South Gloucestershire, in the area of Filton Golf Club. and much of its upper course is culverted underneath 20th century housing. It surfaces in the Bristol suburb of Southmead, then flows open through Badock's Wood nature reserve. Just south of here is Henleaze Swimming Lake, a former quarry fed by springs, the overflow running into the Trym. The river is culverted through Westbury-on-Trym village. A sluice here is used to divert water into a storm drain in times of high rainfall to save the village centre from flooding. The Trym then disappears into culverts, re-emerging at Henbury Golf Club before entering the Blaise Castle estate, where it is joined on the right bank by the Hazel Brook above Coombe Dingle. The remains of Coombe Mill, which was fed by both the Hazel Brook and the Trym, can be seen here. Passing under Dingle Road bridge, the river then flows through Sea Mills river park, passing under the Portway and the Severn Beach railway line before joining the river Avon. A weir under the Portway prevents flooding upstream, except during the highest spring tides. ==Natural history== Badock's Wood in Southmead is a nature reserve managed by Bristol City Council. Areas of beech, oak and ash woodland support a range of other bushes and shrubs, including hazel, maple, hawthorn and blackthorn. Badock's Meadow, a former prefab housing estate, has been reseeded with native meadow plants including oxeye daisies, yellow rattle, wild carrot and knapweed. Wildlife includes native woodland birds including woodpeckers and owls, also pipistrelle bats. The Blaise Castle estate contains a variety of trees and plant life, also providing cover for birds and small mammals. Further downstream, just above Sea Mills, Himalayan Balsam and Japanese Knotweed, both invasive riverside plants, have established themselves. Ducks and moorhen can be found along many stretches of the river, with gulls and estuary birds near the mouth. A pollution incident by Wessex Water which allowed sewage to flow into the Trym in 2001, killing eels, sticklebacks and invertebrates, resulted in a fine following prosecution by the Environment Agency. Other pollution incidents have followed. ==History== Bridge crossing the River Trym at Coombe Dingle. At the confluence of the Trym with the Avon was the Roman port and small town of Portus Abonae, which took its name from the main river Avon, which simply means 'river' in British Celtic. Abona was a staging point for the Roman invasion of Wales and was at the western end of the Roman road from Silchester. In the 15th century there were tide mills at Millpill, near the mouth. An attempt was made in 1712 by the entrepreneur Joshua Franklyn to open a commercial dock at the mouth of the Trym, on the Roman site, but the venture foundered after a few decades. A whale fishery enterprise set up in 1752 was equally short lived. Parts of the dock walls can still be seen. ==Etymology== Linguistics sources indicate that the name Trym may derive from the Anglo-Saxon, meaning 'firm' or 'strong' one'. == Hydrology == The flow of the river has decreased in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway. The run-off sends a good deal of silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean. ==NotesFurther reading== *Mogford, Ernest H.

In the United States, certain public policies and laws regarding employment, military service, education and crime incorporate IQ or similar measurements. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting neurotoxic toxins, have as one of their goals raising or preventing a decline in intelligence. == Use of cognitive tests in the United States legal system and public policy  History === In the early 20th century, eugenics legislation was passed in many US states which allowed, or encouraged, sterilization of \\"feeble-minded\\" individuals. In the 1927 case Buck v. Bell, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes closed the 8-1 majority opinion upholding the sterilization of Carrie Buck, who along with her mother and daughter was labeled \\"feeble-minded\\", with the infamous phrase, \\"Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\\" Eugenics fell out of favor in the middle part of the century and is now widely denounced, though memories of the period continue to influence public policy. === US Education === Cognitive test scores predict educational performance better than they predict any other outcome, and cognitive testing is pervasive in academics. Central policy issues concern the proper role of testing in assessing educational quality and in college admission; efforts to characterize and close the educational achievement gap between racial and socioeconomic groups in the US; and the importance of cognitive ability differences in educational affirmative action. The existence of educational achievement gaps between racial and socioeconomic groups is broadly accepted; the source and stability of the gaps remain areas of active research and debate. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) is aimed explicitly at reducing achievement gaps by race. Federally defined formulas in NCLB call for elimination of all achievement disparity by 2014. Regardless of the source of the gap, most educators agree that it must be addressed. They often advocate equitable funding for education.Achieving Equitable Education in Calhoun CountyEducational Studies: A Jrnl of the American Educ. Studies Assoc. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted state and federal statutes to require that IQ tests not be used in a manner that was determinative of tracking students into classes designed for the mentally retarded. Larry P. v. Riles, 793 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1984). The court specifically found that the tests involved were designed and standardized based on an all-white population, and had not undergone a legislatively mandated validation process. In addition, the court ruled that predictive validity for a general population is not sufficient, since the rights of an individual student were at issue, and emphasized that had the tests not been treated as controlling but instead used as part of a thorough and individualized assessment by a school psychologist a different result would have been obtained. In September 1982, the judge in the Larry P. case, Federal District Judge Robert F. Peckham, relented in part in response to a lawsuit brought by black parents who wanted their children tested. The parents' attorney, Mark Bredemeier, said his clients viewed the modern special education offered by California schools today as helpful to children with learning disabilities, not a dead-end track, as parents contended in the original 1979 Larry P. case. A major area of controversy regarding the NCLB Act is whether achievement gaps are the result of \\"the soft bigotry of low expectations\\" or reflect real cognitive ability differences between groups.Gottfredson, L. S. (2005). \\"Implications of cognitive differences for schooling within diverse societies\\". In C. L. Frisby & C. R. Reynolds (Eds.), Comprehensive Handbook of Multicultural School Psychology. New York: Wiley (2005), . pre-print PDF PDF Because the Act includes warnings and funding consequences for schools which do not meet performance goals, whether disparate student performance is due primarily to environment (which is perceived to be under substantial school and teacher control) or to genetics (which is perceived to be far less malleable) has become a crucial issue. Gifted education and special education programs aim to provide tailored instruction to students with especially high or low ability. Research in both civilian and military training has demonstrated that bright individuals learn 2-5 times faster than their less able peers.Gottfredson, L. S. (2006). Social consequences of group differences in cognitive ability (Consequencias sociais das diferencas de grupo em habilidade cognitiva). In C. E. Flores-Mendoza & R. Colom (Eds.), Introducau a psicologia das diferencas individuais (pp. 433-456). Porto Alegre, Brazil: ArtMed Publishers. PDF === Employment === One summary of the relationship between employment policy and IQ testing is provided by Murphy (2002): > Cognitive ability tests represent the best single predictor of job > performance, but also represent the predictor most likely to have > substantial adverse impact on employment opportunities for members of > several racial and ethnic minority groups. Debates over the use of these > tests in selection often involve trade-offs between two criteria that are > valued by decision makers ‚Äì that is, efficiency and equity. Findings and > methods from decision research can help us frame these trade-offs, but in > most cases they cannot be avoided.Murphy, K.M., Can Conflicting Perspectives > on the Role of g in Personnel Selection Be Resolved? Human Performance, > 15(1&2):173-186 (2002). Before the late twentieth century, on the basis of studies showing widely varying validities for personnel selection techniques, the theory of \\"situational specificity\\" held sway. This principle holds that each organization, work setting and job is unique, requiring unique employee characteristics or skills, and that selection on any general ability yields little benefit.Locke, E.A., ed., The Blackwell Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior, Blackwell Publishers (2000), . However, the development of statistical techniques such as meta-analysis allowed large samples to be assembled from smaller studies, revealing that apparent validity variations reflected statistical artifacts. Re-analysis, and subsequent studies, have established that general mental ability (IQ) predicts job performance across all jobs.Hunter, J.E. and Hunter, R.F. (1984). Validity and utility of alternate predictors of job performance. Psychological Bulletin, 96(1):72-98. The validity of IQ varies most notably with job complexity: IQ matters little for simple jobs such as packing, and a great deal in complex jobs such as medicine. These findings have major significance. For example, racial groups differ in average performance on mental ability tests: East Asians on average score higher than Whites, who on average score higher than Blacks (see Race and intelligence for a more thorough discussion). Race-blind hiring on the basis of cognitive test score, among the best predictors of job performance, tends to lead to under-representation of some racial groups in favor of others, a phenomenon called \\"adverse impact\\" or \\"disparate impact\\" in employment law. (In contrast, \\"disparate treatment\\" refers to deliberate discrimination.) In 1971, in the case Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,FindLaw for Legal Professionals ‚Äì Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code the US Supreme Court handed down a seminal ruling which framed US public policy on adverse impact. Griggs concerned a company which had rejected a large number of Black applicants who either lacked a high-school education or performed poorly on a paper-and-pencil cognitive test. Referring to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the Court wrote, > The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are > fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone is business > necessity. If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes > cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is > prohibited. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act generally prohibits employment practices that are unfair or discriminatory. One provision of Title VII, codified at 42 USC 2000e-2(h), specifically provides that it is not an \\"unlawful employment practice for an employer to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that such test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\\" This statute was interpreted by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 US 424 (1971). In Griggs, the Court ruled that the reliance solely on a general IQ test that was not found to be specifically relevant to the job at issue was a discriminatory practice where it had a \\"disparate impact\\" on hiring. The Court gave considerable weight in its ruling to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulation interpreting Section 2002e-2(h)'s reference to a \\"professionally developed ability test\\" to mean \\"a test which fairly measures the knowledge or skills required by the particular job or class of jobs which the applicant seeks, or which fairly affords the employer a chance to measure the applicant's ability to perform a particular job or class of jobs.\\" In other words, the use of any particular test would need to be shown to be relevant to the particular job or class of jobs at issue. In 1989, the US Supreme Court decision in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. AtonioFindLaw for Legal Professionals ‚Äì Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code reduced the defendant's burden of proving business necessity to a burden of producing evidence of business justification. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 overturned that portion of the Wards Cove decision. These decisions added a legal dimension to trade-offs between \\"efficiency and equity\\" referenced by Murphy. Though cognitive testing is generally inexpensive, reliable and valid, US employers risk expensive legal action if such testing produces disparate impact. In practice, companies have responded with a variety of strategies, from abandonment of cognitive testing to maintenance of racial hiring quotas. The latter derives from enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's \\"four-fifths rule\\", which states that any group selection rate that is less than four-fifths (80%) of the highest rate will be regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.Uniform Employee Selection Guidelines Questions and Answers Attempts to formulate a test with reliability and validity equal to cognitive testing, but that does not produce disparate impact, have generally failed.Gottfredson, L. S. (2005). \\"Suppressing intelligence research: Hurting those we intend to help\\". In R. H. Wright & N. A. Cummings (Eds.), Destructive trends in mental health: The well- intentioned path to harm (pp. 155-186). New York: Taylor and Francis, . Pre- print PDF PDF Microsoft is known for using non-illegal tests that correlate with IQ tests as part of the interview process, weighing the results even more than experience in many cases. === US Military service === All US military recruits take the Armed Forces Qualification Test, an intelligence test that strongly measures the general intelligence factor. A recruit's cognitive test scores in part determine the professions available to him or her. Problems in training low-IQ military recruits during World War II led the US Congress to ban enlistment from the lowest 10% (below IQ 80) of the population.Gottfredson, L. S. (1998). The general intelligence factor. Scientific American Presents, 9(4):24-29. PDF Because people with IQs below 80 (the 10th percentile, Department of Defense \\"Category V\\") are difficult to train, federal law bars their induction into the military. As of 2005, only 4 percent of the recruits were allowed to score as low as in the 16th to 30th percentile, a grouping known as \\"Category IV\\" on the U.S. Armed Forces' mental-aptitude exam. During the Vietnam War, a program known as Project 100,000 was devised to recruit much more heavily from this category, but was eventually ended in 1971. The U.S. military uses the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT), as higher scores correlate with significant increases in effectiveness of both individual soldiers and units., === US Crime === In its 2002 ruling on the case Atkins v. Virginia, the US Supreme Court outlawed the execution of mentally retarded criminals on the grounds that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment, which is prohibited by the 8th Amendment. The designation of mental retardation (or developmental disability) typically requires a measured IQ below 70 or 75. The Supreme Court of the United States has utilized IQ test results during the sentencing phase of some criminal proceedings. The Supreme Court case of Atkins v. Virginia, decided June 20, 2002, held that executions of mentally challenged criminals are \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. In Atkins the court stated that :\\"...[I]t appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard to the mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided Penry. The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it.\\" In overturning the Virginia Supreme Court's holding, the Atkins opinion stated that petitioner's IQ result of 59 was a factor making the imposition of capital punishment a violation of his eighth amendment rights. In the opinion's notes the court provided some of the facts relied upon when reaching their decision Individuals with IQs below 70 have been essentially exempted from the death penalty in the U.S. since 2002, even though this cannot be definitely confirmed. === US Social Security === The Social Security Administration also uses IQ results when deciding disability claims. In certain cases, IQ results alone are used (in those cases where the result shows a \\"full scale IQ of 59 or less\\") and in other cases IQ results are used along with other factors (for a \\"full scale IQ of 60 through 70\\") when deciding whether a claimant qualifies for Social Security Disability benefits. == Race issues == Public policy implications of IQ and race research are one of the greatest sources of controversy surrounding race and intelligence research. Regardless of the source of the IQ gap, most educators agree that it must be addressed; they often advocate more equitable funding for education.Educational Studies: A Journal of the American Educational Studies Association An achievement gap refers to the observed disparity in the performance of groups of students, primarily in those defined by race or ethnicity, in educational measures such as standardized test scores, grade point average, dropout rates and course enrollment and completion rates. Some proponents of a genetic interpretation of the IQ gap, such as Rushton and Jensen (2005a) and Gottfredson (2005b), have sometimes argued that their interpretation does not in itself demand any particular policy response: while a conservative commentatorFor example, the policy recommendations of The Bell Curve were denounced by many. Herrnstein and Murray (1994) wrote: \\"We can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the wrong women. If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility. The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low- income women who have babies, be ended. (p. 548)\\" Two year later the 1996 U.S. welfare reform substantially cut these programs. In a discussion of the future political outcomes of an intellectually stratified society, they stated that they: \\"fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent ‚Äì not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but ‚Äôconservatism‚Äô along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below. (p. 518) \\"Moreover, they fear that an increasing welfare will create a \\"custodial state\\": \\"a high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation of some substantial minority of the nation‚Äôs population. They also predict increasing totalitarianism: It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states. (p. 526)\\" may feel the results justify, for example, reductions in affirmative action, a liberal commentator may argue from a Rawlsian point of view (that genetic advantages are undeserved and unjust) for substantial affirmative action.Gottfredson 2005b In the book Practical Ethics, philosopher Peter Singer wrote: > Let us suppose that the genetic hypothesis turns out to be correct... I > believe that the implications of this supposition are less drastic than they > are often supposed to be... First, the genetic hypothesis does not imply > that we should reduce our efforts to overcome other causes of inequality > between people...

Differences in health care, nutrition, regulation of environmental toxins, and geographic distribution of diseases and control strategies between the developing world and developed nations have all been subjects of policies or policy recommendations (see Health and intelligence). == References == * Sungthong, R., Mo-suwan, L., and Chongsuvivatwong, V., \\"Effects of haemoglobin and serum ferritin on cognitive function in school children,\\" Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition 11, no. 2 (2002): 117‚Äì22 Category:Race and intelligence controversy Category:Public policy ","title":"Intelligence and public policy"},{"id":"2209299","text":"Thomas J.

Blaustein. The film focuses on the lives of professional wrestlers outside of the ring, primarily Mick Foley, Terry Funk, and Jake Roberts, as well as some aspiring wrestlers. It focuses on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) during its rise in popularity, and many other independent wrestlers and organizations. The film was originally released in U.S. theaters in March 2000, and later on VHS and DVD. ==Plot== The film begins with director Barry Blaustein discussing his love for professional wrestling and clips of him viewing employees of the World Wrestling Federation and Extreme Championship Wrestling. He then decides to travel the United States over a three-year period, endeavoring to understand the mindset of someone who would voluntarily choose to become a professional wrestler. Blaustein interviews a wide variety of wrestling personalities and ascertains their motivations. Blaustein focuses on three famous wrestlers, one at the height of his career (Mick Foley, aka \\"Mankind\\"), one contemplating retirement (Terry Funk) and one at a career low (Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts). He begins by following Funk, a 53-year-old man in need of knee surgery who appears unable to retire, despite the mounting toll wrestling is taking on his body. Blaustein follows him as he competes at hardcore wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling's first pay-per-view event Barely Legal. Funk also appears with his friend, former wrestler Dennis Stamp, who is eager to work as a referee in Funk's upcoming \\"retirement\\" match. Stamp discusses the fact that he has not wrestled in years, but remains in shape just in case he gets the call, and demonstrates his unusual workout regimen: jumping on a trampoline in his back yard while holding hand weights. Funk's sometime in-ring rival, Foley, is profiled next. He has been taking increasingly risky falls (or \\"bumps\\") and blows to the head, and at one point is heard talking incoherently as the result of a fall (from his Hell in a Cell match against The Undertaker at King of the Ring in 1998) which briefly rendered him unconscious. Clips of Foley with his wife and children are spliced with the clips of him risking his body for the sport. Later, in the film's climax, his wife and young children (particularly his daughter Noelle) watch in horror from the front of the audience during Foley's \\"I Quit\\" match at the 1999 Royal Rumble, wherein he takes multiple unprotected shots to the head by Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson with a steel folding chair. For weeks after the match, Blaustein was haunted by seeing Foley's family reaction to the Royal Rumble match. Blaustein decided to show Foley and his wife the footage he captured at the event. After watching the footage, Foley admitted he felt guilty for putting his family through the ordeal, and said he never wanted put his family in that position again. Lastly, Roberts is a wrestler whose height of popularity was in the 1980s. Now he is a crack cocaine addict, and estranged from his daughter. Although he was once one of the more famous wrestlers in America, performing in front of tens of thousands of fans, he is now wrestling in small-town venues. In the course of the film, Roberts is shown attempting to reconcile with his daughter and being interviewed after reportedly smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room (the act is not shown on camera), as well as musing aloud about his increasingly illicit sexual dalliances while traveling. The careers of the three successful wrestlers are contrasted with those of wrestlers who have not yet achieved comparable success, such as two men getting started in the sport of wrestling, Tony Jones and Michael Modest, who are granted a tryout match for the WWF. In addition, Darren Drozdov is a former NFL football player who is shown in an interview with Vince McMahon. Drozdov, who can vomit at will, is called on by McMahon to vomit in a bucket as a demonstration of his ability--an ability which earned him the ring name \\"Puke\\"--which McMahon plans to use as part of Drozdov's new in-ring persona. Drozdov becomes a WWF wrestler, but at the end of the film, it is revealed that Droz was paralyzed in an in-ring accident from a botched maneuver several months later. ==Production and release== Dwayne Johnson made his first film appearance in Beyond the Mat Blaustein decided to make a documentary about professional wrestling after being outed as a professional wrestling fan. His original budget was $500,000, funded by the company Imagine. He shot footage for the film over a span of three to five years. World Championship Wrestling refused to participate in the film. Blaustein approached the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) about involving the company in the film in 1997. WWF chairman Vince McMahon originally allowed Blaustein full access to behind-the-scenes aspects of his company, but later tried to pull out of the deal. Jake Roberts has stated that he was informed the film would be used to help children, but that never transpired. Blaustein has stated the opposite. In response to why he thought Roberts made the allegations, Blaustein responded, \\"I don't know why. Jake's looking for publicity for himself, maybe. I don't know. He has problems with reality. I wish Jake all the best.\\" Beyond the Mat was released in theaters in the United States in March 2000. The film was later released on DVD, including extra footage and cast interviews. An unrated director's cut edition dubbed Special Ringside Edition was released on DVD in March 2004. This version featured a new introduction and additional footage, as well as an interview with Foley and Jesse Ventura.Beyond the Mat: Unrated Director's Cut ‚Äì Ringside Special Edition ==ResponseCritics=== Beyond the Mat has an 82% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 66 reviews. Its consensus reads: \\"Even if you aren't a fan, Beyond the Mat provides a riveting, perceptive look into the world of professional wrestling by taking a closer look at the people beneath the personas.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated the film a B-, stating that \\"Beyond the Mat is entirely dependent on, and shaped by, the good stuff the director happens to get, rather than driven by hard questions a journalist might want answered.\\" Paul Tatara of CNN wrote, \\"Blaustein seems to think that he's humanizing these guys by showing how \\"normal\\" they are out of the ring, but he unintentionally makes their penchant for self-mutilation all the more inexplicable. There are a couple of laughs in the movie, but the overall effect is much more depressing than it is humorous.\\" The film was named Best Documentary at the Cinequest Film Festival, and was also nominated by the Director's Guild Association for best documentary and best director. The book The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen includes Beyond the Mat in its list, declaring that it \\"works on an almost Shakespearean level.\\" ===Wrestling industry=== After viewing the film, McMahon removed all advertising for it from WWF broadcasts. As a result, Lions Gate Films, the film's distributor, considered filing a lawsuit for restraint of trade. Spokespeople for the WWF, however, stated that advertising was pulled because of a policy against advertising for other wrestling companies or ventures. Blaustein also stated that McMahon ordered his wrestlers, including Mick Foley, not to speak about the film publicly. Foley, however, did appear on Larry King Live with Blaustein to help promote the film. As a result, the tagline of the movie became \\"The Movie Vince McMahon Didn't Want You to See!\\". Roddy Piper also appeared with Blaustein on Larry King Live to discuss the professional wrestling business. He called the movie, \\"the best documentary ever made on professional wrestling.\\" Likewise, Hulk Hogan expressed an interest in appearing in the next wrestling documentary should Blaustein make one. In June 2011, Blaustein undertook an extensive one-hour interview on Review a Wai with John Pollock, in which he discussed the problems of putting the documentary together with Vince McMahon's blessing. Blaustein also revealed that after the first viewing, it was Linda McMahon who was more upset than Vince, due to the documentary's portrayal of the company, and a lack of emphasis on the \\"fun\\" in professional wrestling. ===Fate of the wrestlers profiled=== In the years after the film was released, the three wrestlers primarily profiled continued their lives largely on the same path. Foley retired from full-time competition in 2000, at age 34, due to health concerns related to his hardcore style of wrestling, as well as him and his wife Colette (who was featured in the film with their two older children) having two more children after the film was released. He had, however, wrestled on occasion afterward. Foley was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2013, and maintains a relatively successful circuit of stand-up comedy and speaking tours. He is also a New York Times best-selling novelist. As the epilogue of the film mentioned, Funk's retirement lasted three months. Funk went on to participate in several more retirement matches, the most recent on September 22, 2017, at age 73. Along with his brother Dory Funk, Jr., Funk was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009. Roberts' drug and alcohol use increased after the film was released. In 2004, Roberts faced a charge of \\"causing unnecessary suffering\\" after his snake, \\"Damien\\", was allowed to starve to death in the garage of his London Colney home. In 2007, WWE initiated a policy to pay all expenses for any former WWWF/WWF/WWE performer who needed to enter into any form of drug rehabilitation. According to various wrestling news reports, as well as his own MySpace page, Roberts was placed in a 14-week voluntary rehab program by WWE as of December 10, 2007. In May 2008, Jim Ross reported that, \\"Jake Roberts has been doing well the past few weeks, after completing a treatment program.\\"http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article1001440.shtml Roberts continues to wrestle on the independent circuit, and in 2012 moved in with fellow wrestler Diamond Dallas Page to receive help with getting his life back on track. In 2013, Scott Hall joined Roberts' rehabilitative efforts by also moving into Page's home, which has been nicknamed the \\"accountability crib\\".WWE: 10 Wrestlers Who Like To Get High.HBO's 'Real Sports' visiting Diamond Dallas Page's 'Accountability Crib' This is documented in the film The Resurrection of Jake the Snake. At WrestleCon 2013, Roberts announced his desire to return to WWE as a participant in Royal Rumble 2014, which did not happen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzk22RC86f8 However, on January 6, 2014, Roberts returned on WWE television for the first time in almost nine years, as a part of Old School Raw at the end of the CM Punk vs Roman Reigns match, bringing out a new snake with him (an Albino Burmese Python) and aiding The New Age Outlaws and Punk in fending off The Shield.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbszVMpAh94 Jake is doing well and enjoying his new found sobriety, although he was diagnosed with skin cancer, for which he has undergone successful treatment.http://msn.foxsports.com/buzzer/story/report-jake-the-snake-roberts- faces-cancer-surgery-022414?ocid=twmsn He was announced as the second entrant of WWE's 2014 Hall of Fame Class.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1938854-jake-the-snake-to-be- inducted-into-2014-wwe-hall-of-fame-class#articles/1938854-jake-the-snake-to- be-inducted-into-2014-wwe-hall-of-fame-class In 2007, Jim Bell, the former Vice President of Merchandising for the WWF who featured in the film, was sentenced for trying to defraud the company almost $1 million dollars from 1998 to 2002 through illegitimate kickbacks. He received an eight month prison sentence and three years of probation. In 2014, Dennis Stamp published a book about his wrestling days titled The Stamp Collection: A Collection of Short Stories from the World's Most Famous Unknown Wrestler. That year he also refereed a main event for Scottish Wrestling Entertainment. In 2016, Stamp announced that his cancer had returned. He died of lymphoma on March 13, 2017 after which wrestlers including Ted DiBiase and Tommy Dreamer paid tribute to him on social media. In November 2017, Stamp was posthumously inducted into the Amarillo Pioneer Hall of Fame by the local Amarillo Pioneer newspaper. ==See also== * Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows, another very well-received professional wrestling documentary from around the same period. * Bloodstained Memoirs, a 2009 professional wrestling documentary. * The Wrestler * 1999 in film ==References* Category:1999 films Category:1999 documentary films Category:Professional wrestling documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Connecticut Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Nebraska Category:Films shot in New Hampshire Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania Category:Films shot in Texas Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer Category:Imagine Entertainment films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films directed by Barry W.

The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass. The pass is the only gap in the main Grampian Watershed suitable for road traffic routes for almost 100 km, between Glencoe (west) and Cairnwell (east); the West Highland Railway is the only other crossing, at Corrour. The pass is a natural low point, where the headwaters of the Spey and Tay penetrate most deeply into the broad Gaick Plateau, with the River Garry flowing south, and the River Truim north.

It is the high point on the A9, at 460 m (1508 ft), and in winter can be subject to severe weather conditions. There are routine winter patrols from November to March, and the road is occasionally closed with snow gates near Dalwhinnie and Dalnacardoch.

Completed in 1950, it travels north-south underneath the Houston Ship Channel. It was named after Harris County, Texas Auditor Harry L. Washburn. It is the largest and first toll-free vehicular tunnel in the Southern United States. ==Overview== The Merritt Chapman and Scott Corporation of New York built the $7 million project. First, a trench by had to be dug. Second, the sections had to be locked into position 85 feet underwater. Finally, the last touches, such as tiling the inside, were completed. It is the only underwater vehicle tunnel currently in operation in the state, as the Baytown Tunnel was replaced in 1995 by the Fred Hartman Bridge. The tunnel consists of a single bore, 895 meters (2,909 feet) in length, with a six-percent roadway grade outward from the center towards each exit. Forced transverse ventilation is potentially provided by three automatic high-speed Westinghouse Sturtevant blower fans located in a tower at the north entrance. These fans are designed to keep the air free from high-levels of carbon monoxide. In the event of electrical failure, a generator can support the electrical needs of the tunnel. Every twelfth light is powered by a generator. The light intensity at the portals is three times brighter than the interior. This prevents temporary blindness when entering the tunnel. Pumps located under the road surface counter accumulation of water by draining it back into the ship channel. Before Hurricane Ike in 2008, the tunnel had never been flooded. The tunnel is one of five vehicular crossings of the Ship Channel. The other four are the Sidney Sherman Bridge, popularly known as the (Interstate) 610 or Ship Channel bridge; the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, formerly the Jesse Jones Toll Bridge and popularly known as the Beltway 8 Bridge; the Fred Hartman Bridge connecting La Porte, Texas and Baytown, Texas; and the Lynchburg Ferry. The tunnel is also the only twenty-four-hour operation in Precinct Two. The tunnel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 2008. On March 1, 2020, operations of the Washburn Tunnel, along with the Lynchburg Ferry, were transferred from Harris County Precinct 2 to the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA).Toll Road Authority Takes Control Of Washburn Tunnel, Lynchburg Ferry Houston Public Media (KUHF-FM, News 88.7). 1 March 2020 (Retrieved 19 August 2020) There are no plans for HCTRA to implement tolls either the Washburn Tunnel or the Lynchburg Ferry. Nevertheless, HCTRA's involvement will include plans to improve the operations of both facilities, as well as much-needed repairs and upgrades. ==Specifications== Total Cost: $7,683,915 (1950) Total Length: 3,791 Ft.

Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir. Translated by Haq, S. M. (1967). Ibn Sa'ad's Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir Volume I Parts I & II. Delhi: Kitab Bhavan. the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from IsmƒÅ'ƒ´l and Ibrahim. His mother was a Jewish lady, Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). The Banu Najjar were a Jewish tribe, one of several that settled in Medina. Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born. He was given the name \\"Shaybah\\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-·∏§amd (\\"The white streak of praise\\"). After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaybah refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu·π≠·π≠alib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's slave, giving him the name 'Abd al-Muttalib (\\"slave of Muttalib\\"). ==Chieftain of Hashim clan== When Mu·π≠·π≠alib died, Shaybah succeeded him as the chief of the HƒÅshim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu·π≠·π≠alib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford University Press. 'Umar ibn Al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul- Mu·π≠·π≠alib and ·∏§arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib. Addressing ·∏§arb ibn Umayyah, he said: > Why do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; > more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; > whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in > lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good > qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are > renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you > are an asset to your tribe. ==Discovery of Zam Zam Well== 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the slaughter-place of the Quraysh between the two idols IsƒÅf and NƒÅ'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-·∏§ƒÅrith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul- Mu·π≠·π≠alib found traces of an old well and exclaimed, \\"Allahuakbar!\\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, but in the end they allowed him to keep it. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zamzam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred. ==The Year of the Elephant== According to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs ........ and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there. The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecationAbdulmalik ibn Hisham. Notes to Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press.) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca. There were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army and the year came to be known as 'ƒÄm al- Fƒ´l (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb replaced it with the Islamic Calendar. When news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, KinƒÅnah, KhuzƒÅ'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the ·∏§imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \\"Abdul- Mu·π≠·π≠alib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib left the meeting he was heard saying, \\"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\\" It is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (abƒÅbƒ´l) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way. This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter: Most Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the works of 'Abd al-Razzaq al- San'ani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father. ==Sacrificing his son Abdullah== Al-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well. When the Quraysh were trying to stop his digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib agreed to consult a \\"sorceress with a familiar spirit\\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared. ==Death== One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Medina, where her husband and his son, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their slave, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Mecca. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammaad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81. ==FamilyWives=== Abdul-Muttalib had six known wives. *Sumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe. *LubnƒÅ bint HƒÅjar of the Khuza'a tribe. *Fatimah bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe. *Halah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe. *Natƒ´la bint Janab of the Namir tribe. *Mumanna'a bint 'Amr of the Khuza'a tribe. ===Children=== According to Ibn Hisham, 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib had ten sons and six daughters. However, Ibn Saad lists twelve sons. By Sumrah bint Jandab: #Al-·∏§ƒÅrith ibn 'Abdul-Mu·π≠·π≠alib. He was the firstborn and he died before his father. #Quthum. He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.

He founded and served as president of Byron Preiss Visual Publications, and later of ibooks Inc. ==BiographyEarly life and career=== A native of Brooklyn, New York City, Byron Preiss graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972, and earned a master's degree in communications from Stanford University. In 1971, while Preiss was teaching at a Philadelphia elementary school, he conceived, and with Jim Steranko, produced an anti-drug comic book, The Block, designed for low-level reading skills. Published by Steranko's company, Supergraphics, it was distributed to schools nationwide. Additional , June 20, 2011. He founded Byron Preiss Visual Publications in 1974 to publish original works, including Weird Heroes (1975). His 1976 Fiction Illustrated series of illustrated novels began with Schlomo Raven: Public Detective, a Preiss collaboration with Tom Sutton, followed by Starfawn, illustrated by Stephen Fabian, Steranko's Chandler: Red Tide and the 1977 Son of Sherlock Holmes, illustrated by Ralph Reese. Other publications included a 1978 adaptation of Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination as a two-volume graphic novel, illustrated by Howard Chaykin. ===Publishing career=== As a book packager, he developed titles for such publishers as HarperCollins and Random House. One such project, created in conjunction with the Bank Street College of Education, resulted in a series of educational comic books adapting well-known genre authors: The Bank Street Book of Creepy Tales, The Bank Street Book of Fantasy, The Bank Street Book of Mystery and The Bank Street Book of Science Fiction. He published children's books by celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Jane Goodall, Jay Leno, LeAnn Rimes and Jerry Seinfeld, and worked closely with such established illustrators as Ralph Reese, William Stout and Tom Sutton. Preiss was co- author, with Michael Reaves, of the children's novel Dragonworld (Doubleday, 1979), with 80 illustrations by Joseph Zucker. Dragonworld was originally planned to be the fifth \\"Fiction Illustrated\\" title. In 1982, Preiss published The Secret, a puzzle book that combined 12 short verses and 12 elaborate fantasy paintings by John Jude Palencar. Readers were expected to pair each painting with a verse in a way that would provide clues to finding one of 12 plexiglass boxes buried in various parks around North America. Each box contained a ceramic box that contained a key that could be redeemed for a jewel worth $1,000. The book was inspired by the success of Masquerade, written and illustrated by Kit Williams and published in England in August 1979, but The Secret never led to the same level of treasure hunting frenzy. One of the ceramic boxes was found in Chicago in 1983, one in Cleveland in 2004, and one in Boston in October 2019.Hidden treasure, a family's quest, and \\"The Secret\\" The remaining nine boxes have yet to be found, and reportedly Preiss was the only one who knew where they were when he died. Beyond traditional printed books, Preiss frequently embraced emerging technologies, and was among the first to publish in such electronic forms as CD-ROM books and ebooks. The Words of Gandhi, an audiobook he produced, won a Grammy Award in 1985. ===Later life and death=== Preiss was married to Sandi Mendelson, with whom he had daughters Karah and Blaire. On July 9, 2005, he died in a traffic accident at East Hampton, New York, on Long Island. Both Byron Preiss Visual Publications and ibooks Inc. filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on February 22, 2006, after his death. ==List of Byron Preiss publications== Published by Preiss, or packaged by Preiss for other publishers *The Electric Company Joke Book (1973) *The Silent e's from Outer Space (Western Pub., 1973; Goldencraft, 1974 ) *One Year Affair (1976) *Weird Heroes (Pyramid Books, 1975‚Äì77) ::Vol. 1 () to Vol. 8 (); collections of illustrated, pulp-inspired stories *Fiction Illustrated #1 ‚Äì Schlomo Raven: Public Detective (Pyramid Books, 1976; by Preiss and Tom Sutton) *Fiction Illustrated #2 ‚Äì Starfawn (Pyramid Books, 1976; by Preiss and Stephen Fabian) *Fiction Illustrated #3 ‚Äì Chandler: Red Tide (Pyramid Books, 1976 ; Dark Horse, 2001 ) *Fiction Illustrated #4 ‚Äì Son of Sherlock Holmes (Pyramid Books, 1977; by Preiss and Ralph Reese) *Empire (1978) by Samuel R.

Basic training centers for recruits are called \\"secondary police schools\\" and every law enforcement officer must advance through one of these centers. In this system, \\"senior police schools\\" still exist that have the educational status of \\"higher learning\\", where specialisations are offered. Municipal police may have access to several training centers, and some larger cities have their own dedicated campuses. Some municipalities conduct training through privately licensed agencies. ===Estonia=== The Estonia Police was originally established in 1918 and then re-established in 1991 after regaining independence from the Soviet Union.

After the Bachelor's degree and three additional years of experience in the field of internal security, an officer is qualified to apply for Master's studies (2 years, Master's degree). Master's studies focus on management skills and supervisory tasks. The Master's degree is a required qualification for command positions such as Chief Inspector or Superintendent. ===Indonesia=== Indonesian Police Academy Indonesian Police Academy Cadets In Indonesia, the National Police Academy (Indonesian: Akademi Kepolisian abbreviated \\"AKPOL\\") is the main institute, training center, and school for recruits joining the Indonesian National Police Force to become professional officers. After 4 years in the Police Academy, cadets graduate to the rank of Police Inspector 2nd Class (Inspektur Polisi Dua), (equivalent to Second Lieutenant in the military). Graduates become first line supervisors with the rank of junior first ranking officers in the Indonesian National Police and can be deployed to different units within the force. The academy is located in Semarang, Central Java and is part of the International Association of Police Academies (Interpa). Cadet ranks in the Academy are as shown below: *Cadet Enlisted Candidate (Calon Bhayangkara Taruna) - Trainee for the first 4 months *Cadet Enlisted Second Class (Bhayangkara Dua Taruna) - First Year *Cadet Enlisted First Class (Bhayangkara Satu Taruna) - Second Year *Cadet Brigadier Second Class (Brigadir Dua Taruna) - Third Year *Cadet Brigadier First Class (Brigadir Satu Taruna) - Fourth Year *Cadet Brigadier (Brigadir Taruna) - Graduating year (After this rank, they will graduate and achieve the rank of \\"Police Inspector\\") Until 1999, before the Indonesian National Police officially separated from the armed forces (ABRI), the Indonesian Police Academy (\\"AKPOL\\") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia, and controlled by the National Police Headquarters (Mabes Polri). Although separated from the service academies, cadets from both institutions maintain cooperative relationships through annual joint exercises. AKPOL's new cadets and 4th class cadets, alongside their armed forces counterparts, have had a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the police officer cadets spend the remaining 4 years of study in Semarang. ===India=== Located in Hyderabad, India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy is the national institute for training of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers before they are assigned to their respective Indian state cadres.

Centers for Training Border Police Personnel are in Ia»ôi and Orsova. ===Serbia=== In Serbia, future police officers are trained at the Basic Police Training Centre in Sremska Kamenica, the former Police High School. The training lasts for 1 year and is followed by a 6-month probation period at a Regional Police Department. The skills the recruits learn are for general jurisdiction police officers, and after they are employed, they may specialise in a line of work (traffic police, border police, special forces, etc.). There is also the Academy of Criminalistic and Police Studies, a higher education institution established as a legal successor of the Advanced School of Internal Affairs, formed in 1972; and Police Academy, formed in 1993. ===Slovak Republic=== In the Slovak Republic, the Police College, (University), offers courses in security specialization for police, public administration, and private security services. Some branches are open to civilians, while some only allow police officers, firefighters, soldiers and the like. The schools offer Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and Doctoral Degrees.

Advanced police school courses last two years, and require one to have been a police officer for at least two years. ===Spain=== In Spain, there is a Ministry of the Interior's National Police centralised academy near √Åvila (.) The Guardia Civil runs two centralised academies, one for enlisted guardias and sub- officers in Baeza (Ja√©n, ) and another one for commanding officers in two campuses at Aranjuez () and El Escorial () (Madrid). The autonomous Catalan and Basque police forces ‚Äîthe Mossos d'Esquadra and the Ertzaintza‚Äî also have their own academies in Mollet del Vall√®s (Barcelona, ) and Arcaute (√Ålava, ). No candidates with a criminal record are accepted. Candidates attend these centralised public academies after passing the police force's entry examination, this way recruits are already enlisted and will automatically become police officers if they don't fail the course or drop out. Recruits' training is tuition free and the candidates are paid a police cadet's wage as members of the force. Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level polic√≠a Nacional or Guardia civil to 9 months for a mosso, but realistically takes 18 months to two years including practicums and additional training. Local police forces including Madrid's or Barcelona's are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialised courses are longer and eventually lead to a college-like degree. The Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private academias training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand. While these private academies may be helpful, studying at them is not required and potential candidates are able to take the entrance examination without these courses. ===Sri Lanka=== Sri Lanka established the Sri Lanka Police Academy in 2008, bringing together several police training institutions including the Sri Lanka Police College. ===Sweden=== Since 2015, police training has been entirely outsourced by the Swedish Police Authority, and is carried out at three universities: V√§xj√∂, Ume√•, and S√∂dert√∂rn. The training covers five terms, and the last two include six months of paid workplace practicum as a Police Trainee. Applicants must possess eligibility for higher education, the personal qualities deemed necessary for the profession and meet a number of the physical requirements relating to the job. ===Turkey=== The Police Academy was established in 1937 to recruit police chiefs. In 1938, a police college, (high school), was established in Ankara in order to prepare students for the Police Academy. Today, the police academy recruits police officers in 26 schools located in different parts of Turkey, and police chiefs in one school located in Ankara. ===United Arab Emirates=== In UAE, the Emirates either train their own police force or outsource training to academies of other Emirates. There are mainly two academies, one located in Abu Dhabi and the other in Dubai. Abu Dhabi In the Abu Dhabi Police Academy, the study program includes practical and field training. After successful completion of the program, the student is awarded a bachelor's degree in Law and Policing Sciences. An Institute for officer training affiliated with the Police College was established in 1992. In 2002, the system of study in the college was changed to incorporate training theory programs and fieldwork. The four years of study are divided into two levels of study consisting of eight terms: =Basic level ‚Äì two years= One year for theoretical study and another for fieldwork. =Advanced level ‚Äì two years= These two levels are preceded by an introductory period for the physical and psychological preparation of the students. After successful completion of the study and training programs, the student will be awarded a bachelor's degree in Police Sciences and Criminal Justice. Dubai The Dubai Police Academy was founded in 1987 and was granted autonomy from the police force as long as it retained some affiliation with Dubai Police General Headquarters. It was fully inaugurated in 1989 in the presence of Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. In 1992, degrees offered by the academy were given university equivalency. The first class was from 1987 to 1988 and consisted of 51 cadets and 30 full-time students, (some of whom were existing police officers), which graduated in 1991. During the academic year of 1996‚Äì1997, students from other Arabic countries such as Yemen and the Palestinian Territories were admitted. ===United Kingdom=== England and Wales All candidates for the 43 police forces for England and Wales must be over the age of 18¬Ω; of a reasonable standard of physical fitness, with good health and eyesight. Candidates also must hold British citizenship, be a citizen of the Commonwealth with no restrictions on his or her stay within Britain or be a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. All candidates serve two years as probationary constables, which will be spent training in both academic and practical situations. From 2007, all training was managed by the now defunct National Policing Improvement Agency with the College of Policing taking over in 2013. Scotland All new police officers in Scotland attend an initial 11-week training course at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan Castle. The college has been operating since 1954 and hosts initial training of new officers as well as a range of courses such as the training of traffic officers and detectives. Many courses have received accreditation from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) or are credit rated on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Training ranges from a SCQF Level 7 for the probationer training delivered to new recruits (equivalent to an entry level higher education course) to degree level qualifications for more specialised or senior roles such as detective training or courses for senior officers. ===United States=== A police training vehicle with extended front and rear push bars Police academies exist in every state and also at the federal level. Each state has an agency that certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification. In an analysis of training requirements in several states by Gawker \\"found Louisiana law enforcement recruits typically attend 360 hours of training, while the national average is slightly more than 600 hours. Louisiana requires less hours of training for law enforcement than the 1,500 hours needed to become a certified barber, the website said. Washington, D.C., requires the most police academy training hours in the nation, at 1,120.\\" Federal While some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Marshals Service), require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC). FLETC, which is operated by the Department of Homeland Security, and is headquartered in Glynco, Georgia with training sites in Artesia, New Mexico, Charleston, South Carolina and Cheltenham, Maryland. Connecticut In Connecticut, police officer recruits receive a certification to enforce the General Statutes. Their training is conducted at \\"The Connecticut Police Academy\\" located at 285 Preston Avenue, in Meriden, CT. In order to become a certified police officer, a recruit must be a legal United States resident at least 21 years of age, have a high school diploma or equivalent, possess a valid drivers license, and not be convicted of any felonies. The to be officers then have to attend an 818-hour basic training course that covers various aspects of police work.http://www.ct.gov/post/lib/post/pdf_documents/818_basic_training_curriculum_jan_09.pdf This basic training course is certified by Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, (CALEA). Florida In Florida, police academies are primarily run by community colleges or state agencies. All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission under the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified. Kentucky All law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS) prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer. Larger agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police, as well as the Louisville Metro Police and the Lexington Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 20-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and located on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond. Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the Kentucky Constitution. These include sheriffs, constables, coroners and jailers, (though generally not deputies). Many of these officeholders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office. Maryland In Maryland, the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major law enforcement agencies operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, defensive tactics, report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of First Responder, and a 40-hour block of weapon training. Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the Maryland State Police requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.Recruiting.mdsp.org Many colleges such as the University of Maryland and other community colleges offer police academy instruction as well.Outlook.umd.edu Michigan In Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of community colleges, city or county police and sheriff departments, or the Michigan State Police. After the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity. New Hampshire New Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law. The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph, and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification. Most agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires. Texas The agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the Texas Department of Public Safety which trains state troopers, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department who train game wardens, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice that trains state corrections officers. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers). Utah The basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures. ===Vietnam=== Located in Tu Liem district, Hanoi, Vietnam, The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the Vietnam People's Public Security, training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees. The People's Police Academy is a training center under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security.

His disappearance helped launch the missing children movement, which included new legislation and new methods for tracking down missing children. Several years after he disappeared, Patz was one of the first children to be profiled on the \\"photo on a milk carton\\" campaigns of the early 1980s. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan designated May 25‚Äîthe anniversary of Etan's disappearance‚Äîas National Missing Children's Day in the United States. Decades later, it was determined that Patz had been abducted and murdered the same day that he went missing. The case was reopened in 2010 by the Manhattan District Attorney's office. In 2012, the FBI excavated the basement of the alleged crime scene near the Patz residence but discovered no new evidence. Pedro Hernandez‚Äîa suspect who confessed‚Äîwas charged and indicted later that year on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. In 2014, the case went through a series of hearings to determine whether or not Hernandez's statements before he received his Miranda rights were legally admissible at trial. His trial began in January 2015 and it ended with a mistrial that May, when one of the 12 jurors held out. The retrial began on October 19, 2016, and it was concluded on February 14, 2017, after nine days of deliberations, when the jury found Hernandez guilty of murder and kidnapping. Hernandez was sentenced to 25-years-to-life in prison on April 18, 2017. Hernandez will not be eligible for parole for 25 years. ==Disappearance== On the morning of May 25, 1979, Etan left his SoHo apartment at 113 Prince Street by himself for the first time, planning to walk two blocks to board a school bus at West Broadway and Prince Street. He was wearing a black \\"Future Flight Captain\\" pilot cap, a blue corduroy jacket, blue jeans and blue sneakers with fluorescent stripes. He never got on the bus. At school, Etan's teacher noticed his absence but did not report it to the principal. When Etan did not return home after school, his mother Julie called the police. At first, detectives considered the Patzes to be possible suspects but quickly determined they had no involvement. An intense search began that evening, using nearly 100 police officers and a team of bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks. Neighbors and police canvassed the city and placed missing-child posters featuring Etan's portrait, but this resulted in few leads. Etan's father Stanley was a professional photographer and had a collection of photographs he had taken of his son. His photos of Etan were printed on countless missing-child posters and milk cartons. They were also projected on screens in Times Square. ==Accusations against Jose Ramos== Assistant United States Attorney Stuart R. GraBois received the case in 1985 and identified Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child sexual abuser who had been a friend of Etan's former babysitters, as the primary suspect. In 1982, multiple boys had accused Ramos of trying to lure them into a drain pipe in the area where Ramos was living. When police searched the drain pipe, they found photographs of Ramos and young boys who resembled Etan. GraBois eventually found out that Ramos had been in custody in Pennsylvania in connection with an unrelated child molestation case. In 1990, GraBois was deputized as a deputy state attorney general in Pennsylvania to help prosecute a case against Ramos for sexually abusing children and to obtain further information about Etan's case. When first questioned by GraBois, Ramos stated that, on the day when Etan disappeared, he had taken a young boy back to his apartment to rape him. Ramos said that he was \\"90 percent sure\\" it was the boy whom he later saw on television. However, Ramos did not use Etan's name. He also claimed he had \\"put the boy on a subway\\". In 1991, while Ramos was incarcerated, a jailhouse informant told GraBois and FBI agent Mary Galligan that Ramos had told him he knew what had happened to Etan. Ramos even drew a map of Etan's school bus route, indicating that he knew that Etan's bus stop was the third one on the route. In a special feature on missing children, the New York Post reported on October 21, 1999, that Ramos was the prime suspect in Etan's disappearance. \\"Investigators now believe a pedophile in prison in Pennsylvania for abusing two children there is the prime suspect in Patz's disappearance, but he has never been charged in the New York case.\\" Accessed via LexisNexis. Ramos had been known by the Patz family and was the prime suspect all along, but in the early 1980s authorities were unable to prosecute Ramos. Etan's body was never found; he was declared legally dead in 2001. Stan and Julie Patz pursued and won a civil case against Ramos in 2004. They were awarded a symbolic sum of $2 million, which they have never collected. Ramos has never been criminally prosecuted for the murder of Etan. Every year, on Etan's birthday and the anniversary of his disappearance, Stan Patz sent Ramos a copy of his son's missing-child poster. On the back, he typed the same message: \\"What did you do to my little boy?\\" Ramos has denied that he killed Etan. He served a 20-year prison sentence in the State Correctional Institution in Dallas, Pennsylvania, for child molestation. He was released from prison on November 7, 2012. Soon after his release he was arrested on a Megan's Law violation. Stan and Julie Patz had the 2004 judgment against Ramos dismissed after the 2015 trial of Pedro Hernandez convinced them that Ramos was not responsible for their son's death. ==Case reopened== Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. officially reopened the case on May 25, 2010. On April 19, 2012, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and New York City Police Department (NYPD) investigators began excavating the SoHo basement of 127-B Prince Street, near the Patz home. This residence had been newly refurbished shortly after Etan's disappearance in 1979, and the basement had been the workshop and storage space of a handyman. After a four-day search, investigators announced that there was \\"nothing conclusive found.\\" ===Confession=== On May 24, 2012, New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced that a man was in custody who had implicated himself in Etan's disappearance. According to The New York Times, a law enforcement official identified the man as 51-year-old Pedro Hernandez of Maple Shade, New Jersey, and said that he had confessed to strangling the child. He stated in his written confession to police, \\"I‚Äôm sorry, I shoke [sic] him.\\" According to a 2009 book about the case, After Etan, Etan had a dollar and had told his parents he planned to buy a soda to drink with his lunch. At the time of Etan's disappearance, Hernandez was an 18-year-old convenience store worker in a neighborhood bodega. Hernandez said that he later threw Etan's remains into the garbage. Hernandez was charged with second-degree murder. According to a New York Times report from May 25, 2012, the police at that time had no physical evidence to corroborate his confession. ===Corroborating evidence=== In 2012 a man from New Jersey, Jose Lopez, reached out to investigators: He believed that Hernandez, Lopez's brother-in-law, was in fact responsible for Etan's disappearance. Statements by Hernandez's sister, Nina Hernandez, and Tomas Rivera, leader of a Charismatic Christianity group at St. Anthony of Padua, a Roman Catholic church in Camden, New Jersey, indicated that Hernandez may have publicly confessed in the presence of fellow parishioners in the early 1980s to murdering Etan. According to Hernandez's sister, it was an \\"open family secret that he had confessed in the church.\\" A New York grand jury indicted Hernandez on November 14, 2012, on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping. His lawyer has stated that Hernandez was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which includes hallucinations. The lawyer has also said his client has a low intelligence quotient (IQ) of around 70, \\"at the border of intellectual disability.\\" ===Trials and conviction=== On December 12, 2012, Hernandez pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping in a New York court. In April 2013, Harvey Fishbein, Hernandez's legal aid criminal defense lawyer, filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing that Hernandez's \\"confession in one of the nation's most notorious child disappearances was false, peppered with questionable claims and made after almost seven hours of police questioning\\". The next month, however, New York Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley ruled that the evidence was \\"legally sufficient to support the charges\\" and that the case could move forward. He also ordered a hearing to determine whether the defendant's statements could be used at trial. Hernandez had a hearing in September 2014 about whether his statements made prior to police giving him his Miranda rights were legally admissible at trial. This would be influenced by whether or not he felt free to leave during the time before he was informed of his Miranda rights. The hearing was also to determine whether or not he understood the significance of the Miranda rights and was competent to waive them when he did so. This was significant because it would decide whether any statements made after that point by Hernandez were legally admissible at trial. The actual truth or falsehood of the statements was not the focus of the hearing; rather, the question of the statements' truthfulness was to be discussed in the trial, which began on January 5, 2015. The case resulted in a mistrial in May 2015 due to a hung jury, which was deadlocked 11 against 1 for conviction. A retrial began on October 19, 2016, in a New York City court, with jury deliberations in February 2017. On February 14, 2017, Hernandez was found guilty of kidnapping and felony murder. Sentencing was scheduled on February 28, with Hernandez facing up to 25 years to life in prison. However, Hernandez's attorneys were granted a delay so as to be able to challenge the verdict, and no new sentencing date was set. On April 18, 2017, Hernandez was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after serving at least 25 years. ==Aftermath== In 1983, the May 25 anniversary of Etan Patz's disappearance was designated National Missing Children's Day in the United States.\\"May 25 ‚Äì International Missing Children's Day\\", Help Bring Them Home\\"National Missing Children's Day\\", Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention In 2001, the tribute spread worldwide.\\"International Missing Childrens Day May 25, 2014\\", An Garda S√≠och√°na, May 25, 2014 The International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) coordinates the \\"Help Bring Them Home\\" campaign in 22 countries in conjunction with International Missing Children's Day.\\"Missing Children Day May 25, 2011\\", YouTube (video), DontYouForgetAboutMe\\" Countries around the world honor International Missing Children's Day on May 25\\" , ICMEC The extensive media attention given to Etan's disappearance has been credited with creating greater attention to missing children, resulting in changes such as less willingness to allow children to walk to school, photos of missing children being printed on milk cartons, and promotion of the concept of \\"stranger danger\\", the idea that all adults not known to the child must be regarded as potential sources of danger. ==See also== *Crime in New York City *List of murder convictions without a body *List of people who disappeared ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * *Help Us Find Them - National Missing Children's Day 2015 * Category:Missing person cases in New York (state) Category:1979 in New York City Category:1970s missing person cases Category:May 1979 events in the United States Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:Murder convictions without a body Category:Violence against children ","title":"Disappearance of Etan Patz"},{"id":"2209451","text":"Jules Louis Gabriel Violle (16 November 1841 ‚Äì 12 September 1923) was a French physicist and inventor.

He earned a Super Bowl ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks. ==Professional careerPittsburgh Steelers=== He was drafted with the sixth pick of the second round of the 2004 NFL Draft out of Tusculum College. He is perhaps best known for his momentum-shifting muffed punt in week three of the 2006 season. With the Steelers up 17 to 14 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Colclough was back for a punt with roughly eight minutes remaining. He attempted to field the punt by raising his hands above his head, then dropping the punt. He and teammate free safety Tyrone Carter both had a chance to recover, but both failed. One play after the miscue, Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer hit wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh for a score. The Steelers ended up losing the game, 28-20.

Lennon also said, \\"I think it's a revolutionary song ‚Äì it's really just revolutionary. I just think its concept is revolutionary. I hope it's for workers and not for tarts and fags. I hope it's about what Give Peace a Chance was about. But I don't know ‚Äì on the other hand, it might just be ignored. I think it's for the people like me who are working class, who are supposed to be processed into the middle classes, or into the machinery. It's my experience, and I hope it's just a warning to people, Working Class Hero.\\" The refrain of the song is \\"A working class hero is something to be\\". The song is not Lennon's first political song. His string of political songs began in 1968 with the Beatles' \\"Revolution\\" and further continued in 1972 with the release of Some Time in New York City. ==Recording and sound== Recorded at EMI Studios on 27 September 1970, the song features only Lennon, singing and playing an acoustic guitar as his backing. The chord progression is very simple, and builds on A-minor and G-major, with a short detour to D-major in one line of the chorus. Lennon's strumming technique includes a riff with a hammer-on pick of the E note on the D string and then an open A string. The tone and style of the song is similar to that of \\"Masters of War\\" and \\"North Country Blues\\" by Bob Dylan, a known influence of Lennon. Both are based on Jean Ritchie's arrangement of the traditional English folk song, \\"Nottamun Town\\". Lennon recorded \\"Working Class Hero\\" over a hundred times until he was satisfied with the recording. The recording is the composite of two different takes: the tone of the guitar and vocal changes between 1:24 and 1:45 for the verse \\"When they've tortured and scared you\\". ==Personnel== * John Lennon ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar ==Controversy== In 1973, US Representative Harley Orrin Staggers heard the song ‚Äì which includes the lines \\"'Til you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules\\" and \\"But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see\\" ‚Äì on WGTB and lodged a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The manager of the station, Ken Sleeman, faced a year in prison and a $10,000 fine, but defended his decision to play the song saying, \\"The People of Washington DC are sophisticated enough to accept the occasional four-letter word in context, and not become sexually aroused, offended, or upset.\\" The charges were dropped. Other US radio stations, like Boston's WBCN, banned the song for its use of the word \\"fucking\\". In Australia, the album was released with the expletive removed from the song and the lyrics censored on the inner sleeve. ==Notable covers== *Marianne Faithfull covered the song on her 1979 album Broken English. *David Bowie's band Tin Machine recorded a version of the song on their 1989 self- titled debut album. *Marilyn Manson's cover of the song was released on his Disposable Teens single of 2000. *Green Day contributed a cover of the song to the Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur in 2007. * The similarly titled single by Tommy Roe (#79 Canada June 1973/#29 AC) is not the same song. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1970 songs Category:2007 songs Category:1971 singles Category:2007 singles Category:1970s ballads Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs critical of religion Category:Obscenity controversies in music Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:Song recordings produced by Phil Spector Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon Category:Song recordings produced by Yoko Ono Category:Manic Street Preachers songs Category:Folk ballads Category:Songs against capitalism ","title":"Working Class Hero"},{"id":"2209466","text":"Prague 1, formally the Prague 1 Municipal District (Mƒõstsk√° ƒç√°st Praha 1), is a second-tier municipality in Prague.

As a community, Llandinam is made up of the village itself, small hamlets including Plas Dinam and Little London and several farms. The village itself has a population of around 576 with 56% born in Wales.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000276 Llandinam was the family home of David Davies who was responsible for much of the development of the South Wales Valleys and the export of coal in the 19th century. The house that David Davies built, Broneirion, remains an elegant country mansion owned by Girlguiding Cymru. The parents of Murray Humphreys, one of Chicago's most feared Prohibition gangsters, emigrated to the United States from the village in the late 1890s. The bridge from the main road over towards Broneirion was the first cast iron bridge constructed in the county, designed by Thomas Penson and built by Davies 1846. It spans 90 feet (27.5 m). At the east end of the bridge there is a statue of David Davies.Cragg, Roger (ed):Civil Engineering Heritage, Wales and West Central England, Gordonstoun school was evacuated here for the duration of World War II. The local village school was threatened with closure in 2003 due to falling pupil numbers; thanks to a popular local campaign it was temporarily saved. Llandinam was voted the Best Kept Village in Wales in 1986. Previously served by Llandinam railway station on the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway. ==Governance== An electoral ward in the same name exists, which also covers the neighbouring community of Mochdre. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 1,405. It elected its first Conservative County Councillor in May 2017. Statue of David Davies ==St Llonio's Church== St Llonio's Church is located immediately north of the village centre, on a spur jutting into the Severn Valley, and within a fortified promontory fort, the defensive bank forming, until recently, the northern boundary of the church. It was originally the mother church of those at Llanidloes and Llanwnnog, serving a monastery until the late 13th century. It is claimed that the church dates back to AD 520. It was initially a clas structure, with its western tower containing a pyramidal slate roof over a timber belfry, dating from the 13th century. It is recorded as Ecclesia de Landinam in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 with a value of ¬£1 6s 8d. The majority of the church was rebuilt in the 19th century, coinciding with the restoration by George Edmund Street. The church still retains some original features, however, most notably the northern wall of the chancel. The church has a wooden reredos, two old tomb recesses in the sanctuary, a damaged perpendicular font and a number of 17th-century carved choir stalls. The square western tower probably dates from the 13th century with its timber belfry designed in Marches style. Rebuilding culminated in 1864-65 and left only the north wall of the chancel remaining from the previous design. During the restoration, new windows in square headed frames were inserted throughout the church and all the windows were replaced in neo-Gothic style. In the centre of the burial ground, to the south-west of the church, is an ancient yew tree claimed to be around 800 years old. South-west of the yew is a large oak tree. There is another large yew to the north-west of the churchyard several Irish yews on the west side. The church, which is a Grade II listed building lies in the Church in Wales parish of Bro Arwystli. It has its own Facebook page, which features photographs of some of its unique architectural features. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Photos of Llandinam and surrounding area on geograph.org *Llandinam Village website Category:Historic Montgomeryshire Parishes Category:Villages in Powys Category:Populated places on the River Severn Category:Wards of Powys ","title":"Llandinam"},{"id":"2209470","text":"Antonia Zerbisias (born in Montreal, Quebec)\\"In Your Face\\" , The Ryerson Review of Journalism (Spring 2006) is a Canadian journalist associated with the Toronto Star from 1989 until she took early retirement from the paper on 31 October 2014. She has been a reporter and TV host for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as well as the Montreal correspondent for the trade paper, Variety. She was nominated for ACTRA awards for her documentary writing in 1980 and 1981, and won the 1996 National Newspaper Award for critical writing for her columns about magazines. Currently a freelancer, she regularly writes opinion columns for Al Jazeera English and the Toronto alternative weekly, Now. ==Early life== Petros Zerbisias immigrated from Greece to Canada arriving in Halifax in 1928. He settled in Montreal where he met his wife, Loula, where they owned and operated the Deli-Q restaurant. Zerbisias attended Wagar High School in the suburb of Cote-St-Luc. She was married to the late Mark Blandford, a prominent Quebec television producer, director and screenwriter. ==Career== Zerbisias has a BA in applied social sciences from Concordia University (then called Sir George Williams University). Her first job as a reporter, in the early 1970s, was with the now-defunct Montreal weekly newspaper the Sunday Express. She moved to Toronto and worked as a researcher on the Larry Solway Show for a year before returning to Montreal in 1975. In 1975, she joined CBC-TV, first as a researcher and eventually becoming a reporter for The City at Six which later was renamed Newswatch. In 1980 she returned to Concordia to earn her MBA (Marketing Research, Honours, 1985), while still working as a journalist for CBC-TV and Variety. In 1986, she became a reporter/producer for the CBC-TV business show Venture. In 2002-2003, she co-hosted the CBC Newsworld program Inside Media with Matthew Fraser.Insidemedia 2002‚Äî2003 Season. CBC. ===Toronto Star=== Zerbisias joined the Toronto Star as a TV columnist in 1989. She was assigned to the Montreal bureau in 1991. In 1993, she returned to Toronto and became a media critic. She won the 1996 National Newspaper Award for critical writing for her columns about magazines; the award noting that Zerbisias \\"is not one to mince with words as she focuses on the subject matter at hand. She proceeds to give us her insights, analysis and critique not only with rhetorical, stylistic and intellectual rigor, but with gusto and passion, a rare commodity in today's bland politically correct journalism.\\" In 1997, she became TV critic and then, in 2003, was appointed media columnist. Zerbisias' first blog for the Star, Azerbic effectively went on hiatus in August 2006 and ceased publishing the following December. She continued as media critic until June 2007, when she became the social issues and cultural affairs columnist at the Toronto Star. In January 2008, she launched a new Star blog, with a focus on feminist issues, called Broadsides . In April 2010, she ended her regular column to become a feature writer at the Toronto Star. She took early retirement from the Star on 31 October 2014. === Social Media === On the day before retiring from The Star, during the controversy over allegations that CBC Radio personality Jian Ghomeshi had assaulted half a dozen women, Zerbisias, along with then-Montreal Gazette reporter Sue Montgomery, created the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported which went viral internationally and was translated into other languages. === Disputes === While focusing on entertainment, media and cultural issues for the bulk of her career Zerbisias has also taken positions in regards to the Middle East including the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and the Iraq War. In 2009, on Twitter, she took issue with former Justice Minister Irwin Cotler who, as a keynote speaker at a Stand With Us event at Israel's Bar-Ilan University, boasted about his children enlisting in the Israeli military and asked \\"Which country are you loyal to, sir?\\"Israel on the brain, by Jonathan Kay, National Post, 22 September 2009. In the same year, she mocked Bernie Farber, then CEO of the Canadian Jewish Congress, in her blog for wearing a \\"Nobody knows I'm gay\\" T-shirt while marching in Toronto's Pride parade in a protest against the inclusion of Queers Against Israeli Apartheid in the march after he had said that political groups do not belong in the Pride parade.\\"Bernie Farber is not gay\\" by Corvin Russell, Canadian Dimension, 12 July 2009 Zerbisias commented on Farber's decision to march as itself being a political act by sardonically writing in the comments thread of her blog, \\"Imagine my surprise when I saw Bernie Farber identifying himself as queer by joining a pro-Israel gay rights group in the parade.\\" The Canadian Jewish Congress responded by filing a complaint with the Toronto Star against Zerbisias for allegedly \\"outing\\" Farber.\\"I‚Äôd like to reply to that Editor‚Äôs Note\\", Mark Steyn, Maclean's Magazine, 6 May 2010 The Star's public editor, Kathy English, ruled that Zerbisias' comments \\"fell short of the Star's standards of fairness, accuracy and civility,\\" and promised to rein in journalists who \\"put the Star in a negative light.\\" Readers lamented the Toronto Star's sudden lack of humour and appreciation for one of its own columnists. \\"Imagine if top-notch cartoonist Theo Moudakis had penned a cartoon expressing the same thing. Would the Star have griped? I think not,\\" suggested a Star reader. English acknowledged that her ruling had elicited widespread criticism and subsequently modified her assessment and criticized Farber and the Canadian Jewish Congress since in their complaint they did not \\"think to tell me that [Farber], along with dozens of others who marched with the Kulanu group, had worn a T-shirt that made its own ironic quip. That's context I sure wish I had known\\" and conceded that Zerbisias' comment \\"was intended as sarcastic irony, stock in trade for this columnist and blogger. But I think her attempt at irony failed here; the quip ‚Äì as published without that context ‚Äì was ambiguous and could be misunderstood\\", adding \\"To be fair to Zerbisias, it should be made clear, though, that she did not 'make things up,' as Farber interpreted it.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *Zerbisias' columns in the Toronto Star *Azerbic - Zerbisias' former blog page at the Toronto Star *\\"In Your Face\\", The Ryerson Review of Journalism (Spring 2006) *Broadsides - Zerbisias' new blog page at the Toronto Star *Antonia Zerbisias interview - Thursday, 9 October 2008 Category:Canadian columnists Category:Canadian people of Greek descent Category:Canadian women journalists Category:Journalists from Montreal Category:Writers from Montreal Category:Living people Category:Toronto Star people Category:Women columnists Category:Canadian women non-fiction writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Antonia Zerbisias"},{"id":"2209480","text":"The 1951 Northwest Territories general election held on September 17, 1951 was the sixth general election in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and the first since the 1902 election. The election came about after The Northwest Territories Act was amended to permit three elected members from the Mackenzie District to join the five appointed members on the Executive Council of the Northwest Territories. The Council, which had met in Ottawa, Ontario, outside of the Northwest Territories, shortly after the election, the council began to alternate sittings between Ottawa and Northwest Territories communities. ==Background== The bill to re initiate territorial elections in the Northwest Territories was introduced in the Canadian House of Commons by Federal Resources Minister Robert Henry Winters. ==Aboriginal vote== The 1951 election was the first in the territory to allow aboriginal peoples to vote and stand for election. However the electoral districts created for the election included only the west portion of the territories thus disenfranchising the prominently aboriginal eastern portion of the territory. When the nominations closed on August 20, 1951 no aboriginals stood for office. ==Female suffrage== Unlike the small elections in the Territories prior to the first general election in 1888, this was considered a general election, since it was based on the dissolution of the previous legislature. It was the smallest general election in Northwest Territories history. This was the first election in the Northwest Territories in which women had the right to vote. Female suffrage was permitted under the Northwest Territories Elections Ordinance of 1951, this was the last jurisdiction in Canada to grant voting rights to women. The first woman candidate in the territory's history also ran in this election: Vivian Roberts from Aklavik. The writ for the election was dropped on July 3, 1951 and the nominations closed on August 20, 1951. ==Election summary== {  - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Election summary !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"2\\"Popular vote - !# !! % - Elected candidates align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"right\\"1,471 align=\\"right\\"53.39% - Defeated candidates align=\\"center\\"8 align=\\"right\\"1,233 align=\\"right\\"44.76% - Rejected ballots align=\\"right\\" colspan=251 align=\\"right\\"1.85% - Total align=\\"center\\"11 align=\\"right\\"2,755 align=\\"right\\"100% - } ==Appointed members== {  +1st Northwest Territories Legislative Council - !Member !New/Re-appointed - Louis Audette Re-appointed - William Clements New - Donald McKay ? - Leonard Nicholson New - Frank Cunningham1 Re-appointed } Note: 1 Frank Cunningham was also Deputy Commissioner ==Elected members== For complete electoral history, see individual districts {  +1st Northwest Territories Legislative Council - !District !Member - Mackenzie South James Brodie - Mackenzie West Frank Carmichael - Mackenzie North Merv Hardie } ==See also== *List of Northwest Territories general elections *2nd Council of the Northwest Territories ==ReferencesExternal links== *History of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories Category:1951 elections in Canada Category:Elections in the Northwest Territories Category:20th century in the Northwest Territories Category:September 1951 events Category:1951 in the Northwest Territories ","title":"1951 Northwest Territories general election"},{"id":"2209483","text":"Arts & Crafts Productions is a music-focused media and artist services company that offers information as an independent record label, management firm, merchandiser, and publisher worldwide.

Romanized Arabic is used for a number of different purposes, among them transcription of names and titles, cataloging Arabic language works, language education when used moreover or alongside the Arabic script, and representation of the language in scientific publications by linguists. These formal systems, which often make use of diacritics and non-standard Latin characters and are used in academic settings or for the benefit of non-speakers, contrast with informal means of written communication used by speakers such as the Latin-based Arabic chat alphabet. Different systems and strategies have been developed to address the inherent problems of rendering various Arabic varieties in the Latin script. Examples of such problems are the symbols for Arabic phonemes that do not exist in English or other European languages; the means of representing the Arabic definite article, which is always spelled the same way in written Arabic but has numerous pronunciations in the spoken language depending on context; and the representation of short vowels (usually i u or e o, accounting for variations such as Muslim/Moslem or Mohammed/Muhammad/Mohamed). ==Method== Romanization is often termed \\"transliteration\\", but this is not technically correct. Transliteration is the direct representation of foreign letters using Latin symbols, while most systems for romanizing Arabic are actually transcription systems, which represent the sound of the language. As an example, the above rendering ' of the is a transcription, indicating the pronunciation; an example transliteration would be '. == Romanization standards and systems == Principal standards and systems are: ===Mixed digraphic and diacritical === * BGN/PCGN romanization (1956). * UNGEGN (1972).

Appropriate Unicode points would be modifier letter apostrophe ‚ü® º‚ü© and modifier letter turned comma ‚ü® ª‚ü© (for the UNGEGN and BGN/PCGN) or modifier letter reversed comma ‚ü® Ω‚ü© (for the Wehr and Survey of Egypt System (SES)), all of which Unicode defines as letters. Often right and left single quotation marks ‚ü®‚Äô‚ü©, ‚ü®‚Äò‚ü© are used instead, but Unicode defines those as punctuation marks, and they can cause compatibility issues. The glottal stop (') in these romanizations isn't written word-initially. * In Encyclopaedia of Islam digraphs are underlined, that is tÕüh, dÕüj, kÕüh, dÕüh, sÕüh, gÕüh. In BGN/PCGN on the contrary the sequences may be romanized with middle dot as t¬∑h, k¬∑h, d¬∑h, s¬∑h respectively; the letter g is not used by itself in BGN/PCGN, so no confusion between gh and g+h is possible. * In the original German edition of his dictionary (1952) Wehr used «ß, ·∏´, ƒ° for j, ·∏µ, ·∏° respectively (that is all the letters used are equal to DMG/DIN 31635). The variant presented in the table is from the English translation of the dictionary (1961). * BGN/PCGN allows use of underdots instead of cedilla. * ' and ' are traditionally written in Northwestern Africa as and , respectively, while the latter's dot is only added initially or medially. * In Egypt, Sudan, and sometimes in other regions, the standard form for final-' is only (without dots) in handwriting and print, for both final and final . for the latter pronunciation, is called ' , 'flexible alif'. * The sun and moon letters and hamzat wa·π£l pronunciation rules apply, although it is acceptable to ignore them. The UN system and ALA-LC prefer lowercase a and hyphens: al-Ba·π£rah, ar- RiyƒÅ·∏ç; BGN/PCGN prefers uppercase A and no hyphens: Al Ba·π£rah, Ar RiyƒÅ·∏ç. * The EALL suggests ·∫ì \\"in proper names\\" (volume 4, page 517). ==Romanization issues== Any romanization system has to make a number of decisions which are dependent on its intended field of application. === Vowels === One basic problem is that written Arabic is normally unvocalized; i.e., many of the vowels are not written out, and must be supplied by a reader familiar with the language. Hence unvocalized Arabic writing does not give a reader unfamiliar with the language sufficient information for accurate pronunciation. As a result, a pure transliteration, e.g., rendering as ', is meaningless to an untrained reader. For this reason, transcriptions are generally used that add vowels, e.g. '. However, unvocalized systems match exactly to written Arabic, unlike vocalized systems such as Arabic chat, which some claim detracts from one's ability to spell. === Transliteration vs. transcription === Most uses of romanization call for transcription rather than transliteration: Instead of transliterating each written letter, they try to reproduce the sound of the words according to the orthography rules of the target language: Qa·π≠ar. This applies equally to scientific and popular applications. A pure transliteration would need to omit vowels (e.g. q·π≠r ), making the result difficult to interpret except for a subset of trained readers fluent in Arabic. Even if vowels are added, a transliteration system would still need to distinguish between multiple ways of spelling the same sound in the Arabic script, e.g. ' vs. ' for the sound ', and the six different ways () of writing the glottal stop (hamza, usually transcribed '). This sort of detail is needlessly confusing, except in a very few situations (e.g., typesetting text in the Arabic script). Most issues related to the romanization of Arabic are about transliterating vs. transcribing; others, about what should be romanized: * Some transliterations ignore assimilation of the definite article al- before the \\"sun letters\\", and may be easily misread by non-Arabic speakers. For instance, \\"the light\\" an-n≈´r would be more literally transliterated along the lines of aln≈´r. In the transcription an-n≈´r, a hyphen is added and the unpronounced removed for the convenience of the uninformed non-Arabic speaker, who would otherwise pronounce an , perhaps not understanding that in n≈´r is geminated. Alternatively, if the shaddah is not transliterated (since it is strictly not a letter), a strictly literal transliteration would be aln≈´r, which presents similar problems for the uninformed non-Arabic speaker. * A transliteration should render the \\"closed tƒÅ º \\" (tƒÅ º marb≈´·π≠ah, ) faithfully. Many transcriptions render the sound as a or ah and t when it denotes . **ISO 233 has a unique symbol, ·∫ó. * \\"Restricted alif\\" (', ) should be transliterated with an acute accent, √°, differentiating it from regular alif , but it is transcribed in many schemes like alif, ƒÅ, because it stands for . * Nunation: what is true elsewhere is also true for nunation: transliteration renders what is seen, transcription what is heard, when in the Arabic script, it is written with diacritics, not by letters, or omitted. A transcription may reflect the language as spoken, typically rendering names, for example, by the people of Baghdad (Baghdad Arabic), or the official standard (Literary Arabic) as spoken by a preacher in the mosque or a TV newsreader. A transcription is free to add phonological (such as vowels) or morphological (such as word boundaries) information. Transcriptions will also vary depending on the writing conventions of the target language; compare English Omar Khayyam with German Omar Chajjam, both for , (unvocalized ', vocalized '). A transliteration is ideally fully reversible: a machine should be able to transliterate it back into Arabic. A transliteration can be considered as flawed for any one of the following reasons: *A \\"loose\\" transliteration is ambiguous, rendering several Arabic phonemes with an identical transliteration, or such that digraphs for a single phoneme (such as dh gh kh sh th rather than ·∏è ƒ° ·∏´ ≈° ·πØ ) may be confused with two adjacent consonants‚Äîbut this problem is resolved in the ALA-LC romanization system, where the prime symbol  π is used to separate two consonants when they do not form a digraph; for example: ' ('she honored her'), in which the t and h are two distinct consonantal sounds. *Symbols representing phonemes may be considered too similar (e.g.,  ª and ' or  ø and  æ for  ªayn and hamzah); *ASCII transliterations using capital letters to disambiguate phonemes are easy to type, but may be considered unaesthetic. A fully accurate transcription may not be necessary for native Arabic speakers, as they would be able to pronounce names and sentences correctly anyway, but it can be very useful for those not fully familiar with spoken Arabic and who are familiar with the Roman alphabet. An accurate transliteration serves as a valuable stepping stone for learning, pronouncing correctly, and distinguishing phonemes. It is a useful tool for anyone who is familiar with the sounds of Arabic but not fully conversant in the language. One criticism is that a fully accurate system would require special learning that most do not have to actually pronounce names correctly, and that with a lack of a universal romanization system they will not be pronounced correctly by non- native speakers anyway. The precision will be lost if special characters are not replicated and if a reader is not familiar with Arabic pronunciation. == Examples == Examples in Literary Arabic: {  - !

The major head of this movement was Louis Massignon, a French Orientalist, who brought his concern before the Arabic Language Academy in Damascus in 1928. Massignon's attempt at romanization failed as the Academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the Western world to take over their country. Sa'id Afghani, a member of the Academy, asserted that the movement to romanize the script was a Zionist plan to dominate Lebanon.History of Arabic Writing ===Egypt=== After the period of colonialism in Egypt, Egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and reemphasize Egyptian culture. As a result, some Egyptians pushed for an Egyptianization of the Arabic language in which the formal Arabic and the colloquial Arabic would be combined into one language and the Latin alphabet would be used. There was also the idea of finding a way to use hieroglyphics instead of the Latin alphabet. A scholar, Salama Musa, agreed with the idea of applying a Latin alphabet to Egyptian Arabic, as he believed that would allow Egypt to have a closer relationship with the West. He also believed that Latin script was key to the success of Egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology. This change in script, he believed, would solve the problems inherent with Arabic, such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words.Shrivtiel, p. 188 Ahmad Lutfi As Sayid and Muhammad Azmi, two Egyptian intellectuals, agreed with Musa and supported the push for romanization. The idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in Egypt continued with Abd Al Aziz Fahmi in 1944. He was the chairman for the Writing and Grammar Committee for the Arabic Language Academy of Cairo. He believed and desired to implement romanization in a way that allowed words and spellings to remain somewhat familiar to the Egyptian people. However, this effort failed as the Egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the Arabic alphabet, particularly the older generation. == See also == *Arabic Chat Alphabet *Arabic diacritics *Arabic grammar *Arabic names *Glottal stop (letter) *Maltese alphabet *Ottoman Turkish alphabet ‚Äì a Perso-Arabic-based alphabet, which was replaced by the Latin-based Turkish alphabet in 1928 *Romanization of Hebrew *Romanization of Persian *Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System (SATTS) ==References External links == * Comparative table of DIN 31635, ISO 233, ISO/R 233, UN, ALA-LC, and Encyclop√¶dia of Islam (not normative) Category:Arabic orthography ","title":"Romanization of Arabic"},{"id":"2209500","text":"HƒÅshim ibn ‚ÄòAbd ManƒÅf (; ), born ‚ÄòAmr al- øUlƒÅ (), was the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the progenitor of the ruling Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. At some point in his life before his father's death, ‚ÄòAmr chose for himself the name HƒÅshim, as it was the name God used for Abraham (‚ÄòAmr was a Hanif, follower of the \\"religion of Abraham\\"). The narrations from Islamic hagiographists to explain this name change are varied: A narration suggests that \`Amr was called Hashim because Hashim translates as pulverizer in Arabic-- As a generous man, he initiated the practice of providing crumbled bread in broth that was later adapted for the pilgrims to the Ka'aba in Mecca. Another narration claims the name derives from the Arabic root Hashm, to save the starving, because he arranged for the feeding of the people of Mecca during a seasonal famine, and he thus came to be known as \\"the man who fed the starved\\" (). ==Birth legend== Islamic hagiographers give an exotic narration concerning the birth of Hashim. Some consider it to be a very bloody and cruel one, indeed. This narration states that Hashim and 'Abd Shams were conjoined twins born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. It says that they had struggled in their mother's womb seeking to be firstborn. Their birth was remembered for Hashim being born with one of his toes pressed into the younger twin brother's forehead. Legend says that their father, 'Abd Manaf ibn Qusai, separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flown between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Bani al'Abbas and Bani Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH). The astrologers of Arabia predicted that Abd Manaf had committed a grave error when he separated both of them by means of a sword. That which he had done was not regarded by them as a good omen. ==Life== Hashim was the son of Abd Manaf, who argued with his brother 'Abd ad-Dar over the inheritance. 'Abd ad-Dar was supported by their cousins Makhzum, Sahm, Jumah, their uncle Adi and their families. Abd Manaf contested his inheritance and was supported by their nephew Asad, their uncle Zuhrah ibn Kilab, their father's uncle Taym ibn Murrah, and al-Harith ibn Fihr. The effects of this conflict continued among their descendants, especially and affected the internal history of Mecca right up to Muhammad's time. The conflict escalated under Hashim, who demanded that the rights be transferred from the clan of Abd ad-Dar to his clan. Those who supported Hashim and his brothers were the descendants of Zuhrah and Taym ibn Murrah, and all Qusay's descendants except those of the eldest line. The descendants of Makhzum and of the other remoter cousins maintained that the rights should remain in the family of Abd ad-Dar. While assembled at the Ka'aba, Hashim and his brothers and all their allies dipped their hands in a bowl of rich perfume with nutmeg powder and swore that they would never abandon one another, rubbing their scented hands over the stone of the Ka'aba in confirmation of their pact. Hashim and his allies were thereafter known as the \\"Hilf al-Mutayyabun\\" (\\"Alliance of the Scented Ones\\"), while their rivals also swore an oath of union and organised themselves into the \\"Hilf al-Ahlaf\\" (\\"Alliance of the Confederates\\"). As neither side wanted a full-scale conflict, they reached a compromise whereby The Scented Ones retained control of the charity tax and the food and drink for pilgrims, where as the Confederates retained the keys to the Ka'aba and the running of the House of Assembly.Ibn Kathir 1.186. Hashim's brothers agreed that he should have the responsibility of providing for the pilgrims. Their descendants in the clans named after them tended to keep this old alliance. Hashim was accepted as the overall leader, with the responsibility of providing for the pilgrims in the Ka‚Äôaba precincts, with the support of his brothers 'Abd Shams and Muttalib, and his half-brother Nawfal. The only person who challenged Hashim's authority was Umayyah, the son of his brother 'Abd Shams, but he had no real support and shifted to live out his life in Syria. Makkah became the acknowledged capital of Arabia, and markets were established around the city to deal with all the business. ==Legacy== Hashim was held in much honour, both at home and abroad. It was Amr who first realised the potential for his family of taking part in the lucrative trade between Syria and Egypt that passed through Arabia. Trading was the most important means of livelihood for the inhabitants of Mecca, a barren 'valley without cultivation'. He initiated and established the two great trade caravan journeys of Quraish from Mecca, the Caravan of Winter to Yemen and the Caravan of Summer to north-west Arabia, and beyond it to Palestine and Syria, which were then under Byzantine rule as part of the Roman Empire. After obtaining privileges from the Ghassanid king of Syria, even went in person to Byzantium and procured an edict from the Byzantine Roman Caesar, exempting Quraish from duties or taxes when operating in the countries under his domain. Caesar also wrote to the King Negus of Abyssinia to admit the Quraish there for trade, and Hashim's brother 'Abd Shams had a special permit with him. Muttalib had his treaty with the Himyarites of Yemen, and their half-brother Nawfal with the Persian governments of Iraq and Iran. He commenced by going in person to Aden in Yemen to meet the ships coming from India, purchased the stock and transported it first to Mecca and then on to Syria, Gaza or Egypt. There he bought up goods of local manufacture and brought them back to Mecca, mainly selling them at the various Arab markets and fairs. Thus, the Quraish engaged in trade in Yemen, Syria and Ankara which allowed them to flourish economically. The Quraysh were so respected and popular that they felt no fears for their caravans being robbed or harmed along the way, and the various tribes did not even attempt to charge them the usual heavy transit taxes they demanded from other caravans. He was generous to a fault, and it was his practical compassion in one year of drought that earned him his famous nickname of Hashim, the Crusher. This was not for crushing or oppressing anyone, but because when the people were starving and emaciated he provided food at his own expense for the entire population of Mecca, personally fetching an immense stock of flour from Syria by camel- caravan, then slaughtering the camels and crushing the bread and meat to provide a soup-kitchen for his people. His descendants are still proudly called Hashemites to this day.‚ÄòLata‚Äôif al-ma‚Äôarif, Tha‚Äôalibi, Edinburgh, 1968, p.42; Ibn Kathir 1.132, from Ibn Ishaq; Ibn Sa‚Äôd vol 1 p.77 ==Death== According to the 19th Dai of the Dawoodi Bohras, Idris Imad al-Din, who was also an established historian, Hashim died after falling ill on a journey returning from Syria, in Gaza, Palestine in 497. According to tradition, Hashim's tomb is located beneath the dome of Sayed al-Hashim Mosque in the al- Daraj neighborhood of Gaza which is named in his honor. The mosque itself was built around the 12th century. His business passed to none of his sons, but to his brothers, the sons of Atikah bint Murrah. ==Family== His father was 'Abd Manaf ibn Qusai who according to Islamic tradition is a descendant of Ibrahim (Abraham) through his son Ismail (Ishmael). His mother was  ªƒÄtikah bint Murrah ibn HilƒÅl ibn FƒÅlij ibn DhakwƒÅn. Hashim had two full brothers, the elder was 'Abd Shams and younger was Muttalib who would succeed him, and half-brother Nawfal whose mother was Waqida bint Amr. He had at least five wives, four sons, and six daughters. His first three wives were his grandmother Hubba bint Hulail's niece Qaylah (or Hind) bint Amr ibn Malik of the Banu Khuza'a, Halah (Hind) bint Amr ibn Thalabah al-Khazrajiyah, and a woman from the Banu Quda'a, the people of Qusai's stepfather who had been so supportive of his cause. For his fourth wife, he married his father's widow, Waqida bint Amr (Abu Adiy) al- Maziniyyah, who was the mother of his half-brother Nawfal. His fifth wife was Salma bint Amr, a woman from Yathrib, one of the most influential women of the Banu Khazraj tribe and the daughter of 'Amr of Banu Najjar clan. By Qaylah, he had a son Asad (Ali's maternal grandfather). By Halah, he had the son Abu Saifi, and daughter Hayyah (or Hannah). By Waqida, he had the daughters Khalidah and Da'ifa. By the woman of Banu Quda'a, he had the son Nadla (or Nadh) and daughter Ash-Shifa. By Salma bint Amr he had Shaiba/'Abd al- Mu·π≠·π≠alib- the paternal grandfather of Muhammad- and a daughter Ruqayyah. There was another son Sayfayyah, and another daughter Jannah. ==Notable descendants== Family Tree ==See also== *Family tree of Muhammad *List of notable Hijazis ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Gerald de Gaury, Rulers of Mecca ==External links== *al- islam.org Category:464 births Category:497 deaths Category:5th-century Arabs Category:Ancestors of Muhammad Category:Quraysh ","title":"Hashim ibn Abd Manaf"},{"id":"2209524","text":"Akhkhazu is a female demon from the Akkadic mythology.

The film was directed by Max Nosseck. Dillinger was the first major film to star Lawrence Tierney. The B-movie was shot in black and white and features a smoke-bomb bank robbery edited into the film from the 1937 Fritz Lang film You Only Live Once. The film was released on DVD by Warner Bros. for the Film Noir Classic Collections 2 in 2005, even though the film generally is not regarded as being film noir. Some sequences were shot at Big Bear Lake, California. ==Plot summary== A newsreel plays, summing up the gangster life of John Dillinger in detail. At the end of the newsreel, Dillinger's father walks onto the stage and speaks to the movie audience about his son's childhood back in Indiana, which he says was ordinary and not very eventful, but concedes that his son had ambitions and wanted to go his own way. The young Dillinger left his town to find his fortune in Indianapolis, but soon ran out of money. The scene fades to a restaurant, where John is on a date and finds himself humiliated by the waiter who refuses to accept a check for the meal; John excuses himself, runs into a nearby grocery store and robs it for $7.20 in cash. He makes the clerk at the store believe he has a gun in his hand under the jacket. John is soon arrested for this felony, and he is sentenced to prison. When incarcerated, he becomes good friends with Specs Green, his cell mate. Specs is an infamous bank robber whose gangMarco Minnelli, Doc Madison and Kirk Ottoare also in the same prison. John is impressed by Specs and his experience and intelligence, and begins to look up to him as a father figure. Because John has a much shorter sentence, he decides he will be the gang's outside help when he is released, intending to facilitate their escape. As soon as John is free, he holds up the box office at a movie theater. Before he does, he flirts with the female clerk, Helen Rogers, with the result that she refuses to identify him in the police line-up after the robbery. Instead she goes on a date with John. John continues his criminal spree of robberies for money to finance the escape of Specs' gang. When he has enough, he devises a plan to smuggle a barrel of firearms to the gang at their quarry job site. The plan succeeds, they add John to their gang, then start a crime wave of robberies in the American Midwest. Specs sends John to scout for new targets because he is the only one not recognized by the witnesses at the quarry at the time of the gang's escape. John checks out the Farmer's Trust Bank, where he poses as a potential customer to get inside the office. He reports back to the gang that the security system is too sophisticated for them to bypass. Specs still wants to hit the bank, and getting tired of John's ego and trigger-happiness, he decides to get help from outside the gang. John suggests another way to get into the bank ‚Äì with gas bombs. John convinces the rest of the gang of his way, and they successfully rob the bank. Back at the hideout, John demands the leader's usual double share of the loot. After John is captured but escapes from jail, he kills Specs and takes his place as the leader of the gang. Running low on cash, they decide to rob a mail train. In the process, gang member Kirk Otto is killed. The gang part for a few weeks to lay low, and John and Helen go on a big shopping spree. They meet with the rest of the gang at a cabin lodge owned by Kirk's surrogate parents. They stay there for a while, but when the elderly couple calls the police, Dillinger kills them. Later, they realize that the police are closing in on them, so they plan to head to the Western States and continue robbing banks. Before going, Dillinger and his girlfriend spend an evening at the Biograph movie theater in Chicago. Exiting the theater, Dillinger sees the police coming after him. In a gunfight, he is killed in an alley, his only money is $7.20the same as what he took in his first robbery. ==CastProduction== Philip Yordan was an emerging writer who had been collaborating with George Beck. The King Brothers had a deal with Monogram Pictures and wanted Beck to write them a gangster picture but could not offer Beck's regular fee so he recommended Yordan instead. Yordan wrote Dillinger, but Monogram's head of production Steve Broidy thought it would cost $50,000 and would be too expensive unless they could hire a name actor to play the lead, like Chester Morris. Yordan wanted Lawrence Tierney to play the role as \\"boy he looked like Dillinger and he was mean\\". He refused to see the script unless he was cast. Yordan went on to write other scripts for the King Brothers instead, The Unknown Guest and When Strangers Marry. Both were successful, and Tierney was cast in Dillinger, which was given a decent budget. Yordan says that William Castle was meant to direct the film and he was great assistance on the script. Robert Tasker also may have worked uncredited on the script.http://www.filmnoirfoundation.org/PhilipYordan.pdf ==Reception== According to Philip Yordan, all the major studios had an agreement not to make movies that might glorify actual gangsters by name, but Monogram was not part of it. He says Louis B. Mayer asked Frank King to destroy the negative, but King refused when Mayer did not offer any compensation. Yordan says the film made $4 million of which he got a third. It is not known whether this pact actually existed. Yordan believes he should have won the Academy Award for Best Script, but that the Academy, led by Walter Wanger, deliberately overlooked it in favor of Marie Louise, \\"some picture made in Switzerland that nobody had ever seen\\". Yordan also claims that \\"Dillinger was one of the early crime films of its type. Darryl Zanuck ran that picture again and again, and used it for the basis of many pictures at Fox. In other words, I had created a style.\\" ===Awards=== Yordan was nominated for the Oscar for Writing Original Screenplay, earning Monogram Pictures its first Oscar nomination for a feature-length film release.

God's Playground. 2 vols. New York: Columbia Univ. Press. and ] ==Background== The Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland was created to take the place of the previous governmental body, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego or PKWN). Because of its location in Lublin, the PKWN was also known as the \\"Lublin Committee\\". The establishment of the RTRP was an important step in strengthening the control of the Polish Workers' Party and the Soviet Union in Poland. ==HistoryCreation=== On 1 January 1945, the Polish Committee of National Liberation became the Provisional Government of Republic of Poland. In London, the Polish government-in-exile protested. They issued a declaration that the Soviet Union had \\"taken over the sovereign political rights of the Polish nation.\\" The governments of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt also issued formal protest, but they took no further action. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland did not recognize the Polish government-in-exile and proclaimed itself to be the legitimate government of Poland. Initially, the RTRP was only officially recognized by the Soviet Union. But before the Yalta Conference, Joseph Stalin conveyed his intention to the Western Allies that Poland was under the control of the Soviet Union and that he intended for it to stay that way. The RTRP was given control of the Polish territories seized by the Red Army as it advanced westward. The RTRP was chaired by the previous Prime Minister of PKWN, Edward Os√≥bka-Morawski. The Deputy Prime Ministers of the RTRP were W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR, for Polska Partia Robotnicza) and Stanis≈Çaw Janusz from People's Party. The Minister of defense was Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski. The Minister of Security was Stanis≈Çaw Radkiewicz. The Polish Workers' Party declared that the RTRP was to be a coalition, but in practice all key posts were controlled by PPR. Semi-official control of the RTRP was exercised by Soviet General Ivan Serov. Some Polish Communists, like W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka and Edward Ochab, were opposed to this excessive Soviet control. However, they could do little to change the existing status quo. On 18 January, the RTRP was relocated from Lublin to Warsaw. From 30 January to 2 February, the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States‚Äî Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively ‚Äî attended preliminary discussions on the Yalta Conference in Malta. From 4 February to 12 February, the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union attended the Yalta Conference in the Crimea. At Yalta, the following \\"Joint Allied Declaration on Poland\\" was developed: > The three heads of governments consider that the Eastern frontier of Poland > should follow the Curzon line, with digressions from it in some regions of > five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland. They recognize that Poland must > receive substantial of accessions of territory in the north and west. They > feel that the opinion of the new Polish Provisional Government of National > Unity should be sought in due course on the extent of these accessions, and > that the final delimitation of the Western frontier of Poland should > thereafter await the Peace Conference.[Page 158, \\"The Decline and Fall of > Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan\\", Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress > Catalogue Card Number 67-27047] On 7 February, Churchill documented the following discussion while at Yalta: On 23 April, Soviet diplomat Vyacheslav Molotov was in Washington, DC. President Harry S. Truman and the United States Department of State appealed to Molotov for a compromise on the \\"Polish question\\". On the same day, Prime Minister Edward Os√≥bka-Morawski of the RTRP announced the following at a press conference: > We need people who agree with our foreign policy and with our social > reforms. Only such a government can do its work properly. We need the > collaboration of men who accept the Yalta decisions, not only formally, but > in fact. We are making every effort to contact such people. What we do not > want are Fascists . . . ===Provisional Government of National Unity replaces the RTRP=== On 28 June 1945, the Provisional Government of Republic of Poland (RzƒÖd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) was transformed into the more coalition-like Provisional Government of National Unity (Tymczasowy RzƒÖd Jedno≈õci Narodowej). This was promised by Stalin at Yalta and done by him as gesture of good will towards the Western Allies and Polish government-in-exile in London. ==See also== * Polish Committee of National Liberation (; PKWN) - 1944 and 1945 * Provisional Government of National Unity (; TRJN)- 1945 to 1947 * People's Army of Poland (; LWP) * Polish government-in-exile == References == Category:1944 establishments in Poland Category:Government of Poland Category:Poland in World War II Category:Poland‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:Political history of Poland Category:Provisional governments Category:Stalinism in Poland ","title":"Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland"},{"id":"2209550","text":"Abd Manaf al-Mughirah ibn Qusai (, Abd ManƒÅf al-Mughƒ´rah ibn Qu·π£ayy) was a Qurayshi and great-great-grandfather of Islamic prophet Muhammad.
