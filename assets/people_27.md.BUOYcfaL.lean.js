It was released by Fantasy Records, part of Concord Music, on 17 November 2014. ==Background== Family was conceived by Teddy Thompson when, after he lost his recording contract with Verve Records and came to the end of a serious relationship, he approached his musical family members to contribute to an all-Thompson album. Teddy Thompson states: \\"I had some kind of mid-life crisis early and was having a real hard time with personal stuff...so I decided to make this record\\", stating further that \\"family is really important, and I've missed them\\". He told Uncut: \\"I came up with this project to get everyone back together. I was really trying to heal some wounds for myself, but I dragged everyone along with me\\", stating elsewhere that one of the rules for the album were that \\"every instrument must be played by a family member\\". According to New Yorker magazine, the Thompson family \\"rival the Wainwright-McGarrigle- Roche clan when it comes to multigenerational musical talent\\". The musicians involved on this album span three generations and include Teddy Thompson's long separated parents Richard and Linda Thompson, his sister Kami Thompson and her husband James Walbourne (also her bandmate in The Rails) as well as nephew Zak Thompson and half-brother Jack Thompson (son of Richard Thompson from his second marriage). The band is completed with assistance from Walbourne's brother Rob on drums and Teddy Thompson's eldest sister Muna Mascolo, who is not a musician, on backing vocals. ==Writing and recording== The various musicians contributed a song or two each as well as playing on each other's material. According to Richard Thompson, the contributions took \\"two to three years\\" to compile, with everyone writing their own material and sending files to each other. The album was then worked on throughout 2013 by Teddy Thompson and completed with studio sessions in London and New York afterwards with all the participating family members in attendance. Various members of the family have commented on the rivalry the album has raised amongst themselves. Kami Thompson commented on the project: \\"The whole album is like a family songwriting competition – it's a bloody nightmare. I mean, what could possibly go wrong\\"? Similarly, Teddy Thompson stated that \\"the album became something of a family songwriting contest\\", but conceded elsewhere that \\"it's not as if we're having family therapy and making everyone pay 12 bucks to hear it\\". NPR Music comment in an article that \\"what you get here is a family album in the truest sense of the world, with everyone involved clamoring to be heard while competing for attention with people they love\\". Richard Thompson gives a metaphorical explanation for Family, stating that the album is \\"like an enormous cardigan with eight holes for heads (that) you knit everyone into\\", telling Mojo that \\"it's fun to do\\". Family was released on CD, vinyl, and as a digital download. A deluxe CD was also released which included a DVD containing the short documentary Thompson: The Making of Family. ==Critical reception== On the Metacritic website, which aggregates reviews from critics and assigns a normalised rating out of 100, Family received a score of 75, based on 3 mixed and 9 positive reviews. Record Collector called the Thompsons \\"an astonishingly talented family\\" in their review, commenting that \\"most of them have made records of note on their own over the last year or so, but this union is something very special indeed\\". Q state that \\"what could have diluted their individual talents instead enhances everyone's reputation\\" and call Family \\"the greatest family jam you'll ever hear and an absolutely essential album\\". The Daily Telegraph write that \\"there was bound to be a competitive edge but all the various age groups rise to the occasion\\" and call it \\"a fine album\\". The Guardian state that \\"you wouldn’t want to share a group therapy session with them, but it makes for a musically fabulous and lyrically compelling album\\" in their review. Uncut write that Family is \\"a more nuanced guide to the Thompsons’ flawed but just-about functioning dynamic, divorces, remarriages and all\\", calling the album \\"dysfunctional but somehow comforting\\". On a similar theme, Consequence of Sound write in their review of the album that \\"there is a creative disquiet about it, as much dysfunction as affection\\" and claim there is an \\"inevitable lack of cohesion\\". AllMusic write that \\"if it doesn't always feel like the dream collaboration between these gifted relations, Family clearly demonstrates what makes them special, individually and collectively\\". Opinion is divided however, with \\"the family firm ... clearly in excellent health\\" according to Mojo who call the album \\"an unusually harmonious kind of family get-together\\". The Observer review claims that \\"inevitably it’s the contributions of the parents who attract most interest\\" but call it Family \\"an enjoyable, ramshackle collection\\". The review at Folk Radio UK states \\"there can be few if any more talented musical families and the proof is right here\\". ==Track listingPersonnel== *Jack Thompson – bass (6) *Linda Thompson – vocals (1, 4, 8 & 9) *Richard Thompson – acoustic guitar (2, 6 & 9), vocals (2 & 9), doumbek (2 & 9), electric guitar (3 & 6), hurdy-gurdy (5) *Kami Thompson – vocals (3, 9 & 10), acoustic guitar (10) *Teddy Thompson – acoustic guitar (1 & 7), vocals (1, 2, 3, 4, 7 & 9), bass (2 & 7), pump organ (5, 8 & 9), piano (8), electric guitar (8) *Zak Thompson – acoustic guitar (1, 4 & 5), electric guitar (2 & 3), mandolin (2 & 9), slide guitar (7), vocals (5 & 9) *James Walbourne – bass (3), acoustic guitar (3 & 10), electric guitar (7 & 9), vocals (9 & 10) *Rob Walbourne – drums & percussion (2, 3, 7 & 9), organ (3), vocals (9) *Paulina Liss – vocals (3 & 7) *Muna Mascalo – vocals (9) *Brooke Gengras – vocals (9) ==References== Category:2014 debut albums Category:Concord Music Group albums Category:Fantasy Records albums Category:Thompson (folk rock band) albums ","title":"Family (Thompson album)"},{"id":"46814262","text":"Ronald J.

Her writings on the role of women, were revolutionary for her time. Her magazine, Violets of Anahuac in 1887, changed the paradigm by promoting as the core ideology of the magazine, the feminine ideal of a cultured, educated wife and mother. The publication promoted female education and insisted that the intellectual equality between men and women was the means of emancipation. She was one of the first feminist theorists in Mexico, asking women to question their role in society and the conditions in which they lived. She covered topics such as education, women's suffrage and legal equality between men and women. She wrote patriotic poetry and served as the vice president of the Spiritualist Society of Mexico, which she joined because one of its principles held that men and women were of equal intelligence. ==Biography== Laureana Wright González was born on 4 July 1846 in Taxco, Guerrero, Mexico to American father James Wright and his Guerreran wife, Eulalia González. The family relocated to Mexico City, for better economic opportunities when Wright was a child and there learned Spanish, English and French. From the age of sixteen, she studied literature, philosophy and history with teachers such as Ignacio Ramírez, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Francisco Pimentel and José María Vigil and in 1865, she began writing patriotic poetry. In 1868, she married Sebastian Kleinhans, with whom she had a daughter, Margaret. She divorced one year after the marriage and devoted her time to writing. De Kleinhans was one of the first Mexican writers to express that women should have a public voice and should be educated. She postulated that by keeping women ignorant, they were treated no better than property. She discussed the social impacts of inequality and the lack of legal provisions, which led to women's subjugation. She was a journalist for publications such as El Monitor Republicano, El Bien Público and El álbum de la mujer. Despite her friendship with Delfina Ortega Diaz, the president's first wife, she was almost expelled from the country for her collaboration with the Diario del Hogar, criticizing the labor policy of President Porfirio Diaz. In 1869, she was admitted as an honorary member of the Society of Nezahualcoyotl, at the request of its founders, Manuel Acuña and Gerardo M. Silva. She joined the scientific society El Porvenir in 1872, where she published several of her poems. In 1873, she was appointed to the membership of the Liceo Hidalgo, a literary society in which almost all intellectuals in Mexico gathered, at the request of Ignacio Ramírez and Francisco Pimentel. In 1885 de Kleinhans became a member of the Liceo Mexicano, as well as the Liceo Altamirano of Oaxaca. At that time, almost all literary societies were male dominated. For women to have a public voice, they felt that it was imperative to speak in the educated style of men, thus de Kleinhans sought memberships that would give her literary standing. In 1884 she founded and directed the magazine Violetas de Anáhuac (Violets of the Anahuac); \\"Anáhuac\\" is an Aztec word for the geographical area around Mexico City. In 1887 she founded the newspaper Mujeres de Anáhuac (Anahuac Women). Violets was a revolutionary journal for its time, as rather than promoting the culture of domesticity, the aim of the journal was to promote female education and to assert that women and men were intellectually equal. To bring home the point that women were capable of remarkable achievement, the journal collected and printed biographies of Mexican women, including such notable Mexicans as Sister Juana Inés de la Cruz and the second wife of Mexican President Porfirio Díaz, Carmen Romero Rubio de Díaz. It also included the histories of 29 indigenous women, which was a definitive break from the typical Euro-centric histories written at that time. Although de Kleinhans did not believe in spiritualism when she first encountered it, and denounced it in the Violetas de Anáhuac, she became a follower of Allan Kardec because of his belief that men and women had equal intelligence. She ended up being a fervent follower of Kardecian spiritualism, and became vice president of the Spiritualist Society of Mexico. She also explored Freemasonry which in the nineteenth century was being heralded as a means of removing the influences of the Catholic Church. She ultimately rejected the organization because they refused to acknowledge the equality of men and women and in fact had an initiation oath which declared \\"never admit to their ranks a blind man, a madman, or a woman\\". She died 22 September 1896 in Mexico City, Mexico. Mujeres notables mexicanas (1910) was released posthumously. It is an important work, as it is a collection of the biographies de Kleinhans had assembled of distinguished Mexican women. It contains 116 biographies, beginning with pre-conquest subjects and extending to the second half of the nineteenth century. It was one of the few books which included women as a part of the history of Mexico before the twentieth century. ==Selected worksPoems=== *\\"A Cuba\\" *\\"El 5 de mayo de 1862\\" ===Books=== *Violetas del Anáhuac: periódico literario: redactado por señoras (1888) (In Spanish) Available at Biblioteca Nacional de Mexico (OCLC #651191638) *La emancipación de la Mujer por medio del estudio Imprenta nueva: Mexico (1891) (In Spanish) *Educación errónea de la mujer y medios prácticos para correjirla Imprenta nueva: Mexico (1892) (In Spanish) *Mujeres notables mexicanas Tipografía económica: Mexico (1910) (In Spanish) ==References== Category:1846 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Mexican women's rights activists Category:Mexican feminists Category:Mexican feminist writers Category:Mexican people of American descent Category:Writers from Guerrero Category:People from Taxco Category:19th-century Mexican women writers Category:19th-century Mexican writers ","title":"Laureana Wright de Kleinhans"},{"id":"46814299","text":"Miss Match (Marathi: मिस मॅच ) is a 2014 Marathi romantic drama film directed by Girish Vasaikar.

It is native to the southeastern United States (Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina).Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map It is the type species of Genus Balduina. Balduina uniflora is a perennial herb with branching stems. Each plant has 1-4 flower heads, each with 8-22 yellow ray florets and 50-180 orange or yellow disc florets. The species grows in wet pinelands and savannahs,Flora of North America, Balduina uniflora Nuttall, Gen. N. Amer. Pl. 2: 175. 1818. as well as wetland areas and on the edges of bogs and tends to occur in wet drainage ditches and on roadsides. == Description == Balduina uniflora is a perennial herbaceous plant and can grow to be 0.4 to 1 meter tall. It has fibrous roots and erect stems, and the stems are ribbed. Stems also tend to be branched, except for those that bear flower heads. Leaves, stems, involucres, and peduncles are green and pubescent, except for the bottoms of leaves which may be glabrous or with only sparse hair. Leaves are alternate and tend to be clustered at the base of the plant, getting smaller and more sparse as they reach the apex. Photo of Balduina uniflora showing characteristic honeycomb-like clusters of disc flowers, each surrounded by receptacular bracts. Photo credit: Larry Allain, U.S. Geological Survey. Like other members of family Asteraceae, the \\"flowers\\" of this species are actually inflorescences called flower heads, composed of hundreds of individual flowers. The inflorescence has many bracts at its base forming a green bell-shaped or hemispheric incolucre. The yellow petal-like ray florets are sterile and tend to have 3-5 lobes at the edge. The more central disc florets are perfect, containing several arrow-shaped stamen as well as a pistil made up of two ovaries. Each pistil has a yellow two-branched style which extends out of the floret. The plant gets its name from characteristic honeycomb-like bract structures (chaff) most visible at fruit maturity. Also like others in the Asteraceae family, B. uniflora bears achene-like cypselae: dry, indehiscent fruits with a single seed that develops from the two carpals of the flower. This fruit is generally 1.3-2.2mm in length. This species differs from others in the genus Balduina by its wider corolla rays, larger pollen grains, and by having chromosome arrangement of n=36 rather than n=18 in other species. == Cultivation == Balduina uniflora is not usually a commercially available species, but may be grown from seeds for ornamental purposes in native wildflower gardens. The species prefers wet and boggy soils as well as high levels of sunlight. == Possible polyploidy == A 1975 study of Balduina conducted by Earl S. Parker and Samuel B. Jones found a chromosomal arrangement of n=36 in B. uniflora collected across 16 different areas, which differed from the n=18 arrangement of the other two species in the Balduina genus, leading to the theory that the species is a widespread polyploid. No assumptions as to whether this chromosomal arrangement was allopolyploid or autopolyploid in origin were made. == Ecology == Balduina uniflora is currently not listed by the IUCN Red List. This species is listed by the NatureServe organization as \\"Apparently Secure (S4)\\" nationwide, but as \\"Vulnerable (S3)\\" and \\"Imperiled (S2)\\" in North and South Carolina, respectively.

Fiscal contribution from mining operations to Eswatini’s GDP is 2% and also accounts for 2% of export earnings. ==History== The history of the mining sector of the country is ancient, traced to the iron ore mine of the western Ngwenya mountains, which has since 1975 been closed. Ngwenya Mine is said to be the oldest iron ore mine in the world. In recent years there is resurgence of this sector. Geological mapping of the country has been done to scale of 1:50,000, which is being updated. ==Legal framework== The Mining Department is responsible for the mining and minerals industry. Laws promulgated in this respect are the Mines and Minerals Act No, 4 of 2011, Diamond Act No. 3 of 2011, Explosives Act, Mines and machinery regulations, and Mines and Quarries (safety) Regulations. Additional regulations are under review. ==Production and impact== The important mines in the country include the Bulembu asbestos mine, the Emaswati colliery and the Dvokolwako diamond mines and quarries. While the high quality anthracite coal of the Maloma Coal mine continues to be extracted as the quality of the coal produced is eight-ash grade compared to the earlier ten-ash variety. From the Dvokolwako Mine, diamond production was expected to achieve a yield of 80,000 carats per year. Asbestos production, which was exploited to a large extent, is faced with problems due to decrease in international pricing. The tailings of the Ngwenya iron ore mine (the mine itself closed in 1977) are planned to be reworked to extract 2 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate annually. Gold extractions from the northwestern region of the country have been planned, with the Piggs Peak mine getting revived. More sites have been prospected for extraction to sustain an economic development of the mining sector. ==Commodities== Minerals under extraction in the country include coal, diamonds, gold, kaolin and silica. Other minerals such as arsenic, copper, manganese and tin are also found but are not found economical to extract. Coal and diamonds are mined for exports while quarries cater to the local needs. ==Outlook== The mineral industry is faced with a low level of exploration and exploitation, which is unlikely to change in the near future on account of inadequate infrastructure facilities, and also due to a high degree of HIV/AIDS among its population. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Mining in Eswatini Eswatini ","title":"Mining industry of Eswatini"},{"id":"46814372","text":"Kim Clijsters and Martina Navratilova were the defending champions and successfully defended their title, defeating Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe Fernández in the final, 2–6, 6–2, [11–9]. ==DrawFinal=Group A=== Standings are determined by: 1) Number of wins; 2) Number of matches; 3) In three-players-ties, percentage of sets won, or of games won; 4) Steering Committee decision. ===Group B=== Standings are determined by: 1) Number of wins; 2) Number of matches; 3) In three-players-ties, percentage of sets won, or of games won; 4) Steering Committee decision. ==References== *Main Draw Women's Legends Doubles ","title":"2015 French Open – Women's Legends Doubles"},{"id":"46814374","text":"Ponnur mandal is one of the 57 mandals in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the hypercoaster model opened to the public on June 10, 2016. Mako is named after the mako shark and is located in the Sea of Mystery section of the park. It reaches a height of , a maximum speed of , and features a track length of . The roller coaster was marketed as the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in Orlando and has been well-received, ranking every year since its opening in the top 50 of the annual Golden Ticket Awards publication from Amusement Today. It attained its highest ranking of 15 in 2019. The ride is one of five roller coasters at SeaWorld Orlando and the first since Manta opened in 2009. ==History== In April 2015, SeaWorld officials began teasing an upcoming announcement of a new thrill ride for their flagship park in Orlando, Florida. At the time, the only detail revealed was that the roller coaster would be 200 feet in height and would become the longest, tallest, and fastest roller coaster in the city. A month later on May 13, 2015, SeaWorld filed a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the name \\"Mako\\" along with \\"Reef Hunter\\". On May 27, 2015, SeaWorld officially announced the construction of Mako, which was named after the mako shark. The mako has been identified as the fastest species of shark in the ocean. During the time of announcement, a simulated point-of-view shot was released depicting the ride's intended route along the park's lagoon. On August 17, 2015, the first pieces of track began to ship from Ohio to Orlando, and started to arrive on site two days later. On January 6, 2016, the roller coaster's lift hill was topped-out. The first car of the train was shipped and revealed on February 16, 2016, with the car design exhibiting the face of a mako shark. On March 15, 2016, the last piece of track was put into place. In April 2016, SeaWorld began showing a presentation called \\"Mako Rising\\" previewing the upcoming roller coaster in their Nautilis Theater, and later testing began on the ride with the park releasing an on- ride POV. Mako's soft opening was on June 2, 2016, with the official media day to introduce the roller coaster being hosted on June 9, 2016. A day after, its official opening to the public was on June 10, 2016. In addition to the ride's opening, a summer-dedicated event named \\"Summer of Mako\\" was hosted from June to August 2016 throughout the park and its sister water-park Aquatica Orlando. == Ride experience  Entrance and queue area === The roller coaster is themed to the mako shark. Similarly the 2-acre (0.81 ha) park area around it, entitled \\"Shark Wreck Reef\\", is themed to sharks. The area features recycled art, a mural created by Guy Harvey, and educational pieces about human and shark interactions. As guests go through the queue area, various educational displays and an additional Guy Harvey exhibit can be seen. The queue of the ride consists of a wooden pier, where the riders are situated under while waiting. During the queue, guests take on the point of view of a mako shark as it traverses through preying grounds. The theme of Mako's station is a shipwreck. Before the ride's train dispatches, a panel located above the riders shows scenes of shadowy figures consisting of a group of sharks migrating forward with accommodating visuals and sound. === Layout === After leaving the station, the train makes a small right turn to a 200-foot (61 m) lift hill (which is right next to Kraken's dive loop) to begin its ascent. After reaching the top, it enters a 200-foot (61 m) drop, in which the train reaches at a top speed of 73 miles per hour (117 km/h). Then, the train makes a tall, overbanked turn, hugging the side of the lake, before an airtime hill. After the hill, the track reverses direction via a Hammerhead turn. Traveling over another camelback hill, there is a series of airtime hills as the track travels back along the lake before hitting the mid-course brake run. Off the mid-course brakes, the track makes a small left turn under the lift hill and goes into another airtime hill. After it makes a banked turn to the right, the track goes into another banked turn to the left over a part of the park's lagoon and then hits the final brake run. == Characteristics  Track === Mako's train as it traverses through the final turn over water. The steel box track of Mako is long and the lift is approximately high. The track pieces were shipped on flatbed trucks from Clermont Steel Fabricators in Batavia, Ohio to Orlando, Florida where they were assembled. The track of the roller coaster is purple with the supports colored blue. The roller coaster was designed to have nine airtime moments and a third of the layout traverses over water. === Trains === Mako operates with lead and fiberglass trains each containing seven cars. Every seat has its own lap bar restraint and each car seats four riders in a single row for a total of 28 riders per train. The trains were designed with the physiology of a mako with gills on either side of the train, and feature polyurethane wheels that help to reduce friction on the track. They were manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard in Switzerland. == Reception == alt= Mako has been positively received among guests and critics. Dewayne Bevil from the Orlando Sentinel described the ride as \\"breathtaking\\" and stated \\"SeaWorld has delivered on its marketing promise with the fastest, tallest, longest coaster in the Orlando market\\". Marjie Lambert from the Miami Herald commented that the ride was like a \\"retro coaster\\" and mentioned \\"its design is reminiscent of old wooden coasters where the track couldn’t be shaped into the pretzels and upside down loops that are so popular in today’s steel coasters\\". Sharon Wynne from the Tampa Bay Times suggested \\"it will likely to take two or three more trips on this coaster to appreciate all its tricks\\" and coaster enthusiast Jim Terry attending the soft opening had acclaimed it was the best roller coaster in Florida. Arthur Levine of USA Today remarked that \\"it's more than enough to get pulses racing and senses heightened, but not so much as to cause tunnel vision, grayouts, or other unpleasant side effects\\". Elle Gordon of the Irish Independent likened the \\"weightless airtime\\" as a highlight of her park visit and added it was well worth a night time ride. Russell Meyer of Theme Park Insider observed the themeing of the roller coaster and its surrounding area was \\"excellently done\\" with the accommodating effects and music a \\"nice touch\\". === Awards === {  - ! style=\\"text-align:center; background:white;\\" colspan=\\"500\\"Golden Ticket Awards: Best New Ride for 2016 - white;\\" ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Ranking 3 - } == See also == * 2016 in amusement parks ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official attraction page Category:SeaWorld Orlando Category:2016 establishments in Florida Category:Hypercoasters manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard ","title":"Mako (roller coaster)"},{"id":"46814503","text":"Baur au Lac, Zurich Baur au Lac is a luxury hotel at Talstrasse, Zürich, Switzerland.

Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part L Hammatoceratidae is now divided into four subfamilies,Hammatoceratidae in Fossilworks the Hammatoceratinae, Erycitinae, Podagrosiceratinae, and Zurcheriinae. Hammatoceratinae includes Bredyia, Crestaites, Erycitoides, Euaptetoceras, Eudmetoceras, Fissilobiceras, Hammatoceras, Onychoceras, Paviatites, Planammatoceras, Pseudaptetoceras, and Puchenquia. Fissilobiceras, included in the Sonniniidae in the Treatise, 1957, differs from typical hammatoceratids in being rather involude and smooth shelled. The Erycitinae is said to include Erycites, Abbasotes, and Cagliceras. The Treatise Part L, 1957, includes Erycites and Abbasotes in the Hammatoceratinae. Cagliceras, named by Rulleau and Elmi, was added in 2001. Podagrosiceratinae named by Westermann and Riccardi, 1979, includes Podagrosiceras Maubeuge and Lambert, 1956, Sphaerocoeloceras, and Westermanniceras. D.T. Donovan, et al.,1981.Classification of the Jurassic Ammonitina, in The Ammonoidea, M.R House & J.R. Senior, (eds), Academic Press recognized Spaerocoaeloceras as a hammatoceratid rather than a dactyloceratid as in the Treatise. Zurcheriinae, Hyatt 1900, includes Zurcheria, H.Douville, 1885, Haplopleuroceras, Malladaites, and Spinammatoceras. Zurcheria and Haploleuroceras are included in the Sonniniidae in the Treatise Part L. ==Evolution and Phylogeny== The Hammatoceratidae with its four subfamilies has its origin in the Phymatoceratidae, with the subfamily Hammatoceratinae giving rise to the subfamilies Erycitinae and Podagrosiceratinae. If Zurcheria and Haploleurocesas belong in the Sonniniidae, the Zurcheriinae must thereby be derived and therefore belongs to the Sonniniidae. ==References== Category:Ammonitida families Category:Hildoceratoidea Category:Jurassic ammonites Category:Early Jurassic first appearances Category:Middle Jurassic extinctions ","title":"Hammatoceratidae"},{"id":"46814523","text":"Gaius Julius Iulus was the first of the ancient patrician gens Julia to attain the consulship, which he held in 489 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 656, 657. ==Family== According to legend, the Julii were one of the noble houses that came to Rome from Alba Longa when that city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome, but it was not until the twenty-first year of the Republic that a member of that family was elected consul. Iulus' filiation is not found in the surviving fragments of the Fasti Capitolini.Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, vol. I, p. 16. If he was the father of the same Gaius Julius Iulus who was consul in 482 BC, then his father's name was Lucius. This is the interpretation given in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, which generally follows Wilhelm Drumann's scholarship on the Julii. However, in The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, Broughton gives Gaius as the father of the consul of 489.Broughton, vol. I, p. 18. If Iulus was the father of Gaius, the consul of 482, then he was also the father of Vopiscus Julius Iulus, consul in 473, who shares the same filiation and must have been the younger Gaius' brother.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 23, 29. As far as can be determined from their filiations, all of the later Julii Iuli who appear in history were descended from these two brothers. At least some classical scholars believe that the later Julii Caesares may also be descended from this family.Griffin, p. 13. ==Career== Iulus was consul in 489 BC with Publius Pinarius Mamercinus Rufus. According to Dionysius, it was during their year of office that the Volscian leader Attius Tullius provoked a confrontation with Rome. With the help of the Roman exile Coriolanus, the Volsci prepared for war and began raiding Latin territory. As planned, the impact of the Volscian operations fell more heavily on the poor, exacerbating the already tense relationship between the patricians and the plebeians.Dionysius, viii. 1–13.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Coriolanus\\", 26–28.Livy, ii. 37, 38. As the Senate was trying to calm the populace, a Volscian force under Coriolanus took control of the city of Circeii, where there was a Roman colony. The consuls were directed to set a watch over the city, call upon Rome's allies for help, and begin raising an army to meet the Volscian threat, but their term of office expired before these tasks could be completed. Their successors, Spurius Nautius Rutilus and Sextus Furius Medullinus Fusus, continued preparing for the inevitable confrontation with Coriolanus.Dionysius, viii. 14–16.Livy, ii. 39.Broughton, vol. I, p. 19. ==FootnotesSee also== *Julia (gens) ==ReferencesBibliography== * Titus Livius (Livy), Ab Urbe Condita (History of Rome). * Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Romaike Archaiologia. * Plutarchus, Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans. * William Berry, Genealogia Antiqua, or Mythological and Classical Tables, Compiled from the Best Authors on Fabulous and Ancient History, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, London (1816). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1849). * T.

He was the first president of the Directory of the Republic. After leaving politics he moved to Alsace, where he ran his manufacturing business on philanthropic lines. ==Early years== Johann Lukas Legrand was born in Basel on 30 May 1755. He was the son of Daniel Legrand, a civil judge and deputy to the Grand Council. Johann Lukas married Rosina Lindenmeyer in 1780. He was educated as a pietist at Chur, then studied philosophy and theology in Basel, Leipzig and Göttingen. In Leipzig he was influenced by the Swiss preacher Georg Joachim Zollikofer. He met Christian Gottlob Heyne and adopted the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He traveled to Holland, France and England to round out his education. He discovered the free views of an enlightened Christianity, and decided to abandon his career in the church. Legrand returned to Basel in 1779, where he took over the manufacture of silk ribbons. He became a member of the Society for Public Benevolence and Utility, and founder and president of the Reading Society. He was a member of the canton's council in 1783. He was given responsibility for the Basel education system, and worked on reforming the Basel Gymnasium along the lines of the German reformers Johann Bernhard Basedow and Joachim Heinrich Campe. ==Revolutionary period== In 1792 Legrand became Landvogt of Riehen. In this role, on 26 December 1795 he received the French deputies who had been released from Austrian captivity in exchange for Marie Thérèse, daughter of Louis XVI of France. He became increasingly affected by the ideas of the French Revolution; and joined the small circle of young men in Basel led by Colonel Peter Ochs who wanted to forestall a French military invasion by a peaceful constitutional amendment in the Canton of Basel, which they achieved early in 1798. During the Basel revolution Legrand led the progressive forces and avoided bloodshed. On 12 April 1798 the Helvetic Republic was proclaimed in Aarau, Legrand was chosen as first president of the Directory that governed the republic. Later he became disillusioned with the brutality and rapacity of the French, with whom the Helvetic Republic was allied, and the sacrifices they demanded. He resigned on 19 January 1799 and left politics altogether. ==Later career== After the Act of Mediation of 19 February 1803 established the Swiss Confederation Legrand belonged to the Council of Basel for a short period. He moved his factory in 1804 to the old convent of Saint-Morand, near Altkirch, Alsace. From 1812 he lived in Fouday, Alsace near to the parish of Johann Friedrich Oberlin. He became known for his philanthropic activities. He built schoolhouses and orphanages, and promoted the spread of the Bible through missionary societies. He let his sons run the manufacturing operation, which was largely a home industry. Johann Lukas Legrand died in Fouday on 4 October 1836. His son Daniel Legrand, who continued the ribbon factory, was also a philanthropist. Daniel promoted French legislation on child labor in factories, and inspired the later international laws for worker's protection. ==Publications== * * ==ReferencesSources== * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Swiss businesspeople Category:Helvetic Republic Category:1755 births Category:1836 deaths Category:People from Basel-Stadt Category:18th-century Swiss businesspeople Category:19th-century Swiss businesspeople Category:19th- century Swiss politicians ","title":"Johann Lukas Legrand"},{"id":"46814538","text":"The 2013–14 Northern Ireland Football League was the first season of Northern Ireland's national football league running independently as the Northern Ireland Football League, consisting of the top three levels of the national league system, namely: the Premiership, Championship 1, and Championship 2.

The effect is prominent in cyanobacteria, whereby the phycobilisome light-harvesting antenna complexes alter their preference for transfer of excitation energy between the two reaction centers, PS I and PS II. This shift helps to minimize photodamage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stressful conditions such as high light, but may also be used to offset imbalances between the rates of generating reductant and ATP. The phenomenon was first discovered in unicellular green algae, and may also occur in plants. However, in these organisms it occurs by a different mechanism, which is not as well understood. The plant/algal mechanism is considered functionally analogous to the cyanobacterial mechanism but involves completely different components. The foremost difference is the presence of fundamentally different types of light- harvesting antenna complexes: plants and green algae use an intrinsically- bound membrane complex of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins for their antenna, instead of the soluble phycobilisome complexes used by cyanobacteria (and certain algae). ==References== Category:Biochemistry ","title":"Photosynthetic state transition"},{"id":"46814590","text":"Royal Air Force Church Fenton or RAF Church Fenton was a former Royal Air Force (RAF) station located south east of Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England and north west of Selby, North Yorkshire, near the village of Church Fenton. The station was opened in 1937 and during the Second World War was home to air defence aircraft, a role retained by the station until the 1960s when it became a training station. It closed in 2013 and is now a civilian airfield known as Leeds East Airport. == History  Prewar === Plans for a new airfield adjacent to the village of Church Fenton were announced in June 1935, it was subject to protest from the local population particularly concerning the waste of valuable farming land and was close to an existing airfield away at Sherburn. Despite the protests construction started in early 1936 on the site, a mixture of private and West Riding County Council-owned farm land. On 1 April 1937 the station was declared open and on 19 April the first station commander Wing Commander W.E. Swann assumed command. Within two months No. 71 Squadron RAF had arrived with the Gloster Gladiator. === Second World War === Opened in 1937, it saw the peak of its activity during the years of the Second World War, when it served within the defence network of fighter bases of the RAF providing protection for the Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield and Humberside industrial regions. During September 1940 it became home to the first RAF \\"Eagle squadron\\" of American volunteers being No. 71 Squadron RAF initially with the Brewster Buffalo I for one month before changing to the Hawker Hurricane I. The airfield was also home to both the first all-Canadian and all-Polish squadrons, with No. 242 Squadron RAF for the Canadians and No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron for the Polish. 242 Squadron, first established in the First World War and then disbanded, was re-formed here in October 1939, using Canadian personnel. As technologies evolved, No. 54 Operational Training Unit (54 OTU) was formed at Church Fenton in 1940, the first night fighter OTU, staying until 1942. Some of the squadrons stationed there also flew the de Havilland Mosquito. The following squadrons were billeted at Church Fenton at various times: === Postwar === After the war it at first retained its role as a fighter base, being among the first to receive modern jet aircraft, namely the Gloster Meteor and the Hawker Hunter. Between October 1950 and March 1957 it was the base of No. 609 Squadron RAF, within the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and named \\"West Riding\\". The unit was equipped with Gloster Meteors. In later years, its role was mainly flight training. No. 7 Flying Training School RAF was based here between 1962 and 1966 and again between 1979 and 1992, equipped with Hunting Aircraft Jet Provost T3 trainers. For some years it was home to the Royal Navy Elementary Flying Training School (RNEFTS) using the Scottish Aviation Bulldog, and again 1979-1992, triggered by the introduction of the Panavia Tornado, being the first station to receive the new turboprop-powered Short Tucano T.1 basic fast jet trainers. From 1998-2003 Church Fenton was the RAF's main Elementary Flying Training airfield. The following squadrons were also posted here at some point: * 19, 23, 41, 72, 85. * 112, 129, 141. * 257, 263, 264. === 2003–2013 === On 25 March 2013 it was announced that Church Fenton would close by the end of 2013. The units would be relocated to RAF Linton-on-Ouse by 31 December 2013. By 19 December 2013, all units had relocated and the airfield was closed. Some equipment will be relocated to RAF Topcliffe. MoD security continued to secure the site until disposal. A NOTAM was issued suspending the air traffic zone (ATZ) at the end of 2013. == Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron and ATC == The station was home to Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron and it is from there that they used to conduct their flying training in the Grob Tutor Aircraft. Much of the station is now derelict and fenced off and the Officers Mess has been demolished. The airside section of the station is closed with various hangars incorporating YUAS’s aircraft, engineering support, fire/ambulance facilities and a sports hangar. The station used to have a fully functioning and manned Air Traffic Control Tower. The Station headquarters remains and used to incorporate YUAS’s administration, presentation and social facilities. There was a canteen facility known as the \\"Feeder\\" and a basic accommodation block. Yorkshire UAS ceased operations at RAF Church Fenton on 19 December 2013, following the closure of the airfield. == Current use == The airfield is now known as Leeds East Airport and is also home to 2434 (Church Fenton) Squadron Air Training Corps. The site was sold on 23 December 2014 to Makins Yorkshire Strawberries with the exception of a section containing the Air Cadets. Makins intends to keep the airfield operational. In February 2015, Makins Enterprises (the new airfield owners) launched their new website, renaming the airfield. It will now be known as 'Leeds East Airport', with the slogan \\"Yorkshire's newest aviation destination.\\" It is believed that Makins Enterprises will target the business jet market, while also running a flying school and other ventures. The second series of the ITV drama Victoria was shot at a hangar onsite in 2017. === Current operational units === * 2434 (Church Fenton) Squadron Air Training Corps == See also == * List of former Royal Air Force stations == References Citations=Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * A brief and detailed history of RAF Church Fenton Category:Royal Air Force stations in Yorkshire Category:Buildings and structures in North Yorkshire Category:Airports in England Category:Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 1937 ","title":"RAF Church Fenton"},{"id":"46814605","text":"GKS Płomień Milowice was the volleyball section of the same name multi-sports club from Poland, located in the city of Sosnowiec.

Emojipedia also publishes articles and provides tools for tracking new emoji characters, design changes and usage trends. Emojipedia is a voting member of The Unicode Consortium and has been called \\"the world's number one resource on emoji\\". ==History== Jeremy Burge created Emojipedia in 2013, and told the Hackney Gazette \\"the idea came about when Apple added emojis to iOS 6, but failed to mention which ones were new\\". Emojipedia rose to prominence with the release of Unicode 7 in 2014, when The Register reported the \\"online encyclopedia of emojis has been chucked offline after vast numbers of people visited the site\\" in relation to the downtime experienced by the site at the time. In 2015, Emojipedia entered its first partnership with Quartz to release an app that allowed users access previously-hidden country flag emojis on iOS. Emojipedia told Business Insider in early-2016 that it served \\"over 140 million page views\\" per year, and was profitable. In mid-2016, Emojipedia \\"urged Apple to rethink its plan to convert the handgun emoji symbol into a water pistol icon\\" citing cross-platform confusion. In 2017 The Library of Congress launched the Web Cultures Web Archive which featured a history of memes, gifs, and emojis from references including Emojipedia, Boing Boing and GIPHY. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the site served 23 million page views in October 2017. Total page views for 2013–2019 were said to have reached one billion by February 2019. The New Yorker reported Emojipedia served 50 million page views in April 2020. == News and Analysis == In 2016 an Emojipedia analysis showed that the peach emoji is most commonly used to represent buttocks. In 2017, after Google CEO Sundar Pichai pledged to “drop everything” to update Android's burger emoji, Emojipedia revealed the cheese layering issue had been resolved. In 2018 Emojipedia revealed that Apple planned to “fix” its bagel emoji design by adding cream cheese, following user complaints. A 2020 study by Emojipedia found that and were most used to represent COVID-19. Also in 2020, Emojipedia revealed that Apple's forthcoming iOS update would change the mask-wearing emoji to display a smiling face. ==World Emoji Day== World Emoji Day is a holiday created by Emojipedia in 2014 which is held on 17 July each year. According to the New York Times, 17 July was chosen due to the design of the calendar emoji (on iOS) showing this date. Emojipedia used the second annual World Emoji Day to release EmojiVote as \\"an experiment in Emoji democracy\\". In 2017–2020, Apple used this event to preview new emojis for iOS. Emojipedia reveals the winners of the World Emoji Awards each year, with past announcements held live at the New York Stock Exchange and National Museum of Cinema. ==Adopt an Emoji== Emojipedia launched Adopt an Emoji in September 2015 as \\"an attempt to make the site free of display ads\\" according to Wired. This preceded a similar program by the Unicode Consortium in December 2015. The Emojipedia \\"Adopt an Emoji\\" program was shut down in November 2016, citing confusion for users and advertisers due to the similarity with Unicode's fundraising effort. == Cultural impact == Emojipedia's images for future emoji designs have been used as the source of jokes in opening monologues on late night television shows such as The Daily Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In 2018, Portland Maine's Press Herald reported that Senator Angus King had endorsed a new lobster emoji but Emojipedia's design was called out as \\"anatomically incorrect\\" due to an incorrect number of legs. The number of legs on Emojipedia's lobster design was subsequently fixed in a future release. Slate reported this as \\"a victory for scientists and lobster fans everywhere\\".

On BBC Radio 4, Stephen Fry described Emojipedia as \\"a kind of Académie française for your iPhone\\" when assessing its impact on the English language. == Legal precedent == In 2018, Emojipedia was presented in the Federal Court of Australia as \\"a reputable website in telling us how to interpret these faces\\" by a lawyer for Geoffrey Rush during a defamation case against Nationwide News. This was in the context of interpreting an emoji sent by Rush to a fellow actor, which Rush described as \\"the looniest emoji I could find\\". Rush said he would have used an emoji of Groucho Marx or the Muppets' Fozzie Bear if they had been available. Reports indicate Rush's lawyer \\"attempted to hand up to Justice Michael Wigney a printout of the emoji's meaning from Emojipedia\\" but a barrister for Nationwide News objected, stating it \\"doesn't matter what Emojipedia says the emoji is\\".

The oldest synagogue in South Bend, it is also thought to be \\"America's only ballpark synagogue.\\" In 2012 the unused synagogue was renovated and reopened as a gift shop for the South Bend Cubs minor league baseball team, whose ballpark abuts the property. The synagogue was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. ==History== The modest synagogue was built in 1901 by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. The congregation was Orthodox for most of its history; in 1982 it became a Reconstructionist temple and was renamed B'nai Yisrael. After some years of declining attendance in a neighborhood that continued to deteriorate despite renewal efforts, including construction of a minor league ballpark adjacent to the synagogue, the last services were held in the building in 1990. It was then was donated to the Indiana Landmarks Foundation. In 2005, the Foundation sold the synagogue to Chris Wood for use as a residence; however the city decided to use the building or the land it stood on as part of its urban renewal efforts and bought the building from Wood in 2007 for $130,000. Plans to use the building as a museum, or to move it to a new location, fell through due to lack of funds, and the building stood neglected and deteriorating for several years. In 2012 Andrew T. Berlin, new owner of the South Bend Cubs baseball team, purchased the synagogue and funded a $1-million renovation. Berlin paid for restoration, including a refurbishment of the building's handsome brass chandelier, and for new wall paintings combining biblical and baseball themes. A mural of Noah's Ark is captioned \\"Rain Delay\\", and a copy of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel shows God's hand encased in a baseball glove as he hands a baseball to Adam. The caption reads: \\"Play Ball.\\" The preserved building stands on the grounds of Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium, where it serves as the Cubs' team gift shop. A short film about the restoration of the synagogue won a 2013 Emmy Award. ===Criticism=== Robert Nevel, a Chicago architect who attended the synagogue as a boy, told a reporter that the reuse of the bimah, a central platform from which the Torah is read, as the location of the cash register felt like a kind of \\"accidental symbolism\\", almost a \\"sardonic commentary\\" on the idea that Jews worship money, and that the design of the access ramp had \\"mucked up\\" the building's stone base, a distinguishing feature of early Chicago style architecture. ==Architecture== The -story structure was designed in Romanesque Revival style. Finished in orange-brick limestone, it has a gabled roof topped by a large stone arch trimmed in white. Its three tall front windows are arched at the top and square at the bottom; a white metal panel with a design of pressed arches separates the top and bottom of each window. The name of the synagogue is engraved above the center window at the base of another arch-shaped design, with an oculus window at the center. On either corner of the front facade is a square brick tourelle with a corbelled base; each tourelle is topped by a pyramid-shaped metal roof with a Star of David finial. The interior design includes a main sanctuary with a balcony for female worshippers, several smaller rooms, and a basement that previously housed a mikveh. == References == Category:Former synagogues in Indiana Category:Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:1901 establishments in Indiana Category:Buildings and structures in South Bend, Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Joseph County, Indiana Category:Synagogues completed in 1901 ","title":"Ballpark Synagogue"},{"id":"46814658","text":"Bukarester FC was a football club from Bucharest, Romania.

Built in 1833, it was the first major commission of the noted 19th-century architect Richard Upjohn. Although it was built as a private residence, it was from 1929-72 owned by the Bangor Symphony Orchestra and was home to its music conservatory. It is now part of the Bangor YMCA. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. ==Description and history== The Farrar Mansion is set on the south side of Union Street (Maine State Route 222), at the southwest corner of 2nd Street on Bangor's west side. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, three bays wide, with a truncated hip roof pierced by steeply-pitched gable dormers. Although the styling of the building is predominantly Greek Revival, it has a number of Colonial Revival alterations from the early 20th century, including its front portico and the bay window above. Design of the house was commissioned by Isaac Farrar, a successful businessman who came to Bangor in 1836. It was the first major commission given to Richard Upjohn, whose early successes in Maine made possible his extensive career as one of the leading architects of the mid-19th century. The house shows that Upjohn was well conversant in the Greek Revival, although his best-known works are Gothic Revival. The house was a private residence until 1911, at which time it was acquired by the University of Maine Law School, which used it as a residency until 1929. In 1929 the Bangor Symphony Orchestra purchased the property, renamed it \\"Symphony House\\", and operated the Northern Conservatory of Music on the premises, also hosting the music branch of the Bangor Public Library. In 1972 the school closed, and the symphony sold the building the following year to the local YMCA, which now uses it as an exhibit and reception space. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Penobscot County, Maine ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Greek Revival houses in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1833 Category:Houses in Bangor, Maine Category:Richard Upjohn buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bangor, Maine Category:YMCA buildings in the United States ","title":"Isaac Farrar Mansion"},{"id":"46814689","text":"The 2014–15 Northern Ireland Football League was the second season of Northern Ireland's national football league running independently as the Northern Ireland Football League, consisting of the top three levels of the national league system, namely: the Premiership, Championship 1, and Championship 2.

An odd blend of sophistication, of Gallic outspokenness, with a simplicity, almost a naivete, makes this unique in its field. Beautifully translated by Eithne Wilkins, the English text loses nothing of the grace of language.\\" ==Adaptation== The novel was adapted into a 1980 television serial with the same title directed by Louis Grospierre. The serial ran in four episodes starring Jacques Penot as Jean, Florence Pernel as Marie and Daniel Gélin as Bazalo. ==References== Category:1946 French novels Category:French novels adapted into films Category:French-language novels Category:Novels by René Barjavel Category:Hamish Hamilton books ","title":"The Tragic Innocents"},{"id":"46814932","text":"3'-Hydroxyechinenone is a keto-carotenoid pigment found in cyanobacteria and microalgae.

He is the founder, and chairman of Total Environment Building Systems, Founder and Chairman, Total Environment Hospitality (Windmills Craftworks). ==Early life== Kamal graduated from IIT Kharagpur in 1992, with a degree in Architecture. After a short stint with Omni Architects at Lexington, Kentucky, in the US, he returned to India and designed the Poonawalla Stud Farms at Hadapsar and Theur, Pune, and also built them out in a span of just 8 months, in time for the Asian Racing Conference by Asian Racing Federation on 27 January 1995. At the farms, he extensively used exposed brick masonry, sourced from the state of Kerala, evolving a special technique with the help of steel spacers to bring out the character of every individual brick – in line with his core design philosophy of natural exteriors for all his buildings, to help them blend with the natural landscape. He believed that natural materials had more character, brought the building to life and aged gracefully unlike artificial materials, which did not change with time. ==Career== Kamal moved to Bangalore in 1995, and after working for 4 months with Mistry Architects, started his architectural practice, first in his own name, and then, in the name of Shibanee & Kamal Architects, along with wife and partner, Shibanee In 1996, in his search for a one-bedroom apartment, he realized just how bad the state of large scale housing projects was, and saw tremendous scope to make a difference in this area. After several failed attempts in trying to get Developers to accept his design ideas, he decided to take on the task of developing and constructing his projects himself, and not just designing them and founded Total Environment, a construction and real estate development company, that would build out his designs without compromise. Total Environment has since, built 2.5 million square feet of high quality, individually customized and furnished space, mostly homes, across Bangalore and Pune. Leading through design and a combination of technology & craftsmanship, each Total Environment home is a sensitively detailed, high- quality space that celebrates nature by embracing it. Kamal’s work has always been inspired by music and art. He founded Windmills Craftworks, in 2012, a Jazz Theatre, Microbrewery and Restaurant, where the audience is able to experience great talent at close quarters, with exceptional sound quality and in a beautiful, warm and comfortable setting and with some of the best beer and food in Bangalore. In less than two years, Windmills Craftworks soon established itself as the best live music venue in Bangalore, bringing path breaking music ranging from Jazz, Blues, rock, folk, Bluegrass, Indian Classical music, Indian folk music and Latin. ==Work== The Magic Faraway Tree, Kanakapura Road, Bangalore The Good Earth, Ulsoor, Bangalore Section of the terrace garden The Magic Faraway Tree, Kanakapura Road, Bangalore Windmills of Your Mind, Whitefield, Bangalore Kamal’s work has focused on mostly on creating warm spaces and a high quality experience in high-rise housing projects, through homes that embrace nature. He was surprised to see how people all over the world could build large housing projects where homes did not have gardens – he felt that a garden was a very basic human need. Kamal introduced the idea of a garden with every home. Referred as Gardens in the Sky. In 1996, at his project Green is the Colour, Bangalore, he created gardens cantilevering in alternate directions on consecutive floors. When his customers refused to pay for these gardens, he decided to go ahead and provide them at his own cost. Over the years, he experimented with various different formats for these gardens, with most rooms in each apartment, opening onto these gardens through large wood frame sliding glass panels. Kamal also believed that the furniture in a home is integral to the planning and layout of the home and cannot be excluded from the scope of the design of the home and, from 2002, started designing and building most of his homes as completely furnished homes. He also developed a software platform through which he brought design to every single home buyer – a platform that allows a home- buyer to individually customize every detail of his house – from wall layouts and furniture layouts to materials and finishes – down to the detail of the shelving in the wardrobes. ==Projects== 1995 Poonawalla Stud Farms, Hadpsar, Pune, India 1999 Ion Idea Corporate Campus, Whitefield, Bangalore, India 2000 Bougainvillea, Vibhuthipura, Bangalore, India 2000 Green is the Colour, BTM Layout, Bangalore, India 2001 The Good Earth, Ulsoor, Bangalore, India 2001 Webb India Limited – Corporate Office & workshops, Bommasandra, Bangalore, India 2004 Shine On, Rahath Bagh, Bangalore, India 2004 Time, Indiranagar, Bangalore, India 2006 Footprints, Indiranagar, Bangalore, India 2006 Residence for Navin Dhananjay, Hennur Road, Bangalore, India 2008 Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore, India 2009 Orange Blossom Special, Uday Baugh, Pune, India 2010 Greensleeves, Singasandra, Bangalore, India 2015 Windmills of Your Mind, Whitefield, Bangalore, India 2015 The Magic Faraway Tree, Phase 1, Kanakapura Road, Bangalore, India 2015 Learning to Fly ==Awards and recognition== In recognition of his work, Kamal has won several Architectural Design Awards - at both National and International levels – including the award for the Best Residential Architecture – Asia Pacific Region, and Best Residential Development, India 2009 from CNBC, as well as Most Innovative Design, 2013 from CREDAI Karnataka, for his project Windmills of Your Mind, Habitat Award for Apartment Planning from A+D Spectrum Foundation, for Time, 2005, Best Group Housing Project from JK Cements Architect of the Year Awards and Habitat Award for Apartment Planning, from A+D Spectrum Foundation, 2003, for The Good Earth {  - !

The Centre was founded by Alfred Wolfsohn in Berlin during 1935 and re-situated in London during 1943, where he and his contemporaries and successors developed principles and practices that provided the foundations for the use of an extended vocal technique. This technique allows vocalists to extend their vocal range and flexibility beyond that usually heard in speech or song.Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed.

New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65. The Centre inspired, precipitated, and influenced a number of developments within the arts, the expressive therapies, and psychotherapy, including the Roy Hart Theatre, founded by Roy Hart, the psychotherapeutic approach to song, prayer, and guided meditation evolved by Paul Newham, the clinical application of singing and nonverbal vocalization in music therapy and drama therapy, and the use of spontaneous vocal expression in dance movement therapy.Martin, J., Voice in Modern Theatre.

In addition, the extended vocal technique developed at the Centre has been used by performers in avant garde theatre, experimental music, and postmodern dance including: Eight Songs for a Mad King composed by Peter Maxwell Davies and performed by Roy Hart, Akropolis (1962) directed by Jerzy Grotowski, Orghast (1971) directed by Peter Brook, and House of Bones (1991) by Motionhouse with vocal music composed and performed using extended vocal technique by Paul Newham.Curtin, A., 'Alternative Vocalities: Listening Awry to Peter Maxwell Davies's Eight Songs for a Mad King'.

This common ground comprised two elements. Firstly, a commitment to the principles of Analytical Psychology, established by Carl Jung, with particular attention to Active Imagination technique. Secondly, an intention to establish a form of extended vocal technique that would enable vocalists to develop a highly flexible vocal range capable of expressing a broad spectrum of emotions and characters, for both therapeutic and artistic application.Shepard, L., An Empirical Therapy Based on an Extension of Vocal Range and Expression in Singing and Drama. Paper read at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy, London, August 1964. Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives.

London: Random House 1993 and Boston: Shambhala 1994.Newham, P., 'Jung and Alfred Wolfsohn: Analytical Psychology and the Singing Voice. Journal of Analytical Psychology 37. 1992 pp323-336. ===Phase 1: 1935 - 1939=== The first phase of the Centre spans from 1935 - 1939 in Berlin. In 1914, Alfred Wolfsohn was conscripted to military service, and after discharge became disturbed by auditory hallucinations of vocal sounds that he had heard wounded and dying soldiers make. He was subsequently diagnosed with Shell Shock, and after failing to benefit from psychiatry, hypnosis, and medication, cured himself by vocalizing the extreme sounds he had heard and hallucinated.Newham, P., The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London. Tigers Eye Press 1997. In 1935, Wolfsohn met the opera singer Paula Salomon-Lindberg, who offered him lodging and a job teaching singing to those she described as her less gifted pupils. During this time, Wolfsohn began to develop an approach to vocal pedagogy that his pupils reported to be therapeutic. This phase was characterized by Wolfsohn's experiments, conducted with two student groups. The first comprised those who came for lessons initially intending to improve their professional singing proficiency, but who became increasingly motivated to attend because of the therapeutic benefits they experienced. The second group were those who came originally and entirely for therapeutic purposes, without any intention to sing publicly. Salomon-Lindberg, P., interviewed by Mary Löwenthal Felstiner, Amsterdam, 23–26 March 1984; 15–20 April 1985; 6–8 July 1988; 14 July 1993.Salomon-Lindberg, P., interviewed by Franz Weisz, Amsterdam, 1981.

Paula Salomon-Lindberg did not believe that Wolfsohn's techniques were suitable for training professional singers, and criticized his approach. However, she acknowledged that his pupils appeared to find his lessons effective in helping them overcome inhibitions and experience an emotional release that Wolfsohn described as cathartic.Salomon-Lindberg, P., interviewed by Mary Löwenthal Felstiner, Amsterdam, 23–26 March 1984; 15–20 April 1985; 6–8 July 1988; 14 July 1993.

During this phase, Wolfsohn made notes about his experiences during the war, his views about the capacity of the human voice to extend beyond the range commonly heard in speech and song, and the impact of his lessons upon those he taught. These notes evolved in a manuscript called 'Orpheus, oder der Weg zu einer Maske'.Coghlan, B., 'The Human Voice and the Aural Vision of the Soul'.

During the early part of this phase, Wolfsohn believed that Sigmund Freud's notion of catharsis was the most appropriate framework within which to situate and by which to explain the therapeutic effects of his teaching. During the second part of this phase, Wolfsohn began to discover the theories of Carl Jung, as he simultaneously grew more confident in his own vocal teaching.Shepard, L., interviewed by Paul Newham, Dublin, 1990. Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives. Curated by Paul Newham, London.Günther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn'. Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture 50. 1990 pp65–75. Consequently, Wolfsohn began to focus less on facilitating in his students an emotional release or catharsis through the voice, and more on helping them give vocal expression to mental imagery, including the characters and animals that they reported encountering in their dreams.

Smithsonian Institution 1983. ===Phase 2: 1943 - 1956 === The second phase of the Centre spans from 1943 - 1956 in London. In 1939, Wolfsohn escaped Nazi Germany, and re-established his Centre in London during 1943, after receiving permission from the British Government to work as a singing teacher. Few of the pupils who attended the Centre during this phase had ambitions to sing professionally or publicly, and almost all of them attended and took singing lessons with Wolfsohn in order to experience therapeutic benefits. Among such students was Rabbi Lionel Blue whose personal reasons for attending the Centre are emblematic of those that motivated many other attendants: > I knew that there was a whole dimension of me that I had never had an > opportunity to express: emotions or feelings, or maybe instincts. I also > felt quite inhibited a lot of the time, though I was reasonably good at > hiding my shyness. It was as though the 'full me' wanted to break out, and I > knew this 'me' was never going to emerge through talking. So when I heard of > his [Wolfsohn's] approach to singing, it immediately appealed to me, and > though I only went for a short period of time, it helped enormously. It gave > me confidence in other areas of my life.Blue, L., 'Interview with Paul > Newham'. London October 1996. Cited in 'The Prophet of Song: The Life and > Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. Tigers Eye Press. 1997. Whilst some students, like Blue, attended for a short period, often for one singing lesson per week over several months, others spent entire days at the Centre, having singing lessons and observing others. These included Jenny Johnson, whose voice typified for Wolfsohn what he believed was possible for every human voice trained in his approach to extended vocal technique. Under Wolfsohn's tutelage, Jenny Johnson developed a vocal range of almost 6 octaves,Luchsinger, R. and Dubois, C.L., 'Phonetische und stroboskopische Untersüchungen an einem Stimmphänomen', Folia Phoniatrica, 8: No. 4, pp201–210. Trans. Ian Halcrow. 1956. as well as a flexibility of timbre that allowed her to give dramatic expression to many different characters, and to sing parts from operas written for Soprano, Tenor, Baritone, and Bass.Waterhouse, J.

Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives. Curated by Paul Newham, London. It was during this phase that Wolfsohn re situated his teaching firmly in the principles established by Carl Jung, believing that he had discovered and developed a new component to the technique Jung called Active Imagination.Wolfsohn, A., Die Brücke. London 1947 (Manuscript). Trans. Marita Günther and Sheila Braggins. Repository: Joods Historisch Museum, Amsterdam.Günther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn'. Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture 50. 1990 pp65–75. Carl Jung claimed that the terms psyche and imagination might reasonably be used interchangeably to refer to the same source of images, claiming that every mental process involves in some way an encounter with imagery. Jung described Active Imagination as the means by which mental images are expressed and become outwardly manifest, and pointed to paintings, fairytales, myths, and religious symbolism as examples.Samuels, A., Jung and the PostJungians. London. Routledge. 1985.Stevens, A., On Jung. London. Routledge. 1990.Newham, P., 'The voice and the shadow'. Performance 60. Spring 1990 pp37-47. The regular attendants of the Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre believed that they had discovered the way in which their extended vocal technique and the resultant expressiveness of their voices could demonstrate Active Imagination through nonverbal vocal sound, giving outward acoustic expression to what Jung called 'psychic imagery'.Jung, C.G., The Collected Works of C G Jung Vol. 11 (Bollingen Series XX). H. Read, M. Fordham, G. Adler, and Wm. McGuire (eds). Princeton, New Jersey. Princeton University Press and Routledge. 1953 pp325-6 and p544. The Centre's attempts to communicate directly with Jung failed, and the approach to vocal expression demonstrated by its attendants attracted more attention from those interested in its potential use in experimental music and theatre than in psychotherapy.Newham, P., The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London. Tigers Eye Press 1997. ===Phase 3: 1956 - 1962=== The third phase of the Centre spans from 1956 - 1962 in London. Phase 3 of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre was characterized by a concentration on exploring the artistic use of the founder's extended vocal technique, by rehearsing and presenting short demonstrations, including songs, poems, and improvised performance pieces to invited guests, including Yehudi Menuhin, Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov, Berthold Wiesner, Edward Downes, Hermann Scherche, Julian Huxley, and Aldous Huxley.Shepard, L., 'The Voice of the World', (printed notes to accompany recording, with introduction by Dr Henry Cowell), 'Vox Humana: Alfred Wolfsohn's Experiments in Extension of Human Vocal Range'.

Intrigued by what they observed, these and other invited guests publicized the work of the Centre, and as a result, some attendants made a number of public appearances and recordings.

During the latter part of this phase, Roy Hart, a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art who had started attending the Centre in 1947, began to give acting classes for actors and drama students at venues across London, appropriating and extending techniques that he had learned from Wolfsohn.Günther, M., interviewed by David Williams, Malérargues, France, February 1985. Repository: Dartington College of Arts Theatre Papers Archives, Devon.Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985. ===Phase 4: 1962 - 1974=== The fourth phase of the Centre spans from 1962 - 1974. In 1962, Wolfsohn fell ill and died in hospital. Soon afterwards, Hart announced his intent to further both the therapeutic and artistic application of the extended vocal technique derived from Wolfsohn's original research.The Mystery Behind the Voice: A Biography of Alfred Wolfsohn. London: Matador. 2012) The death of Wolfsohn precipitated a division among the attendants of the Centre which culminated in the permanent departure of some when Hart formed a theatre company during 1968-1969. He called it the Roy Hart Theatre, which comprised some actors and acting students from the classes he had been teaching around London and others who had been students of Wolfsohn at the Centre, including Marita Günther, to whom Wolfsohn bequeathed his manuscripts and personal effects.Newham, P., The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London. Tigers Eye Press 1997. Subsequently, Hart, Günther and others vacated the studio in which Wolfsohn had taught since establishing the Centre, and moved to new premises in Hampstead, taking their documentation of the Centre's work with them, where they rehearsed a number of pieces subsequently performed at theatres, including Eight Songs for a Mad King, especially written for Hart by Peter Maxwell Davies. Meanwhile, the remaining attendants who did not join Hart's theatre company, including Jenny Johnson, her sister Jill Johnson, Irene Landry, and Leslie Shepard, remained for a short time before dispersing, taking with them their photographic, phonographic, and written documentation of the work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre.Newham, P., The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London. Tigers Eye Press 1997. ===Phase 5 - 1962 - 1985=== The fifth phase of the Centre spans from 1962 - 1985. Between 1962 and 1992, the Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre, which had hitherto been physically located at a single place, first in Berlin, and later London, became dispersed, as some of the original attendants of the London Centre, who had not joined Hart's theatre company, sought to collaborate, continuing and consolidating work begun by Alfred Wolfsohn. This posed a considerable challenge, as they were dispersed across the United States, Europe and the UK. Among them was the archivist Leslie Shepard, who collected and curated many recordings, photographs, and written documentation produced by the dispersed Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre attendants at a private archive in Dublin, Ireland, whilst seeking funding to re-establish the Centre, and lease the archive materials to museums. Meanwhile, the documentation possessed by attendants of the Centre who were now part of the Roy Hart Theatre, was archived at Malérargues, in the South of France, when the Roy Hart Theatre moved there in 1974. At the same time, Marita Günther deposited some of Wolfsohn's writings and manuscripts that she had inherited with the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam.Newham, P., The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London. Tigers Eye Press 1997. After Roy Hart died in a car accident in 1974, his company continued to teach voice classes and tour both experimental music pieces and dramatic productions that used an extended vocal range, developed by applying techniques established by Wolfsohn, and extended by Hart. Meanwhile, the remaining attendants of the Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre toured museums, colleges, and universities, with demonstrations and archive documentation of Wolfsohn's life and work.Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2–7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985. ===Phase 6: 1985 - 1999=== The sixth phase of the Centre spans from 1985 - 1999. In 1985, Paul Newham, a graduate of Drama Centre, and Dartington College of Arts, took voice lessons with Enrique Pardo, a member of the Roy Hart Theatre who had never met Wolfsohn, but trained with Hart. Newham subsequently sought to adapt the techniques he learned from Pardo to promote the creativity and self- expression of nonverbal young adults with a range of disabilities that prevented them from speaking but who nonetheless were able to make a range of vocal sounds. The following year, while working as director of Libre Theatre Company in Oxford, a drama troupe that includes disabled performers, Newham began locating attendants of the Centre, who had studied with Alfred Wolfsohn, including those who had dispersed after his death, and the ones now part of the Roy Hart Theatre.Newham, P., The Singing Cure: An Introduction to Voice Movement Therapy. London: Random House, 1993 and Boston: Shambhala, 1994. The Roy Hart Theatre company dissolved in 1989 when it was apparent that its members had established their own distinct and discreet work, most notably the experimental arts and cultural project Pan Theatre established by Enrique Pardo in 1981 with collaborative contributions from its honorary president James Hillman.Pardo, E. 'Pan Theatre Information'. Web Publication: Pan Theatre Online . With the assistance of Leslie Shepard, Marita Günther, the Jewish Historical Museum, the British Academy, and the Ferens Institute Voice Clinic at the Middlesex Hospital, Newham researched a variety of extended vocal techniques, studied the aggregate archives of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre, including the founder's manuscripts, and re-establish it in Redchurch Street, East London. Newham subsequently extended the techniques pioneered at the Centre to formulate a therapeutic methodology drawing upon guided meditation and ideokinesis incorporating prayer as well as song, whilst contextualizing these developments in the tenets descendant from the Analytical Psychology established by Jung.Newham, P. Therapeutic Voicework: Principles and Practice for the Use of Singing as a Therapy. London, Jessica Kingsley Publishers 1998. Having been renamed the London Voice Centre by Paul Newham, it closed in 1999 when he left and some graduates of its programs established a US-based school with the aim of continuing his teachings.International Association for Voice Movement Therapy Online Information. ===Legacy and Influence=== The influence of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre remains evident across discreet disciplines as a result of the diverse ways in which its attendants have inherited and adapted the work initiated by its German founder in 1935.

He was the son of the schoolmaster of Niedernhall near Oehringen in Württemberg. From his earliest childhood he showed such a passion and aptitude for music that his father apprenticed him in his twelfth year to the musical director (Stadtmusikus) of the neighbouring town of Künzelsau. During this time he devoted himself chiefly to the practice of the cello, at which, under the influence of a most exacting master, he worked with such diligence as, it is said, permanently to injure his health. In 1789 his term of apprenticeship came to an end, and the following year he took his first regular engagement at Wertheim, where his uncle, Friedrich Adam Arnold, was established as musical director. He continued to study with unabated energy. After making concert tours in Switzerland and Germany, he spent some time at Ratisbon in order to take advantage of the instruction of the able cellist Willmann. Making constant improvement, he visited Berlin and Hamburg, at which latter town he had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of Bernard Romberg, whose style and method he studied to great advantage. In 1799 he became attached to the theatre at Frankfurt as first cellist, where he occupied himself much with composition, and enjoyed a great reputation both as executant and teacher. The career however of this young and talented artist was speedily cut short, for he died of an affection of the lungs in 1806 at the early age of thirty-four. Besides compositions and 'transcriptions' for his own particular instrument, he wrote original pieces for the flute and piano, and made quartet arrangements of various operas, etc. Fétis ('Biographie') gives a list of his compositions, including five concertos for the violoncello; a symphonic concertante for two flutes and orchestra; airs with variations, op. 9 (Bonn); and easy pieces for the guitar. ==NotesReferences== * == Sources == * J.

His New York City studio photographed over 350,000 persons. == Early life == Rockwood was born in Troy, New York, in 1832 to Elihu R. Rockwood, a hotel keeper, and Martha Gardner Burnham Rockwood. George's early education was at the Ballston Spa Institute, an elite boys' boarding school. Rockwood used to say that his mind was turned to inventions by meeting Samuel Morse when the inventor of the telegraph was exhibiting his instruments at the United States Hotel in Saratoga. Rockwood was a hallboy in the hotel at that time. Morse took a liking to the young Rockwood and took time to explain the workings of his invention. As a young adult, he worked in a printing office, and then became a reporter for the local Troy newspaper. The 1855 New York State Census lists George living in Troy with his wife Araminta, newborn daughter Mary and a female servant, with his occupation listed as restauranting. == Photography studio == He took up photography in St. Louis in 1853 and in 1858 produced the first carte de visite made in the United States. His first subject was Baron Rothschild. Mrs. August Belmont was the first woman of whom he made a vignette carte de visite. He was an inventor as well as a photographer and made many improvements in the tools of his trade. Rockwood moved to New York City in 1857 and went into partnership with his brother, Colonel Elihu R. Rockwood. The studio in which Rockwood and his brother came to be best known was in the Roosevelt Building at Broadway and 13 Street. It was in this studio that the Rockwoods met, photographed and made friends with so many of the famous men and women of their time. During the Civil War, Rockwood's brother Elihu enlisted, and George worked as a war photographer, working out of a mobile field van. His brother achieved the rank of colonel while serving with the 10th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Elihu Rockwood's army friends were frequent visitors at the Rockwood studio, and George Rockwood got to know them well. He was fond of relating his talks with Major Anderson, General Dix, and others who had taken part in the war. He knew Horace Greeley well and made several photographs of him, both in the studio and in the woods near Chappaqua where Greeley posed, axe in hand. For a short period of time in 1865 Rockwood's studio employed photographer William Kurtz, prior to his pioneering work with halftone printing. == Personal life == Rockwood married Araminta Bouton in 1853. They had several children, one of whom, George H. Rockwood, was also a photographer and associated with his father in business. Rockwood's reputation brought him a large business, but near the time of his brother Elihu's death in 1908 he filed for bankruptcy, with assets consisting of a note for $66, two patents and 514 shares \\"of no value\\". Rockwood was for many years the tenor in the quartet in Henry Ward Beecher's Plymouth Church, which included Emma Cecilia Thursby, Antoinette Sterling, and Jules Lumbert; and for 35 years he was musical director in various well-known city churches. He was a member of the National Photographers Association and the Sons of the Revolution. George Rockwood received an honorary PhD from Columbia University late in life for his contributions to the arts. Rockwood died at his country home in Lakeville, Connecticut, on July 10, 1911. ==GalleryReferencesExternal links== * Category:1832 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Photographers from New York (state) Category:People from Lakeville, Connecticut Category:People from Troy, New York Category:War photographers Category:American tenors Category:19th- century American singers Category:19th-century American photographers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"George G.

The term polonyna was introduced to English from Slavic languages, in order to designate various mountainous regions, mainly in the Eastern Carpathians, and also in the Western Carpathians. The polonyna type areas of montane meadows are very frequent in the Outer Eastern Carpathians, particularly in the Eastern Beskids. Throughout history, they were used for pasture, and in modern times they have become a popular destination for various forms of recreational tourism. The noun polonyna (plur. polonynas) and its corresponding adjectives (anglicized as polonyne or polonynian) are also used frequently in local toponyms throughout the Carpathian region. One of two main mountain ranges of the Eastern Beskids is known as the Polonyne Beskids or Polonynian Beskids (; ), and it includes several mountains that also contain the same term in their names, like: Smooth Polonyna (; ), Polonyna Borzhava (; ), Red Polonyna (; ), etc. ==See also== A montane meadow (polonyna) in Poloniny National Park, Slovakia == ReferencesSources== * * ==Further reading== * Андрій Л.

Kewda has been identified as a Geographical Indications in India. They are found between the rivers Rushikulya on the north and Bahuda on the south. It is an economically important species due to its male inflorescence which are used for the fragrant tender white spathes covering the flowers. The perfumery products including Kewda attar, Kewda water and Kewda oil (rooh Kewda) derived from this plant are. The Ganjam district of Odisha supplies about 85-90% of the India's kewda essence. Kewda grows in the 45 km x 15 km coastal belt along the Bay of Bengal. == Kewda industry in Ganjam == The kewda industry in Ganjam provides income of 4.5-6 million USD (300-400 million INR) to the local farmers. About 140 traditional distillation units operate in the small scale industries in nearly 200 villages and hamlets of the district producing an estimated 35 million flowers (3,500 tons) worth 10 million USD annually. In Odisha about 200 kilos of Rooh Kewda are prepared each year at a cost of $7000 per kilo as compared to $1500-$1800 for a fine attar. The attar contains, on the average about 3-5% essence of Kewda with the rest being sandalwood oil. When Rooh Kewda is being prepared 5 different stills are charged with 600 flowers each. Three distillations are done on one batch of flowers. It means that three receivers are assigned to each deg. The first distillate(Agari) yields 10-12 kilos of aromatic water, the second distillate(Pichari) yields the same. In the third(Tigari) liquid paraffin is sometimes kept to prepare a cheap quality \\"attar\\" or only the distillate is kept for making an inexpensive hydrosol. Only the first two distillates(Agari and Pichari) are kept for making the rooh. These are cooled down and in the evening the aromatic water is poured into one deg. It is immediately sealed and the bamboo pipe is connected to the receiver. Very gentle heat is given to the deg and about 5-6 kilos of distillate is collected in the receiver. During this time the receiver must be kept very cool and it is constantly rotated while fresh water is added four to five times.It takes about 1 hour to produce 5-6 kilos of distillate. The receiver is then hung horizontally on a wooden stand. The water is separated and the oil is collected by a special separating funnel. All of the remaining hydrosol is used in making the next batch of ruh which commences on the next day. About a thousand flowers(about 370 lbs) of flowers produces 1 ounce of Rooh Kewda. The Ruh is very very potent. It contains some of the most precious top notes of the oil which cannot even be captured effectively in an absolute. The fragrant hydrosol produced either as a primary or secondary product has many uses. It is also one of the most important flavoring agents in preparing various food items including syrups, sweets, syrups, and soft drinks.\\"Pandanus water is popular in Northern India and mainly used to flavor the fantastic sweets Indians can prepare from so commonplace ingredients as milk and sugar: rasagola (cottage cheese balls cooked in syrup), Gulab jamun (fried cottage cheese balls served with syrup) and rasmalai (cottage cheese balls in condensed milk); the latter is also sometimes prepared with saffron instead. Another application are the highly aromatic rice dishes the Moghul cuisine is famous for (biriyani, see cardamom). It is important to note that one seldom encounters a genuine kewda ruh, attar or hydrosol in the local market. The chief constituent of kewda oil is methyl ether of beta-phenylethyl alcohol(60-80%) which gives the characteristic aroma of the flowers. This aromatic component is synthesized on a large scale in India and it is widely used to produce so-called kewda products. This single constituent is readily identifiable by any person with some knowledge of perfumery, but in India, the cheapest product is often which is sold the most. There is not yet a great awareness about the difference between natural and synthetic products. The genuine oil, while containing a high percentage of the above-mentioned component contains a great number of other aromatic molecules which truly give the oil its complete profile. A simple gc/ms will easily detect this adulteration as well as show the complexity of the real oil. == References == Odisha Category:Ganjam district Category:Flavors Category:Pandanus ","title":"Ganjam Kewda Rooh"},{"id":"46815221","text":"Theodore Karamanski (born August 1, 1953) is a Professor and Historian specializing in American and Public History.

It was written in the summer of 1238 at Dōgen's monastery Kōshōhōrin-ji in Kyoto. The essay marked the beginning of a period of high output of Shōbōgenzō books that lasted until 1246. The book appears as the seventh book in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the Shōbōgenzō, and it is ordered fourth in the later chronological 95 fascicle Honzan editions. The essay is an extended commentary on the famous saying of the Tang Dynasty monk Xuansha Shibei that \\"the ten- direction world is one bright jewel\\", which in turn references the Mani Jewel metaphors of earlier Buddhist scriptures. Dōgen also discusses the \\"one bright jewel\\" and related concepts from the Shōbōgenzō essay in two of his formal Dharma Hall Discourses, namely numbers 107 and 445, as well as his Kōan commentaries 23 and 41, all of which are recorded in the Eihei Kōroku. ==The Mani Jewel== The title of the essay is often translated into English as One Bright Pearl instead of One Bright Jewel. Shohaku Okumura, a modern Zen priest and Dōgen scholar, points out that while the character in question (珠) can be used to refer to a pearl, gem, or any kind of jewel, the text clearly uses the term in reference to the \\"Mani Jewel\\" (摩尼珠), a mythical transparent object mentioned in a wide variety of Buddhist texts. Because pearls are not transparent, and because the transparency is essential for the meaning of the essay, \\"pearl\\" is therefore incongruous with the context of the writing. Okumura further argues that a knowledge of the Mani Jewel as it appears in prior texts is essential for understanding the meaning of Dōgen's essay. ===Early References to the Mani Jewel=== Ksitigarbha holding the Cintamani, or wish-fulfilling Jewel The Mani Jewel makes its first appearance in the Pali Nikāyas where it is mentioned as one of the seven treasures owned by a \\"wheel- turning king\\". The Mahasudhassana Sutta in the Digha Nikaya describes the Mani Jewel as follows: > “It was a beryl, pure, excellent, well-cut into eight facets, clear, bright, > unflawed, perfect in every respect. The luster of this Jewel-Treasure > radiated for an entire yojana round about. The Mani Jewel in this text serves as the source of virtue and good governance for the king. Without it he would lose his throne. Later texts describe the Mani Jewel differently. One version is the Cintamani or wish-fulfilling jewel. It was said to be originally owned by the God Indra, but it fell to the earth during a war with the Asuras, allowing whoever possess it to have their wishes granted. Depictions of the Bodhisattvas Ksitigarbha and Avalokiteshvara sometimes show them holding this Cintamani, indicating their ability to fulfill the wishes of sentient beings. The Mani Jewel also appears as a water purifying jewel (清水摩尼) where it could be placed in muddy water by traveling monks, causing any cloudiness to settle out leaving the water clear and pure. This version of the jewel is mentioned in the Abhidharma-kosa where it is used as a metaphor for faith as an agent capable of dispelling uncertainty. Yet another depiction of the jewel is in the metaphor of Indra's net which appears in the Avatamsaka Sutra. It describes a net of infinite size with infinite knots, with each knot containing a Mani Jewel with infinite facets. Each individual Mani Jewel reflects every other Mani Jewel in the same way that any individual being or phenomenon is indistinguishable from the whole or noumenon due to their fundamental interconnectedness. ===The Mani Jewel in Buddha Nature Sutras=== The Lankavatara Sutra, the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, and the Surangama Sutra all used the Mani Jewel as metaphors for Buddha- nature. It was this metaphor in particular that Xuansha Shibei had in mind for his expression \\"the ten-direction world is one bright jewel\\", and is thus the primary focus of Dōgen's essay. In these sutras, a transparent Mani Jewel within us changes colors depending on the conditions around us, representing the five skandhas. The Mani Jewel itself represents each being's Buddha- nature, but because of the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, a being sees only the various colors emitted by the jewel. These are mistakenly perceived as the defilements rather than the purity of the jewel itself, which is merely reflecting conditions around it. Thus Buddha-nature is not perceived and only the five skandhas are seen, which are then conflated with a sense of self in opposition to the Buddhist idea of anātman or no-self. ===The Mani Jewel in Zen=== Later, the Mani Jewel began to appear in texts produced by Zen Buddhists. An early example is found in Guifeng Zongmi's work Chart of the Master-Disciple Succession of the Chan Gate That Transmits the Mind Ground in China in which he compares the four contemporary Zen schools: the Northern School, the Ox Head School, the Hongzhou school and the Heze school. He accomplishes this by comparing how each school would interpret the Mani Jewel metaphor used in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment discussed above. The text also contains the first use of the specific phrase, \\"one bright jewel\\" (一顆明珠). According to Guifeng, the Northern School would believe in a fundamentally pure Mani Jewel that must be cleaned to reveal its purity; the Ox Head school would perceive both the color reflections and the Mani Jewel itself as empty; the Hongzhou school would say that the blackness covering the Mani Jewel is the Jewel itself, and that its purity can never be seen; the Heze School (to which Guifeng belonged) would interpret the black color covering the jewel as an illusion that is in fact just a manifestation of its brightness such that the surface defilements and the purity of the Jewel interpenetrate one another. ==References== Category:Soto Zen Category:Zen texts ","title":"Ikka myōju"},{"id":"46815336","text":"The Queen's Messenger was the first television drama. The experiment was broadcast by a Schenectady, New York station on September 11, 1928. It was a radio drama adapted for television and broadcast both sound and moving pictures. These were received by televisions in diameter that were set up in various places all around the city. There were special effect props for this broadcast to enhance the actors' performance and their sounds. == Background == The 1928 one act play written by J. Hartley Manners was the first television drama. It was a radio drama adapted for television. It was made for television in 1928 by station \\"WGY Television\\" (W2XAD) using a multiple-camera setup and was an experimental broadcast on September 11 at 1:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. The cameras picked up the stage movement action and microphones collected the sound. The television signal was received at a receiving station three miles away, and received much publicity. It was broadcast three years ahead of radio's first soap opera. The teleplay starred retired actress Izetta Jewell. It was noted by the viewers that in the television receivers she appeared trimmer than in real life and that television made a person look slimmer and younger. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper in an article at the time observed that even the heavy set opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink would look like a charming slender woman if on television. The co-star of the television play was Maurice Randall, appearing as a John Bull-type Englishman. Three inch (76 mm) early television receiver ==Plot== A British diplomat has a romantic encounter with a mysterious Russian woman who is secretly trying to obtain secret papers he is carrying in his dispatch case for the queen. The old spy melodrama was selected because it had just two actors and they could alternately select the three television cameras between them and the scene props. == Television receivers == The televised play was received on televisions that were octagonally shaped and about high and in depth. The front panel upper part had a three inch square aperture through which the moving picture was viewed. There were knobs on the lower part which controlled how the radio signals for the television part were received. Six televisions were set up around the WGY studios and connected by closed circuit television for newspaper journalists. There were television receivers set up in the transmitting control rooms that received the signal from the air that was broadcast several miles away. == Special effects == Special techniques had to be devised to show the action movements on a three inch television screen. One was where the likeness of a character was shown to the audience instead of the real person. The facial movements of this figure were then presented in sync with the sound of the spoken parts. This sound part came from a separate radio receiver, that was placed under the television receiver. To show the action parts of the play, special effect props were developed. One example was where the Queen's messenger took a drink of wine – a wine glass appeared and a liquid poured into it from a long-neck bottle. Other props used for the play were watch dials, keys, revolvers, and stacks of documents. The stage for the play consisted of three spotlights, three scanning machines, three microphones, background scenes and other apparatus. The stage coordinator for these props was Mortimer Steward. == Drawbacks == The transmission was a test of General Electric's 48-line television system and lasted 40 minutes. Ernst Alexanderson was the electrical engineer that developed the mechanics of coordinating the sound and moving images that was the beginning of the \\"radio movie\\" that developed into the soap opera. The received radio drama play tended to shift to the right or left of the center of the television screen. This was due to the variation in the speed of the motor used to drive the scanning disc that received the image on the stage. The pictures at the receiving end also flickered somewhat, similarly to the hand-cranked silent films presented at theaters at the time. == See also == *Queen's Messenger ==References Sources == * ==External links== * Drama is Radioed through Television * The Queen's Messenger stage, video of the television drama play being directed * Category:1928 television films Category:1928 in American television Category:1928 drama films Category:1928 films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Drama television films Category:General Electric Category:History of television in the United States Category:Schenectady, New York Category:Films with screenplays by J.

Griswold (July 30, 1930 - January 28, 2017) was an American businesswoman. She was the founder of Griswold Home Care, a corporation founded in 1982 to provide non-medical, in-home care for the elderly and infirm. She was the subject of ongoing press attention because she founded a successful corporation despite using a wheelchair because she suffered from multiple sclerosis. ==Education and personal life== Griswold earned her bachelor's degree in economics and business administration from Douglass College in New Brunswick, N.J. in 1952. She earned her master's degree in counseling from Rutgers University in 1956. Jean and her husband, Lincoln Griswold, lived for many years in Erdenheim, Pennsylvania, where Reverend Griswold was pastor of the Chestnut Hill Presbyterian Church. ==CareerEarly career=== Griswold worked as a guidance counselor at Westfield High School, then as a counselor at the Lutheran Home for the Aged. ===Founding the home care company=== In 1982 Griswold founded a home care company for the elderly and disabled. Initially called Overnight Sitting Service prompted by her discovery that there was no company offering overnight companionship for the frail elderly. The first caregivers Griswold hired when she started the company working from her dining room table were seminary students who stayed nights with the elderly. According to Inc. (magazine) by 1989 the company was a $10-million, multi-state business. The company was soon renamed Special Care Inc., then renamed Griswold Home Care. In 2005 it was described by the Philadelphia Business Journal as, \\"the nation's largest, privately owned nonmedical home-care company.\\" By 2006 the company had 87 franchises in 16 states and some outside the United States. In 2009 it had 103 franchises. Griswold, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, was in a wheelchair when she founded the company, and continued to work from her wheelchair. Griswold's son, Kent, served as president of the company, and her husband, Lincoln, a Presbyterian minister, served as chairman of the board. In 1995 the company attracted media attention when one of its home care employees was arrested while buying illegal drugs, and press reports focused on the fact that since the company does not provide medical services, its employees are not required to be certified and may not be closely supervised. In 2003–2004 Griswold was Entrepreneur in Residence at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ==Recognition== Jean has won numerous awards, including the Spirit of Philadelphia Award. She won Working Woman 2001 Entrepreneur of the Year honor. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society presented Griswold with the 2002 MS National Achievement Award. She was inducted to the Hall of Distinguished Alumni of Rutgers University in 1995. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from Holy Family University in Philadelphia. ==Plays, books about Griswold== Letter to My Daughter: Adventures of Atypical Women, a one- woman play written and performed by Beth Hirst, profiled Griswold, Isadora Duncan, explorer Mary Kingsley, and environmental activist Julia Butterfly Hill as models of women who overcome challenges to lead lives of great achievement.

The street has many cafés and small shops. The street is named after the City of Aarhus, the second largest city in Denmark. ==History== Ny Kalkbrænderi Århusgade crosses an area which was known as Slagtervangen until the second half of the 19th century. The area was owned by the City of Copenhagen but leased to the Butchers' Guild who used it for grazing. The street also passes the site where Ny Kalkbrænderi (\\"The New Lime Plant\\") was built in 1777. It occupied the triangular site between present day Løgstørgade )then Kalkbrænderivej, \\"Lime Plant Road\\"(, Strandboulevarden and Århusgade. In the 1870s, the wine merchant Hans Just built a summer residence near the coast. In 1882, together with other investors, he established a distillery, Fortuna, on the neighbouring site. The oldest section of Århusgade, then named Fortunavej (\\"Fortuna Road\\"), was created in 1885 when they wanted a more direct link between their factory and Østerbrogade. The name Århusgade was introduced in 1886 when a large number of streets in the area were named after larger Danish towns. The man behind the naming scheme was Thorkild Krak. The street was built over with apartments for the many workers at enterprises such as the Øresund cryolite factory and Copenhagen's new Freeport which opened in 1894. ==Notable buildings and residents== No. 101: The former tramway depot, nor Østerbrohuset The Hans Just Warehouse at No. 88 Østerbrohuset (No. 101) is a community centre with sport facilities, mainly used for badminton and basketball, a small café and facilities for local associations. The building is a former tramway depot, Århusgade Remise, built in 1901 to design by Vilhelm Friederichsen for De Kjøbenhavnske Sporveje (\\"Copenhagen Tramways\\"). The building is now used as a community centre with sport facilities, mainly used for badminton and basketball, a small café and facilities for local associations. The Hans Just Warehouse (Hans Just Pakhus) was built in 1917 by Hans Just's son Poul Just. With its nine floors, it was the building in Denmark with most floors at the time of its completion. The building is still owned by the family and serves as headquarters of Hans Just A/S as well as their property company Karberghus. ==Århusgadekvarteret redevelopment== The former headquarters of Russian Danish Trading Company The Århusgade neighbourhood is the first phase of the redevelopment of Copenhagen's northern docklands.

The area will be home to 2,400 residents and 1,700 jobs. The area will consist of a mixture of new and old buildings. The first residents moved into their new apartments in Havnehuset in April 2015. Historic buildings include the former headquarters of Russisk Dansk Handelskompagni (\\"Russian Danish Trading Company\\") from 1918.

Located adjacent to the National Park Service campground, the site includes a central room that features a multi-storied wall and a five-room structure with kiva that was probably occupied during the early 12th century by Mesa Veredans, who built in a distinctive McElmo masonry style. The inhabitants of these dwellings dates from 1150 to 1200 AD, or the late Chacoan Period. National Park Service excavations there during the 1960s uncovered a quantity of perishable items, including sandals and baskets, from the rooms. The Gallo Cliff Dwellings lie on the outskirts of a group of houses, Chacoan Great Houses, lived in by farmers. These people worked on nearby fields to provide food for their families. There is a campground nearby called Gallo Campground and is a great place for camping if you are interested in touring the site. Petroglyphs are carved into many of the faces of the cliffs. Many are too faint to determine what the image was intended to be, but the most common, discernable image are bear paws. These are considered a clan symbol, marking the territory of its members. Next to the cliffs is a valley, and then the Fajada Butte. On one side of this hill is a huge ramp that connects to a place where a calendar was made. It is called the Sun Dagger and keeps track of the way the sun and moon moves. It is believed that this calendar helped the Chacoans follow yearly solstices. These dwellings are very helpful in giving a better look into the lives of the Chacoan people and how they had to adapt to the changing environment around them. As avid farmers who depended on their fields for food, they needed to move when the soil could no longer provide the nutrients for their crops. Nowadays, there are techniques of rotating crops, but back then there was no such strategy. These people would travel, find new places to plant their crops, and build new houses. ==References== ;Bibliography * \\"Gjhikes.com: Gallo Cliff Dwelling.\\" Gjhikes.com: Gallo Cliff Dwelling.

The 32-gun French frigate Prudente had since the start of the war been part of a squadron operating from Île de France (now Mauritius). This squadron had dispersed during 1798, with the ships sent on independent commerce raiding operations across the British trade routes in the Indian Ocean. Prudente had subsequently been seized in the autumn of that year by Anne Joseph Hippolyte de Maurès, Comte de Malartic, the Governor of Île de France, and sold to a private raiding company. In early 1799 Prudente was operating off South Africa, attacking British trade passing to or from the Cape Colony when the ship was discovered by British frigate HMS Daedalus under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Prudente turned away and Ball gave chase, following the French ship closely. After five hours Daedalus caught Prudente and fired a raking broadside into the stern, disabling the French ship. For another hour the action continued at close range until Prudente was forced to surrender. ==Background== By 1799 British forces dominated the Indian Ocean, controlling the economically vital trade routes from China, the Dutch East Indies and British India to Europe. The French Navy had originally deployed only two frigates in the region, Prudente and Cybèle, operating from Port Louis on Île de France. This force was subsequently augmented in the summer of 1796 by a large squadron of frigates under Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, which cruised in the East Indies during 1796 and 1797, suffering setbacks at Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident. During 1798 the squadron dispersed, as his crews became increasingly mutinous and the Colonial Assembly of Île de France grew openly disdainful of his efforts, refusing to provide reinforcements or supplies to his ships. To mitigate this disaffection, Sercey ordered two of his frigates, Prudente and Forte to cruise in the Bay of Bengal against British trade during the autumn of 1798. When these ships returned, Sercey had already sailed for the east, leaving instructions for the frigates to follow. These orders were however countermanded by the Governor of Île de France, Malartic, who ordered the frigates seized while they were in harbour. Although Sercey protested Malartic's actions, the governor issued new orders to the ships: Forte was sent northeast to operate in the Bay of Bengal off Calcutta while Prudente was partially disarmed and sold to a privateering concern to operate against trade as a commercial investment. ==Battle== Command of Prudente was given to Captain Emanuel-Hippolite Le Jolliff, who sailed to the region to the east of the British held Cape Colony to prey on transoceanic merchant shipping sailing to and from Cape Town. The cruise achieved some success, including the seizure of an American merchant ship from Canton, which had been given a prize crew of 17 and armed with 6-pounder guns from Prudente's quarterdeck, leaving the French frigate with only 30 guns including its main battery of 12-pounder long guns. At dawn on 9 February 1799, while sailing approximately southwest of the coast of Natal a sail was seen to the southeast, approaching rapidly. Recognising a British frigate, La Joliff ordered his ships to separate at 07:00, the American ship sailing south while he took Prudente northwards, hoping to draw off the British ship so that the prize could escape. The new arrival was HMS Daedalus, a 32-gun 12-pounder Royal Navy frigate under the command of Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Ball maintained pursuit of Prudente, running behind his opponent until 10:00 when La Joliff swung his frigate to starboard with the wind, Ball following close behind. With the British frigate closing, la Joliff ordered his men to begin firing their stern-chasers at Daedalus and at 12:10 hauled up to engage, firing a broadside into the British ship. Ball shortened sail and brought his ship across the stern of Prudente, firing a devastating raking broadside into the French frigate at 12:25. Ball then drew Daedalus alongside Prudente and the ships fought a close range broadside duel, fire from Ball's ship bringing down the mizenmast on Prudente after 15 minutes. It was only at 13:21, more than an hour after the battle had begun, that La Joliff acknowledged the damage to his ship and struck his colours. ==Aftermath== Prudente was badly damaged in the engagement and had lost heavy casualties, including 27 killed and 22 wounded. Losses and damage on Daedalus were much lighter, with only one sailor and one Royal Marine killed and eleven wounded. Ball conducted hasty repairs and then brought the captured Prudente into Table Bay on 15 February. There the captured ship was condemned by the port commander Captain George Losack: although Prudente was a high-quality ship the naval facilities at the Cape Colony were insufficient to conduct the necessary repairs and the French frigate was not subsequently commissioned into the Royal Navy. As a result, there were few rewards for the action, unusually the junior officers of Daedalus were not promoted in the aftermath of the battle. Among the prisoners taken from Prudente was a deserter from the Royal Navy named Thomas Tring, who was subsequently court martialed and hanged. In the Indian Ocean theatre the loss of Prudente was compounded a few weeks later by the capture of Forte at the Action of 28 February 1799, which left Sercey with a shortage of available warships. At the Action of 11 December 1799 his last frigate, Preneuse, was intercepted and destroyed off Île de France. A commander without a command, the French admiral returned to France and subsequently retired. ==CitationsReferences== * * * Category:Naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Conflicts in 1799 Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Naval battles involving France ","title":"Action of 9 February 1799 (South Africa)"},{"id":"46815783","text":"Allyl glycidyl ether is an organic compound used in adhesives and sealants and as a monomer for polymerization reactions. It is formally the condensation product of allyl alcohol and glycidol via an ether linkage. Because it contains both an alkene and an epoxide group, either group can be reacted selectively to yield a product where the other functional group remains intact for future reactions. ==Preparation== AGE is prepared commercially by the etherification of allyl alcohol with epichlorohydrin. Hydrogen chloride, the byproduct of their condensation, is removed with a base. The synthesis of allyl glycidyl ether by condensation of allyl alcohol and epichlorohydrin AGE can also be synthesized by monoepoxidation of diallyl ether. The synthesis of allyl glycidyl ether by epoxidation of diallyl ether Diepoxidation of the second alkene would produce diglycidyl ether. Allyl glycidyl ether is chiral. Most routes yield a racemic mixture. Epoxidation using monooxygenase enzyme proceeds enantioselectively. The enantioselective synthesis of allyl glycidyl ether by microbial epoxidation of diallyl ether Alternately, nucleophilic cyclization of either chirality of the secondary alcohol onto a primary tosylate gives the chiral epoxide product. The synthesis of a single enantiomer of allyl glycidyl ether by cyclization of a single enantiomer of the acylic alcohol ==Uses== Allyl glycidyl ether is used in adhesives and sealants and as a monomer for various types of polymer preparations. == Reactions  Polymerization === As a bifunctional compound, the alkene group or the epoxide group can be reacted selectively to yield a product where the other functional group remains intact for future reactions. For example, either one of them could be used for linear polymerization, and then the other used for cross-linking. Radical polymerization of the propylene portion in the presence of methyl acrylate yields a block copolymer with a high epoxide content. Similarly, it is can be used in the production of polyvinylcaprolactam as a chain transfer agent. Nucleophilic polymerization of the epoxide groups gives a material that has the same backbone as polyethylene glycol, with allyl-ether side chains. The additional Lewis basic ether sites alter ion transport in the polymer and also affect the transient inter-chain crosslinking and glass transition temperature in the presence of metal ions. These properties suggest that the material may have applications as an alternative electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries. The alkenes can be elaborated into short polyethylene-glycol oligomers to further increase the ion-binding ability and enhance the resulting material properties. Block copolymers with ethylene oxide form micelles, which could be useful for encapsulating other molecules as part of a drug delivery system. The alkenes of these macromolecular structures can also be cross-linked via radical polymerization. Lewis-acid-catalyzed co-polymerisation with carbon dioxide likewise gives a polycarbonate material with allyl side chains that can be further elaborated. === Hydrosilylation === Rather than polymerization, the alkene group can undergo a hydrosilylation reaction with siloxanes in the presence of chloroplatinic acid as catalyst. Like the polymerization reactions, this reaction also leaves the epoxide intact. By this reaction, allyl glycidyl ether finds use as an intermediate in the production of silane coatings for electrical applications. ==References== Category:Ethers Category:Allyl compounds Category:Epoxides ","title":"Allyl glycidyl ether"},{"id":"46815794","text":"Cellach mac Cerbaill (nicknamed Cellach of the Hard Conflicts) was king of Osraige from 905 to his death in 908.The History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory, vol.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Afghanistan, with thin bluish-green leaves and creamy yellow or white flowers, that are veined with purple-brown. It has yellow-green or purple beards. Although, in the wild, it can vary in colour and size. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. ==Description== It has a small brown rhizome.British Iris Society (1997) Underneath, are long thin secondary roots. It forms small tufts of plants, which can be up to across. It has slender, bluish-green leaves, which have a narrow white, membranous inner margin. They can reach up to long, and between 0.2–0.6 cm wide but the outer leaves are often sickle-shaped (falcate).James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) The leaves appear in February (in Europe) and after flowering they die away completely. The plants can vary in size depending on the location and the altitude. At higher altitudes, the plants are deeper in colour and smaller (around about 10 cm tall). At lower altitudes, the plants are larger (around tall) and more paler in colour. The stems (or scapes) can grow up to between tall. The stems hold 1, sometimes 2 terminal (top of stem) flowers, in late spring to early summer, between April and June. The flowers are in diameter, come in shades of creamy yellow or white. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The cream or white, drooping falls have a central purple signal patch, surrounded by purple-brown veining. In the centre of the petal is a beard of greenish yellow or purple hairs. The pale yellow upright standards, are long, they have a beard of greenish hairs on the lower part. As mentioned before, the plants can vary in colour due to altitude, the lower altitude plants can have pure white standards. It has a short style arm (above the falls) that is yellow, and veined with pale green. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which has not been described. ===Biochemistry=== As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted twice, as 2n=22, by Gustafsson & Wendelbo, in 1975 and 2n=22, by Johnson & Brandham in 1997. It is commonly published as 2n=22. == Taxonomy== The Latin specific epithet afghanica refers to the country of Afghanistan, (where the iris comes from). In 1964, it was found by Rear Admiral Paul Furse and his wife Polly, in Afghanistan, on the northern side of the Salang Pass in the Hindu Kush, north of the city of Kabul. They initially thought that the iris was similar to Iris darwasica. Later in 1966, on another plant hunting trip, they found more specimens of the iris and realised it was a new species. It was first published and described by Per Wendelbo in 'Findings of the Royal Botanical Gardens of Edinburgh' (Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh) Vol.31 Issue 2, page338 in 1972. It was also published in the Botanical Magazine Vol.668 in 1974. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 2 December 2004. Iris afghanica is an accepted name by the RHS. ==Distribution and habitat== It is native to temperate Asia. ===Range=== It is found in north eastern Afghanistan. It is found in the Provinces of Afghanistan, within Balkh and Zabul Province regions, along the Salang River, or in Kataghan Province. One source mentions the distribution range also extends to Pakistan. ===Habitat=== It grows on the sunny, rocky mountain slopes composed of granite or shale, It was also recorded by Grey-Wilson (1973), as growing \\"amongst boulders along the banks of the Salang River or on rocky slopes amongst grasses away from the river confines\\". They can be found at an altitude of between above sea level. ==Conservation== As of 26 May 2015, the iris has not yet been evaluated to IUCN Red List criteria. ==Cultivation== It is hardy to European Zone H4. Within UK, it is hardy but is best grown within a well-ventilated cold frame or alpine house. It replicate the natural conditions of hot, dry summers and freezing winters. It is best grown within well drained soils in a sunny situation. The plant is very sensitive to moisture and it needs to be heated in the sun. The rhizomes are very prone to viral diseases, if they are exposed to moisture or dampness. It can be seen in the 'Davies Alpine House' within Kew Gardens. It is rare in cultivation (within the US), but established in cultivation (within Europe). ===Propagation=== It can be propagated by division or by seed growing. Division is better carried out in late summer. ==Toxicity== Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. ==ReferencesSources== * Heywood and Chant, 1982. Popular Encyclopedia of Plants. 181. * Mathew, B. 1981.

He previously played for the Atlanta Braves. He was selected by the Braves with the 14th overall pick in the first round of the 2015 MLB draft. ==Early life and amateur career== Kolby Allard was born in Anaheim, California on August 13, 1997, to parents Kenny and Kristi. He has a younger brother. Allard began playing baseball at the age of five, and focused on pitching at age ten. Allard attended San Clemente High School in San Clemente, California. As a junior, he had a 1.32 earned run average (ERA) with 98 strikeouts in innings pitched. After the season, he played in the Perfect Game All-American Classic, where he was named MVP after striking out the side in the inning he pitched. Later in the summer he played for the USA Baseball 18U National Team. Allard's senior season ended prematurely after he suffered a stress fracture in his back. Prior to the injury, Allard was projected to be a top 10 pick in the 2015 Major League Baseball Draft. He committed to play college baseball for the UCLA Bruins. ==Professional careerAtlanta Braves=== The Atlanta Braves selected Allard with the 14th pick in the first round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft.

Allard began pitching for the Gulf Coast League Braves in August 2015. After three scoreless appearances, he was shut down for back surgery which was described as a \\"minor back procedure.\\" The Braves sent Allard to extended spring training to start the 2016 season. Allard spent 2016 with both the Rome Braves and the Danville Braves. In 2017, he pitched for the Mississippi Braves. The next year Allard was invited to spring training and ultimately began the season with the Gwinnett Stripers.

Jamesport's original name was James' Port from the community a mile south of the railroad. ==History== The first station depot appears on the timetable of June 14, 1845. In August–September 1869 the depot was reconstructed on a site farther to the west, and a platform extending in either direction added. At 3 AM on October 17, 1877 the station building was set on fire by an incendiary and burned to the ground. It was replaced in July 1878 when the LIRR purchased the saloon building of Charles H. Payne for $200 and converted it to a railroad depot, moving the station now slightly east. The following year, overhangs were added and a standard platform built. A bay window would be installed in the succeeding years. On August 11, 1958, a streamlined revision of century-old practices in eastern Long Island was announced by President Goodfellow included the scheduled for closure in Riverhead town were Calverton and Jamesport. Jamesport sold no tickets during the year 1957. Since the railroad needed approval from the PSC, a hearing was held on October 3, 1958 in New York City. A few months later on December 11, the PSC authorized the LIRR to discontinue agents at Jamesport and Calverton among other depots, and Jamesport was closed. As of February 11, 1959, the agents were reassigned and the district manager delegated. The Jamesport depot, which was extensively remodeled in 1944, lay abandoned until it was razed on July 18, 1963.\\"The Long Island Rail Road: A Comprehensive History: Part Six - The Golden Age 1881-1900,\\" by Vincent F. Seyfried \\"The Long Island Rail Road: A Comprehensive History: Part Three - The Age of Expansion 1863-1880,\\" by Vincent F. Seyfried A shelter shed was constructed in its place, just west of the depot location on North Railroad Avenue near the Washington Avenue grade crossing. On February 19, 1962, LIRR Road ‘n Rail began and a discontinuation of select rail service began. There was a Road 'n Rail stop for Jamesport at Main Street. The Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority took over the LIRR in 1966, including the Road 'n Rail buses. On January 7, 1972, the MTA proposed that a new fare structure be instituted, in which commuters would pay the same fare regardless of where they boarded the train within a zone. While the stations in zone were close together, they had to be as far as possible from stations in adjoining zones to justify the difference. Running north to south, the scheme would serve an additional purpose as some trains would make all stops in a zone and then run express to New York. Jamesport was in zone 13. New streamlined service improved operation but it would eventually lead to the end of service on little-used East End stations such as Calverton and Jamesport. Road n' Rail service ended on October 15, 1982. Service at Jamesport ended on April 30, 1984 because of limited patronage. An additional factor that contributed to its closure was the electrification of the Main Line from Hicksville to Ronkonkoma. Periodic midday service suspension on the Main Line east of Hicksville to accommodate work on electrification brought few trains to the East End. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Postcard of an older image of Jamesport Station Category:Former Long Island Rail Road stations in Suffolk County, New York Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1845 Category:Railway stations closed in 1984 Category:1845 establishments in New York (state) Category:1984 disestablishments in New York (state) ","title":"Jamesport station"},{"id":"46815998","text":"Balsamorhiza lanata, with the common name lanate balsamroot, is a species of plant in the sunflower tribe of the aster family native to California. ==Distribution== The plant is endemic to Northern California.

He is especially remembered for his important work in Germany with Paul Ehrlich. He discovered the therapeutic qualities of acridine dyes. ==Life== He was born on 21 May 1881 the son of Friederike Sophia Pauline (née Schmeltzer 1851–1895) and Hugh Hamilton Browning (1845–1927), a schoolmaster. He studied at Glasgow Academy where he excelled becoming the Dux and receiving medals in classics, English and mathematics. He then went to the University of Glasgow from 1900 to 1907 where he graduated in medicine. Using a combination of Coats scholarship and election as a Carnegie Fellow he travelled to Frankfurt-am-Main in Germany for two years of study at the Paul Ehrlich Institute, 1905 to 1907. In 1908 he began lecturing in bacteriology at the University of Glasgow, working under Prof Robert Muir. As a result of his prestigious research in Germany, in 1911 he was appointed director of the clinical laboratory at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, aged 30. During the First World War he was appointed to the Bland- Sutton Institute of Pathology at the Middlesex Hospital. During the war he also obtained a professorship in bacteriology at London University. After the war he returned to his home city of Glasgow and was professor of bacteriology at the University of Glasgow (known as the Gardiner Chair) until retirement in 1951. In 1935 the University of St Andrews awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters (LLD). In 1936 the University of Edinburgh awarded him the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics, based for his work on chemotherapy . In 1947 Browning created a section specialising in medical mycology (fungal diseases in humans) at his Department in Glasgow’s Western Infirmary. He entrusted the running of this section to James Clark Gentles (1921-1997).http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/gentles_james.pdf Rowning specifically chose Gentles as a botanist, rather than a doctor, realising the importance of recognising different species of fungus.The Herald (newspaper) 22 Nov 1997 He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1928 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1945.

He was a son of Daniel Augustus Oliver and Elizabeth Willard (née Shaw) Oliver (1823–1850), who died three years after his birth. His maternal grandparents were Robert Gould Shaw and Eliza Willard (née Parkman) Shaw. Through his abolitionist uncle Francis George Shaw and, his wife, Sarah Blake Sturgis Shaw, he was a first cousin of Josephine Shaw Lowell (wife of Charles Russell Lowell) and Robert Gould Shaw (who was killed at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner during the Civil War).

Designer drugs are structural or functional analogues of controlled substances that are designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the parent drug while avoiding detection or classification as illegal. Many of the older designer drugs (research chemicals) are structural analogues of psychoactive tryptamines or phenethylamines but there are many other chemically unrelated new psychoactive substances that can be considered part of the designer drug group. Designer drugs can also include substances that are not psychoactive in effect, such as analogues of controlled anabolic steroids and other performance and image enhancing drugs (PIEDs), including nootropics, weight loss drugs and erectile dysfunction medications. The pharmaceutical activities of these compounds might not be predictable based strictly upon structural examination. Many of the substances have common effects while structurally different or different effects while structurally similar due to SAR paradox. As a result of no real official naming for some of these compounds, as well as regional naming, this can all lead to potentially hazardous mix ups for users. The following list is not exhaustive. == Psychedelics == A psychedelic substance is a psychoactive drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception. Psychedelics tend to affect and explore the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, yoga, religious ecstasy, dreaming and even near-death experiences. === Lysergamides === Lysergamides are amide derivatives of the alkaloid lysergic acid. === Tryptamines === Drugs containing the tryptamine moiety are typically substrates for the serotonin receptors, in keeping with their close structural resemblance to serotonin, a neurotransmitter. === Benzofurans = Phenethylamines === Drugs containing the phenethylamine moiety bear close structural resemblance to dopamine but substitution on the benzene ring gives rise to drugs with a much higher affinity for serotonin receptors.  2C-x  2C-x class of psychedelics are 2,5-dimethoxy-phenethylamine derivatives.  NBxx   DOx  The DOx family of psychedelics are also known as \\"substituted amphetamines\\" as they contain the amphetamine backbone but are substituted on the benzene ring. This gives rise to serotonin agonists similar to the 2C-X class but more resistant to elimination in the body. == Dissociatives == Dissociatives are a class of hallucinogens which distort perceptions of sight and sound and produce feelings of detachment - dissociation - from the environment and self. This is done through reducing or blocking signals to the conscious mind from other parts of the brain. Although many kinds of drugs are capable of such action, dissociatives are unique in that they do so in such a way that they produce hallucinogenic effects, which may include sensory deprivation, dissociation, hallucinations, and dream-like states or trances. Some, which are nonselective in action and affect the dopamine and/or opioid systems, may be capable of inducing euphoria. Many dissociatives have general depressant effects and can produce sedation, respiratory depression, analgesia, anesthesia, and ataxia, as well as cognitive and memory impairment and amnesia. === Arylcyclohexylamines === Arylcyclohexylamines are the oldest and most widely used dissociatives. The class includes the well known anaesthetic, ketamine. === Diarylethylamines === Diarylethylamines began to appear on grey markets only as recently as 2013. === Misc === * Dizocilpine, MK-801 * Glaucine * PD-137889 (P-89) == Piperazines == Piperazine containing designer drugs have effects similar to MDMA (ecstasy). This class of drugs are mimics of serotonin that activate 5-HT receptor subtypes that release norepinephrine and dopamine. == Empathogens == Empathogens are a class of psychoactive drugs that produce distinctive emotional and social effects similar to those of MDMA . Users of empathogens say the drugs often produce feelings of empathy, love, and emotional closeness to others. === MDxx === Substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamines (MDxx) are a large chemical class of derivatives of the phenethylamines, which includes many psychoactive drugs that act as entactogens, psychedelics, and/or stimulants, as well as entheogens. === Benzofurans === Benzofurans are similar in structure to MD(M)A but differ in that the methylenedioxy groups have been modified, removing one of the two oxygens in the methylenedioxy ring to render a benzofuran ring. === Miscellaneous polycyclic phenethylamines === Indane and tetralin-type phenethylamines are vaguely related to their amphetamine analogues. Only one non-tryptamine indole has been sold, 5-IT. It shows strong MAOI activity. * 5-IT, 5-API, PAL-571 === Tryptamines === Drugs containing the tryptamine moiety are typically substrates for the serotonin receptors, in keeping with their close structural resemblance to serotonin, a neurotransmitter. === Amphetamines === Substituted amphetamines are a chemical class of stimulants, entactogens, hallucinogens, and other drugs. They feature a phenethylamine core with a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon resulting in amphetamine, along with additional substitutions. == Stimulants == Stimulants produce a variety of different kinds of effects by enhancing the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Common effects, which vary depending on the substance and dosage in question, may include enhanced alertness, awareness, wakefulness, endurance, productivity, and motivation, increased arousal, locomotion, heart rate, and blood pressure, and the perception of a diminished requirement for food and sleep. === Amphetamines === Amphetamines are a chemical class of stimulants, entactogens, hallucinogens, and other drugs. They feature a phenethylamine core with a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon resulting in amphetamine, along with additional substitutions. === Cathinones === Cathinones include some stimulants and entactogens, which are derivatives of cathinone. They feature a phenethylamine core with an alkyl group attached to the alpha carbon, and a ketone group attached to the beta carbon, along with additional substitutions. === Pyrrolidines and Pyrrolidinophenones === Pyrrolidines are amphetamines with a pyrrolidine group. Pyrrolidinophenones (also called Pyrovalerones) are cathinones (βk-amphetamines) with a pyrrolidine group. === Thiophenes === Thiophenes are stimulant drugs which are analogues of amphetamine or cathinone where the phenyl ring has been replaced by thiophene. === Tropanes and Piperidines === Tropane alkaloids occur in plants of the families erythroxylaceae (including coca). Piperidine and its derivatives are ubiquitous building blocks in the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. === Oxazolidines === Oxazolidines are a five-membered ring compounds consisting of three carbons, a nitrogen, and an oxygen. The oxygen and NH are the 1 and 3 positions, respectively. In oxazolidine derivatives, there is always a carbon between the oxygen and the nitrogen. === Phenylmorpholines === Phenylmorpholines are a class of stimulants containing a phenethylamine skeleton in which the terminal amine is incorporated into a morpholine ring. === Misc = Sedatives == Sedatives are substances that induces sedation by reducing irritability or excitement. At higher doses they may result in slurred speech, staggering gait, poor judgment, and slow, uncertain reflexes. Doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepines, when used as a hypnotic to induce sleep, tend to be higher than amounts used to relieve anxiety, whereas only low doses are needed to provide a peaceful effect. Sedatives can be misused to produce an overly-calming effect. In the event of an overdose or if combined with another sedative, many of these drugs can cause unconsciousness and even death. === Opioids === Opioids have pharmacologic actions resembling morphine and other components of opium. === Benzodiazepines ===  Thienodiazepines  === GHB analogues = Methaqualone analogues = Misc = Synthetic cannabinoids == Agonists of the central cannabinoid receptor type 1 mimic the behavioral effects of cannabis. === Classical cannabinoids = Miscellaneous cannabinoids = Indazole based === Indazole containing cannabinoid receptor agonists include: === Indole based === Indole containing cannabinoid receptor agonists include:  Quinolinylindoles   Benzoylindoles   Adamantoylindoles   Naphthoylindoles   Phenylacetylindoles  == Androgens == Androgenic anabolic steroids have approved medical uses as well as used illicitly as performance-enhancing drugs to build muscle mass and strength. Anabolic steroids that have been designed to evade detection in sport doping tests are known as \\"designer steroids\\". === Testosterone based = DHT based = Estranes = SARMs === Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are a novel class of androgen receptor ligands. They are intended to maintain the desirable muscle building effects of anabolic steroids while reducing undesirable androgenic actions (e.g., increased risk of prostate cancer). SARMs that are more selective in their action potentially could be used for a wider range clinical indications than the relatively limited legitimate uses that anabolic steroids are currently approved for. ===Others=== * 3-Aminoisobutyric acid * Acadesine, AICAR * AWRQNTRYSRIEAIKIQILSKLRL-amide * Anserine * beta-Hydroxybutyric acid == Peptides  GHRH analogues === GHRH analogues stimulate the release of growth hormone. === Growth hormone secretagogue receptor agonists === Agonists of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor regulate energy homeostasis and body weight. === Others = PDE5 inhibitors == PDE5 inhibitors are typically used to treat erectile dysfunction and improve sexual stamina. == Nootropics  See also == * Arylcyclohexylamine * List of cocaine analogues * List of fentanyl analogues * List of methylphenidate analogues * List of androgens/anabolic steroids * Substituted amphetamine * Substituted cathinone * Substituted phenylmorpholine * Substituted phenethylamine * Substituted tryptamine * PiHKAL * TiHKAL == References == Category:Lists of drugs Category:Designer drugs Category:Hallucinations ","title":"List of designer drugs"},{"id":"46816123","text":"Oleksandr Mykhaylovych Stepanov (; born 26 May 1983) is a former Ukrainian football player. ==External links== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Ukrainian footballers Category:FC Bukovyna Chernivtsi players Category:FC Spartak Vladikavkaz players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:Ukrainian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:Expatriate footballers in Finland Category:FC Zirka Kropyvnytskyi players Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Saturn Ramenskoye players Category:FC Novokuznetsk players ","title":"Oleksandr Stepanov"},{"id":"46816133","text":"Albert Theodore Twesme (August 7, 1879 - June 27, 1949) was an American jurist and politician.

On the title-page of this work he calls himself a \\"Gentleman and Practitioner of Musicke.\\" It contains fourteen songs in four parts, which may be sung as part- songs or as solos by a soprano voice, accompanied by the lute, or the lute and bass-viol.

As no second collection appeared, it is probable that the composer did not meet with sufficient encouragement in all cases. Besides, the English madrigal period was rapidly declining; indeed, the book is among the last known books of lute airs.

Juliani, published by Penn State University Press. The book discusses Italian immigration to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from its beginnings in the 1750s through the 1870s.Martinelli, p. 935-936. The book discusses the individual Italian Americans and the social issues the early Italian American community faced.Martinelli, p. 936. John Zucchi of McGill University wrote that Building Little Italy was against the practice of being filiopietistic, or members of an ethnic group emphasizing \\"the presence of their \\"tribe\\" in a particular locale from the early history of a European presence in that locus\\" in order \\"to bolster the community or to respond to a perceived self-disesteem of their ethnic group\\".Zucchi, p. 327-328. Stefano Luconi of the University of Florence wrote that this book differed from a trend of most research of Italian Americans being \\"a hagiographic defense of Italian immigrants' contributions to the cultural, political, and economic development of American society to counter negative stereotypes of Italians as foreigners incapable of assimilation into their adoptive country.\\"Luconi, p. 121. ==Background== Juliani is a professor of sociology at Villanova University.Flynn, p. 110. Juliani began his research career in the mid-1960s,Varbero, p. 258 and had researched Philadelphia's Italian community for 30 years prior to the publication of the book.Gabaccia, p. 490. The book uses many sources related to Father Antonio Isoleri, who, from 1870 through 1926, served as the pastor of an Italian American church in Little Italy, Saint Mary Magdalen dei Pazzi Church, America's first Italian ethnic church. These sources include notes, sermons, letters, plays, and poems, with a total of over 20,000 pages. Other sources used include newspapers, Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) documents, and U.S. Census documents.Casino, p. 405. As of 1999, the Italians in the United States in the 1880-1940 and post 1940 periods had received more scholarly attention than those pre-1880,Migliore, p. 604. and as of 2000 most researchers begin at 1880. The book's subjects are skilled northern Italians,Vecchio, p. 139. while the more commonly studied later immigrants were mostly southern Italians who had less skills and education than the previous group. ==Contents== The book has an introduction and eight chapters. The first describes what is known about the people who lived in the earliest Italian settlements in Philadelphia while chapters two through eight discuss how the community evolved.Migliore, p. 605. The book has one chapter dedicated to Little Italy during the discussed time period; Zucchi stated that this chapter \\"is particularly useful as a reconstruction of an ethnic neighbourhood.\\"Zucchi, p. 328. The book also discusses how Philadelphia's Italian community responded to the American Civil War and the Italian unification, and Michael Miller Topp of the University of Texas El Paso argued that this \\"political dimension\\" was \\"one of the greatest strengths of his book.\\"Topp, p. 501. The book's content ends at the 1870 Census. The book also has a bibliographic essay, titled \\"Authenticating an Early Presence,\\" and an appendix.Migliore, p. 606. Supplementary materials include scans of documents, maps, and photographs. Documents include assessment rolls, census records, city directories, church registers, naturalization records, newspapers, and wills. One of the documents is the 1870 manuscript census. Charles L. Flynn, Jr. of Assumption College described the second half of the book as \\"richer\\" since it describes a fully formed Italian community and uses the manuscript census and other sources generated during the period. Donna R. Gabaccia of University of North Carolina at Charlotte wrote that \\"The strength of Juliani's study is his ability to tease out the implications of these early years of migration and settlement for the subsequent history of Philadelphia's Little Italy.\\"Gabaccia, p. 490. Salvatore J. Lagumina of Nassau Community College wrote that Juliani \\"correctly describes\\" the early Philadelphia Italian community; Lagumina wrote that Juliani was forced to use \\"deductive reasoning\\" and \\"tentative conclusions\\" due to a lack of quality archives, a paucity of known primary sources, and differences in spelling of names.Lagumina, p. 267. Topp stated that this lack of evidence had hampered the quality of the book's initial two chapters. ==Reception== Joseph J. Casino of the Archives of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia wrote that the book had \\"clear explanations and engaging style\\" and that \\"If it were not for the erudition and craftsmanship of its author, this work might have choked on its own richness.\\"Casino, p. 407. Gabaccia argued that \\"Juliani seems to have experienced greater difficulties in interpreting Philadelphia's early Italian residents within the context of their own times, especially before the Napoleonic Wars.\\"Gabaccia, p. 491. She suggested using a \\"global and comparative approach\\" instead. Luconi wrote \\"Juliani has produced a work of remarkable scholarship.\\"Luconi, p. 122. He argued that since Liguria was the place of origin of most of Philadelphia's early Italians, a reader may want to have more information about the subjects' pre-immigration backgrounds. Sam Migliore of the University College of Cape Breton wrote that Juliani \\"makes an important contribution to this general body of literature\\". Stephen J. Sullivan, an employee of Lawrence High School in Cedarhurst, New York, wrote in the Journal of Urban History that he was \\"quite impressed\\" by how the book's author \\"painstakingly examines and describes the complex matrix of social and political institutions already established by Italian pioneers before the great post-1870 migrations began\\".Sullivan, p. 325. Topp had an overall positive reaction to the book. He argued that the \\"painstaking examinations of census records\\" may not have been concise enough and may not be of interest to readers, and Topp believed \\"Juliani's assumption that his subjects regarded assimilation as a singular and uncomplex goal [was] unsettling.\\" Richard A. Varbero of State University of New York, New Paltz stated that the book was \\"a fine contribution to the studies of Philadelphia\\" and is \\"a probing and valuable account of Philadelphia as it evolved into a major integer of the rapidly industrializing nation.\\"Varbero, p. 259. Varbero added that due to the less concentrated and smaller nature of the early Italian community, \\"the portraits he paints lack the intensity, volatility, and human drama discovered in the wards, the schools, and the churches of the post-1880 period.\\" Diane Vecchio of Furman University wrote that the author \\"successfully demonstrates that by 1870 the Italian population in Philadelphia had created an ethnic community that was clearly in place as the origins of Italian immigrants shifted from Italy's northern and central areas to regions of the South and Sicily\\";Vecchio, p. 140. she argued that the book had a good explanation of how the emigration interacted with the cities politics and its \\"examination of early immigrant communal development within the political, commercial, and intellectual context of the city\\"; Vecchio argued that the author should have elaborated more on the role of women in the community. Robert M. Zecker, a PhD candidate in American civilization at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that the book is a \\"fascinating study of the early “protocommunity”\\" that has a \\"wealth of insights\\".Zecker, p. 240. Zucchi stated that the book was well written and that it \\"crowns years of research on the part of a sociologist who seems very much at home in the discipline of history. He added that due to the large amount of detail, it was \\"not an easy read.\\" He suggested that the book could rely on its tables instead of including the data within the text. ==See also== * Staying Italian * History of the Italian Americans in Philadelphia ==References== * Casino, Joseph J.

Because it is known only from three partial jawbones, it is unclear if these specimens indeed represent a unique species or belong to the much better known A. afarensis. A. deyiremeda is distinguished by its forward facing cheek bones and small cheek teeth compared to those of other early hominins. It is unclear if a partial foot specimen exhibiting a dextrous big toe (a characteristic unknown in any australopith) can be assigned to A. deyiremeda. A. deyiremeda lived in a mosaic environment featuring both open grasslands and lake- or riverside forests, and anthropologist Fred Spoor suggests it may have been involved in the Kenyan Lomekwi stone tool industry typically assigned to Kenyanthropus. A. deyiremeda coexisted with A. afarensis, and they may have exhibited niche partitioning to avoid competing with each other for the same resources, such as by relying on different fallback foods during leaner times. ==Taxonomy== Australopithecus deyiremeda was first proposed in 2015 by Ethiopian palaeoanthropologist Yohannes Haile- Selassie and colleagues based on jawbone fossils from the Burtele and Waytaleyta areas of Woranso–Mille, Afar Region, Ethiopia. The holotype specimen, a young adult left maxilla with all teeth except the first incisor and third molar BRT-VP-3/1, was discovered on 4 March 2011 by local Mohammed Barao. The paratype specimens are a complete adult body of the mandible with all incisors BRT-VP-3/14, and an adult right toothless jawbone WYT-VP-2/10, which were discovered by Ethiopian fossil hunter Ato Alemayehu Asfaw . A right maxilla fragment with the fourth premolar BRT-VP-3/37 was found east of BRT- VP-3/14, and it is unclear if these belonged to the same individual. The sediments were radiometrically dated to 3.5–3.3 million years ago, the Middle Pliocene. The describers believed the remains were distinct enough from the contemporary and well-known A. afarensis to warrant species distinction, and A. deyiremeda is counted among a growing diversity of Late Pliocene australopithecines alongside A. afarensis, A. bahrelghazali, and Kenyanthropus platyops. The name deyiremeda derives from the Afar language meaning \\"close relative\\" because, existing so early in time, they considered A. deyiremeda to have been closely related to future australopiths. However, though the proposed distinguishing characteristics are apparently statistically significant, given how few specimens of A. deyiremeda exist, it is unclear if this indeed warrants species distinction or if these specimens simply add to the normal range of variation for A. afarensis. If it is a valid species, then it could possibly indicate some A. afarensis specimens are currently classified into the wrong species. Haile-Selassie and colleagues noted that, though it shares many similarities with Paranthropus, it may not have been closely related because it lacked enlarged molars which are characteristic of Paranthropus. ==Anatomy== Despite being so early, the jaws of A. deyiremeda show some similarities to those of the later Homo and the robust Paranthropus. The jaw jutted out somewhat (prognathism) at perhaps a 39° angle, similar to most other early hominins. The cheekbone is positioned more forward than most A. afarensis specimens. Unlike A. afarensis but like Paranthropus, the walls of the cheek teeth are inclined rather than coming straight up. The upper canines are smaller than those of other Australopithecus, and are morphologically more like those of A. anamensis. The cheek teeth are quite small for an early hominin, and the 1st molar is the smallest reported for an adult Pliocene hominin. Nonetheless, the enamel was still thick as other early hominins, and the enamel on the 2nd molar is quite high and more similar to P. robustus. The jawbone, though small, is robust and more similar to that of Paranthropus. Reconstruction of BRT-VP-2/73 In 2012, a 3.4 million year old partial foot, BRT-VP-2/73, was recovered from Woranso–Mille. It strongly diverges from contemporary and later hominins by having a dextrous big toe like the earlier Ardipithecus ramidus, and consequently has not been assigned to a species. Though more diagnostic facial elements have since been discovered in the area, they are not clearly associated with the foot. ==Palaeoecology== A. deyiremeda features a strong jawbone and thick enamel, consistent with a diet of tough sedges and similar foods which australopiths are generally thought to have primarily subsisted upon. The enamel on the upper incisor, canine, and first premolar exhibits hypoplasia, probably caused by a period of malnutrition or illness during enamel growth in infancy while the teeth were still growing. A. deyiremeda was likely a generalist feeder. If A. deyiremeda is indeed distinct from A. afarensis, then these two species may have exhibited niche partitioning given they cohabited the same area. Given dental and chewing differences, they may have had different dietary and/or habitat preferences, unless these differences were simply a product of genetic drift. Much like chimps and gorillas which have more or less the same diet and inhabit the same areas, A. deyiremeda and A. afarensis may have shared typical foods when in abundance, and resorted to different fallback foods in times of food scarcity. The Lomekwi stone tool industry from northern Kenya is loosely associated with the Middle Pliocene Kenyanthropus based on an upper jaw fragment assigned to Kenyanthropus based on forward cheekbones, three-rooted premolars, and small first molar. Since these features are also exhibited in A. deyiremeda, anthropologist Fred Spoor suggested that A. deyiremeda was actually present at the site. The Lomekwian is the earliest culture identified at 3.3 million years old, and the knappers flaked off pieces of cores made of basalt, phonolite, and trachyphonolite probably to use as a hammer to pound against an anvil. The Middle Pliocene of Woranso–Mille features grazing impalas, alcelaphins, and elephants, as well as browsing giraffes, tragelephins, and forest-dwelling monkeys. The feet of the bovid species do not seem to be specialised for any particular type of ground (such as wet, pliable, or hard), and the teeth of hoofed species indicates an equal abundance of grazers, browsers, and mixed feeders. These indicate a mixed environment features both open grasslands as well as forests probably growing on a lake- or riverside. Such a mosaic landscape is similar to A. anamensis and A. afarensis which seem to have no preferred environment. ==See also== * African archaeology * Ardipithecus ramidus * Australopithecus anamensis * Australopithecus afarensis * Australopithecus bahrelghazali * Kenyanthropus * Little Foot * List of fossil sites (with link directory) * List of human evolution fossils (with images) ==References External links == * Human Timeline (Interactive) – Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016) deyiremeda Category:Pliocene primates Category:Pliocene mammals of Africa Category:Fossils of Ethiopia Category:Mammals described in 2015 Category:Fossil taxa described in 2015 ","title":"Australopithecus deyiremeda"},{"id":"46816261","text":"Diedrich Wattenberg (13 June 1909 – 26 November 1996) was a German astronomer. He was a prolific populariser, writer and speaker on his subject, becoming in the 1950s a familiar presence on radio and, later, television programmes. ==Life== Wattenburg was born in a downstream suburb of Bremen during the first decade of the twentieth century. His father was a coppersmith. For economic reasons there was no possibility of his attending a secondary school, and he therefore trained for work as a government official. A decisive experience came in 1924 when Wattenburg attended a presentation by the writer Bruno H. Bürgel who was reading extracts from his autobiography: Bürgel's autobiography was entitled \\"Von Arbeiter zum Astronomen\\" (\\"From workers to astronomers\\"). Then in 1928, he got to know Friedrich Simon Archenhold at the Treptow Observatory (as it was then called) in Berlin. Wattenburg quickly became one of the regular contributors to a journal called \\"Das Weltall\\" (\\"The Universe\\") of which Archenhold was the editor in chef. Largely self-taught, during the 1930s he was writing regularly on astronomy. In 1946 the Treptow Observatory was renamed to honour Friedrich Archenhold, and on 1 June 1948 Diedrich Wattenburg was appointed Director of the Archenhold Observatory in succession to Hans Kienle, who a couple of years later moved to Heidelberg following the foundation, in 1949, of West and East Germany as separate stand-alone states. The observatory was in Potsdam which since 1945 had been part of the designated Soviet occupation zone and from 1949 till 1989 would be included in the German Democratic Republic. In addition to his Potsdam appointment, in 1948 Diedrich was appointed President of the Bremen centred Olbers Society, an astronomical group of which he had been a member since 1927. He also belonged to the Berlin Astronomical Society. The year after Wattenburg took over at the observatory, the first copy of a regular observatory newsletter under the name \\"Mitteilungen\\" appeared. Also in 1949 he founded the \\"Astronomical News Service\\" (\\"Astronomischen Nachrichtendienst\\") in response to what he saw as a shortage of newspapers and books on his topic. Arguably of even great importance were the little books and \\"brochures\\" which he had been publishing since 1947, giving a wide public access to developments in the field of astronomical research, at a time when many people were living as refugees and organised entertainment was in short supply. He also regularly contributed material to enthusiasts' magazines including Die Sterne, Die Himmelswelt, Natur und Kultur, Stimmen der Zeit and (still) Das Weltall. On 23 August 1951 his contribution was recognised with the award of the Goethe Prize by the Berlin city authorities. Wattenburg continued in charge at the Archenhold Observatory until November 1976, the month of his 67th birthday, heading up the reconstruction necessary after 1945. He continued to write, so that by the end of his career he had published 2,800 pieces of written work, and he continued to make appearances on the broadcast media. The focus of his work became, increasingly, the history of astronomy. It was as a result of an initiative by Wattenburg that the history of astronomy appeared on the school currilca in the country's Polytechnic Secondary Schools (\\"Polytechnische Oberschule\\")s for children in Years 9 and 10. ==Awards and honours== Diedrich Wattenburg was a recipient of the Leibniz Medal in 1980. By this time he had already been honoured with the Patriotic Order of Merit, in Silver, in 1964. ==Autobiography== Diedrich Wattenburg's autobiography appeared in 1984 under the title \\"Starry Heaven above me - inextricably in my life.('' \\"Gestirnter Himmel über mir – unverlierbares aus meinem Leben\\"). ==References== Category:20th-century astronomers Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit Category:1909 births Category:1996 deaths Category:German astronomers Category:People from Bremen ","title":"Diedrich Wattenberg"},{"id":"46816270","text":"Rosman Alwi (born 5 December 1961) is a Malaysian former cyclist.

It prevents accumulation of the red photoactivated form of orange carotenoid protein (OCP), thereby reducing the amount of fluorescence quenching that occurs between the OCP and the phycobilisome antenna complexes. It interacts with the C-terminal domain of OCP, which shares homology with the NTF2 superfamily. == Function == FRP is constitutively active, both in vivo and in vitro. It is able to prevent quenching of phycobilin fluorescence by OCP in vitro. Overexpression of FRP in Synechocystis PCC 6803 leads to an absence of fluorescence quenching. Deletion mutants of FRP show a slightly larger degree of fluorescence quenching induced by strong blue-green light, but was unable to restore fluorescence levels when transferred to low-light or darkness. == Structure == The protein is all alpha-helical, and the protein structure from Synechocystis was solved in 2013, showing both a dimer as well as a tetramer form in the same crystal used for X-ray diffraction. It is believed that the dimer is the active form. In the tetramer structure, one of the alpha helices is extended, disrupting the structure of a conserved patch of amino acids that is suggested to be an active site. Among these conserved residues, a histidine at position 53 and an arginine residue at position 60 have been shown to be essential for activity. Mutations in several other residues within this patch led to poor expression and precipitation, as well as loss of activity. == Genomics == The gene for FRP is commonly found immediately downstream of OCP, although a CrtW-like B-carotene ketolase gene is occasionally found between the OCP and FRP. The FRP gene is transcribed independently from OCP in Synechocystis 6803 and thus the OCP/FRP locus is not considered an operon. == Hypotheses == * Tetramerization may inactivate some of the FRP, and could thereby serve as a regulatory switch to permit NPQ to occur. This could occur by structural changes caused by differences in cellular pH or redox that commonly occur under high-light stress. * FRP may trigger inactivation of OCP by gathering the two domains of OCP back together, although no interaction with the N-terminal domain of OCP has been detected. * FRP may drive the conversion of OCP back to its inactive orange form by affecting the carotenoid. == References == Category:Bacterial proteins ","title":"Fluorescence recovery protein"},{"id":"46816329","text":"Victor (Vic) Nees (pronounced [neˑs]) (Mechelen, March 8, 1936 – Vilvoorde, March 14, 2013) was a Belgian (Flemish) composer (mainly of choral music), choral conductor, musicologist, and music educator. ==Early life and education== Vic Nees's father was Staf Nees, a famous Belgian carillonist, composer and organist. His early musical education was intense but informal. He had piano and organ lessons, and after taking a preparatory course of solfège by Paul Gilson he became a member of the cathedral choir of St. Rumbold's, then conducted by Jules Van Nuffel, who greatly impressed him. Of equal importance in his education were his father's musical friends and acquaintances; they included Marinus de Jong, Jef van Hoof, and Arthur Meulemans. But until 1956 he was mainly self-taught, using his father's library of scores and recordings. His interest in classical and romantic music was short-lived; very quickly it turned to the moderns of the day, like Milhaud, Hindemith, Bartók and especially Stravinsky; later also Britten. As a young teenager he already substituted for his father, away on concert tours, at the organ of the Basilica of Our Lady of Hanswijk. His father also drafted him as an accompanist at rehearsals of a choir he conducted. After one year of study at the Arts Faculty of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, he enrolled at the Antwerp Royal Flemish Conservatoire (now the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp) in 1956, intending to become a qualified music teacher. The degree did not yet exist, but in Antwerp Marcel Andries, whom he had met at home, was offering a pioneering program of music education that greatly interested him. At the Conservatoire he obtained degrees in solfège, harmony, counterpoint, fugue and music history. But when the Belgian state refused to recognize Andries' music education program with a formal degree, he quit. He kept in touch with Andries, however, whose influence on a generation of Flemish choral conductors played a major role in changing the practice of choral music in Flanders, substantially broadening its repertoire and turning it away from late romanticism, and having his choir members sing in a cleaner, leaner manner. ==Career Radio and conducting === In 1961, while doing his military service—at the time Belgium still had conscription—he passed an exam organized by the Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep (BRT) [later split up in a francophone section and the Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie (VRT)] and he was hired as a music producer, responsible for both \\"light\\" and \\"serious\\" music. But when BRT started its classical channel, Radio 3,Now called Klara. on October 1, 1961, Nees was assigned to Radio 3, where he was to concentrate on classical music, and especially choral music. In this position he became acquainted with a great many new compositions, of which composers sent recordings to the radio, hoping they would be broadcast. Meanwhile, he cut his teeth as a conductor. He founded the Vocal Ensemble Philippus de Monte in 1961—he'd conduct it for nine years—and from 1963 till 1965 he also led the Brussels Terkamerenkoor, consisting of professionals, members of the BRT choir. But dissatisfied as he was with his technique, he enrolled in Kurt Thomas's \\"Meisterkurs für Chorleitung\\" in Hamburg in 1964, from which he returned a laureate. His reputation as a choral conductor grew fast. As early as the 1960s he was invited to sit on the juries of international choral competitions (see below, § 6). His work with choirs was also noted by Léonce Gras, the conductor of the BRT Philharmonic Orchestra, who occasionally asked him to rehearse the BRT choir when preparing works for choir and orchestra. Upon the sudden death of Jan Van Bouwel, the conductor of the BRT choir, on December 1, 1969, Vic Nees was asked to replace him temporarily. For a while Nees combined the functions of music producer and choral conductor, but on October 19, 1970, his appointment as conductor became permanent and full-time. The BRT being a national institution, Nees's task included making music by Belgian (and later specifically Flemish composersA communiqué published after his death by the Flemish Minister for Environment, Nature and Culture Joke Schauvliege paid tribute to him for being \\"solicitous about our musical heritage and the legacy of our composers.\\" (Quote translated.)). This suited Nees. He was interested in discovering little-known repertoire, and he could afford to ignore popular works, as he made mainly studio recordings and did not have to worry about filling a concert hall. At first he regularly programmed old music, too, but with the rise of ensembles specialized in that field, he mostly left it to them. Most of the little known repertoire he mined was 20th century music—Dewilde (2011:98–99) lists over three dozen living Flemish composers he programmed—and, surprisingly perhaps, 19th and early 20th century romanticism. His instinctive aversion to much romantic music was not, however, to romanticism itself, but to a type of romanticism that lacked artistic quality but was praised to the skies for pandering to nationalist and religious feelings. He unearthed and performed a great many works, shorter pieces as well as major works, of Flemish romantic composers whose scores exhibited real artistic quality, like Joseph Ryelandt's Maria, Arthur Wilford's Liebeslieder im Mai and Herbstwinde, Franz Uyttenhove's Stabat Mater, Karel Candael's Het Marialeven and Oscar Roels's Prometheus. He was offered teaching positions at the conservatories of Antwerp and Brussels, but he refused them. As he preferred to maintain only his position as conductor of the radio choir, which gave him time to discover unknown works and above all to compose. This position, however, had its disadvantages because the radio choir was, and is, a chamber choir of professionals who are employees of the radio; they are civil servants. Motivating such a group, week after week, to sing mainly little known works or even premieres is hard work, especially when the choir was rarely able to sing for a public audience —it was only in the late 1980s that the choir started to regularly sing in concerts or went on tours. In 1991 the very existence of the choir was threatened; government economy measures suggested that the choir be merged with that of the Vlaamse Opera. From 1988 till the end of his career Nees got little support from Alexander Rahbari, at the time conductor of the Flemish Radio Orchestra, who was not very choir-minded. But Nees stayed for over 25 years. His farewell concert was on March 30, 1996. He conducted his own Psalm 91 Bonum est confiteri (1988) and De Feesten van angst en pijn (The Feasts of Fear and Pain), Op. 96, an oratorio by Willem Kersters, the only work Nees ever commissioned while a conductor of the Radio Choir. In his position he would not favor any composer, but he did want his old friend Kersters to be part of this celebration. Nees was only a permanent conductor for the Vocal Ensemble Philippus de Monte, the Terkamerenkoor and the BRT choir. But he conducted innumerable choirs as guest conductor. ===Composer=== Vic Nees considered himself a composer, first and foremost; being quoted having said \\"I conduct to make a living, and I live to compose.\\"Translated from Cooremans 2011:31. Most of Nees's works were written with certain occasions or certain performers in mind. Being an experienced choral conductor, he never lost sight of the capabilities and limitations of his intended performers. But even his works explicitly intended for amateurs never descend to the level of \\"occasional\\" works. Nees owed his many commissions to the fact that professionals as well as amateurs commissioning a work from him knew that \\"The risk that they would receive a piece of work that would be qualitatively below par or technically unperformable [was] virtually non- existent.Translated from Cooremans 2011:42. They also knew that they could expect the score of the work they commissioned to arrive months before the deadline.Unsigned obituary on the website of Koor & Stem, a Flemish organization fostering choral music. — The list of people or organizations that commissioned works by Nees includes BRT, the Cork International Choral Festival, the Escolania de Montserrat, Europa Cantat, the Neerpelt European Music Festival for Young People (a dozen commissions), the Festival of Flanders, the Flemish Federation of Young Choirs, the International Choir Contest of Flanders-Maasmechelen, the Flemish province of the Society of Jesus, The Swingle Singers, the \\"Ministerie van de Vlaamse Gemeenschap\\" (Civil Service of the Flemish Community), and a great many amateur choirs, most of them Flemish, but also quite a few Dutch ones. Nees wrote a great deal of sacred music, both for the liturgy and for the concert hall. It tends to be austere and to seek philosophical depth. So does some of his secular work, but it is mostly joyous, carefree and often full of subtle humor, irony and wordplay. Nees's works are performed widely, both at home and abroad. His popularity in Flanders is such that one of his obituaries claimed that \\"all choirs in Flanders have doubtless performed Vic Nees\\".Translated from the unsigned obituary on the website of Koor & Stem. ===Musicology=== His most important work as a musicologist was without doubt, his unearthing and preparing performance editions of forgotten works (see § 3), \\"in which he often proved himself to be a better musicologist than many who boast the university degree.\\"Dewilde 2011:83. His performance editions were primarily meant for the BRT choir—his was musicological work that paid off. He also published a few musicological articles. ===Music education=== Nees never held a teaching position, but he constantly provided musical education, in a number of ways. He lectured, taught courses, gave masterclasses and workshops for various organizations, on many of whose committees he sat. Thanks to all these activities he was able to serve as a bridge between the worlds of the professional and the amateur choir. In this he was also helped by a long- running monthly BRT 3 program, Het koorleven in Vlaanderen (Choral Life in Flanders), which he was a driving force of. The advice he gave privately may have been as influential. He was very approachable and he gave advice to whoever asked for it, informally over a good glass, in a serious conversation, in a letter or an e-mail. He was often asked to sit on juries of musical competitions, not only in Flanders (where his jury \\"duties\\" were too numerous to count) and in Wallonia, but also abroad: in Den Bosch (1963), The Hague (1967), Middlesbrough (1968), Cork International Choral Festival (1971), Arezzo (1988), Neuchâtel and Aosta (2006); Cooremans (2011:48) also lists Arnhem, Tours, Malta and Caracas without dates. All his jury reports were teaching moments. Nees was a fine writer and he was frequently asked to provide introductions to works or texts by others, in memoriams or eulogies. He also wrote a number of columns about music, which were quite popular. Their tone was light-hearted, but his purpose was often serious: he used many of them to subtly lobby for Flemish music ==Musical style== There are some features that are characteristic of all of Nees's works. There is, first and foremost, his almost exclusive preference for writing vocal music. For Nees that preference implied that he treated the human voice with great respect. Obviously he was fastidious in his choice of texts: \\"He often spen[t] more time finding a suitable text than setting it.\\"Translated from Cooremans 2011:47. Some texts he commissioned. Three of his favorite text writers were Albert Boone, SJ, a musicologist and conductor, Mieke Martens, a poet and member of the BRT choir, and Jo Gisekin (pen name of Leentje Vandemeulebroecke), a well-known Flemish poet whose work has also been set to music by Ernest van der Eyken and Wilfried Westerlinck. But he also wrote quite a few texts himself. A fourth characteristic was that he always strove to achieve coherence of form. Yet there are clear turning points in his career as a composer, the first around 1970, when he entered an experimental phase. He had begun his career by writing almost exclusively a cappella music for choirs, but around 1970 he added to his works solo voices, narrators and instrumental soloists, often in unusual combinations. He also began to write clusters, passages to be sung or spoken aleatorically, some of which even required changing the order of the syllables of the words. Around 1975 he entered a phase that could be termed neoromantic. His interest in innovation lessened, that in lyricism and singable melody increased. He also took up composing art songs, a genre he had not practiced since his youth. But in 1978 he also wrote Lesbia, a resolutely dissonant and jazzy work written for The Swingle Singers. His 1980 Magnificat—his most frequently performed work in the thirty years following its creation—heralds yet another period, which Nees himself termed \\"new simplicity\\". It brought a major return to diatonic writing, but also a first confrontation with minimal music, like that of Philip Glass and Steve Reich, and also with the music of Krzysztof Penderecki and Henryk Górecki. Minimal music was to have a major place in Nees's work from then on. ==Personal life== In 1960 he married Lea De Keersmaecker, with whom he had two daughters, Ineke and Saskia.Cf. this in memoriam. His wife was his constant and conscientious archivist. == Works == His work list in Leens (2011), made with the help of Nees himself and that of his wife, lists all his works until 2013.

It was a thriving wholesale merchant partnership which included a grocery and dry goods store across from the Governor's PalaceSheri Goldstein Gleicher, \\"The Spiegelbergs of New Mexico: A Family Story of the Southwestern Frontier,\\" Southwest Jewish History Vol. 1, No. 2, (Winter, 1992)Bureau of Immigration for the Territorial Fair, The Resources of New Mexico (1881) p.45 It was the first Jewish mercantile company in Santa Fe. The Spiegelberg brothers expanded to include four other brothers. They served as sutlers to the American military and as Indian traders. They later established and were major stockholders in the Second National Bank of Santa Fe.Sharon Niederman, A Quilt of Words: Women's Diaries, Letters & Original Accounts of Life in the Southwest, 1860-1960 (1988) The reach of their numerous investments and the bank have been described as a regional business empire, spreading across large parts of the Southwest.Harald Zapf, Klaus Lösch (eds.) Cultural Encounters in the New World (2003) Investments included mining operations, insurance, and real estate ventures. ==Spiegelberg Family in New Mexico== Soloman Jacob Spielberg was the oldest of a family of ten children and the first to leave Germany. He arrived in Santa Fe via an ox train along the Santa Fe Trail. He worked there for E. Leitendorfer and company, or Houghton & Leidensdorfer Co. of St. Louis, until joining the Doniphan campaign to Chihuahua, for whom he may have acted as sutler. During the campaign, he used his savings and credit to outfit his goods and transportation, allowing him an opportunity to engage in southern trade.Harriet Rochlin, Fred Rochlin, Pioneer Jews: A New Life in the Far West (2000) Following the war, he was appointed as sutler for the United States Army at Fort Marcy. Levi arrived in New Mexico in 1848, when Spigelberg Brothers was founded, followed by Elias (1850), Emmanuel (1853), Lehman (1857), and the youngest, Willi (1861).Malcolm Ebright, Advocates for the Oppressed: Hispanos, Indians, Genízaros, and Their Land in New Mexico (2014) By 1852 Solomon Jacob was doing well enough to advance the territorial legislature four thousand dollars to pay its members salaries, until repaid within the following year.Henry J. Tobias, A History of the Jews in New Mexico (1990) In addition to managing Spiegelberg Brothers, the brothers established themselves as traders with the Native Americans. The first trading license at Fort Defiance was issued to Lehman after the Navajos were moved to the reservation in the summer 1868. Willi was the first trader at Fort Wingate, also in the summer of 1868, and later became sutler to the Navajo Indian Agency. Floyd S. Fierman wrote that the Spiegelbergs revolutionized the retail business and its territory, attracting many Spanish-Americans from the villages into the towns, where they could buy either for cash or on credit without feeling cheated, or losing their land if they fell behind in their payments.Floyd S. Fierman, The Spiegelbergs: Pioneer Merchants and Bankers in the Southwest (1967) Willi's wife, Flora, recalled that all five brothers joined the Masonic order, and that in the early fifties, Solomon was among its first members. Spiegelberg mining interests dated from the early 1860s. In 1861 Soloman Jacob and Levi joined investors incorporating the Montezuma Copper Mining Company of Santa Fé, New Mexico, and Lehman served on the board of directors of the Willison Silver Mining Company in 1872. Lehman's acquisition of the San Marcos Pueblo grant may have been stimulated by his interest in copper mining. During the Civil War, Levi, while en route to Chihuahua with a wagon train of merchandise, was captured by General Henry Hopkins Sibley's Confederate forces near Socorro, within days following the Battle of Valverde. He was charged with being a Union spy, but was recognized by a former Secretary of the Territory of New Mexico, Colonel A. M. Jackson, and released. The brothers suffered heavy mercantile business losses during this New Mexico Campaign of 1862, especially in Albuquerque. However, they still managed to prosper through their government contracts, insurance and mining investments, and their Santa Fe banking and exchange house.Jerry D. Thompson, New Mexico Territory During the Civil War: Wallen and Evans Inspection Reports, 1862-1863 (2008) The Spiegelbergs were appointed sutlers to the New Mexico Volunteers between July 1861 and July 1864. Flora Spiegelberg recalled that during the occupation of Santa Fe, more than fifty thousand dollars in merchandise passed from the Spiegelbergs into Confederate hands. Until 1870, large merchants filled the role of the non-existent banks of New Mexico. Large purchases often involved the use of property as security, in essence, mortgage banking. The Spiegelbergs issued their own highly respected company scrip as substitutes for legal tender in 1863, when the territorial legislative assembly granted a provisional charter to create the Bank of New Mexico, but failed to gain congressional approval. Levi Spiegelberg was among the ten prominent New Mexicans seeking that charter. In 1870, the First National Bank of New Mexico received a charter under Lucien Maxwell in Santa Fe, which was taken over within months by Thomas B. Catron, one of the largest individual landholders in U.S. history, with Stephen Benton Elkins and others. The Spiegelbergs quickly formed the Second National Bank of New Mexico in 1872, with principal (and majority interest holding) stockholders, Lehman and Willie in Santa Fe, and Solomon and Levi, in New York. The wealth of the Spiegelbergs may be compared to other prominent New Mexicans of the time. That reported by Ceran St. Vrain in 1860 was $200,000; the Dold brothers of Las Vegas, $76,500 each; Solomon Spiegelberg, $65,000. In 1870 Lucien Boneparte Maxwell's stated wealth was $170,000, while Lehman Speigelberg reported $77,000. Elias accidentally died while he slept when a roof collapsed upon him. Beginning in the late 1860s and early 1870s most of the remaining brothers began moving to New York City where they continued their business practices.William Aloysius Keleher, Violence in Lincoln County, 1869-1881 (2007) Lehman wrote the Commerce of Sta Fé, MS., a sketch of his journey across the plains, and his observations of trading matters in early times, with a general idea of the country's progress in other respects.Hubert Howe Bancroft, Arizona and New Mexico 1530-1888, in the series History of the Pacific States of North America, Vol.12 Levi and wife Betty moved their family to New York, where Levi established L. Spiegelberg & Sons with sons Charles S. and William I., who married Beulah V. Guggenheim.John William Leonard, History of the City of New York, 1609-1909 (1910) p.805 Willi served as the first mayor of Santa Fe (1884-1886). Willi's wife Flora left a diary with vivid descriptions of the cultural life of Santa Fe during the period. She began the town's first nonsectarian school for girls and also taught pupils in Hebrew school, including Arthur Seligman, future governor of New Mexico. In 1888 Willi moved his family to New York. ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Spiegelbergs of New Mexico: A Family Story of the Southwestern Frontier, Southwest Jewish Archives, University of Arizona Category:New Mexico Territory ","title":"Spiegelberg Brothers"},{"id":"46816484","text":"TwinFocus Capital Partners LLC is a multi family office based in Boston, Massachusetts.

(written by Jon Scieszka, Viking Books, 1989). She then designed Smith's The Big Pets and Glasses Who Needs 'Em? (Viking Books, 1991) before designing what would arguably be her most visible work, The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales (Viking Books, 1992). In a 2002 Publishers Weekly article, \\"A New Day for Design,\\" book designer Isabel Warren-Lynch echoed many of her colleagues when she said, \\"[Designer] Molly Leach opened the door in a lot of ways. When we saw The Stinky Cheese Man, designers said, 'This is what we want to do, too!' — and that it worked and sold made that possible.\\" The Stinky Cheese Man is widely cited as having moved children's design into a new era.\\"A New Day for Design\\" - Publisher's Weekly In a 1998 essay in the Horn Book Magazine, \\"Design Matters,\\" Jon Scieszka stated, \\"The job of a designer, in its most basic form, is to pick the style, size, and color of type, maybe pick the kind of paper and size of the book, and arrange how the type and illustrations are to be displayed on the pages available. But Molly does so much more than that in our books. When she’s done, the design tells as much of the story as the text and illustrations do.\\"\\"Design Matters\\" - Horn Book Magazine In his book Side by Side (Walker Publishing 2001), Leonard S. Marcus stated, \\"Leach liked bold, headline-sized type like that often used for magazines. She thought that unusually big, dramatic type best communicated the fun of stories in which things continually went haywire. And she wanted each page to feel as if it were ready to burst at the margins.\\"Leonard S. Marcus - Side by Side at Google Books In the same book Jon Scieszka is quoted, \\"People leafing through The Stinky Cheese Man would see that something different was going on — and realize that a good part of that 'something' was Molly's design.\\" Smith seconded this with, \\"Jon and I both appreciate goofy, second-grade humor. If it were up to us, we would use all comic-book type or hand lettered type made of twigs. Molly, with her background in magazine design is different. She'll take what we do — and make it classy.\\"Leonard S. Marcus - Side by Side at Google Books Steven Heller and Steven Guarnaccia state in Designing for Children (1994, Watson-Guptill), \\"while Smith's drawings are artfully primitive... it is the book design by Molly Leach that is the BRUTest of all... the type varies in weight, size and leading, but there are other witty tricks: for instance, where there isn't enough text to fill a page it is repeated, and when the character Chicken Licken is introduced the type, not the sky, falls on her head.\\" Other notable book designs by Leach are her redesigns of new editions of the complete Roald Dahl books; Jack Gantos's Joey Pigza books; a Dr. Seuss treasury, Your Favorite Seuss: A Baker's Dozen by the One and Only Dr. Seuss; and the 50th anniversary edition of A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle. == Books designed by Leach == * The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!

This problem does not occur at the one-country level.. Suppose the number of countries in the world is n. Because this world is closed, one country's balance of payments surplus must be equal to another's deficit, and vice versa. Thus the sum of all countries' net payments positions must be zero. Therefore, if n − 1 countries out of n countries have determined their balances of payments, that of the nth country is determined automatically.. This fact implies that, if all of the n countries have payments objectives, only n − 1 countries can achieve the payments objectives. In other words, all of the payments objectives can not be achieved simultaneously. Similarly, if there are n currencies in the world, only n − 1 exchange rates can be \\"independent\\" because the exchange rate is a price of one money relative to another. Other rates which are not independent are calculated as cross rate. There are only n − 1 countries to be determined, which implies the n th country is required to refrain from intervening its exchange rate. Benign neglect is one example for this fact. Note that this problem exists only in bilateral exchanges. With trilateral (and higher order) currency exchanges, each country can be given an equal amount of first mover opportunities. For instance with four countries performing trilateral currency exchanges (for instance countries A, B, C, and D) there are four unique groups of three countries (ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD). In an ABC trilateral exchange, country A can be given first mover priority, in an ABD exchange, country B can be first mover, in an ACD exchange, country C can be first mover, and in a BCD exchange, country D can be first mover. This works with any number of countries using trilateral currency exchanges. For n countries there are (n x (n - 1) x (n - 2)) / 6 unique groups of three individual countries. For instance for 11 countries there are (11 x (11 - 1) x (11 - 2)) / 6 = 165 unique groups of three individual countries. And so in that group of 11 countries, each country could be first mover for 165 / 11 = 15 trading triangles. Note that equal opportunity to be first mover only occurs when the number of countries is not a whole multiple of 3. For 6 countries there are (6 x (6 - 1) x (6 - 2)) / 6 = 20 unique groups of three individual countries. 20 is not evenly divisible across the six countries. With trilateral currency exchanges there is not a fixed bilateral exchange rate (X Dollars per Peso or it's inverse Y Pesos per Dollar). Instead there is a set of currency triplings (A Dollars -> B Pesos -> C Rubles for instance). The actual Dollar / Peso ratio will vary based upon which tripling it is part of. From a game theory perspective, it is in the interest of all countries to maintain stable currency pair exchange rates. With trilateral currency exchanges, no one country has overweight influence on how those currency pair exchange rates are established. ==References== * Category:Financial economics Category:International economics Category:International finance ","title":"Redundancy problem"},{"id":"46816693","text":"Tuskar is a river in the Kursk Oblast of Russia and the third largest tributary of the Seym.

Charles Debbasch (born 22 October 1937 in Tunis), is a French jurist and academic. == Biography  Academic === He graduated with a degree in law at 24 and then taught administrative law and political institutions at the Paul Cézanne University for more than forty years. He was also a professor at the College of Europe and in foreign faculties. He has authored works on administrative law and constitutional law. Charles Debbasch founded the specialist field of media law in France. As dean of the faculty of law at Aix-Marseille, he was one of the founders of Paul Cézanne University (of which he was president). He has supervised numerous theses. He also directed a laboratory of CNRS, where he was a director and administrative council member. === Public roles === A specialist in state functions and institutions, Charles Debbasch has exercised numerous public functions. He was employed by Edgar Faure, minister of education after the university crisis of May 1968, and then was an advisor for education and culture to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing during his seven-year rule. He was involved in the art world and initiated the creation of the Museum of Yves Brayer in Baux-de-Provence. He was also employed in the media, serving successively as Vice-President of FR3, Director-General and then President of Le Dauphiné libéré. He established several radio stations in Rhône-Alpes and Provence, which were subsequently integrated into the Skyrock and Fun Radio networks. Charles Debbasch also made an incursion into politics in the 1983 French municipal elections: he stood in Aix-en-Provence, obtaining 5.77% of the vote.Vincent Hugeux, p.246; Monde 14 March 1989, p.15. === Fondation Vasarely Affair === As dean of the faculty of law at Aix-en-Provence and President of Paul Cézanne University, professor Debbasch was chosen by the university to take on the presidency of the Fondation Vasarely. With the agreement of the administrative council he held the role from 1981 until 1992. After the death of Claire Vasarely, wife of the painter, Vasarely's heirs took control of the organisation and called the role of Debbasch into question. In 1993 they obtained a judicial annulment of his administrative mandate. They also sought criminal proceedings against him.L'Humanité, 13 April 1993, (online ) In November 1994, when he appeared to give a press conference at the University of Aix-en-Provence on the Vasarely affair, the police arrived and attempted to challenge Debbasch's attempt to avail himself of a Letter rogatory. Alleging that the police had attempted to enter his vehicle by force without a permit, he ensconced himself in his faculty office under the guard of a group of students devoted to his cause. The judge La Gallo granted a summons on 27 November 1994.Facts related in the partial judgement of the European Court of Human Rights (third section), 27 April 2000. He was arrested on 28 November 1994 and detained at Baumettes Prison,L'Humanité, 28 & 29 November 1994, articles available online : Le doyen Debbasch campe dans son son bureau- l'Humanite , L'ex-doyen Debbasch est en prison pour escroquerie- l'Humanite . where he continued to be imprisoned in provisional detention until 15 February.The date of Dean Dabbasch's release appears in a catalogue of TV news stories prepared by the INA (online). Brought before the criminal court on charges of fraud, forgery and breach of trust, Charles Debbasch was condemned on 20 February 2002. This condemnation was essentially confirmed by the Aix-en-Provence court of appeal, which dismissed the charge of fraud but retained the other two charges.The judgement is online on the website of the \\" association pour la défense et la promotion de l'œuvre de Vasarely \\" : www.vasarely.net and www.vasarely.net . The judgment was annulled the next year, but only in the aspects relating to forgery; it was definitive concerning the condemnation of Debbasch for breach of trust and in requiring civil reparations for the amount he owed (€405,000 on his sole charge and €214,028 jointly with Pierre Lucas who was condemned along with him).\\"All other judgements were expressly maintained \\", specified in the Criminal Court judgement of 7 January 2003. This judgement may be accessed online on the site of Legifrance. After this partial overturning of the decision, the case went before the Court of Appeal of Aix-en-Provence, which condemned Charles Debbasch solely on the charge of breach of trust on 11 May 2005, sentencing him to two years in prison, including one year of suspended in exchange for three years probation, along with a fine of €150,000 and a five-year abrogation of certain civic, civil and family rights.Dispatch of AFP, 14 May 2005, online on Art Investors, along with the judgement of the Court of Cassation of 14 December 2005, rejecting an appeal against the judgement of 14 May 2005, online on Legifrance. Vincent Hugeux indicatesPage 255 that this was not Charles Debbasch's first legal trouble. According to him, he was also convicted in 1980, by the Court of Appeal of Paris for counterfeiting – he had published the same legal treatise with two different publishing houses. Finally, Le Monde made an inquiry concerning a suspicious depositof 1.2 million euros in cash in a Luxumbourgish account, which was then transferred to three trusts based in Niue, an investigation which resulted in an indictment for \\"money laundering and fraudulent organisation of insolvency.\\".Le Monde 4 April 2003, Frédéric Vézard; Le Parisien 19 April 2003, p. 16; AFP 16 April 2003. Debbasch denied that the transactions were in any way fraudulent, declaring that the funds were not linked to the Vasarely affair but reflected fees paid for his assistance to the Republic of Togo and the Embassy of Togo to the Benelux. This was duly confirmed by the Togolese treasury.Charles Debbasch's viewpoint is extensively reported in Le Parisien, 15 May 2003. === Africa === He advised numerous African Heads of State and edited several African constitutions. At the direction of King Hassan II he directed a group of jurists in Morocco from 1981 to 1985 charged with training the crown prince, now Muhammed VI in comparative law. He also served in an advisory role in Cote d'Ivoire for presidents Félix Houphouët-Boigny and Henri Konan Bédié.Vincent Hugeux, p. 248. At the end of the 1990s, he advised Omar Bongo, President of Gabon and was contracted by the Republic of Congo to help edit their new constitution.La Lettre du Continent, 17 December 1998. He later received Togolese citizenship.Vincent Hugeux, p. 241. After serving on the legal council of Togolese President Eyadema, he became a Special Advisor to the Togolese Head of State Faure Gnassingbé – a position which he retains to this day.As indicated on the website of the Togolese presidency . Asked by the newspaper La Croix in 2007 about the advisability of retaining a man condemned by French law as an advisor, Faure Gnassingbé was explicit in responding that \\"It is not within the African worldview to rid oneself of anyone who has long been loyal.\\".La Croix, 25 June 2007. His detractors accuse him of being the \\"inspiration – if not the author\\" of the Togolese Constitution,This phrase used by Philippe Bernard in a precis of Charles Debbasch published in Le Monde, 7 July 2006. but he denies this and insists on putting his role in perspective.In an interview with Vincent Hugeux, who cites him p.251-252. He appeared to play a crucial role in the \\"constitutional coup d'État\\" by which Faure Gnassingbé succeeded his father, general Eyadéma, who had ruled Togo for thirty-eight years, in February 2005,In a response published on 3 July 2007 in Le Monde, Charles Debbasch argued that this was not correct and that he was not in Togo at all in the hours following Gnassingbé Eyadema's death. in an affair in which it is difficult to separate fact from journalistic exaggeration.An article by Bryan Mealer on 23 February 2005 spread by the Associated Press, describes the involvement of Charles Debbasch in the events of 2005, presenting him in a commanding role. The article is online on the website of France Watcher; the article reports the opinion of the opposition leader Harry Olympio: for him Charles Debbasch had \\"total control\\" over the Togolese government and was under the armed guard because, without this, \\"the Togolese would kill him on sight.\\" On the other hand, in Le Monde on 7 July 2006, Philippe Bernard used rather more nuance, stressing that Charles Debbasch \\"was not necessarily the controlling influence that some have thought him to be.\\" In the media, Debbasch has been termed a \\"white collar mercenary.\\"Sur 27avril.comLe Monde (11.05.2005)Report of the African Union cited by the Canard enchaîné, 10 May 2006 === Since 2005 === Debbasch has been mentioned in the media on several occasions for several reasons. Firstly, in the Marseilles press: Marseille l'Hebdo reported in 2006 that Charles Debbasch had continued to receive his salary as a university professor although he was resident in Togo, since he had was responsible for the University of Aix- Marseille's co-operative exchanges with the Universities of Lomé and Kara. According to the author of the article, sources close to the President of the University admitted that \\"all the world knows that these exchanges are completely fictional\\" and that it was \\"a political decision that had been made at a higher level.\\".Marseille l'Hebdo n° 287, 26 April 2006, Fred Guilledoux. Abstract online on Pressafrique. On 16 May 2007, Charles Debbasch was arrested at Brussels airport, where he was preparing to depart for Lomé, and was placed under court supervision with a ban on leaving Belgium.Le Figaro 19 May 2007, online. This affair was quickly resolved, since Charles Debbasch returned to Lomé a little over a week later.An interview with his account online on republicoftogo.com, website of the Togolese Republic. Togolese sources defend Charles Debbasch, who still swears that he is totally innocent of the charges laid against him,The account in Chronique d'un désastre judiciaire by Charles Debbasch himself for his supporters, available online (consulted 2 December 2007), presents the Vasarely affair, as a \\"Cultural Outreau,\\" even attributing Debbasch's conviction as \\"a corporate and mafia plot in which Aixoise officials were complicit.\\" and even launching a legal counter-offensive. The website of the Togolese Republic, republicoftogo.com, reports that Charles Debbasch launched a counterattack, first by filing a complaint of fraudulent judgementSee the interview of June 2007 online. and then – concerning the events in Belgium – against Michel de Bonnecorse, former advisor on African Affairs to Jacques Chirac.,See République Togolaise – Home. In the same article, M Debbasch declares \\"We have supplied the legal authorities with the name of a network of mercenaries who have paid pens and goons to question or to undermine my life.\\" In its edition of 10 May 2006, the Canard enchaîné Alain Guédé published an article (L'université française finance l'exil doré d'un condamné), mentioning the Vasarely affair once more and stating that his salary continued to be paid by the state education department (€5000 / month from 2003 to 2006) in accordance with an agreement between Paul Cézanne University (Jacques Bourdon) and Togo. === Personal life === Charles Debbasch was born in Tunisia to a European family which resettled in Aix-en-Provence at independence. He studied at the Lycée Carnot in Tunis.Vincent Hugeux, p.245 He was married twice, and is now a widower.Vincent Hugeux, p. 247 He is father of five children,Caroline-Nelly Perrot, Report of AFP of 9 May 2005. Vincent Hugeux, p.247, says four children including the rector of the Académie de Lyon Roland Debbasch.Le Monde 15 April 1993, p.12. Debbasch appeared to Patricia Allémonière, a journalist at TF1 who interviewed him in Togo, as a \\"man of the old sort of France, a little worn, bruised by the ostracism which he feels victim of in Paris.\\"Vincent Hugeux, p. 251 His excellent manners did not prevent him from being mischievous, even prone to school-boy puns and jokes.Vincent Hugeux has two anecdotes, p.243. Finally, in what bordered on an affectation, Charles Debbasch very openly loved animals – Vincent Hugeux who encountered him in Kara reports his lover for the parakeet of the city's best hotelVincent Hugeux, p.237. (Debbasch also mentioned the bird in the title of his 2006 book: La succession d'Eyadema : le perroquet de Kara). During the Vasarely affair, articles dedicated to Charles Debbasch regularly mentioned his Yorkshire terrier Love, which he would carry under his arm when he encountered photo-journalists or cameramen,E.g. an article in Libération by Vincent Noce, 19 May 2007 (online). and later he wrote a book in tribute: Un amour de Love. Cinq ans avec mon yorkshire préféré.The book was the subject of a review in Libération, 13 December 2001, p.18. == Publications == * L'administration au pouvoir, fonctionnaires et politiques sous la Ve République, (The Administration of Power, Duties and Politics in the 5th Republic) Calmann-Lévy – Questions d'actualité, 1970. * L'Université désorientée, (The Confused University).

The initial portion of the book discusses a geography lesson in which the teacher points to the high altitude in which the school resides, and the teacher proclaims the apparent proximity to heaven. Julian Lucas of the New York Review of Books states that this foreshadows a fall from grace. The middle of the novel includes the Tutsi students' encounters with some men, and the final portion of the novel showcases an anti-Tutsi frenzy, orchestrated by Hutu student Gloriosa and assisted by a white teacher. Gloriosa had accidentally damaged a statue of Mary while trying to remove a nose deemed too Tutsi-like, referring to the notion of spiting one's face by cutting off one's nose. Character deaths are not directly depicted and are instead recounted by another character. A northern-origin student, Goretti, ends Gloriosa's campaign and becomes the leader of the school dormitory; this is a reference to the overthrow of Grégoire Kayibanda by Juvénal Habyarimana. Gloriosa's father becomes a prison inmate. Tom Zoellner of Chapman University argued that the beginning of the novel is \\"too preoccupied with stage-setting\\". ==Style== Christopher Byrd of Barnes & Noble Review stated that the novel uses a context leading up to the Rwandan massacre while also maintaining \\"a universal texture to the resentment, envy, and opportunism that are a part of any student body\\" through being a school story. Nick DiMartino wrote in Three Percent that Mukasonga included \\"chuckling good humor\\" and was \\"playful\\" in her writing. The novel uses many Kinyarwanda words, a feature retained in the English translation; LaRue stated that many writers in post-colonial countries intersperse words of indigenous languages into texts written in European languages, which is \\"interrupting\\" the colonial language. The English version also retains usage of some French words, such as lycée, giving it what LaRue describes as \\"another layer of “foreignness” to the text.\\" ==Characters== Publishers Weekly wrote that the characters are distinct and that a few characters \\"lack overt motivation for their nastiness\\". LaRue argued that some characters are \\"too schematic\\". Most of the characters are schoolgirls from wealthy families.\\"Our Lady of the Nile\\" (review). Publishers Weekly. September 29, 2014. Retrieved on 28 May 2015. Students include: * Veronica and Virginia (Mutamuriza) - The school's only Tutsi students, they face danger from increased anti-Tutsi sentiment. Veronica dies during anti-Tutsi violence, raped and burned to death at Fontenaille's place by a mob organized by Gloriosa, but Virginia is the sole Tutsi to survive. Virginia survives since an old man named Rubanga tells her to talk to the ghost of the queen Nyiramavugo, who tells her which Hutu people who will not harm her. ** LaRue described them as the \\"true protagonists\\" of the story. Mukasonga herself had been forced to leave her school in the 1970s. LaRue wrote that \\"In this respect, Virginia is something of Mukasonga’s alter ego\\". * Gloriosa - Gloriosa has influence from her powerful father, a Hutu, who is a prominent official in the Rwandan government. She often threatens the Tutsi students at the school. Gloriosa lies about being attacked by Tutsis. As the novel progresses she begins to order killings, beatings, and rapes, and she begins a programme of racial persecution. Gloriosa damages the statue that the school is named after since it has Tutsi features, and she represents Hutu extremism. Byrd stated that she is a \\"two-dimensional demagogue\\", and he describes her as the \\"de facto villain\\". LaRue wrote: \\"If as a character she seems less complex, less interesting than her fellow students, this is likely intentional.\\" * Goretti - A student from northern Rwanda, her father is a military official in charge of a base. Gloriosa is upset that a white researcher is involved so heavily with the gorillas while nobody else is to that degree; Lucas stated that the researcher \\"is likely Dian Fossey\\". This prompts Goretti to organize her own trip. She ends Gloriosa's campaign by taking control from her. * Frida - Frida's family works for the Rwandan state in the international relations sector. The Ambassador of Zaire courts Frida, wanting her to be his wife. He is a young man, and the two have sex in the bungalow at the school. They plan to marry, but before that happens Frida becomes pregnant. The incident causes a scandal at the school. * Modesta - a half-Hutu, half-Tutsi girl who is Gloriosa's friend * Immaculée - a student who has a boyfriend and wears revealing clothing Faculty: * Mother Superior - The head of the school * Father Herménégilde - A chaplain who is the head of Catholic Relief Services, Lucas describes him as \\"Gloriosa's Pygmalion\\". He supports Gloriosa's anti- Tutsi stances and commits himself to the Hutu cause. Herménégilde is sexually interested in his students. He gives gifts in exchange for allowing him to see the student naked. He assist Gloriosa when she has the school raided. * Olivier Lapointe - A hippie teacher from France * Sister Lydwine - The geography teacher Other characters: * Monsieur de Fontenaille - A white artist, described by Lucas as having \\"failed\\" and being a \\"colonial holdover\\", Fontenaille lives by himself on a former coffee plantation. He believes Tutsi people were descendants of pharaohs. He takes an interest in Veronica, and he enjoys making sketches of the students. Fontenaille tells Veronica that he will help her get a European education. While Gloriosa has the school raided, Veronica is at Fontenaille's residence. He kills himself with a noose before the mob appears. ** Lucas states that Fontenaille has \\"a morbid enchantment\\" with the possible complete disappearance of Tutsis even as he has \\"seeming concern\\" for Veronica's welfare. ==Reception== The book won the 2012 . It also won the Prix Renaudot, the French Voices Award, and the Océans France Ô prize. Judith Rosen of Publishers Weekly ranked it as one of \\"The Big Indie Books of Fall 2014\\".Rosen, Judith. \\"The Big Indie Books of Fall 2014.\\" Publishers Weekly, 22 August 2014. Retrieved on 28 May 2015. In 2016, the English translation was on the shortlist for the International Dublin Literary Award. Byrd stated that the \\"air of foreboding consequence that imparts urgency to almost every page\\" adds to the novel, and that \\"Mukasonga is a gifted storyteller with a sure sense of plot construction, and an aptitude for crafting piquant descriptions.\\" Byrd criticised the use of archetypes as characters, calling them \\"tendentious characterizations\\" and Byrd also argued that the dialog \\"skews too much to blatant declarations for my tastes\\". Rousseau wrote that the book was \\"Poignant et implacable\\" (poignant and harsh/implacable). Tom Zoellner of Chapman University stated that the book is an \\"outstanding work of African fiction\\", and that \\"Mukasonga is dead on target about Rwanda\\". According to Zoellner, the expository speeches were \\"clunky\\" and some characters made \\"stentorian proclamations that no self- respecting adolescent girl would attempt\\" and therefore \\"Mukasonga’s strength is generally not in dialogue.\\" LaRue stated that \\"we should[...]welcome the opportunity to read Mukasonga’s work in English\\", despite its minor flaws including \\" dialogue and exposition[that]are occasionally clumsy\\". John Taylor wrote in The Arts Fuse that Our Lady of the Nile is \\"well-constructed\\". He argued that the author used too pedagogical of an approach to explain the Hutu-Tutsi conflict but he said that was a minor complaint. Publishers Weekly wrote that Mukasonga \\"fully draws readers into the tensions, spirituality, and culture of Rwandan life from page one.\\" ==Film== The film adaptation of the novel is directed by Atiq Rahimi and stars Amanda Santa Mugabekazi, Albina Sydney Kirenga, Malaika Uwamahoro, Clariella Bizimana, Belinda Rubango Simbi, and Pascal Greggory.

First published in 1934, it is one of Vestdijk's most popular novels. It is the third installment in the Anton Wachter cycle, a series of eight novels whose protagonist is Anton Wachter, the author's alter ego. His entire existence as an artist, Vestdijk later wrote Theun de Vries, originates in his \\"Ina Damman experience\\". ==Content== Terug tot Ina Damman describes Wachter's first three years at the Hogere Burgerschool and his infatuation with a girl, Ina Damman. The boy, whose father has just died, lives in the town of Lahringen, based on Vestdijk's hometown Harlingen. The novel originates from Alleen tussen vier vrouwen (\\"Alone between four women\\"), Vestdijk's voluminous debut novel which was rejected by publishers; it covered the early part of Wachter's life including the Ina Damman episode. The titular character is based on a girl called Lies Koning, Vestdijk's schoolmate at the HBS in Harlingen and his unrequited love. The \\"four women\\" of his debut are considered representative of four erotic objects: the mother, the idealized dream woman, the flesh-and-blood lover, and the object of lust. Lies Koning, who rejected Vestdijk when he was fourteen, represents the second type. The novel consists of three parts: \\"Het woord\\" (\\"The word\\"), \\"Ina Damman\\", and \\"De overwinning\\" (\\"The victory\\"). The \\"word\\" of the first part is \\"vent\\" (\\"man\\", colloquially), Wachter's father's nickname for his son; the schoolchildren, prompted by the school bully, start calling Wachter \\"vent\\", singling him out and alienating him. He only learns to ignore them in the second year when he imagines himself in love with Ina Damman, whose real name is Antonia, and thus is a projection of the protagonist: \\"she embodies the ideal image he has of himself, the suspicion of his possibilities\\". One schoolyear long he walks her to the train station, carries her bag, exchanges a few words with her, until she dumps him. Wachter shifts his erotic desire to a domestic servant called Janke (a type of Else Böhler, who figures in a later Vestdijk novel). \\"The victory\\" delves into Wachter's idealization of one of the teachers, Greve; a fight with a schoolboy which he wins; and the ensuing success with formerly unattainable girls. This victory leads him back to himself—back to Ina Damman—which in turn allows him to remain grounded while accepting his sensitivity and his budding artistry. ==Legacy== The \\"classic novel\\" ranks #40 in the Canon of Dutch Literature (Vestdijk occupying #15 among authors). Maarten 't Hart's bestselling novel Een vlucht regenwulpen is considered a \\"modernized version\\" of Terug tot Ina Damman. In a lengthy review of Vestdijk's Else Böhler, Duitsch Dienstmeisje (1935), Menno ter Braak argued that the later novel is a sort of polar opposite of the earlier: \\"Anton Wachter, the schoolboy in his boy's world, in which the reality of the imagination can still conquer touch with life itself, has grown up in the new novel and is called Mr. Johan Roodenhuis; Ina Damman, the far-removed, platonic one has come frighteningly close and is called Else Böhler, German servant girl\\". In the 1950s and 1960s, Terug tot Ina Damman was one of the Vestdijk novels found on the reading list of every high school student in the Netherlands. Since then Vestdijk's popularity, and that of Ina Damman, has plummeted. ==References== Category:1934 novels Category:Dutch bildungsromans ","title":"Terug tot Ina Damman"},{"id":"46816752","text":"Andrew James Dunlop, Baron Dunlop (born 21 June 1959) is a British politician and life peer.

In 1865, he was enrolled at the local gymnasium, but failed his courses and transferred to the Realschule in Budweis, where he met a teacher who encouraged his artistic interests.Brief biography @ Rodon. In 1873, despite this, he followed his father's wishes and entered the Vienna Business School. He soon ignored his studies and spent more time at the local art schools, prompting his parents to bring him home to work in the family business. He was not deterred, however, and devoted his time to painting when his father was absent. Water Gnome (1886) Going against his family, he returned to Vienna in 1874 and audited classes at the Academy of Fine Arts. After further clashes with his father, he finally prevailed and was given the money to enroll. Carl Wurzinger and Josef Matyáš Trenkwald were among his instructors there. Some of his first works were purchased by Professor Hans Makart, but later attempts to be financially independent failed and he returned, penniless, to his hometown in 1881. Eventually, he found work as an illustrator and was able to visit the Netherlands in 1888, where he became interested in Dutch architecture and softened his painting style. The following year, Joža Uprka invited him to visit Moravian Slovakia. During his stay there, in Hroznová Lhota, he married a local schoolteacher. He had to leave, in 1891, apparently because he was being pursued by creditors and, on his wife's suggestion, moved to Bystřice pod Hostýnem where they lived in a forester's house, courtesy of Baron von Loudon. In 1896, they were able to travel to Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, where he received a commission to copy the frescoes at the Monastery of the Madonna of Lourdes in Verona. ==Teaching career== In 1899, he accepted a teaching position at the newly opened Brno University of Technology, but was not pleased, as the work involved simple technical drawing, rather than art. To make matters worse, his creditors tracked him down again and he was able to avert legal action only by receiving financial assistance from the poet, Josef Svatopluk Machar. Shortly after, he was awarded a commission by the Thonet brothers. He painted six watercolors, depicting life in their factory, which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1900). He also created some popular tapestry designs for the Moravská gobelínová manufaktura. Two years later, he returned to Prague and was named a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. His students there included Otakar Kubín, Václav Rabas, , , Oldřich Blažíček, and František Mořic Nágl. In 1906, he developed a tumor on his tongue. He underwent a successful surgery in the Netherlands but, after a few years, the tumor returned. After several more surgeries, it was decided to remove his tongue entirely, and he died of complications not long after.

Hundreds of protesters took to Elliott Bay in kayaks, rafts, and other small boats, both as a demonstration and to interrupt docking of Shell's Polar Pioneer semi-submersible drilling vessel at Terminal 5. The waterborne demonstrators were dubbed kayaktivists by social and news media. On September 27, 2015 Shell announced that their exploration in the summer of 2015 was \\"disappointing\\" and that they would abandon further oil exploration in the Arctic \\"for the foreseeable future\\". ==Historical background== Satirical sign at Jack Block Park by Seattle artist Jack Daws Activists coordinated on social media with the hashtags #ShellNo and #paddleinseattle Bellingham Seattle has been a staging point for those seeking to exploit the natural resources of the Alaska region since the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, when the city was the main supply center and departure point for prospectors heading to the gold fields of Alaska and the Yukon. The perception by some Alaskans that Seattle exerted undue influence on the Territory helped motivate their desire for Alaskan statehood, achieved in 1958. Since the discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay in 1968, Seattle has played an integral role in the Alaska petroleum industry. The city of Seattle says the maritime sector which includes ship builders, cargo vessels and tug companies comprises 22,000 jobs for a $2.1 billion annual contribution to the Seattle economy. Seattle is known for environmentalism. A theme of the 1999 Seattle WTO protests was the reconciliation of the labor and environmental movements under the slogan \\"Teamsters and Turtles: Together at Last\\", seeking to end the traditional stalemate of job creation pitted against environmental protection in a zero sum conflict. In the summer 2012, Shell refurbished the Kulluk and the Noble Discoverer drillships in Seattle, which the company said employed 400 shipyard workers and put $200 million into the local economy. The ships were for use in exploration for oil in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas off Alaska's North Coast, which if successful could begin production no sooner than 2023. Greenpeace opposed these plans, and some Iñupiat people of the North Slope said that in spite of the economic benefits to them, they feared damage to the ocean environment they depend on for food. A Barrow, Alaska village organization director said, \\"We are opposed to offshore development because the ocean is like our garden up here in the Arctic for our subsistence way of life.\\" The Kulluk ran aground in January 2013 and had to be rescued, resulting in the US Department of the Interior ordering Shell to halt drilling until safety problems were corrected. Shell was criticized in an Interior Department report, which cited inadequate supervision of subcontractors by Shell's management, and a lack of preparedness for the Arctic conditions. New regulations were written by the Department, and drilling was restricted to shallower waters, up to deep, and to summer months only, and stricter rules on blowout preventers were put in place. Environmentalists and oil industry experts agree the area is one of the most dangerous areas in the world to drill, because besides rough seas including waves, storms, and cold weather, the cleanup and rescue is made harder by a lack of any roads to major cities and no deepwater ports within hundreds of miles, with the closest Coast Guard station capable of assisting in an oil spill located away. Bowhead whales and walruses migrate through the area, and the Iñupiat fear an oil spill could damage both their whaling-based culture and livelihood. A statement from the Interior Department said they were taking a \\"thoughtful approach\\" in balancing environmental and safety concerns, and respect for the traditions of indigenous people. Susan Murray of the environmental group Oceana said, \\"Shell has not shown that it is prepared to operate responsibly in the Arctic Ocean, and neither the company nor our government has been willing to fully and fairly evaluate the risks of Shell's proposal.\\" Shell's Alaska vice president Pete Slaiby said its goal was not, \\"any kind of grand energy independence\\", but rather that, \\"This is all about energy choice,\\" so that the US could replace oil imports from hostile foreign regimes with domestic production. Shell says the Arctic holds about 30% of the undiscovered oil and gas in the world, and exploiting it is necessary to satisfy growing world demand, though US domestic petroleum production is booming in 2015, due mainly to fracking in Texas and North Dakota, and oil prices are falling. At current rates the goal of US energy independence, oil exports exceeding imports, could be reached by 2030, according to the US Energy Information Administration. This turning point could come sooner with greatly increased Arctic oil production. ==Prior to public discussion== In October 2013, Terminal 5's tenant, Eagle Maritime Services, made plans to relocate. The Port of Seattle decided to update T5, and they asked businesses, including Foss Maritime, to find temporary uses for that terminal. Foss has been in Seattle for over 100 years. In May, 2014, Foss Maritime representatives met with Port staff, discussing the use of T5 to handle modules of a liquid natural gas plant which would go by barge to Canada for assembly. In June, Foss had the idea of using T5 for mooring Shell oil rigs. The purpose of the new lease was to provide an off-season harbor for Shell vessels conducting exploratory drilling in the summer in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska's northwest coast. The US Geological Survey has estimated the offshore reserves in the Arctic at 26 million barrels of oil and 130 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The leases of Eagle Marine Services and Westwood Shipping Lines ended in July 2014, so the following month Eagle moved to the Port of Seattle's Terminal 18 and Westwood moved to Tacoma, so T5 was without a tenant. The new lease with Shell was valued at $13 million. During these months, representatives of Shell, Foss, The US Coast Guard, the Port, and Puget Sound Pilots watched a simulation of an oil rig entering Elliott Bay to evaluate traffic safety and determine where to moor the rigs. In December 2014, the commissioners and staff of the Port were receiving emails from the maritime community expressing support for hosting the drilling rigs. During the last months of 2014, a safety assessment was carried out by the Port, the Coast Guard, Foss, and Puget Sound Pilots, by conducting a simulation of an oil rig entering Elliott Bay. ==Public announcement and protest== \\"The People's Barge\\", a solar and wind-powered multimedia platform opposing the Polar Pioneer and Arctic drilling On January 13, 2015, the first public meeting took place regarding plans by Foss to host Shell's Arctic drilling fleet at Terminal 5. On February 9, the lease with Shell was signed by Port of Seattle CEO Ted Fick. When the deal became known, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and the Seattle City Council announced they would review it. On March 9, the city of Seattle began looking for ways it could hinder the deal. Murray asked Port to reconsider the contract with Foss, and said that the Port of Seattle must get permits for new uses in order to host the Arctic drilling fleet, explaining that, \\"This is an opportunity for the port and all of us to make a bold statement about how oil companies contribute to climate change, oil spills and other environmental disasters – and reject this short-term lease.\\" US Coast Guard assists in removing a protester from the anchor chain of the barge Arctic Challenger Shell's Polar Pioneer semi-submersible drilling rig arrived in Port Angeles, Washington on April 17, 2015, on its way to Seattle. The Polar Pioneer, , was built in 1985 by Hitachi Zosen Corporation in Ariake, Kagoshima, Japan. The rig is long and wide, with a draft of , and rising to a height of , weighing . It is driven by electric motors powered by diesel generators, at an average speed of , and a maximum of . The Marshall Islands- registered ship is owned and operated by Transocean, and is ander contract to Royal Dutch Shell. On May 11, the Obama administration and the Department of the Interior announced that Shell had won conditional approval to being exploratory drilling in the Chukchi Sea with leases Shell had acquired in 2008. Seven more state and Federal permits would be required to commence operations. The decision was a victory for Shell, having worked for several years to overcome regulatory roadblocks, based primarily on concerns of an accident like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The dangers of the Arctic seas and weather were seen as increasing the risk of an accident, as well as exacerbating the difficulty of containing a blowout and oil spill, and carrying out cleanup. An earlier attempt to begin drilling was suspended due to safety issues including a fire on one rig. On May 12, the same day Port Commissioners filed an appeal of the city's land use permit decision, Shell's drillship Noble Discoverer arrived in Everett, Washington on its way to Bellingham, Washington. The ship, is a Liberian-flagged Sonat Discoverer-class drillship built in 1966 by Namura Shipbuilding and owned by Noble Corporation, weighing , long with a tall drilling derrick capable of drilling in of water to a drilling depth of . It was met by 10 protesters in kayaks, along with a Greenpeace motorboat carrying reporters. The kayakers displayed banners reading \\"ShellNo.org\\" and \\"Arctic drilling = climate chaos\\". The Everett protest was described by one kayaktivist as \\"just a warm up\\" for the upcoming event in Seattle. In the pre-dawn hours of May 14, the Polar Pioneer left Port Angeles with a Coast Guard and tugboat escort. A safety zone was established around the moving rig, and the Coast Guard issued warnings to protesters ahead of time to stay clear. At least 20 kayaks, and members of the Duwamish Tribe in a large wooden canoe, greeted the rig in Elliott Bay, unfurling a banner reading \\"Arctic Drilling = Climate Change.\\" Many of the kayakers were freshly trained that day, in rented boats. When the Polar Pioneer arrived in Elliott Bay, it was met by a flotilla of hundreds more protesters in kayaks and other small boats, voicing their opposition to oil drilling in Arctic waters because of the risk of oil spills, undersea oil well blowouts, damage to wildlife from human activity, and the climate change caused by the use of fossil fuels. There were no problems or arrests during the protest and the Polar Pioneer was safely moored at Terminal 5 at 4:30 pm. A counter-protester at Seacrest Park, recently laid off from the maritime industry, said \\"If these (activists) choose to put me and guys like me out of work for an idea, what are they trying to do?\\" Foss Maritime said to date, 417 people had been employed by the Shell contract, with Shell paying Transocean $593,000 per day to lease the Polar Pioneer, out of some $6 billion the company was going to spend on Alaska oil exploration. Over the life of the two-year lease, Foss will pay $13.17 million to the Port of Seattle. Democratic Alaska State Representative Bob Herron said on the Alaska State House floor, \\"It must be nice to eat cheese and sip wine in Olympia while they talk about the Arctic. But it does remind us of the paternalistic past when the state of Alaska was plundered by people from Washington and other areas ... who covet our resources.\\" Shell said they were committed to drilling in the Arctic one way or another, but City Council member Mike O'Brien told MSNBC's Chris Hayes, \\"All the other major players have pulled out of the Arctic. It's only Shell that's left. And the only two ports they were looking at to host this fleet were Seattle and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. And Dutch Harbor's really a problematic environment because the weather up there is so severe. So we think that if they're not in Seattle then it may be the end of Arctic drilling for the near future.\\" With regard to the economic impact on Seattle and the threat of lost jobs, O'Brien said, \\"There's no doubt that our economy is tied to the fossil fuel industry. We have a lot of work to do if we're going to unwind that and become that kind of sustainable planet that we want to be. ... there's jobs tied to that fossil fuel industry. We have to figure out how we transition away from that. What we can't do today is take a huge step backwards. And drilling in the Arctic and tying Seattle's future to successful drilling in the Arctic is that huge step backwards that undermines what were trying to do.\\" As part of the ongoing series of protests, activists from the group Mosquito Fleet rented a barge from Lakeshore Marine Construction of Kenmore. They anchored it off Seacrest Park, christening it \\"The People's Platform\\", and equipping it with speakers, video equipment, a huge video screen, and solar and wind power supplies. The project was led by Arctic drilling protest organizer John Sellers, who works for a nonprofit called The Other 98% which addresses \\"undue corporate influence\\". The Mosquito Fleet raised $16,400 in donations in 6 days with a YouTube video proposal on Indiegogo to fund the barge rental, at a rate of about $15,000 every two weeks. On May 22, 2015 the protests spread to Bellingham when student activist Chiara D'Angelo chained herself to the anchor chain of the Royal Dutch Shell barge Arctic Challenger for 63 hours. * A reference to the historical Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet ==Shell's arctic drilling fleet== File:Polar Pioneer til kais i Tromsø.jpgThe Shell Polar Pioneer in Norway in 2011 File:Shell Polar Pioneer at Terminal 5 in Seattle.jpgPolar Pioneer at Terminal 5 in 2015 File:Arctic Challenger leaving Port of Bellingham for second round of testing.JPGThe Arctic Challenger blowout containment vessel, in Bellingham in 2012 File:Loading the repaired and modified Containment Dome onto the Arctic Challenger.JPGArctic Challengers containment dome File:Noble Discoverer.jpgThe Noble Discoverer drillship in Seattle in 2012 File:3 Ships.jpgThe Kulluk in Elliott Bay in 2012 File:KullukAground 1jan2013.JPGThe Kulluk after running aground in January 2013 ==See also== * Arctic policy of the United States * Arctic Refuge drilling controversy * Petroleum exploration in the Arctic * Save the Arctic ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * Royal Dutch Shell official website on Arctic drilling * Coalition against Arctic drilling Category:2015 in the environment Category:2015 in Washington (state) Category:2015 protests Category:Environment of Alaska Category:Environmental controversies Category:Environmental protests in the United States Arctic drilling protests Category:2015 in Seattle Category:Protests in Seattle ","title":"Seattle Arctic drilling protests"},{"id":"46816828","text":"Berlandiera monocephala is a North American species of flowering plant in the sunflower family.

Attell was Featherweight Champion for a record eleven years, between 1901 and 1912, and fought Kelly three more times in non-title fights. Kelly's three attempts at the Featherweight Championship were a record at the time for the three-year period, and it placed him squarely in the top five of rated Featherweights for those years.Blady, Ken,The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame,(1988), p.40, Shapolsky Publishers, New York, New York ==Early boxing career== First plying his trade as a newsboy, Kelly started his boxing career in the greater New York area around 1900, fighting largely in clubs in Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Erie, Pennsylvania and northeastern Canada. Fighting prior to 1905, he fought Jockey Brady, Darby Giles, and Kid Gleason twice each. He fought the better known boxer Paddy Lavin three times beating him twice and drawing once. Lavin was a skilled 5' 11\\" Irish welterweight from Buffalo who would beat several outstanding boxers in his class after 1909 including Leo Houck, Unk Russell and ex-welterweight champion Honey Mellody. In forty-two of Kelly's better publicized fights between 1900 and 1907, he lost only six bouts, winning an impressive nine by knockout or technical knockout. ==Prepping for the Featherweight Title== Battling Nelson By 1906, he was sparring regularly with Battling Nelson, a lightweight world champion and training partner, who sang his praises. Nelson once told a reporter prior to Kelly's bout with Tommy O'Toole, \\"He sparred with me two and three times a day when I was doing my training for my bout with Terry McGovern...Kelly is the hardest little hitter I ever bumped up against. He has two good hands and they are ever ready to mix it up with you...\\"Edgren, R., \\"Battling Nelson Practices His Sleep Producer\\", The Evening World, Evening Edition, pg. 12, New York, New York, 7 March 1906.\\"Nelson Picks Kelly to Defeat O'Toole\\", The Evening World, Evening Edition, pg. 8, New York, New York, 22 May 1906. In the spring of 1906, he knocked out competent club fighters Jack Flanigan, Abe Hollandersky, and Barney Abel in one round at the Metropolitan Athletic Club in Manhattan. The New York Evening World wrote in a promo for his next bout with George Hoey, that \\"Kelly is after a bout for the Featherweight Championship with Abe Attell and to demonstrate his worth is meeting the best feathers in this city. His path so far has been a rosy one. In Hoey he tackles a tough proposition, and if he scores decisively his claim to a fight with Attell will be merited.\\" On March 30, 1906, he defeated George Hoey in the third round at the famed Sharkey Athletic Club in Manhattan. Only two years later, the Sharkey A. C. would be the setting for what may be considered America's greatest boxing painting, George Bellows, Stag at Sharkey's.\\"Murphey Winner Over Bert Keyes\\", The Evening World, Evening Edition, pg. 10, Image 9, New York, New York, 26 March 1906. Kid Beebe The Evening World wrote after his match with Kelly, that \\"Hoey is a rugged lad who likes to fight in close, his specialty being swapping punches at close range. The World went on to note that \\"in this style he (Hoey) met his master in Kelly, who would lead with a left jab and then tear in with head down, working both hands like piston rods for his opponent's mid-section.\\" \\"Kelly Won From Geo. Hoey\\", The World, Evening Edition, pg. 6, New York, New York 31 March 1906.\\"Eddie Kelly Meets Geo. Hoey To-night\\", The World, Evening Edition, pg. 18, New York, New York, 30 March 1906. Shortly before his bout with Attell, Kelly had an important win against Kid Beebe on November 22, 1907 which he won on a disqualification. Beebe was a prolific boxer with over 250 career fights. He once beat Jack Britton and fought the great welterweight Leo Houck. Beebe may have had a disadvantage against Kelly due to his short stature. In May and November 1906, Kelly fought Tommy O'Toole, who in September 1909 would also contend for the Featherweight Crown against Attell. ==Three attempts at the Featherweight Championship== Abe Attell, Featherweight Champ In a buildup to the Featherweight Championship, many Kelly fans were optimistic about his chances with Attell, due to his past performance. The Los Angeles Herald wrote, \\"some enthusiastic Kelly men profess to believe that he will enter the ring a favorite over Attell...Kelly is hailed as the successor to Terry McGovern and there is reason for it. He resembles the once terrible one in many ways. He has the same aggressive appearance, is stoutly built on the best of fighting lines and is a tremendous hitter for a boy of his size. He is a featherweight from his chest down, but his arms are almost as heavily muscled as those of a welterweight.\\" But it was not to be.\\"Kelly Men Bet Money\\", Los Angeles Herald, pg. 8, Los Angeles, California, 27 February 1908. The San Francisco Call took note of Attell's strategy in Kelly's first shot at the Featherweight Championship on February 28, 1908 at Dreamland Rink in San Francisco. The Call wrote that \\"from the workmanlike manner in which he (Attell) brought the unequal contest to a close, it was evident that he could have ended it much sooner had he been so inclined.\\" By the seventh round \\"it was evident that he wanted to knock out his opponent then and there if possible.\\" The referee completed a full count shortly after the fight was called a TKO by a Police Captain present at ringside.Smythe, R. A., \\"Challenger for Championship Title Suffers from Stage Fright\\",San Francisco Call, pg. 8, San Francisco, California, 29 February 1908. Kelly made no excuses for his performance and admitted what many already knew when he told one reporter, \\"he was outclassed by Attell\\", and simply lacked the champion's experience.\\"Kelly Says He Lacked Experience to Beat Attell\\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 8, 29 February 1908 Attell in his youth In their second Featherweight title bout, in Washington state on April 20, 1908, Attell finished Kelly in eight rounds, chewing gum during the match. The Seattle Star concluded the following day that Kelly had shown skill and determination and \\"demonstrated an ability to take punishment\\", but in the end, \\"it was a case of science against dogged determination, and science won.\\" \\"Attell is Winner\\",Seattle Star, Last Edition, pg. 2, Seattle, Washington, 21 April 1908. Attell's ability to end his matches in a predetermined number of rounds was so remarkable that it became the stuff of legend. Boxing writer Ken Blady reported that Attell bet $8,000 he would end his first bout with Kelly within eight rounds, and when he won in seven, he gave his winnings to Kelly so he could afford a home for his mother. By 1912, wary of Attell's antics with gambling, the New York State Athletic Commission barred him from boxing in the state for six months. Remarkably, in their third and last Featherweight title match on February 4, 1909 in New Orleans, Attell once again finished the bout in seven rounds.Blady,Ken,The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame,(1988), pgs.40,45, Shapolsky Publishers, New York, New York Kelly was never the same. In his remaining three fights with Attell, he lost in four, five, and six rounds. After his lessons from Attell, Kelly lost bouts with greater frequency but with more challenging opponents before he retired from the ring around 1913. The El Paso Herald noted that Kelly had once fought a draw with future Welterweight Champion Jack Britton, and beaten the noteworthy New York boxer Grover Hayes.\\"Frankie Gage Sick for a Day; Cramps Prevent Him from Training.\\" El Paso Herald, El Paso, Texas, pg. 7, 30 July 1914 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1885 births Category:Year of death missing Category:American male boxers Category:Featherweight boxers Category:Boxers from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from Buffalo, New York ","title":"Eddie Kelly (boxer)"},{"id":"46816903","text":"Roman Ivanovych Meleshko (; born 8 September 1971) is a former Ukrainian football player. ==Honours== ;Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk *USSR Federation Cup winner: 1989 *USSR Federation Cup runner-up: 1990 ;Dinamo Minsk *Belarusian Premier League champion: 1992–93 ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Zaporizhia Category:Soviet footballers Category:Ukrainian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Ukrainian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Belarus Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:Russian Premier League players Category:Ukrainian Premier League players Category:FC Dnipro players Category:FC Metalurh Zaporizhya players Category:FC Baltika Kaliningrad players Category:FC Rechitsa-2014 players Category:FC Dinamo Minsk players Category:FC Spartak Vladikavkaz players Category:FC Slavia Mozyr players Category:FC Fandok Bobruisk players Category:FC Zorya Luhansk players Category:FC Lukhovitsy players ","title":"Roman Meleshko"},{"id":"46816914","text":"Asali Solomon is an American professor, author, and novelist.

This was one of the fastest crossings from Brest to Petite ferme on the La Côte-de-Beaupré with pilot Pellegrin, port captain of Quebec, who was on his forty-second crossing. Captured by the Royal Navy in 1757, she was renamed HMS Aurora and saw active service in the latter half of the Seven Years' War. She was broken up for timber at Plymouth Dockyard in 1763. ==French Navy career 1756–1757== Abénaquise or Abenakise was built in Quebec and launched in 1756.Winfield 2007, p. 200 ==Royal Navy career 1757–1763== In 1757 she was captured by and brought into Portsmouth Harbour as a prize ship. On Admiralty's order she was purchased by the Royal Navy on 8 January 1758, for a sum of £6,103.11s for the hull and £425.4s for the masts and internal fittings. She was renamed HMS Aurora on 22 June, and commissioned into the Royal Navy in October 1758 under Captain Samuel Scott. Her 250-man crew comprised four commissioned officers a captain and three lieutenants overseeing 49 warrant and petty officers, 117 naval ratings, 44 Marines and 36 servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp. 348351 Among these other ranks were five positions reserved for widow's men fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the families of sailors who died at sea. Auroras first Royal Navy duties were as a troop transport, ferrying British soldiers from England to Gibraltar ahead of an expected French or Spanish assault. Thereafter, she was sailed for Havre de Grace, Maryland in search of French privateers. However there were concerns about her seaworthiness and she was returned to England in 1760 to undergo two successive naval surveys. No repairs were carried out, and instead Aurora was paid off in 1761 and her crew dispersed to other ships. The vessel was recommissioned in 1762 under Captain Raby Vane and assigned to coastal patrols and cruising in English home waters and off the coast of France. She was again the subject of a naval survey, in December 1762, and was removed from active service in the same month. At the conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, she was disassembled at Plymouth Dockyard and her timbers sold for £152.5s. ==NotesReferencesBibliography=== * W.J.

The work is based on a play, which in turn is based on the real story of a group of migrants who become trapped in a train car on their way to the United States, with all but one succumbing to suffocation. The orchestration of the work is notable as it is a mix of modern symphony and traditional village band music. For the work’s premiere in the city of Oaxaca, the music was reorchestrated so that it could be played by a real village band, one from the small Oaxacan town of San Bartolomé Zoogocho. Since then, the work has been performed multiple times in Mexico City and Ciudad Juarez, as well as the 2014 Festival Internacional Cervantino. ==Composition== With a title from a Juan Rulfo short story, the work was created by Víctor Rasgado of Oaxaca, his fifth opera. Rasgado is from a prominent Oaxaca musical family, who studied composition at the Escuela Nacional de Música, the Centro de Investigación y Estudios Musicales in México and various schools in Europe. He has received various grants and awards for his work, both in Mexico and abroad. The opera is based on a play by Hugo Salcedo, called El viaje de los cantores. This play is based on a real event in the 1980s, when a group of migrants were abandoned in a broken down train car, with all but one succumbing to suffocation. The survivor was able to breathe through a small hole in the door. It was twenty years before this story was ever staged. ==Story and staging== The opera has eleven scenes in one act, lasting just over an hour. It has nine actors and an austere set. Sung in Spanish, the only survivor in the story becomes the narrator in the work. The work is a social reflection of the phenomenon, including the division of families and the almost complete abandonment of towns because of the lack of jobs. The lead female part represents the wives and mothers left behind after the men travel north. The sound is unconventional for an opera, especially the orchestration, as it is a mixed of traditional Mexican rural band music and more contemporary composition. The work was originally conceived for percussion, saxophone and piano, but it was rearranged for a traditional Oaxaca rural band, becoming to first opera written in Mexico to be accompanied in this manner. ==Performances== The opera had its premiere in 2011 at the Macedonio Alcalá Theater in the city of Oaxaca, as part of the Eduardo Mata Festival.This first performance has a complement of thirty eight musicians, actors and directors. The musical ensemble for this performance was the San Bartolomé Zoogocho town band, chosen because half of the town’s population has migrated to the United States. Since then it has performed at various venues in Mexico City, Ciudad Juárez and in 2014, was included in the 2014 Festival Internacional Cervantino. ==References== Category:2011 operas Category:Operas based on plays Category:Operas Category:Spanish-language operas Category:One-act operas ","title":"Paso del Norte (opera)"},{"id":"46816991","text":"The 2007 Arab Youth Athletics Championships was the second edition of the international athletics competition for under-18 athletes from Arab countries.

He claimed that he was unhappy with his previous school and felt that he would see more immediate success with the Retrievers. One of Johnson's teammates also transferred to the same team with him, making the process smoother in his opinion. ==Professional career== In 2011-2012, Johnson played with the Beltway Bombers in the Atlantic Coast Professional Basketball League (ACPBL). The Bombers won the ACPBL championship and Johnson won the APBL Finals Most Valuable Player award. In 2012-2013, Johnson joined the National Basketball League of Canada's Saint John Mill Rats.

Studies report that physicians are more likely to complete suicide than the general population and even people with similar academic training who are not physicians. The suicide mortality rate (\\"completion\\") is about the same among male and female doctors, and significantly higher than the general population. Female physicians are at higher risk of attempting suicide than men, showing rates over 250% higher among women and about 70% higher among men versus the general population. In the United States of America, an estimated 300 to 400 doctors kill themselves each year, a rate of 28 to 40 per 100,000 or more than double that of general population. ==Medical trainees== A 1999 paper reported that even though there is agreement that being a physician increases a person's risk of suicide, there is little research on the risk of suicide among medical students. A study of medical residents in the United States from 2000-2014 found that suicide was one of the leading causes of death in that population. ===Institutions=== In 2018 a journalist for Refinery29 reviewed how Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan responds to suicide by its physicians. ==Response== Historically, physicians who sought help for suicidal ideation sometimes faced professional punishments including risk of having their medical license revoked, future barriers to career advancement, and restrictions on professional privileges. However, many non-profit organizations and healthcare systems have begun developing tools and resources for physicians and other healthcare professionals to seek help and support as well as to address systemic barriers to treatment. Some professional organizations recommend that health organizations reform policy to allow physicians who want counseling to be able to access it with fewer professional penalties. == In the media == Do No Harm is a documentary film about physician suicide released in 2018. During the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City in 2020, doctor's deaths by suicide gained media attention. The story of Dr. Lorna Breen, an ER doctor at New York Presbyterian-Allen Hospital in Northern Manhattan, helped to gain awareness about this issue of mental health struggles, burnout, and suicide risk amongst doctors working through the crisis. ==References== Category:Suicide by subculture ","title":"Suicide among doctors"},{"id":"46817077","text":"Tosh Samkange (born March 15, 1997) is an American soccer player. ==Career== On February 10, 2015, it was announced that Samkange signed a letter of intent to play college soccer at the University of Denver.

The union's goal was to secure employment, wages, and benefits in the face of increased mechanization, shrinking workforce, and the slowing economic climate of the early 1970s. The strike shut down all 56 West coast ports, and lasted 130 days, the longest strike in the ILWU's history. == Background == The ILWU had lost membership and power in the decade leading up to the strike, under two five-year Mechanization and Modernization contracts that reduced the need for labor and decreased union membership. The old 'break bulk' style of loading and unloading, which required a large number of workers, was dangerous, and expensive for employers, and had become obsolete. Increased imports and exports added incentive for more efficient port operations. The introduction of containerization increased port productivity, and required fewer laborers to load and unload cargo. The Mechanization and Modernization contracts (M&M;), one from 1960 to 1965, and another from 1966 to 1971 respectively, forced lay-offs and took recruitment power away from the local unions at each port and gave it to a committee of top union and PMA officials. Prior to the first agreement, this committee introduced non-union laborers to the ports. This was the first time since 1934 that workers who paid union dues and worked under ILWU jurisdiction were allowed to have full-time employment without being granted membership to or benefits from the union. Only the port of Los Angeles resisted the employment agenda early on with organization, but their efforts were squashed as the cargo ships were diverted to other ports (where other longshoremen who were unaware of the Los Angeles port's struggle unloaded the shipments, which were then delivered by truck to the Los Angeles area). The second M&M; was met with further, much larger-scale opposition by laborers. Steadily through the late 1960s, the hiring process became a matter of rank and file; with a growing number of workers skipping the former usual hiring process and being sent straight to a job. These were, for the most part, crane operators and other skilled labor positions. It was considered honorable among union members to say that they had turned down a job that wasn't a fair hire. == 1971: Strike == When negotiations did not come to agreement at the end of the second M&M; on July 1, 1971, longshoremen walked out of every port on the West coast. This was the first fully organized strike by the union since 1934, and the first time the entire coast was shut down in opposition to union leaders. Including shipments to military personnel in Vietnam. The first phase of the strike lasted until October 4, when President Nixon set up a Taft-Hartley Board of Inquiry. When the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) went on strike for four days, it was decided that Taft-Hartley must be invoked in order to avoid further damage to the economy. Ports reopened and the 80-day 'cooling-off' period lasted from October 6, 1971 to January 17, 1972. The ILWU was still not satisfied with the terms offered by the PMA, so they went on strike for the second time. Because of fear that it would extend the strike by giving the longshoremen work, the PMA stopped shipment of military equipment to Vietnam, prompting Congress to pass arbitration legislation on February 7, 1972. But the following day, before arbitration could take place, the two sides reached an agreement and the strike ended. == Aftermath == While there were still some demands that went unmet after the strike, the longshoremen got most of what they wanted. They received a pay increase (although the Nixon administration cut the wage increase nearly in half because it was disproportionate with \\"the general wage and salary standard.\\"), broadened medical benefits to include dental and prescription medicine for workers and their families, as well as pensions, life insurance, and a lowered retirement age from sixty-nine years old with twenty-five years in the union, to sixty-five years old and twenty-five years in the union. == Media coverage in Washington State == The strike was covered by the Seattle P.I. and the Seattle Times, as well as the ILWU's own publication, the Dispatcher. == References == Category:Labor disputes in the United States Category:1971 labor disputes and strikes Category:Maritime labor disputes in the United States ","title":"ILWU 1971 strike"},{"id":"46817130","text":"Yuri Yuryevich Kokoyev (; born 21 August 1980) is a former Russian football player. ==External links== * Category:1980 births Category:People from Tskhinvali Category:Living people Category:Russian footballers Category:FC Spartak Vladikavkaz players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:FC Zhemchuzhina Sochi players Category:FC Chernomorets Novorossiysk players Category:Association football forwards Category:FC Dynamo Stavropol players Category:FC Spartak-UGP Anapa players ","title":"Yuri Kokoyev"},{"id":"46817151","text":"The 1980 Avis British Open Championships was held at the Wembley Squash Centre and the Wembley Conference Centre in London from 4–13 March 1980.

As a two year old in 1948 he was top of the Free Handicap. Abernant was only once on the stretch and that was in a fantastic race for the National Breeders Produce Stakes at Sandown on July 17th. His main opponent was Star King. The 1948 edition of The Bloodstock Breeders Review provided the following wonderful account written by James Park of the race. \\"Star King had won three races in runaway fashion. He had not been engaged at Ascot... Star King's jockey Sam Wragg after a gallop said \\"Abernant may be a good one, but he will have to hop along\\". I should say there was something more than quiet confidence behind Star King. Each had earned the maximum penalty and were meeting at level weights. When the tapes went up off went Star King. Abernant followed at an interval of perhaps three lengths. The others dribbled out of the gate, so that by the time half a furlong had been covered there were many lengths between Star King and the hindmost member of the party. The uphill course at Sandown is not one on which waiting tactics can be employed successfully. So I was rather surprised when Gordon Richards (Abernant's jockey) pretty well sat on Star King's tail without making any attempt to join issue. The leader was slipping along while still on the bit. Gordon, on Abernant, had what is known as a double handful. It was after covering three furlongs that Gordon set Abernant alight. He soon went past Star King and it looked all over bar the shouting. But drama was to follow. Star King had never even been shown the whip in previous races. It had not been necessary. It electrified him to such an extent he suddenly became jet propelled. By that time Abernant had gained probably a length lead. Quick to sense the situation , out came Gordon's whip. The response was not quite the same. Instead of gaining further ground, Abernant began to edge over to the right. Star King kept a perfectly true line. Up he crept, and 100 yards from the winning post he was still gaining. It was anybody's race as they went past the post, with Star King definitely going the stronger. The judge promptly ruled that Abernant had retained sufficient of his lead to win by the shortest of short heads. (There was no photo finish at Sandown at the time) James Park went on to write I am old enough to know better than to argue with the judge. He is the one person in a position to give an opinion. Sam Wragg thought he had won and he was not the only one. '' Mr Wilfred Harvey, the owner of Star King, took it well. \\"I hope they can meet again over 6 furlongs\\" he said. They did not do so. The controversy raged throughout the season, and no doubt continued during the winter. There was the usual inquest. Noel Murless ... told me that in home gallops Abernant had been ridden from behind, and had always produced a brilliant burst of speed in the last 100 yards or so. That was why it was decided to adopt similar tactics at Sandown.The Bloodstock Breeders Review 1948 In the Free Handicap at the end of the year Abernant was allocated 9st 7lb and Star King was second on the list at 9st 5lb. Timeform, in its first Annual that rated all horses, gave Abernant 133 and Star King 131 rating.

On 14 April 2008 the Prague 8 city district announced its intention to hold a one-round competition, open to the public, for the design of a memorial to Operation Anthropoid and to Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík. One of the chief design requirements for the memorial was that it should not merely commemorate one of the most successful actions of the Czechoslovak resistance during World War II, but that it should also serve as a tribute to the virtues embodied in the Czechoslovak military tradition – a commitment to one's oath of duty, and to defending one’s nation even at the cost of one's own life. Twenty proposals were submitted. On 27 May 2008, the anniversary of the Operation Anthropoid, a proposal was chosen. The authors of the winning proposal were artists David Moješčík and Michal Šmeral, and architects Miroslava Tůmová and Jiří Gulbis. Moješčík and Šmeral had previously collaborated on various projects in connection with \\"public art\\". The memorial was to be located on the actual site of the assassination. Work on the memorial began immediately thereafter. On 27 May 2009 at 10:35 a.m. – the exact time of the assassination – a celebratory unveiling of the completed memorial was held. The figures are manufactured from bronze cast from a clay- modelled statue. The column is made of welded steel enclosed by corten steel. == Inspiration and evolution of design == Overall view The starting point for the design was Leonardo da Vinci's 1490 drawing \\"Vitruvian Man\\"; from which is derived the \\"Vitruvian Cross\\", illustrating the proportions of the human body. The stance of the depicted man as a generalization of the human physique is therefore an allusion to the very name \\"Operation Anthropoid\\", as \\"anthropoid\\" means \\"human in form or appearance\\". Although the memorial's design underwent a constant evolution as the artists worked on it, the \\"Vitruvian Man\\" was the original basis of the figures surmounting the sculpture's central column and remained the memorial's chief design element from its conception to its completion. One of the initial concepts for the memorial involved the use of a stone block to represent the Czech flag. This early conception then went through various iterations, in which the block was first divided into the three geometrical shapes composing the Czech flag, and was then, in a subsequent design, merged with the shape of a \\"Czech hedgehog\\" - an anti-tank obstacle most familiar to English-speakers from its use by the Germans on the beaches of Normandy but invented in Czechoslovakia and used throughout Europe in World War II. The flag motif, though eventually simplified, remained a basic element of the finished composition. It was incorporated into the design of the central column, which, being triangular in cross-section, corresponds to the equilateral triangle in the Czech flag. This simplification was necessitated by the somewhat awkward shape of the memorial site. The central column was clad in corten, a form of weathered steel, symbolizing the destruction of Czech statehood and the subjugation of the entire nation. After being exposed to the weather for several years the corten will form a stable, rust-like appearance. As envisioned in the initial drafts the column is surmounted by three Vitruvian figures, each standing on an edge of the column and facing outward. == Geographic context == Detail The assassination took place in Prague 8, at a hairpin turn created by the junction of (Avenue) and (Avenue). This site was chosen because the hairpin turn required Heydrich's driver to slow down when negotiating this turn, thereby creating a favorable opportunity for an ambush. The actual site of the assassination was the site chosen for the memorial. In the intervening years, the local geography has greatly changed. , now named , no longer intersects . Although there is still a junction in the same place, it is formed by and two access ramps of the surrounding traffic interchange, the three roads together forming a triangular traffic island inside the hairpin turn where formerly intersected . Because the memorial was to be located amidst several busy thoroughfares, its most numerous and frequent observers would be the occupants of passing vehicles; this therefore became a very important factor in determining the proper scale for the memorial. The area surrounding the base of the sculpture has been designed so that the memorial integrates with the existing features of the parterre in a very natural manner. This area now consists of long, narrow concrete slabs, separated by narrow strips of earth, allowing grass to grow between the slabs. The greenery bursting through the concrete slabs not only integrates the memorial into the site, but also emphasises the vital spirit of the memorial and the events it commemorates. There is a memorial plaque directly in front of the sculpture. The whole composition escalates towards the sculpture. The ample space offered by this design enables the site to serve as a dignified gathering place for those wishing to remember the sacrifices made by the participants in Operation Anthropoid, as well as those who may gather for any solemn occasion. Streets immediately to the west of the memorial site are now named after Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, who carried out the ambush, and Josef Valcik, who acted as lookout and died alongside them in Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral. ==ReferencesAdditional sources== * ASSASSINATION Operation ANTHROPOID 1941–1942, Michal Burian, Aleš Knížek, Jiří Rajlich, Eduard Stehlík, Prague 2002 * Web of Author of The Memorial Category:Monuments and memorials in the Czech Republic Category:Operation Anthropoid Category:Prague 8 ","title":"Operation Anthropoid Memorial"},{"id":"46817317","text":"The Honor Rumble is a periodically held battle royal promoted by the U.S.-based professional wrestling promotion Ring of Honor.

This collection was supplemented by exchanges, donations, and purchases. The original catalogues compiled by King still extant. In 1883 Richard J. Anderson was appointed as Chair of Natural History, Geology and Mineralogy, and amalgamated the geology and zoological collections to form a Natural History Museum. At this time the collection was housed in five rooms, three given over to zoology and two for the geological and palaeontological collections. Upon the death of Anderson, the chair was split into that of Natural History, and Geology and Mineralogy. During the tenure of Professor Henry Cronshaw, the Museum was broken up, with only the geological collections remaining in the present location. In 1921, Professor James Mitchell became Chair of Geology and Mineralogy, a position he held until 1966. Under Mitchell's tenure the gallery and collections remained intact. The Museum was named in honour of Professor Mitchell in 1977, in recognition of his work within the college. Over the years the collections have undergone periods of neglect and restoration. The first refurbishment happened in 1975, with the space cleaned and redecorated, and specimens conserved. There had been no new specimens added to the collections from 1879 until 1975. The Museum specimens were conserved again by FAS workers in the 1990s, which included cataloguing the collections into a computer database. ==Contents== View inside the James Mitchell Geology Museum The Museum is now housed in one room, formerly the Geographical Museum. The Museum contains specimens of rocks, minerals and fossils, which primarily serve as an educational resource for the students and staff of NUI Galway, but also primary and secondary school children. There are approximately 5000 fossils and 3000 rocks and minerals within the collections. The collections are of particular interest to the study of Irish geology. Much like the Natural History Museum in Dublin, the gallery is in the Victorian cabinet style, a \\"museum of a museum\\". The collections were intended to be representative of international geology, with examples from all around the world. The palaeontological collections include a plesiosaur from Lyme Regis, a German ichthyosaur, and Kiltorcan Devonian flora from County Kilkenny. More recent acquisitions include the Dave McDougall collection, reflecting the current focus on collecting local specimens. ==References== Category:1852 establishments in Ireland Category:Buildings and structures of NUI Galway Category:Geology museums Category:History of County Galway Category:Local museums in the Republic of Ireland Category:Museums established in 1852 Category:Museums in County Galway ","title":"James Mitchell Geology Museum"},{"id":"46817322","text":"Gray Construction is an American construction contractor based in Lexington, Kentucky.

The United Christian Party (UCP) was a political party first established in the American state of Iowa in August 1897. Although superficially professing an orientation towards theocracy and a conservative social program in its earliest years, the UCP advocated progressive political reform, promoting direct democracy through implementation of initiative and referendum. By 1904 the organization advocated government ownership of key natural resources and public utilities and an opposition to monopolistic forms of economic ownership in accord with the golden rule. The UCP was the brainchild of Rev. William Rudolph Benkert of Davenport, Iowa, who dominated the organization as its National Chairman throughout its entire existence. After running tickets for President and Vice President of the United States under its own name in the elections of 1900, 1904, and 1908, the UCP was briefly absorbed into a new organization called the American Party in 1909 before resuming its former name. In 1912 another very short-lived name change was made, this time to Christian Patriots. This change was again quickly reversed and the party's ticket appeared on the November 1912 ballot under its old moniker. The party continued in existence but went on hiatus, failing to run a presidential ticket in the elections of 1916, 1920, or 1924. While intimations were made that a presidential ticket would be fielded in 1928, it seems that this plan came to naught and the party expired. == Organizational history  Early history === The United Christian Party was the brainchild of Rev. William Rudolph Benkert, a minister at the Church of God in Davenport, Iowa moved to action by what he perceived to be the nation's declining moral values and called for a return to the Christian moral tradition.Darcy Richardson, Others: Third Parties During the Populist Period: Volume II. New York: iUniverse, 2007; pg. 303. In August 1897 an organizational conference was held in Davenport to establish a political organization through which Benkert might advance his political agenda.\\"United Christian Party: A Proposal to Hold a National Convention in the Near Future,\\" Davenport Daily Leader, vol. 8 (April 24, 1898), pg. 4. A subsequent conference helping to solidify the organization was held in the neighboring town of Washington, Iowa, and planning began almost immediately for a national convention to be held in a major Midwestern city. In the spring of 1898 Benkert came out with a draft national platform which acknowledged \\"Almighty God and the rightful sovereign of all men and women, and the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler among the nations of the earth.\\" Having made this tip of the hat to theocracy, Benkert's program declared the United Christian Party to be a \\"party of reform\\" in favor of \\"whatever tends to make men and women intelligent and virtuous.\\" Such reforms were envisioned to be enabled by the establishment of direct legislation through implementation of the system of initiative and referendum and proportional representation. Benkert's draft platform declared: > We believe that it will be impossible to secure direct legislation without a > union of all Christians and all reformers and reform parties, and knowing > that there is no higher standard of reform than Christ and no more worthy > name to be honored in uniting us than his name, and knowing he is a true > friend of those who labor and a friend of the poor and oppressed and that > God hears us when we ask for reform in His name, therefore we ask all his > followers, regardness of nationality, creed or color, sex or previous > politics to join hands with us in His name at the ballot box in making this > a government by and for the people through direct legislation of the people > ... === 1899 Iowa State Convention === The Inn at Black Hawk's Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois, was the frequent location of conventions of the United Christian Party. On July 4, 1899, delegates gathered in Des Moines, Iowa for what was touted as the first annual Iowa State Convention of the United Christian Party.\\"End of the Convention: State Meeting of United Christian Party Adjourns, First Annual Session,\\" Daily Iowa Capital [Des Moines], vol. 16, no. 162, Third Edition (July 5, 1899), pg. 3. The gathering received an official communication from the National Reform Party which requested that the convention name a 10-member delegation to attend a joint convention held at some future time to be determined in the following year to name a ticket for a national campaign in the November 1900 election. Individuals were selected to comprise a State Central Committee to govern the affairs of the United Christian Party in Iowa, one from each of five congressional districts, with no committee members immediately named for the three other congressional districts in the state. Nominees were selected to represent the party in the 1899 Iowa elections, topped by C. C. Heacock of Brighton for Governor and Rev. John Fitz Randolph Leonard of Ainsworth for Lieutenant-Governor, in addition to nominees for other state offices. A short platform, borrowing heavily from William R. Benkert's previous draft document, was approved. The choice of Heacock for Governor was regarded by peculiar by at least one Des Moines political analyst. Heacock, the publisher of the Brighton Enterprise, was at the time serving a six-month jail sentence following conviction for criminal libel.\\"Editorial,\\" Daily Iowa Capital [Des Moines], vol. 16, no. 165 (July 8, 2015), pg. 4. Moreover, \\"it is not claimed that he is a Christian or even a church member,\\" the editor of the Des Moines Iowa Daily Capital scolded. The UCP subsequent regarded the July 4, 1899 date of the convocation of this convention as its moment of foundation, despite the group's previous organizational history.\\"Meet in St. Louis May 1: Christian Party Will Name Candidate for President,\\" The Pioneer [Bemidji, MN], vol. 1, no. 207 (Dec. 22, 1903), pg. 3. The slate of the United Christian Party of Iowa appeared on the November 1899 state ballot by virtue of a nominating petition campaign which garnered 961 signatures — enough to meet statutory requirements.\\"Ticket is Filed: Secretary Dobson Accepts United Christian Party Filings,\\" Iowa Daily Capital [Des Moines] vol. 16, no. 238 (Oct. 2, 1899), pg. 2. === 1900 National Convention === Rev. Daniel Braxton Turney, 1908 and 1912 candidate of the United Christian Party for President of the United States. The UCP held a national convention from May 1 to 2, 1900 in Rock Island, Illinois. About 25 delegates were in attendance.\\"National Nominating Conventions in 1900: United Christian Party,\\" in George E. Plumbe, The Daily News Almanac and Political Register for 1901. Chicago: Chicago Daily News Co., 1901; pp. 92-93. After unanimously approving a resolution to organize a national \\"Christian political union or party for the application of the Christ principle in state and nation.\\" A second motion to name the organization United Christian Party so as \\"to conform to the development of the movement in Iowa\\" was approved by a vote of 20 to 5, with the names Christian Political Union and Christian Union Party drawing minority support. The convention approved a platform of a socially conservative bent, declaring: > We deprecate certain immoral laws which have grown out of the failure of our > nation to recognize [the principle that no law should contravene the Divine > law], notably such as require the desecration of the Christian Sabbath, > authorize unscriptural marriage and divorce, and license the manufacture and > sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage. The party further called for a ban on the sale of \\"cigarettes or tobacco in any form\\" to minors and for daily reading of the Bible in public schools. Beyond this conservative agenda, the party declared in its 1900 platform in favor of certain items commonly associated with progressivism, including proportional representation and the system of initiative and referendum, an end to mob violence, and termination of war in favor of mediation of all international disputes. The UCP also expressed support for public ownership of utilities as well as for direct election of the President and Vice President of the United States. Rev. Silas C. Swallow of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was unanimously nominated by the conventionfor President of the United States. Swallow later declined the nomination, however, and party stalwart J.F.R. Leonard was ultimately tapped as the party's presidential nominee in his stead. John G. Woolley of Illinois was unanimously chosen as the new party's nominee for Vice President, but he, too, later declined the nomination, to be replaced by Rev. C. M. Sheldon, who also later declined. David H. Martin of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania finally assented, becoming the second name listed on the party's November ticket.\\"National Party Platforms: The United Christian,\\" in Thomas B. Cochran with Herman P. Miller, Smull's Legislative Hand Book and Manual of the State of Pennsylvania, 1901. Harrisburg, PA: William Stanley Ray, State Printer of Pennsylviania, 1901; pg. 565. The Leonard-Martin ticket collected a grand total of 1,059 votes out of approximately 14 million cast in the November 1900 general election.\\"Few Presidents Had More Than One Christian Name,\\" York Daily [York, PA]. Nov. 15, 1912, pg. 4. === 1904 National Convention === The United Christian Party began touting the notion that \\"Christ's golden rule should be applied to all government by and for the people\\" in its convention call for its May 1904 National Convention, and made use of similar slogans in subsequent campaigns. William Benkert remained as the organization's National Chairman and D.H. Martin of Pittsburgh as Secretary.\\"United Christian Party National Committee,\\" The World Almanac and Encyclopedia, 1905. New York: Press Publishing Co., 1904; pg. 100. The UCP's 1904 platform included planks in favor of direct legislation; opposing war and mob violence; favoring government ownership of oil wells, coal mines, and public utilities; opposing government profiting from the liquor trade via taxation of alcoholic beverages; and opposing \\"all trusts and combines contrary to the welfare of the common people.\\"\\"Platform of the United Christian Party, Adopted at St. Louis, Mo., May 2, 1904,\\" The World Almanac and Encyclopedia, 1905. New York: Press Publishing Co., 1904; pg. 109. === 1908 National Convention === In 1908 the United Christian Party nominated Rev. Daniel Braxton Turney of Illinois for President and Lorenzo Coffin of Iowa for Vice President.\\"National Nominating Conventions in 1908,\\" in James Langland (ed.), Daily News Almanac for 1909. Chicago: Chicago Daily News Co., 1908; pg. 193. William R. Benkert remained in place as National Chairman of the organization. The ticket polled about 12,000 in the November 1908 election.\\"Vice Presidential Nominee of United Christian Party,\\" Indianapolis Star, vol. 9, no. 342 (May 12, 1912), pg. 23. === 1909 National Convention === Katherine M. Benkert, wife of UCP National Chairman William Benkert, was Secretary of the party in 1909. National Chairman William Rudolph Benkert issued a call for a \\"national convention\\" to be held May 1, 1909 at the Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois.\\"National Convention Called,\\" Adams County Free Press [Corning, IA], vol. 26, no. 14 (April 10, 1909), pg. 2. This gathering was to be held \\"to confer with one another concerning the will and kingdom of God in earth, in behalf of humanity, as the assembly led by His Spirit, and governed by His command of love, may we see and act upon.\\" The convention seems to have increased the organization's association with the personality of its founder, granting to William R. Benkert the right to personally appoint the members of the party's governing 7-member National Executive Committee.\\"New Honor for Mr. Turney: Decatur Man on National Executive Committee for Christian Party,\\" Decatur Herald, vol. 28, no. 226 (May 5, 1909), pg. 10. The party reconfirmed its dedication to move forward, naming four national organizers to establish state organizations in preparation for the 1912 Presidential campaign, still three years away. For a time it seemed that the plan for organizational advance was not to take place under the United Christian Party moniker, however, as shortly after the 1909 convention was closed it was announced that the UCP had been absorbed by a new organization called the American Party.\\"It Was 10 Cents Instead of $10: Daniel Braxton Turney Modestly Corrects Error in Good Samaritan Story,\\" Decatur Herald vol. 28, no. 209 (July 17, 1909), pg. 11. This name change proved short-lived, however, and the old organizational name was resumed. === 1911 National Convention === The United Christian Party returned on May 1, 1911, to the perennial location for its conventions, the inn at Black hawk's Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois.\\"United Christian Party Convention,\\" in George Edward Plumbe and James Langland (eds.), Chicago Daily News Almanac and Year- Book for 1912. Chicago: Chicago Daily News Co., 1911; pg. 263. The convention predictably reconfirmed party founder William Benkert as National Chairman. In a less predictable move, the convention anticipated modern American electoral politics by nominating young minister Daniel Braxton Turney to head the UCP ticket for a second time in the campaign for president at the November 1912 election — still more than 18 months away. Samuel C. Carter of Howard Lake, Minnesota was selected as Turney's 1912 Vice Presidential running mate. In addition to its perennial calls for obedience to God and the golden rule, the platform adopted at the 1911 National Convention included calls for \\"a rightful ground and income tax\\" and an end to \\"unsettling of business by unjust tariff legislation.\\" \\"We disapprove of a standing army and the expense of further preparation for war,\\" the platform noted. The convention again yielded plenipotentiary authority to its longtime National Chairman, granting to Benkert the power to unilaterally select State Chairmen in each state. === 1912 National Convention === William Benkert's call for a May 1, 1912 National Convention of the UCP was issued in February of that year and indicated that the group sought to \\"end war and capital punishment, and to settle tariff, liquor, trust, and high cost of living questions by direct vote of the people and by the Golden Rule.\\"\\"Odd Bits of Daily News,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, vol. 72A, no. 53, 4 O'clock Edition (Feb. 23, 1912), pg. 26. The Presidential ticket of Daniel B. Turney and Samuel G Carter named by the 1911 convention was unanimously reaffirmed by the gathering.\\"Daniel B. is the Unanimous Choice: Decatur Man Chosen to Lead Christian Patriots,\\" Daily Review [Decatur, IL], vol. 34, no. 122 (May 1, 1912), pg. 1. The United Christian Party name was to be once again terminated, however, with a new name of \\"Christian Patriots\\" selected for the UCP. This change appears once again to have been rapidly abandoned in favor of the established party name.\\"Turney Not on Ticket in His Home State; United Christian Party Candidate Gets Dates Mixed,\\" Decatur Herald, vol. 32, no. 6 (Oct. 10, 1912), pg. 6. In a post-convention statement to the press, Presidential nominee Daniel Braxton Turney indicated that some 250 delegates, representing 7 states, had been in attendance at the 1912 Rock Island gathering.\\"Strenuous Time at Party Convention: Candidate Turney Worn Out by Strain,\\" Daily Review [Decatur, IL], vol. 34, no. 128 (May 7, 1912), pg. 6. He declared, with evident hyperbole, that the party was \\"at least 5,000 percent stronger\\" than it had been during the 1908 campaign. The UCP ticket appeared on the ballot in about 20 states in 1912. === Final years === The United Christian Party remained in existence at least through 1916, holding its annual May Day gatherings in Davenport, Iowa.\\"United Christian Party to Meet: D.B. Turney Not Yet Certain of Presidency,\\" Decatur Review, vol. 38, no. 99 (April 6, 1915), pg. 4. By decision of the small gatherings, the last of which was held in the home of National Chairman William R. Benkert, no ticket was put in the field for the 1916 campaign.\\"United Christians Not in Field: Party Decides Not to Have Presidential Candidate This Year,\\" Daily Review [Decatur, IL], vol. 38, no. 125 (May 4, 1916), pg. 9. The hiatus proved to be an extended one, with no ticket being put forward in the campaigns of 1920 or 1924. In 1927 the tenacious National Chairman William R. Benkert announced plans for a conference to name a candidate for the 1928 campaign, with Judge W.S. Kenyon of Iowa Benkert's personal choice for the nomination.\\"Kenyon is United Christian Choice, Reports Benkert,\\" Davenport Democrat and Leader, vol. 72, no. 162 (April 17, 1927), pg. 15. == Conventions == {  border=\\"1\\" ffffff\\" - ! width=20% ConventionThe United Christian Party used the terms \\"Convention\\" and \\"Conference\\" interchangeably.

In the early 1860s the area was in the midst of a gold rush. From July to August 1863 the gold fields suffered from a combination of floods, snowstorms, and blizzards that caused heavy loss of life among the gold miners. At least 40 died during the July rains and more than 11 in the August snows. Sources using the earliest reports of loss of life tend to greatly overstate the numbers who died. Gabriel's Gully during the height of the gold rush in 1862. ==July weather== The weather up to mid June had been reasonably mild. By late June the winter snows had arrived, but were no more than were normal. Into July there was still no significant change from the routine weather patterns with snow building up in the higher country, although to a lesser extent than normal. ===Heavy rains=== Clutha River On 4 July the weather changed to a six-day period of rain. On 7 July the temperature markedly increased which caused a rapid snow melt. All the rivers in the area; the Clutha (Molyneux), the Kawarau, the Shotover, the Arrow, the Manuherikia, the Bannockburn, and numerous streams flooded. The Clutha River rose in a night. The Shotover River reached above its normal flow and the Arrow River flooded Arrowtown. Even Lake Wakatipu rose over . The gold miners in these areas tended to camp near the river banks and with the sudden change in river flows many were caught unawares and swept to their deaths. Those who escaped the torrents lost all their possessions. The number who lost their lives was unknown. One man was reported drowned on the Arrow River. ===The snows return=== In mid July the snows returned with heavy falls in the high country areas. Roads were blocked and areas isolated. The rains returned by late July, causing more extensive flooding and some loss of life. Five people were killed in a landslip at Moke Creek, one boy was drowned in the Clutha, seven were swept away and drowned in the Shotover, ten killed in a landslip at Sandhills, and three on the Arrow. Overall the flooding was reported as being worse than the early July event with Lake Wakatipu rising . The body of John Donoughue was found on the Crown Range on 21 August. He was thought to have died from exposure on 29 July. On 31 October a further body was found at Frankton on 31 October, which could have been Charles Matthews who drowned on 22 July. ==August blizzards== From 13 to 15 August blizzards and heavy snows swept through inland Otago from the Taieri Plains to the lakes. On 14 August about 40 miners were said to have been buried in an avalanche at Separation Creek in the Serpentine Gully. The party that went to investigate found them alive, but in want of provisions. All areas were isolated as the roads had become impassible and impossible to find. Reports began to come in of various people perishing. In the vicinity of Black Ball and Drunken Woman's Creek a party of 16 were thought to have perished, but this too later proved inaccurate. Another two miners were thought to have perished at the Nevis. Confirmed reports of deaths were a man missing between German Jock's Gully and Teviot, Robert Henry from the Pomahaka diggings on 15 August, and another man Alexander Alexander by an avalanche at Pomahaka. John Penfold from Old Man Range was confirmed dead from exposure on either 12 or 13 August. William Nicol died on his way from Gorge Ferry to Campbells Diggings. There was a further death reported of a man who had been hospitalised suffering from frostbite. The remainder of August had reasonably mild weather. There was one body discovered in September near Pyramid Rock on the Old Man Range when the snow had begun to melt. Two further bodies were found on the Old Man Range in early October, Joseph Thompson who was thought to have died in September and a man called Landregan who was thought to have died in the August blizzards. Nicholas Cordts' body was found at the end of October in Potters Gulley and John Stewart's at the beginning of November in Pomahawka Creek. Both had died during the August blizzards. A skeleton was found in January 1864 near the Timber Gully to Teviot track and the person's cause of death was attributed to being most likely the August blizzard. ==Later fatalities in 1863== The weather through September was a mix of fine spells, rain, and occasional snow. On 23 September, a police party was caught in a heavy snow storm in the Kakanui Range near Naseby. Sergeant Garvie of Ranfurly became separated from the party and died, but the rest reached safety. In December a small party of miners got caught on the summit of the Old Man Range in a storm. Three of the five perished. A similar occurrence took place on Switzer's with one being overcome from exposure and another drowning in a party of five. ==FatalitiesJuly=== The reported fatalities from the July rains were 40 in total: :* 8 July - 1 drowning on the Shotover :* 12 July - 6 killed at Moke Creek :* 12 July - 2 killed at Skippers Gully :* 26 July - 11 killed near Moke Creek :* 26 July - 12 killed at Sandhills :* 26 July - 1 drowned at Manuherikia :* 28 July - 1 died of exposure on Crown Range :* 29 July - 5 killed on the Arrow :* 31 July - 1 killed at Moonlight River ===August=== The reported deaths from the blizzards and snows were 11 confirmed or attributed and 2 suspected. There a number of reports that greatly exaggerated the suspected death toll in the period leading up to the diggings becoming accessible again. There were possibly some deaths that were not reported or bodies that were not found, but these would have been relatively few in number. ==Memorial== In 1928 a stone monument was erected by the Government at Gorge Creek (formerly known as Chamounix Creek) to mark the miners' deaths on the Old Man Range crossing. This location was once the centre of the mining area with stores, hotels, and grog shanties. There are graves in the area of men who died in the storms and the summit of the Old Man Range cairns mark the miners' graves and rescuers who died there. ==See also== * ==References== 1863 Blizzard and flood 1863 Blizzard and flood Category:1863 in New Zealand Category:Otago Gold Rush Category:1863 natural disasters Category:July 1863 events Category:August 1863 events ","title":"Blizzard and flood of 1863"},{"id":"46817721","text":"The 1997 South Pacific Mini Games were held at Pago Pago in American Samoa from 11–22 August 1997.

He combined elements of traditional Byzantine architecture and Romanian architecture with French Art Nouveau in an eclectic style. He served as the chief architect for the Ministry of Public Education and Religious Affairs and the president of the Romanian Society of Architects. He helped found both the latter organization and the Romanian National School of Architecture. Some of his most renowned buildings are the Communal Palace of Buzău, the Noblesse Palace and the Post and Telegraph Palace, which now houses the National Museum of Romanian History. ==Biography== Săvulescu was born in 1847 in Mehedinți County, in what was then Wallachia. He studied in Bucharest and Paris, returned to Romania in 1874 and became the architect for the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs. In this capacity he designed several buildings for middle schools and high schools. He left the post in June 1899, succeeded by Ion D. Berindey. His style was a unique blend of traditional Byzantine architecture and Romanian architecture mixed with French Art Nouveau, which is generically called eclectic. One of the first buildings he created, shortly after his return from training in Paris, was the Noblesse Palace, built in 1881, in the Jewish Quarter. Another 1881 building is located at 7 Sfinților Street, and is considered a historic monument by the Culture Ministry. Ioan Pascu requested a permit for Săvulescu to build on his lot No. 75, which was actually No. 7. The plans were signed by Săvulescu, who built it in an eclectic style with classical elements, featuring a central hallway with symmetrical rooms laid out on either side. The bedrooms, located off a T-shaped corridor, opened into a garden. In Brăila, the Nicolae Bălcescu High School was built by Săvulescu between 1885 and 1886 in the neoclassical style. It is located at 182 Alexandru Ioan Cuza Boulevard. This was followed by a contract signing in March 1890 for construction of the Traian High School in Turnu Severin using Săvulescu's plans. Construction was completed in August 1890. After Dimitrie Maimarolu won an international architecture competition for the Synodal Palace, a group of 24 prominent architects gathered in February 1891 and formed the Romanian Society of Architects (SAR). Maimarolu and Săvulescu, , Ion Mincu, Alexandru Orăscu, and , among others, founded the organization and elected Alexandru Orăscu as its first president. In October 1892, the group set up a private school of architecture. Between 1895 and 1902, Săvulescu served as president of the SAR and during his tenure, in 1897, the private school became the state-funded Romanian National School of Architecture, which today is the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism in Bucharest. Among Săvulescu's best known works is the Post and Telegraph Palace in Bucharest, built between 1894–1900. In 1892, the building was authorized, and Săvulescu was sent with the postal inspector, Ernest Sturza, to tour various postal facilities of Europe for the design. The final sketches were influenced primarily by the building in Geneva. Built in an eclectic style, it is rectangular with a large porch on a high basement and three upper floors. The stone façade features a portico supported by ten Doric columns and a platform consisting of twelve steps spanning the length of the building. There are many allegorical sculptural decorative details. Since 1972, the building has housed the National Museum of Romanian History, and it too been designated a historic monument. Câmpulung features the bust of Muscel Regiment battalion commander Dimitrie Giurescu, a hero of the Romanian War of Independence of 1877, who died in action that November. Săvulescu and sculptor built the monument in 1897, upon the initiative of Colonel Scarlat Geanolu. It is located in the courtyard of a former infantry barracks. The bust is mounted on a solid, high pedestal to which are affixed two plates of black marble. In 1897, the Ștefan cel Mare School in Alexandria moved from its former location to 310 Libertății Street. A local entrepreneur, M. Frangulea, obtained the plot and hired Săvulescu to build the new boys' primary school for the city. The following year, work began on the Amzei Church of Bucharest, completed in 1901. Săvulescu designed the church, and his project team included his friend and fellow architect Ziegfried Kofszynski, engineer Dimitrie Dobrescu and the painter Umberto Marchetti, who supervised the interior decorations. Săvulescu's last creation was the Communal Palace of Buzău, the landmark building of Buzău. Construction lasted from 1899 to 1903 on the Italian Renaissance style town hall, which features towers and loggia-style balconies. It represents some of his most elaborate work, blending styles in an art nouveau arrangement with motifs which appear on other local buildings. The vineyard and grape vines which decorate the column capitals are representative of the importance of grapes to the local economy. The columns are made of Cararra marble and the inscription, \\"Communal Palace\\", was carved by Ploiești sculptor Themistocle Vidali. Săvulescu would not live to see its inauguration in 1903 by King Carol I and Crown Prince Ferdinand, as he died in 1902. Kofszynski completed the project. The palace has been declared an architectural monument. ==Photo gallery== Biserica Amzei.jpgAmzei Church Palatul Poștelor.jpgPost and Telegraph Palace Palatul Postelor (Muzeul National de Istorie al Romaniei).JPGPost and Telegraph Palace/National Museum of Romanian History RO BZ Palat Comunal frontal straight cloudy.jpgCommunal Palace of Buzău ==References== Category:1847 births Category:1902 deaths Category:Romanian architects Category:People from Mehedinți County ","title":"Alexandru Săvulescu (architect)"},{"id":"46817874","text":"Equilibrium partitioning Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) are a type of Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) derived by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the protection of benthic organisms. ESBs are based on the bioavailable concentration of contaminants in sediments rather than the dry- weight concentration. It has been demonstrated that sediment concentrations on a dry-weight basis often do not predict biological effects.United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 2003. \\"Technical basis for the derivation of equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks (ESBs) for the protection of benthic organisms: Nonionic organics.\\" EPA-600-R-02-014. Office of Research and Development. Washington, DC. (draft) Interstitial water concentrations, however, predict biological effects much better. This is true because the chemical present in the interstitial water (or pore water) is the uncomplexed/free phase of the chemical that is bioavailable and toxic to benthic organisms. Other phases of the chemical are bound to sediment particles like organic carbon (OC) or acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and are not bioavailable. Thus the interstitial water concentration is important to consider for effects to benthic organisms. Equilibrium partitioning (EqP) predicts the bioavailable concentration of a chemical under given sediment conditions by using partition coefficients. The bioavailable concentration in interstitial water can then be compared to an established water-based effect concentration and used to predict the likelihood of adverse effects. When a chemical exceeds the ESB, an adverse biological effect may occur, and when concentrations are below or equal to an ESB, biological effects are unlikely to occur. The EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) has published ESBs for approximately 65 pollutants or classes of pollutants including 34 PAHs,EPA. 2003. \\"Procedures for the derivation of equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks (ESBs) for the protection of benthic organisms: PAH mixtures.\\" EPA 600/R-02/013.

Technical Report. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC. == Theory == Equilibrium partitioning theory (EqP) forms the basis for ESBs developed to account for bioavailability of contaminants in sediments. The concentration of interstitial water reflects the chemical's activity and is a surrogate for bioavailability.Di Toro DM, Zarba CS, Hansen DJ, Berry WJ, Swartz RC, Cowan CE, Pavlou SP, Allen HE, Thomas NA, Paquin PR. 1991. \\"Technical basis for the equilibrium partitioning method for establishing sediment quality criteria.\\" Environ Toxicol Chem 11:1541–1583. EqP theory holds that a non-ionic chemical in sediment partitions between sediment OC, interstitial water and benthic organisms. For cationic metals, the chemical also partitions onto sediment AVS, as well as sedimentary OC. At equilibrium, if the partition coefficients are known along with the concentration in any one of the phases, then the concentrations of the other phases can be predicted. Using EqP theory, the bioavailable concentration of chemicals is predicted and then related to an established toxic effect concentration such as the final chronic value (FCV), which is used to derive water quality criteria (WQC) in the US.Stephan CE, Mount DI, Hansen DJ, Gentile GH, Chapman GA, Brungs WA. 1985. \\"Guidelines for deriving numerical national water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic organisms and their uses.\\" PB85–227049. Technical Report. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA, USA. Other values besides the FCV may also be used when an FCV is not available. Using water-based effects concentration when predicting toxic effects in benthos has been supported by studies showing similar effects occur in pelagic and benthic organisms. === Nonionic organic chemicals === Experiments have demonstrated that toxicological effects of benthic organisms are not only correlated to interstitial water concentrations, but also to sediment concentrations when expressed on a microgram chemical/gram OC basis. This is because hydrophobic chemicals like PAHs tend to be bound to OC in sediment. The OC-normalized concentration of sediment concentrations is easily calculated by measuring total OC in sediments synoptically with dry weight concentrations. Thus, the freely dissolved interstitial water concentration of nonionic organic chemicals can be predicted using the KOC, the organic carbon- water partition coefficient, which is a constant for each chemical: KOC = COC/Cd For nonionic organic contaminants, the KOC can be determined based on the octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW). COC is the organic carbon normalized sediment concentration (micrograms per kilogram OC) and Cd is the dissolved interstitial water concentration (milligrams per liter). The equation above can be rearranged to: COC = KOCCd. Using 1/1000 to convert COC in kilograms OC to grams OC and substituting a known water effects concentrations (e.g. FCV), the ESB (micrograms per gram OC) is calculated as: ESB = KOCFCV(1/1000) The calculated ESB is site-specific. === Cationic metals === The equation for the bioavailable concentration for cationic metals including cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, silver and zinc that incorporates the AVS phase is as follows: Cd = (SEM-AVS) / (ƒOCKOC) SEM = simultaneously extract metals == Government Agency Use  Environmental Protection Agency === The EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) has published ESBs for approximately 65 pollutants or classes of pollutants. Five documents describing the derivation of 34 PAHs, nonionic organics,EPA. 2012. \\"Equilibrium Partitioning Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) for the Protection of Benthic Organisms: Procedures for the Determination of the Freely Dissolved Interstitial Water Concentrations of Nonionic Organics.\\" EPA 600/R-02/012.

(2012, July 21). \\"Technical Resources-Guidelines. Water: Contaminated Sediments.\\" Retrieved May 29, 2015, from http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/guidelines.cfm EPA recommends using the ESB approach for the above-mentioned classes of chemicals as well as other nonionic chemicals with hydrophobic chemicals with logKOW > 2.00 and sediments containing TOC ≥ 0.2% dry weight (ƒOC = 0.002). EPA provides technical guidance for their use, however there are no legally binding requirements. == Application == The purpose of SQGs are to provide a relatively inexpensive line of evidence (a chemical concentration) to predict adverse toxicological effects. Ideally they are used in conjunction with biological and toxicity assessments to provide an overall estimation of risk from contaminated sediments. ESBs have been applied to Manufactured Gas Plant Sites where PAHs are a chemical of concern. The ESB approach is based on the additivity of ESBs for the 34 PAHs. Because many historical studies and current studies do not analyze for 34 PAHs, uncertainty factors are employed to calculated ESB for total 34 PAHs. However, it is recommended that all 34 PAHs be analyzed for best results. The site-specific ESB can then be used to determine which sediments should be remediated, and if further toxicity testing should be employed. As mentioned before, it is best to use ESBs as one line of evidence in conjunction with other studies. == Comparison to other SQGs == ESBs are just one of multiple SQGs that have been developed for assessment of contaminated sediments. ESBs are different from other SQGs because they are mechanistically derived using chemical and physical properties. Other SQGs have been derived empirically using databases of synoptically collected sediment chemistry and biological effects. Other SQGs include the apparent effects threshold (AET),Barrick R, Becker S, Brown L, Beller H, Pastorok R. 1988.

Bioaccumulative chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury often affect upper trophic level organisms more seriously than benthic organisms. ESBs, however, are specifically designed for the protection of benthic organisms. As a consequence, the broader ecological risks of bioaccumulative chemicals are not accounted for in the ESB approach. A second limitation is that the ESB approach assumes that nonionic organic contaminants are associated with the organic carbon portion of the sediment. Recent studies have shown that some organic contaminants are associated with another form of carbon called \\"black carbon\\".Gustafsson O, Haghseta F, Chan C, MacFarlane J, Gschwend PM. 1997. \\"Quantification of the dilute sedimentary soot phase: Implications for PAH speciation and bioavailability.\\" Environ Sci Technol 31:203–209. If black carbon constitutes a large fraction of sediment and is not accounted for because only TOC measurements are in the ESB calculation, then ESBs may be overprotective. A final limitations is that ESBs do not always consider the antagonistic, additive or synergistic effects of sediment contaminants. For the specific cases of metal mixtures and individual PAHs, ESBs do take into account additive effects. ==References== Category:Aquatic ecology Category:Water pollution ","title":"Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark"},{"id":"46817877","text":"Nicholas Anderson (October 22, 1856 - December 5, 1919) was an American businessman, farmer, and politician.

Whitley's original version on Dunhil is very rare and much sought after with the Northern Soul Scene. ==References== Category:1965 singles Category:1965 songs Category:ABC Records singles Category:Songs written by Ray Whitley (songwriter) Category:Northern soul songs ","title":"I've Been Hurt"},{"id":"46817956","text":"Zhao Xintong (born 3 April 1997) is a Chinese professional snooker player, widely considered one of the most promising upcoming snooker talents. ==Career== Zhao Xintong first drew international attention in June 2012 at the Zhangjiagang Open defeating high ranking players Xiao Guodong and Yu Delu to reach the last 16 of the tournament where he narrowly lost 4–3 to Stephen Lee. Zhao would build on this success by reaching the second round of Asian Tour Events the Yixing Open and Zhengzhou Open. As a wildcard entrant he defeated former World Champion Ken Doherty in the International Championship to reach the last 32 of a ranking event for the first time, again narrowly losing in a final frame decider 6–5 to Matthew Stevens. Having also earned he way to the last 32 of the World Open and China Open, Zhao started gaining the reputation of the Wildcard Menace. In 2013, at the International Championship, he beat six-time World Champion Steve Davis 6–1 who later commented: \\"This boy was astonishingly good and better than anybody I have ever seen at that age - and that includes Ronnie O'Sullivan.\\" He went on to reach the third round of the competition before losing 6–2 to Marco Fu, however he would go on to avenge this loss by defeating Fu in the first round of the 2014 Shanghai Masters.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/snooker/29048967 Zhao entered the World Amateur Championship in late 2013 reaching the final, however he lost to his fellow countryman Zhou Yuelong 8–4 and thus missed out on a chance to join the world snooker main tour for the 2014–15 season. ===2014/2015 season=== Zhao entered several events in an attempt to qualify for the 2015/2016 season. He was narrowly defeated in the first round of the ACBS Asian Snooker Championship. Xintong won three games in the first event of Q School before losing 4–3 to Alexander Ursenbacher in the penultimate round. In the second event Zhao got extremely close to qualifying for the main tour managing to reach the final round before losing before losing 4–3 to Duane Jones in a black ball finish in the deciding frame. ===2015/2016 season=== Zhao's high Q School Order of Merit ranking gave him entry as a top up player to many events in the 2015–16 season. He whitewashed Stuart Carrington 6–0 to qualify for the International Championship and, despite losing 6–2 to John Higgins in the first round, his effort of 142 won the high break prize for the event. Zhao made his first appearance at the UK Championship, German Masters and Welsh Open, but was knocked out in the opening round of each. He lost in the final of the 2015 IBSF World Snooker Championship 8–6 to Pankaj Advani. It meant that Zhao won a two-year card for the main tour after Advani declined the invitation. ===2016/2017 season=== 2016 Paul Hunter Classic After whitewashing Wang Yuchen 4–0 at the English Open, Zhao met Ronnie O'Sullivan in the second round. Breaks of 130, 107 and 80 saw him lead 3–2, but he missed chances to take the win and was defeated 4–3. O'Sullivan said afterwards that Zhao's attacking style of play had reminded him of Stephen Hendry when he was a similar age. He qualified for the German Masters by beating Li Hang 5–3 and John Higgins 5–1 and a 5–0 thrashing of Akani Songsermsawad saw Zhao reach the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time. He held a narrow 4–3 advantage over Ali Carter, but lost the last two frames. Zhao was also edged out in the third round Gibraltar Open 4–3 by Mark Williams. ===2017/2018 season=== He dropped off the tour at the end of the 2017/18 season but entered Q School in a bid to win back his place.http://www.worldsnooker.com/zhao-storms-through- in-burton/http://www.worldsnooker.com/q-school-event-two-final-day-line-up/ He subsequently won back his place by beating Dechawat Poomjaeng in the second Event final of Q School.http://www.worldsnooker.com/brown-earns-tour-return/ ==Performance and rankings timeline== {  style=\\"font- size:85%;\\" - efefef;\\" !

The Colony of Natal introduced this system in August 1895 and, in 1897, instituted the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal).South African Medal Website – Colonial Military Forces (Accessed 6 May 2015) ==Origin== The United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted by King William IV in 1830. The original version had the Royal Coat of Arms with the badge of Hanover on the obverse, while on the Queen Victoria version, introduced upon her succession to the throne in 1837, the Hanover emblem was replaced by a Trophy of Arms which incorporated a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms. Upon the succession of King Edward VII to the throne in 1901, his effigy was placed on the medal's obverse. The medal's ribbon was plain crimson from 1830 until 1917, when white bands were added to the edges.Stephen Stratford Medals site - British Military & Criminal History - 1900 to 1999 - Army Long Service & Good Conduct Medal (Accessed 26 May 2015) The medal was originally awarded to soldiers of good conduct who had completed 21 years of service in the infantry or 24 years in the cavalry. From 1870, the qualifying period was reduced and the medal was awarded to soldiers of good conduct who had completed 18 years of service. ==Natal Colonial Forces== In the late 19th century, the military forces of the Colony of Natal consisted of the para-military Natal Police and a Volunteer Force, which was reorganised as the Natal Militia in 1904. The Natal Police and Natal Militia were amalgamated to form the Natal Colonial Forces in 1908. ==Institution== On 31 May 1895, Queen Victoria authorised Dominion and Colonial governments to adopt various military medals and to award them to their local military forces. The Colony of Natal introduced this system in August 1895. In 1897, one of three known medals which were instituted by Natal in terms of this authority was the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal). The Natal medal ranks on par with its British counterpart in the order of wear. Other territories which took advantage of the authorisation include Canada, Cape of Good Hope, India, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and, from 1901, the Commonwealth of Australia. (Accessed 26 May 2015) A second version of the medal, with the effigy of King Edward VII on the obverse, was awarded from 1901. The reverse of the medal remained the same, while the obverse of both versions is the same as that of their respective British counterparts. ==Award criteria== The Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) was awarded to non-commissioned officers and men who had completed eighteen years of irreproachable service in the ranks of the Natal Police or the Permanent Force of the Natal Colonial Forces. A recipient who was subsequently awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, had to stop wearing the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. ==Order of wear== In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) ranks on par with the United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military). It takes precedence after the Accumulated Campaign Service Medal and before the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (1830). ===South Africa=== With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African orders, decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) takes precedence as shown.Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals, published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Cape of Good Hope) Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal * Preceded by the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Cape of Good Hope). * Succeeded by the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal. ==Description== The medal was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick. The suspender is an ornamented scroll pattern swivelling type, affixed to the medal by means of a claw and a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal. On the Queen Victoria version, the suspender mount is a double-toe claw, while the King Edward VII version has a single-toe claw. King Edward VII version ;Obverse The obverse of the Queen Victoria version of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) is identical to that of the Queen Victoria version of the Distinguished Conduct Medal and shows a Trophy of Arms, incorporating a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms, without any inscription. The King Edward VII version has the effigy of the King and is inscribed \\"EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR\\" around the perimeter. Both versions have a raised rim. ;Reverse The reverse of both versions is smooth with a raised rim and bears the inscriptions \\"NATAL\\" in a curved line at the top and \\"FOR LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT\\" in four straight lines in the centre. The inscriptions are underlined by three dots between two spear blades at the bottom. ;Ribbon While the ribbon of the British Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was plain crimson until mid-1916, the ribbon of the Natal medal is 32 millimetres wide and crimson, with a 4 millimetres wide light yellow band in the centre. ==Discontinuation== Of the four Colonies which were to form the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Cape of Good Hope and the Colony of Natal adopted their own territorial versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The award of these medals was discontinued when the Union of South Africa was established in 1910 and began to award the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal, instituted in that same year as a single common award for long service and good conduct in the Permanent Forces of the Dominions and Colonies.South African Medal Website – Union Defence Forces (1913–1939) (Accessed 9 May 2015) ==References== Category:Military decorations and medals of South Africa 403.5 Category:Military decorations and medals of South Africa pre-1952 Category:Long and Meritorious Service Medals of Britain and the Commonwealth ","title":"Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal)"},{"id":"46818004","text":"The 2014–15 University of North Dakota women's basketball team represents the University of North Dakota during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

Plans for variables are intended for quality characteristics that are measured in a continuous scale. This plan requires the knowledge of the statistical model e.g. normal distribution. The historical evolution of this technique dates back to the seminal work of Wallis (1943). The purpose of a plan for variables is to assess whether the process is operating far enough from the specification limit. Plans for variables may produce a similar OC curve to attribute plans with significantly less sample size. The decision criterion of these plans are : \\\\bar{X}+ k\\\\sigma \\\\leqslant USL or \\\\bar{X}- k\\\\sigma \\\\geqslant LSL where \\\\bar{X} and \\\\sigma are the sample mean and the standard deviation respectively, k is the critical distance, USL and LSL are the upper and lower regulatory limits. When the above expression is satisfied the proportion nonconforming is lower that expected and therefore the lot is accepted. A variables sampling plan can be designed so that the OC curve passes through two points (AQL,\\\\alpha) and (LQL,\\\\beta).

The film premiered June 27, 2015 on Lifetime. ==Plot== A young girl named Amanda (Thorne) is obsessed with dance. She dislocates her knee during a school pep rally dance performance. She is rushed to a hospital where she is given the drug hydrocodone for pain. Upon returning to school, she is later approached by Riley (Bobadilla), who asks her to share one of her pills with her. Amanda is suspicious, but gives her one anyway. Later that week, Amanda starts dancing again, which makes Alexis (Jasmine Sky Sarin) a little jealous. While Amanda is waiting outside the school, Riley introduces Amanda to her boyfriend, Nate (Butler), and her brother, Carson (Broussard). Amanda ends up hanging out with the group. Although Amanda is hesitant at first, they convince her to share her prescription meds with them. Amanda ends up injuring her knee again and is given a renewed prescription of hydrocodone. Amanda is upset when she sees Carson and Bridget together at school again. She begins spending more time with Riley who persuades her to go for Carson. Amanda spends one day with Riley, Nate and Carson while watching movies and begins to grow a connection with Carson. While at an old lady's garage sale, they go into her house to use the bathroom and steal some oxycodone from her room and run out. While under the influence of the drugs, Carson and Amanda kiss and begin to spend more time together all the while Amanda's tolerance for the hydrocodone grows as she is shown taking the pills often. Unfortunately after her prescription runs out, she begins to feel sluggish and vomits due to withdrawal. Amanda ignores Carson's attempts to contact her until her birthday, where he approaches her while making an homage to her favorite movie, Say Anything..., and presents a slideshow of them together in an attempt to have her forgive him. Amanda is still very angry with him, but forgives him. Rick the dealer brings them drugs from Mexico to snort, claiming that it's cheap oxycontin. They snort the drugs and Amanda gets so high that she is slurring. She proceeds to black out, only regaining consciousness on her drive home when she almost crashes her car. She is later at Riley and Carson's house snorting the drug when they suddenly find out that they've actually been snorting heroin. Riley, just brushes it off, and Amanda makes Carson promise not to do it again. She again suffers from withdrawals. After hearing her vomit during dinner, her mother suspects that she has an eating disorder and takes her to a doctor who prescribes her anti-anxiety medication. Amanda's team decides to replace her solo with Alexis on the audition, angering her. She finds out that Carson and the others have been doing heroin again and fools herself into believing that it can get her through her dance audition. They go to Rick to trade Amanda's anti-anxiety pills for heroin, and discover Riley shooting heroin. The others are worried at first, but later decide to try it too. While high, Carson and Amanda profess their love for another, and the group continues to drug themselves. Later, after hanging with Nate, Amanda, and Carson getting Starbucks, Riley begins to act frantic and urges the rest of the group to go on. While in the car, in the backseat, Riley begins to shoot heroin. Amanda then sees Riley turn blue and not wake up. Carson immediately rushes them to the hospital, where they are told Riley overdosed. Sadly, Riley is presumed to have died, due to the heroin intoxication. When Amanda gets back home, her mother confronts her about the heroin in her room that her brother found. Amanda goes to rehab and starts dancing again. ==Cast== * Bella Thorne as Amanda * Israel Broussard as Carson * Daniela Bobadilla as Riley * Ross Butler as Nate * Matreya Fedor as Brooke *Jasmine Sky Sarin as Alexis *Cassidy Alexa as Bridget *Ryan Grantham as Robbie *Conni Attwell as Garage Sale Lady *Aren Buchholz as Rick *Lucia Walters as Coach Yost *Daelyn Anderton-Cahoon as Rhythm Chaser 1 ==ProductionPre-production=== On February 2, 2015 it was announced Bella Thorne was the final person cast as the main character Amanda, who becomes a heroin addict, alongside Israel Broussard, Daniela Bobadilla and Ross Butler who would all portray Thorne's character's friends.

Balistreri and Burrell Smith, who was then a Service Technician at Apple, designed the first software to track failures and compile service issues on the Apple II. In 1979, Balistreri left to join Moore Business Forms Inc, a provider a variety of forms for business applications. Balisteri designed hundreds of forms and systems for Moore and for their partner ASK Computer Systems. Using his experience from these companies, Balistreri left Moore in 1984 to start his first company, SigForms. ===SigForms=== SigForms was a company focused on creating both paper and electronic forms for business and software applications, and Balistreri was successfully able to develop relationships with software giants such as Oracle, Adobe, Lotus, JetForm and StreamServe Inc. By cultivating these relationships Balistreri was able to quickly grow his company, and in 1999 was named Silicon Valley's 9th fastest growing private company. The most notable distribution of SigForms products occurred when their forms were bundled with Lotus Software's cc:Mail 7 (distributed to 13 million users) and with Adobe Exchange (distributed to 3 million users). Both these forms were featured in major PC-related publications (the Lotus forms on the cover of PC Week, the Adobe forms in PC Magazine). This success led to the purchase of SigForms by StreamServe in 1999 (StreamServe was then acquired by Open Text in 2010). ===iMOS=== After leaving SigForms in 1999, Balistreri retired for several years. During his retirement, Balistreri started a small business, Minibike World, which manufactured and sold two minibike models, The Flee and Jonny Freestyle. In 2003, Balistreri left retirement and founded a business specializing in designing and maintaining websites for automobile dealerships, as well as providing technical expertise and marketing solution in order to help dealerships increase online vehicle sales. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Frank Balistreri"},{"id":"46818328","text":"Ustad Gul Mohammad Khan (1876–1979) was a Bangladeshi musician.

While rebel forces were battling Mexican 'Federales' for control of the neighboring town of Naco, Sonora, the Irish mercenary and pilot Patrick Murphy was hired to bombard the government forces with improvised explosives dropped from his biplane. During the ensuing fighting, Murphy mistakenly dropped bombs on the American side of the international border on three occasions, causing significant damage to both private and government-owned property, as well as slight injuries to several American spectators watching the battle from across the border. The bombing, although unintentional, is noted for being the first aerial bombardment of the continental United States by a foreign power in history. ==Background== Late in 1928, as the Cristero War was raging in western Mexico, a new revolutionary faction led by General José Gonzalo Escobar drafted the \\"Plan of Hermosillo\\" and occupied the copper mining town of Cananea, Sonora, not far from the international border with the United States. Encouraged by their successes early on, they next decided to take control of Agua Prieta and Naco, both situated on the border with Arizona, knowing many of the locals were sympathetic to their cause and thinking the revenue generated by these two towns would be a good source of income for the revolution. From there, General Escobar intended to carry the war south and ultimately oust Emilio Portes Gil and take his place as president. The battle for Naco began early the next year, on the night of March 31, 1929. The rebels later claimed that they waited until 8:00 PM to attack, so as not to harm any American citizens shopping on the Mexican side of the border. To start the attack, the rebels loaded a train car full of explosives and sent it down the tracks toward the center of town. Unfortunately for the rebels, their plan failed when the train car derailed and exploded before reaching its intended target. After their failure with the train car, the rebels sought outside help from the United States and found it in an Irish cropduster named Patrick Murphy. Other pilots were hired as well, and the Federales found a pilot of their own named Jon Gorre. According to a witness, Murphy and Gorre were friends and although hired by opposing sides, would take turns making bombing runs on the opposing forces in Naco, Sonora, and would spend the night drinking together and enjoying themselves. An Arizona citizen named Charlie Elledge saw much of the fighting in Naco, Sonora, while working to repair the roof of the immigration building along the border. Elledge says that Murphy and Gorre bought their homemade \\"suitcase bombs\\" from the same man and that about 200 people gathered on the American side of the border each day to watch the fighting, like they had during the Mexican Revolution a decade before. Some brought their children and picnic baskets with lunch and others climbed on top of train cars sitting idle along the border for a better view of the action. The men gambled with each other on where the bombs would fall. ===Suitcase bomb=== Diagram of the type of \\"suitcase bomb\\" dropped by Patrick Murphy and other pilots during the battle. The so-called \\"suitcase bombs\\" used by Murphy and the other pilots in Naco were improvised aerial bombs made by packing dynamite, scrap iron, nails, nuts and bolts and other small pieces of material to use as fragmentation into a steel cylinder with fins and an improvised warhead made of dynamite caps and a nail for a firing pin. The bombs were then stuffed in suitcases that could be attached to the side of the plane and opened during flight to deliver the payload. Other improvised bombs were made the same way using five-gallon gasoline cans. ==Bombing== Murphy dropped one suitcase bomb each on his first two bombing runs, both of which turned out to be duds, and it was his third pass before managed to hit anything: the Mexican custom house near where the crowd of American spectators had formed. The resulting explosion sent small bits of shrapnel and other fragments into the crowd of spectators and caused the American patrons of the bars and clubs on the Mexican side of the border to rush back to their side of the line. Among the casualties were a reporter and a photographer, along with many others, but nobody was killed and all of the injuries were considered minor. After realizing the danger of watching the battle from such a short distance away, the crowd dispersed and went home, some to Fry and Buena. Neither Murphy or any of the other pilots were very successful in hitting their targets, but the high winds which regularly blow in the region in late spring and early summer most likely contributed to their inaccuracy. The first bomb to actually hit Arizona soil landed at 7:45 AM on April 2 and it was followed by others over the next few days. Murphy's bombing runs smashed windows and otherwise damaged several buildings on the American side of the border, including a garage, the Phelps-Dodge Mercantile and the Haas Pharmacy. One bomb also struck the post office building, making it a federal offense, and another landed next to one of the idle train cars used by the crowd of spectators. Other bombs left large craters in the dirt streets and other unpaved surfaces. Yet another bomb landed on and devastated a regal Dodge touring car owned by a Mexican Army officer, which had been left on the American side of the border for safekeeping during the expected hostilities. Murphy's bombs were responsible for at least a few deaths on the Mexican side of the border, but nobody was killed on the American side. The Americans suffered more casualties over the following days as bombs landed on their side, but none of the injuries were life-threatening. The final bombardment took place on April 6, when the rebels launched their final attack to take control of the city. Murphy was shot down by Mexican soldiers the following day, but he managed to escape and get across the border, where he was quickly arrested by American authorities. He was released for unspecified reasons after only a couple nights in jail. After being repulsed in their final attack, the rebels retreated to Cananea by way of Agua Prieta, marking the beginning of the end of the revolution in the north. ==Aftermath== The United States Army was slow in responding to the situation, having closed all military posts in Arizona the same year, with the exception of Fort Huachuca. Fort Huachuca, which is relatively close to Naco, sent two companies of Buffalo Soldiers to occupy Naco, Arizona, and prevent the fighting from spreading into American territory. The commander of the detachment positioned his men along the border and had them prepare to attack at a moment's notice while he crossed the border and demanded that the rebel commanders stop dropping bombs on the Arizona side. By this time, however, the rebels were already defeated, and so the Buffalo Soldiers never had to engage. A squadron of eighteen warplanes was also dispatched from somewhere in Texas to shoot down any plane violating American airspace, but it never went into action either, and was withdrawn sometime later without incident. Murphy never faced charges for his bombing of Naco, Arizona, which became the first aerial bombardment of the continental United States by a foreign power in American history. According to local rumor, the rebel commander, General Escobar, kept a plane loaded with gold near the border so he could escape if the revolution collapsed. When it did, Escobar abandoned his troops and flew into Arizona, where he asked for and received asylum from the local authorities. The rebellion officially came to an end not long after the incident in Naco. ==Popular culture== \\"The Bombing of Naco\\" is an American folk song written by Dolan Ellis and is found on his album Tall Tales, Lost Trails & HeroesTracks and Trails - Sounds, tucsoncitizen.com; 21-12-2000 ==See also== * Siege of Naco * Bombing of Dutch Harbor * Lookout Air Raids ==References== Category:Escobar Rebellion Category:1929 in Arizona Category:Conflicts in 1929 Category:History of Cochise County, Arizona Category:April 1929 events ","title":"Bombing of Naco"},{"id":"46818385","text":"Karl Fochler (1898–1982) was an Austrian actor who made over sixty film and television appearances.Giesen p.208 He featured in a number of stage productions. ==Filmography== {  - !
