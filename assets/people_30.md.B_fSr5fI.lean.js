With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Washington (state) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Oval Peak weather: Mountain Forecast * Aerial photo of North Face: PBase Category:Mountains of Washington (state) Oval Peak Category:North Cascades ","title":"Oval Peak"},{"id":"46866568","text":"The Journal of Plant Physiology is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering all areas of plant physiology.

At age 12 he moved with a relative to Bureau County, Illinois, which was at that time the far West. He spent four years there working on a farm. The nearest school was three miles away, and he attended school only a few weeks each winter. Smith's first wife was Lavinia Winberg Gorgas, daughter of George Gorgas of Philadelphia. They married on December 12, 1849 and had two children. She died February 26, 1857, aged 23 years. In 1858 Smith married Mary Ann Fish, daughter of John and Nancy Fish of East Greenwich, Rhode Island; they had one daughter. Smith was an active mason for over forty years. He died in his home at 315 Elmwood Avenue in Providence of pneumonia, early in the morning of August 12, 1907. He had been bedridden for a week, and unconscious for three days. ==Jewelry career== By age 18, Smith was in Newark, New Jersey, learning the jewelry trade. He returned to Rhode Island, eventually working for Sackett, Davis, & Co, jewelers on Richmond Street in Providence. Jewelry manufacture and trade was emerging as one of the major industries in Providence at the time. By some accounts, there were 57 firms and 590 workers in the jewelry trade in pre-Civil War Providence. ==Civil War== In September 1861, after the start of the Civil War, Smith joined the 4th Rhode Island Infantry, where he became First lieutenant and quartermaster under General Parke. He took part in Burnside's North Carolina Expedition and participated in the battles of Roanoke, New Bern, and Fort Macon. He returned to Rhode Island in Fall 1862, once again working for Sackett, Davis & Co, where he eventually became superintendent. In 1870 he partnered with Samuel W. Saxton of New York to form Saxton, Smith & Co, which made solid gold chains. He was also president of the United Wire and Supply Company. ==Political life== Smith served in politics for over thirty years. He served on the common council, state assembly, and state senate before running for mayor. He was elected mayor in 1890 and served for one term. His efforts to bring law and order to Providence resulted in his defeat for re-election by a \\"tolerant electorate [which was] inclined to look the other way.\\" After his mayorship, Smith was elected Commissioner of Sinking Funds. == References == Category:1828 births Category:Mayors of Providence, Rhode Island Category:1907 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:American jewellers Category:Rhode Island Republicans Category:People from Warren, Rhode Island Category:American Freemasons Category:19th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Charles Sydney Smith (mayor)"},{"id":"46866708","text":"Eduardo Trillini (born 20 June 1958) is an Argentine former cyclist.

William H. Allen & Co. London. pg. 493 Liquid measures The country didn't have a unified system of liquid measurement in the 19th century because the Afrikaners used the Dutch gallon and the British used the Imperial gallon. When measuring alcohol, the British system was used only for ale and beer and the Dutch system was used only for wine, brandy and distilled spirits. This was due to specialization in the two colonies, which were not united until 1910. Vintning was more common among the Boer farmers of the Western Cape, who dominated the industry. Meanwhile, the British farmers grew grain that could be brewed into beer. Wine was for export and beer, which was perishable, was for domestic consumption. Each community used their own standard measurement systems to store, sell and ship their wares. =Ale & beer= The firkin, kilderkin, barrel, hogshead, and butt were traditional British measurements of capacity for standard ale and beer containers. They were based on the British ale gallon. (Once there were different measures for ale and beer before the Ale gallon measure became standard for both in 1688; the Ale gallon then became the Imperial gallon in 1824). :1 firkin [9 Imp. gal.]: A Dutch word meaning \\"little Fourth\\"; a measure that was a fourth of a barrel.

It was rounded down to 340 ml when South Africa converted to the metric system in 1970. The 340 ml capacity also became the standard volume for beer and soda cans until 2007, when the bottling plants converted to the 330 ml European standard. It has since been replaced by long-necked 330 ml beer bottles. :\\"Quart\\" [750 ml, 0.659 (≈0.66) Imp. fl. qt.]: The standard 750 ml wine bottle (about 2/3 of an Imperial quart) was also used for beer until 2008. Wine bottles were more fragile than the heavier Dumpies, making them harder to recycle. Under the South African Breweries (SAB) Project Calabash initiativeBizCommunity.com, , Project Calabash sees end of an era for iconic quart bottle (15 August 2008) in 2008 a new 750ml bottle that was longer lasting and easier to recycle was introduced. It has a cylindrical body with a necked-down conical neck, resembling a scaled-up Pilsner beer pint bottle. =Wine= The Dutch East India company used the Cape of Good Hope as a waystation between Europe and the East Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Dutch sailors drank the local wine to combat scurvy and exported barrels of it back to Europe. This was followed by the British government's policy of encouraging the wine and brandy industry in South Africa in the early- to mid-19th century through subsidies and low tariffs. (Their recent isolation during Napoleon's Continental System impressed upon them that they would potentially need alternative sources of European commodities in the future.) The kanne, anker, ahm, and legger are obsolete 17th century Dutch measurements of capacity that were used for standard containers of wine and spirits. The standard \\"Dutch gallon\\" used was based on that of Amsterdam.Martin, Robert Montgomery.Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia, Austral-Asia, and Europe (1839). William H. Allen & Co. London. pg. 493 They were typically sold in ankers, half-aums, and leggersBriggs, William.Clive's South African arithmetics - Standard IV(1907). University Tutorial Press, London p.18 until 1922, when the Imperial measurement system went into effect. :1 kanne (can) = legger [ (≈0.343) Dutch gallons, iters, 1.17 Imp. qts.] A Dutch and German term for a measure of alcohol that was enough to fill a standard wine flagon (flapkan). The term kanne was also used for different-sized measures of beer, milk or whale oil that varied from region to region. :1 flask = [ (≈0.6) Dutch gallons, iters, 1.978 (≈2) Imp. qts.] A term for a measure of alcohol that was enough to fill a large wine bottle. South Africa eventually adopted the standard French 750-ml bottle. :1 half-anker = 12.125 (≈12) kannen, ahm = legger [4.75 Dutch gallons, iters, 3.958 (≈4) Imp. gals.] :1 anker = 24.25 (≈24) kannen, ahm = legger [9.5 Dutch gallons, iters, 7.9143 (≈8) Imp. gals.] A Dutch term for a small wine or brandy cask. :1 half-aum = 48.5 (≈48) kannen, 2 anker = legger [19 Dutch gallons, iters, 15.8286 (≈16) Imp. gals.] A measure roughly equivalent to a British rundlet [68.19 (≈68) liters, 15 Imperial gallons]. :1 ahm (aum) = 97 kannen = 4 anker = legger. [38 Dutch gallons, iters, 31.6572 (≈32) Imp. gals.] An ahm (anglicised as \\"aum\\" - using the French spelling) was a Dutch and German measure of wine that was a fourth of a legger. It was also roughly equivalent to a British tierce [159.1 (≈159) liters, 35 Imp. gals.], a measure equal to a third of a butt. :1 half-pipe [55 Dutch gallons, iters, 45. (≈46) Imp. gals.] :1 pipe [110 Dutch gallons, iters, 91. (≈92) Imp. gals.]: A wine cask based on the Spanish pipa of Cadiz that was introduced to Britain via the garrison of Gibraltar. The British adopted several different sized 'pipes' that varied in capacity depending on the contents (like hard cider, brandy, wine, or fortified wine). The South African wine 'pipe' was based on the Madeira 'pipe' of 92 Imperial gallons. :1 half-leaguer = 194 kannen = 8 anker = 2 ahm [76 Dutch gallons, 287.849 (≈288) liters, 63.318 (≈64) Imp. gals.] A measure roughly equivalent to a British hogshead. :1 legger (leaguer) = 388 kannen = 16 anker = 4 ahm [152 Dutch gallons, 575.67 (≈576) liters, 126. (≈127) Imp. gals.] A legger (anglicised as \\"leaguer\\") was a Dutch term for a large barrel of wine, roughly equivalent to a British butt [477.3 (≈477) liters, 105 Imperial gallons]. =Gasoline= Gasoline was formerly sold in Imperial gallons [1 Imp. gal. = 4.55 l], but was switched to litres after the adoption of the metric system. ==References== Category:South African culture South Africa ","title":"South African units of measurement"},{"id":"46866745","text":"Tar Beach, written and illustrated by Faith Ringgold, is a children's picture book published by Crown Publishers, Inc., 1991.

Gold, diamonds, and iron ore form the core minerals of the mining sector with a new Mineral Development Policy and Mining Code being put in place to attract foreign investments. In 2013, the mineral sector accounted for 11% of GDP in the country and the World Bank has projected a further increase in the sector by 2017. Mining sector is considered the prime mover for the economic growth of the country and its exploitation has to be appropriately balanced with sustainable environmental preservation of its rich biodiversity. Apart from iron ore extractions, cement, diamond, gold, and petroleum resources have also been given due importance to enrich the economy of the country. ==History== In the 1970s, one of the most productive gold districts in western Liberia was identified to be Gondoja-Ndablama and Gbarpoly Kongba Community Gold Mines Ltd. Prior to 1990, mineral exports accounted for the country's export earnings, and it amounted to 25% of its gross domestic product (GDP). However, during the civil wars that lasted for 14 years till 2003, many major mines stopped operation and resulted in near zero contribution to the nation's economy. While mineral resources in Liberia had remained largely untapped, its alluvial gold has been exploited by the artisanal miners for a long time. By 2004, diamond drilling programmes were underway at KGL, Weaju and Gondoja, while gold prospecting was in operation at Butter Hill, Benjeh, Ndablama and Soso Camp. In 2012, there was a significant discovery of petroleum, which remains to be extracted. The source is said to have a potential of one billion barrels. ==Production and impact== Officially, extraction of diamonds was 155,000 carats as of 2001, but the quantity illegally smuggled to the neighboring countries of Sierre Leone, Guinea and Ivory Coast was reportedly much higher. Other significant minerals reported are bauxite, beryl, chromite, columbite-tantalite, copper, kyanite, lead, molybdenum, nickel, phosphates, rare earth minerals, silica sands, tin, uranium and zinc, and also beach sands which have zircon, rutile, ilmenite, and monazite. ==Legal framework== The enabling laws that govern mineral sector development are: the Mining and Minerals Law of 2000; the Mineral Policy of March 1, 2010; environmental protection guidelines for mineral exploration and exploitation issued by the National Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia; and the MLME. It is mandatory to conduct an environmental impact assessment including social impacts of all mineral exploration projects undertaken by private companies. The Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME) has the mandated task to administer the mining activity in the country. The mining laws are patterned on the Australian system. ==Commodities== Iron ore extraction has seen a revival in the private sector with projects undertaken by several foreign companies such as: the Putu iron ore project in Grand Gedeh County; the western iron ore deposits in Nimba County; and the Western Cluster Iron Ore (WCIO) project including the Bea Mountain, Bomi Hills, and Mano River iron ore deposits. Mining of the iron ore has witnessed substantial growth in recent years. Diamond and gold mines are under active development since 2010 under many agreements signed with the private sector. The New Liberty Gold (NLG) mine covering an area of is under exploration and extraction under a license granted to the private sector company, African Aura. The Gondoja Hills area which is located to the north east of Weaju is considered productive. In the Bea Mountain region, the Larjor and Kinjor camps are major hard rock artisanal mining locations. Gbarpolu County still remains one of Liberia most fertile county for gold mining. == Environmental concerns ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Mining in Liberia Category:Economy of Liberia Liberia ","title":"Mining industry of Liberia"},{"id":"46866966","text":"Harry Kramer (born 1939) is an American abstract painter, born in Philadelphia, PA.

It has the largest and most complete collection of fully restored U.S. military cargo and tanker aircraft in the Eastern United States and is located about 1/2 mile south of Dover Air Force Base. The mission of the museum is to collect, preserve and exhibit the artifacts and human stories significant to the development and employment of military airlift and air refueling in the USAF and the USAAF, as well as to portray the history of Dover Air Force Base. == Museum history == While the museum itself was not officially established until 1986, the idea for the museum developed as a result of an Air Force Reserve restoration project on the B-17G bomber \\"Shoo Shoo Baby\\" in 1978. This aircraft became the first of many to be restored for eventual display at the museum, which was still in the early stages of conceptualization. Then in 1986, preparations were formally advanced for the creation of an air museum at Dover AFB. At the same time, the C-47A \\"Turf and Sport Special\\" also underwent restoration, having been rejected by many other museums as \\"beyond salvage.\\" The then Dover AFB Historical Center was officially recognized by the U.S. Air Force in 1995, moved from three hangars in the main area of the base to its present location in Hangar 1301 in June 1996, and its name was changed to Air Mobility Command Museum in February 1997. Hangar 1301 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance as the site of the US Army Air Force's rocket test center, and was restored in the 1990s. The facility encloses over 20,000 square feet of aircraft display gallery plus 1,300 square feet of exhibit rooms. Additionally, an attached 6,400 square foot building houses a theater, museum store, exhibit workshop, and various offices. The surrounding 100,000 square feet of outdoor ramp space allows for a closer inspection of the remaining aircraft in the collection. == Airlift history == Dover Air Force Base was originally built as a civilian airport that was modified for military use as a result of Public Law 812, which funded local governments to build airports in response to the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia in 1939-40. Ten days after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the War Department employed its emergency powers to lease Dover Municipal Airfield for the entirety of World War II. The air field would serve primarily as a base for anti-submarine operations, fighter pilot training, and aerial rocket testing and development. In September 1946, after the end of the war, Dover Army Airfield was placed in \\"inactive\\" status. Following the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service entity, the Airfield became Dover Air Force Base on January 13, 1948. Beginning in 1952, the primary mission of DAFB focused on military airlift due to the strategic location of the base on the Eastern Seaboard, and the base was designated as a permanent U.S. Air Force installation on December 22, 1953. During the Military Air Transport Service's existence from 1948 to 1965, a number of aircraft were utilized, such as the C-46, C-47, C-54, C-74 Globemaster, C-97 Stratofreighter, C-118, C-121, C-124, C-130, C-131, C-133, KC-135, and the C-141. Many are on display at the AMCM. The Military Airlift Command was another major command of the United States Air Force from 1966 to 1992. During this time, the Air Force was involved in such conflicts as the Vietnam War, Cold War, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, as well as humanitarian efforts including Operation Provide Comfort and the relief of former USSR satellite nations following its dissolution. Many of the aircraft in the museum's collection are from this era. Air Mobility Command, the current major command, was established June 1, 1992, and has been in existence ever since. Several aircraft from this period are in the museum's collection, including the C-141, C-9, and the C-130. Operational aircraft such as the C-5M and the C-17A that launch from the active side of Dover Air Force Base are visible from the museum as well. == Collections and exhibits  Aircraft collection === The Air Mobility Command Museum is home to a number of significant vintage aircraft from a variety of eras and major commands. Additionally, the AMC Museum houses a complete set of all significant Lockheed air lifters used by the Air Force and Army since World War II.

The dinoflagellate is endemic in temperate and tropical areas, and is capable of successfully adapting to a variety of different environments and to a great number of hosts, having been identified in four phyla of aquatic organisms: Chordata, Arthropoda, Mollusca and Platyhelminthes. Moreover, it is the only dinoflagellate capable of infecting teleosts and elasmobranchs . The parasite represents a serious problem for both reared and aquarium fish, since amyloodiniosis, the infection caused by this protozoan, can lead the host to death in less than 12 hours, with acute morbidity and mortality around 100%. However, these two parameters vary considerably on the basis of farming typology, parasite burden, fish species and season considered. In general, amyloodiniosis is typically present in land- or lagoon-based rearing sites (valliculture or inland brackish farming), where shallow seabeds and poor water exchange/recirculation allow the parasite to reach its optimal proliferation values. Especially in the warmest months, A. ocellatum causes high mortality rates and economic damages. == Taxonomy == Phylum: Alveolata, Class: Dinophyceae, Order: Thoracosphaerales, Family: Thoracosphaeraceae, Genus: Amyloodinium, Species: Amyloodinium ocellatum ==Life cycle== Simplified scheme of the life cycle of Amyloodinium ocellatum. (Dr P. Beraldo, University of Udine) The lifecycle of A. ocellatum is direct and divided in three phases. In general, it can be completed in five to seven days when temperature and salinity are between 23-27°C and 30-35 ppt respectively. However, the parasite can also express its virulence in extreme conditions. In particular, lethal outbreaks were documented at high temperatures (more than 35°C) in both salt water (46 ppt) and brackish (7 ppt) environments. The parasitic stage is represented by the sessile trophont. In this phase, the protist is pear-shaped, enclosed in a cellulose wall and exhibits specific structures, rhizoids (tentacle like processes) that enable it to strictly anchor to host epithelia (gill or skin predominantly). If the infection is severe, trophonts can also be found on eyes, fins and in all oropharigeal cavity, the latter is a typical infection site in the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Constantly moving while anchored and therefore causing physical injuries to cells, trophonts inflict serious damages to the host, potentially inducing its death in 12-48 hours as a function of the parasite burden. Based on data in the literature, the trophont feeds directly from the host cells, probably using the stomopode by releasing digestive enzymes, which exacerbate the rhizoid lesions. Trophont size can vary considerably, with early trophonts measuring 27×23 µm while mature ones can reach up to 130×60 µm and more. Two to six days after feeding, the trophont detaches from the host and encysts on inert substrates (pond/tank bottom or seabed) transforming into the tomont: the reproductive stage. In this phase, the protozoan is round and encapsulated in a cellulose wall, which becomes thicker and confers upon it an exceptional resistance to unfavourable conditions and to several therapeutic treatments. The protozoan reproduces asexually, the first division is longitudinal while the succeeding ones are approximately regular and at right angles to each other. Potentially, in two to four days, from a single tomont, 256 new dinospores can be generated. The number of newly formed dinospores is directly correlated to the nutritive state of the trophont. The dinospore (8–13.5 × 10–12.5 μm), whose antero- posteriorly compressed shape resembles a hamburger, is the infective stage. In this phase, the armoured (cellulose wall) protist is capable of active swimming thanks to two flagella: one longitudinal, the other transverse. After adhesion to a new host, the dinospore transforms into a trophont within 5 to 20 minutes. ==Pathology and clinical signs== Trophont of Amyloodinium ocellatum anchored to European sea bass gill epithelium. (Dr. P. Beraldo, University of Udine) A. ocellatum is the etiological agent of the so called “marine velvet disease” or amyloodiniosis (in the past it was also known as oodiniosis, as the protozoan was originally named Oodinium ocellatum). This infection is extremely dangerous and sometimes lethal for hosts, since it injures the animals and promotes secondary bacterial infections. All fish life stages may be susceptible if they are naïve to A. ocellatum. The protozoan pathogenicity is associated with the trophont attachment to host tissues; trophonts constantly twist and turn, slowly damaging and killing several host cells. They inflict moderate-to-intense tissue reactions associated with serious gill hyperplasia, inflammation, haemorrhages and necrosis with subsequent death in less than 12 hours in heavy infected specimens. However, some mortalities were also documented in subclinical or mild infections as a probable consequence of osmoregulatory impairment and secondary microbial infections due to the serious epithelial damage. Usually host behavioural changes are the first amyloodiniosis symptoms, represented by jerky movements (flashing), pruritus and dyspnoea with gathering at the water surface. Lethargy and anorexia appear in the advanced stages of the infection. Another clinical sign of amyloodiniosis could be the dusty appearance of the skin (hence the name “marine velvet disease”), as in European sea bass, but not in all fish species. == Impact == A. ocellatum represents a serious problem not only for reared fish but also for those kept in aquaria. Depending on interactions with farming typology, parasite burden, fish species and season, amyloodiniosis can lead the host to death in less than 12-48 hours, with acute morbidity and mortality around 100%. Generally, the infection affects land- or lagoon-based rearing sites (valliculture or inland brackish farming), whose characteristics (shallow seabeds and poor water exchange/recirculation) enable the parasite to best express its virulence. In the warmest months, when the parasite reaches its optimal proliferation rate, A. ocellatum is capable of causing high mortality rates and economic damage. == Diagnosis == A.ocellatum severe infection in European sea bass gills (Dr P. Beraldo, University of Udine) Diagnosis of amyloodiniosis consists of observing typical clinical signs and using nonlethal techniques. A cytological approach by wet mount examinations of skin scrapes and gill biopsies is recommended to detect trophonts. Anaesthetized small-size fish can be directly observed under a stereomicroscope by gently lifting the opercular structure. The same approach can also be adopted for post-mortem fish, though it is better to examine fish that are freshly dead, as parasites often detach shortly after host death. Dropping some diluted Lugol’s iodine onto skin or gills can help to improve A. ocellatum detection, since the iodine reacts with the starch-containing trophonts, colouring them in dark brown/black. Molecular identification can be applied as a second, confirmatory, diagnostic step in addition to clinical and microscopic identification. Recently developed molecular approaches (PCR and LAMP) have been proven to provide early detection of dinoflagellates in water and gill tissue samples, even when the parasite is present at lowest concentrations, such as in subclinical infections. Therefore, these methods potentially allow for highly sensitive monitoring of pathogen load in susceptible fish populations. Molecular diagnosis of A. ocellatum is based on primers AO18SF (5' GACCTTGCCCGAGAGGG 3') and AO18SR (5' GGTGTTAAGATTCACCACACTTTCC 3') for PCR amplification of a 248 bp segment of the 3’ end of the LSU rDNA gene. Multiple sequence alignment using the CLUSTALw confirmed that sequenced AO was conserved with different geographic isolates from Mediterranean Sea (DQ490256.1), Red sea (DQ490257.1), Fujian-China (KU761581.1 and KR057921.1), Southern Mississippi-USA (JX905204.1). However, these techniques are still limited to laboratory contexts. In parallel, immunological approaches such as ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) can detect the specific anti-A. ocellatum antibody levels in fish recovering from amyloodiniosis outbreaks or that have been experimentally exposed to the parasite. The ELISA assay might be useful for monitoring levels of protection in susceptible populations, as elevated antibody titres have been associated with resistance. == Treatments == From the 1930s, several efforts have been performed to try to control amyloodiniosis in various fish species, but no treatment has proven to be totally effective or licensed worldwide. Early diagnosis followed by a prompt treatment is crucial as the protozoan has exponential reproductive potential in the warmest months, temperature affects how quickly the parasites multiply. Chemical treatments include formalin (36% formaldehyde at a concentration of 4mg/L for 7 hours or 51mg/L for 1 hour), hydrogen peroxide (75 and 150mg/L for 30min and repeated after 6 days), copper sulphate and chloroquine (5-10 mg/L water). However, only dinospores show significant susceptibility to some drugs, while trophonts and tomonts are more resistant. Copper sulphate is one of the most effective treatments to control A. ocellatum epidemics in aquaculture, due to the proven dinosporicide properties of the free copper ion, but also because it is inexpensive and easy to find. The infusion of copper sulphate at 0.75-1 g/m3 for almost two weeks by dripping on ponds/tanks, maintaining constant copper concentration, is very effective to kill dinospores, while tomonts and trophonts are not very susceptible. Currently, copper sulphate is not approved by the European Regulation n. 1907/2006 (REACH) as amyloodiniosis treatment, despite its approval as an effective algaecide. Freshwater baths are an effective way to detach trophonts from skin and gill epithelium due to the sudden osmotic shock experienced by the host. However, freshwater bath procedures remain impractical for the majority of marine fish farms and some fish species cannot tolerate a similar treatment. == Other control strategies == Control strategies are intended as preventive measures to avoid dangerous outbreaks as A. ocellatum cannot be totally controlled. An effective filtration system and proper sanitation procedures (i.e. the use of UV rays combined with mechanical filtration of the intake water) can contribute to reducing the risk of the infection. It is important to emphasise that dinospores can be transported through aerosol droplets, therefore contaminating farm equipment and/or contiguous ponds/tanks as well as nearby facilities if spread by strong winds. For this reason, scrupulous disinfection protocols of materials and adequate management practices should be considered mandatory in farms. Another aspect that can be taken into account is the choice of an appropriate rearing site. Parasitosis can be influenced by its characteristics. Normally, sea cage reared fish are not affected by the infection, while it is more difficult to control the infection in valliculture or inland brackish farming systems. Prevention of the disease by vaccination is not possible, although some studies are in progress to identify potential vaccine candidate proteins, i.e. i-antigens, of the parasite. Fish that survive amyloodiniosis may develop at least a partial immunity. == Research == Since 1931 (year of the first A. ocellatum report), numerous investigations have been conducted. The biology and ecology of the protozoan were precisely described between the 1930s and 1940s and elaborated in the following decades. In 1984, Paperna determined the environmental characteristics influencing the virulence of A. ocellatum in its three stages. Three years later, Noga successfully established an in vitro propagation protocol, which was fundamental for the implementation of important laboratory surveys. An alternative to this protocol, based on in vitro maintenance of tomonts’ in a hibernation status, was recently developed by a group of researchers of the University of Udine within the Horizon2020 Project ParaFishControl. Within the framework of this project, researchers are currently investigating alternative therapeutants and developing more targeted prophylaxis measures against the protozoan. Although ambitious, the aim of the project is to create a vaccine against A. ocellatum. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Francis-Floyd, Ruth, and Maxine R. Floyd.

The Pashkov family, a family of iconographers in Moscow, had a high reputation for decades and had the patronage of the Imperial family. Georgy Pashkov and his brothers Pavel and Nikolai graduated from the Stroganov Art School and became successful Moscow artists. They were appreciated as decorators. The Pashkov brothers participated in a number of important decorating projects supported by the Russian Royal Family. In 1912, Georgy Pashkov with his brother Nikolai decorated the lower church of the Feodorovsky Imperial Cathedral in Tsarskoye Selo.

Watson, Rebekah Harkness, whose name became associated with the building when she used it as the offices of the Harkness Ballet. In 2011, the home was purchased by Larry Gagosian, who demolished the mansion's interior. ==Construction== The mansion was built for Nathaniel L’Hommediue McCready, Jr., a stockbroker, and his wife, Jeanne Borrowe McCready. The McCreadies purchased two plots on 75th Street in 1894, and commissioned Trowbridge, Colt & Livingston to design a -wide French Renaissance-inspired mansion. The building was completed in January 1896 with interior floor space of . The building's limestone facade a second-story iron balcony are characteristic of many houses constructed on the same block in following decades. ==Ownership== The house was sold to V. Everit Macy and Edith Carpenter Macy in 1917, who converted it to a rest house for American combatants in World War I. After the war, the house passed to Stanley Mortimer and Elizabeth Livingston Hall. They redecorated the home with Stanley Mortimer's art collection. In 1940, the house was sold to Thomas J.

It was released on June 16, 2015, by Fueled by Ramen. The album was produced by Some Nights producer Jeff Bhasker. Following the hiatus of Fun, Ruess announced that he would be working on material for a solo project. The album received a generally positive reception but critics said that it was overly theatrical in terms of production, lyricism and vocal delivery. Grand Romantic debuted at number 7 on the Billboard 200 and spawned four singles: \\"Nothing Without Love\\", \\"AhHa\\", \\"Great Big Storm\\" and \\"What This World Is Coming To\\". ==Promotion== On June 10, the album was made available for streaming on the MTV website. Later the same day, the \\"AhHa\\" visualizer video was released. ==Critical reception== Grand Romantic received positive reviews but music critics were divided over Ruess' musical vision in terms of production, lyrics and performance. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 10 reviews. Awarding the album four of five stars, Jack Appleby of Alternative Press wrote that \\"Grand Romantic is proof- positive more Nate Ruess is always a good thing.\\" Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone was positive towards the album's theatrical production and upbeat optimism, saying that, \\"Fun. co-producers Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie help Ruess create richly orchestrated bombast with the right amount of sonic wanderlust.\\" Matt Collar of AllMusic praised the collaboration of Ruess, Bhasker and Haynie for creating a project that embraces the concept of love, calling it \\"a fittingly grandiose, occasionally silly, passionately effusive, and ultimately very catchy album.\\" Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club saw potential in the album's themes but said that it was brought down by subdued production and lyrical content with neither depth or conflict in its romantic tales, concluding that \\"Grand Romantic often feels so preoccupied with grandiose gestures that it loses sight of the little details that in the past have made Ruess’ music so memorable.\\" Alfred Soto of Spin criticized Ruess for his inability to tone down his singing style or deliver songs that stood out on the album. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News compared the album negatively to Adam Lambert's The Original High saying that while both are musically similar, Lambert's voice performs campy theatrics better than Ruess' unsubtle delivery, saying that \\"[T]here's no roundness, or richness, to his tone. It's all hard angles, offering no cushion for the screech.\\" == Film == Alongside the release of this album, The Grand Romantic, a 28 minute short film starring Nate Ruess was also released.

The Ida Leona Mine from www.riversideca.gov/library Riverside Public Library website, accessed 6/1/2015 ==History== It is unknown how much gold these mines produced but they were worked from at least 1855 and perhaps earlier by Californio and New Mexican miners from Agua Mansa.Lech, Steve, Pioneers of Riverside County: The Spanish, Mexican and Early American Periods, The History Press, Charleston, SC, 2012 The mines were on the property of the Rancho El Sobrante de San Jacinto which by 1893 had come into the hands of an English syndicate, the San Jacinto Estate Limited of London. The California Journal of Mines and Geology, Volume 11, 1893 reports these Gavilan Mines: :\\"... years ago produced from quartz veins considerable gold, the rock being first crushed in numerous arrastras, the beds of which, to the number of fifty or more, are still scattered all about the neighborhood of the mines.\\" :\\"The veins of the Gavilan Mines are not large, but of good grade, occurring in a granitoid rock. ... The Mexicans worked a large shoot down to the water-line, and judging from the size and number of the dumps these old workings must have been of great extent.\\" :\\"In later years, under American management, the quartz was hauled to a stamp mill in the Pinacate District.\\" :\\"At the time the rancho became the property of the English people nothing had been done in these mines for many years.\\" California Journal of Mines and Geology, Volume 11, 1893, pp.366-367 M. C. Westbrook and Associates, leased most of the mining area from the English syndicate in 1891, planning a town site at the mines called Westbrook. :\\"During the past two years the old workings have been investigated and a local company organized at Riverside to operate them under lease.\\" However, when the report writer visited the mines in 1893: :\\"At the time of my visit some workmen were industriously engaged in taking down the gallows frame of the hoist and making preparations to vacate the premises, and this in the face of the report that had gone abroad that a good-sized vein of pay rock had been uncovered at the bottom of the mine at the depth of 180 feet. I did not see the alleged ore shoot and could get no satisfaction from the men at work other than vague hints that there was dissension among the Board of Directors.\\" Shortly afterward Westbrook and Associates sold the lease to the mines to the Gavilan Mining and Milling Company for a period of ten years. The old Gavilan mine ceased to be mined in the 1890s. The Ida Leona mine continued to be worked and was most active in the 1930s and finally closed in 1942, having produced $50,000. Russell V.

The case drew widespread attention for its unusual nature — Valle was dubbed the \\"Cannibal Cop\\" — and because of the legal issue of whether describing criminal activities crosses the line into criminal intent. Valle was convicted by a jury in March 2013 of conspiracy to kidnap. The judge in the case, Paul Gardephe, overturned the verdict 16 months later. The circuit court later affirmed the acquittal in December 2015, but the prosecution's appeal could yet go to the Supreme Court. ==Background== Gilberto Valle was born in Queens, New York, in 1984, and attended Archbishop Molloy High School. He attended the University of Maryland, graduating in 2006 with a degree in psychology. Valle joined the New York City Police Department in 2006, and was assigned to the 26th Precinct in Morningside Heights, Manhattan. He married Kathleen Cooke Mangan, whom he had met on the dating website OKCupid, in 2010 in Spokane, Washington. They had a daughter in early 2012. He was fired from the NYPD following his arrest. ==Chats and arrest== On October 25, 2012, Valle was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping. The arrest occurred after his wife reported to police that she had found in his Internet search engine history a series of chat room communications on Dark Fetish Net, a forum dedicated to sexual fetishes and fantasies involving torture, rape, murder and cannibalism. Valle had been chatting with another user about torturing and murdering his wife, as well as murdering and cannibalizing more than 100 other women. ==Trial== Valle faced a maximum of life in prison for the conspiracy charge, and a maximum of five years for accessing the federal National Crime Information Center database without authorization. Valle's wife testified against him during the trial. Throughout the trial, Valle claimed that the chat room communications were mere fantasy, and that he had no intention of acting on them. He was found guilty of all charges in March 2013. Judge Paul G. Gardephe of Federal District Court overturned Valle's conviction on the conspiracy charge in June 2014, saying the evidence supported his contention that he was engaged in only \\"fantasy role-play.\\" Valle had at this point served 21 months in prison. The lesser conviction regarding the database remained standing, but Valle was sentenced to time served and released.\\"NY policeman Gilberto Valle acquitted in cannibal plot\\" bbc.com. 1 July 2014. The government appealed the dismissal of the conspiracy charge to the Second Circuit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled on December 3, 2015, regarding the two questions on appeal: > The Government appeals from the district court's judgment of acquittal on > the conspiracy count, and Valle separately appeals from the judgment of > conviction on the CFAA count. Because we agree that there was insufficient > evidence as to the existence of a genuine agreement to kidnap and of Valle's > specific intent to commit a kidnapping, we affirm the district court's > judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count. Because we find that the > district court's construction of the CFAA violates the rule of lenity, we > reverse the judgment of conviction on the CFAA count.

It started as the result of two senior staff members being fired after forming an alliance and joining The Newspaper Guild. The strike halted production of the newspaper for the duration of the strike. The strike ended with a formal recognition of The Newspaper Guild. ==Background== The owner of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was William Randolph Hearst, who by the 1920s controlled newspapers that were read by a quarter of all Americans. He also owned an International News Service and six magazines including Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping. He later owned a television newsreel and film company and once considered running for the President of the United States. Hearst is credited as a founder of yellow journalism by utilizing sensationalism or crude exaggeration in his publications. The most famous example of Hearst's yellow journalism was prior to the Spanish–American War. He consistently published articles about ongoing conflicts between the Spanish and the Cuban Revolutionaries, often over- exaggerating events that transpired or fabricating events altogether, which was credited for laying the groundwork for the Spanish–American War by angering the American people. Hearst's \\"combat dispatches\\" turned out to be correspondents at luxury hotel resorts whose sources were their own imaginations. During World War I, the city of Seattle produced one-fifth of the United States wartime ship tonnage. A shipyard strike in 1919 brought national attention to Seattle when workers went on strike to keep their high wartime wages, which led to a general strike during February 6–10, the longest in American history. The strike fueled American fears of radical and socialist values, and gave Seattle a reputation of being at the heart of political radicalism. During the Great Depression, \\"Hoovervilles\\" started popping up around the city where nearly 1,000 unemployed residents would gather to stay in shacks at the empty shipyard south of Pioneer Square. World War II created an economic revival for companies like The Boeing Company, which increased employment by more than 1,200. The American Newspaper Guild was founded in 1933 and led by a columnist named Heywood Broun. It was founded because traditional independent editorial workers were upset with their pay. The Guild became affiliated with the American Federation of Labor in 1936 and the Congress of Industrial Unions in 1937, two of the largest labor organizations in America. ==Strike== In August 1936, thirty-five of the approximately seventy employees from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer went on strike. Employees who went on strike were members of the American Newspapers Guild. Management at the paper found that a few of the veteran members of their staff had joined the Newspaper Guild union and were fired as a result. The strike stopped publication of the newspaper from August 20 to November 29. Three members of the Newspaper Guild were among the most highly active during the strike: Everhardt Armstrong, Richard \\"Dick\\" Seller, and Frank Lynch. Armstrong gained a lot of hostility from management at the paper largely because he was a respected and experienced reporter who showed sympathy for causes of labor. Seller was a younger reporter who, shortly after getting married became reassigned to the \\"night police beat\\". This assignment was typically given to young and single reporters who were somewhat carefree. Seller joined the strike with the Newspaper Guild later and ended up becoming the president of the Guild's Seattle chapter. Lynch was the chief photographer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, whose department was seen as being disorganized and was fired once the management from the Hearst Corporation discovered he was a member of the American Newspaper Guild Union. David Beck was another key figure in the strike. Beck was an organizer for the Teamsters and had responsibilities all along the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, and later the entire West Coast. Strikers picketed outside the Seattle Post- Intelligencer and garnered attention from workers in the surrounding area. One group of those workers came from the waterfront and joined in the picket lines surrounding the building. Beck and the Teamsters then decided to refuse to drive past the picket lines, preventing the newspapers from being delivered. William Hearst became more willing to make a deal with the union strikers once the pro-labor Franklin D. Roosevelt won a landslide re-election as U.S. President on November 3. A tentative agreement was reached and the P-I employees returned to work. Shortly after the end of the strike, Hearst hired Roosevelt's son-in-law, John Boettiger, as the paper's publisher. David Beck was the person who brokered the deal between the two sides, as the most influential member of the Seattle Central Labor Council. This victory allowed Beck to increase his influence and to gain a strong reputation as Seattle's premier labor leader. Beck also used this to help him in becoming the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and to serve as chair of the UW Board of Regents. During the strike, the employees of the Post- Intelligencer printed a separate paper of their own, The Guild Daily. It came to print on August 14, 1936, and sold 20,000 copies on its first day. By the end of its run, it had more than 60,000 readers. The news it covered included the strike, world news, and local sports news. ==Impact== The 1936 strike against the Seattle P-I was the first time in Seattle history that a newspaper staff went on strike. This was the first successful strike for the Newspaper Guild and one of the first instances of white-collar workers holding a successful strike, while building a reputation that Washington State laborers had power. ==References== Category:1936 in Washington (state) Category:1936 labor disputes and strikes Category:Newspaper labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor disputes in Washington (state) ","title":"1936 Seattle Post-Intelligencer strike"},{"id":"46867529","text":"Khan Mohammad Moinuddin (30 October 193016 February 1981) was a Bangladeshi litterateur.

In addition to offering multi-temperature storage and packing services, Congebec also offer logistics and transportation services to its customers. ==History== Congebec was founded in 1974 by Laurier Pedneault following the acquisition of a warehouse on Dalhousie street, in close proximity to Quebec City's old port. In 1997 Congebec purchased its first warehouse in the Montreal region. In 2002, it was the first phase of construction for the Boucherville warehouse which was the beginning of a strong expansion for Congebec. In 2004, Congebec purchased the Centre Frigorifique Montérégie, which is now referred to as Sainte-Julie warehouse. In doing so, Congebec also purchased CFM logistics that now is Congebec's transport division. After the acquisition, Congebec became the largest refrigerated warehouse company in Quebec and second largest in Canada. In 2006, the Boucherville warehouse was considerably expanded. A seventh warehouse was built in Manseau in autumn 2008. This warehouse is almost entirely dedicated to the cranberry industry. In 2011, Congebec entered the Toronto market with the opening of an 8th refrigerated warehouse strategically located near Pearson Airport, with more than three million cubic feet. In 2013, Congebec conducted its largest expansion in history by acquiring four Westco Multitemp warehouses located in Calgary, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, which gave Congebec a total of more than 48.3 million cubic feet. In 2015, Capital régional et coopératif Desjardins (CRCD), a retail fund managed by Canadian private equity firm Desjardins Capital de risque, led an undisclosed investment in Congebec Logistic Inc. The deal was also backed by Fondaction CSN and Investissement Québec and supported the transfer of management of Congebec Logistic from its founder, Laurier Pedneault, to his son, Nicholas-P Pedneault. As a result of the transaction, CRCD, an existing investor in the company, became the majority shareholder. On April 25, 2017 Nick Pedneault was named Chairman of the WFLO (World Food Logistics Organisation) and said he would focus his efforts on the development and growth of the industry as well as on the promotion of the GCCA (Global Cold Chain Alliance). The WFLO represents the research and education component of the GCCA.

Since the party didn't exist before the Czech legislative election 2013, the then 8 parliament members from this party were officially called \\"Independents\\" until the 2017 Czech legislative election.

The party is opposed to Czech membership of the European Union and calls for the Czech Republic to leave the bloc. The party also wants to pursue a more restrictive immigration policy, particularly towards immigration from Islamic nations, and rejects multiculturalism. It is strongly opposed to illegal immigration and the EU's policy of migrant quotas which it argues will lead to the \\"Islamization\\" of Europe. However, the party maintains that it does not want to promote hatred to any nation, group or culture, but argues that Europe's Judeo-Christian identity should be protected. SPD also supports introducing a system of direct democracy and encouraging citizen participation in politics. It also wants to protect the right to privacy from state surveillance and supports a reduction in VAT tax. ==OrganisationMembership=== Tomio Okamura often claims that SPD has a membership of thousands of members. In October 2017 he claimed that SPD has 7,000 members, and in November 2017 12,000 members. Doubt has been cast on these figures, with the suggestion that Okamura often conflates numbers of supporters with actual members. It was reported in 2015 that SPD had only 20 members, compared to Okamura's claims of 10,000. The actual number of members is unknown. In February 2018 the party stated that it had 1,200 members. The party had 1,400 members in July 2018. ==Election resultsChamber of Deputies=== {  ! Year ! Vote ! Vote % ! Seats ! ± ! Place !

One of those resources, fish, has a lot of meaning to the working-class people of the area. The fishing industry is special in the fact that its successes and failures are directly connected to the natural cycle of the fish and the pressures that mass profiting can put on that cycle. With that being said, fishing is a much regulated industry. In the years after World War II the fishing industry employed between 33,000 and 50,000 fishers on 11,000 to 14,000 boats and these fishers sold their fish to 500 to 700 processors across the Pacific Northwest coast.Mann, Geoff. 2002. \\"Class Consciousness and Common Property: The International Fishermen and Allied Workers of America\\". International Labor and Working-Class History. 61. The fishermen's catch and distribution of the fish caught was concentrated in major ports that included cities such as San Francisco, Astoria, Seattle, and Bristol Bay (Alaska). As with many working class labor industries in the early half of the 20th century, the fishing industry was rife with labor unions. The International Fishermen and Allied Workers of America (IFAWA), a Pacific Coast trade union, was one of them. The IFAWA had a very short lived life, and is not well known, talked, or written about. The IFAWA came to be in May 1939 and consisted of six combined fishing unions, was affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and represented fishery workers in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. The union represented fishery workers from every part of the fishing process, from the fishermen catching the fish all the way to the workers that canned the fish in canneries. The decisions and rulings laid down from Office of Price Administration (OPA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), during and after World War II, had direct effect on the fishing industry in the Pacific Northwest and the IFAWA. The OPA had set price ceilings for fish caught during World War II and the FTC's anti- monopoly division concluded that the IFAWA was a group of businesspersons concluding to raise the prices of the fish that they sold. The IFAWA needed more power and backing to fight these rulings. With the IFAWA reaching over 22,000 members after World War II, they merged with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and became a division of the ILWU in January 1949. The merger made sense because of the fact that the ILWU and IFAWA were both based within the same ports and cities as each other. Joseph Jurich was made head of the fishermen's union of the IFAWA division within the ILWU, which was headed by Harry Bridges.\\"Jurich Again Made President By Fishermen.\\" The Seattle Times, January 29, 1949, Main sec. Accessed May 20, 2015. ==Tie-ups in 1949== The price that packers, or distributors, of fish were willing to pay to fishermen for catching them was at the forefront of the IFAWA's mind and decision making in every year. However, in 1949 the negotiations between the IFAWA and the packers reached a breaking point. This breaking point came to be in the Puget Sound area of Washington state. Strikes and 'tie-ups' would be littered throughout the entire year of 1949 in the area, and came during every fishing season that year.Baunach, Leo. \\"The International Fishermen and Allied Workers of America.\\" Waterfront Workers History Project. Accessed May 20, 2015. http://depts.washington.edu/dock/IFAWA_pt5.shtml. The negotiations between the packers and the IFAWA on the prices would happen before the season started and lasted until the IFAWA was satisfied with the offer. From March to June in 1949 the Puget Sound area fishermen and IFAWA decide to oppose the packers offer for what they would pay for herring. They never came to a full agreement on a price and only 125 out of 500 fishermen would contribute their services that year after a limited deal was reached in Alaska. These holdouts would continue throughout the year, as disagreement between the parties came at every new fishing season. The biggest of these would be during the salmon runs. During this time in 1949 there were two separate salmon fishing seasons, one from July to late September and another from October to November. In June and July the salmon fishermen, tendermen, and canners all elected to vote down offers from the packers. Bob Cummings, secretary of Local 3 of the IFAWA reported to the Seattle Times that the offer of 18 cents per pound for sockeye salmon and 8 cents for pink salmon from the Columbia Rivers Packers' Association was rejected; the fishermen wanted 30 cents, the same as the previous year, for sockeye and 16 cents for pinks, compared to 12 cents last year.\\"Union Rejects Puget Sound Salmon Offer.\\" The Seattle Times, June 24, 1949, Main sec. Accessed May 28, 2015. Also during July there was a tie-up, lasting 23 days, on the Columbia River and short strike by the Alaska Fishermen's Union, a member of the IFAWA, against the Alaskan Salmon Industry. ==All out Strike, 1949== The tie-ups and strikes carried over into the fall salmon runs in the Puget Sound area. The major strike came during October at 4 am on Wednesday October 5th, 1949 the IFAWA voted to go on strike against the packers, who were offering 8 cents per pound for dog salmon and 15 cents per pound for silvers, the IFAWA, according to Bob Cummings wanted 14 and 20 cents respectively.\\"Puget Sound Purse Seiners Go on Strike.\\" The Seattle Times, October 5, 1949, Main sec. Accessed May 24, 2015. The offer by the packers was a decrease of over 22% from the previous year and picket committees were formed in the cities of Seattle, Tacoma, Gig Harbor, Anacortes, Everett, and Bellingham. This was the first time the IFAWA had chosen to go on an all out strike. For the average wage earning fisherman the strike was difficult. The main point of the strike was for the average fishermen to earn a higher wage in the long-term, and they saw $50 fines for not participating in picket line duty. The average fisherman in 1949 made only a few thousand of dollars a year and made most of those dollars during only certain parts of the year, so when the IFAWA chose to go on strike they either had to join or get evicted from the union. Since the canneries were also a part of the IFAWA the fishermen with boats of their own could not even sell fish they caught during the strike because they were not running. The strike carried on however. On October 12, Bob Cummings reported to the Seattle Times that the IFAWA had rejected another offer from the packers but they were open to negotiations.\\"Purse Seiners Reject New Offer.\\" The Seattle Times, October 12, 1949, Main sec. Accessed May 24, 2015. There were many minor negotiations and disputes settled throughout October 1949, between packers and local fishermen of IFAWA in the Puget Sound but the strike carried on into the depths of fall. By the end of October and into late November, the end of the salmon runs, many of the major packers began to give in including the Whiz Fish Company, Washington Fish and Oyster Co., and Farwest. A pact was reach on October 27 according to the Seattle Times via Bob Cummings, and less the one third of the normal fishing fleet was dispatched to fish for the rest of the fishing season that ended on November 20.\\"Fresh-Fish Pact Reached.\\" The Seattle Times, October 27, 1949, Main sec. Accessed May 25, 2015. ==Aftermath== Overall the strike of 1949 in the Pacific Northwest was a success for the fishermen. The Local 3, a part of the IFAWA, in the Puget Sound was at the height of its membership at the time but overall after the strike the union was low on resources and combined with the ILWU. The imports of Canadian fishermen at this time were a big hit to the IFAWA and the packers now had more reasons to reject their offers in future years on prices for fish. The IFAWA was all but disbanded by 1957 and hardly anything has been heard of them since. The fishermen of the Puget Sound were fighting for a \\"living wage\\" and received it but it was lost in the wash with the combining of the ILWU and IFAWA, however the strike of 1949 deserves its place in history. ==References== Category:1949 in Washington (state) Category:1949 labor disputes and strikes Category:Maritime labor disputes in the United States Category:Puget Sound Category:Labor disputes in Washington (state) ","title":"Puget Sound fishermen's strike of 1949"},{"id":"46867568","text":"Cover of Abroad (1882) Embroidery design, 1878 Thomas Crane (1843–1903) was an English illustrator and art director at Marcus Ward & Co. known for his colourful children's books and decorative greeting cards which often incorporated floral motifs. ==Life== Crane was the eldest son of Thomas Crane (1808–1859), a painter and miniaturist known for his portraits of celebrated figures, and Marie Crane (née Kearsley), the daughter of a prosperous malt- maker. His father’s craft and skill influenced the younger Crane, as well as his younger brother Walter Crane, later to become one of the most influential children's illustrators of his generation. Crane was privately educated in Torquay, after which he was apprenticed to a lawyer, and later worked for several years at the General Post Office before devoting himself to a career in the arts. In the early 1860s and 1870s he designed cloth book-bindings for James Burn & Co. He later became the director of design at the London office of Marcus Ward & Co, where he designed the shopfront and supervised a large output of Christmas cards and books, some of which he also illustrated. During Crane's term as art director, Marcus Ward produced a number of celebrated works by Walter Crane and Kate Greenaway. The Christmas cards of Marcus Ward were well known for their quality, and during the 1800s were desirable among art collectors. Art critic Gleeson White attributed the popularity to Crane's design and supervision. White writes that Crane oversaw \\"a series of cards which–quite apart from the excellence of their pictures, or floral devices–were embellished by most refined and appropriate ornamentation on their borders and backs. The lettering was not left to chance, or reduced to the bare simplicity of a label in ordinary type... but was planned to accord with it. The colours which distinguish this class of decoration are unusually happy. Pale blue lettering on sage green ground, citrons, olives, and tertiary colours were employed much as they were used by the so-called aesthetic school of furnishers of the same period.\\" Crane was known for his ornamental work, which included floral designs and embellishments. With Ellen Elizabeth Houghton, a cousin, and John G. Sowerby, he produced a series of acclaimed picture books for children. Among the most celebrated, At Home (1881), Abroad (1882), and At Home Again (1883) were described by librarian scholar Roger Dixon as \\"among the loveliest books ever produced.\\" He was also among several artists, including William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, and Walter Crane, hired by the Royal School of Art Needlework to design patterns as part of a revival of art needlework or ornamental embroidery. He and his brother also contributed illustrations to a collection of lectures by their sister Lucy Crane, a writer and scholar of art. In later years he returned to landscape painting, and some of his landscape work was exhibited in the Royal Academy. After being afflicted by paralysis, Crane died on 27 May 1903 at the age of 59 and was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. ==Books== Publications designed by Crane, or including his illustrations, include: Marcus Ward & Co. *Art Embroidery: a Treatise on the Revived Practice of Decorative Needlework (1878) by Mary S.

The main overview of the events in Santa Clara was an agricultural strike by cherry pickers against the growers or employers. As the events of the labor strike unfolded, the significance of the strike itself grew beyond that of the workers themselves into a broader scope within America. ==Background== In the 1930s there was a vast amount of labor strikes that occurred within California specifically about agriculture known as the California Agricultural Strike 1933. The strikers were organized under the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (CAWIU), a labor organization affiliated with the Communist party. Many of the strikers/workers were of the minority background, such as Mexicans and Filipinos.Garden of the World: Asian Immigrants and the Making of Agriculture in California's Santa Clara Valley By Cecilia M. Tsu, Oxford University Press, USA, June 1, 2013 A primary reason for the strikes were that workers were demanding for increased wages as the standard wage of the average cherry picker was 20 cents per hour. Before the Santa Clara Cherry Strike, there were many previous strikes that occurred before the year 1933, such as the Santa Clara cannery strike in 1931. There was about a total of 40,000 California agricultural laborers that hit the picket line in 1933. ==Timeline== There were many strikes that began to occur within the year 1933. The CAWIU had been a major influence in mobilizing the California agricultural work force into strikes. 1933 was the year in which the United States held the most agricultural strikes, totaling at 61 strikes, with over half of them being in California. A reaction to the agricultural strikes within California was met received by the law enforcement as well as the press who took the side of the growers. Even though the initial group of agricultural strikes in April 1933 seemed to be successful, the growers began to recruit labor despite of the strikes, therefore the influence of power the strikers had begun to diminish. In mid June 1933, about 1000 cherry pickers on about 20 ranches struck for higher wages. Cherry growers had received economic losses in the previous years, thus led them to look for better prospects and to shut down any strikes. The pickers who joined the strike were met with opposition from the authorities armed with tear gas to suppress the workers. June 13–14, 1933; cherry pickers met with the CAWIU to organize a plan of action. The CAWIU's plans for a workers’ strike unless the growers agreed to increase their workers’ demands were met, including; wages increased to 30 cents per hour, eight-hour work days, and the recognition of labor unions. The response to the demands was mixed, as smaller farmers gave into pressure, while larger farmers did not recognize this. With the larger farms refusal of the workers’ demands, they began their strikes on June 14, 1933 with estimated 500 cherry pickers striking at the orchards. Picketers formulated a plan that they determined once the largest orchards were to give into the demands of the workers, the other orchards were to follow, thus the workers picketed at the large orchards.Bitter Harvest, a History of California Farmworkers, 1870-1941 By Cletus E. Daniel, University of California Press, 1982, pg. 150 June 16, 1933; the police arrested CAWIU organizer Patrick Callahan in the De Salvo orchard after the police in where he had received fractures in his skull and a broken jaw physically assaulted him. Callahan would be released two days later on bail and would return to the strike despite his current state.Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California By Kevin Star, Oxford University Press, January 11, 1996, pg. 74 June 18, 1933; there was about nearly 1000 cherry pickers on 20 ranches in total that joined the picket line. Many pickers joined due to the excessive force that local authorities which were intended to demoralize and prevent others from joining.Bitter Harvest, a History of California Farmworkers, 1870-1941 By Daniel, pg. 151; Garden of the World: Asian Immigrants and the Making of Agriculture in California's Santa Clara Valley By Tsu June 24, 1933; many of the major growers within California gave into the demands of the picketers, as the fear of losing their crops was apparent. Even though the most of the growers gave into the demands to raise the hourly wage of their workers from 20 cents per hour to 30 cents per hour, some continued to pay their workers at 20 cents. With the victory of the laborers over their employers, the CAWIU decided to end the workers’ walkout, but the employers still did not recognize them as a formal union. ==Aftermath== The Cherry picker strikers did succeed in their strike for higher wages. White residents within the Santa Clara Valley began to organize with the purpose of rooting out Radicalism. Began a movement of fighting against communism within California. Even though there were exclusions against Filipinos, the fears of labor strikes and spread of communism continued to prosper. One agricultural grower, Charles Derby, gathered a movement and organized the county in the creation of the Associated Farmers of California to combat communism and labor unionization. A significant importance to the results of the strike was that through the organization of all the laborers, this was a form of self-empowerment to a group that individually was powerless. The end result was the growers won against the strikers throughout the entire process.Company Unions, the Mexican Consulate, and the Imperial Valley Agricultural Strikes By Gilbert G. Gonzalez, The Western Historical Quarterly, 1996, pg. 54 After the strikes within the Santa Clara Valley in 1933, the CAWIU continued their campaign of gaining more membership within the union. Many of the union's membership consisted of workers that were Mexican, Anglo, Filipino, and black. Even after the massive strikes that were in 1933, the CAWIU would continue to organized agricultural labor and put start strikes in order to fulfill the workers’ demands of higher wages and better working conditions. These strikes received the same reciprocation as the Santa Clara Cherry Strikes, resistance.Company Unions, the Mexican Consulate, and the Imperial Valley Agricultural Strikes By Gonzalez, pg 62 ==Historical significance== The historical significance to the Santa Clara Cherry Strike was beyond that of just the individual workers, but was influenced by the government and the context of the time. While workers joined up with labor unions, specifically the CAWIU, in order to demand for better working conditions and wages; the state and federal government were fighting against them in order to rid the society of communist influence. Communism would become a major focus within American society within the same century especially during the Cold War. ==References== Category:1933 in California Category:History of Santa Clara, California Category:Labor disputes in California Category:1933 labor disputes and strikes Category:Agriculture and forestry labor disputes in the United States ","title":"Santa Clara cherry strike of 1933"},{"id":"46867602","text":"The Sanremo Music Festival 1997 was the 47th annual Sanremo Music Festival, held at the Teatro Ariston in Sanremo, province of Imperia, in the late February 1997 and broadcast by Rai 1.

It was primarily held by the pressmen, and supported by other unions such as the stereotypers. The pressmen union attempted to bring attention to conglomerate newspaper publishers' attempts at breaking up printing unions. ==Hearst takes over== William Randolph Hearst had opened up two newspapers in Chicago: an evening edition the Chicago American, and a morning edition the Chicago Examiner. Hearst Management had signed a joint contract for five years covering the printers, stereotypers, pressmen, engravers, and mailers. All but the pressmen were part of the International Typographical Union; the pressmen belonged to the International Printing Pressmen and Assistants' Union of North America. In 1905 Hearst Management renewed an agreement separately with each organization for another five years. In 1910 at the contract's expiration the pressmen and other printing trade unions were made aware that Hearst Management wanted to come under the agreement with the Chicago Chapter of the American Newspaper Publishers' Association (ANPA), because they more favored Management, but the pressmen resisted the notion of joining the ANPA ==Contract expires== In 1912 the Web Pressmen's Union No. 7 contractwith the Hearst papers expired, and they requested a wage increase. Hearst Management and the union could not come to an agreement, so they entered arbitration with the Chicago Board of Trade's president Harry Wheeler, which resulted in a reduction of wages by 20-30%, in order be more congruent with the prevailing wages of other Chicago newspapers. They also increased work hours, and Wheeler failed to give direction on the presses crew sizes, which allowed Hearst to downsize the press from ten men to eight men. This crew reduction was the direct cause of the strike. ==Strike or lockout?== On April 30, 1912 the Hearst management posted an announcement in their pressrooms that they had chosen to come under contract between the Web Pressmen's Union and the Chicago Chapter of the ANPA. At the direction of union leadership, the pressmen continued to work. On May 1 Hearst Management posted that the contract would now reduce the men on the press from ten to eight men without having this approved by neither the union nor its members. At this announcement the men refused to work and walkout. Hearst Management stood by their contracts, and contended the pressmen broke their contracts by working the night, and then walking out in the morning. Instead, they urged the pressmen to file a formal complaint through an arbitration process. George L. Berry, the president of the International Printing Pressmen and Assistants' Union came to Chicago to lead the pressmen strike and encouraged other unions to join. A dispute arose between Berry and Hearst Management as to whether this was to be a strike or a lockout. Hearst stood behind the contract that stated, \\"The employer shall in each case determine the number of men to be employed,\\" where Berry argued that the rest of the clause stated that \\"each decision shall be open to question by the union should he hereafter reduce the number below that he now employs on the press without at the same time adopting some additional labor-saving devices, attachment or improvement.\\"Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity.\\" P.103; \\"Chicago Newspapers Tied Up By Strikers,\\" The New York Times, May 3, 1912. ==Joining the strike== The Chicago Newspapers stood with Hearst and locked pressmen out. Only the Scripps-McRae Day Book and the socialist newspapers kept their contracts with the pressmen. Web Pressmen Union No.7 were locked out, and also stripped of the bargaining rights with Chicago publishers. On May 3, 1912 the Stereotypers' Union No.4, The Delivery and Mail Drivers' Union, and the Newsboys Union joined the walkout.Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" P.104 The International Stereotypers' and Electrotypers' Union of North America did not sanction the strike and ordered the local Chicago Stereotypers' Union No. 4 back to work while Union No.4 did not want to work with scabs or under police protection. The Typographical Union No. 16 where pressured into joining the strike, and put it to a vote on May 19, 1912, but voted to remain on the job and honor their existing contracts.\\"Chicago Union Printers Decline to Join Strike,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 13, 1912 Berry saw that as a blow to side with the publishers that \\"are bending every means to disrupt the organizations they have locked out.\\" Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" P. 109 The Chicago Federation of Labor stood behind the pressmen strike and on June 2, 1912 they called out Union No. 16 for staying on the job.Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" p.110 The publishers continued to stand behind Hearst and placed the blame on the pressmen for breaking their contracts and not using the proper recourses for challenging the contract.

Both local and national officers were in attendance including John Fitzpatrick, president of Chicago Federation of Labor. Berry presented the pressmen's' grievances, and the typographical union defended their stance in not joining the strike. Gompers met with the publishers in order to start negotiations of the strike but the publishers would not deal with the pressmen.Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" p.113 Berry attempted to widen the strike but was rejected.Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" p.116 Also the conditions of New York would not allow for a strike, even though they would want that strike to \\"force a settlement in Chicago\\".Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" p.116 At the convention Berry was warned about extending the strike to all Hearst papers, because they would not be able to hold out against Hearst.Philip Taft. \\"The Limits of Labor Unity,\\" p.117 The AFL called for an end to the pressmen strike and once again attempted to negotiate with the publishers which they declined.

The strike, organised by the newly formed Deep Sea Fishermen's Union, lasted three months. The issues causing the strike were working conditions, wages, and regulation of catches and prices, and by the terms on which it was settled the strikers achieved some of their aims. ==Background== The Port of Seattle came into existence on September 5, 1911, by a vote of the people of the Port District. One of the biggest factors that swayed the votes in favor of creating the port was the prospect of economic growth.Oldham Kit. \\"Port of Seattle’s Commissioners Meet for the First Time September 12, 1911\\". Historylink.org essay 9726. February 16, 2011. However, port construction did not begin until 1913 with the creation of a home port for the local fishermen. This terminal was completed in 1914 and became the Northern Pacific Fishing Fleet's home of operations. In the meantime, against a background of political and economic change throughout Seattle, in November 1912 all halibut fishermen sailing out of the Seattle-Tacoma port went on strike. ==Deep Sea Fishermen’s Union== It was during this time that the Deep Sea Fishermen's Union (DSFU) was created by three steamship fishermen based at the port of Seattle. This union was formed based on the tough working conditions in the industry, including harsh weather conditions, unsafe working conditions, and long distance traveling. These aspects led to strikes by fishermen throughout the Seattle port, which were typically run by the Seattle Deep Sea Fishing Union members. However, crewmen as well as fishermen participated in this specific strike. The Deep Sea Fishing Union is one of the small number of United States unions that support crewmen as well as fishermen. Its existence led to the formation of the Fishing Vessel Owners Association. This association has experienced many strikes against boat owners and other agencies.Raskin Hanna. \\"Happy Birthday, Deep Sea Fishermen’s Union\\". Seattle News Weekly. February 14, 2012. ==The strike== The striking fishermen and crewmen demanded higher wages, better working conditions, and an increase in the price of halibut from one cent per pound to one and a half cents per pound.Lamborn Frank. Second Annual Report of the Industrial insurance department. For the 12 months ending September 30th 1913. Olympia Public Printers. 1913. The strike lasted from November 1912 until February 13, 1913 and caused a decline in fish harvest and consumption as well as impacting the economy of the port and further afield. ==Settlement== Eventually the Deep Sea Fishermen's Union and Seattle's port commissioners came to a compromise, by which the Union fishermen returned to work under the condition that halibut prices increase to one and a quarter cents per pound, close to their original request of one and a half cents per pound.Burk, Padraic. \\"Struggle for Public Ownership: The early history of the port of Seattle\\". The Pacific Northwest Quarterly. Vol 68 No 2 (April 1977) pg 60-71. The Deep Sea Fishermen's Union also took control of catch limits, thereby influencing prices. International fishing boundaries were re- established and bottom trawlers, which were affecting fish abundance, were banned. These measures meant that fishermen and crewmen would no longer need to travel such long distances in order to reach their quota. Currently the Deep Sea Fishermen's Union continues to represent fishermen and crewmen throughout the Pacific Northwest at the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council meetings, as well as other fisheries regulation meetings.Washington State Bureau of Labor, Ninth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Factory Inspection. 1913-1914 (Olympia Frank M Lamborn Public Printer, 1914). Its members are prepared to strike over any uncertainty or inequality regarding fishermen and crewmen within the fishing industry. The Halibut strike of 1912 is only one of many limited-scale strikes that have taken place within the Port of Seattle. ==See also== * Halibut Treaty ==Footnotes== Category:1912 in Washington (state) Category:1912 labor disputes and strikes Category:Maritime labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor disputes in Washington (state) Fishermen halibut strike of 1912 ","title":"Seattle Fishermen halibut strike of 1912"},{"id":"46867707","text":"Tantaliana crepax is a moth in the family Eupterotidae.

President of the ILWU (International Longshore and Warehouse Unions) at the time was Harry Bridges. The WEA (waterfront employers association) led by Frank P. Foise were in a conflict, they were unable to come to agreeable terms and with the issues of hiring and the politics of union leadership, longshoremen and marine unions performed a walk out on September 2, 1948. The strike shut down the United States’ West Coast ports and put a dent in American labor history and a positive change for future longshoremen. ==Background== \\"The ILWU is about workers who built a union that is democratic, militant and dedicated to the idea that solidarity with other workers and other unions is the key to achieving economic security and a more peaceful world.\\" In the sense that the workers wanted to achieve a better life for themselves and their families. The conditions of this job are unsafe and “on call”. The work of loading and unloading ships’ cargoes was, at times, very random and unscheduled. The employers were demanding change in order to keep up with the demands of war effort. With the history of this type of work as well with their democratic point of view, conservative and hardworking, any negative changes are nearly impossible to make especially in a time of radical reformation. The 1948 Seattle Pacific Longshore Strike was a conflict between the changes from the New Deal and the prestages of the Cold War. During World War II many divisions splitting up the ILWU began. WEA during the 1948 strike attempted to manipulate these sections, the outcome would then weaken the union's solidarity. With the outbreak of the war this put the ILWU in a strange position there was a pressure on the Union to increase production for the sake of the war effort. The demand for soldiers and the need for stability had a huge impact of the ILWU. This was a ninety-five-day strike that stretched from San Diego to Alaska. The outburst of this strike emerged shortly after the Taft-Hartley Act. This was taking place during the time of The Red Scare. The 1948 strike secured the future for the ILWU, in the sense that it would survive the Cold War anti-labor persecutions that diminished most leftwing unions. With the two leaders unable to come to terms, the strike lasted more than three months during which “union members displayed an intensity of purpose and level of solidarity that defied the expectations of employers and many observers” With the stress of World War II and the Cold War, along with Conflict arising between WEA and ILWU led to the Longshoreman strike of 1948.http://depts.washington.edu/dock/1948strike.shtml ==Strike Timeline== The outbreak of this strike goes back to the start of “Fink Hall” an open shop hiring system, which originated in Seattle, under the leadership of Frank P. Foisie. This system changed the history of how a longshoreman found work, the employers were now in charge as to who gets hired and for how much. Many conflicts arose from this new type of hiring system such as bribes were initiated to obtain work. Many known union supporters were blacklisted and unable to get a job. This decreased the rotation work allowing those in favor to find work while others will go days and days without work and pay. The objective of the 1948 strike was to illuminate the control of the employers, and to end favoritism, allow opportunity for all and continue to work in a secure position. The two building blocks that provide the strength for the ILWU's Longshore Division have always been the hiring hall and the coastwise contract. After the strike of 1937 the West Coast longshoremen won the coast contract. This new contract made many improvements in the working lives of many longshore men and their families, and the strength and solidarity necessary to improve wages and benefits for generations to come. After the strike of 1934 the union gained major concessions from employers. The strike of 1948 was significant in the sense that it created the union control over the hiring hall, which would give workers job security and more control which allowed fairness for all. This strike did not appear out of nowhere changes within the labor movement and a political shift gave leeway to the WEA to take a more aggressive approach against the hiring hall with the involvement of a radical leader of the ILWU. The President at the time, Truman, initiated the Taft-Hartley Law to deprive the ILWU of all of its gains. This act “outlawed the hiring hall, preferential hiring for union members, secondary boycotts, and strikes over jurisdictional issues.” During the political shift the Republican Party began to win both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Their Republican- controlled Congress were the ones who passed this Act, this law made it harder for unions to form, thus changing the outlook of labor. This law was put in place because a strike was on the radar and was going to happen if Truman didn't take action. Unfortunately this Law was unsuccessful and the strike went on creating a “New look”. September was the specific time that the Longshoremen walked off the job on the Puget sound of Seattle. Bringing forth hostility and the rise of the strike Seattle post-Intelligence, Sept. 2nd, 1948 ==Aftermath== The Strike of 1948 gave a “new look” to the longshoremen workers. One of the finest trade union agreements ever made was negotiated in the new atmosphere. The hiring hall continued as it was; wages were increased, union security was reaffirmed and improvements were made in the hours and vacations provisions. This was the last time the coast wise contract was challenged by employers. https://www.ilwu.org/history/the-ilwu-story/ ==Further reading== The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History by Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, Immanel Ness Los Angeles Times, Monday, Aug.23,1948 Seattle Post- Intelligencer, Thursday, Sept. 2, 1948 ==References== Category:1948 labor disputes and strikes ","title":"Longshore strike 1948"},{"id":"46867767","text":"Ava Alam (1947–1976) was a Bangladeshi classical singer and music teacher.

April 2010 For a long time the Belgian-French director duo worked exclusively in France and the French part of Switzerland with occasional productions at the Spoleto Festival USA in South Carolina and at the Welsh National Opera. In 1999, they directed A Midsummer Night's Dream together at Opera North in Leeds. This was followed in 2001 by an invitation to the Royal Opera House in London, where Leiser/Caurier are still involved. In 2008, the Zurich artistic director at the time, Alexander Pereira finally engaged the directing duo for the first time in German-speaking territory. In Zurich, the two directors worked closely and productively with Cecilia Bartoli. In 2012 Bartoli and Pereira - both now in management positions in Salzburg - brought the two directors to the Salzburg Whitsun Festival. A few months later the Bregenz Festival followed, and in 2013 the Theater an der Wien and then the Vienna State Opera.

In 1945 president of the company Philip G. Johnson died and William McPherson Allen took his place. In 1945, after World War II, the market for wartime planes dwindled. The president William McPherson Allen decided to temporarily shut down the activities and to lay off 25,000 workers.Ingham, J. (1983). Biographical dictionary of American business leaders (Vol. 1, p. 2026). To save the company, Allen announced that he was going to start making commercial planes. In October 1946, Boeing declared that the contract between the company and the Union was up for renewal. Boeing and the Union reached an agreement to start negotiating the new contract starting January 1947.174 F.2d 988; 85 U.S. App. D.C. 116; 1949 U.S. App. LEXIS 3461; 24 L.R.R.M. 2101; 16 Lab. Cas. (CCH) ¶ 65,164. Between January and April 1947 both parties met regularly three times a week to discuss the contract. During this time neither party was able to reach an agreement. In April the Union gave Secretary of Labor and to the National Labor Relations Board a notice for intention to strike. After the intention was submitted the Union and Boeing tried to talk about the contract but “there remained unsettled questions of Seniority, Hours of Labor, and Wages.” After filing to strike and receiving approval the members of the Union never did so. The Union then drafted a proposal that discussed the issues the employees were worried about which was seniority, hours of labor, and wages. The condition was that the proposal had to be accepted by Boeing on April 21, 1948, before noon otherwise the proposal would be void. If this happened Lodge 751 stated that they “reserve the right to take appropriate action including a work stoppage.” Boeing rejected the offer on April 21, 1948. The next day the Union went on strike. ==Strike timeline== * 1938: “Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge No. 751 was certified by the Board as the bargaining agent of the production and maintenance employees.”217 F.2d 369; 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 3835; 34 L.R.R.M. 2821; 26 Lab.

The Taft-Harley Act has many components to it, but the one most vital to this strike is it “made illegal were secondary strikes, secondary boycotts, and sympathy strikes, which were designed to influence employers other than those with whom the union had a contract.”Reese, H., \\"Taft-Hartley Act.\\" Dictionary of American History. 2003, \\"Taft-Hartley Act.\\" West's Encyclopedia of American Law. 2005, \\"Taft-Hartley Labor Act.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.. 2014, & \\"Taft-Hartley Act.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. (2004).

After not being able to reach an agreement with the company the Union declared a strike. * September 13, 1948: The Union members that were a part of Lodge 751 reluctantly went back to work. Lodge 751 “represents many men and women throughout Eastern Washington, Oregon and Idaho at various companies in trades such as aluminum workers, metal trades, Transit, delivery, regional disposal workers, workers at Grand Coulee Dam, auto mechanics, heavy duty mechanics, machinists, welder fabricators, refrigerator repairmen, building maintenance, irrigation workers and many others.” * February 25, 1949: BOEING AIRPLANE CO. et al. v.

This court case is address the fact that Lodge 751 broke the contract of not giving notice before going on strike. The verdict was when Boeing gave a letter to Lodge 751 that said “The strike which began last night and which is now continuing at the Seattle plants of the Company and which the union caused and sanctioned is in direct violation and repudiation of the collective Bargaining Agreement dated January 5, 1944, as amended March 16, 1946, between Boeing Aircraft Company and Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge 751 and International Association of Machinists.” 1\\\\. 91 F.

AERONAUTICAL INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT LODGE NO. 751, INTERNATIONAL ASS'N OF MACHINISTS, et al. “The power of termination which accrues to the wronged party as a result of such a breach and was exercised by Boeing in this case is a right of rescission which leaves neither party with any basis thereafter to complain of the conduct of the other as a breach of the contract.” What this means is that the Union was not exactly guilty of going on strike since at that point in time there was no contract between Lodge 751 and Boeing. * March 27, 1951: BOEING AIRPLANE CO. v.

Naylor CitationEncyclopedia of African History: A - G.. 1 CitationNorth Africa, Revised Edition: A History from Antiquity to the Present - Phillip C. Naylor Citation == The expedition == The French expeditionary force amounting to 8,040 men commanded by Clauzel, left Bône on November 13; on the 18th, it crossed the pass of Râs-el-Akba and was only two marches from Constantine. After an encampment at Raz-Oued-Zenati, the French army endured difficult climatic conditions. The army had reached very high areas; during the night rain, snow and hail fell with such abundance and continuity that the soldiers, in the bivouac, were exposed to all the rigors of a Russian winter; the land, completely broken up, recalled the mud of Poland. The army marched further on the 20th, and arrived, with the exception of the baggage and a rear guard, at Constantine, where it was forced to stop. The cold was excessive. Several men had their feet frozen; others perished during the night, because since in Raz-el-Akba there was not enough wood to start a fire. Finally, the reinforcements, thanks to which the teams were doubled and tripled, having joined the army, the French army crossed the Bou-Merzoug, one of the tribes of the Wadi Rhummel, on the 21st, and took up position under the walls of Constantine. The city was defended by nature itself: a ravine 60 meters wide, immense depth, and at the bottom of which flows the Rhummel wadi, presents for escarp and counterscarp a sheer-cut rock, unassailable by mine as by the ball. The Mansourah plateau was connected to the city by a very narrow bridge leading to a very strong double door, well defended by the musketry fires of the houses and gardens which surround it. == The Siege == Marshal Clauzel occupied the plateau of Mansourah with the Duke of Nemours and the troops of General Trézel; General de Rigny was ordered to seize the hills of Koudiat- Aty, to pacify the marabouts and the cemeteries in front of the Ez-Rabahah gate and to block this gate. However, it was impossible for the French army to lead on this point, as the field artillery, was not yet ready. Ahmed Bey shut himself up in Constantine, while he entrusted its defense to his general (Khalifa) Ben Aïssa, who has recruited about 1,500 Berbers, Chaouis, Kabyles, and Arabs, all of whom were determined to defend the city from French colonialism. The French avant-garde brigade moved to the heights where resistance was successfully defeated. The marshal directed artillery fire against the El-Cantara gate. On the 22nd, this brigade fought against the Muslims who came out through doors that the French army could not block, since it had only 3,000 men around it. The weather continued to be dreadful: the snow was falling in large flakes, the wind was freezing and finally ammunition and food were exhausted. On the 23rd, a new attack against the French who were repulsed. Two simultaneous attacks on the French, on the night of 23-24, were semi-successful, as many French soldiers were put out of action, either killed, wounded, or captured. == French Retreat == On the 24th, the marshal ordered the retreat. This first day was very difficult; the entire garrison and a multitude of cavalry attacked the rear guard fiercely, including Commander Changarnier, of the 2nd light infrantry. Surrounded by enemies, he formed his battalion in a square and, at the moment of a terrible attack, opened a fire of two ranks at close range, which covered three sides of the square with men and horses.

The Hundertwasser Wairau Maori Arts Centre is a proposed art and cultural centre in Whangarei, New Zealand. The project plans to convert the former Northland Harbour Board building in the Whangarei Town Basin into an arts centre based on a design by the late Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, with the support of the Hundertwasser Foundation. The original design was mooted in 1993 when mayor of Whangarei invited Hundertwasser to design a new arts centre. The project has proved controversial and was considered and rejected a number of times until it was eventually approved by a binding referendum in June 2015. Construction began in June 2018, and should be complete by the end of 2020. ==History== In 1993 the Austrian artist-architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser designed an art centre for Whangarei. The building was not built and in May–June 2015 a referendum was held to determine whether to go ahead. Options presented were to build a Hundertwasser Wairau Maori Art Centre in the former Northland Harbour Board building, or a maritime museum, or to demolish the building. Prime Minister John Key supported the project and indicated he thought Tourism New Zealand should assist with funding. (He was tourism minister at the time.) A majority voted for the Hunterwasser proposal in the referendum, according to the preliminary result announced after voting closed on 5 June. The local Northern Advocate newspaper reported there were 13,726 votes for the Hunterwasser proposal, 7,876 votes to demolish the building, and 5,478 votes for a maritime museum. The council did not build an arts centre when it was first drawn because Hundertwasser selected a building owned by Northland Regional Council who did not wish to sell it to the Whangarei District Council. Hundertwasser then went on to design the Hundertwasser Toilets for nearby Kawakawa which have become the major attraction for Kawakawa and are credited with providing the impetus for Kawakawa's economic recovery. After his death the Whangarei District Council revived plans to build the Hundertwasser Arts Centre and in 2012 signed a contract with Hundertwasser Non Profit Foundation to build it and to display authentic Hundertwasser work and contermporary Maori artwork there. The Hundertwasser Non Profit Foundation acknowledge this as the last authentic Hundertwasser building provided it is built on the building he selected. This project was costed, consented, agreed and included in the Long Term Council Plan. The cost to the council was to be $8 million including earthquake strengthening for the building. 220,000 visitors a year were expected. A feasibility study by Deloittes assessed the economic benefit to Northland as $3.5 million per year. The Yes Whangarei campaign estimated the effective cost per household via rates to be $6.70 per year over 10 years. This per-household cost excluded the earthquake strengthening on the assumption it would be required regardless. The deputy Mayor, Phil Halse, said \\"Hundertwasser's legacy would put Whangarei on the map - not just in New Zealand but globally\\" whereas in Wellington the Wellington Regional Strategy study (2005) noted that Wellington had missed an opportunity to do just that for Wellington by not choosing the Hundertwasser and Gehry proposal for Te Papa. The project was controversial, with concerns about ratepayer cost and some people not liking the appearance. In May the results of a phone survey commissioned by the council were released. The survey only polled land lines provided by WDC, because mobile phone data was not available. Only 78% of Whangarei households have landlines. In the weighted results 53% of residents opposed the HAC project whereas 28% supported it. The primary reason for opposing the project was cost with 81% saying \\"rate payer money should be spent on other priorities\\" or \\"Too expensive / waste of money\\". The primacy of the cost concern was demonstrated by the question \\"What proportion of the construction costs would you be comfortable with Council contributing\\". 53% of respondents were comfortable with the council contributing 20% of the costs whereas only 28% were comfortable with the council paying 40% or more of the costs. Some criticism has been made of the survey. 41% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about the project and there is no reporting as to how people who knew about the project responded as opposed to those who didn't. The under- representation of people under 40 (only 95 people surveyed with only 30 of those saying they knew about the project) affects the reliability. Tony Collins concludes \\"so, really the only thing you can say with confidence from this research is that older people don’t support the Centre\\". In June 2014 Councillor Phil Halse moved a motion to remove the HAC from the Long Term plan citing procedural issues. This was narrowly passed leading to one national newspaper running the headline 'Whangarei kills reason to visit'. Following the decision the council building council staff reported \\"\\"Feedback from the investment and development community has been that confidence was somewhat dampened by the Hundertwasser decision\\"\\" Many commenters and some councillors have stated the public voted against the Hundertwasser but there has not been a public vote on the issue (although there was a phone poll). The Yes Whangarei online petition has been signed by over 3000 people (compared to 24,167 ratepayers who voted for the current councillors ) but not all petition signers are ratepayers and it cannot be considered a vote. Several of the councillors who voted against the HAC had supported it in the past (including Phil Halse) or had not stated their position prior to the election (including Susy Bretherton ) so the council election cannot be considered to be a vote either. Phil Halse has been accused of changing his position due to 'petty politics and sour grapes' over not being appointed deputy mayor but claims his reasoning is all about process. Whangarei voting numbers for local councillors are fairly small meaning that only one councillor (the mayor) was elected with more votes than the number of people who have signed the petition Following this vote the council asked for further proposals to make that location iconic. The four proposals selected for further consideration included a revised proposal for the Hundertwasser Arts Centre (renamed Hundertwasser Wairau Maori Art Centre) by a newly formed trust called Prosper Northland. The proposal was backed up by a new feasibility study which affirmed the original Deloitte's study and said it was based on conservative figures. One of the other proposals withdrew in support of the HWMAC proposal leaving a short-list of three. Under the new proposal Prosper Northland commit to finding all funding except for the earthquake strengthening. Whangarei District Council staff analysis states that \\"Overall staff considers the HWMAC proposal to be about economic development while on balance the other three are more about enhancing Sense of Place and telling our story\\". A public meeting to present the HWMAC proposal was attended by over 1000 supporters Five councillors who voted against the more expensive HAC proposal moved to reject the HWMAC proposal. The motion was voted rejected at an extraordinary meeting of the Whangarei District Council on 12 November 2014 with only five councillors voting in favour. A counter motion by the major to proceed with the HMWAC proposal AND the Harbourside proposal with a goal to have both was also rejected. A final motion was passed that a binding referendum should be held in March. This was passed. The New Zealand Herald stated \\"Last week it was decided, reluctantly, to hold a referendum on the proposal. To scrap the plan would be a loss not just for those supporting it now but for generations to come. At present there is no reason whatsoever for visitors to stop in Whangarei. With the Hundertwasser Arts Centre, there would be\\" Phil Halse advised the Northern Advocate that the up-front cost would be $4.7 million. This conflicts with council staff analysis that puts the 5 year cost at $2.8 million and the figure stated by fellow anti-Hundertwasser councillor Trisha Cutforth in the council meeting and was disputed in the same article by Barry Trass of Prosper Northland. In response to claims by Phil Halse that there would be additional costs and that the council would incur costs after the first 4 years Prosper Northland have formally advised the council they are able to extend the period for which they underwrite the Art Centre from 4 years to ten years. The referendum on 5 June returned a majority vote for the Hundertwasser building. The HWMAC received 51% of the vote, with the demolition option receiving 29% and 20% voting for the Harbourside option. Some local media have called it a landslide victory. Voter turnout was 49%, which is comparable to voter turnout of 48% at the last local body election in Whangarei ==References== Category:Proposed buildings and structures in New Zealand Category:Whangārei ","title":"Hundertwasser Arts Centre"},{"id":"46867918","text":"The New York Shipbuilding Company's Camden, New Jersey facility operating at capacity due to World War I. The New York Shipbuilding strike was a strike that occurred in the Port of Camden, New Jersey, in the spring of 1934 by the New York Shipbuilding Company. Around 3,100 men took part in the 7-week action, centered at the company's Camden, New Jersey construction yard. A second and longer strike of the company occurred in the spring and summer 1935, which required intervention from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to force a settlement. ==Company history== The New York Shipbuilding Company was established by Henry G. Morse in 1900. Though original plans were to site the works on Staten Island in New York State, the final site was based in Camden, New Jersey. By 1914, the company was the leader in naval production and by 1917 it was the largest shipyard in the world. In total, the company made over 670 merchant and warships, producing 30% of the US Navy's battleships by 1921. The company's ownership changed hands several times due to financial instability after World War I. ==1934 strike== The strike occurred during construction of the Heavy cruiser USS Tuscaloosa. By the summer of 1933, wages and conditions in the port were considered unsatisfactory due to the increased cost of living and lack of support by the American Federation of Labor. The Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America offered assistance, being organized by local left-wing and social workers in the area. By 1934, it had expanded and represented a quarter of a million members. The workers went on strike on March 27, 1934, demanding an increase in wages and fewer working hours. Around 3,100 men took part in the action. Union members asked for \\"abolition of piecework and elimination of the company union with consequent enrollment of its members in the industrial union.\\" This delayed work of $40,000,000 worth of ships. The \\"first-class\\" mechanics were currently making $23.20 for a 32-hour work week. The union asked for an increase of $1 an hour for a 32-hour week for these mechanics, and increased wages for other job categories in the company as well. On April 13, the New York Shipbuilding Company said it was officially closing down. Company president, Clinton L. Bardo, offered a 10% pay raise to the workers. The wage increase was finally negotiated on May 13. The workers and union members were originally asking for 37.5%, but instead compromised on 14.6% after the Navy threatened to move construction of the cruiser Tuscaloosa to another Navy Yard. The company insisted they would not discriminate over rehiring workers, and increased working hours from 32 to 36 hours a week. The skilled mechanics received the highest wage increase, which was 16.5%. 1,300 workers’ wages increased from 61–71 cents an hour to 70–83 cents an hour. On May 15, over 3,000 returned to work in Camden. The strike lasted for a total of seven weeks and stopped the production of many naval vessels, tankers and other ships. About 900 new men applied for a job at the shipyard, in order to participate in a new naval construction program. The union officers held a parade to celebrate the end of the strike. The company resumed work, completing work on the Tuscaloosa, including a test run. ==1935 strike== The Camden workers claimed that the company violated the strike agreement that was signed on May 12. In July, over 1,000 employees took part in a meeting at the Convention Hall. The union's executive secretary, John Green, was elected to go to Washington to ask for an inquiry, after the company failed to \\"give a week’s notice with pay on dismissal, failure to pay agreed rates to third-class helpers, and refusal to nominate its members to the board of arbitration.\\" John Green said that the company was laying workers off instead of hiring them, as originally stated. The company did not want to re-open negotiations, so a second strike was held between March and August 1935. Employees had had support from the United Mine Workers, ACW and AFL. The Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, investigated the background to the strike, reporting findings directly to the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt, a former Secretary of the Navy, demanded that management negotiate with the union, threatening that otherwise the company would lose all US Naval contracts. This strike lasted for 11 weeks, surpassing the previous seven-week strike back in 1934. The company closed down in the mid 1960s due to low shipbuilding demand. ==Further reading== * Walters, William D., Jr. American Naval Shipbuilding, 1890–1989. 3rd ed. Vol. 90.

Gray, Tektronix, Inc.\\" Alappat, 33 F.3d at 1529. \\"Alappat, Edward E. Averill, and James G. Larsen were employees of Tektronix, Inc. of Wilsonville, Oregon, a manufacturer of electronic test equipment and computer-related equipment.\\" W. Wayt King, Jr., The Soul of the Virtual Machine: In Re Alappat, 2 575, 594 (1995). See also Information Law Alert (Sept. 9, 1994), quoting Tektronix in-house lawyer explaining why Tektronix brought the case as a test case to establish the patentability of \\"digital circuitry governed by mathematical formulas.\\" He and two other employees (Edward Averill and James Larsen, but for convenience the three will be referred to collectively as Alappat) devised a form of \\"rasterizer,\\" which is a device used in a digital oscilloscope to smooth waveform data before displaying the waveform on the oscilloscope screen.Rasterisation. (The irregularities in the waveform are called \\"jaggies.\\") The invention is a system for improving the appearance of digital oscilloscopes' screen displays by connecting data points smoothly without gaps or jaggies. A digital oscilloscope ordinarily represents data points as isolated points on the screen. Each point occupies a small area on the screen termed a \\"pixel.\\" It is convenient to connect successive data points on the screen by a line, so that the data appears on the screen as a line graph.See 33 F.3d at 1537. The Federal Circuit said: \\"Employing this anti-aliasing technique eliminates any apparent discontinuity, jaggedness, or oscillation in the waveform, thus giving the visual appearance of a smooth continuous waveform. In short, and in lay terms, the invention is an improvement in an oscilloscope comparable to a TV having a clearer picture.\\" Id. See also 33 F.3d at 1538: \\"Without the benefit of Alappat's anti-aliasing system, points 54 and 52 would appear on the screen as separate, unconnected spots. In Alappat's system, the different intensity level at which each of the pixels is illuminated produces the appearance of the line 48, a so-called vector.\\" There were two problems, however, with these displays. First, the jaggies would create a \\"staircase effect.\\" Second, random noise superimposed on the signal makes the lines appear to flicker and move up and down or from side to side (which is called \\"aliasing\\"). The basic technique to overcome aliasing (\\"anti-aliasing\\") generally in use was to lessen the illumination intensity of those pixels more remote from the desired trajectory of the data points, in accordance with some formula or scheme (for example, least squares averaging). Conventional means were well known for varying the amount of energy delivered to the location of a pixel, in order to vary light intensity at the pixel. In a cathode-ray tube (CRT), such as that for an oscilloscope, a beam of electrons is accelerated by an electromagnet coil around the neck of the tube. The electrons' speed (and therefore energy, and therefore illuminating effect) is proportional to the current in the coil at the time the electrons pass through it.The technology is discussed in the article Cathode ray tube. An alternative expedient to the electromagnetic deflection of electrons described in the text is electrostatic deflection, using deflection plates. Hence, to implement an anti-aliasing scheme one controls pixel intensity by varying CRT neck coil current in accordance with the scheme. The result is to provide variable illumination intensity for each pixel, so that the pixels closest to the trajectory of the data points on the screen are made brighter, and those farther away, dimmer. The procedure improves the appearance of the display by providing a continuous-appearing and non-jumping waveform.See John E. McGlynn, Patent Law - Patentable Subject Matter and Computer Software Inventions - In re Alappat, 14 135, 138 (1995). Alappat devised what appears to be a novel and convenient anti-aliasing scheme—an anti-aliasing algorithm. The specification of the patent application disclosed how to provide a smooth-appearing waveform (something appearing to be a straight diagonal line without jaggies or staircase) by determining illumination intensity of each of the pixels in accordance with the new formula I' = c (1 - [Δy ij / Δy i ]). In this formula, c is an arbitrary constant, and the Δ values represent vertical pixel-to-pixel distances on the screen. A user of the system then makes the CRT's neck coil current proportional to I', as calculated according to the foregoing formula. The PTO did not assert that the technology described above is the kind of thing with which the patent laws are concerned, but instead argued that what was claimed was different from that and was not patentable subject matter, because giving the claim its \\"broadest reasonable interpretation,\\" and because it was drafted entirely in means-plus-function format, \\"each of the steps in this postulated process claim recites a mathematical operation, which steps combine to form a 'mathematical algorithm for computing pixel information,' and that, 'when the claim is viewed without the steps of this mathematical algorithm, no other elements or steps are found.\\"33 F.3d at 1539-40. In other words, Alappat's patent application described a device within an oscilloscope, that helps to control the oscilloscope's screen illumination in a certain way. But the issue, according to the PTO, was whether the patent claimed merely that thing or claimed something else, as well—something that goes beyond the kinds of thing on which the patent laws grant exclusive rights.See dissenting opinion of Archer, C.J., arguing that PTO correctly rejected claim 15 as nonpatentable subject matter, stating—\\"Coexistent with the usage of these terms [used in § 101] has been the rule that a person cannot obtain a patent for the discovery of an abstract idea, principle or force, law of nature, or natural phenomenon, but rather must invent or discover a practical \\"application\\" to a useful end,\\" and citing, among other cases, Diamond v.

The board considered the claim thus to be the equivalent of a claim to computer instructions for carrying out a mathematical algorithm and therefore not patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.Ex parte Alappat, 23 U.S.P.Q.2d (B.N.A.) 1340 (B.P.A.I. 1992), rev'd, 33 F.3d 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1994). ==The Federal Circuit's opinion== The Federal Circuit heard the case en banc, meaning before all judges active on the court. There were a number of procedural issues unrelated to the patentability of computer software, including whether the court had jurisdiction over the appeal. Three judges abstained from joining any opinion on the merits, because of the jurisdictional issues, which resulted in the court's being very fractured and making it difficult to put together a majority. One judge (Michel, J.) who believed the court was without jurisdiction nonetheless joined the majority opinion, so that a bare majority of the eleven sitting judges joined in the majority opinion.See generally John A. Burtis, Comment: Towards a Rational Jurisprudence of Computer-Related Patentability in light of In re Alappat, 79 1129 (1994-1995). ===Majority opinion=== In the bare majority opinion for the court written by Judge Rich, the court found that Alappat claimed \\"a machine for converting discrete waveform data samples into anti–aliased pixel illumination intensity data to be displayed on a display means,\\" and not an abstract idea. The court noted that \\"Alappat admits that claim 15 would read on a general purpose computer programmed to carry out the claimed invention.\\" But this did not preclude the issuance of a patent, the court said, because the claimed subject matter was nonetheless a machine. \\"We have held that such programming creates a new machine, because a general purpose computer in effect becomes a special purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions pursuant to instructions from program software.\\"The court refers here to In re Bernhart, 417 F.2d 1395, 1400 (CCPA 1969). The court added: \\"In any case, a computer . . . is apparatus not mathematics.\\" ===Dissent=== The dissent by Chief Judge Archer objected to the majority's invocation of the piano roll blues argument: \\"[T]he majority implicitly resurrects long-dead precedent of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in direct conflict with Supreme Court precedent and subsequent precedent of that court.\\" Alappat claimed conventional apparatus (or a computer) arranged to make a mathematical calculation. The effect of the claim was to claim the mathematical calculation. Where \\"the invention or discovery is only of a 'new, useful, and nonobvious' process for solving a mathematical formula, Benson, Flook, Diehr, and years of precedent command that the patent law shall not exalt form over substance, but rather recognize that the substance is outside § 101.\\" Judge Archer (joined by Chief Judge Nies) argued that a Chopin-playing player piano does not magically become a \\"new\\" player piano simply because one inserts into it a piano roll for Brahms' Lullaby. He denied that a claim to a general- purpose digital computer running a new program could be directed to statutory subject matter: > It is illogical to say that although a claim to a newly discovered > mathematical operation to be performed by a computer is merely a > nonstatutory discovery of mathematics, a claim to any computer performing > that same mathematics is a statutory invention or discovery. ==Aftermath== Initially, it was uncertain what the Federal Circuit had decided in this case. Counsel for Tektronix, the successful party in the case, said that the decision held only that \\"digital circuitry governed by mathematical formulas can be patented.\\" He added, \\"The heart of the majority opinion rests on the conclusions that the Tektronix rasterizer was a machine. There is no justification, the majority said, in rejecting the patent simply because the machine made use of mathematics.\\"Information Law Alert (Sept. 9, 1994), quoting Francis Gray, an in-house lawyer at Tektronix. The same article states, \\"Fans of software patents say the ruling vindicates their belief that inventions related to software should receive patent protection.\\" One commentator said that two widely different interpretations were possible for what the court said the patent-eligible invention was, when it asserted that a \\"computer operating pursuant to software may represent patentable subject matter\\" if it meets the requirements of Title 35: > One interpretation is that [what the court says may be patented is] some > type of programmed computer equipment subsystem intertwined with an > oscilloscope, in which case the scope of claim 15 is limited to an > oscilloscope environment. Alternatively, \\"the claimed invention\\" also > includes a free-standing microprocessor or general-purpose digital computer > programmed to carry out the algorithm, in which event claim 15 is not > limited to the oscilloscope environment and effectively covers the algorithm > itself. The only way that this passage can make sense is if some of the > terms have a secret or private, question-begging meaning that is different > from their apparent meaning. For example, a programmed computer might > \\"represent\\" patentable subject matter but not \\"be\\" patentable subject > matter, whatever that might mean. Or maybe meeting \\"all of the other > requirements of Title 35\\" means complying with section 101 as interpreted in > Benson, Flook, Diehr, Abele, Schrader and so on.

The same commentator pointed out that different post-Alappat panels of the Federal Circuit had \\"embraced diverse interpretations of the decision.\\"Solving the Algorithm Conundrum at 187. It eventually became clear, after the Federal Circuit's 1998 State Street Bank decision, that the Federal Circuit had transitioned to a new patent-eligibility regime in which a patent would be allowed if the invention was able to \\"produce a useful, concrete, and tangible result.\\"Univ. of Tex. School of Law, 18th Annual Advanced Patent Law Institute, \\"Patentable Subject Matter: Software and Business Methods\\", p. 2 (Oct. 31, 2013) (\\"After the creation of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1982, the Federal Circuit heard several cases involving the patent eligibility of software related inventions coming to a head with the decision in 1998 in State Street Bank that seemed to open the floodgates of patents for software, business methods and other related inventions by holding that such patents only needed to provide a \\"useful, concrete and tangible result\\" to be patent eligible.\\")The phrase appears to have first been used in the majority opinion in this case. Moreover, the piano roll blues theory temporarily became dominant in the Federal Circuit for about a decade after Alappat.See, e.g., WMS Gaming, Inc. v. International Game Technology, 184 F.3d 1339, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v. International Game Technology, 521 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In a 2006 dissenting opinion, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Breyer (joined by Justices Stevens and Souter, characterized the Alappat decision as one of the Federal Circuit's decisions in which it used a legal test that led to results opposite to those reached in several Supreme Court decisions.. In Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593 (2010), the Supreme Court was unanimous that the \\"useful, concrete, and tangible result\\" test of Alappat and State Street was an incorrect statement of the law.This point is explained in the concurring opinion of Justice Breyer in that case. The Federal Circuit had made the same ruling in In re Bilski, the judgment in which the Supreme Court affirmed in Bilski v. Kappos. ==References== Category:Software patent case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit cases Category:United States patent case law Category:1998 in United States case law ","title":"In re Alappat"},{"id":"46867944","text":"Ignacio Alejandro Jeraldino Jil (born 6 December 1995) is a Chilean footballer who plays as striker for Liga MX club Atlas and Chile national team.

At the age of nineteen he found himself in command of a fine Indiaman when the captain died at sea. He subsequently commanded a number of ships of the Duncan Dunbar line, and earned a high reputation and made rapid progress through the ranks of the company. He made, as captain of the David Malcolm, a splendid barque of 538 tons, three trips bringing migrants from London to Adelaide : in January 1847, March 1848, and April 1849. His next trips to the colony were in charge of the brig Flash, 159 tons, from Melbourne in December 1851, and February 1852, then he settled down to a life on shore. He bought a property at Woodville and started a shipping agency at Port Adelaide. For a time he owned the brig Lord Montgomery, then in August 1853 purchased the barque Templeton, which traded between Adelaide and Melbourne during the Ballarat gold rush.

The Todd Shipyards Corporation was significantly impacted by this strike. The bargaining between the unions under the Pacific Coast Metal Trades District Council, and the Pacific Shipbuilders Association led to a new contract, but that did not prevent Todd Shipyards from losing a significant amount of business and subsequent loss of workers in the years that followed. == Background == The Todd Seattle shipyard was one of several yards operated by the New York-based Todd Shipyards Corporation in the 1980s. It was also once the largest shipbuilding company in the United States . The Seattle shipyard was acquired in 1915 along with docks in New Jersey and New York under the William H. Todd Corporation before the company name was changed. During World War I, Todd Shipyards built close to 90% of the U.S. naval convoy, leading to a boom in production and employment figures (18,000 workers on payroll). However at the end of the war, the payroll shrank to 2,000 due to a massive drop in demand. By the time World War II started, there was again great demand for naval vessels and other shipbuilding services. To fight an effective war at sea, a strong naval fleet was paramount and a priority of the U.S. Government. Todd Shipyards was again at the forefront of this labor demand and employed 57,000 workers over the course of the war. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, civilian contracts were superseded by military contracts yet again in large part due to the Carter and Reagan administrations' defense buildup. By 1983, the company was geared primarily toward military contracts leading to an over-reliance on government contracts (which dwindled)-causing an inevitable fall in profits and work. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan eliminated a 44-year-old federal shipbuilding subsidy, doubling costs for US shipbuilders such as Todd. Because Todd had significantly higher labor costs than some other US shipyards, it submitted higher bids for Naval contracts, losing the work to other US shipyards. The lack of Naval contracts pressured Todd to resist further pay increases in union contract negotiations. In 1982, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) across the United States were running out. The lack of the ability to fund wage increases for American workers was worrisome for industries such as shipbuilding on the West Coast, especially after Ronald Reagan's cuts in shipbuilding subsidies. Industrial production was down nearly nine percent in October 1982 from the previous year, and unemployment was at 10.2% in November. == Union talks== Throughout 1982, with the older contracts coming to a close, a series of talks took place among Steel industry representatives, most of which proved unfruitful. And, in the Summer of 1983, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for West coast metal workers expired leaving workers without a contract and with adequate wage guarantees. The Pacific Coast Metal Trades Union strike lasted from July 26 to September 26, 1983, and in the case of Todd Shipyards was the result of the workers being dissatisfied with a new wage offer (they voted the offer down 6,535 to 54 against). This led to a shortage of metalworkers in the yard-and hence lack of adequate labor to compete for bids. Nine shipyards along the West coast were affected by this strike from San Francisco to Seattle, 11 unions under the Pacific Coast Metal Trades District Council. == Aftermath == With the void in military contracts, forfeit civilian contracts, and now even higher labor costs, Todd Shipyards was struggling to stay afloat. Todd completed its $3 billion contract with the U.S. Government in 1983, and began a period of significant decline for the company. In 1986, the Todd Corporation filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.Mitchell, Bradford C. Every Kind of Shipwork: A History of Todd Shipyards Corporation, 1916–1981. Todd Shipyard Corporation: New York. 1981. 37, 112. The new Collective Bargaining Agreement reached by the Metalworkers Union did little in terms of preventing the Todd Shipyard from other factors that ultimately contributed to its failure just a few years later. Todd was already struggling with being overpriced in its bids on ship contracts and with the higher wages in the new agreement, this continued. This led to the eventual closure of all shipyards under Todd except for the Seattle shipyard by the end of 1990.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 14. St. James Press, 1996. 507-509. == Re-thinking business == With government contracts no longer supplying the lion's share of contracts for Todd, they increasingly turned to smaller civilian jobs, including the construction of Washington State Ferrys and other projects. This was a direct result of a decrease of 45% in government work and increase in profit margins in 1994.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 14. St. James Press, 1996. 507-509. In 2011, Todd Shipyards was purchased by Vigor Industrial for about $130 million. == References  Further reading == * Collective Bargaining on behalf of West Coast Sheet Metal Workers-Court Proceedings * 1983 Bargaining Agreement in San Pedro * Possible Mesothelioma at Todd Shipyard * Industries: Business History of Shipbuilding * Todd Shipyards Asbestos Exposure Category:1983 labor disputes and strikes Category:Labor disputes in the United States Category:Maritime labor disputes in the United States ","title":"1983 Pacific Coast Metal Trades Union strike"},{"id":"46868213","text":"Indian Ball is a \\"bat-and-ball\\" game featuring a baseball bat and ball. The sport originated in the late 1940s in St. Louis, Missouri so that if 18 players weren't available to play a regular baseball game or a full sized field wasn't available they could play an alternate game much like baseball but for fewer players.http://www.stlmag.com/What-the-Is-Indian-Ball/ ==General Rules== Indian Ball is played in any size area from a regular baseball field to a side yard or street. The game can be played with any number of players from normally 1 to ten. A ball may be put into play in one of three different ways. Pitched by a teammate, side tossed by a teammate or tossed by the batter themselves. If the ball is put in play and hits or is touched by the pitcher it is an automatic out. Only infielders can field balls in the infield and only outfielders are allowed to field balls in the outfield. If in any case an infielder plays a ball in the outfield or an outfielder plays a ball in the infield it is an automatic double (two points). ==Rules== 3 strikes equals an out and 4 balls equals an out so that pace is sped up and the batter cannot wait around for a perfect pitch. A ball that is caught by a player in all locations (fair, foul or deadzone) without hitting the ground results in an out. If a ball is hit in play in the infield and an infielder (regardless if it was touched or deflected off them or someone else) before it comes to a complete stop results in an out. If a ball is hit into or lands in the infield before the infielders get to it (regardless if it was touched or deflected of a player) results in a single (one point). A ball that is hit into the outfield (regardless of whether it is a grounder, line drive, or pop fly) but does not get behind an outfielder and is picked up by an outfielder before it comes to a stop (regardless of whether they or someone else touched it) it results in a single (1 Point). A ground ball that makes it into the outfield and is kept in front of an outfielder but is not picked up by the outfielder before it comes to a complete stop is a Double (2 Points). A fly ball that lands in the outfield in front of an outfielder and is not picked up by an outfielder before it comes to a stop (but does not get behind an outfielder) is a Double (2 Point). A ball that lands in front of an outfielder and then gets behind that outfielder (regardless of whether the outfielders touched it or not) and is not picked up before it comes to a stop equals a Triple (3 Points). A fly ball that lands in front of an outfielder and gets behind the outfielder and is not picked up by an outfielder before it comes to a stop is a Triple (3 Points). A fly ball that lands behind an outfielder (no matter the distance behind) without being touched by that outfielder and is not picked up before it comes to a stop is a Home Run (4 Points). Points that result in a negative result are when returning the ball back to the next batter, if the infielder who fielded the ball (when throwing from the spot where they fielded the ball) hits the bat with the ball the score of the batting team is reduced by one point (-1 Points). Another is When returning the ball back to the next batter, if the outfielder (when throwing from the spot where they fielded the ball) hits the bat with the ball the score of the batting team is reduced by two points (-2 Points). ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official Rules Category:Baseball genres Category:Ball games Category:Street games Category:Team sports Category:Ball and bat games ","title":"Indian Ball"},{"id":"46868246","text":"Dhir Ali Miah (1 January 1920 – 1984) was a Bangladeshi flute player, composer, director and orchestra conductor.

While both rhema and logos are translated into the English \\"word\\", in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction. In some Charismatic Christianity groups advocating Five-Fold Ministry (including the Pentecostal Movement, Apostolic-Prophetic Movement and Word of Faith Movement) the use of the term rhema has special significance. ==Epistemology== Some Christians, such as Apostolic-Prophetic Movement Christian minister and author Bill Hamon, put forward the position that rhema is a process within Christian epistemology. In this understanding, the logos is universal for all humanity, while any intellectual changes for a specific individual believer are categorized as rhema. Under this system, \\"rhema\\" is a broad term that includes many types of spiritual interaction; \\"any method God uses to reveal His specific will to an individual, whether by divinely directed desire, illumination, revelation, vision, or dream. ...rhema will be our general term to refer to all of these means of God communicating His specific will to an individual.\\" Hamon states \\"A rhema is an inspired Word birthed within your own spirit, a whisper from the Holy Spirit like the still, small voice that spoke to Elijah in the cave. It is a divinely inspired impression upon your soul, a flash of thought or a creative idea from God. It is conceived in your spirit, but birthed into your natural understanding by divine illumination. A true rhema carries with it a deep inner assurance and witness of the Spirit.\\" Citing John 1:1,14 Hamon holds \\"Jesus was the eternal Word revealed and manifest in mortal flesh\\" and can be called by the personal name \\"Logos\\". Citing Timothy 2:15 Hamon defines the less personal usage \\"logos\\" as \\"the Scriptures as a whole\\". He defines rhema as \\"a specific word from the Lord that applies it to us individually. …The Logos is like a well of water, and the rhema is a bucket of water from that well. …Truth is truth, and the Logos and rhema are one with God.\\" The logos \\"is the standard of all truth...the rhema, [is that] which provides the precise word needed for the specific situation. All Christians must live by the logos and receive the rhema as needed.\\" Under this definition the method of receiving rhemas \\"may come by many ways. A rhema may come while reading the Bible, as God quickens a certain text, or it may come to us through the spoken words of another person.\\" In support of this Hamon cites Ephesians 6:17 \\"take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word (rhema) of God\\", and points to William Edwy Vine's An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words that explains the passage \\"Here the reference is not to the whole Bible as such, but to the individual scripture which the Spirit brings to our remembrance for use in time of need, a prerequisite being the regular storing of the mind with scripture\\". Hamon, expounding on Romans 10:17 goes on to say that a rhema is \\"that timely, Holy Spirit-inspired Word from the Logos that brings life, power, and faith to perform and fulfil it...[it] must be received with faith by the hearer in order for it to fulfil its mission.\\" Pentecostal minister and author Jack W. Hayford shares similar sentiments saying Pastor Watchman Nee writing along the same lines wrote: According to Nee a passage of the logos can move into being rhema if it becomes shown to apply to the specific individual. As an example Nee holds the statement in Scripture at John 3:16 \\"that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life\\" is held to have moved from logos to become rhema if the believer feels a realization that the passage is saying to them \\"It is I who will not perish and it is I who even now have eternal life.\\" According to Nee at such an instance \\"God speaks the word to us, and at the same moment, we have faith. ...This does not mean that logos is of no use...for without logos, we could never have rhema. All the rhema of God is based upon logos. Christian author Alfred Raa Olson also maintains that the only source of true knowledge of YHWH is by the working of the Holy Spirit. He holds that where the Bible says ==Possible link to Hebrew term Memra== Professor of Biblical Studies Shirley Christian links the Greek word Rhema to the use of the Hebrew word memra which was used in rabbinic Judaism since before the advent of Christianity. She takes special note of the use of memra in the Targum, \\"where it is used when speaking of God's expression of Himself. ...[and] figures constantly as the manifestation of the divine power. When God inspires a prophetic Word, this Rhema care is with it, the power to produce the end result.\\" She cites the Jewish Encyclopedia on the matter, and it states that Memra The Encyclopedia also notes that Memra \\"becomes more and more a personified agency\\" in the biblical apocrypha and rabbinic literature, and in the Targum it \\"figures constantly as the manifestation of the divine power, or as God's messenger in place of God Himself, wherever the predicate is not in conformity with the dignity or the spirituality of the Deity.\\" ==Bible incidents== Bill Hamon holds that while the Bible has much truth that is \\"universally valid...the general word which is the eternal logos for everyone\\"; there are also \\"personal prophecies which were given to individuals or groups, and are not universally valid\\" - these are \\"the rhema of personal prophecy in the Bible\\" they are instances of messages to \\"specific instructions [that] are not for everyone\\". Examples he cites are YHWH's instructions for Noah to build an Ark, for Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, for Hosea to marry a harlot, for Isaiah to walk around naked for three years, and Jacob receiving prophetic words about the descendants of his sons. Watchman Nee uses additional examples such as the Annunciation where Mary tells the angel \\"May it happen to me according to your rhema.\\" Nee also points to Simeon who had been granted to live till he saw the birth of the Messiah, once seeing the baby Jesus he says \\"Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your rhema, in peace.\\" He points to the calling of John the Baptist in Luke 3:2 \\"the rhema of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.\\" Nee also points to Peter's memory after his denial of Jesus as a rhema – \\"The rhema was that which was brought to his remembrance. While Peter was telling a lie, suddenly rhema came. The very sentence of the Lord came to him. Rhema is the word which the Lord has spoken, and now He speaks it again.\\" Nee points to where Simon Peter on the fishing boat says to Jesus \\"Master, through the whole night we toiled and caught nothing; but based on Your rhema I will let down the nets.\\" Nee says \\"The 'word' in this verse was something spoken by the Lord for that occasion. It was the Lord speaking personally to Simon.\\" Nee points to when Peter is told \\"Come\\" by Jesus walking on the water \\"If someone attempted to walk on the sea because of Matthew 14:29, he would certainly sink. This is not the word which the Lord is speaking today, though He did speak it on that day. It is true that the word spoken by God in the past and the word He speaks today carry the same authority; they have never changed. But the important thing is this: Is God speaking that very word to us today?\\" Nee says these events were not \\"according to a certain chapter or a certain verse in the Bible, but it was according to the word spoken\\" to these individuals, and \\"Only the word which the Lord speaks to us is of any use. The rhema reveals something to us personally and directly; it shows us what we need to deal with and what we need to be cleansed from. We must specifically seek after this very matter, because our Christian life is based on this rhema. …We must remember that today's Christianity is still the Christianity of personal revelation. If the Lord does not speak within man, it is not Christianity, nor is it the New Testament.\\" ==As necessary for salvation== Some Christians, such as Bill Gothard, of Institute in Basic Life Principles, hold that rhema are an integral part of even being able to claim to be Christian. He says that as \\"'No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost\\" (I Corinthians 12:3). Therefore, it is appropriate for the message of salvation to be a rhema.\\" He goes on to cite \\"'The word [rhema] is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word [rhema] of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved…. So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word [rhema] of God' (Romans 10:8–9, 17; see also Acts 5:20). …[Jesus says] 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word [rhema] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God' (Matthew 4:4). Jesus also stated, 'The words [rhema] that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life' (John 6:63).\\" Gothard holds that only by rhema is the believer able \\"to apply the promise of John 15:7–8 and experience marvelous results from it. 'If ye abide in me, and my words [rhema] abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.'\\" ==As necessary for evangelizing== Olson maintains that evangelizing can only be effective, not by reflection of the hearer, but \\"the Holy Ghost must take what was said and reveal the thought behind it. …That puts all preachers on the same level. God is neither helped nor hindered by our vocabulary, or eloquent speech. Paul said [in 1 Corinthians 2:1], 'I came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.' …We can receive nothing unless it be given from above.\\" ==As overcoming language differences== Questions about translation are also covered by this doctrine according to Olson. He holds that it is by the empowering by the Holy Spirit that the truth of the Gospels overcomes any concern over problems of both evangelizing through an interpreter and translations of texts including the Bible. He holds that textual translators uses of paraphrases, their attempts to convey the \\"sense\\" of a text rather than make a literal translation, the additions or removal of words (depending on manuscripts translated), alterations to convey understanding because of changes in the modern language usage, and a host of other concerns are overcome by the Holy Spirit's enlivening in this manner. By this then translators additions of words to convey meaning are not violations of Revelation 22:18-19 because the prohibition there is not about mere words but deeper spiritual truths. Olson says \\"Words are sometimes added because there's no English equivalent. The Bible is God's thoughts...and although the various translations use different words we cannot add one [divine thought]. Unless the Holy Ghost reveals it personally, we can never get the... [divine thought] in the first place.\\" In support of this Olson points out that Jesus did not teach in Greek the language the Bible was written in, but in the common language of his audience (Aramaic). He holds this might be a concern for other texts \\"But 'God watches over His Word:' He watches over...[His divine thought]. [Regardless of what translation they heard] Those...who were predestined, caught the same thought and as came forth when Jesus preached It two thousand years ago.\\" ==As hermeneutical inspiration== Hamon differentiates between \\"the illuminating work of the Holy Spirit to bring out the deeper and greater meaning of Scripture [which] is a personal event\\" and personal prophecy \\"God's revelation of His thoughts and intents to a particular person, family, or group of people. It is specific information coming from the mind of God for a specific situation, an inspired word directed to a certain audience…a word from the Word\\". Still, within his ontology as both these spiritual encounters happen to specific individuals their occurrence are both classified as receiving rehma. Hamon says \\"God sometimes reveal His Will by a rhema from 'out of the clear blue.' But at other times we receive it by an illumination of a particular Scripture. As we read God sends a quickening rhema that says, 'This applies to you.' ...This type of divine directive may also be called 'revelation knowledge' or 'Scriptural illumination.'\\" Hamon holds \\"Jesus received direction for His ministry that way\\". He cites Luke 4:16-21 were Jesus reads a scroll of Isaiah in the Nazareth synagogue and \\"Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written [the text of Isaiah 61:1-2;58:6]...Then he rolled up the scroll...[and began] by saying to them, 'Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.'\\" Concerning receiving deeper understanding of Scripture from the Holy Spirit Hamon says \\"The Bible give the factual knowledge of God, His Word, Will and Way, His plan and purpose for mankind. Fact, however, is not faith. But, fact (Scripture) can become faith when it is quickened by the Holy Spirit and mixed with heart belief. The writer of Hebrews revealed this truth when he said, 'The word [logos] did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it' (Heb. 4:2). The Logos plus the Holy Spirit quickening and faith equals a rhema from the Lord.\\" Hamon goes on to say \\"there is a big difference between preaching and personal prophecy; between quoting the logos and speaking a rhema; between speaking faith statements based on scriptural truth and speaking the specific mind of the Lord for that individual: between speaking the Word of God and speaking a word from the Lord.\\" Hamon says \\"Paul declared that faith for specific miracles come not from our opinions but rather from a rhema from the Logos: 'Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the rhema of God' (Rom. 10:17). …the rhema spoken from our mouth has to come from our heart as a rhema in order to be effective: 'The rhema is nigh thee even in your heart and mouth, that is the rhema of faith' (Rom. 10:8).\\" Citing Hebrews 4:2 Hamon states \\"The Bible gives the factual knowledge of God, His Word, Will and Way, His plan and purpose for mankind. Fact, however is not faith. But, fact (Scripture) can become faith when it is quickened by the Holy Spirit and mixed with heart belief.\\" \\"The logos plus the Holy Spirit quickening and faith equals a rhema form the Lord. As a minister I preach the Logos, but as a prophet I prophesy the rhema. General biblical truth does not guarantee specific application and appropriation of that truth. A preacher speaks from the letter of the Word which applies to all men for all time, while the prophet speaks from the Spirit of the Word which is personalized to a particular person for a specific situation.\\" Along similar lines Olson holds that unless the Holy Spirit enliven your understanding no amount of Bible study will do any good as 1 Corinthians 2:14 states \\"The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.\\" Olson points to 1 John 2:20-27 saying only by the indwelling action of the Holy Spirit do \\"you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. …[and] no lie comes from the truth. …the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain in him.\\" ==As cleansing== Pastor Nee wrote \\"In the eternal plan of God the church is without sin. ...In what way will Christ bring the church into perfection? He will do it by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the word--the rhema.\\" Nee holds that Jesus used his physical life to provide redemption from sin and \\"Christ is using His life in His word, His rhema, to cleanse us.\\" Nee says the Church's \\"defect is not that the Christ whom she has received is too little, but that she has too many things other than Christ. The church in God's will comes entirely out of Christ, without any sin, without any flesh, and containing no natural life. ...Every one of who truly belongs to Christ has a certain portion which is solely and wholly Christ. ...In addition to this portion, we still have many things which are not of Christ. We need to be cleansed because of all these other things. ...Many times we do not know in which aspect we need to be cleansed. But one day the life within us will not let us go. Before long His rhema comes into us, indicating what must be dealt with.\\" Nee states that this being held back can occur even when \\"we are engaged in something which seems quite good according to doctrine, and our reason for doing it is also quite right, but within there is something which keeps touching us and will not let us go. Eventually, the Lord speaks to us; rhema comes, the mighty word of the Lord. It tells us that a certain matter must be dealt with and cleansed. ...If we have any inner feeling in life, we should never let it go. We must pray, 'Lord, please give the rhema that I might know hoe to deal with this situation.' ...If we pay attention to these matters and do not take them lightly, the Lord will cleanse us by the washing of the water in the word that we may be sanctified. ...The natural life and all that is not out of Christ must be purged away. Sanctification can only come after cleansing, and the basis of cleansing is the Lord's word, the rhema. If we do not know the Lord's word, there is no way for us to be cleansed and sanctified.\\" Nee holds that to be truly Christian one can not rely on \\"an outward source\\" but \\"an inward one\\" in order to \\"understand the will of God from within\\" and not have \\"His will still something outside of us\\". By means of believers inward reception of rhema \\"He [Jesus] intends to restore and recover them to what He proposed in eternity past, so that He might have that which fulfills His desire in eternity future. In his magnificent work, the Lord is using the words He speaks as the instrument to bring the church back to God's original purpose.\\" In this Nee maintains \\"All doctrine, teaching, theology, and knowledge are of little use if they just flow from one person to another. True growth depends upon our receiving the word directly from God. God is using His rhema to do His work, and He desires to speak to us. Therefore, if our purpose in reading he Scriptures is solely for knowledge, it is indeed pitiful. If this is so, we are finished. The real value of the Scriptures is that God can speak to man through them. If we desire to be useful in the Lord's hands, we must be spoken to by the Lord. Whether or not our building is spiritual depends upon whether the Lord has spoken to us. Knowledge and doctrine are of no spiritual use. Only the Lord's speaking in us is of spiritual value. ...Only rehma is of any value. If we do something just because others tell us to do it, we are keeping the law; we are not in the New Testament.\\" Nee holds that \\"knowledge of the Scriptures and understanding of the doctrine\\" are not spirituality, \\"Bible knowledge can never be a substitute for spirituality. Only God's speaking to us, personally and directly is of any real value. ...We need to know what is dead and what is living, what is mere knowledge and what is spiritual. Whatever is not living has no spiritual value. If we have rhema, the living word of God, we can be cleansed and sanctified.\\" Nee states that by this use of rhema Ephesians 5:25-27 will be fulfilled and Jesus will \\"sanctify and cleanse it [the Church] with the washing of water by the word (rhema). That he might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.\\" Nee holds that by rhema Jesus will \\"bring the Church to the stage where there is nothing old, where there is nothing of the past. He wants everything in the church to be new. ...it should be holy and blameless. God will bring the Church to the place where nothing can be said against her in any respect.\\" At that point the world, Satan, or \\"even God Himself will have nothing to say. In that day, when the Church is so glorious, she will become the Bride of Christ.\\" Nee holds believers \\"are Christ's own Body. As His Body, Christ is purging and preparing us...Now we are in the process of being cleansed. Now is the time that we need the rhema. Dr. Shirley Christian states that sometimes when a minister is preaching will result in \\"the Spirit of God quickening the logos and it becomes a rhema to the person...[which] brings the healing.\\" She notes \\"Often a person with a ministry to multitudes observes this type of healing manifestation. The minister may then ask any that were healed as the Word was proclaimed and the anointing released to come forward to testify.\\" ==Personal prophecies== Hamon holds that personal prophecies are rhemas and while the prophecy of the logos never fails, \\"the Bible is full of rhemas given to individuals which failed to come to pass. Actually...it was not the rhema of the Lord which failed, but rather the people who heard it failed to understand, interpret, believe, obey, respond, wait upon, or act upon it according to God's will and way. This is the meaning of 1 Corinthians 13:8: 'Prophecies shall fail.' When God speaks directly or through a prophet to a person or a nation, and they fail to respond appropriately, the prophecy may not come to pass.\\" He also holds that as they come from the same divine source \\"No true rhema spoken by a present-day prophet will be in conflict with the spirit and context of the logos. ...Preaching proclaims the logos, while prophecy gives rhema from the Logos. Both are the word of God.\\" Hamon holds that a believer willing to be an instrument of prophecy can error if they focus on universal truths of logos, such as \\"divine healing is a scriptural truth\\" rather than waiting to receive a rhema. In such a case if a believer claims they have a personal prophecy to deliver to another saying \\"'God showed me you are going to be healed,' or 'Thus saith the Lord I have healed you and you shall live and not die.'\\" But if that person prophesied to dies this \\"presumptuous prophesying will also bring reproach on the gift of prophecy, the ministry of prophesying, and the office of the prophet\\" because they are \\"doctrinally-directed, instead of divinely inspired, prophecies\\". Along these lines Pastor Nee wrote \\"We will always treasure the fact that the Lord still speaks today. He not only spoke in the Scriptures, He not only spoke to Paul and John, He is also speaking to us today. Whenever someone who is working for the Lord stand up to speak for Him, he must expect the rhema. If the Lord does not speak to us today, we are really failures. How many times have we preached, yet the Lord did not speak a word? It is not that there was something wrong with the message, but it was all the general word of the Lord; there was no rhema in it. The problem with the church today is that it lacks the living word of the Lord; instead there are only dead doctrines. There is only a passing on of man's preaching. ...Only when we have rhema can we move ahead and have the living water to supply to others. What we need is rhema.\\" Dr. Shirley Christian also holds that \\"The Prophetic Word will bring healing, miracles, deliverance and wholeness.\\" She holds \\"so-called prophecy spoken from a knowledge of the Word...is presumption\\" and what is required is \\"rather a true prophetic Word filled with he Spirit and life--one directly from God. When God gives a word of knowledge, word of wisdom or a prophetic Word on healing, it becomes the Rhema that is filled with Spirit and life. The Rhema Word has within it, the spiritual seed that releases faith, life and power. Its fulfilment is accomplished through the operation of the Holy Spirit. ...The Lord's will is clear on healing, and we preach and teach it from the Scriptures. A minister may believe strongly and speak from his/her faith using a scripture--this Word, if not prophetic, may miss the mark if not united with the sick one's faith. But when such a one receives a personal prophecy, a true prophetic Word form the Lord, it contains life-giving power to accomplish the miraculous.\\" She holds \\"a Rhema word\\" is \\"receiving a download from God for a person or the Spirit of God directly\\". She holds that Elisha sent such a rhema to Naaman in 2 Kings 5:10 and when he obeyed this \\"the Word came to pass.\\" She goes on to say \\"In the New Testament, prophets are also active in speaking a Rhema and accomplishing healing--and this continues today.\\" She holds that through rhema, prophets today are able to fulfil the mission Jesus laid out in Luke 4:18 including \\"recovery of sight for the blind\\". Citing Isaiah 50:4 she holds that prophets today can have \\"the Spirit of Counsel\\" come upon them and they can speak \\"a Word of deliverance prophetically for someone\\", which results in \\"inner healing begins to manifest in the person.\\" She calls on believers to follow 2 Chronicles 20:20 and \\"Put your trust in His prophets and succeed.\\" Hamon holds that in cases where statements about healing were believed to be rhema but fail it was because \\"personal conviction of the scriptural truth of divine healing\\" has interfered with receiving actual rhema for the sick individual and \\"This is the main reason so many words given as a personal prophecy or rhema fail to come to pass… The main problems are mindset, soul blockage and doctrinal domination that keep us from being Holy Spirit-directed.\\" A believer wanting to be a conduit for prophecy must also be \\"earnestly and sincerely seeking God about the matter\\" and be wary of their \\"own wishful thinking and imagination.\\" To overcome these obstacles Hamon holds there is a \\"need of prophets being trained and under apprenticeship to an older mature prophet—as Elisha was to Elijah\\". Failed rhema makes it so a prophet may \\"justly be judged and proclaimed a false representative of the mind of God in the matter\\"; but it does not automatically mean that person is a false prophet it is \\"rather his immaturity, zeal, and biblical convictions had motivated him to give a presumptuous prophecy\\" and should \\"be a humbling, learning process to prepare him to be a mature prophet.\\" Citing Deuteronomy 17:6; 19:15 and 2 Corinthians 13:1, Hamon holds that \\"the scriptural requirement that everything must be confirmed in the mouth of two or three witnesses before accepting the fact...can be applied to a word of counsel, a word of prophecy, or a rhema word. Just as the general Will of God cannot be established by a single verse, neither can the specific Will of God be established by one prophecy, one rhema, one counselor, or one anything else. ...He [YHWH] insists that in all serious matters there be at least two and preferably three witnesses before you accept a prophetic word.\\" ==Finding rhema== In some Christian groups (such as Daybreak Resources) rhema is defined as \\"God's Word Spoken to You\\". One of the methods to find rhema is for the believer to look over lists of scriptural passages that are grouped by themes and choose one \\"that stands out from the list for you.\\" The believer is than to \\"Read it slowly and quietly (as in \\"hagah\\" mediation).\\" The believer is to read the prayer repeatedly until a few lines hold their attention, and then slowly and quietly repeat those lines with closed eyes until \\"this scripture will root in you and other words will begin to rise from your heart and interact with the scripture.\\" Which are taken to mean \\"God is speaking to you and you are speaking to Him.\\" The believer is said to \\"experience the confidence of this communication.\\" In this way the believer is held to experience that \\"The Word has become rhema in your heart and you are praying a scripture that is alive and active in you.\\" Any spontaneous prayers should be recorded for future use. Along these lines Pastor Nee writes that \\"Luke 24:8 says, 'They remembered His words (rhema),'\\" similarly \\"In Acts 11:16 Peter said, 'And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John baptised in water, but you shall be baptised in the Holy Spirit.' While Peter was preaching to the household of Cornelius, the Spirit of the Lord fell upon them, and the word of the Lord came to Peter. It was not that Peter tried to recall the word from his memory [of the events of Acts 1:5], but it was the Lord who spoke to him, 'John baptized with water, but you shall be baptised in the Holy Spirit.'\\" Nee holds that this is because \\"Rhema is something the Lord has spoken previously which He is now speaking again. In other words, rhema is the word which the Lord speaks the second time. This is something living.\\" Jamee Rae at Sharefaith echoes these sentiments \\"Through daily reading of God's Word, which is referred to as the logos, Christians will have knowledge of God and be able to memorize Scripture and to offer non-believers the truth that is written. But in addition to that, God wants to speak to His people and provide insight beyond human understanding. With the help of the Holy Spirit, portions of Scripture that were once words on a page will become rhema. They will have great significance and offer supernatural guidance, comfort, answers and assurances. Intermittent rhema from Scripture is good, but daily rhema will guide a Christian's steps and move them toward greater understanding, revelation and joy.\\" Other Christian groups also hold that reading the Bible can bring rhemas to the believer, such as the Advanced Training Institute International who teach \\"In the regular course of our daily reading of God’s Word (logos), we need to ask God to speak to us through His Word and give us insight into it. The Holy Spirit can cause certain passages to stand out with significant meaning or application for our lives. These are the rhemas of Scripture and should become a part of our daily thoughts and actions.\\" ==Criticism== Non-charismatic Christian groups can take issue with the Charismatic Christians having rhema doctrines. Pastor James Patrick Holding of Tekton Education and Apologetics Ministry holds that its clear those accepting this doctrine have \\"simply started with a legitimate dichotomy (spoken [rhema] vs. written [logos] word) and created out of whole cloth additional dichotomies to attach to each; in this case, the idea that 'spoken' revelation is in effect now, written revelation is not.\\" Holding maintains that \\"the likely reason for the use of rhema is that most of Paul's audience is illiterate (the letter would have to be read to them), at least 90% of them, thus for the vast majority, hearing and transmission of the Gospel will be by spoken means. There is nothing here to suggest that the rhema will be like some sort of special communication from which we can (or will) receive personal messages.\\" He holds that passages were words are held to have power (like Proverbs 18:21 & James 3) is about moral and not supernatural effect (unlike the divine words that created the universe Hebrews 11:3). He holds that the believers in rhema doctrine do not adequately answer how the claim of modern prophetic statements is not a violation of Revelation 22:18-19 that forbids adding anything to the Bible. Holding also points out that there is little to no emphasis on testing a prophet among those who advocate rhema doctrine, and agrees that rhema believers diminish the role of education in the knowledge of Christian Scriptures. He points out that some believers in this doctrine put the value of knowledge of Scripture into question. As an example Holding points to the writing ofs Alfred Raa Olson in his defense of William M. Branham who said \\"Education is an accumulation of knowledge without faith.\\" Holding maintains that this is to \\"disdain education\\", to open oneself \\"to dismiss contrary evidence\\", and to \\"commit to self-deception.\\" The fundamentalist evangelical ministry GotQuestions.org speaks dismissively of rhema doctrine categorizing the experience in non-mystical terms \\"inner feelings, impressions and experiences.\\" They hold that \\"rhema is essentially synonymous with logos. In other words, the specific guidance we receive from the Holy Spirit at any given time can only be discerned by the general principles laid down in the Bible.\\" This ministry holds that rather than seek prophecy about an individuals day-to-day specifics \\"the Christian applies biblical principles to the situation and thereby arrives at a decision.\\" They take issue with the position that \\"the direct words of God to the individual can also be imparted through the words of others, such as a preacher in a worship service or a friend who counsels them.\\" They charge that implicit in the doctrine \\"There is also the belief that the spoken word has more power than the written word, but there is no biblical basis for such a belief.\\" They warn \\"The obvious danger is that one who is not familiar with the logos can misinterpret or misunderstand what he or she perceives to be a rhema.\\" Examining the claim that a passage of Scripture can become a \\"rhema word\\" from YHWH for a specific application for a believer, Holding says \\"we have no way of telling if this 'rhema word' is any better at all than the Mormon internal witness -- other than by epistemic means that make the revelatory aspect of no relevance. Scriptural validation of this practice is almost non-existent. ...There is nothing here [at Epehsians 6:17] to suggest in the least that the sword of the Spirit is associated with continued revelation.\\" Holding returns to his position that rhema as personal prophecy is \\"no better off than the Mormons without epistemic tests (such as Deuteronomy [18:20-22] clearly teaches)\\". When those with rhema doctrines proclaim that \\"Jesus said, 'My sheep hear my Voice [John 10:27]'\\" or \\"the Bride of Christ will not be deceived. She hears his logos and knows [referencing Songs 5:2-4, Revelation 3:2, Luke 12:36; John 10:3]\\"; Holding says this is \\"simple begging of the question.\\" Holding rejects the position that rhema can be used as a measure of truth when considering competing biblical interpretations or competing statements from religious leaders – seeing this rhema doctirne as an appeal to mere feeling, sentiment, and emotion. He says the question of why Christians should accept \\"Rhema [as a measure of epistemological truth] over a Mormon burning bosom is never explained. Nothing is offered but implied consequences for not believing that beg the question of authority\\". He holds this is a \\"logical circle\\" where believers know whom to follow because that person has the true rhema and they know that person has a true rhema because they are leading. Holding holds that the main problem with the doctrine is its \\"clear that the epistemic center of the circle rests rather in subjectivity of experience\\" rather than the validator being the Bible interpreted correctly. Arise My Love Ministries also questions rhema doctrine on this point. They state that according to the doctrine the fulfillment of a statement declared to be a rhema and spoken to a receiving believer has to be accepted in absolute faith for there to be a possibility of it coming to pass and that \\"teaches that failed, false or 'unfulfilled' modern prophecy is because of the 'lack of faith' of the receiver of the prophecy\\". At the same time another aspect of the doctrine is that there always remains the possibility that the person held to be speaking a rhema to that believer may be presumptuous and confusing doctrine with rhema. They concluded that this means that under this system modern prophecy was actually \\"'conditional'; and yet the person being prophesied over had to receive that 'conditional' word as if it were 'factual and true' as the 'engrafted Word of God.'... [this] \\"teaches that untested modern prophecy must be received as true, and in 'faith'. This is equivalent of having 'faith' in something unsubstantiated by the Bible; it is the equivalent of having blind faith in the blind faith put in 'established' prophets...[and] teaches all modern prophecy is conditional, even if those conditions aren’t stated at the time of the prophecy!

They concluded that this was teaching \\"that God was like a Magic Eight Ball in the Sky\\" where \\"we can pull down at will and on demand 'prophecies' that are 'false' but also 'true' at the same time.\\" They also held that this placed too much emphasis on the actions and conditions of humans, robbing YHWH of His sovereignty.

Ten thousand workers walked out at the height of the strike, demanding better wages, shorter hours and better working conditions, especially in the tenement manufacturing locations. The strike was supported by the Cigar Makers International Union of America, local chapter 144. ==Background== A cigar is in essence a bundle of rolled cured tobacco leaves. The rolling process can be done by hand, creating a more expensive luxury item, or in a factory. The factory method produces more uniform shapes and is much less expensive. Demand for cigars was high during the 18th and 19th century. The demand created a specialized workforce, first in Cuba and South America. In the mid to late 1800s more workers in the United States were taught in the art of cigar making. Rolling a cigar is a skilled labor; it can take up to one year for an apprentice to master the art and become proficient in rolling a cigar. By the 1840s, tenements had sprung up in larger cities along the east coast of the United States. These were larger rooms within an apartment or house that were exclusively used for work. The tenements usually belonged to the owner of the factory, and apartments were rented to the employees at a high rate. The tenements also produced unhealthy and unsanitary living conditions. By the late 1800s, the art of cigar making had moved to larger factories, making it more efficient for cigar companies in both labor and overall cost. 1863 saw the introduction of a cigar-making mold into the industry. Now relatively unskilled workers could perform the task of rolling a cigar. This led to a large influx of women and young adults into the cigar- making factories. The workers were trained in only one aspect of the cigar- making process. One group broke up the leaves to make the filler, the next group selected the leaves for the rolling process, the next group fed it all into the roller, and the last group finished the product. In 1864, the Cigar Makers International Union of America (CMIU) was formed by several delegates of local cigar maker unions. The delegates came from New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and several other cities. Only those companies making hand-rolled cigars were allowed to join. In 1869, internal fighting caused several members to form a new Union called the United Cigar Makers of New York (UCMNY). Anybody could join this union, whether the cigar was made by hand or with the help of a machine. In 1875, CMIU President George Hurst called for a joint meeting of the two groups in the first issue of the Cigar Makers Official Journal. At this meeting; the UCMNY affiliated with the CMIU and was designated Local 144; its president was Samuel Gompers, and the financial secretary was Adolph Strasser. The CMIU's Local 144 would play a significant role in the formation of the American Federation of Labor. By 1873, the United States' economy took a downturn. Misguided investments into areas that proved to yield less profit than anticipated caused banks to default on loans. In the fall of 1873, customers of banks in New York had difficulty withdrawing their money from their banks. In September, one of the most trusted financial institutions in New York, Jay Cooke & Company, failed and caused a panic that spread eventually beyond New York. ==The strike== The financial crisis of the 1870s caused major strikes across all industries. Most notable the great railroad strike of 1877. In her book “Once a Cigar Maker” Patricia Ann Cooper suggests that the cigar makers may have been inspired by this railroad strike Whatever the inspiration was, by October 1877 over 10,000 women and men had left the factories and tenement rooms and were on strike. They rallied for shorter hours and better wages. The CMIU (Cigar Makers Union of America) supported the strike. The book Woman and child wage-earners in the United States, Volume VIII gives a glimpse into the working conditions in the factories. It states that the working girls were paid by the piece, were of ill health, and in a “low state of morals”, the ill health being caused by the “poisonous odor of the tobacco in an atmosphere filled with the fine particles of the plant. The report states that the average wage for a New York cigar maker in 1877 was about $3 per week. In Salem, Massachusetts the weekly wage was $6. The report also suggests that “much of the prostitution which curses the city is the loathsome fruit of the depravity which dates its commencement at the tobacco factories.\\" The strike caused factory owners to hire Bohemian women and young girls as strike breakers. Some employers who did this admitted openly that they could be hired for about 50% less wages than a man. In the aftermath of the strike, employers found the instruction of young girls in cigar making “extremely effective”. Cigars bearing a band stating: ”These cigars were made by American girls” proved to be very popular. ==Results of the strike== The Daily Alta, a California newspaper, reported in December 1877 that the cigar makers strike didn't make much of a difference. The skilled workers came back, and the Bohemians “who can only produce a very poor cigar” were let go. The newspaper reported that strikes “do not seem to flourish” and that the employers did not suffer much of a loss. Some employers were able to wait out the strike, because they had enough stock on hand. Others simply moved the manufacturing process to a different state. The New York Times, the New-York Tribune, and The New York Sun reported the rough and unfair treatment of the strikers in the streets. The police pushed striking women down, causing a pregnant striker to go into premature labor. They also evicted presumed leaders from their homes as a warning to other tenement workers. The strike ended in February 1878. They had gained “reduced hours of labor, increased employment, higher wages and decreased exposure to the tenement system and its unhealthy products.\\" Employers were glad to get their old hands back”. In August 1881, Gompers, Strasser and several other CMIU delegates met with representatives from other trade unions in Terre Haute, Indiana, to discuss the possibility of uniting into a single union. In November 1881, they met in Pittsburgh and formed the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States of America and Canada. It held five annual conventions. In 1886, it merged with the American Federation of Labor, and Gompers was elected President. In 1891 George W. Perkins was elected president of the CMIU, a post he would hold until 1927. In response, U.S. tobacco companies producing low- priced (5-cent) cigars continued the practice of hiring and training female cigar workers in preference to men, believing that women \\"don't drink\\" and were more reliable, more careful in their work, and more easily managed.Lerman, N. (ed.) Gender and Technology: A Reader, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, (2003),pp. 212-214 The exclusionary attitudes of male union members to females joining the unions meant that most female workers were not union members. Additionally, the vast majority of female cigar workers did not smoke cigars, thus saving manufacturers the customary three free cigars per day given to male cigar rollers for their personal consumption. However, the preference for women workers did not solve the problem of increasing labor and tobacco costs, and a rise in the number of strikes by female employees in the low-priced cigar industry after 1910 meant that factory owners could no longer count on the docility of women workers.Lerman, N. (ed.) Gender and Technology: A Reader, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, (2003),pp. 215 In the end, the decisive blow to cigar maker unions came from technology. As early as 1880, continued strikes, walkouts, and the steadily rising costs of labor and tobacco leaf caused U.S. tobacco companies to invest in mechanized methods of producing cigarettes and cigars. The first cigarette rolling machine was introduced in 1880 by James Albert Bonsack, while the cigar-making machine first appeared in 1889.Tilley, N. M.: The Bright-tobacco industry, 1860 - 1929; Arno Press (1972), The Wheeling Intelligencer, A Great Invention, Wheeling, W. VA 25 July 1889, p. 1 As prices of cigarettes and cigars fell, cigar-making unions lost thousands of members; an estimated 56,000 jobs were lost between 1921 and 1935.Lerman, N. (ed.)

A long-term back injury was a persistent problem; fearing permanent damage, he retired from competitive football at the age of 27. He started refereeing in 1997, originally at lower-league level and harbouring little serious ambition of progressing to the highest echelon of football officiating. However, following positive feedback from players he decided to take the role more seriously. He joined the National List of referees in 2008, officiating many important games, including Crawley Town's upset of Bolton in the 2012–13 Football League Cup. In November 2014 he officiated his first Premier League match, between Burnley and Aston Villa. In 2015, he was promoted to the Select Group of Referees, who officiate the matches in the Premier League, replacing long-time referee Chris Foy. In 2016, former referee Keith Hackett suggested that this promotion was \\"a mistake\\". The PGMOL sought to demote Scott at the end of the 2016–17 season after he refereed just eight Premier League matches all season – of the 19 Select Group referees, only Lee Probert refereed fewer matches. However, Scott appealed against his demotion and retained his place for the 2017–18 season. A number of improved performances has led to him to officiate an increased number of matches, with 13 Premier League matches and an EFL League Cup semi-final by the end of January 2018.

From Ireland's entry to the European Union in 1973, the need for locally produced cars to avoid import taxes reduced and since the 1980s, production ended and all cars are now imported. ==History== The Alesbury automobile was exhibited in Dublin in 1907, but manufacture lasted only from then until 1908. Ford Model A with a Cork registration In 1917, Ford opened a plant in Cork, initially for tractor manufacture as Fordson, but from 1921 cars were built as well. The Henry Ford & Son Ltd factory was the first to be purpose built by Ford in Europe, starting its life on the site of an old Cork racecourse. The factory produced a range of models including the Prefect, Escort, Cortina and production ended with the Sierra in 1984. The factory site extended over 18 acres and employed 7,000 people. Motor Distributors started to import Volkswagen Beetles in 1950 packed in crates in what was termed 'completely knocked down' (CKD) form ready to be assembled, and was the first Volkswagen ever built outside Germany. The vehicles were assembled in a former tram depot in Shelbourne Road in Ballsbridge, which is now the premises for Ballsbridge Motors who are still a Volkswagen dealer. Irish-assembled Beetles rose from an output of 46 units in 1950 to 2,155 units in 1952. This necessitated a move in 1955 to a new factory premises on the Naas Road. Assembly of the Beetle continued there until 1980 when production of the car ceased in Europe. Volkswagen vehicle assembly continued in Dublin until the mid-1980s. During the same period, the Volkswagen Transporter van was also assembled. Motor Distributors also assembled Renault in the late 50s early 60s. Fiat had an assembly plant in Summerhill. O'Neill were Dodge agents. Vauxhall cars and Bedford commercials were assembled in Santry by McCairn's Motors. Reg Armstrong of motorbike racing fame, had an assembly plant in Ringsend for NSU and Opel. For a time there was also an Opel assembly plant in Cork, the Republic of Ireland was divided into a north and south sales areas for Opel. The Cork assembler O'Shea also had the Zetor tractor and Skoda car franchise. The Heinkel Kabine was produced for a short period in 1958. The Shamrock was a short-lived car with a short production of only eight cars in the 1960s in Castleblaney, County Monaghan. A large number of British cars were assembled in Ireland from CKD kits from the 1920s to the 1960s up to 1974. Austin cars and commercial models were assembled by Lincoln & Nolan, Morris cars were assembled by the Brittain's Group, who subsequently acquired Lincoln & Nolan. Morris Commercials, MG, Riley and Wolseley cars were assembled by Booth Poole, which was also taken over by Brittains. A Renault R4 GTL built in 1982 in Wexford Thompson Motor Co. built a new factory in Wexford in 1965 where it assembled the Renault 4, with almost 200 employees producing 35 cars a day. It later went on to produce the TMC Costin, a lightweight sports car, from 1983 to 1987. The 1970s Hillman Hunter was assembled in Santry until production ended in 1979. In 1982 Vauxhall models ceased to be sold, with all General Motors cars carrying the Opel badge. ===Buses=== Until the early 1970s CIÉ built its own buses at its Spa Road factory in Dublin, which was taken over by Van Hool McArdle in 1974 but closed in 1978. In 1980 GAC Ireland was established in Shannon, but closed in 1986, leaving the Republic of Ireland needing to import buses thereafter. ==Northern Ireland== The short-lived DeLorean Motor Company operated in Dunmurry, a suburb of Belfast, from 1978 until the company's bankruptcy in 1982. It produced an estimated 9,000 DeLoreans. == Motorsport== The 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup was the first international motorsport event to be held in Ireland. The Irish International Grand Prix was held for only three years from 1929. The Circuit of Ireland Rally is an annual automobile rally, which was first held in 1931 making it the third oldest rally in the world. Mondello Park, Ireland's only international motorsport venue, was established in 1968. ==Passenger car sales== Passenger car sales have varied greatly from a peak of 230,795 in the year 2000 and a Celtic Tiger high of 186,325 in 2007 to a low of 57,453 in the wake of the Irish property crash and the Post-2008 Irish banking crisis.

In 1915, he married Marie, Baroness von Weinbach.Othmar Hackl: Die Bayerische Kriegsakademie (1867–1914). C.H. Beck´sche Verlagsbuchhandlung. München 1989. . p. 584. == Military career  Peacetime career === Having completed his secondary education, Stetten joined the of the Bavarian Army in Dieuze as a Four-year volunteer. On 18 March 1880, he was promoted to Fähnrich and on 29 April 1882 he became Second Lieutenant. Stetten then received training at the Riding School in Munich between 1889 and 1891 and at the Bavarian War Academy in the three years up to 1894. In the meantime, he had been promoted to First Lieutenant on 25 March 1891 and on 4 April 1895 was seconded to the General Staff for a year. For the following three and a half years, Stetten served as the personal aide to Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria. Together, the two undertook extensive travels to the Middle East, India, Japan and China. In this function, on 7 November 1896, Stetten was promoted to Rittmeister. As such, he assumed command of a Squadron of the 2nd Royal Bavarian Chevau-légers \\"Taxis\\" on 6 November 1899, then stationed in Regensburg. Then, on 13 September 1901, Stetten was again assigned to the General Staff of the 2nd Royal Bavarian Division based in Augsburg, and on 28 October 1902 he was promoted to the senior rank of Major. In 1904, Stetten applied for leave of absence and shortly after, he was granted permission to take part in the Russo-Japanese War on the side of the Empire of Japan, where he also fought in the 1905 Battle of Mukden, the most decisive major land battle of the entire conflict. At the time, his participation in the war was even noted by the .http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Direktorium/Stadtarchiv/Chronik/1904.html After the war had ended, Stetten returned to Bavaria on 17 September 1905 and on 17 October of the same year he was appointed Chief of Staff of the I Royal Bavarian Corps. Following his promotion to Oberstleutnant on 15 August 1906, he assumed command of the 2nd Royal Bavarian Heavy Cavalry \\"Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria\\" on 12 July 1908. This was a heavy cavalry regiment with its peacetime location at Landshut. Precisely one month later, on 12 August 1908, Stetten was promoted to Colonel. On 26 March 1909, he was appointed commander of the and a year later of the . After his promotion to Generalmajor on 16 October 1911, Stetten became Undersecretary in the recently founded Bavarian Ministry of War and at the same time was appointed , thus becoming a close advisor of Otto of Bavaria. Between 18 March 1913 and 1 August 1914 he further served as inspector of the Bavarian Cavalry. In this function, Stetten directly reported to the German Emperor Wilhelm II. On 17 December 1913, he was promoted to Generalleutnant. === Wartime career === At the outbreak of the First World War, Stetten was appointed the new commander of the Bavarian Cavalry Division, a key tactical formation of the German 6th Army employed on the Western Front. On 11 August 1914, the division was already involved in combat operations near Lagarde. Although the Uhlans of the division lost 235 soldiers, the village of Lagarde was successfully taken by assault. As a result, the division was able to capture a French flag, eleven units of heavy weaponry, six machine guns and 1400 prisoners. Perhaps most importantly, Stetten could seize documents from a fallen Brigadier general revealing crucial information about the French plan of action for Lorraine. The encounter at Lagarde was the last successful large-scale cavalry attack on the Western Front. In October, the division was engaged in the border region of northern France and Belgium and already managed to advance on Hazebrouck, when it had to be taken back because of the advance of British troops. On 11 October 1914, Stetten was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph. On 5 November 1914, he was assigned to the temporary command of the II Royal Bavarian Corps to deputize for General Karl Ritter von Martini. Five days later, on 10 November 1914, the Corps managed to capture Sint-Elooi during the First Battle of Ypres. During the Battle of the Somme, some positions of the 3rd Royal Bavarian Division were overrun by the enemy. At the same time, the 4th Royal Bavarian Division was able to decelerate the Allied Capture of Martinpuich with machine gun fire. For his leadership, Stetten was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 22 September 1916. On 5 January 1917, Stetten officially took over the Corps as Commanding General (CG) and was promoted to General of the Cavalry. At this time he commanded the 3rd Royal Bavarian Division under Generalleutnant Karl von Wenninger and the 4th Royal Bavarian Division under Generalmajor Prince Franz of Bavaria. During the Battle of Passchendaele, the Corps was assigned to the southern section of the front of the 4th Army as group \\"Lille\\" and was able to hold its positions. On the morning of 21 May 1917, the British Second Army initiated the Battle of Messines (1917) with a massive bombardment with over 2,000 canons. Although destroying the majority of Germany's defence facilities in this sector, the bombardment also warned Stetten of a potential imminent large-scale attack. The kind of attack, however, had not been foreseen by Stetten and his staff. The British began their attack on 7 June with the detonation of 19 mines they had deployed below the German front line. At the time, the detonation was the loudest sound so far created by humans and still is one of the largest non- nuclear explosions of all times. The explosion immediately killed up to 10,000 of Stetten's soldiers belonging to the 3rd Royal Bavarian Division. Using barrage, toxic gas and 72 tanks, British units managed to make extensive advances into the German defence lines and capture thousands of German soldiers. Without doubt, the Battle of Messines (1917) was one of the most successful Allied advances of World War I and Stetten's greatest defeat. For the Battle of the Lys (1918), Stetten was assigned the central attacking position. Furthermore, his task force also included the 10th Ersatz-Division, the 32nd Division and the 38th Division. The right wing of Stetten's formation succeeded in capturing the forest of Grenier and the village of Fleurbaix, while also establishing access to the Lys river at Bac St. Maur. This area could then be used by other units to cross the river when parts of his units were still engaged in heavy fighting at Pont Mortier. The Corps then further advanced, culminating in the capture of the city of Armentières. The successes of this battle outweighed the 1917 losses in Flanders and created a basis for further advancements. The Allies had to take heavy losses in the form of 20,000 prisoners, 400 canons and thousands of machine guns. Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen replaced Stetten on 18 April 1918. He retired from active service on 12 May 1918. At the same time, Ludwig III of Bavaria awarded him the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph to honour his achievements. The 3rd Royal Bavarian Division and the 4th Royal Bavarian Division, both de facto under Stetten's command since the end of 1914, were recognized as outstanding units by the Allies. Regarding the 3rd Royal Bavarian Division, Allied intelligence rated the division as one of the best German divisions.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919, (1920), pp. 80-82.

It is notable as the most serious and highly publicized agricultural labor disturbance in Washington history and as a brief revitalization of the Industrial Workers of the World in the region. ==Background== Since 1916, the Yakima Valley had felt the presence of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or Wobblies), which positioned itself in conflict with local authorities and business interests. The meeting hall opened by the IWW in Yakima during the fall of that year was promptly raided by local police, who arrested its inhabitants, closed the building, and denied Wobblies the right to hold the street meetings which they regarded as essential to their organizational effort among the harvest workers flooding into the valley. The Yakima strikes began with hop pickers in the Yakima Valley. The demands of the hop pickers were not of anything uncommon during the 1930s, with striking for regular eight-hour work days, the end of child labor in the yards, and a minimum wage of 35 cents per hour for men and women alike. At the time, the current rate for common labor was 10 to 12 cents an hour, with hop farmers claiming that they could not pay any more than 12 ½ cents per hour for labor due to lack of profit they made in sales. In 1932, Yakima Valley hops sold for 11 to 14 cents a pound. Then, effective 7 April 1933, Congress legalized 3.2 percent beer and wine. States rapidly moved to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment. The effect of these events on hop prices was dramatic: in April and May, Valley papers reported sales of the remaining uncommitted 1932 crops at 40 to 50 cents; the Yakima Morning Herald for nearly a month showed prices up to 75 cents per pound. The forthcoming crop for 1933 commanded 20 to 30 cents. Three- and four-year contracts were being signed for 18 to 25 cents. On the second day of the strike, the Yakima County Sheriff called the Washington State Patrol to send aid in which resulted in twenty-two officers coming to the aid of the Yakima County Sheriff's office by the next morning. Although eight picketers were arrested, it did not discourage picketers from continuing their activities. The IWW attorney had contacted the hop growers to see if he could bring about a peaceful settlement to the strike, but the hop growers never responded to the attorney. The strike had fizzled out with little success when matched against the hop growers, sheriffs, and state patrolmen, especially with the Yakima Chamber of Commerce giving the law enforcement and business owners' their support. In order to ensure that peace was maintained on the hop farms, Chief Criminal Deputy H.T. \\"Army\\" Armstrong persuaded local growers to enforce a \\"night hop patrol\\" in which at least six men would be on patrol at all times during the harvest in order to protect the fields from sabotage. ==Timeline== The Yakima valley was an important hops and apple district; many men would travel to the valley during the summer seeking work. After the men were laid off due to being transient workers, they became provoked to strike in regards to the lack of work offered, in which farmers responded by creating vigilante bands around the orchards. On August 14, several dozen men assembled at the Sunnyside Canal Bridge near the lower valley community of Sawyer. Some entered the orchard of Anna Mitchell where they talked to peach pickers about wages. While some protestors were reaching out to the pickers working at the orchard farms, others held their position on the bridge to try to dissuade the pickers from crossing the bridge to work for the farmers on the north side of the canal. With word spreading quickly of the protestors at the bridge, farmers gathered in order to out-number the strikers. Both sides had armed themselves with homemade clubs or tree limbs. The protest turned physical when protestors refused to remove themselves from the bridge. Farmers banded together to throw protestors over the bridge in to the canal to \\"cool them off\\" in order to calm down the protestors. Seeing as the farmers were well- organized and prepared for strikes, along with having the county sheriffs and state patrolmen coming to their aid, the protests of 15 and 16 August were a complete failure. The IWW and the pickers reached the peak of their strike on 23 August 1933 when several hundred workers gathered in Selah, elected a strike committee of seven members, and demanded an eight-hour day plus 50 cents an hour. They also voted for a strike at eleven o'clock the next day. In the early morning hours of August 24, about twenty picketers gathered at the Selah ranch and sixty at another, but local farmers and sheriffs patrolled the area in order to keep the pear harvest in operation. At about 11:00 am, a group of sixty to one hundred picketers gathered at the large Congdon Orchards ranch, three miles west of Yakima, where pears were being picked. The men carried signs which advocated striking and discouraged \\"scabbing.\\" Two sheriff deputies were called, and they told the pickets to move on. The picketers left the orchard, some to continue to picketing along the road and others to gather at the grassy and tree-shaded triangle of land in the middle of the intersection of what is today Nob Hill and 64th avenues. Farmers within a ten- mile radius started calling other farmers to let them know about the picketing that had taken place and to rally up farmers to resist the pickers. The farmers began to walk the picketers still hanging around the orchards towards the town, specifically \\"The Triangle\\". Once the picketers were in that area, the farmers insisted that Triangle was private property and demanded that the workers immediately vacate it. The strikers complied, moving on to the highway. Yet, as soon as they did so, the farmers voiced an object to their being congregated on public property. Although it is not clear who struck the first blows, apparently several farmers stepped forward and told the picketers to move out of the area. There was a brief discussion, then violence broke out. Men went down almost immediately. The bloody altercation involved 250 vigilantes and 100 picketers; of those 100 picketers, 61 workers were taken to the county jail. ==Aftermath== Bullpen used to imprison striking farmworkers The strike was broken up on the night of August 24 due to the Washington National Guard breaking up a protest meeting with tear gas. As well, public assemblies were banned and highways and trains were searched for transients. National Guardsmen destroyed all the transient camps and hobo jungles in the vicinity. A public stockade of heavy timbers and barbed wire was erected to hold the prisoners awaiting trial. On two occasions, local vigilante committees seized prisoners as they were released, took them miles into the country, and beat them; once, the vigilantes tarred and feathered their victims and put linoleum cement in their shoes before freeing them. The prisoners were charged with criminal syndicalism, later changed to vagrancy. At the trial on December 17, 1933, twelve men eventually pleaded guilty to vagrancy and agreed not to take civil action against the county, while non- resident Wobblies promised to leave the county for at least one year; in return, Yakima authorities dropped all other charges. The Yakima repression \\"utterly smashed\\" the strike and agricultural unionism in the Valley, but the wooden stockade remained on the county courthouse grounds until 1943 as a \\"silent reminder to future malcontents that the spirit of 1933 remained alive in the region\\". ==References== Category:Yakima, Washington Yakima Valley Category:Agriculture and forestry labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor disputes in Washington (state) Category:1933 in Washington (state) Category:Labor disputes led by the Industrial Workers of the World Category:Industrial Workers of the World in Washington (state) ","title":"1933 Yakima Valley strike"},{"id":"46868434","text":"Arthur Savile (20 December 1819 – 23 April 1870) was an English clergyman and a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and other amateur teams between 1839 and 1841. He was born at Methley in Yorkshire and died at Fowlmere in Cambridgeshire. Savile was the sixth son of John Savile, 3rd Earl of Mexborough, and of his wife Anne, who was the daughter of Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke. Throughout his life, he was styled as \\"The Honourable Arthur Savile\\". He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Savile was a middle-order batsman, and he appears not to have bowled, though he played one first-class match for a team called the \\"Fast Bowlers\\" in 1841 and in any case records from his time as a cricketer are incomplete. He played three times from 1836 to 1838 for Eton in the annual Eton v Harrow cricket match before going to Cambridge University in 1839. He was not successful in first-class cricket. In his first match for Cambridge University, he scored 14 not out in the first innings of the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but that remained his highest score, and in his only other appearance for the University side, in the University Match against Oxford University in 1840, he scored just 3 and 1. Three matches for MCC produced just 11 runs in four innings, while he failed to score in either innings of his other first-class game. Savile graduated from Cambridge University in 1841 and was ordained as a deacon and then as a priest within the Church of England from 1844 to his death. From 1843 to 1847 he was curate at three different churches: St Clement Danes in London, St Nicholas' Church in Warwick, and then in the parish of Monks Kirby with Withybrook in north Warwickshire. In 1847 he was appointed vicar at Ashby Magna in Leicestershire and in 1850 he moved to be vicar at Fowlmere in Cambridgeshire, where he remained until his death, aged 50. Savile married Lucy Neville, daughter of Richard Griffin, 3rd Baron Braybrooke, in 1852 and they had eight daughters and two sons. His death was reported as being sudden: \\"after a few hours' illness, of acute inflammation of the windpipe\\". ==References== Category:1819 births Category:1870 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Fast v Slow cricketers Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Clergy from Leeds Category:People from Fowlmere Category:Cricketers from Leeds Category:People from Methley ","title":"Arthur Savile"},{"id":"46868445","text":"Marlène Talih is a Lebanese beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Lebanon 1966.

It causes verticillium wilt in some plant species, particularly Ailanthus altissima. The fungus produces a resting mycelium characterized by brown- pigmented hyphae. It is most closely related to V. albo-atrum and V. alfalfae. Common hop plants showing foliar symptoms of Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium albo-atrum on a field at Oregon, USA. Common hop plants showing foliar symptoms of Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium albo-atrum on a field at Oregon, USA. == Description == It is not possible to differentiate V. nonalfalfae and V. alfalfae from V. albo-atrum consistently using only morphological features. Verticillium albo-atrum may be found in co-infections with V. nonalfalfae on some hosts. The hyphae penetrate the root epidermal cells of hosts and enter the xylem. == Host and symptoms == Verticillium nonalfalfae has a wide host range including hops, kiwifruit, spinach, solanaceous plants like eggplants and potatoes, and tree of heaven (A. altissima). Systemic infections appear on most hosts showing vascular wilts caused by xylem blockage. Additional symptoms including vascular discoloration and defoliation show almost exclusively on A. altissima. V. nonalfalfae tends not to infect non-target plants. In contrast with V. alfafae, it does not infect alfalfa. === Impact on hops === One important host of V. nonalfalfae is hops, with infections found both in the United States and most places around the world.. The symptoms of hosts infected by V. nonalfalfae on hops are categorized into two pathotypes: mild and lethal. Mild pathotypes primarily cause symptoms of curling and leaf tissue death. Hops infected by V. nonalfalfae with the mild pathotype generally can survive the infection. For the lethal pathotype of V. nonalfalfae on hops, hosts suffer from rapid weakening that ultimately leads to death. The lethal form was discovered in hops in the 1940s in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe later. Two pathotypes share similar peroxidase, which are thought to be contribute to their pathogenicity. == Disease cycle == The disease cycle of Verticillium nonalfalfae is similar to that of other members of the genus. V. nonalfalfae overwinters by forming a resting mycelium in the soil. However, unlike V. dahliae, for example, it does not produce microsclerotia. Verticillium nonalfalfae infects in the spring via conidia in the soil; conidia are borne on conidiophores. It has been found that intraspecific grafting enhances V. nonalfalfae’s dispersal of conidia, that is, conidia from diseased roots can be transported to healthy root tissues. Conidia can be transmitted through mechanical dispersal, whereby the conidia become attached to cutting tools. In the case of hops, the fungus can spread during soil cultivation, via plantings from infested yards, and through soil moved by equipment and workers. Long- distance transportation of conidia involves insects such as ambrosia beetles, which are thought to be critical in creating regional outbreaks of wilting in Ailanthus. == Biological control of tree of heaven == Another important host of V. nonalfalfae is Ailanthus altissima, also known as tree of heaven. This species of Ailanthus was introduced in the northeastern United States from the 1790s, and is now a forest management problem in 40 of the 48 contiguous states. Spreading widely and quickly, it is considered to be an Invasive species. V. nonalfalfae is being studied as a biological control of A. altissima. Symptoms of verticillium wilt on tree of heaven appear quickly after inoculation, according to studies. Joanne Rebbeck, a Research Scientist and Timothy Fox, a Biological Research Technician, both from the USDA Forest Service Northern Research Station, inoculate Ailanthus trees with Verticillium nonalfalfae to evaluate its effectiveness as a biological control.

This was the third career win for Martin Truex Jr. and first since the 2013 Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway. It was the second win for Furniture Row Racing and first since the 2011 Showtime Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway. Despite the win, he left Pocono trailing Kevin Harvick by 39 points in the drivers standings. Chevrolet left with a 59-point lead over Ford in the manufacturer standings. The Axalta \\"We Paint Winners\\" 400 was carried by Fox Sports on the cable/satellite Fox Sports 1 network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the Motor Racing Network and Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. ==ReportBackground=== Pocono Raceway, the track where the race was held. Pocono Raceway (formerly Pocono International Raceway) also known as the Tricky Triangle, is a superspeedway located in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania at Long Pond. It is the site of two annual NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races held just weeks apart in June and August, and one NASCAR Camping World Truck Series event in August. Since 2013, the track is also host to a Verizon IndyCar Series race. Pocono is one of a very few NASCAR tracks not owned by either Speedway Motorsports, Inc. or International Speedway Corporation, the dominant track owners in NASCAR. It is run by the Igdalsky siblings Brandon, Nicholas, and sister Ashley, and cousins Joseph IV and Chase Mattioli, all of whom are third-generation members of the family- owned Mattco Inc, started by Joseph II and Rose Mattioli. Mattco also owns South Boston Speedway in South Boston, Virginia. Outside of the NASCAR races, Pocono is used throughout the year by Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) and motorcycle clubs as well as racing schools. The triangular oval also has three separate infield sections of racetrack – North Course, East Course and South Course. Each of these infield sections use a separate portion of the tri-oval to complete the track. During regular non-race weekends, multiple clubs can use the track by running on different infield sections. Also some of the infield sections can be run in either direction, or multiple infield sections can be put together – such as running the North Course and the South Course and using the tri-oval to connect the two. Kevin Harvick entered Pocono with a 44-point lead over Martin Truex Jr. following a runner-up finish at Dover. Jimmie Johnson and Joey Logano entered 76 back. Dale Earnhardt Jr. entered 84 back. Pit crew apparel Beginning this weekend, all pit crew members were required to wear specially made gloves, head socks and underwear that are certified by the SFI Foundation. Previously, only the gas can man was required to wear all these items. Entry list The entry list for the Axalta \\"We Paint Winners\\" 400 was released on Monday, June 1 at 4:45 p.m. Eastern time. Forty-three cars were entered for the race. This was the first race this season in which nobody failed to qualify for the race. The two driver changes from the previous race to this race were the No. 32 Go FAS Racing Ford that was driven by Travis Kvapil and the No. 33 Hillman-Circle Sport LLC Chevrolet that was driven by Ty Dillon. {  {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! !

Eighty- five minutes into the session, Tony Stewart got loose exiting turn 2, slid down and crashed into the tire barrier on the inside wall. Stewart told Fox Sports 1, “I was already past the bump (from the tunnel turn), got loose on the exit of it and I couldn’t catch it. So, driver error.” The damage sustained forced the team to roll out their backup car. Because this change took place prior to qualifying, he won't be required to start the race from the rear of the field. {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! Pos ! ! Driver ! Team ! Manufacturer !

Kurt Busch won the pole with a time of 50.676 and a speed of . “Wow, what a day, today,” Busch said. “I feel like there are six corners out there as hard as I was working; corner entry, corner exit. The car was just off-balance, especially with the new bumps in Turn 2. And then we got way loose. I think we were 30th in practice. And we had to drop back and punt. (Danica Patrick’s crew chief) Daniel Knost, his set-up, is what we reverted to from last year when we qualified outside pole. So, that’s what it’s all about, team communication and working hard together as a group.” “Yeah, I was just disappointed that we didn’t have great speed,” Brad Keselowski said after qualifying seventh. “I’m not really sure why, but that’s just part of it.” Only seven drivers posted a time in the final round after Denny Hamlin spun out in turn 1. The session was stopped with 39 seconds remaining. Because no one would be able to make it around in the remaining time to start a qualifying lap, the session was concluded. “The circumstances though, I’d like to see everybody finish their lap,” Busch said. “I always thought they should freeze the time when somebody spins. That way everybody still gets to get back out there and make their lap.\\" Questions were raised over Denny Hamlin getting placed ahead of the other four drivers that didn't post a time in the third round since his spin caused the session to end prematurely. In his weekly appearance on the Sirius XM NASCAR Radio program The Morning Drive the Tuesday after the race, NASCAR Executive Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer Steve O'Donnell discussed with Mike Bagley and Pete Pistone about changing that particular policy. ===Qualifying results=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - !

He didn't lead the first lap, however, as Carl Edwards passed him in turn 1. Jeff Gordon puled to within a car length of him, but began pulling away from the field after a few laps. By lap 14, Martin Truex Jr. and Kevin Harvick reeled in Edwards. After a few attempts at him, Truex made the pass on Edwards and took the lead on lap 16. Brad Keselowski, running seventh, made an unscheduled stop on lap 21. He rejoined the race 37th. This triggered a wave of cars making this first pit stops of the race. Matt Kenseth, Joey Logano and Paul Menard were tagged for speeding on pit road. Kenseth and Logano were forced to serve a drive-through penalty. Menard was forced to serve a stop-go penalty for speeding in all sections after his pit box. He had to come a second time for speeding again. He cut down his left-front tire and came down pit road for a third time. Truex, Jr. made his first pit stop on lap 29 and handed the lead to Edwards. Edwards pitted on lap 30 and handed the lead to Kasey Kahne, who made his stop on lap 32. Then the lead was given back to Kevin Harvick. Second quarter Debris on the front stretch brought out the first caution on lap 49. The debris was a piece of the splitter from Menard's car. Truex exited pit road with the lead by taking just two tires. The race restarted on lap 55. Truex's lead over Harvick began to shrink by lap 65. The second caution flew on lap 69 when Ricky Stenhouse Jr., going into the tunnel turn, dove into the corner to try passing Casey Mears, got loose, overcorrected, and slammed the wall. \\"The brakes were getting hot and we were having to pump them up,\\" Stenhouse said. \\"They kind of maintained the first run and everything felt OK. I was still having to pump it up and on that last run I was having to pump them up three or four times, and then when the 13 (Mears) got into us down the back straightaway I was too busy catching it and too busy being sideways, and then once I finally caught it I didn't have time to pump up the brakes and the brakes went to the floor. Then I was just trying to make it through the corner without hitting anybody else and tried to keep it out of the wall, but didn't quite do it.\\" Harvick chose not to pit, so he had the lead under the caution. ===Second half=== Halfway The race restarted on lap 74. The third caution of the race flew on lap 88 when Jimmie Johnson cut down his left-front tire in turn 2. He was able to get his car down to the bottom of the track. Austin Dillon chose not to pit under the caution, so he assumed the lead. The race restarted with on lap 93. Gordon passed Dillon going into turn 1 and took the lead. The fourth caution flew the same lap when Alex Bowman, going into turn 3, got turned by Brett Moffitt and spun. Gordon pitted and handed the lead to Martin Truex Jr. The race restarted on lap 97. The fifth caution of the race flew with 39 laps to go for a single car wreck in turn 1. Going into 1, Sam Hornish Jr. cut a tire and slammed the wall hard. Fourth quarter Martin Truex Jr., seen here at the 2015 Daytona 500, snapped a 69 race winless drought and scored the third victory of his career at Pocono. The race restarted with 35 laps to go. The sixth caution of the race flew with 32 laps to go for a single car wreck in turn 1. As Moffitt was riding the high line in 1, Brad Keselowski hit him in the left rear corner and sent the No. 34 car spinning. Tony Stewart was tagged for an uncontrolled tire and was forced to restart the race from the rear of the field. The race restarted with 27 laps to go. The seventh caution of the race flew for a single car wreck in turn 1. After making hard contact with the wall exiting turn 4, Danica Patrick cut down the right-rear tire and backed into the turn 1 wall. \\"I was trying the best I could to get back into the top-10, and the car just hopped the wall,\\" Patrick said. \\"We were having a great race, and I hate that wrecked our day.” The race restarted with 21 laps to go. The eighth caution of the race flew with 20 laps to go for a single car wreck in turn 1. Going through the corner, A. J. Allmendinger got loose, drifted up the track, tapped Ryan Newman and sent him right into the wall. The race restarted with 16 laps to go. Patrick spun out exiting turn 3, but because she spun into pit road, the race remained green. Truex Jr. pulled away from the field to snap a 69 race winless streak. ===Post-race=== Post-race comments “It feels unbelievable,” Truex said. “I knew we were going to get one. Everyone kept asking when are you going to get one. I knew we were going to win. I knew we had the team and what it took. I feel that I’m on Cloud Nine right now. The last year and a half have been pretty tough, but this feels real good. It never gets any better than this. It takes time to heal things especially with what Sherry and I went through. This just kind of makes you forget all about it. Tomorrow we are still going back to normal life and we always try to remember that and be ourselves and remember why we are here. And how thankful we are to be here and how lucky we are to be doing this. I just feel super blessed to be with this group of guys.” “I think everybody is probably frustrated that we didn't win, but I think it's frustrated in a good way,” Harvick said of his latest second-place finish on Sunday. “It's very rare that you can come to the racetrack and be in those positions every week. I think when you look at the just like today, we were literally coming to pit road when the caution flag flew and never really made up those ten spots that we lost, and struggled on the restarts to get going. I think as you look at the situations, I think second is better than tenth.” Jimmie Johnson rallied from a cut tire and brushing the wall to finish third. “Today we really didn't have pace for the 78 (Truex Jr.) or the 4 (Harvick), so we've got to get to work there,” Johnson said. “With the damaged car we ran third, missing half the splitter and the right side knocked in, some hard racing on one of those restarts off Turn 3. To get a good result, we overcame a lot today, having to deal with a flat tire, the damage to the car, and then I got to third. We'll take it. Scrappy day for us, but not the end of the world, either.” Jimmie Johnson had some words of congrats for the race winner. \\"He's had more to overcome personally and professionally than probably anybody sitting in that seat right now,\\" Johnson said. \\"For him to still walk in the garage every week with a smile on his face, climb in the car, be the great guy he is, I think speak volumes. It's a very popular win.\\" Race results {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! Pos ! Grid ! ! Driver ! Team ! Manufacturer ! !

It took place on 28 April 1792 during the War of the First Coalition and was a French victory. ==Course== On 20 April 1792, France declared war on the king of Bohemia and Hungary, who five days earlier had given Louis XVI of France an ultimatum regarding the possessionary princes of the Alsace. Whole French regiments such as the Régiment de Royal-Allemand cavalerie and the Hussards de Saxe had emigrated or switched sides.Victoires, conquêtes, désastres, revers et guerres civiles des Français, volume 7 However, the coalition forces were slow to press their advantage and the armée du Rhin's commander Nicolas Luckner decided to attack the stronghold at Porrentruy to prevent an invasion. He had a camp of 12,000 men at far end of the Basse-Alsace, between Lauterbourg, Landau and Weissembourg. Luckner commanded Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine to advance into Porrentruy province, which belonged to the prince-bishop of Basel. This would avoid this portion of the French frontier being invaded. At the head of 2,000 men, with colonel Charles Grangier de La Ferriere, commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, as his second-in-command and followed by three infantry battalions, an artillery company and around 300 dragoons, Custine marched into the province and demanded Porrentruy's surrender. It had a garrison of 400 Austrians, but the prince-bishop did not want to support a siege and marched the garrison away to Bienne. Custine thus captured Porrentruy without a fight and was able to dig in on the Laumont mountain to defend the valleys of Fribourg, Bienne, Basel and Solothurn. ==Bibliography== *Victoires, conquêtes, désastres, revers et guerres civiles des Français, volume 7 ==References== Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Conflicts in 1792 Category:1792 in France Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:1792 in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Capture of Porrentruy"},{"id":"46868582","text":"Alexander Yakovlevich Bulgakov (; 15 November 178117 April 1863) was a Russian diplomat, senator, and postal administrator. == Biography == Alexander Bulgakov was born in 1781 in Constantinople in the family of a Russian diplomat, Yakov Bulgakov (1743–1809).

He worked as the Superintendent of His Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office from 1937 to 1971. ==Early life== Donald Sadler was born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, on 22 August 1908. He attended the local grammar school where he excelled in mathematics. He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge and received a first-class degree in 1929. Sadler developed an interest in celestial mechanics during his studies at Cambridge. He contributed to the work of the Computing Section of the British Astronomical Association. ==The Nautical Almanac Office== Sadler began work as an assistant at His Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in 1930, working under the direction of the Superintendent, Leslie Comrie, when it was based at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London. Sadler was promoted to Deputy Superintendent of the Office in 1933. Comrie left the Nautical Almanac Office in 1936. A decision was taken to move the Office to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, placing it under the direction of the Astronomer Royal, and Sadler was appointed a Chief Assistant at the observatory. Sadler was appointed Comrie's successor as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac Office in 1937. Sadler was the eighth person to occupy this post since it was created in 1818. Sadler took on the task of consolidating projects begun by Comrie, publishing new tables for use in navigation. The Second World War soon intervened and the Nautical Almanac Office was moved temporarily out of London to the safer environment of Bath. The Office expanded in size temporarily to prepare data for military use. Sadler was awarded the OBE in 1948 in recognition of this work. Sadler supervised the relocation of the Nautical Almanac Office in 1949 from Bath to the new home of the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex. He expanded the use of calculating machines in astronomical calculations. He increased international cooperation in preparing astronomical tables, particularly with the United States Naval Observatory. In 1954 Sadler married his colleague, Flora Sadler (née McBain), in what was described as 'the astronomical romance of the decade'. Donald Sadler oversaw the transfer of the Nautical Almanac Office within the Royal Greenwich Observatory from the control of the Admiralty to the new Science Research Council. ==Scientific societies== Donald Sadler became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1931, and served on the society's council. He acted as a secretary between 1939 and 1947, contributing to sustaining the society's work during the war. He served as the society's president from 1967 to 1969. Sadler contributed to other scientific societies, including the Royal Institute of Navigation, of which he was president. He served as general secretary of the International Astronomical Union (1958–1964), then as vice-president, and president (1968–1970). In 1981, Sadler became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. ==Later life== Donald Sadler retired as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac Office in 1971\\\\. He continued working at the office for a further year, retiring in February 1972. Sadler continued with his activities in the Royal Institute of Navigation. Donald Sadler died at Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, on 24 October 1987. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1987 deaths Category:20th-century astronomers Category:English astronomers Category:English mathematicians Category:Fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society Category:Founding members of the World Cultural Council Category:Presidents of the Royal Astronomical Society ","title":"Donald Sadler"},{"id":"46868589","text":"Anne Duguël is the pen name of Anne Liger-Belair (August 1, 1945 – May 21, 2015), a Belgian francophone author. She writes both children's and adult literature, and has also been known to use the pen names Gudule, Anne Guduël, or Anne Carali. Duguël is known for her fantastique works, which were inspired by the dark side of fairytales and writers such as Jean Ray and Michel de Ghelderode. ==Early life== Duguël was born in Ixelles, Belgium, the only daughter in a family of boys. According to French newspaper Le Monde, she always wanted to be a writer, finishing her first book at the tender age of 5. Raised in a strict Catholic household, Duguël became fascinated with fairytales and dark folk stories. Influenced by Jean Ray, she wrote \\"Le Couvent maudit\\" (\\"The Cursed Convent\\") in sixth grade. Thirty years later, this story became her novel \\"L'Ecole qui n'existait pas\\" (\\"The School That Didn't Exist\\"). ==Career== Duguël studied interior decorating in Brussels before traveling to Lebanon to live with her brother at the age of 19 after a failed romance and the birth of her first child. In Lebanon, she worked as a tailor and journalist. While living there, she met cartoonist Paul Karali, sometimes called Carali, whom she married and had two children with, Olivier and Mélaka. Karali and Duguël left Lebanon for Paris, where she raised their children and continued her work as a journalist, as well as writing comic scenarios for publications such as Charlie Hebdo, Fluide Glacial, and Hara- Kiri. She appeared frequently on French radio program \\"Radio Libertaire,\\" a show dedicated to comic strips. Duguël also started writing stories for French children's magazines at this time. Duguël's first book, \\"Prince Charmant, poil aux dents,\\" was published until 1987. The book was a preview of the fantastique writing style Duguël became known for: Three maids of honor escape a wedding by entering a painting. While there, one of them marries a charming prince who turns out to be a hideous monster. She became a prolific writer, publishing several books a year, exploring topics such as autism, racism, paranoia and homelessness all with a touch of surrealism. Some of her best- known works include \\"La Bibliothecaire,\\" the story of a boy who dislikes reading, befriends a mysterious young woman and aids her in her quest to find a magic grimoire; and \\"Entre chien et louve,\\" the story of an old man who dies and returns to his beloved by inhabiting the body of a dog she adopted. ==Death== News of Duguël's death broke on May 21, 2015, to stunned and saddened reactions from the literary community. Her writing, which she described as, \\"for youth, above all, but for adults a bit as well,\\" is remembered as both creative and emotive, bringing a touch of the bizarre to real-world situations to evoke empathy in the reader. == Novels == * L'École qui n'existait pas (1994) * La Vie à reculons (1994) * La Bibliothécaire (1995) * Après vous, M.de La Fontaine (1995) * L'Envers du décor (1996) * La Fille au chien noir (1998) * J'irai dormir au fond du puits (1998) * L'Amour en chaussettes (1999) * Qui hante la tour morte?

It took place on 29 April 1792 and ended in a French defeat. == Background == In early 1792, as the French Revolution was gradually radicalising, and conservative royalist Armées des Émigrés were forming just across the borders in cities such as Koblenz – readying to invade and reverse the Revolution, tensions rose between France and other European states about the future status of the Bourbon monarchy. The Girondin majority in the Legislative Assembly favoured war, especially with Austria, in order to display the Revolution's strength and defend its achievements (such as the Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789 and the early beginnings of parliamentary democracy) against a possible return to an absolutist Ancien Régime. However, there was a real risk that France would be overwhelmed by foreign forces if a large anti-French coalition were to be formed. Major-general Charles François Dumouriez was appointed to Minister of Foreign Affairs in March 1792, and by mid-April had managed to obtain the neutrality of all European great powers except Austria and Prussia through cunning diplomacy. Meanwhile, he organised plans to incite local insurrection in the Austrian Netherlands by cooperating with the Committee of United Belgians and Liégois, who represented remnants of the rebel armies formed during the recently failed anti-Austrian Brabant Revolution and Liège Revolution (August 1789 – January 1791). == Invasion == Marshal Rochambeau. Finally, France declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792. Dumouriez planned to defeat the Austrian army within 15 days to achieve a successful quick victory. From Dunkirk to Strasbourg, the French army's northern frontier comprised 164,000 soldiers, under the leadership of general Lafayette (targets: from Givet to Namur and Liège), marshal Luckner (targets: Flemish cities such as Menen and Kortrijk) and marshal Rochambeau (targets: Quiévrain, Mons and Brussels). Rochambeau's subordinate general Biron and maréchal du camp Théobald Dillon would lead the invasion. The French army was plagued by troubles: both Lafayette and Rochambeau were convinced royalists, and had doubts about the republican minister's intentions as well as the feasibility of his strategies; the troops were poorly equipped, many of them untrained volunteers, and they distrusted their aristocratic officers; and finally, queen Marie Antoinette (herself an Austrian, and rightfully fearing that further republican radicalisation would cost her life) secretly passed on this and later war plans to the Austrian government in Brussels, with king Louis' approval. During Biron's attempts to capture Quiévrain and Mons, Dillon made a feint towards Tournai; his force was intended as a decoy to distract the Austrians. Leaving Lille with 10 squadrons, 6 battalions and 6 guns, he met the Austrian major-general Louis-François de Civalart, encamped with 3,000 men on the heights above Marquain.Victoires, conquêtes, désastres, revers et guerres civiles des Français, volume 7 Austrian skirmishers attacked the French vanguard so heavily that the French realized Civalart wished to bring on a pitched battle, whereas Dillon had orders to avoid one. == Battle == Galic Perfidy, or the National Troops Attachment to their General after their Defeat at Tournay Seeing the enemy coming down to meet him and unsure of his own troops (who had frequently been insubordinate on the march from Lille), Dillon obeyed his orders and commanded a retreat. At the first sign of a French withdrawal, the Austrians fired their guns several times despite being out of range, with none of their shots even reaching Dillon's rearguard. Despite the French troops' fear of their own generals, the cavalry squadrons covering the retreat panicked just as at Quiévrain. Hearing the guns, they rushed into their own infantry shouting \\"Sauve qui peut, nous sommes trahis\\" (\\"Every man for himself, we are betrayed\\"). This spread confusion in the French force, which fled in disorder across Baisieux towards Lille, leaving behind its baggage, munitions and all but 2 guns. Dillon tried in vain to rally his retreating troops before the enemy could attack and was shot by one of his own troops. The force re-formed level with the Fives gate, with a mixture of soldiers from different regiments forming a garrison. Dillon's second-in-command, the engineer colonel Pierre-François Berthois, was stopped by the soldiers, hung from one of the battlements and fired him and 3 or 4 prisoners from a gun. Wounded, Dillon was shot in a cart and bayonetted. His body was tied to the cart and dragged through the streets as far as the Grand Place, where it was thrown on a fire, made up of signs from several neighbouring shops. Dillon's cousin Arthur complained to the Assembly and his murderers were punished and his widow granted a pension to raise her children. == Aftermath == When both his subordinates Dillon and Biron failed in their missions, Rochambeau resigned. On 30 April, Lafayette heard of the defeats and Rochambeau's resignation, cancelled his assault on Namur and Liège as well and awaited new orders from Paris. The Belgian-Liégois Committee was disappointed and felt betrayed, claiming Lafayette could have easily taken both cities by sheer superior numbers. The complete failure of the Belgian invasion was a great humiliation for the members of the Legislative Assembly, where the leftist Jacobins blamed the Girondins and both accused the royal family of conspiring with the Austrian and Prussian enemy, which was true. It further bolstered radical views that the royals undermined the Revolution's success, and that only republicanism could save it. == Bibliography == * Victoires, conquêtes, désastres, revers et guerres civiles des Français, volume 7 == References == Marquain Category:Conflicts in 1792 Category:1792 in France Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Battles in Wallonia Battle of Marquain ","title":"Battle of Marquain"},{"id":"46868769","text":"Brickellia paniculata is a Mesoamerican species of flowering plants in the daisy family.

It was at that time, in the 1920s, that he became a close disciple of Izz ad- Din al-Qassam. Al-Qassam had been organizing the peasants and urban dwellers of northern Palestine into an armed movement. Abu Ibrahim advocated that the movement should have commenced a revolt against the British colonial authorities in Palestine immediately in the wake of the 1929 riots so as not to allow the British an opportunity to further clamp down and weaken the Palestinian community. Following al-Qassam's death in 1935, he and other deputies of al-Qassam, such as Farhan al-Sa'di and Attiyah Abu Awad, took command of rebel bands. Together, they spearheaded the 1936 revolt. Abu Ibrahim was among the leading commanders of Palestinian rebels in the Upper Galilee. His unit, which drew Qassamiyun from the villages between Haifa and Saffuriya, called themselves \\"al-Darawish\\", which translates as \\"the Dervishes\\". In October 1937, a headquarters for the revolt was set up in Damascus, Syria, known as the Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine, Abu Ibrahim became the sole actual rebel commander serving on the committee. Abu Ibrahim was adept at raising funds and procuring weapons for the armed struggle.Barr, 2012, p. 164. Although he based himself in Damascus, he would regularly enter Palestine to assess his group's situation and pay them their stipends. In 1938, he personally led an assault against the Jewish neighborhoods of Tiberias, which resulted in the deaths of 19 Jewish residents. According to contemporary accounts of some Palestinians, Abu Ibrahim also oversaw the campaign to eliminate Palestinian individuals who cooperated with the British authorities in the Galilee. Unlike many of his comrades, Abu Ibrahim survived the revolt and was reportedly alive as of 1972. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Arab people in British Palestine Category:Rebel commanders of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Category:People from Haifa Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir"},{"id":"46868791","text":"Andrew William Hill (born c. 1950) is an American former basketball player and current author and motivational speaker. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning three national championships in the early 1970s under Coach John Wooden. After a brief career playing professionally overseas, Hill entered the entertainment industry. He became president of two media companies, CBS Productions and Channel One News. He reconnected with Wooden after 25 years, and they co-wrote a best-selling book based on the application of Wooden's coaching principles to the business world. ==Early life== Hill was born and raised in Los Angeles in the Westwood area, and is Jewish.The Final Report of the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, Volume 1, United States President's Commission on Olympic Sports, 1977.Federal Sports Act of 1972 Hearings, Ninety-second Congress, Second Session, on S. 3445, United States Congress, Senate Committee on Commerce, 1973. His father was emotionally detached and abusive. Growing up, Hill watched the UCLA basketball team around town before Pauley Pavilion was built, and dreamed of playing for them and Coach John Wooden. He went to high school at University High in West Los Angeles. A skilled shooter, playing guard on the University High Warriors basketball team Hill was the unanimous pick for Western League Most Valuable Player (MVP) as a senior in 1968, when he was the second-leading scorer in Los Angeles at 27.2 points per game. For the second straight year, he earned first-team All-Los Angeles City honors. He was considered one of the top prospects in the country. ==College career== Hill attended UCLA on a basketball scholarship, and in 1969 averaged 19 points and 8 assists per game and shared MVP honors on the freshman team with Henry Bibby, the squad's leading scorer (26.8). He was selected for Team USA to play in the 1969 Maccabiah Games. However, when he asked UCLA's athletic director J.D. Morgan if he could play in the Games, Morgan replied that if he did so the NCAA would not allow him to play again for UCLA when he returned. Hill won three straight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships as a member of the varsity UCLA Bruins under Wooden. However, the backup guard played sparingly, and took just 99 shots in those three years. UCLA had many talented players during that era, and many of those who ended up being reserves arguably would have started on other teams. Wooden chose not to play Hill much, believing that teammates such as Bibby and Kenny Booker were better players. However, Hill was convinced that his political views and outspoken nature were directly related to his lack of playing time.Yaeger, Wooden 2011, p. 138. He clashed with Wooden over politics and the handling of reserve players, and the coach once suggested that he transfer schools. Given the poor relationship he had with his father, Hill craved for Wooden to be a father figure. Nonetheless, Hill came to feel neglected and believed that Wooden did not like him. He graduated in 1972 thinking he would never see Wooden again. ==Professional basketball career== Hill had a brief stint playing professionally in Israel for Maccabi Ramat Gan. He then returned to the U.S. and coached at Santa Monica College for a few years in Southern California. ==Entertainment industry== He discovered that coaching did not suit him, and entered the entertainment industry when he was 28. He became an accomplished movie and television executive with Columbia Pictures Television, and established his own production company. From 1991 though 1996, Hill was the president of CBS Productions, leading the development and production of programming owned by the network. He oversaw some of the most successful primetime shows of the decade, including Touched by an Angel; Caroline in the City; Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman; Walker, Texas Ranger; Dave's World; and Rescue 911. With other romantic comedy options in the works, CBS' programming department passed on Caroline In the City. However, Hill was convinced it was a hit program, and found a buyer for the show in NBC. It was the first series that NBC had bought from a rival network, as well as the first one that CBS had sold to a competitor. Hill called NBC's decision \\"the most important statement CBS Productions has ever made about our legitimacy in this business.\\" In 1996, Hill asked to be released from his CBS contract to join MCA Inc., but his boss—CBS Entertainment President Leslie Moonves—refused. However, Hill left CBS the following year. From 1997 until 2000, he was president of programming for Channel One News, where he produced award-winning news programming for an audience of eight million American teens. After 25 years had passed since he last saw Wooden, Hill was reminded of his former coach while playing golf. Hill's playing partner advised him to \\"Don't hurry, get your balance\\", which evoked a Wooden maxim of \\"Be quick, but don't hurry.\\" Realizing that the coach's teachings had subconsciously guided his life and career, Hill was inspired to contact Wooden, and they developed a close friendship. \\"Once we were away from basketball, from my thinking I should play more, I could see [Wooden] did care about me,\\" Hill said. He co-wrote Be Quick—But Don't Hurry! Finding Success in the Teachings of a Lifetime with Wooden. The bestseller details how Hill applied his experience as a player under Wooden to achieve success in his career as a television executive. His goal was to demonstrate the relevance of Wooden's coaching style to the business world. The book also delves into his personal relationship with Wooden as his coach and mentor. After publishing the book, Hill became a motivational speaker on leadership and life coaching. ==Honors== In 2016 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. ==Publications== * ==References== Category:Living people Category:American business writers Category:American expatriate basketball people in Israel Category:American media executives Category:American motivational speakers Category:Basketball players at the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players at the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players at the 1972 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from California Category:CBS executives Category:Guards (basketball) Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:UCLA Bruins men's basketball players Category:University High School (Los Angeles) alumni Category:American men's basketball players Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Jewish men's basketball players Category:Jewish American sportspeople Category:Santa Monica Corsairs coaches ","title":"Andy Hill (basketball)"},{"id":"46868811","text":"The Tenth East Asia Summit was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on November 21–22, 2015.

These pathways are crucial for self- tolerance, which prevents the immune system from attacking cells indiscriminately. However, some cancers can protect themselves from attack by stimulating immune checkpoint targets. Inhibitory checkpoint molecules are targets for cancer immunotherapy due to their potential for use in multiple types of cancers. Currently approved checkpoint inhibitors block CTLA4 and PD-1 and PD-L1. For the related basic science discoveries, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo won the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018. == Stimulatory checkpoint molecules == Four stimulatory checkpoint molecules are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily—CD27, CD40, OX40, GITR and CD137. Another two stimulatory checkpoint molecules belongs to the B7-CD28 superfamily—CD28 itself and ICOS. * CD27: This molecule supports antigen-specific expansion of naïve T cells and is vital for the generation of T cell memory. CD27 is also a memory marker of B cells. CD27's activity is governed by the transient availability of its ligand, CD70, on lymphocytes and dendritic cells. CD27 costimulation is known to suppresses Th17 effector cell function. The American biotech company Celldex Therapeutics is working on CDX-1127, an agonistic anti-CD27 monoclonal antibody which in animal models has been shown to be effective in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. * CD28: This molecule is constitutively expressed on almost all human CD4+ T cells and on around half of all CD8 T cells. Binding with its two ligands are CD80 and CD86, expressed on dendritic cells, prompts T cell expansion. CD28 was the target of the TGN1412 'superagonist' which caused severe inflammatory reactions in the first-in-man study in London in March 2006. * CD40: This molecule, found on a variety of immune system cells including antigen presenting cells has CD40L, otherwise known as CD154 and transiently expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ T cells, as its ligand. CD40 signaling is known to ‘license’ dendritic cells to mature and thereby trigger T-cell activation and differentiation. A now-defunct Seattle-based biotechnology company called VLST in-licensed an anti-CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody from Pfizer in 2012. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche acquired this project when VLST was shut down in 2013. * CD122: This molecule, which is the Interleukin-2 receptor beta sub- unit, is known to increase proliferation of CD8+ effector T cells. The American biotechnology company Nektar Therapeutics is working on NKTR-214, a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine Phase I results announced in Nov 2016.Immunotherapy, NKTR-214, Shows Activity Against Solid Tumors in Clinical Trial * CD137: When this molecule, also called 4-1BB, is bound by CD137 ligand, the result is T-cell proliferation. CD137-mediated signaling is also known to protect T cells, and in particular, CD8+ T cells from activation- induced cell death. The German biotech company Pieris Pharmaceuticals has developed an engineered lipocalin that is bi-specific for CD137 and HER2. * OX40: This molecule, also called CD134, has OX40L, or CD252, as its ligand. Like CD27, OX40 promotes the expansion of effector and memory T cells, however it is also noted for its ability to suppress the differentiation and activity of T-regulatory cells, and also for its regulation of cytokine production. OX40's value as a drug target primarily lies in the fact that, being transiently expressed after T-cell receptor engagement, it is only upregulated on the most recently antigen-activated T cells within inflammatory lesions. Anti-OX40 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to have clinical utility in advanced cancer. The pharma company AstraZeneca has three drugs in development targeting OX40: MEDI0562 is a humanised OX40 agonist; MEDI6469, murine OX4 agonist; and MEDI6383, an OX40 agonist * GITR: short for Glucocorticoid- Induced TNFR family Related gene, prompts T cell expansion, including Treg expansion. The ligand for GITR is mainly expressed on antigen presenting cells. Antibodies to GITR have been shown to promote an anti-tumor response through loss of Treg lineage stability. The biotech company TG Therapeutics is working on anti-GITR antibodies * ICOS: This molecule, short for Inducible T-cell costimulator, and also called CD278, is expressed on activated T cells. Its ligand is ICOSL, expressed mainly on B cells and dendritic cells. The molecule seems to be important in T cell effector function. The American biotechnology company Jounce Therapeutics is developing an ICOS agonist. == Inhibitory checkpoint molecules == Cancer Therapy by Inhibition of Negative Immune Regulation (CTLA4, PD1) * A2AR: The Adenosine A2A receptor is regarded as an important checkpoint in cancer therapy because adenosine in the immune microenvironment, leading to the activation of the A2a receptor, is negative immune feedback loop and the tumor microenvironment has relatively high concentrations of adenosine. * B7-H3: also called CD276, was originally understood to be a co-stimulatory molecule but is now regarded as co- inhibitory. The American biotechnology company MacroGenics is working on MGA271 is an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3. B7-H3’s receptors have not yet been identified. * B7-H4: also called VTCN1, is expressed by tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages and plays a role in tumour escape. * BTLA: This molecule, short for B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator and also called CD272, has HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator) as its ligand. Surface expression of BTLA is gradually downregulated during differentiation of human CD8+ T cells from the naive to effector cell phenotype, however tumor-specific human CD8+ T cells express high levels of BTLA. * CTLA-4: short for Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 and also called CD152, is the target of Bristol-Myers Squibb's melanoma drug Yervoy, which gained FDA approval in March 2011. Expression of CTLA-4 on Treg cells serves to control T cell proliferation. * IDO: short for Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, is a tryptophan catabolic enzyme with immune-inhibitory properties. Another important molecule is TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. IDO is known to suppress T and NK cells, generate and activate Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and promote tumour angiogenesis. * KIR: short for Killer- cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor, is a receptor for MHC Class I molecules on Natural Killer cells. Bristol-Myers Squibb is working on Lirilumab, a monoclonal antibody to KIR. * LAG3: short for Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3, works to suppress an immune response by action to Tregs as well as direct effects on CD8+ T cells. Bristol-Myers Squibb is in Phase I with an anti-LAG3 monoclonal antibody called BMS-986016. * NOX2: short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH oxidase isoform 2, is an enzyme of myeloid cells that generates immunosuppressive reactive oxygen species. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NOX2 in myeloid cells improves anti-tumor functions of adjacent NK cells and T cells and also triggers autoimmunity in humans and experimental animals. NOX2 is the target of Ceplene that has gained approval for use in acute myeloid leukemia within the EU. * PD-1: short for Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) receptor, has two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This checkpoint is the target of Merck & Co.'s melanoma drug Keytruda, which gained FDA approval in September 2014. The checkpoint is also the target of EMD Serono (Merck KGaA)'s drug Bavencio, which gained FDA approval in 2017. An advantage of targeting PD-1 is that it can restore immune function in the tumor microenvironment. * TIM-3: short for T-cell Immunoglobulin domain and Mucin domain 3, expresses on activated human CD4+ T cells and regulates Th1 and Th17 cytokines. TIM-3 acts as a negative regulator of Th1/Tc1 function by triggering cell death upon interaction with its ligand, galectin-9. * VISTA: Short for V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation, VISTA is primarily expressed on hematopoietic cells so that consistent expression of VISTA on leukocytes within tumors may allow VISTA blockade to be effective across a broad range of solid tumors. * SIGLEC7 (Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin- type lectin 7, also designated as CD328) and SIGLEC9 (Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin 9, also designated as CD329) are proteins found on the surface of various immune cells, including natural killer cells and macrophages (SIGLEC7) and neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and activated T-cells (SIGLEC9). SIGLECs 7 and 9 suppress the immune function of these cells by binding to terminal sialic acid on glycans that cover the surface of cells. ==Immune checkpoint inhibitors== Drugs or drug candidates that inhibit/block the inhibitory checkpoint molecules are sometimes known as checkpoint inhibitors; this idea is often referred to as immune checkpoint blockade, or simply checkpoint blockade. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs have seen growth in pharmaceutical research in cancer by companies including Bristol- Myers Squibb, Merck, Merck KGaA, Roche and AstraZeneca. A new area of checkpoint inhibitor drugs is being pursued by Palleon Pharmaceuticals, who are working on inhibiting SIGLEC 7 and SIGLEC 9 as a new class of receptors for antibody therapeutics. == References == Category:Immune system ","title":"Immune checkpoint"},{"id":"46868849","text":"Julie Harris (1925–2013) was an American actress Julie Harris may also refer to: * Julie Harris (costume designer) (1921–2015), British costume designer * Julie Harris (cricketer) (born 1960), New Zealand cricketer * Julie M.

It tells the story of teenage sociopath John Wayne Cleaver, now seventeen years old and the member of a team of FBI agents dedicated to hunting down a network of supernatural murderers known as \\"the Withered.\\" The Devil's Only Friend is the fourth book in the John Wayne Cleaver series, preceded by I Am Not a Serial Killer (2009), Mr. Monster (2010), and I Don't Want to Kill You (2011). The majority of its reviews were positive, and it was selected as the 2015 Whitney Award winner in the speculative fiction category. Translations include Spanish and German. It the first novel in the second John Cleaver trilogy, and is followed by Over Your Dead Body (2016). == Development == Wells originally opposed continuing the series because he felt that \\"John's character arc concluded in what [he] thought was a very satisfying way.\\" Because The Devil's Only Friend is the first book in the second John Wayne Cleaver trilogy, Wells wrote the novel in a way that newcomers to the series would be able to understand it without having to read the first three books first. He wanted to \\"explore the demons more,\\" particularly their past, and to \\"take John in a new direction: not to repeat his character arc from the first series, but to build on it and show him grappling with new emotional problems.\\" In addition to John, Wells \\"particularly enjoyed\\" writing the characters of Agent Potash and Elijah Sexton, who are introduced in the novel. He has also said that his close relationship with his grandfather, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, influenced his writing in The Devil's Only Friend. == Plot summary == John and Brooke have left Clayton, the tiny North Dakota town where they grew up. Even though \\"Nobody\\", the demon who possessed Brooke, has been destroyed, the girl is still suffering from its memories. As a result, she has multiple personalities and extensive knowledge about the ancient network of demons. John and a team of FBI agents are using her recollections to hunt down this network, whom they call \\"the Withered.\\" The group consists of a police detective named Kelly, a scholar named Nathan, criminal psychologist Dr. Trujillo, sniper Diana, ex-special forces soldier Potash, and ring leader Ostler. After months of hunting in the small midwestern town of Fort Bruce, more demons begin to appear, and John fears that the Withered are starting to hunt his team in return. Their next confrontation goes awry when Kelly is killed by the target demon. John bursts in and ends its life, but loses control and stabs the body dozens of times. Their next target is Meshara, a demon in the body of a man named Elijah who consistently visits a patient with Alzheimer's. After speaking with him undercover, John hypothesizes that he isn't a killer. Next, a victim of a cannibal attack is found, and the team uses their criminal profiling skills to try to determine this new demon's weakness. It sends letters to the team, using the name \\"the Hunter.\\" New evidence from Brooke suggests that there are two factions of demons who are enemies. During a police raid, the team finds John was right about Meshara/Elijah: he has no desire to kill, and even saves the humans from the other Withered. Meanwhile, John grows frustrated with his team, and feels that he could work more effectively on his own. He begins communicating with the Hunter in secret. Their next letter from the Hunter reveals the deep, dark secrets of each member of the team. John figures out that the Hunter has faked being a cannibal to throw them off the scent of who he really is: the king demon Rack, whose defining characteristic is his lack of a mouth and heart. The team and a police security detail break into Rack's house, but it goes horribly wrong. Ostler, Diana, and all the officers are killed. John calls Nathan and tells him to protect Brooke because he thinks Dr. Trujillo is a traitor. The three find Elijah, but shortly after they do, Potash shows up and kills him. While John confronts his team member, Nathan sneaks up from behind and shoots Potash in the head. It is revealed that Nathan, the true traitor, killed Dr. Trujillo and informed Rack of their current location. Using Brooke as a distraction, John stabs Nathan and sets a trap for Rack by embalming Nathan's body with gasoline, which will poison the Withered if he absorbs Nathan's heart. When Rack shows up, he chooses Potash's heart instead and tries to recruit John to his side and become a Withered himself. John is tempted but refuses. Rack then takes Nathan's heart and dies. John and Brooke leave town, with plans to hunt down Rack's friends. == Reception == The Devil's Only Friend received mostly positive reactions, with some reviewers citing the conclusion as a weak spot. Herb Scribner for Deseret News praised the \\"imagery and ... vivid storytelling\\" present in The Devil's Only Friend, but disapproved of the amount of supporting characters and plot twists. He also called the novel's finale \\"almost a rushed afterthought.\\" However, Amanda Shrum for Brigham Young University's Children's Book and Media Review deemed the ending \\"satisfying\\" and cited John Wayne Cleaver as \\"one of the most intriguing characters in Young Adult fiction.\\" Marty Mulrooney for Alternative Magazine Online writes: \\"The only real downside of the book is that John’s reluctance to connect with the people around him can stop the reader doing so too. This makes some situations feel less impactful and also makes John seem less likable, although he remains a fascinating protagonist nonetheless.\\" Publishers Weekly applauded the \\"top-notch writing and well- structured suspense elements\\" present in the novel. Craig Clark for Booklist also praised the prose, and added: \\"John's first-person narration is at once deeply disturbing and darkly humorous.\\" A Salt Lake Magazine reviewer wrote: \\"Wells’ fast-paced writing style works well with the plot, which doesn’t lag at any point in the novel. Even with the quick pace, Wells manages to develop well-formed characters.\\" == Awards and nominations == * 2015 Whitney Award for Speculative Fiction == See also == * Dan Wells * I Am Not a Serial Killer * I Am Not a Serial Killer (film) * Mr. Monster * I Don't Want to Kill You == References  External links == * Author's website * Dan Wells papers at L.

The city was successfully defended by the Dutch garrison with the assistance of a small band of French Royalists. ==Course== It was the last of several French Republican sieges during 1792–1793. Inspired by military successes in the Austrian Netherlands, the French First Republic declared war on the Dutch Republic and England on 1 February 1793. General Charles-François Dumouriez invaded the Dutch Republic from the south-west, aiming for Breda, while Francisco de Miranda advanced along the river Meuse towards the heavily-fortified city of Maastricht. Miranda hoped to take the city in a few days with only 15,000 men and invested it from the Wyck suburb side. The Dutch garrison of 4,500 men were led by the governor of Maastricht, Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel. They were assisted by around 1200 French Royalist of the Armée des Émigrés, including 300 officers, under the command of Jean Thérèse de Beaumont d'Autichamp, a former cavalry general of the French royal army. On 6 February, De Miranda completed the circumvallation of Maastricht and Wyck. Sapping took around two weeks, after which the city was heavily bombed for ten days. More than 800 buildings were destroyed. After the Austrian victory at the nearby Battle of Aldenhoven (1793) on 1 March, the French Republican lines were themselves besieged by 50,000 Austrians and 20,000 Prussians, led by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Miranda ordered a retreat on 2 March, described by some as a \\"flight\\". On 4 September, the Prince of Coburg held a triumphal entrance in the city, followed by a Te Deum in the Church of Saint Servatius. A year and a half later, Jean-Baptiste Kléber was more successful.

Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, 575 U.S. ___ (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding a Muslim- American woman, Samantha Elauf, who was refused a job at Abercrombie & Fitch in 2008 because she wore a head scarf, which conflicted with the company's dress code. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled 8-1 in Elauf's favor on June 1, 2015. == Background == In 2008, Elauf, then 17 years old, applied for a job at an Abercrombie & Fitch store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. During her interview with the company, she was wearing a head scarf, but did not say why. The woman interviewing her, Heather Cooke, was initially impressed with Elauf, but also concerned about her head scarf. Cooke had told the manager of the store that she thought Elauf was wearing the scarf for religious reasons, but the manager responded that employees were not allowed to wear hats at work, and so declined to hire her. In 2009, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Abercrombie & Fitch on Elauf's behalf. This led to a lawsuit in a federal district court that resulted in Elauf receiving $20,000 in damages. However, this decision was later reversed by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of Abercrombie & Fitch on the basis that Elauf did not provide the company with information about her need for an accommodation. == Opinion of the Court == On June 1, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in favor of Elauf. In an opinion by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that Elauf did not have to explicitly request an accommodation to obtain protection from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious discrimination in hiring. Justice Samuel Alito wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, stating that evidence of Abercrombie's knowledge of Elauf's religious practice was sufficient grounds to rule against Abercrombie.EEOC, slip op. at 2 (Alito, S., concurring). Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in part and dissented in part. Thomas agreed with the majority's interpretation that Title VII protects against \\"intentional discrimination\\" against a particular religious group, but felt that Abercrombie did not really engage in that here because their dress code was a religion-neutral policy that affected all potential applicants.EEOC, slip op. at 5-6 (Thomas, C., dissenting).

It is named after the ensembles and the drums played by them. It is considered one of the oldest styles within the rumba complex, and its performance became rare by the 20th century. ==History== The word \\"tahona\\" initially described a type of single-headed hand drum with a body made of a wooden barrel and a goatskin head, larger than the tumbadora (conga drum). The ensembles, and ultimately the music itself, also adopted the term tahona. As a genre, tahona is considered a style of Cuban rumba, and together with yambú it is one of the oldest. However, it differs from the canonical rumba styles in the fact that it developed in the eastern part of Cuba, the Oriente Province, due to the immigration of Haitian slaves following the Haitian Revolution of the 1790s. Thus, tahona exhibits similarities to tumba francesa (another Afro-Cuban style imported by Haitians) and conga (a style of street music developed in Santiago de Cuba). Initially, tahonas were holiday dances performed by the slaves and their descendants, later turning into \\"rural congas\\" (Afro-Cuban parades) performed during carnival celebrations. The instrumentation of these parades in the 1860s revolved around two tahonas often called huecos (\\"hollow\\"), which are tuned in high and low registers, and two tamboras (a bass drum also found in tumba francesa). The different tahona drums are called repique (drumroll) and fondo (background). When the tahona ensembles participated in carnival parades they added one or two tumbadoras, hierros (iron idiophones), trumpet and saxophone. According to Harold Courlander, in Matanzas, tahonas were performed on two tumbadoras, claves and marímbula. According to Fernando Ortiz, tahona ensembles emerged as a way of making tumbas francesas \\"portable\\", since the drums in tumba francesas were to large to be carried in street parades. He described tahona ensembles as containing three tahonas (one repique and two fondos), one tambora, one tragaleguas (another drum), a hierro, and a guamo (an aerophone made of a sea snail).Ortiz (1954). p. 109. Chachás (rattles) were also added as in tumba francesa.Ortiz (1954). p. 113. An additional bass drum called bimba, which is smaller but deeper than the tambora, was also played by tahona ensembles. Tahona spread across Oriente to Alto Songo, La Maya and Ti Arriba. It was brought to Havana by a percussion ensemble of ñáñigos (Efik descendants in Abakuá societies) named \\"La Tajona\\".Ortiz (1954). p. 157. In the Havana neighborhood of Carraguao, the tahona became commonly performed on many festivities. Its popularity among bakers led many to believe that it was named after the Spanish tahona, i.e. bakery. ==Style== Like tumba francesa and rumba, tahona performances are percussion-driven and feature call and response singing between a solo singer and a chorus. Lyrics are typically about everyday life. There are different toques or types of tahona performances with distinct dances. Two toques (called pasos, steps) have survived: *Paso de camino (\\"walking step\\"), which is slow. *Paso de tahona (\\"tahona step\\"), which is faster. It is associated with three choreographies: hechacorral, bastones and cinta. The latter is also a toque found in tumba francesa. In fact, it was common for tahonas to sometimes dance el baile francés, i.e. the tumba francesa dance.Ortiz (1954). p. 113. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Laborde, Julien (2008). La Tajona.

In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were also released in 2016, but support for their online services was dropped in 2020. The game went free-to-play in September 2020. Described as \\"soccer, but with rocket-powered cars\\", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball. Rocket League is a sequel to Psyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, a 2008 video game for the PlayStation 3. Battle-Cars received mixed reviews and was not a success, but gained a loyal fan base. Psyonix continued to support themselves through contract development work for other studios while looking to develop a sequel. Psyonix began formal development of Rocket League around 2013, refining the gameplay from Battle-Cars to address criticism and fan input. Psyonix also recognized their lack of marketing from Battle-Cars and engaged in both social media and promotions to market the game, including offering the game for free for PlayStation Plus members on release. Rocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over Battle-Cars, as well as its graphics and overall presentation, although some criticism was directed towards the game's physics engine. The game earned a number of industry awards, and saw over 10 million sales and 40 million players by the beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an esport, with professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming, along with Psyonix's own Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS). == Gameplay == Gameplay in Rocket League, where players aim to hit the ball into the opposing team's goal using their rocket-powered cars Rocket League gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later on a random side of the field. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can alter their car's orientation while midair, which combined with midair boosting allows for controlled flight. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team. Matches are usually five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well as in casual and ranked playlists. The latter serves as Rocket League competitive online mode, where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons, with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank, respectively. The game includes a single-player \\"season\\" mode, with the player competing with computer- controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced \\"Custom Training\\" sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform; players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots-on-goal over and over. A few months after it was released, Psyonix released an update that added game modes known as \\"mutators\\", modifying some aspects of gameplay, such as increased or decreased gravity, ball size, ball speed and bounciness. For the 2015 holiday season, another update replaced mutator matches with an ice hockey-inspired mode (called \\"Snow Day\\"), played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck with different physics. Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended for a few weeks after the holiday season. Snow Day was permanently added to the mutator settings for private matches and exhibition games on February 10, 2016. \\"Hoops\\", a game mode based on basketball, was added on April 26, 2016. A separate \\"Rumble\\" mode, which incorporates unusual power-ups, such as the ability to freeze the ball in place or cause a single opponent to have difficulty controlling their car, was added on September 8, 2016. An update in December 2016, known as \\"Starbase ARC\\" (based on Psyonix' mobile game ARC Squadron) added support for custom arenas for Windows players supported through Steam Workshop, along with other new content. A new game mode, Dropshot, was added in a March 2017 update. It takes place in an arena without any goals and a field made of hexagonal tiles, and uses a ball that becomes increasingly electrified after successful strikes or passes. The more the ball is struck by players without touching the ground the more electrified it becomes, and the more tiles it damages once it finally does hit the ground. The goal of the mode is to damage the opponent's floor enough to break a hole into it, allowing the ball to drop through and score. Once a team scores, the floor on that side of the field resets to normal (while the floor on the scoring team's side retains any existing damage). As part of a means to monetize the game beyond downloadable content, Psyonix has tried a few different approaches. In September 2016, it introduced a loot box system known as \\"Crates\\", where players could purchase them with a random selection of in-game customization items, opened through the purchase of Keys using real-world funds. Due to increasing governmental concern over loot boxes, Psyonix replaced the Crates system with Blueprints in December 2019, which offer a known specific item with potential modifiers as potential end- of-match drops. These Blueprints can then be crafted using the game's new premium currency (Credits), or purchased with real-world funds, if the player so chooses. A new rotating Item Shop was introduced in December 2019 as well, with Featured items available on a 48-hour timer and Daily items on a 24-hour timer. The Item Shop includes all types of in-game items, such as Painted Cars, Exotic Wheels, Goal Explosions, and many more. Each item has a listed Credit value that will show the item's cost, allowing players to purchase the exact item they want, instead of relying on RNG to attain a specific item previously available through loot boxes. Separately, Psyonix added a battle pass feature to the game in September 2018, known as the \\"Rocket Pass\\". Each pass, which lasts a few months, has challenges and other opportunities through playing Rocket League that allow players to increase the tier of the Pass, from which new unique customization options tied to that pass can be unlocked. While the Rocket Pass is free to all players, a flat-cost premium option can be purchased which accelerates the level up rate and unlocks additional items at certain tier levels. The earlier mentioned \\"Snow Day\\" was brought back permanently. == Development == Psyonix had previously developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself bore out from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder, Dave Hagewood, had done for Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle-based gameplay that Epic Games had already set in place in the engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. For this, Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects, Psyonix worked to try to find a way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics-based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes, but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles, they had hit upon the right formula, which would become Battle-Cars. Further to the success was the addition of the rocket-powered cars; this originally was to be a simple speed boost, but with the physics engine, they were able to have the vehicles fly off and around the arena, furthering the possibilities for gameplay. As Psyonix finished development of Battle-Cars, the studio had tried to gain access to a publisher by selling their game as \\"soccer, but with rocket-powered cars\\", but none of the publishers seemed interested. Ultimately, they opted to self-publish the title on the PlayStation Network with almost no marketing. Though the title was downloaded more than two million times, it was not considered very successful even after the studio cut the price. The studio continued on to other projects, though kept the idea of building on Battle-Cars as an option, recognizing the game had a small but dedicated fan-base that provided them with ideas for expansion. These other projects, which including contract work for AAA titles, including Mass Effect 3 and Gears of War, helped to fund the development of Rocket League. Full development of Rocket League started around 2013 and took around two years and under $2 million to develop, though they had tested various prototypes of a Battle-Cars sequel in the years prior, including an unsuccessful attempt at pitching the game's idea to Electronic Arts in 2011. Psyonix used some of the feedback from Battle-Cars to fine-tune the gameplay in Rocket League. A key requirement for Psyonix was to increase the game's frame rate from 30 to 60 frames-per-second, a known criticism from Battle-Cars and essential for newer hardware, according to Corey Davis, the design director at Psyonix. Hagewood recognized that Battle-Cars was considered \\"too hardcore\\" with the game becoming too inaccessible to novice players against skilled ones. They eased up on some aspects to make it more approachable, such as by slowing the pace of the game and allowing players of all skill levels to reasonably compete against each other while promoting team-based gameplay. Though they tried to add elements like power-ups, they found these to be too distracting to gameplay. They also explored other changes such as making the game more gritty, akin to Monday Night Combat, developing several mini-games related to handling of the car, working on making the graphics give a sense of scale to the players to give the impression they were controlling full-sized vehicles rather than radio-controlled cars, and creating an open world structure where the player would drive between stadium and stadium to participate in matches. Instead, the team opted to strip the game to its core, focusing on more visual elements to enhance the title. From Battle-Cars, Psyonix recognized very few players actually went online, and developed Rocket League single-player season mode to encourage players to try online matches once they completed it. GDC 2016 Psyonix's team were aware of past difficulties that they had with Battle-Cars and other racing games with online play and client-side prediction, and the issues that would arise from that with Rocket League fast- paced play style. To solve this, the physics in the game are based on using the Bullet physics engine within the Unreal Engine 3's PhysX engine, which tracks the movement of all the cars and actors, allowing them to periodically re-synchronize the game state across players based on the stored physics states, which enabled players to have quick reactions from their client. At the time of Battle-Cars, Psyonix could not afford a dedicated server network and were forced to rely on individual hosts, which could lead to poor performance with slow Internet connections. With Rocket League, Psyonix was able to put a dedicated server network in place, writing their own service protocols to interface with Sony's and Valve's online services so as to enable cross-platform play, as well as improving matchmaking capabilities. Psyonix's previous experience in contract work for AAA titles had exposed them to the larger developers' approach to release and quality control, and they were able to apply those principles and aim for the same level of quality requirements in the final release of Rocket League. Psyonix had at one point considered having Rocket League as a free-to-play title with microtransactions, inspired by Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 free-to-play models. Though they had put in efforts to establish a free-to-play model, Psyonix decided instead to switch to a traditional sale method, and offer only cosmetic elements as downloadable content, assuring that no players would have any additional advantage beyond their own skill. The name Rocket League was selected in part to reduce the size of the game's title in order to appear fully in digital storefronts, and also served to be an easier to remember name as well as a more mature-sounding title than Battle-Cars, according to Hagewood; speaking on Rocket League development in March 2016, Davis opined that Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket- Powered Battle-Cars was \\"the worst game name of all time\\". ===Cross-platform play=== Rocket League has been one of the leading games in supporting cross- platform play between personal computers and consoles. Jeremy Dunham, Psyonix's vice president of publishing, sees cross-platform play helps establish a stable player base and avoid the snowball effect that can cause isolated player bases on individual platforms to wane, particularly in the transition from one console generation to the next. Though the Xbox One version lacked this feature at launch, Microsoft in March 2016 announced that Rocket League would be the first game in a new initiative they were taking to enable cross-play between Xbox One and Microsoft Windows players who have Xbox Live accounts; this cross-platform play feature was added in an update in May 2016. Microsoft has stated that they offer other networks, such as Sony's PlayStation Network, the ability to integrate with Xbox Live to allow full cross-platform compatibility for titles like Rocket League. Dunham noted that this cross-platform idea had been something they asked Microsoft about when Rocket League was set for an Xbox One release, but he stated that Microsoft did not seem to be on board with it. Only after they had neared the release date would Microsoft take the initiative to offer the title as one for their new cross-play efforts and started working towards this possibility in the game. Psyonix determined the required technical steps needed to enable cross- platform play and have tested it in closed environments, and were only waiting for the legalities of cross-connecting players between different networks before proceeding. this work also includes how they would be able to distribute updated content patches in a unified and more frequent manner to enable them to continue to expand the game for at least another 9 months. In a July 2016 interview with IGN, Dunham stated they had done all the technical work and could enable cross-platform play between the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions \\"within a few hours\\" of Sony's approval. As of March 2017, the company is ready to enable this feature, but was still waiting for the console manufacturers to come to the required agreements to allow it. With the announcement of the Switch version, Psyonix affirmed that it would support cross-platform play with PC and Xbox users. Sony still opted not to participate in this; PlayStation global marketing head Jim Ryan said that while they are \\"open to conversations with any developer or publisher who wants to talk about it\\", their decision was \\"a commercial discussion between ourselves and other stakeholders\\". Dunham says that in contrast to Microsoft or Nintendo, who agreed to allow cross-platform play within a month and with the day of Psyonix' request, respectively, Sony has been asked on a nearly daily basis about this support and have yet to receive any definitive answer. The cross-platform party feature is planned for an update in early 2019. This will allow players to create in-game friend lists across platforms and play in matches with them. This is limited by the current cross-platform limitations: while Windows players can add friends from other Windows users and Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch users, PlayStation 4 users are limited to Windows and PlayStation 4 users. In September 2018, Sony had altered its position on cross-platform play following the release of Fortnite Battle Royale for the Nintendo Switch, where the lack of cross-platform play had been a point of significant criticism. Sony allowed Fortnite to be cross-platform play compatible with all platforms and stated they would review other games on a case-by-case basis. By January 2019, Psyonix announced that Sony had granted the same for Rocket League, allowing cross-platform play between the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch and PC versions in February 2019. ===Free-to- play transition=== Psyonix transitioned Rocket League to a free-to-play model on all platforms on September 23, 2020. Associated with the transition, the game added cross-platform progression that covers the cosmetic items players have earned, a battle pass system for cosmetic rewards for completing certain challenges, and other features. The free-to-play version eliminated the need for players to have console subscription services like PlayStation Plus or Nintendo Switch Online to be able to play. Some changes were also made to the game's tournaments and challenge systems to help with monetization. Players that had purchased the game prior to the transition were given \\"Legacy\\" status and some related cosmetic items. As part of this transition, the Windows version of the game was moved off Steam onto the Epic Games Store. Players that had already owned the Steam version prior to the change were still able to download, update the game and play it with cross-play with other platforms, and would continue to receive updates. === Downloadable content === basket instead of a goal Psyonix planned to continue to support Rocket League with downloadable content (DLC), intending to keep all gameplay updates free and only charging for cosmetic items. In November 2015, a free update added the ability to \\"Mutate\\" a match, allowing for a number of different custom presets and match settings, including a low gravity mode and a cubed ball, among other improvements and additions. Through this, Psyonix is able to offer custom game playlists to test out new modes or for holiday-themed events. For example, during the latter part of December 2015, Psyonix introduced an ice hockey- based mutation alongside a special event featuring holiday-themed decorative items, replacing the normal ball with a hockey puck, and changing the floor to ice. This mode proved very popular and was permanently added to the standard playlists on February 24, 2016. In February 2016, a new game playlist called \\"Rocket Labs\\" was added to offer new experimental maps to players as a means to gauge feedback and interest in a map before adding it to the game's standard map playlist. In April 2016, the developers added the basketball- based playlist to the standard playlists. A new \\"Rumble\\" mode, which adds unique power-ups on various maps, was released in September 2016. The game's first DLC pack, titled Supersonic Fury, was released in August 2015, along with new arena Utopia Coliseum. It contains exclusive cosmetics, including two new cars, rocket boosts, wheels, five paint finishes, and twelve decals for both new cars. The same month, it was announced that Rocket League would be ported to macOS and Linux later that year, in order to run natively with SteamOS hardware; Rocket League and Portal 2 were part of incentives for those that pre-ordered a Steam Link, a Steam Controller, or a Steam Machine. The game's second DLC pack, titled Revenge of the Battle-Cars, was released in October 2015. The DLC adds two more cars from Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket- Powered Battle-Cars, along with exclusive cosmetics for both. In another event, players had a chance to collect six Halloween-themed items from October 18 to November 2. The game's third DLC pack, titled Chaos Run, was released in December 2015. The DLC added two more cars, along with more cosmetics. A new arena, called \\"Wasteland\\", was released for free alongside the DLC. The map is notable for being the first non-standard arena to be released, having a different size and shape than the others and inspired by the Mad Max films, the first of which Psyonix plans to release over time. In June 2016, a new arena, Neo Tokyo, based on the Rocket Labs layout Underpass, was added to the game via an update. The update also introduced cosmetic items awarded at the end of matches with various rarity grades, and gave players the ability to trade multiple items of the same type and rarity grade to obtain an item of a better rarity grade. Also included in the patch are a number of painted and certified items, the latter of which are cosmetic items with statistics- recording tags, and eight new achievements. Psyonix added the ability for players to trade items with other players within the \\"Rumble\\" update, including item and crate drop systems comparable to Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, in which players have the chance to gain locked crates from playing in competitive matches. Players are able to purchase keys to open these crates through microtransactions, revealing special decorative items for their cars. Players can opt-out of this feature to disable crate drops. Though items received in crates are tradable within the game, these items cannot be sold on the platform's respective marketplaces so as to prevent issues in the same vein as the Counter-Strike skin gambling controversy. The funds from microtransactions would be used to support the esports tournaments organized by Psyonix. In October 2016, a major update titled \\"Aquadome\\" launched, featuring a new arena placed under the sea, along with two new premium water-themed cars, and a new crate containing new items and seven new achievements. Psyonix was able to make licensing agreements to include vehicles and decorative items from other franchises within the game. On launch, the PlayStation 4 version included Sweet Tooth's car from the Twisted Metal series. As a separate DLC, the DeLorean time machine from the Back to the Future film franchise, was released on October 21, 2015, corresponding with Back to the Future Day. The Xbox One release includes platform-exclusive Gears of War and Halo-themed vehicles. The Batmobile, as seen in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, was offered as a playable vehicle in March 2016, while Dominic Toretto's Dodge Charger from the film The Fate of the Furious was added to tie in with the film's release in April 2017. An update released in July 2017 introduced a new arena celebrating the one-year anniversary of the game, along with cosmetic items based on the American animated show Rick & Morty. Alongside the theatrical release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Psyonix released Jurassic Park and Jurassic World-themed content, including a Jurassic Park-themed Jeep Wrangler car model. In September 2015, Psyonix held a cross-promotion with Torn Banner Studios, adding two free new flags themed after Torn Banner's Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. At the same time the \\"Chaos Run\\" DLC was released, Psyonix added free cosmetics and accessories from the Portal series by Valve. Themed content based on Goat Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator were added to the game in April 2016 as part of cross-promotional deals with those games. Other themed promotional content includes decorative items based on The Witcher and Worms W.M.D. With the release of the basketball game mode in 2016, Psyonix partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA), offering flags with all 30 NBA team logos as car customization items. In February 2017, two iconic Hot Wheels cars were added to the game, along with other cosmetic items based on the brand. For the 2019 Radical Summer event, Psyonix released two new car packs; the Ecto-1 from the Ghostbusters film franchise in June, and the KITT from the 1980s television series Knight Rider in July. Psyonix had hoped to include KITT as early as 2016. For the 2019 Halloween event, cars and other cosmetics based on the television series Stranger Things were added. In May 2020, Psyonix introduced the Modes of May event, which included a number of limited-time game modes for every weekend of the month. The modes include Dropshot Rumble, Beach Ball, Boomer Ball, and Heatseeker, which features a curving ball that magnetizes toward both ends of the field, drawing comparisons to the 1972 table tennis sports game Pong. === Music === The original soundtrack for Rocket League was released both physically and digitally on July 1, 2015. It contains original compositions by Psyonix sound designer Mike Ault, as well as contributions by Ault's electronic music group, Hollywood Principle. New songs were added to the game with post-release updates, including \\"Chaos Run Theme\\" by Kevin Riepl, \\"Escape from LA (Instrumental)\\" by Abandoned Carnival and Ault, and a remix of Hollywood Principle's \\"Breathing Underwater\\" by Ether. These songs were later compiled in the second volume of the soundtrack, which was released on July 7, 2016. iam8bit published a three-disc vinyl version of the soundtrack, consisting of the above two volumes, in late 2016. The game's 2nd anniversary update included a musical content pack featuring releases from the EDM label Monstercat. The label have also released a series of standalone albums featuring the music, titled Rocket League x Monstercat. == Release == Rocket League was officially announced as the sequel to Battle-Cars in February 2014. Building on the effects from the lack of marketing with Battle-Cars, Psyonix developed a different marketing approach to Rocket League. This included engaging with YouTube and Twitch video game streamers with early release copies to help spread the word, recognizing that clips from the game would be readily shared through social media. They also opened the game to early alpha and beta testing for several months following the game's announcement. Davis noted that they otherwise did not spend any money on traditional marketing approaches. They had originally planned to release the game around November 2014, but had missed this deadline to implement better matchmaking and servers, high frame rates, and removing the free-to-play elements. The game was released publicly on July 7, 2015 for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. Davis considered this serendipitous, as this moved the game out from a busy period of many major releases during the holiday season to the relatively quiet mid-year period, reducing the amount of competition from other titles. Further, the game on release was made part of Instant Game Collection on the PlayStation 4 and free to PlayStation Plus subscribers; within the week, Psyonix had seen more than 183,000 unique players, exceeding their server capacity and requiring them to improve on their network code to handle the influx of players. Davis estimated there were six million downloads of the game from this promotion, and considered this the \\"best decision\\" they had ever made. At The Game Awards 2015, it was announced that the game would be ported to Xbox One, where it was released on February 17, including most of the previous DLC packs for free. Ports for macOS and Linux were released on September 8, 2016. A retail version of Rocket League, in form of the game's Collector's Edition, was announced in February 2016, and was released in Europe on June 24, 2016 and in North America on July 5, 2016. The Collector's Edition is published and distributed by 505 Games, and includes the first three downloadable content packs for free, as well as four additional cars to be available as digital download on July 18: Aftershock and Marauder (both from Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars), as well as Esper and Masamune. In October 2017, Psyonix announced that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment would begin to publish an updated version of the game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles by the end of that year, which includes additional content for both versions. The PlayStation 4 version was patched in February 2017 to offer PlayStation 4 Pro support, allowing for 4K resolution and constant 60 frames-per-second rendering at 1080p for one and two-player split-screen players; three and four-player split screen will render up to 60 frames-per-second when possible. Similar rendering improvements were also made to the standard PlayStation 4 to approach constant 60 frames-per-second for most arenas and modes. After reviewing the feasibility of doing so, Psyonix announced that Rocket League would also be released for the Nintendo Switch, as revealed during Nintendo's press conference during E3 2017. It was released later that year on November 14, and includes Nintendo property customization options, including Mario, Luigi, and Metroid-inspired car designs, and supports cross-platform play with the PC and Xbox One versions. Due to the Switch's lack of natural support for Unreal Engine 3, some compromises had to be made in the porting process, such as by reducing the graphical quality to 720p. Despite having to do custom work to make the game run smoothly on the Switch, Dunham was impressed with the work that had been done before release. Austin, Texas-based studio Panic Button assisted Psyonix with the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch ports, and graphical updates to support the PlayStation 4 Pro. In April 2017, Psyonix announced that they had partnered with Tencent to bring a free-to-play version of Rocket League to the Chinese gaming market, with users able to purchase cosmetic items through microtransactions. It was successfully licensed through China's approval process in July 2019. Because of the continued growth of the game's player base, Psyonix's Dunham said they do not anticipate creating any sequel to the game, and instead are expecting to continue to add new features to the game over several years' time, calling this an \\"infinite support window\\". A small team within Psyonix was set up to explore new features and gameplay ideas to continue to expand Rocket League. In May 2019, Epic Games announced that it had acquired Psyonix for an undisclosed amount. Psyonix has had a long-standing relationship with the studio (its original North Carolina headquarters were only 12 miles (19 km) away from those of Epic), having worked with it on development tools for the Unreal Engine. As a result of the purchase, the game was planned to be added to the Epic Games Store by late-2019, but Psyonix was unclear over whether the game would become exclusive to the store. The game became subject to review bombing on Steam due to this sale, triggering Steam's \\"off-topic review activity\\" system, which hides reviews that do not correlate with the game itself. Psyonix announced in January 2020 that as part of a major upgrade to the base game systems, they would be dropping support for macOS and Linux from the game by March 2020. After March 2020, these versions will no longer be able to connect and use the online parts of the game, but can still be played in single player or local multiplayer. Psyonix said in a followup message that macOS and Linux players represented less than 0.3% of the total player base and could not justify keeping these as supported platforms as they advanced the other platforms to newer technology, such as moving the Windows version from DirectX 9 to 11. The developer offered full refunds to the game for macOS and Linux owners regardless of how long they had the game. ===Cross- promotions=== Psyonix teamed with Internal Drive to provide Rocket League as part of the latter's iD Tech summer educational camps for children, using the game for both recreation and for teaching elements of game design. In 2017, the game served as a sponsor of WWE pay-per-view events Backlash, Great Balls of Fire, and SummerSlam. The following year, the companies announced a further partnership, with WWE cosmetic items introduced to the game in April. Psyonix partnered with Zag Toys to produce a series of pullback toy cars based on the Rocket League vehicles, which released in June 2017. Some of these included a redeemable code that can be used within the game for unique customization items. The developers also filmed television advertisements for Rocket League that started airing the same month. Alongside these ads, Psyonix offered free copies of Rocket League alongside purchase of selected Nvidia graphics cards. In December 2018, toy car brand Hot Wheels released a radio-controlled car (RC car) game set based on the game that features two RC cars that are controlled through Bluetooth devices, a play field, a ball containing infrared sensors for scoring purposes, and charging devices. == Esports == Psyonix had observed the popularity of Rocket League matches on Twitch and other live streaming platforms, and in February 2016, were looking to use the game more in esports. In March 2016, Psyonix announced the first Rocket League Championship Series; the finals took place in August 2016 with a $55,000 prize pool. More than $1 million in revenues from the sale of in-game crates and cosmetic items were used to fund additional competitive events throughout the year, including smaller competitions at major gaming conventions and support for community-run competitive events. Soon after release, Rocket League became an officially sponsored esport, joining ESL. In September 2015, Major League Gaming (MLG) announced the first season of the Pro Rocket League, which was held in September through early October. A $75,000 Rocket League tournament was held outside U.S. Bank Stadium at the Summer X Games in July 2017, with the finals streamed live on ESPN3. NRG Esports claimed their first live Rocket League championship by winning the tournament, defeating Gale Force eSports in the final. As NBC's first foray into esports, NBC Sports Group, in conjunction with Faceit, ran its own $100,000-prize pool tournament which was broadcast across its eight worldwide regions in July–August 2017. Starting in September 2017, Psyonix and Tespa, a collegiate esports organizer, held the first collegiate tournament for teams to win a share of $50,000 in scholarships. In December 2017, Turner Sports organized a ELEAGUE Cup event for eight teams was broadcast live on streaming media, with a three-part series of shows detailing some of the teams' path to the Cup and some of the match results, which aired on TBS later in the month. 2020 has brought a large change to Rocket League Esports, the addition of a new competitive format that has 3 splits that include 3 regional events each with one major LAN at the end of the 3 splits. Each team gets points awarded based on how they place in these regional events with the top teams making the world LAN, with the grand prize of $1,000,000. == Reception == Rocket League, upon release and throughout its lifetime, has been given positive reviews by video game critics. Similar scores were attained by the game's later ports. Positive feedback was aimed towards the game's multiplayer gameplay, and its graphics and visuals, especially in comparison to Battle-Cars; later reviews praised the player experience in the game. Criticism was mostly aimed at the game's physics engine, though a consensus on the topic has been mostly unclear, with some defending the engine. In a review of Rocket League beta preview, Ozzie Mejia of Shacknews praised Psyonix's approach to updating Battle-Cars using the PlayStation 4's hardware, describing the graphics as \\"brilliantly detailed\\" and \\"crisp\\" and noting its consistent frame rates throughout. Robert Summa of Destructoid shared Mejia's view that the game was \\"fun option for anyone looking to mix their racing and sports games together\\", himself describing that the game was \\"addictive and fun as hell.\\" Reviewers from Polygon, PlayStation Universe, and Videogamer.com shared positive views towards multiplayer gameplay in Rocket League. Ben Kuchera of Polygon wrote that the game \\"introduces a well-known concept and then adds a complication.\\" Kuchera disagreed with Pinkerton and asserted that the game's physics were \\"internally consistent\\", and summarized his experience with the game as \\"joyful\\" and rewarding in its progression. The game's physics engine continued to be a point of contention in later reviews, including Steven Burns' review for Videogamer.com, in which he shared his opinion that the speed of the ball should have been increased in certain modes to compensate for the \\"floaty\\" physics. Neil Bolt of PlayStation Universe shared a similar view, writing that the physics \\"causes frustration in 4v4 bouts where everyone ends up huddling under the slow-descending ball for long periods.\\" In a review for PC Gamer, Matt Elliott defended the physics engine by pointing out the \\"[nice] contrast\\" between the fast player-controlled cars and the slower-moving ball, colorfully describing that the ball \\"gormlessly invites impact like a punchable cousin.\\" Elliott also wrote positively of the multiplayer gameplay, comparing the \\"destruction\\" mechanic to the Burnout series, and praising the overall player experience. In complimenting the game's points system, Elliott recounted, \\"the most valuable players I encountered were workmanlike wingers who selflessly chugged along the flanks, crossing the ball for greedy goalhunters like me. It stops players from clustering in the same spots and reinforces the concept that Rocket League is a team game.\\" Alec Meer of Rock Paper Shotgun, in a restrospective review written two years after its release, shared similar feelings about the player experience in Rocket League. Meer claimed that the game remained \\"very open, friendly, and accessible to new players across all ages, in contrast to other games with online longevity that tend to be dominated by expert players and difficult to breach by new ones.\\" Following the Blueprint update in December 2019, players expressed concern that the costs of completing blueprints was more expensive than the cost to open loot boxes, that players got more items for opening a loot box, and that in general, the loot box system felt more rewarding. Within a week of the update, Psyonix reduced the prices of blueprint by half and refunding credits for those that had spent them already. === Sales === On July 11, 2015, Psyonix announced that there were around 120,000 concurrent players across both Windows and PlayStation 4.

During both World Wars he resigned from active ministry within the Methodist Church of Australasia because of his opposition to his nation's military engagement. It was said of him on his death, that \\"he sought and found an expression for religious faith that satisfied both the demands of the spirit and the temper of the age ... for all his gentle modesty he was inflexibly firm and courageous in maintaining his convictions. He believed that war is utterly wrong.\\"Rev. B. Linden Webb and the Hay Methodist Congregation Retrieved 1 June 2015 The peace activism of the 1960s within the Methodist Church grew from Webb's pioneering pacifist theology of earlier years. ==Birth and education== Webb was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, the fifth of seven children of Edmund Tom Webb and Fanny Edgeworth Webb (née Byrnes).Edmund Tom Webb Retrieved 1 June 2015 He was a grandson of Edmund Webb and William Tom. His family were prosperous and well- connected in business and political circles. Webb attended Newington College, as had his father, and commenced in 1899.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863–1998 (Syd, 1999) pp210 In 1902, his final year at Newington, he was appointed as the Senior Prefect. The following year Webb went up to the University of Sydney and read in the faculty of arts. He had planned to become a lawyer, but during his second year of university \\"he felt the call to preach\\". He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1906. Webb chose service to the church over a career as a lawyer and became a graduate student at the Wesleyan Theological Institution which was then still based in the grounds of his Alma Mater, Newington College. ==Early ministry== After ordination, Webb served as a probationer in the North Sydney circuit. He than moved to Moss Vale and served in that circuit from early 1909 to early 1911. Later in 1911 Webb took a leave of absence and traveled to England with his new wife. On his return to Australia in 1912 he served at Tighes Hill in the Hamilton and Wickham circuit of Newcastle. In 1913 Webb was unwell and spent time within the Central Methodist Mission on sick leave and light duties. ==Hay Circuit== In March 1914 the New South Wales Methodist Conference appointed Webb to Hay, New South Wales. World War I had just started as he arrived to take up his new appointment and he soon gave a series of sermons critical of war. These were later published. The recruiting sergeant in Hay asked Webb to encourage young men in his congregation to support the war effort. All other ministers in Hay agreed to such requests but Webb refused to assist. For two and a half years the young minister found himself at odds with his congregation and broader community. Webb eventually found \\"the moral implications of Christian doctrine\\" inconsistent with those of the Methodist Church and he resigned from the ministry. He returned to the Central Methodist Mission in Sydney without pastoral charge before moving to Moss Vale in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. During this period Webb did not work as a minister but tried to support his family by teaching elocution, farming and selling fruit and clothing door-to-door. ==Later ministry== He returned to full-time Methodist ministry in 1920 and served in the Muswellbrook circuit for twelve months. The next three years were spent in Toronto, New South Wales, before moving to Sydney and serving in Gordon. In 1927 Webb left the mainland to serve on Norfolk Island. As pacifist principles flourished in the Methodist church of the 1930s Webb became physically frail and suffered from poor health. He returned to service in Sydney in 1936 when he was appointed to the Summer Hill church. For the remaining years of the decade Webb was in Campbelltown, New South Wales, and Kensington. As Australia was again at war Webb considered \\"that his pacifist principles were not consistent with his work in the church\\" and he again resigned from ministry. He aligned himself with Methodist ministers such as Alan Walker during World War II. In these years he supported his family by selling fruit and vegetables. After the war he re-entered the ministry but his health was bad and he became a supernumerary in Helensburgh, New South Wales. ==Marriage, family and death== In 1911 Webb married Eleanor Dunbar in Sydney. The union produced three daughters and a son.Bernard Linden Webb Retrieved 1 June 2015 Eleanor Webb died in 1966.

She was born María del Carmen Sánchez Castañeda in Irapuato, Guanajuato in 1936, but when she was six months old, her family moved to Mexico City where she grew up. As a child, she won a drawing contest with the Excélsior newspaper, and received a camera as a prize. This was the beginning of her work as a photographer, documenting aspects of her life. Her parents separated when she was still young, and she had to work as well as study to help her family's finances. Her aunt owned a photography business, where one day she met photographer Héctor García Cobo. She married him not long after, when she was only eighteen years old. After five years of marriage, she began working with her husband as a darkroom assistant, developing rolls that Héctor had shot. This prompted María to take her photography more seriously, balancing the raising of her children, the work with her husband and her own photography projects, starting in 1965. María began working freelance with a number of newspapers and magazines in Mexico and also became known for her photographic portraits of women such as Mother Theresa, Valentina Tereshkova and Nancy Cárdenas. In 1968, she collaborated with writer Elena Poniatowska, taking photos of the Olympics and students protests of that year. María's first exhibition of her work was at the Casa del Lago (UNAM), and has since been featured in numerous individual and collective exhibitions in venues such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana. Her most noted artistic photos combine photography with graphic design, using light and the positioning of objects over others. Along with her husband, María founded the María y Héctor García Foundation, located in Mexico City. The location conserved a collection of over 1.5 million images taken by the two. ==References== Category:Mexican photographers Category:Mexican women photographers Category:Mexican photojournalists Category:People from Irapuato Category:Artists from Guanajuato Category:1936 births Category:Living people ","title":"María García (photographer)"},{"id":"46869624","text":"'The Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society of the Republic of China (or simply Phi Tau Phi or '; ) was founded by American professor Joseph H.

Coffee production in Jamaica began after 1728, when governor Sir Nicholas Lawes introduced the crop near Castleton, north of Kingston. Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is the special variety of coffee that is grown in the Blue Mountains region, which has the most conducive climate and topographical features; this variety is known for its scent and sweet taste. Most of Jamaica's coffee production is grown for export. ==Plantation== Most of the coffee grown on the island is a derivative of the Brazilian variety known as Coffea arabica Typica, constituting 70% of the yield, while other varieties grown are hybrid varieties of caturra, geisha, etc. The coffee that is grown in the Blue Mountains region, known as the Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, is said to be of very high quality and is mostly exported. Coffee is grown at an elevation of , with a rainfall incidence varying from to more than . Farming methods are specifically oriented towards a high rate of production with optimum acidity. ==Regulation== The Ministry of Agriculture and its subordinate office, the Jamaica Agricultural Commodities Authority (previously the Coffee Industry Board), are responsible for all activities of the coffee sector. The Coffee Industry Development Company (CIDCO) (was set up by what was then the Coffee Industry Board) assumes direct responsibility for coffee production and also to render assistance to farmers owning or more of land dedicated to this crop. The Coffee Industry Regulation Act specifies what coffee may use the Blue Mountain label, and also restricts the use of the Blue Mountain trademark to production authorised by the Jamaica Agricultural Commodities Authority broadly speaking, coffee harvested from the parishes of Saint Andrew, Saint Thomas, Portland, and Saint Mary may be considered Blue Mountain coffee. ==Production== Barrels of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee beans According to FAO statistics for 2013, Jamaican coffee production was 6,984 tons, representing about 0.1% of world production. The coffee was grown in an area of with a yield rate of 8,730 hectogram per ha. For the period from 1981 to 2013, the lowest production was 958 tons in 1979 and the highest was 15,117 tons in 2007. Coffee is an export commodity. As it is labour-intensive, it provides employment to a large extent to the rural and urban people of the country right through the stages of production, processing, and sale. Requirement for export has exceeded production. More than 80 per cent of the production of Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In 2005, there was a shortfall in this export on account of destruction to the crop resulting from the Hurricane Ivan in the later part of 2004. ==See also== *Tia Maria *Economy of Jamaica ==ReferencesBibliography== * Jamaica Category:Agriculture in Jamaica Category:Jamaica–Japan relations ","title":"Coffee production in Jamaica"},{"id":"46869817","text":"The 1972 All-Pacific-8 Conference football team consists of American football players chosen for All-Pacific-8 Conference teams for the 1972 college football season.

He also studied classical composition and conducting, alongside playing his own contemporary music. He subsequently attained a master's degree in jazz from Lone Mountain College (since acquired by University of San Francisco) in San Francisco. ==Career== Power stayed in California between 1975 and 1982, scoring music for the PBS Emmy Award–winning television series Over Easy and writing music for broadcast advertising. Power contributed music for advertising campaigns for companies, including The American Cancer Society (Emmy Award winner), AT&T;, Casio, Coca-Cola, Elizabeth Arden, Hardee's, Hertz, Intel, Mercedes-Benz, Purina, and The United States Postal Service. He then moved to New York City in 1982 to further his music career by playing gigs in a variety of venues, including one performance at a wedding of a member of the Bensonhurst Mafia. Power was asked by the owner of Calliope Studios to sit in as engineer of a music recording session by the group Stetsasonic. Stetsasonic thought so highly of Power's work that he continued to work with them, overseeing the breakthrough sessions for their album On Fire. He continued his liaison with rap groups thereafter, linking up with the New York City rap collective the Native Tongues. The Native Tongues was a group of hip-hop groups, including A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, De La Soul, and Jungle Brothers. All of the musical groups within the collective based their music around intricately designed and complex arrangements of sampling. Power's ability to produce music that mimicked the clarity of the sampled recordings was highly valued by producers within the Native Tongues. His most noteworthy project as an engineer is his work on A Tribe Called Quest's sophomore album The Low End Theory, which was recorded between 1990 and 1991 and released in September 1991. Power describes his work on The Low End Theory in the following quote: > The Low End Theory was an interesting record; in a way, it was \\"The Sgt. > Pepper's\\" of hip-hop. It's a record that changed the way that people thought > about putting music together. I'm not a big hip-hop historian; I just know > the stuff that I worked on. Until that point, when people used samples on > records, it was pretty much one loop that played throughout. With The Low > End Theory, and People's Instinctive Travels to a lesser extent, Q-Tip and > Ali Shaheed were at the leading edge of a new wave where people started > making elaborate musical constructions out of samples from different places > that would not, and in many ways could not, have been played by regular > players.> By the mid-1990s, Power was given charge of a production suite at Sony Music Studios in New York. His profile as a producer continued to grow through his work with Me'Shell N'degéocello, D'Angelo, and Erykah Badu. The latter gave Power his first number 1 R&B; single, ″On & On,″ while N’degéocello’s Peace Beyond Passion received a Grammy nomination for best engineered album. ==Recent career== Bob Power is currently an Arts Professor in the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts located in New York City, NY. ==ReferencesAn interview with Bob Power Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Chicago Category:Webster University alumni Category:American audio engineers Category:Record producers from Illinois Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:New York University faculty Category:Engineers from Illinois ","title":"Bob Power"},{"id":"46869968","text":"Eupterote nobilis is a moth in the family Eupterotidae.

It is one of the properties that arose during the nineteenth century henequen boom. There are numerous other properties of this name in the Yucatán including Hacienda Kancabchén in Baca, Hacienda Kancabchén (Homún), Hacienda Kancabchén (Motul), Hacienda Kankabchén (Seyé), Hacienda Kankabchén (Tixkokob), Hacienda Kancabchén (Tunkás), Hacienda Kancabchén Ucí and Hacienda Kancabchén de Valencia. ==Toponymy== The name (Kancabchén) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground. ==How to get there== Go 67.5 km southwest from the southern Periférico of Mérida on highway 180 to the town of Halachó. Enter the town on Calle 20 and at the intersection of Calle 20 and Calle 19 and turn right, heading west to Calle 26. Take Calle 26 northwest for approximately 8 km to Hacienda Kancabchén. ==History== In 1970 the name changed from Kancabchén to Kankabchén. In 1990, it changed back to the prior spelling. ==Demographics== All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kancabchén houses only the owner's immediate family.

The strike was ineffective at closing down the Port of Portland due to strikebreakers, and on June 22 the strike ended with the employers dictating terms. == Background  The Wobblies === The Industrial Workers of the World union, also known as the IWW or the Wobblies, was founded in 1905. They were one of the most active unions in America, and they strongly opposed World War I. The Wobblies showed up in Oregon around the 1907 in logging and millworkers, and they found their center in Portland. The Wobblies were the scandalous group in Portland at the time, because their leader was accused of murder making other unions distance themselves from them.Adam Hodges, \\"Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)\\" http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/industrial_workers_of_the_world_iww_/#.VWVYUs9Viko. Their reputation did not get better over time, but actually got worse. The members of the IWW were involved in crime and seedy brothels scenes, which did not help them improve their name. In 1913 Political power took over to rid the brothels, and in 1916 the saloons as well. During 1917 the government became suspicious of all the conflict of the lumber camps and sawmill, and decided to turn over the logging industry to the control of U.S. Army. Then the Wobblies lost their meeting hall when Oregon passed \\"criminal syndicalism\\" law in 1919 that made it so they could no longer organize.Adam Hodges, \\"Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)\\"http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/industrial_workers_of_the_world_iww_/#.VWVYUs9Viko. In 1920 many of the Wobblies who weren't killed or jailed changed trades from the lumber industry to maritime work. These men started working as sailors or longshoremen, and joined unions like the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the Sailors' Union of the Pacific (SUP). The Wobblies brought their industrial unionism with them by song and file membership, but the leaders of the maritime unions kept their tradition of craft unionism.JD Chandler and JB Fisher, Portland on the Take (South Carolina: The History Press, 2014), 17. === The ILA === The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) was established in Portland Oregon around 1909, and it was not a strong union yet. The whole reason why this union was established was to fight the seamen who had begun to do longshoremen's work. The seamen had a contract with ship owners that stated that they could work a ship even if the longshoremen were part of a union. This is how the ILA got their foot in the door in Portland, Oregon.\\"The ILWU Story,\\" International Longshore and Warehouse, 2015, https://www.ilwu.org/history/the-ilwu-story/. The ILA was the original union in Portland, and they were a craft union. The only way for people to be able to be in this union was either to be related to one of the longshoremen or to be friendly with longshoremen. The men who were nonunion members got the toughest jobs, while the union members got it easy. There was only around 250 unionized longshoremen, and there was 800 affiliated nonunion member. These standards to obtain membership into their union would make it difficult for former Wobblies to get in.William W. Pilcher, The Portland Longshoremen: A dispersed Urban Community (Stanford University, 1972), 32. == The strike == In 1922 the strike began when the ILA's contract with the employers of the longshoremen ended, and the employers told their employees that they would be taking charge of who they were going to be hiring. This meant that the employer could hire nonunion workers before union members, and would make it difficult for the 250 union members to get employment from their former bosses. The ILA members walked out on strike, closing the Port of Portland for a week, but the employers brought in strike breakers, who slept on a ship in order to avoid crossing the picket line.Finn J D. John, \\"Union squabbles were part of life on Portland waterfront,\\" http://offbeatoregon.com/1303e-union- squabbles-on-portland-waterfront.html. Many of the strike breakers were the Wobblies who were unable to join the ILA union, because they were not friends or related to the longshoremen in that union. They used breaking the strike to get back at the ILA union members, and violence soon broke out between strikers and strike breakers. The violence led to the employers to getting a court order that stopped any gatherings of union members in certain places.Finn J D. John, \\"Union squabbles were part of life on Portland waterfront,\\" http://offbeatoregon.com/1303e-union-squabbles-on-portland- waterfront.html. The strike of 1922 on the Portland, OR waterfront started at the end of April until the end of June. The longshoremen of ILA accused the employers of trying to take control of the loading and unloading the cargo by forcing their own employment system to do all the hiring. The longshoremen nicked named the new system Fink Hall, and they thought this would destroy their union. This new hiring system was the last straw for the longshoremen of ILA, and it was why they went on strike.\\"Union Officials Testify,\\" Seattle Daily Times (Seattle, Washington), May 12, 1922. The strike ended on the 22nd of June with the employers laying down the terms of the strike ending. They made it to where there was one hall that did joint hiring of both non-union and union hiring, and it was supposed to be a fair way of hiring without having two separate hiring halls to hire workers. The hall had union and non- union representatives in it to keep the hiring as fair as possible.Finn J D. John, \\"Union squabbles were part of life on Portland waterfront,\\" http://offbeatoregon.com/1303e-union-squabbles-on-portland-waterfront.html. == Aftermath == The ILA union gained nothing from this strike, and they were only able to put the waterfront out of commission for a week. In this strike the employer was the real champion, because they were able to put a stop to the ILA union itself. After 1922 ILA was not longer operational in Portland, and all that remained of the union was the name International Longshoremen Association. The employers had killed the unions on the Portland waterfront, and for now had nothing to worry about when it came to hiring their dock workers. This new system of hiring would create new conflict that would rise again in another 11 years, and would be a reference for the Portland water strike of 1933.William W. Pilcher, The Portland Longshoremen: A dispersed Urban Community (Stanford University, 1972), 32. The Wobblies were also winners of this strike, because they had been a part of the strike breakers. When they went to the hiring hall they were chosen over the ILA workers, and this would also help the conflict grow over the years into 1933. Two conflicting unions that were now un- operational, because of employers wanting to take control over the hiring system. They were forced to compete for work now in the maritime trade, and the conflict would grow between the workers.William W. Pilcher, The Portland Longshoremen: A dispersed Urban Community (Stanford University, 1972), 32. == Historical significance == The Portland Waterfront strike of 1922 showed that employers could overpower the union, and that they did not have to give in to the demands of the strikers. This strike also showed that it was easy for the employers to take a union, and crush it just by using their own hiring hall. This strike really lays the ground for the bigger Portland water strike that takes place in 1934, because a lot of these issues were never resolved during 1922. Allowing the tension between union and non-union workers build and build until they finally have a breaking point in 1934. ==Further reading == Chandler, JD and JB Fisher.Portland on The Take.

On the night of 1 June 2015, the ship was traveling on the Yangtze River when it capsized during a thunderstorm in Jianli, Hubei Province with 454 people on board. On 13 June, 442 deaths were confirmed, with 12 survivors (including 2 rescued by officials). The passengers were mostly in their 60s and 70s, and mostly from Nanjing, where the ship started its cruise. The final investigation concluded the ship navigated into a squall line (the biggest scale of thunderstorm) from 21:19 onwards, blasted by a downburst (a form of windshear) from 21:26 to 21:32, capsized at 21:31, and sank at 21:32. The ship met gusts of 32–38 m/s (72-85 mph, equivalent to wind force scale of 12-13). The hourly rain was observed at 94.4mm. It is the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in China's history, and the worst maritime disaster (including wartime disasters) since the steamer sank in January 1949, killing more than 1,500. ==Sinking== Around 9:28 pm on 1 June 2015, Dongfang zhi Xing was making a trip from Nanjing to Chongqing via the Yangtze River. When the ship was near Jingzhou, it was caught in a storm and sank in approximately deep waters. The captain and the chief engineer said that the ship was hit by a tornado, and the China Meteorological Administration confirmed that a tornado occurred in Jianli County with wind-speeds reaching EF1 strength, or approximately . It was once widely believed that the tornado struck the river near the ship's location, but later investigation suggested that the tornado struck a location 8 km away and did not affect the ship; instead, based on Doppler radar data and other evidence, the official report found that a massive downburst in the thunderstorm, with gusts over (12–13 on the Beaufort scale), was the likely cause of the capsizing. == Passengers and crew == { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" style=\\"font-size:85%; text-align:right; margin:0 0 1.5em 1.5em;\\" + Passengers on board by region - ! style=\\"text-align:left; width:130px\\"  Region ! style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  No. -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Jiangsu  204 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Shanghai  97 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Tianjin  43 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Shandong  23 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Fujian  19 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Zhejiang  11 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Anhui  8 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Total  405 } Initially, the Chinese authorities reported 458 people were aboard the ship, but later reduced this figure to 456. This included 405 passengers, all of whom were Chinese and mostly elderly, 46 crew members and five tour guides. According to crew members that were rescued, the storm hit and capsized the ship quickly while most of the passengers were asleep. One rescued passenger stated that the ship had become flooded with water, and with the turbulent river conditions, capsized after experiencing a list greater than 45 degrees. Seven survivors were able to swim to shore and alert authorities about two and a half hours after capsizing. On 13 June, the Chinese authorities updated that 454, not 456, people were on board and 442 bodies had been found with 12 rescued. ===Analysis of the incident=== Severe weather reports were issued for the area, which should have subsequently been sent to all vessels on the river in the area for them to take necessary precautions. There is no confirmation that Dongfang zhi Xing had been properly notified, though at least one other vessel travelling nearby was shown to have taken precautions due to the weather warning. The ship's captain and chief engineer, two of the rescued persons, were taken into custody for questioning. The Chinese government censored news and discussion about this accident, while tightly controlling media coverage. The Politburo Standing Committee attempted to control public opinion about the disaster response, by issuing an order to both \\"understand the sorrow of the families\\" and \\"concretely preserve social stability\\" to their partymember officials. On 30 December 2015, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the incident. The report said that heavy storms caused Dongfang zhi Xing to capsize; it also found that the shipping company and local authorities had flaws in their daily management and suggested that 43 people be punished accordingly. ==Ship==  MV Dongfang zhi Xing was constructed in February 1994. In 1997 the ship's length was extended by . It underwent another retrofit in 2008 that cut its capacity from 584 to 534 people. As of 2015, the ship was long with a beam of . It was owned by the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corporation and operated by Xiehe Travel, where it made cruises within the Three Gorges area of inland China. Dongfang zhi Xing, as well as other Yangtze River cruise ships, had come under increasing government scrutiny in recent years due to the growing tourist industry in China. In 2013, Dongfang zhi Xing and five other ships were cited for safety violations by the Nanjing maritime bureau, though the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corporation did not comment on the nature of these infractions. ==Rescue== Rescue efforts were made immediately to save the passengers and crew, reaching full scale about twelve hours after the capsizing. 82 people had been confirmed dead by 4 June, with some bodies having washed ashore downstream from the wreck. Fourteen people were rescued in the immediate aftermath, including the ship's engineer and captain. According to a tweet from China Central Television (CCTV), rescuers were able to hear the sound of people trapped inside. CCTV reported that search teams heard people yelling from within the ship. 1,000 police officers from the Hubei Armed Police Corps were sent to the site with 40 inflatable boats. Authorities reported that the search and rescue effort included 3,000 people and 50 boats. Crews used both underwater approaches with diving apparatus, and above-water approaches through holes cut through the inverted hull. A typical cruise ship similar to Dongfang zhi Xing used to tour the Three Gorges rivers Additional search efforts were made to locate survivors or bodies up to downstream of the wreck. The Three Gorges Dam upriver was instructed to cut water flow rates by half in order to lower the river levels for the rescue effort. On 5 June, the inverted ship was fitted with cables and nets, and the holes cut in the hull sealed, in order to right the ship and resume the search for survivors or bodies. The search yielded only bodies. The search range was subsequently expanded to downstream on 5 June. The highest levels of the government were involved in the search coordination. Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang ordered rescue efforts.

He is the Communist Party Secretary and the Governor of Liaoning province. He formerly served as Director of the China Atomic Energy Authority, Director of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), and Vice-Minister of Industry and Information Technology. ==Early life and education== Chen Qiufa was born in December 1954 in Chengbu Miao Autonomous County, Hunan Province. He is a member of the Miao minority. He began working in March 1973 as a teacher at Lianxing Elementary School in Chengbu, and joined the Communist Party of China in September 1974. In September 1975, Chen entered the electrical engineering department of National University of Defense Technology in Changsha, majoring in radar countermeasure. He graduated in October 1978. ==Career== After university Chen worked for the Ministry of Aerospace Industry from 1978 to 1994, first as an engineer, and later as a manager. From 1994 to 1998 he worked for China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. From 1998 to 2000 he was Director of the education department of the Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND). He was Head of Commission for Discipline Inspection at COSTIND from 2000 to 2005. From 2005 to 2008 he was Deputy Director of COSTIND. When COSTIND was reorganized and merged into the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in 2008, he became Director of the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) under MIIT, as well as Vice-Minister of MIIT. He was also appointed Director of the China Atomic Energy Authority in 2008 and Director of the China National Space Administration in 2010. In January 2013, he left all his positions with MIIT and was tapped to become Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (PPCC) of his native Hunan Province, taking on a political office for the first time. He was also elected in November 2012 as a full member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. On May 4, 2015, Chen Qiufa was appointed Acting Governor and Deputy Party Secretary of Liaoning province, succeeding Li Xi, who was promoted to Party Secretary. Along with Ma Xingrui and Zhang Qingwei, Chen was one of a growing number of high regional officials in his generation who rose through the aerospace industry. Chen's appointment to Liaoning also demonstrated that being a provincial-level PPCC chief was no longer considered a \\"political retirement home\\" for older politicians, and that holders of this office could still be considered for further promotion.; He Lifeng is another prominent example of this arrangement. He was appointed as the Party Secretary of Liaoning in 2017. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Hunan Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Hunan Category:Governors of Liaoning Category:Miao people Category:Scientists from Hunan Category:Politicians from Shaoyang Category:Chinese aerospace engineers Category:National University of Defense Technology alumni Category:Political office-holders in Hunan Category:China National Space Administration people Category:Delegates to the 12th National People's Congress Category:Members of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Category:Members of the 12th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Category:Engineers from Hunan ","title":"Chen Qiufa"},{"id":"46870193","text":"Özhan Çıvgın (born June 6, 1979) is a Turkish professional basketball coach who is now coaching Turkish Basketball League team Arel Üniversitesi Büyükçekmece. ==External links== *Özhan Çıvgın Maçkolik Profile *Tüyap Büyükçekmece Career History Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Karşıyaka basketball coaches Category:Turkish basketball coaches ","title":"Özhan Çıvgın"},{"id":"46870204","text":"Homadaula albida is a moth in the family Galacticidae.

A businessman by career, Wilson was the manager of Falmouth Fruit Co-operative Ltd., and president of Evangeline Broadcasting Corporation. Wilson first attempted to enter provincial politics in 1949, finishing 3 votes ahead of Liberal George B. Cole on election night, but the Liberals asked for a recount. On June 18, a recount resulted in a tie between Wilson and Cole which was broken when the returning officer cast the deciding vote for Cole, declaring him elected by one vote. In January 1950, Wilson appealed the election result to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, where under the Nova Scotia Controverted Elections Act, the returning officer's decision was ruled an undue return and the election voided. A byelection was held on November 27, 1950, resulting in Wilson defeating Liberal William C. Dunlop by 806 votes. Wilson was re-elected in the 1953, 1956, and 1960 elections.

The museum opened to the public on 28 March 2019. The building, which was constructed in place of the original Qatar National Museum, was designed by architect Jean Nouvel who got his inspiration from the desert rose crystal, which can be found in Qatar. The museum site includes Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani's Palace, which is the heart of the Qatari national identity. ==Overview== The National Museum of Qatar (NMoQ) features an innovative design by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel that is inspired by the desert rose and grows around the original twentieth century palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani. The historic palace was restored by Berlin-based architecture and engineering firm ZRS Architekten Ingenieure. This important monument to Qatar's past is now preserved as the heart of the new NMoQ.National Museum of Qatar The relation between the new building and the old building is part of creating the bridge between the past and the present advocated by Sheikha Al Mayassa as a way to \\"define ourselves instead of forever being defined by others […]\\" and of \\"celebrating our identity\\". The 430,000 square foot (40,000 m²) museum is made up of interlocking discs that create cavities to protect visitors from the desert heat.Take a first look at the upcoming Qatar National Museum, 28 July 2011 Located on a 1.5 million ft² site at the south end of Doha's Corniche, the NMoQ building rises from the sea and is connected to the shore by two pedestrian bridges and a road bridge. Originally, the museum was scheduled to open in 2016, but its opening was pushed back to 28 March 2019. Time Magazine named it one of the World's Greatest Places to Visit in 2019, citing the integration of \\"immersive video screens and dioramas\\" into Jean Nouvel's architectural design. The museum welcomed more than 450,000 visitors in less than a year of its opening. The museum attracts people as it depicts Qatar’s history not through paintings and sculptures but with 21st-century lights, sounds and visuals. ==Contractor== The main building was contracted to Hyundai E&C; in 2011. The project involved the construction of the new National Museum next to the existing Qatar National Museum, which is located across from the Corniche. The museum is designed according to the Bedouin tradition of Qatar. It includes a building in the shape of a desert rose and a 1.2 million ft² landscaped park. The project also includes a 115,000 m² park with an artificial lagoon and parking spaces for 400 vehicles, a 220-seat auditorium, a research centre, laboratories, a dedicated food forum, two restaurants, a café, and two museum shops, one for children. ==Collection== A tour of the museum takes visitors through a loop of galleries that address three major, interrelated themes. The galleries are loosely arranged in chronological order, beginning with exhibitions on the natural history of the desert and the Persian Gulf, artefacts from Bedouin culture, historical exhibitions on the tribal wars, the establishment of the Qatari state, and finally the discovery of oil to the present.Celebrating the Delicate Beauty of the Desert Landscape by NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF in The New York Times, 22 March 2010 The displays and installations that explore these themes present audiovisual displays with carefully selected treasures from the museum's collections. These collections currently consist of approximately 8,000 objects and include archaeological artefacts, architectural elements, heritage household and travelling objects, textiles and costumes, jewellery, decorative arts, books, and historical documents.Qatar Museums Authority Unveils Jean Nouvel Design for New Museum in the ArtDaily The museum's mission is to celebrate the culture, heritage, and future of Qatar and its people, embodying the pride and traditions of Qataris while offering international visitors a dialogue about rapid change and modernization.New Qatar National Museum…a journey in a world of fantasy! ==Gallery== National Museum of Qatar under construction.jpgConstruction of National Museum of Qatar in 2015 Elevated view of construction of National Museum of Qatar in 2017.pngElevated view of construction of the National Museum of Qatar in 2017 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Museums in Qatar Category:Decorative arts museums Category:Islamic museums Category:Jean Nouvel buildings Category:Religious museums in Qatar Category:Buildings and structures in Doha Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2019 ","title":"National Museum of Qatar"},{"id":"46870484","text":"Harley James Spence (November 27, 1904 – April 27, 1993) was a Canadian politician.

In non-metals, the valence band is the highest range of electron energies in which electrons are normally present at absolute zero temperature, while the conduction band is the lowest range of vacant electronic states. On a graph of the electronic band structure of a material, the valence band is located below the Fermi level, while the conduction band is located above it. The distinction between the valence and conduction bands is meaningless in metals, because conduction occurs in one or more partially filled bands that take on the properties of both the valence and conduction bands. == Band gap == In semiconductors and insulators the two bands are separated by a band gap, while in semimetals the bands overlap. A band gap is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist due to the quantization of energy. Electrical conductivity of non-metals is determined by the susceptibility of electrons to be excited from the valence band to the conduction band. == Electrical conductivity == Image:Semiconductor band structure (lots of bands 2).svg Semiconductor band structure See electrical conduction and semiconductor for a more detailed description of band structure. In solids, the ability of electrons to act as charge carriers depends on the availability of vacant electronic states. This allows the electrons to increase their energy (i.e., accelerate) when an electric field is applied. Similarly, holes (empty states) in the almost filled valence band also allow for conductivity. As such, the electrical conductivity of a solid depends on its capability to flow electrons from the valence to the conduction band. Hence, in the case of a semimetal with an overlap region, the electrical conductivity is high. If there is a small band gap (Eg), then the flow of electrons from valence to conduction band is possible only if an external energy (thermal, etc.) is supplied; these groups with small Eg are called semiconductors. If the Eg is sufficiently high, then the flow of electrons from valence to conduction band becomes negligible under normal conditions; these groups are called insulators. There is some conductivity in semiconductors, however. This is due to thermal excitation—some of the electrons get enough energy to jump the band gap in one go. Once they are in the conduction band, they can conduct electricity, as can the hole they left behind in the valence band. The hole is an empty state that allows electrons in the valence band some degree of freedom. ==See also== *Electrical conduction for more information about conduction in solids, and another description of band structure. *Fermi sea *Semiconductor for a full explanation of the band structure of materials. *HOMO/LUMO *Valleytronics ==References== * * * ==External links== *Direct Band Gap Energy Calculator Category:Electronic band structures ","title":"Valence and conduction bands"},{"id":"46870558","text":"William Harvey Pipe (December 3, 1914 – December 17, 1987) was a Canadian politician.

The United States Judo Federation (USJF) started in 1952. The concentration of the USJF is on the east and west coasts, but also in Chicago and Hawaii. The United States Judo Association (USJA) was founded in 1968 as an extension of the Armed Forces Judo Association (AFJA) when it broke off from the USJF to focus on a more Americanized structure. The USJA is mostly concentrated in California and Florida, but also popular in the Midwest and Southeast. The United States Judo, Inc. (USJI), doing business as USA Judo, was founded in 1978 and has its headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It may be slightly larger than the USJA and USJF, as they have crossover members from both of these organizations, since they are the designated national governing body of the USOC for the Olympics. The sport was first introduced to the United States in about 1902 when then US President, Theodore Roosevelt, practiced in the White House. Judo began to develop in the 1950s when it became required for the US Air Force. After these advances it was officially recognized as an AAU sport, and there have been national competitions and tournaments ever since. The United States formed an Olympic team and competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics, which it continues to do to this day. Judo is now practiced by and estimated 100,000 American men, women, and children (25,000 registered in either the USJA, USJF, and USA Judo). ==History== America's first major contact exposure to judo came through President Ulysses S. Grant in 1879. He was in Japan for a state visit and observed a judo demonstration. In 1889, Kanō Jigorō gave a lecture on the philosophy of judo to several Americans; however, the lecture had little effect on mainstream judo growth. The first American to actually study judo was Prof. Ladd from Yale University, in 1889. He trained at the Kodokan in Japan for about ten years; by 1908 about 13 Americans were training there. In 1919, Prof. John Dewey of Columbia University came to visit Prof. Ladd and Master Kano, many years later he took his knowledge back to Columbia and began the first U.S. college judo program. While some students were training in Japan there was some action in the U.S. Perhaps one of the most important figures in the U.S. development of judo is Yamashita Yoshitsugu, who came to the U.S. in 1902 in order to teach judo to the Japanese community. Yoshiaki ended up teaching Senator James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr.'s wife, who happened to attend the same country club as Theodore Roosevelt. Mrs. Wadsworth told Roosevelt about judo, and he became interested in the sport. Yoshiaki was subsequently invited to Washington to give a demonstration at the White House. There was a contest with a wrestler by the name of John Graft, who was the coach at the U.S. Naval Academy and who was teaching President Roosevelt wrestling. Although Yoshiaki threw him time after time, Graft continued to get up. Finally, Yoshiaki decided that he would do mat work with Graft, since there seemed to be no end to the match. Yoshiaki got an armlock on Graft, but the wrestler would not give up. Yoshiaki kept up the pressure until Graft groaned as his arm came close to breaking. President Roosevelt was impressed and took judo lessons. After leaving office, he kept mats in his home. He studied judo for about a year, earning a brown belt. Through the help of the president, Yoshiaki taught judo at the naval academy. Judo suddenly had its first strong roots in the United States. Yoshiaki decided to return to Japan, but other Japanese Judo participants followed his example. The judo concentration was mainly centered in Washington before World War II, but several centers existed on the west coast, including Tokugoro Ito's dojo in Los Angeles, which was founded in 1910. Judo first entered the Western United States when Dr. T Ito began teaching Judo in Denver in the 1930s. During World War II Judo was banned in many areas due to the Japanese fear; however, a boom followed the war. Many servicemen picked up martial arts during the war and returned home to teach them all across the country. The official judo federations formed in the 50s and 60s. ==Olympics== The United States is not a major power in judo.

Both sides attempt to destroy the other's base by sending troops towards it. Each base has a certain number of hit points; once those drop to zero, the base is destroyed and that side loses the game. The player draws cards from a virtual deck representing units. These units have numbers, while the player is given a set of numbers at the start of each turn. The player must perform mathematical equations to make their set of numbers equal the numbers on the cards, at which time they can deploy that particular card. The player receives bonuses if they are able to use the entire set of numbers in a single turn, which increase for each turn they can use all the numbers. == Plot == The player plays as the \\"Star Nerd\\", a human soldier who travels across the galaxy attempting to conquer various planets that are ruled by warlords. == Development == The game's creator, Seanbaby, was inspired to develop the game because he thought CCG video games were \\"sort of a mess\\" and wanted to improve on them. He added the math equations to the game because he believed there was \\"something satisfying in having equations to work out\\". He did not mind if the math problems reduced the game's commercial appeal, saying that while he hoped the game was successful, his primary motivation was to have fun developing the game, and that those who were mainly motivated by making a commercially appealing game were \\"probably an asshole\\". == Reception == The game was positively received by critics, with an aggregate score of 83 on Metacritic. Zack Kotzer of Kill Screen noted that while the game was \\"not edutainment\\", it still made him \\"feel like a math hero of the universe\\" and \\"more confident in [his] relationship with numbers\\". == References == Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Action video games Category:2014 video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Calculords"},{"id":"46870769","text":"Kenneth Campbell (March 26, 1881 – March 28, 1951) was a Canadian politician.

His first film was the critical and commercial hit The Attorney (2013). == Career == Born in Seoul in 1969, Yang Woo-suk graduated from Korea University with degrees in English Literature and Philosophy. He became a cartoonist, writing webtoons such as If Thou Must Love Me (2008-2009) and Steel Rain (2011-2012). Yang also began working in the film industry mainly as a producer for the companies MBC Productions, SK Independence, and All That Story, doing such tasks as production planning, investment supervision and recruiting new directors. He became interested in film technology and taught himself about HD and CGI; he produced the HD film Desire in 2004 and became the creative planning director at computer graphics company Locus. Yang's debut as a filmmaker came relatively late in life in his mid-forties, when he co-wrote and directed courtroom drama The Attorney, a fictionalized account of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's early years as a human rights lawyer in 1980s Busan. It was loosely based on the \\"Burim\\" case of 1981, when the Chun Doo-hwan regime arrested without warrants 22 students and teachers who belonged to a book-reading club on charges that they were North Korea sympathizers. Yang said, \\"I am interested in films that tell stories of people who struggle hard to stick to their beliefs when they come into conflict with outside environments. [...] I wanted to grasp the very moment when a man dramatically and radically changed.\\" At first Yang had difficulty getting funding for a film with real-life historical figures given the sensitive political climate, but those pre-production budgetary woes eased when top actor Song Kang-ho was cast as the protagonist. Released in late 2013, The Attorney became an unexpected box office sensation, drawing 11,375,954 admissions as it reminded older viewers of the country's politically charged past and provided younger viewers with a window into that era. It became the ninth film in Korean cinema history to reach 10 million admissions, and became (at the time) the 8th highest grossing Korean film of all time. The Attorney received multiple awards and nominations domestically, particularly for Song who received rave reviews for his performance. Notably, it won four awards at the 35th Blue Dragon Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor for Song, Best Supporting Actress for Kim Young-ae, and Popular Star Award for Yim Si- wan. Yang also won several Best New Director prizes, from the 19th Chunsa Film Art Awards, the 50th Baeksang Arts Awards (where Song won the Grand Prize and The Attorney won Best Film), the 14th Director's Cut Awards, the 34th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards, and the 51st Grand Bell Awards (where Yang also won Best Screenplay). == Filmography == {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:33px;\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Film ! colspan=\\"3\\"Credited as ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Notes - ! width=65  Director ! width=65 Writer ! width=65 Producer -  2004  Desire     -  2013  The Attorney     -  2017  Steel Rain     -  2020  Steel Rain 2: Summit     } == Webtoons == *If Thou Must Love Me (2008-2009) *V (2009) *Steel Rain (2011-2012) == Awards == *2014 19th Chunsa Film Art Awards: Best New Director (The Attorney) *2014 50th Baeksang Arts Awards: Best New Director (The Attorney) *2014 14th Director's Cut Awards: Best New Director (The Attorney) *2014 34th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards: Best New Director (The Attorney) *2014 51st Grand Bell Awards: Best New Director; Best Screenplay (The Attorney) == References  External links == * * * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean film directors Category:South Korean screenwriters Category:South Korean webtoon creators Category:South Korean manhwa artists Category:South Korean manhwa writers Category:Korea University alumni Category:People from Seoul ","title":"Yang Woo-suk"},{"id":"46870943","text":"John P.

Apollo asteroids are the largest subgroup of near-Earth objects. Unlike many Apollo asteroids, this asteroid is not a Mars-crosser, as its aphelion is smaller than the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU. This asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.97–1.59 AU once every 17 months (531 days; semi-major axis of 1.28 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 0° with respect to the ecliptic.

It is performed by Louis, Tiana and Naveen [as frogs], when they are sailing down a river and fantasizing about what they will do when they become human. It was composed by Randy Newman and co-orchestrated by Jonathan Sacks, and features Michael-Leon Wooley (as Louis), Bruno Campos (as Prince Naveen) and Anika Noni Rose (as Tiana). It \\"is in the style of jazz\\", while having \\" a Mardi Gras party sound\\". The trumpet solos are performed by Terence Blanchard on behalf of his horn-blowing animated alter ego Louis the Alligator. ==Analysis== This song continues a recurring theme in Disney movies about characters' \\"humanity [being] cursed away\\". In particular, the song \\"Human Again\\" from Beauty and the Beast is thematically similar to this one. The Chicago Tribune notes \\"The song's story purpose is similar to \\"Human Again,\\" cut from Disney's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" but interpolated into the stage version\\", and also describes it as \\"in the spirit of \\"Hakuna Matata\\". While \\"in no previous Disney film is any princess ever transformed into an animal\\", a \\"longing to be human\\" theme is evident in many Disney films, and \\"there is almost always a song about it: Ariel, The Beast and his servants, King Louie, and others all sing about wanting to be human---and therefore to be better than their lowly non-human form\\". In general, \\"animals who behave like humans in Disney films are always coded as protagonists...and humans who behave like animals are always antagonists\\", with \\"animal\\" often being coded as a non-white race. The two non-white leads when 2/3rds of the film as frogs and desire to be human - the implication is that they are not allowed to be coloured in their own film, and must \\"long to “fix” their doubly errant color and species throughout the film---again, with a significant racial subtext\\". CBN says that the philosophy of karma is evident in the song, due to Tiana's lyric: \\"If you do your best, each and every day, good things are sure to come your way. What you give is what you get.\\" Contemporary Black American Cinema: Race, Gender and Sexuality at the Movies notes that Louis sings about wanting to be human so he can play in a jazz band, due to his attempt to \\"jam...with the big boys\\" in his current form not \\"end[ing] well\\". The book say that this is a metaphor for \\"how blacks existed and learned to improvise under the condition of being deemed less than human\\". It says that under the surface, it can be read as \\"about he claim for black humanity\\". ==Plot== At this point in the movie, Louis, Tiana and Naveen are off down the bayou to visit Voodoo Queen Mama Odie, in order for her to change each of them into humans. There are no obstacles presented in their way, and they use this time to sing about what they will do once their wish has been granted. At face value, the song is about the characters \\"singing about their desires to become human again [while] reaching Mama Odie and reversing the curse of Dr. Facilier. ==Reception== Acting for Animators described \\"When We're Human\\" as \\"fun and lively production number\\". IGN deemed it \\"perhaps the least interesting song in the film\\". Entertainment Weekly described it as a song of \\"optimism\\", while Marshall and the Movies said the three characters are \\"jovially longing\\". FilmScore ClickTrack cited this as a prime example of the film's clever orchestrations, and described the musical style as \\"Dixieland\\". Collider deemed it a \\"standout\\" along with Ne-yo's closing theme Never Knew I Needed. the Chicago Tribune said the \\"kicky\\" Randy Newman song \\"end[s] up being just sort of ... all right\\". Rope Of Silicon deemed it \\"perhaps the catchiest of the bunch\\". TrackSounds described it as \\"equally fun\\" when comparing it to Bare Necessities from the Disney film The Jungle Book, and rated it 5/5 stars. Game deemed it \\"incredibly energetic\\" and also noted it was \\"refreshingly evocative of The Jungle Book's 'Bare Necessities'\\". BlogCritics wrote \\"“When We’re Human” calls to mind “The Bare Necessities\\". DVDTalk said it was \\"the first perfect musical number in the movie\\", and \\"made [the reviewer] think of \\"The Bare Necessities\\". \\" Opinion Prone said it \\"seemed like a pretty typical Disney song.\\" AnimatedReviews said it \\"is especially by the numbers, even if it is jaunty enough and fun to be seeing such material on the screen again\\". MovieMouseReviews said that during this song, \\"suddenly you feel that old fuzzy Disney musical feeling and “Princess and the Frog” becomes a success.\\" Silver Screen Reviews said it, along with \\"Down in New Orleans\\", \\"really hit it out of the park in terms of context to the film and its characters\\". ==References== Category:Songs from The Princess and the Frog Category:2009 songs Category:Songs written by Randy Newman ","title":"When We're Human"},{"id":"46871099","text":"Cortinarius pseudocupreorufus is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium).
