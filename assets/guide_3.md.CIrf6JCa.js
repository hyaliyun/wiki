Although still small in absolute numbers (10,402 at the 2001 census), Buddhism in Austria enjoys widespread acceptance. A majority of Buddhists in the country are Austrian nationals (some of them naturalized after immigration from Asia, predominantly from the People's Republic of China and Vietnam), while a considerable number of them are foreign nationals. As in most European countries, different branches and schools of Buddhism are represented by groups of varying sizes. Vienna not only has the largest number of foreign residents, but is also the place with the longest tradition of Buddhism in the country. Most of Austria's Buddhist temples and centres of practice can be found there; some with a specific Chinese, Vietnamese, Tibetan or Japanese appearance. The latest development has been the establishment of a “Buddhist Cemetery” around a stupa-like building for funeral ceremonies at the Vienna Central Cemetery. Buddhism was officially recognized under Austrian law in 1983. Russia is the only other \\"European\\" country to recognize Buddhism formally as \\"native\\" to its own soil, giving it official status, along with Orthodox Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. ==History== ===Early years=== By the late 19th century, due to the influence of Arthur Schopenhauer and Richard Wagner, artists and intellectuals in Vienna had started to take an interest in Buddhism. Karl Eugen Neumann (1865–1915), who had met the composer Wagner in his father's house, took great interest in what he had heard about Buddhism. In 1884 he decided to become a Buddhist and to study the original languages to be able \\"to see for himself\\". He translated large parts of the Pali Canon into German before dying in Vienna at the age of 50.Volker Zotz: Auf den glückseligen Inseln. Buddhismus in der deutschen Kultur. Theseus, Berlin 2000, p. 90-101 () In 1913 in Java, Arthur Fitz, a man from Graz, became the first recorded Austrian to be ordained as a Buddhist monk, taking the name Bhikkhu Sono. 1923 saw the foundation of a \\"Buddhist Society\\" in Vienna; and Austrians were among the participants at the 2nd International Buddhist Congress in Paris in 1937. The political situation in Austria -- an alliance between the Fascist regime and the Catholic Church from 1933 to 1938 followed by Hitler's conquest of Austria and the Second World War -- was highly unfavourable to the development of Austrian Buddhism. ===Since World War II=== The Peace Pagoda, a stupa in Vienna, Austria. In 1949 the \\"Buddhist Society of Vienna\\" was founded, and interest in Buddhism started to flourish again. Due to personalities like Fritz Hungerleider, who had returned from exile in the People's Republic of China in 1955 to become the society's president, and Dr Walter Karwath, who had spent years in Asia practicing medicine, Buddhism took a step out of literary and intellectual circles toward the broader world. The late 1970s saw the establishment of Dannebergplatz, the first Buddhist Centre in Vienna; the purchase of a rural property intended to become a retreat centre (Buddhist Centre Scheibbs); and the establishment of the first Buddhist Association outside Vienna (the Salzburg Buddhist Association), founded by Friedrich Fenzl, who had been a student at the Ryukoku University in Kyoto and who invited Kosho Otani, the Patriarch of the Nishi-Honganji branch of Jodo Shinshu, to visit Austria. Hemaloka Thero, Geshe Rabten, the 16th Karmapa, the 14th Dalai Lama and other eminent representatives from different Buddhist traditions visited the country, gave talks, and attracted dharma students. In 1979, Genro Koudela, who was ordained as a Zen priest in California by Joshu Sasaki, returned to Vienna, his city of origin, and established the \\"Bodhidharma Zendo\\" there. The new Buddhist Centre at Fleischmarkt, in the very centre of Vienna, became the home for Zen, Kagyu and Theravada groups. Since 1981 there is a branch of the Arya Maitreya Mandala in Austria, which was founded by Lama Anagarika Govinda.Arya Maitreya Mandala in Austria ===Buddhism recognized=== Buddhist Cemetery at the Vienna Zentralfriedhof Official recognition by the government in early 1983 ushered in a new era of Austrian Buddhism. A widely visible \\"Peace Stupa\\" was opened on the banks of the river Danube; and a retreat and study centre, Letzehof, affiliated with the Geluk school of Tibetan Buddhism, was opened in the western province of Vorarlberg. Vanja Palmers, a Zen monk of the Japanese Sōtō school, and Brother David Steindl-Rast, an Austrian-American Benedictine monk, founded a retreat centre high up in the Salzburg alpine region. The first centre in the south of the country, a retreat centre in the Burmese Theravada tradition, was established in the early 1990s. In 1993, Austria hosted an annual general meeting of the European Buddhist Union, which drew participants from a dozen European countries. A series of visits to the city of Graz by the Dalai Lama in 1995, 1998 (for the consecration of a large stupa), and in 2002 (to speak on \\"Kalachakra for World Peace\\") were a strong encouragement for Buddhists in Austria. ===Buddhist religious instruction at Austrian schools=== Official recognition also opened the doors for Buddhist religious education at schools. In 1993, the first few groups of children were given the chance to hear about the Buddhadharma on a regular basis as part of their syllabus. Twelve years after the project was started in the cities of Vienna, Graz and Salzburg, Buddhist religious education is being made available to school children of all age groups (6 to 19) at different types of schools in all of nine federal provinces of the Republic. A Teachers’ Training Academy was founded in 2001 to offer in-service teacher training for the teachers concerned. ==See also== *Culture of Austria ==Notes and references== ==External links== Most links are in German only.

The group originally consisted of members Jerry Davison (drums, lead vocals), Mark Blackburn (guitar, lead vocals), and Steve Atwell (bass). ==Biography== In 1989, Jacob's Trouble released their debut, Terry Taylor- produced album, The Door Into Summer, a mixture of original numbers and cover versions of songs by The Beatles and The Monkees. A year later the band released their second album, Knock, Breathe, Shine. The band received notice at the time for the song \\"About Sex\\", a song about the proper role of sex in society from a Christian perspective. Fearing a fundamentalist label, the band opted to remove the song from the album and replaced it with the more ambiguous \\"About Sex, Part 2\\". Despite this, the album was the group's best- selling record. They performed \\"About Sex\\" during a concert at Dellinger Park in Cartersville, GA. One of Jacob's Trouble's songs, \\"These Thousand Hills\\", was given much wider exposure when Third Day performed a cover of the song on their album Offerings. Jacob's Trouble was referred to as \\"being a band ahead of its time.\\" After their second album the group added two new members (Ron Cochran on drums and guitarist Keith Johnston), allowing Davison to become the band's principal singer. The new line-up recorded the album ...let the Truth Run Wild! After the album's release Blackburn left the band. The band went on to record one more record, the self-titled Jacob's Trouble. Jacob's Trouble split after their fourth album and its subsequent tour. A collection of \\"rarities\\" was released in 1994 entitled Diggin' Up Bones, which featured the long-lost \\"About Sex\\". The group reunited briefly in 1998 to record a new song, \\"Step by Step,\\" for a compilation album called The Jacob's Trouble Sampler Pak. Atwell, Johnston, and Cochran continue to record together under the name Janah. Jerry Davison recorded one CD under the name sideways8 in 1998 and occasionally releases songs via such Internet music sites as garageband.com and IUMA.com. He currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia where he serves as Creative Arts Pastor for Church at the Ridge in Hiram, GA. Mark Blackburn released two solo albums, Flowerchild (1996) and The Continuing Adventures of.... (1997). Blackburn is pastor of a church, Area251/Reallife Church, in his hometown of Dallas, Georgia. ==Discography== * Jacob's Trouble EP (cassette only) (1988) * Door into Summer (Aug. 1989) * Knock, Breathe, Shine (Aug. 1990) * ...let the Truth Run Wild!

Human serum albumin is encoded by the ALB gene. Other mammalian forms, such as bovine serum albumin, are chemically similar. Serum albumin is produced by the liver, occurs dissolved in blood plasma and is the most abundant blood protein in mammals. Albumin is essential for maintaining the oncotic pressure needed for proper distribution of body fluids between blood vessels and body tissues; without albumin, the high pressure in the blood vessels would force more fluids out into the tissues. It also acts as a plasma carrier by non-specifically binding several hydrophobic steroid hormones and as a transport protein for hemin and fatty acids. Too much or too little circulating serum albumin may be harmful. Albumin in the urine usually denotes the presence of kidney disease. Occasionally albumin appears in the urine of normal persons following long periods of standing (postural albuminuria). == Function == Albumin functions primarily as a carrier protein for steroids, fatty acids, and thyroid hormones in the blood and plays a major role in stabilizing extracellular fluid volume by contributing to oncotic pressure (known also as colloid osmotic pressure) of plasma. Because smaller animals (for example rats) function at a lower blood pressure, they need less oncotic pressure to balance this, and thus need less albumin to maintain proper fluid distribution. ==Synthesis== Albumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin which has an N-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The product, proalbumin, is in turn cleaved in the Golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin. == Properties == Albumin is a globular, water-soluble, un-glycosylated serum protein of approximate molecular weight of 65,000 Daltons. Albumin (when ionized in water at pH 7.4, as found in the body) is negatively charged. The glomerular basement membrane is also negatively charged in the body; some studies suggest that this prevents the filtration of albumin in the urine. According to this theory, that charge plays a major role in the selective exclusion of albumin from the glomerular filtrate. A defect in this property results in nephrotic syndrome leading to albumin loss in the urine. Nephrotic syndrome patients are sometimes given albumin to replace the lost albumin. == Structure == The general structure of albumin is characterized by several long α helices allowing it to maintain a relatively static shape, which is essential for regulating blood pressure. Serum albumin contains eleven distinct binding domains for hydrophobic compounds. One hemin and six long-chain fatty acids can bind to serum albumin at the same time. == Types == Serum albumin is widely distributed in mammals. * The human version is human serum albumin. * Bovine serum albumin, or BSA, is commonly used in immunodiagnostic procedures, clinical chemistry reagents, cell culture media, protein chemistry research (including venom toxicity), and molecular biology laboratories (usually to leverage its non-specific protein binding properties). == See also == * Human serum albumin * Bovine serum albumin * Blood plasma fractionation * Chromatography in blood processing * Lactalbumin * Ovalbumin == References == == External links == * RCSB Protein Data Bank : Molecule of the Month – Serum Albumin * Albumin binding prediction * Category:Blood proteins ","title":"Serum albumin"},{"id":"1437474","text":"Anjali is a 1990 Indian Tamil-language drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam. It stars Raghuvaran, Revathi, Master Tarun, Baby Shruti Vijaykumar and Baby Shamili in the leading roles. The background score and soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. Anjali was the composer's 500th film. The film deals with the story of a dying mentally disabled child, and the emotional trauma experienced by her family. The film was dubbed into Hindi and Telugu and released under the same name. Anjali was critically acclaimed, winning three National Film Awards. It was chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars in 1991, but was not nominated. This film is remade in Sinhala as Doni. ==Plot== Civil engineer Shekhar lives with his wife Chitra and their two young children Arjun and Anu. Chitra delivers her third child, but the daughter is claimed to be stillborn. Two years later, Shekar and his family move to a new apartment complex. The family seems to have moved on from their grief due to the stillborn child incident and live happily. After a few altercations with the kids in the colony, Arjun and Anu are accepted by all the kids as their own. The kids are all for pulling pranks and generally causing a clamor around the apartment colony. One such constant joke, they play on a mentally disabled ex- watchman of the colony, much to the chagrin of his wife. The only tenant they are afraid of is an ex-convict, who lives alone in one of the apartments. On one particular day, Chitra and the kids decided to surprise Shekhar by meeting him at his construction area, unannounced. Nevertheless, on coming to the site, they learned from one of the construction workers that Shekhar has left to conduct an emergency matter elsewhere. When Shekhar returns home for dinner that night, Chitra casually asks him where he was on that day, to which he replies that he was at the construction site the whole day. Chitra feels hurt to hear Shekhar lying and leaves the dining hall. Arjun and Anu too sense that their father is lying to them and leave the place. Nevertheless, before leaving the room, Anu blurts out accusations on her father, saying that he's lying about being at the site the whole day. Shekhar apologises to Chitra and consoles her and they both make up. On New Year's Eve, Arjun slips out late at night with the older children to celebrate while Shekhar is out of town on a business trip. Nevertheless, while dancing with his friends on the road, Arjun sees Shekhar with another woman and is shocked to know that his father has lied to them about going out of the town. Later, Arjun and the other children are hauled by the police back to their homes. Chitra is furious to learn about Arjun's escapade and when Shekhar comes back, asks him to punish Arjun. While Shekhar inquires him about the incident, Arjun, who was still angry at his father, blurts out that he saw Shekhar with another woman on New Year's Eve. Chitra and Anu become shocked on hearing about the incident. Chitra then starts suspecting that Shekhar is having affair with another woman and confronts him about it, but Shekhar swears on both his kids that he is not. A few days later, while on the bus, Chitra spots Shekhar talking to a woman (Saranya Ponvannan). She gets out of the bus and confronts him. Without waiting for his explanations, she rushes back home, packs her bags and threatens to walk out of the house with her kids. Shekhar pleads her to stay but she doesn't stop. Finally, Shekhar comes clean. Their third child, Anjali (Shamili), was born mentally ill and with a terminal illness a few years ago. The doctors did not give the child more than a couple of months to live. To avoid the sadness for a couple of months from an already physically exhausted Chitra and to protect his children from the trauma, he colludes with the doctors to lie to his family that the child was stillborn. But much to the surprise of everyone, the child has made it past her second birthday and is seemingly physically healthy. The woman Shekar was talking to is Anjali's doctor. Although Chitra is saddened by this betrayal, she decides to bring Anjali back home. Anjali is not like a normal child and requires constant attention from both the parents. This causes the other two siblings to dislike Anjali. Moreover, the other kids in the colony and school tease them by making fun of Anjali's condition. One day, the other kids in the colony make fun of Anjali by tying a string of cans behind her. This causes Arjun to fight with the other kids. He gets bruised which saddens Anjali, but a special bond is born between the siblings. Arjun becomes protective of her and challenges the other kids in the colony to a fight if they can't accept her. The kids accept Anjali and all the kids come to love her. This causes the parents of the kids to worry as they don't want their kids to be close with a mentally disabled child. During an apartment association meeting, the parents of the kids demand that Shekar and Chitra either leave the apartment or institutionalize Anjali. The only person to argue for Anjali's presence is the ex-convict. The parents are afraid of him and let it go. But soon, Anjali wins over everyone in the apartment complex and everyone comes to like her. Meanwhile, Shekhar, during a late-night visit to his construction site with Chitra and Anjali, is witness to a murder. He reports this to the police and the murderer is arrested. The murderer is enraged and visits Shekar's house after getting out on bail. He physically assaults and plans on killing Shekhar. But the ex-convict comes to the rescue and kills the murderer in the altercation when he threatens Shekhar's family and is arrested. The ex-convict thanks Shekhar before leaving as Anjali was the only person to show compassion to him. The next morning, Anu wakes up and goes to wake up Anjali, but she doesn't get up. Anjali had died in her sleep. As more and more people come after hearing Anu's screams, they all are saddened by the demise of the girl who taught them acceptance and forgiveness. ==Cast== * Shamili as Anjali * Revathi as Chitra * Raghuvaran as Shekar * Tarun Kumar as Arjun * Shruti Vijaykumar as Anu * Saranya Ponvannan as Doctor (uncredited) * Prabhu as the ex-convict Dennis Joseph * V.

While Revathi was finalised for the female lead, Mohan was originally considered for playing the male lead, but he refused as he believed his fans would not accept seeing him as \\"the father of two kids\\". Hence, Raghuvaran was chosen. Anjali was also Ratnam's first film since Mouna Ragam (1986) without P. C. Sreeram as cinematographer, for which he used Madhu Ambat instead. Ambat said he agreed to work on the film because he liked Ratnam's earlier work. B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan served as editors. Shamili was three years old while doing this film. The crew had difficulty to get the character right for her, so they found the solution by recording videos of a special child. Shamili's father put in a lot of effort and he would make her watch every day to observe the actions of the child. ==Release and reception== Anjali was released on 12 July 1990. The following day, N. Krishnaswamy wrote for The Indian Express that \\"directing so many kids must have been such a difficult task ... and [Mani Ratnam] has been so successful in this department.\\" On 5 August 1990, Ananda Vikatan overwhelmingly appreciated the film, rating it 58 out of 100. Bangalore Mirror reported that the film was inspired by the 1979 televised docudrama Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love. ==Accolades== ===National Film Awards (1991)=== * Won - Silver Lotus Award - Best Child Artist - Shamili, Tarun, Shruti * Won - Silver Lotus Award - Best Audiography - Pandu Rangan * Won - Silver Lotus Award - National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil - Anjali - G.

He is a former Chairman of the Pensions Commission and the Committee on Climate Change, as well as a former Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry. He has described himself in a BBC HARDtalk interview with Stephen Sackur as a 'technocrat'. He is a vocal advocate of the so-called \\"helicopter money\\" idea whereby central banks would directly finance government spending or cash distribution to citizens. Since 2010, he has written monthly opinion columns on economic and regulatory policy for Project Syndicate. ==Early life== Adair Turner was born in Ipswich. He grew up in Crawley and East Kilbride (both new towns. His father Geoffrey was a University of Liverpool-educated town planner). Adair attended Hutchesons' Grammar School in Glasgow, then moved to Glenalmond College. He later went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took a Double first in History and Economics and became President of the Cambridge Union. He was also Chairman of the University's Conservative Association. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. ==Business career== CBI Climate Change Summit 2008 He taught economics part-time after university. His career with BP started in 1979 and he worked for Chase Manhattan Bank from 1979 to 1982. He became a director of McKinsey & Co in 1994 after joining in 1982. Turner was Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) from 1995 to 1999. In this role he became one of the leading proponents of British membership of the euro – a stance he later said was mistaken. From 2000 to 2006 he was Vice-Chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe. He lectures part- time at the London School of Economics, where in 2010 he delivered three lectures on \\"Economics after the Crisis\\", later published by MIT Press as a book under that title: this criticised conventional wisdom that the object of policy should be to maximise GDP, that the way to do this is to promote freer markets, and that inequality is an acceptable price for growth.See review by Robert Skidelsky in the Times Literary Supplement 28 September 2012, pp. 9–10. In 2002, he chaired a UK government enquiry into pensions. In 2007, he succeeded Frances Cairncross as Chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council and Baroness Jay as Chair of the Overseas Development Institute's Council. In 2008 his Building a Low-carbon Economy (co-written with David Kennedy) was published, and the same year Turner was appointed as first Chairman of the British Government's newly established Committee on Climate Change. He stepped down from this position in Spring 2012. On 29 May 2008, it was announced that he would take over as Chairman of the Financial Services Authority. He took up this post on 20 September 2008 for a five-year term to succeed Callum McCarthy. ==Financial Services Authority== Turner defended the actions of the regulator on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on 15 February 2009, saying that other regulatory bodies throughout the world, which varied in structure and lightness of regulatory touch, also failed to predict the economic collapse. He said that in line with other regulators the FSA had failed intellectually by focusing too much on processes and procedures rather than looking at the bigger economic picture. Asked why Sir James Crosby had been appointed deputy chairman when the FSA had said that his bank HBOS was using risky lending practices, Lord Turner said that they had files on almost every financial institution indicating a degree of risk. He did not apologise for the actions of the FSA, which had presided over the near-total collapse of several major banks, and accepted that it had not foreseen the consequences for Lloyds Bank of its merger with the ailing HBOS in September 2008. Despite controversy over bonuses for employees of Lloyds, he sought to justify bonuses averaging 15 per cent for his own 2,500 staff, arguing \\"If you're saying we should now cut the bonuses [of FSA employees], you're saying you should cut their pay by 15%\\". In August 2009 in an interview for Prospect magazine he supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions (the \\"Tobin tax\\"), warning that a \\"swollen\\" financial sector paying excessive salaries had grown too big for society.Financial Times, 27 August 2009 (www.ft.com). ==Institute for New Economic Thinking== In April 2013, it was announced that Lord Turner would be joining George Soros' economic think tank as a senior research fellow in its London offices. From that, he wrote a book \\"Between Debt and the Devil: Money, Credit, and Fixing Global Finance\\" Princeton University Press, 2016 ==Global Apollo Programme== In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025. ==Honoured== On 7 September 2005 he was created a life peer as Baron Turner of Ecchinswell, of Ecchinswell in the County of Hampshire, awarded in recognition of his public service to the nation (he has a cottage in Ecchinswell). He sits as a crossbencher. In 2016 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society. ==Personal life== In 1985 he married Orna Ní Chionna, whom he met at McKinsey. She comes from Ireland, and was born c. 1956. She was Chair of the council of the Soil Association and a non-executive director of Northern Foods. Orna is a non-executive director of Royal Mail plc. ==References== ==External links== * FSA – Official Biography * Biography of Adair Turner at the former Pensions Commission * Announcement of his introduction at the House of Lords House of Lords minutes of proceedings, 12 October 2005 * Times profile 4 December 2005 * Times article 25 November 2005 * Guardian profile 25 November 2005 * Adair Turner Biography * Lord Turner to join Soros-funded think tank (BBC News  Business) * BBC Radio 4 Profile Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from Crawley Category:People from Ipswich Category:People educated at Glenalmond College Category:People educated at Hutchesons' Grammar School Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:British businesspeople Category:British business writers Category:McKinsey & Company people Turner of Ecchinswell Category:Crossbench life peers Category:Presidents of the Cambridge Union Category:Social Democratic Party (UK) politicians Category:Global Apollo Programme Category:Honorary Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Institute for New Economic Thinking ","title":"Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell"},{"id":"1437478","text":"is a Japanese actress, daughter of the poet Mizuno Akiyoshi.

Goodspeed called it a \\"religious romance\\"Edgar Johnson Goodspeed, \\"The Acts of Paul and Thecla\\" The Biblical World 17.3 (March 1901, pp. 185-190) p. 185.–of Paul the apostle's influence on a young virgin named Thecla. It is one of the writings of the New Testament apocrypha. == History of the text == It is attested no earlier than Tertullian, De baptismo 17:5 (c 190), who says that a presbyter from Asia wrote the History of Paul and Thecla, and was deposed after confessing that he wrote it. Tertullian inveighed against its use in the advocacy of a woman's right to preach and to baptize. Eugenia of Rome in the reign of Commodus (180-192) is reported in the Acts of her martyrdom to have taken Thecla as her model after reading the text, prior to its disapproval by Tertullian.\\"...there fell into her hands the History of the holy Apostle Paul and of the blessed Virgin Thekla, and as she read it in secret, day after day...\\" (\\"ACTS OF SAINT EUGENIA\\", chapter ii) Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare, The Apology and Acts of Apollonius and other monuments of early Christianity Swan, Sonnenschein & co., 1894, p.158 Jerome recounts the information from Tertullian,De Viris Illustribus. chapter 7: Luke and on account of his exactitude in reporting on chronology, some scholars regard the text a 1st-century creation.Ceresa-Gastaldo has shown that Jerome’s “care for the chronology is constant and fundamental”; from this he was able to deduce from the De viri illustribus and Chronicon that the “History of Paul” (incorporating the earlier Acts of Paul and Thecla) was originally published between AD 68-98: Studia Patristica 15 (1984) 55-68. Affirmed by A. Hilhorst [“Tertullian on the Acts of Paul”, p.159f], S. Reinach, Cultes, mythes et religions IV (Paris, 1912) 229-51 ('Thekla'), esp. 242, and Theodor Zahn, (Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen 1877, p.1307), cf. W. Rordorf, 'Tradition et composition dans les Actes de Thecle', Theologische Zeitschrift 41 (1985) 272-83, esp. 276, reprinted in his Liturgie, foi et vie des premiers Chretiens (Paris, 1986*) 457-68 Many surviving versions of the Acts of Paul and Thecla in Greek, and some in Coptic, as well as references to the work among Church fathers show that it was widely disseminated. In the Eastern Church, the wide circulation of the Acts of Paul and Thecla in Greek, Syriac, and Armenian is evidence of the veneration of Thecla of Iconium. There are also Latin, Coptic, and Ethiopic versions, sometimes differing widely from the Greek. \\"In the Ethiopic, with the omission of Thecla's admitted claim to preach and to baptize, half the point of the story is lost.\\"Goodspeed 1901:186 note. The discovery of a Coptic text of the Acts of Paul containing the Thecla narrativeIn a papyrus conserved at Heidelberg (Goodspeed 1901:185). suggests that the abrupt opening of the Acts of Paul and Thecla is due to its being an excerpt of that larger work. == Narrative of the text== The author sets this story during Paul the Apostle's First Missionary Journey, but this text is ideologically different from the New Testament portrayal of Paul. Here, Paul is described as travelling to Iconium (Acts 13:51), proclaiming \\"the word of God about abstinence and the resurrection\\". Paul is given a full physical description that may reflect oral tradition: in the Syriac text \\"he was a man of middling size, and his hair was scanty, and his legs were a little crooked, and his knees were projecting, and he had large eyesThe Armenian text adds \\"blue\\" according to Goodspeed 1901:186. and his eyebrows met, and his nose was somewhat long, and he was full of grace and mercy; at one time he seemed like a man, and at another time he seemed like an angel.\\" Paul gave his sermons in the house of Onesiphorus (cp. 2Tim 1:16) in a series of beatitudes, by which Thecla, a young noble virgin, listened to Paul's \\"discourse on virginity\\" from her window in an adjacent house. She listened, enraptured, without moving for days. Thecla's mother, Theocleia, and her fiancé, Thamyris, became concerned that Thecla would follow Paul's demand \\"that one must fear only one God and live in chastity\\", and they formed a mob to drag Paul to the governor, who imprisoned the apostle. Thecla bribed a guard to gain entrance to the prison, and sat at Paul's feet all night listening to his teaching and \\"kissing his bonds\\". When her family found her, both she and Paul were again brought before the governor. At her mother's request, Paul was sentenced to scourging and expulsion (cp. Acts 14:19, 2Tim 3:11), and Thecla to be killed by being burned at the stake, that \\"all the women who have been taught by this man may be afraid.\\" Stripped naked, Thecla was put on the fire, but she was saved by a miraculous storm which God sent to put out the flames. Reunited, Paul and Thecla then traveled to Pisidian Antioch (cp Acts 14:21)), where a nobleman named Alexander desired Thecla and offered Paul money for her. Paul claimed not to know her, and Alexander then attempted to take Thecla by force. Thecla fought him off, assaulting him in the process, to the amusement of the townspeople. Alexander dragged her before the governor for assaulting a nobleman and, despite the protests of the city's women, Thecla was sentenced to be eaten by wild beasts. To ensure that her virtue was intact at her death, Queen Tryphaena took her into protective custody overnight. Thecla was tied to a fierce lioness, and paraded through the city. She was then stripped and thrown to beasts, which were provided by Alexander. The women of the city again protested against the injustice. Thecla was protected from death, first by the lioness who fought off the other beasts, and then by a series of miracles until finally the women of the city and Queen Antonia Tryphaena intervened. The way in which Thecla was said to have baptized herself in the arena was quite strange and unique (the account of this is found in chapter 9 of the Acts of Paul and Thecla and also in the Acts of Thecla). While in the arena, she saw a vat of water that contained seals/sea-calves. Since she thought it might be her last chance to be baptized, she jumped into the vat and proclaimed that she was baptizing herself. A miracle occurred and all the seals/sea-calves were killed by lightning before they could eat her. Thecla returned to Paul unharmed. She later returned to Iconium to convert her mother. She went to live in Seleucia Cilicia. According to some versions of the Acts, she lived in a cave there for 72 years, becoming a healer. The Hellenistic physicians in the city lost their livelihood and solicited young men to rape Thecla at the age of 90. As they were about to take her, a new passage was opened in the cave and the stones closed behind her. She was able to go to Rome and lay beside Paul's tomb. ==See also== * Leucius Charinus * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 6 ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Translation, in Eliott, J.K.

The early access version was released for Microsoft Windows on Steam on October 12, 2016. A sequel, 30XX, is planned for release in 2021. == Gameplay == Inspired by Mega Man X, players must shoot or slash enemies and complete difficult platforming challenges to finish a stage. The twist is that these stages are generated randomly based on level segments, or \\"chunks\\", and also allow for both local and online co-op. Rather than giving you several lives, the game has permadeath, but is a \\"roguelite\\" in that you can use Soul Chips earned during the level to unlock new types of passive upgrades to buy, and gain upgrades for the next attempt of that particular run. During levels players can use bolts gained as currency to buy passive upgrades, or to gain back health or energy in vending machines. They can also find upgrades in treasure chests and other places. Upon beating a boss the player can choose to take their power as a reward, granting them a new special ability, or take a reward of bolts or a random passive upgrade instead. == Plot == The game follows Nina, an armored girl armed with a power blaster, and Ace, an armored boy who has an energy sword, in the aftermath of a robotic uprising. Traveling from their base on the Ark, a space station orbiting the Earth, they have been hired to clear dangerous locations that are infested with robots that have run amok. == Development == 20XX began to be developed after a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in the spring of 2014, when the game was called Echoes of Eridu. Following a successful Kickstarter, the game joined the Fire Hose Games accelerator program and appeared in the Indie Megabooth at Penny Arcade Expo 2015. The game was the developer Chris King's first commercial game, and its development was prompted by the belief that it was his last chance to do such a risky thing as game development without a family to support, as he was in his late 20s. The idea behind the game was due to his belief that Capcom had ceased to make enough Mega Man titles, and that he and other fans desired more of the same type of gameplay. The developer's main focus was on the game feel and getting it to play in a similar manner to Mega Man. The most difficult aspect in developing the game was debugging its netcode that allowed for online play. Chris believes that Steam's Early Access program was essential to the development of the game, and \\"couldn't imagine\\" releasing it without it. == Soundtrack == The game's soundtrack was composed by Brandon \\"Cityfires\\" Ellis and includes chiptune and synthesizer elements to make it resemble that of a Super NES game. == Reception == 20XX has been well received by both fans and the gaming press. Adam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun commented that the game \\"looks fantastic.\\" ==See also== *Mega Man X *Mighty No. 9 ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 video games Category:Action video games Category:Early access video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Roguelike video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Video games featuring female protagonists ","title":"20XX (video game)"},{"id":"1437491","text":"Windir (\\"Warrior\\" in English) was a black metal band from Sogndal, Norway. The band was formed in 1994 by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Terje \\"Valfar\\" Bakken, and released its debut album Sóknardalr in 1997. Windir combined black metal with Scandinavian folk music, folklore and mythology, and many of the band's lyrics are written in Sognamål. Windir produced four albums in their almost ten years of existence. The band broke up in March 2004 after frontman Valfar died of hypothermia after becoming caught in a blizzard on his way to his family's cabin in Norway. Following his death, the remaining band members went on to form a number of new bands including Vreid, Mistur, and Cor Scorpii. Most of the band's early albums featured lyrics written in frontman Valfar's native dialect, Sognamal. The band had an \\"intense affinity for traditional music and Norwegian texts, drawing much of its lyrical content from local sagas, using traditional folk tunes in its music, and singing in an archaic rural dialect.\\" With the coining of the term, the genre \\"Sognametal\\" as established by Windir has inspired many bands from the small region of Sogn og Fjordane, most of whom are ex-members of Windir or friends of them. These bands include: Vreid, Cor Scorpii, Mistur, Sigtyr and Feigd. ==Valfar's death== On January 14, 2004, Terje \\"Valfar\\" Bakken went to his family's cabin at Fagereggi, Norway, by foot.

[ \\"AllMusic ((( Windir > Biography )))\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved July 21, 2013. He was buried on January 27 at Stedje Church in Norway. In March 2004, Windir officially disbanded. A compilation album containing Windir outtakes and B-sides, Valfar, ein Windir, was released in 2004 as a tribute to Valfar. On September 3, 2004, in Oslo, Windir's remaining members performed their last concert to go back to their roots and keep base with what they thought was real.

It is structured as a security with an embedded credit default swap allowing the issuer to transfer a specific credit risk to credit investors. The issuer is not obligated to repay the debt if a specified event occurs. This eliminates a third-party insurance provider. It is a structured note issued by a special purpose company or trust, designed to offer investors par value at maturity unless the referenced entity defaults. In the case of default, the investors receive a recovery rate. The trust will also have entered into a default swap with a dealer. In case of default, the trust will pay the dealer par minus the recovery rate, in exchange for an annual fee which is passed on to the investors in the form of a higher yield on their note. The purpose of the arrangement is to pass the risk of specific default onto investors willing to bear that risk in return for the higher yield it makes available. The CLNs themselves are typically backed by very highly rated collateral, such as U.S. Treasury securities. The Italian dairy products giant, Parmalat, notoriously dressed up its books by creating a credit-linked note for itself, betting on its own credit worthiness. In Hong Kong and Singapore, credit-linked notes have been marketed as \\"minibonds\\" and sold to individual investors. After Lehman Brothers, the major issuer of minibond in Hong Kong and Singapore, filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, many retail investors of minibonds claim that banks and brokers mis-sold minibonds as low-risk products. Many banks accepted minibonds as collateral for loans and credit facilities.HK Hong Kong Gov't seeks to help Lehman minibond investors , International Business Times, 22 September 2008 == Explanation == A bank lends money to a company, XYZ, and at the time of loan issues credit-linked notes bought by investors. The interest rate on the notes is determined by the credit risk of the company XYZ. The funds the bank raises by issuing notes to investors are invested in bonds with low probability of default. If company XYZ is solvent, the bank is obligated to pay the notes in full. If company XYZ goes bankrupt, the note- holders/investors become the creditor of the company XYZ and receive the company XYZ loan. The bank in turn gets compensated by the returns on less- risky bond investments funded by issuing credit linked notes. == Emerging Market CLN == The emerging market credit linked note, also sometimes called a “clean,” are traded by buy side clients to gain access to local debt markets for several reasons. First is that a direct investment in the sovereign debt may not be legal due to domicile restrictions of the country. One instance would be the local government requiring the purchaser of debt to have a business office in the country. Another instance would be tax restrictions or tariffs in countries with NDF currencies. A fund in USD would have difficulty repatriating the currency if local restrictions or taxes made it undesirable. When this occurs, the sell side global bank purchases the debt and structures it into a derivative note then issued to the client or clients. The client then owns the issued security which derives its total return from the underlying instrument. A CDS, credit default swap, is embedded in the instrument. It can be thought of as a fully funded total return swap where the underlying asset total return is exchanged for a funding fee as well as the cost of the issued CLN. From a market risk perspective owning a CLN is almost identical to owning the local debt. However downstream, in the back office, difficulties can arise from failure to appropriately control the risks associated from the lack of data and compatibility of accounting platforms. The issue stems from the bespoke nature of the CLN in that it is priced in USD but the underlying asset is denominated in another currency. Secondly, the sell side may price the CLN based on the issued asset in USD. This in turn does not appropriately reflect the Yield to Maturity of the underlying asset as it approaches par value at maturity. Thirdly, the underlying asset may be inflation linked, or have periodic paydowns that compound the first and third issues mentioned before. == Notes == Under this structure, the coupon or price of the note is linked to the performance of a reference asset. It offers borrowers a hedge against credit risk, and gives investors a higher yield on the note for accepting exposure to a specified credit event. == See also == * Credit * Credit derivative * Credit derivative risks * Credit risk * Equity- linked note (ELN) Category:Corporate finance Category:Interest-bearing instruments Category:Credit risk ","title":"Credit-linked note"},{"id":"1437505","text":"Edward John Ivo Stourton (born 24 November 1957) is a BBC broadcaster and presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme Sunday, and a frequent contributor to the Today programme, where for ten years he was one of the main presenters. He is the author of six books, most recently Auntie's War: The BBC during the Second World War (2017). ==Early life and education== Stourton was born in the then British colony of Nigeria as his father was based there. He was educated at the now defunct Roman Catholic preparatory school Avisford in Walberton and at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire and was head boy in his final year at both establishments. While at Ampleforth he befriended future High Court judge Nicholas Mostyn, who was also the son of a Nigerian-based BAT executive. The duo won the national ESU Schools Mace debating prize in 1975. He read English literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, gaining a 2:1. He served as president of the Cambridge Union Society and editor of the student magazine Rampage. ==Broadcasting== He joined the staff of ITN in 1979 as a graduate trainee. While working there he was a founder member of Channel 4 News in 1982 working predominantly as a copywriter but also as a producer, duty home news editor and chief sub-editor. Stourton joined the BBC in 1988 as a Paris correspondent. He returned to ITN as a diplomatic editor in 1990. In 1993, he was back at the BBC as the presenter of BBC One O'Clock News for six years. He presented editions of Assignment, Correspondent, Panorama and Call Ed Stourton, a phone-in programme on Radio 4.

It was announced on 12 December 2008 that he would leave the programme in September 2009, to be replaced by Justin Webb.\\"Webb to replace Stourton on Today\\" BBC News, 12 December 2008 This announcement was greeted with widespread public dismay not least because Stourton found out about it from a journalist rather than his employers. Following a campaign by listeners, it was announced on 27 December 2008 that he was not being sacked. Instead, shortly after Justin Webb joined the Today Programme in August 2009, Stourton moved from presenting duties to reporting on foreign stories. Stourton presented Today for the last time on 11 September 2009.\\"BBC NEWS ; John and Ed's review\\" BBC News, 11 September 2009 Since leaving his presentation role on the Today programme, Stourton has joined the presenting teams of The World at One and The World This Weekend. On 27 December 2006 he appeared on the celebrity charitable edition of BBC One's Mastermind, chaired by his BBC Radio 4 Today co-presenter John Humphrys. When asked his name, Stourton replied: \\"John, why do you need to ask that?

Their songs were mostly in Spanish, English and French, often switching from one language to the other in the same song or in the middle of a sentence or title (e.g. \\"Puta's Fever\\"). They also had a hit song in Arabic.The song in Arabic is \\"Sidi H'bibi\\" (on Puta's Fever). Arabic words can also be heard on \\"Santa Maradona\\" (from the album Casa Babylon).

Reggae songs include \\"King of Fire\\" and \\"The Fool\\" (both on King of Bongo), \\"Machine Gun\\" and \\"Drives Me Crazy\\" (both on Casa Babylon). For raï influences, see notably the song \\"Sidi H'bibi\\" on Puta's Fever, sung in Arabic. They also made frequent use of samples of everyday sounds, electronica and experimental post-production techniques.See notably \\"Furious Festa\\" (on King of Bongo), \\"La Vida\\" (on Casa Babylon), and the use of a house beat on \\"Sueño De Solentíname\\" (Casa Babylon). Note for example the acceleration of the tape at the end of \\"Rock Island Line\\" (on Patchanka). This omnivorous approach, based on absorption and combination of a broad range of styles and sounds, was termed patchanka by the group (literally \\"patchwork\\", and the name of their first album). Taking Paris by storm in the winter of 1988-9, Mano Negra was touring the world by the following spring, achieving mainstream success in most of Europe and South America and recording a live album in Japan. However, their embrace by the English-speaking world remained limited. \\"Mala Vida\\" (1988, later covered by Gogol Bordello), \\"King Kong Five\\" (1990), \\"Out of Time Man\\" (1991) and \\"The Monkey\\" (1994) are among their most famous songs. The group earned a cult following through its eclectic sound and festive performances. After the release of their highly anticipated second album, Mano Negra famously declined to play the major Paris venues and toured only the cabarets of Pigalle instead (in accordance with the theme of the album, Puta's Fever i.e. \\"whore's fever\\"), sometimes ending their sets with illegal street performances. In 1992 they celebrated the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage with a Latin American tour completed on a cargo ship in which a street of Nantes had been recreated. (\\"[H]aving transported a street of Paris [sic] across the Atlantic is a marvel [una maravilla]\\", commented Gabriel García Márquez who visited the attraction.) It included a performance at the Earth Summit where they were joined on stage by Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. Their last and most exploratory album, Casa Babylon (1994), was released only after the band's split. Its reception in South America contributed to a renewal of Latino rock in the 1990s. Frontman Manu Chao went on to have a successful solo career, bringing some of Casa Babylon's songs to the stage with his group Radio Bemba Sound System. Mano Negra is now considered a cult band and still spreads their spirit to multiple acts around the world. ==Name== The band's name came to the group when reading a comic—the Condor series by Dominique Rousseau. \\"Mano Negro\\" was the name of a band of guerrillas in South America, and the band liked the black-hand symbol. ==Origins== In mid-1980s France, alternative rock bands such as Bérurier Noir, Noir Désir, and Los Carayos were leading the local scene. It is in this context that the musician Manu Chao, with the intention of recording some songs he had written that did not fit into the groups he had previously been a member of, decided to start a band with his brother, trumpeter Antoine Chao, and his cousin, drummer Santi Casariego. Needing more musicians, they called the group \\"Dirty District\\" and recorded the 1987 EP Takin' it up (Boucherie Productions). Also included in the initial combo was Jo Dahan on bass, from the legendary French punk band Les Wampas. After the recording, the group dissolved temporarily, with three members participating in other projects: Manu in Les Casse Pieds, Antoine with The Kingsnakes and Los Carayos with Santi. However, the following year, they recorded their first LP, Patchanka. The album contains songs previously written by Manu Chao and featuring Dirty District along with other musicians from Les Casse Pieds, Hot Pants and Los Carayos. Patchanka is an album that reflects the DIY ethos of the era, made on a budget and with imagination, and Manu Chao allowed the recording of several songs as unedited renditions: \\"Mala Vida\\", \\"Indios de Barcelona\\" and \\"Ronde de Nuit\\", among others. The laborious search for the \\"patchanka\\" sound did not stop there, as Manu continued to collaborate with other groups. All the while Patchanka was continuing to accumulate good reviews. Daniel Jamet (lead guitar), Jo Dahan (bass) and Philippe Teboul (drums), three members of Les Casse Pieds, decided to join the Mano Negra project and would later be joined by keyboardist Tomas Darnal. The group toured France and drew media attention, getting a record deal with major label Virgin Records France. This attracted criticism from the French alternative scene but otherwise allowed them to pay for their travels. ==Success== In 1989 the band started recording their second LP, Puta's Fever (\\"Slut's Fever\\"), the title being an ironic stab at the contempt with which other groups were treating them for signing with Virgin Records. Pierre Gauthe, trombone, joined as the eighth member of the group, and they went on tour to Latin America, choosing countries like Peru or Ecuador that were unaccustomed to hosting foreign rock bands and causing a sensation by performing free concerts in auditoriums and public places. Recording concluded on Puta's Fever, considered one of the best albums of the group, which mixes Tex-Mex (\\"Patchuko Hop\\"), Arabic songs (\\"Sidi H'Bibi\\"), flamenco, etc. Enriched with the Latin American experience and basking in the success of the new album in France and other European countries, in 1990 they began a world tour to more than fifteen countries, including Japan, Holland, Germany and the United States, where they opened for Iggy Pop. However, the U.S. tour was not a good experience, and the band decided not to pursue the Anglo market. During 1991, while the group continued to tour the European continent, its members began to show signs of disunity. However, they began recording in Cologne (Germany) what would become their third LP, King of Bongo. The album, which was not well received by critics, included more lyrics in English, fewer Latin rhythms and more rock and hardcore sounds. Among the English-language songs are \\"Mad Man's Dead\\", \\"Out of Time Man\\" and \\"Bring the Fire\\". Later, the group performed what would be its last concert in Paris with all its members in the parvis of la Défense, with attempts to cancel the show by the municipality. ==Worldwide tours== Later that same year, 1991, during one of its Japanese tours, they decided to record the only live album of the group, In the Hell of Patchinko, recorded during two concerts in the city of Kawasaki (Japan). The work captures, in essence, the energy of the live band, as Mano Negra was a band of performance, which owed much of its success to its eccentric performances and travel. Precisely in this year, they started the Cargo 92 project, embarking from the city of Nantes in the cargo ship Melquiades with the theater company Royal de Luxe in order to start a boat trip to South America subsidized by the French government. The tour, which lasted nearly five months and visited countries such as Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Cuba, Ecuador, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina and featured free performances in public places, witnessed the weakening of the group. After four months without a break in unfavorable economic conditions, the rebellious spirit of the group showed signs of unwillingness to continue. In July 1992, in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Mano Negra gave its last concert with all original members, preceded by an incident on the television program La TV ataca where the keyboard player broke a monitor. That same year, they released the compilation album Amerika Perdida (\\"Lost America\\"). Upon returning from South America, the tension between group members continued to grow and trumpeter Antoine left the band. The rest of the band, especially Manu, worked on what would become their next album, Casa Babylon (\\"Babylon House\\"), an album like King of Bongo, unrelated to their previous albums. At the same time, the group published a biographical book collection that includes a picture disc Bande Originale Du Livre with new songs, some included later in the album Casa Babylon. During the recording sessions, Jo Dahan and Daniel Jamet also left the group, allowing in new members who were not welcomed by some former members. Among them were Fidel Nadal, Argentine vocalist from Todos Tus Muertos, and Gambeat, the bass player from Manu's new band French Lovers. The result of the recordings was the only concept album from the group; piece by piece, it becomes a party of Latin rhythms mixed with shreds of rock and hardcore. The group as such did not perform tracks from Casa Babylon live although several of its members gave performances in Spain under different names, such as \\"Larchuma FC\\" or \\"Radio Bemba\\", and collaborated with other groups, especially the Basque alternative rock band Negu Gorriak. ==End== In late 1993, several members of the group decided to make a trip by train through Colombia during which they were joined by members of the groups Royal de Lux and French Lovers. After two weeks of travel, and after the last of their two concerts in Santa Marta and Aracataca, all other members of the group except Manu and Thomas decided to return to Paris. It was the end of an era, which Ramon Chao described in the book The Train of Ice and Fire: Mano Negra in Colombia. However, in 1994 the details were finalized for the start of the album Casa Babylon, which wasn't released in either the United States or Britain. The music video of the song \\"Señor Matanza\\" (Mr. Slaughter) brought more publicity to the band in Latin America, where their popularity had been on the rise. The band was already dissolved, a fact ignored by many of its admirers. Meanwhile, among the old members there were two possibilities for the future of Mano Negra: continuity of the band with some freedom for other participants to enter while leaving the door open for the original members to return or, alternately, the group could cease to exist under the Mano Negra name. This second approach was chosen. In 1995, Manu Chao and other members of the band wanted to continue to offer concerts in Madrid but, due to the restriction on the use of the former name of the group, had to do so as \\"Radio Bemba\\"--a project that was also ultimately dissolved. In 1998, the compilation album Best of Mano Negra was released, including 22 hits and two previously unreleased tracks. The album was well received, although it was criticized for the fact that it was released just as the LP Clandestino, Manu Chao's solo album, was having some success. In 2005, there was a planned release of a double DVD of the group with six hours of concerts, documentaries, and rare images of the band's history. Manu Chao was not involved in the production but six other members--Jo, Tom, Phillipe, Daniel, Antoine and Pierre--offered interviews to promote the work. In a presentation to France Inter's program ', they performed three numbers: \\"Jamie Jamie\\", \\"Sidi H'Bibi\\" and a version of \\"Jesus Reviens\\" (Jesus Return) that they titled \\"Manu Reviens\\", calling on the former leader of the group to return. In December 2005, the same members participated in a festival as \\"Mano Negra Sound System\\", playing the song \\"Sidi H'Bibi\\" and others, but more like DJs, as they contributed only brass and keyboards. ==Manu Chao solo== After the band split, Manu Chao continued his solo career, always committed with political and social issues, immigration, ghettos, and injustice, sometimes releasing albums completely in Spanish, and others in French. His Clandestino album aimed to feature groups from diverse backgrounds, such as Mexico's Tijuana No!, Brazil's Skank, and Argentinia's Todos Tus Muertos. The goal was to replicate the sound of street music and bar scenes from a variety of cultures. The album was a major success in Latin America; though not an instant success in Europe, it eventually earned the Best World Music Album award in 1999's Victoires de la Musique awards and sold in excess of 5 million copies worldwide. This success was followed by Próxima Estación: Esperanza (\\"Next station: Hope\\"), released in 2001, with similar Latin, Caribbean, and ska sounds. Two years later, Chao returned to his French roots, with the French-only album Sibérie m'était contée (\\"All About Siberia\\"). Though Chao is quite well known in Europe and Latin America, he has not had the same success in the English-speaking world. Tours in the United States with Mano Negra were not as successful as elsewhere and Chao seems inclined to focus his efforts in the places where his musical style finds its roots. Though his live performances in the U.S. are infrequent, Chao played a handful of dates there in 2006, including a headline show at Lollapalooza 2006 in Chicago, IL, \\"Celebrate Brooklyn\\" in 2007, and at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland to a sellout crowd on 23 June 2007. He was one of the headliners at the 2008 Austin City Limits Music Festival (Texas) and the Outside Lands Music Festival in Golden Gate Park (San Francisco, CA). In 2011 he took his \\"La Ventura\\" tour to several cities around the United States. ==Band members== *Manu Chao (Oscar Tramor) – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1987–1995) *Antoine Chao (Tonio Del Borño) – trumpets, vocals (1987–1992) *Santiago Casariego (Santi El Águila) – drums, vocals (1987–1993) *Philippe Teboul (Garbancito) – percussion, vocals (1989–1993) *Daniel Jamet (Roger Cageot) – lead guitar, vocals (1989–1992) *Joseph Dahan (Jo) – bass, vocals (1989–1993) *Thomas Darnal (Helmut Krumar) – keyboards, vocals (1989–1995) *Pierre Gauthé (Krøpöl 1er) – trombone, vocals (1989–1993) ==Discography== ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:24em;\\" Single ! colspan=\\"4\\" Peak positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"35\\" FRA ! width=\\"35\\" NED ! width=\\"35\\" BEL (FLA) ! width=\\"35\\" UK -  rowspan=\\"1\\"1987 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Takin' It Up\\"  —  —  —  —  align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Patchanka -  rowspan=\\"1\\"1988 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Mala Vida\\"  —  —  —  — -  rowspan=\\"4\\"1990 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"King Kong Five\\"  —  8  11  95  align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"5\\" Puta's Fever - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Patchanka\\"  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Rock 'N' Roll Band\\"  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Pas assez de toi\\"  32  —  —  — -  rowspan=\\"4\\"1991 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Sidi h'bibi\\"  47  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"King Of Bongo\\"  38  —  —  —  align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"5\\" King Of Bongo - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Madame Oscar\\"  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Out Of Time Man\\"  —  —  —  — -  rowspan=\\"1\\"1992 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Don't Want You No More\\"  —  —  —  — -  rowspan=\\"1\\"1993 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Mad Man's Dead\\"  —  —  —  — -  rowspan=\\"2\\"1994 ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Señor Matanza\\"  —  —  —  —  align=\\"left\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Casa Babylon - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Santa Maradona (Larchuma Football Club)\\"  42  —  —  — -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"16\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt\\" \\"—\\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released. } ===Studio albums=== *1988: Patchanka *1989: Puta's Fever *1991: King of Bongo *1994: Casa Babylon ===Live recordings=== *1992: In the Hell of Patchinko ===Compilations=== *1991: Amerika Perdida (Lost America) *1998: Best of *2004: L'Essentiel (Mano Negra album) (The Essential) ===Other releases=== *1994: Bande Originale Du Livre (picture disc) *2001: Mano Negra Illegal (tribute album) ==Video== ===DVD=== *2005: Out of Time (DVD) ==Media== ===Television=== *Les Nuls L'émission, canal +, France 1990 *Live pinkpop, holland 1990 *Live Lyon, France 1991 ==Further reading== *Chao, Ramón.

Kiš was influenced by Bruno Schulz, Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Boris Pilnyak, Ivo Andrić and Miroslav KrležaRazgovor sa Danilom Kišom. youtube.com among other authors. His best known works include Hourglass, A Tomb for Boris Davidovich and The Encyclopedia of the Dead. ==Life and work== Danilo Kiš on a 2010 Montenegro stamp ===Early life=== Kiš was born in Subotica, Danube Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now Serbia). Kiš was the son of Eduard Kiš (), a Hungarian- speaking Jewish railway inspector and Milica (née Dragićević), a Serbian Orthodox Christian from Cetinje. His father was born in Austria-Hungary with the surname Kohn, but changed it to Kiš as part of Magyarization, a widely implemented practice at the time. Kiš's parents met in 1930 in Subotica and married the following year. Milica gave birth to a daughter, Danica, in Zagreb in 1932 before the family relocated to Subotica. Kiš's father was an unsteady and often absent figure in Danilo's childhood. Eduard Kiš spent time in a psychiatric hospital in Belgrade in 1934 and again in 1939. Kiš visited his father in the hospital during one of his later stays. This visit, in which, Kiš recalled his father asking his mother for a pair of scissors with which to commit suicide, made a strong impression on young Danilo. For many years, Kiš believed that his father's psychological troubles stemmed from alcoholism. Only in the 1970s did Kiš learn that his father had suffered from anxiety neurosis. Between stays in the hospital, Eduard Kiš edited the 1938 edition of the Yugoslav National and International Travel Guide. Young Danilo saw his father as a traveler and a writer. Eduard Scham, the eccentric father of the protagonist of Early Sorrows, Garden, Ashes, and Hourglass is largely based on Kiš's own father. ===World War II=== Kiš's parents were concerned with the rising tide of anti-Semitism all around in Europe in the late 1930s. In 1939, they oversaw three-year-old Danilo's baptism into the Eastern Orthodox Church in Novi Sad, where the Kiš family resided at the time. Kiš later acknowledged that this action likely saved his life, since as the son of a Jewish convert to Christianity, Danilo would probably have been subject to persecution without definitive proof of his Christian faith. In April 1941, Hungarian troops, in alliance with Nazi Germany, invaded the northern Yugoslavian province of Vojvodina. After Hungary declared war on the Allied powers in 1941, territory was annexed and officials began to persecute Jews in the region. On January 20, 1942, gendarmes and troops invaded Novi Sad, and two days later, gendarmes massacred thousands of Jews in their homes and around the city. Eduard Kiš was among a large group of Jews rounded up and taken by the gendarmes to the banks of the frozen Danube to be shot. Eduard managed to survive, only because the hole in the ice where the gendarmes were dumping the bodies of the dead became so clogged with bodies that the commanders called for the officers to stop the killing. Kiš later described the massacre as the start of his \\"conscious life\\". Following the massacre, Eduard relocated his family to Kerkabarabás, a town in south-west Hungary. Danilo attended primary school in Kerkabarabás. Through 1944, Hungarian Jews were largely safe, as compared to Jews in other Axis-occupied countries since Hungarian officials were reluctant to hand over Jews to the Nazis. However, in mid 1944 authorities began to deport Jews en masse to concentration camps. Eduard Kiš was sent to a ghetto in Zalaegerszeg in April or May 1944, then was deported to Auschwitz on July 5. Eduard, along with many of his relatives, died in Auschwitz. Danilo, Danica, and Milica, perhaps owing to Danilo and Danica's baptism certificates, were saved from deportation. Kiš's father's death had a massive impact on his work. Kiš crafted his own father into Eduard Scham, the father of the protagonist of Early Sorrows, Garden, Ashes, and Hourglass. Kiš described his father as a \\"mythical figure,\\" and would continually claim that his father had not died in Auschwitz but had \\"disappeared.\\" ===Post-war life=== After the end of the war, the family moved to Cetinje, Yugoslavia, where Kiš graduated from high school in 1954. Kiš studied literature at the University of Belgrade. Kiš was an excellent student, receiving praise from students and faculty members alike. He graduated in 1958 as the first student at the University of Belgrade to be awarded a degree in comparative literature. After graduating, Kiš stayed on for two years of postgraduate research. ===Career=== While doing research at the University of Belgrade, Kiš was a prominent writer for Vidici magazine, where he worked until 1960. In 1962 he published his first two novels, Mansarda (translated as The Garret) and Psalm 44. He then took up a position as a lector at the University of Strasbourg. He held the position until 1973. In that period, he translated several French books into Serbo-Croatian. He also wrote and published Garden, Ashes (1965), Early Sorrows (1969), and Hourglass (1972). For his novel Peščanik (Hourglass), Kiš received the prestigious NIN Award, but returned it a few years later due to a political dispute. Plagiarism controversy In 1976, A Tomb for Boris Davidovich was published. Kiš drew inspiration for the novel from his time as a lecturer at the University of Bordeaux. Kiš returned to Belgrade that year only to be hit by claims that he plagiarized portions of the novel from any number of authors. Critics also attacked the novel for its alleged Marxist themes. Kiš responded to the scandal by writing The Anatomy Lesson. In the book, he accused his critics of parroting nationalist opinions and of being anti-literary. Several of the people that Kiš criticized in The Anatomy Lesson sought retribution following its publication. In 1981, Dragan Jeremić, a professor of aesthetics at the University of Belgrade and opponent of Kiš, published Narcissus without a Face in which he reasserted his claim that Kiš had plagiarized A Tomb for Boris Davidovich. Dragoljub Golubović, the journalist who published the first story accusing Kiš of plagiarism, sued Kiš for defamation. The case was eventually dismissed in March 1979, but not after it drew substantial attention from the public. Move to Paris Rattled by the plagiarism controversy and subsequent defamation lawsuit, Kiš left Belgrade for Paris in the summer of 1979. In 1983 he published The Encyclopedia of the Dead. During this period in his life, Kiš achieved greater global recognition as his works were translated into several languages. ===Death and Funeral=== After feeling weak for several months, Kiš was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer in September 1989. He died a month later, on October 15, 1989. Kiš was 54 at the time of his death, the same age that his father had been when he was sent to Auschwitz. As per his request, he was buried in Belgrade with the Serbian Orthodox Church rite. ===Personal life=== Kiš was married to Mirjana Miočinović from 1962 to 1981. At the time of his death, he was living with Pascale Delpech, his former student from the University of Bordeaux. Kiš was a close friend of writer Susan Sontag. After his death, Sontag edited and published Homo Poeticus, a compilation of Kiš's essays and interviews. ==Adaptations and translations of Kiš's work== A film based on Peščanik (Fövenyóra), directed by Hungarian director Szabolcs Tolnai, was finished in 2008. In May 1989, with his friend, director Aleksandar Mandić, Kiš made the four-episode TV series Goli Život about the lives of two Jewish women. The shooting took place in Israel. The program was broadcast after his death, in the spring of 1990, and was his last work. Kiš's work was translated into English only in a piecemeal fashion, and many of his important books weren't available in English until the 2010s, when Dalkey Archive began releasing a selection of titles, including A Tomb for Boris Davidovich and Garden, Ashes; in 2012, Dalkey released The Attic, Psalm 44, and the posthumous collection of stories The Lute and the Scars, capably translated by John K. Cox. These publications completed the process of \\"the Englishing of Kiš's fiction\\", allowing the possibility of what Pete Mitchell of Booktrust called a resurrection of Kiš. ==Style and themes== Kiš was influenced especially by Jorge Luis Borges: he had been accused of plagiarizing Borges (and James Joyce) in A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, which prompted a \\"scathing response\\" in The Anatomy Lesson (1978), and the influence of Borges is recognized in The Encyclopedia of the Dead. From Bruno Schulz, the Polish writer and prose stylist, Kiš picked up \\"mythic elements\\" for The Encyclopedia of the Dead, and he reportedly told John Updike that \\"Schulz is my God\\". Branko Gorjup sees two distinct periods in Kiš's career as a novelist. The first, which includes Psalm 44, Garden, Ashes, and Early Sorrows, is marked by realism: Kiš creates characters whose psychology \\"reflect[s] the external world of the writer's memories, dreams, and nightmares, or his experiences of the time and space in which he lives\\". The worlds he constructed in his narratives, while he distanced himself from pure mimesis, were still constructed to be believable. The separation from mimesis he sought to achieve by a kind of deception through language, a process intended to instill \\"'doubts' and 'trepidations' associated with a child's growing pains and early sorrows. The success of this 'deception' depended upon the effect of 'recognition' on the part of the reader\\". The point, for Kiš, was to make the reader accept \\"the illusion of a created reality\\". In those early novels, Kiš still employed traditional narrators and his plots unfolded chronologically, but in later novels, beginning with Hourglass (the third volume of the \\"Family Cycle\\", after Garden, Ashes and Early Sorrows), his narrative techniques changed considerably and traditional plotlines were no longer followed. The role of the narrator was strongly reduced, and perspective and plot were fragmented: in Hourglass, which in Eduard Scham portrayed a father figure resembling the author's, \\"at least four different Schams with four separate personalities\\" were presented, each based on documentary evidence. This focus on the manipulation and selection of supposed documentary evidence is a hallmark of Kiš's later period, and underlies the method of A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, according to Branko Gorjup: > First, most of the plots in the work are derived or borrowed from already- > existing sources of varied literary significance, some easily > recognizable—for example, those extracted from Roy Medvedev and Karl > Steiner—while others are more obscure. Second, Kiš employs the technique of > textual transposition, whereby entire sections or series of fragments, often > in their unaltered state, are taken from other texts and freely integrated > into the fabric of his work. This documentary style places Kiš's later work in what he himself called a post-Borges period, but unlike Borges the documentation comes from \\"historically and politically relevant material\\", which in A Tomb for Boris Davidovich is used to denounce Stalinism. Unlike Borges, Kiš is not interested in metaphysics, but in \\"more ordinary phenomena\\"; in the title story of The Encyclopedia of the Dead, this means building an encyclopedia \\"containing the biography of every ordinary life lived since 1789\\". ==Bibliography== * Mansarda: satirična poema, 1962 (novel); translated as The Attic by John K.

The project is a multi-year endeavor aimed at accelerating the pace of reform in post-1989 democracies and advancing the date for the integration of these democracies into the institutions of the Euro-Atlantic. ==Biography== Bruce P. Jackson is son of William Harding Jackson, United States National Security Adviser under Eisenhower. From 1979 to 1990, Jackson served in the United States Army as a Military Intelligence Officer. From 1986 to 1990, he served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in a variety of policy positions pertaining to nuclear forces and arms control. Upon leaving the Department of Defense in 1990, Jackson joined Lehman Brothers, an investment bank in New York, where he was a strategist in the firm's proprietary trading operations. Between 1993 and 2002, Jackson was Vice President for Strategy and Planning at Lockheed Martin Corporation. During 1995 and 1996, Jackson was National Co-Chairman of the Dole for President Finance Committee. In 1996, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention where he served on the Platform Committee and the Platform's subcommittee for National Security and Foreign Policy. During the 2000 Presidential Campaign, he was a delegate committed to Governor Bush and chaired the Foreign Policy Subcommittee of the Republican Platform Committee. From 1995 until 2003, he was the President of the US Committee on NATO, a non-profit corporation formed in 1996 to promote the expansion of NATO and the strengthening of ties between the United States and Europe. In 2004, Jackson became a member of the International Commission on the Balkans and the Board of Directors of the We Remember Foundation, which is working to bring the officials of the Government of Belarus to justice for the disappearances of political opposition leaders and journalists. He has been recognized for his work on democratic change and European integration by the Governments of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Most recently, Jackson's work has focused on accelerating the integration of the Western Balkan countries and Turkey into the European Union and NATO and on building closer relationship between European institutions and the democracies within the European Union's Eastern Partnership, particularly Ukraine. He has written extensively about the engagement of Russia and Eastern European democracies by the European Union and the United States, on the new geo-economics of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region, and on the energy security of Europe. == Professional Positions == * President, Project on Transitional Democracies 2002–Present * Served as the Vice President for Strategy and Planning at Lockheed Martin, 1993–2002. * Worked for Lehman Brothers, as a strategist for proprietary trading operations, 1990–1993. * Served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, holding a variety of positions pertaining to nuclear weapons and arms control, 1986–1990. * Served in the US Army as a Military Intelligence Officer, 1979–1990. ==Political Roles== * McCain for President 2008, Foreign Policy advisory team * 2000 Republican National Convention: Chair of Platform Subcommittee for Foreign Policy, presidential campaign (George W.

His judicial challenge of the football transfer rules led to the Bosman ruling in 1995. This landmark judgement, which was handed down by the European Court of Justice, completely changed the way footballers are employed, allowing professional players in the European Union (except for Malta where the illegal parameter system at the end of contract is still legal) to move freely to another club at the end of their contract with their present team. ==Career and trial== Prior to the landmark trial for which he became known, Bosman played for Belgian first division club Standard de Liège and RFC Liège, and also won 20 caps for Belgium at youth level, even captaining the under-21 side for a time. He joined the former club in 1983, before moving to RFC Liège in 1988. When his contract with the latter club had expired two years later, he attempted to join French club Dunkerque in 1990, at the age of 25; however, Liège valued him at a fee of approximately £500,000, and insisted that the French club pay in full up front. When they refused, Liège refused to agree to the transfer, and cut Bosman's wages by 75% to £500 per month. This led Bosman to challenge the system legally and bring his case to court; he sued Liège, the Belgian FA, and UEFA, arguing that the rules set out by UEFA, which prevented him from leaving his club even though his contract had expired, amounted to a breach of his rights established in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which allowed freedom of movement within the European Community, now the European Union. As a result, his club suspended him. While the trial was ongoing Bosman played briefly in the French lower leagues for second division club Saint-Quentin, and on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion. On 15 December 1995, the European Court of Justice ruled that players should be free to move when their contracts had expired, and that EU clubs could hire any number of European Union players. ==After the ruling== Despite the legal victory, Bosman faced significant financial and personal difficulties following the landmark trial. In a 2011 interview, he claimed that the compensation he earned from FIFPro and the courts were largely spent on legal fees, which ultimately left him bankrupt; furthermore, his marriage also ended during his legal battles and trial. Some of his money was also lost due to a bad investment in a special T-shirt line. Bosman hoped that the players who benefited from the Bosman ruling would support him by buying one of his \\"Who's the Boz\\" T-shirts. He sold only one, to the son of his lawyer. He also hoped to play a testimonial match, which eventually fell through, however, although he ultimately played a match against Lille in front of only approximately 2,000 spectators. In order to pay his taxes, he was forced to sell his second house and his Porsche Carrera. He struggled to find work after the ruling, and ended up living on welfare; as a result of his financial difficulties and his claimed ostracism by the world of football, Bosman fell into depression and also struggled with alcoholism. In April 2013 Bosman was given a one-year suspended prison sentence following an assault on both his girlfriend at the time and her 15-year old daughter, allegedly over his then girlfriend's refusal to give him an alcoholic drink in 2011; it was later reduced to community service on appeal. As of 2015, Bosman was unemployed and relying on handouts from FIFPro. ==Personal life== Bosman has two sons, the elder Martin, and the younger Samuel. ==References== ==External links== * FamousBelgians.net: Jean-Marc Bosman * Uefa.com abridged interview: 2005 Interview with Jean-Marc Bosman * BosmanRuling.co.uk Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian footballers Category:Standard Liège players Category:RFC Liège players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:Belgian prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Belgium Category:Olympique Saint-Quentin players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Jean-Marc Bosman"},{"id":"1437556","text":"Oris regulator dive watch with small seconds Oris SA is a Swiss luxury manufacturer of mechanical watches. The company was founded in 1904 and is based in Hölstein in the canton of Basel-Landschaft. ==History== === Genesis and early growth === Oris was founded by Paul Cattin and Georges Christian in the Swiss town of Hölstein. They bought the recently closed Lohner & Co watch factory, and on June 1, 1904 the two men entered into a contract with the local mayor. They named their new watch company Oris after a nearby brook, and they began the industrial manufacture of pocket watches. In its founding year, Oris employed 67 people. In 1906, the firm opened an assembly plant and second factory in the nearby town of Holderbank. Another factory followed in Como in 1908. By 1911, Oris had become the largest employer in Hölstein, with over 300 workers. To entice more watchmakers, it built houses and apartments for its staff, and it expanded so that by 1929 it had additional factories in Courgenay (1916), Herbetswil (1925) and Ziefen (1925). === The first Oris wristwatches === With the opening of the Ziefen factory and the electroplating plant in Herbetswil, Oris expanded its product range. The company began to fit bracelet buckles to its pocket watches, thereby transforming them into fully- fledged wristwatches. In 1927, company co-founder Georges Christian died and Jacques-David LeCoultre became President of the Board of Directors. Jacques- David LeCoultre was Antoine LeCoultre’s grandson and the man who merged with Edmond Jaeger to form Jaeger-LeCoultre in 1937. Following the death of Georges Christian a year earlier, Oscar Herzog, Christian's brother-in-law, took over as General Manager in 1928, a position he held for 43 years. === First alarm clocks === In 1936, Oris opened its own dial factory in Biel/Bienne. By that time, the company produced almost every element of its watch and clock products in-house. Oris introduced its signature pilot’s watch in 1938, the so-called Big Crown. The collection takes its name from the watch’s oversized crown, employed as an aid to pilots who adjust their watches while wearing leather gloves. Variations on this watch are still produced today.249x249pxDuring the Second World War, Oris’s distribution network beyond Switzerland was reduced significantly. To keep business alive, the company started manufacturing alarm clocks. With the end of the war, the company expanded again. === The Swiss Watch Statute === On March 12, 1934, the Swiss government introduced the so-called ‘Watch Statute’. This peculiar law designed to protect and regulate the industry prevented watch companies from introducing new technologies without permission. For Oris, the statute proved to be an obstacle; because until that point, Oris had been using pin-lever escapement (Roskopf escapement) movements, which were claimed to be less accurate than the lever escapements used by some of Oris’s competitors, who had adopted such technology before the law was passed.Oris Meistertaucher displaying illumination Oris ProDiver ChronographDespite successes with this technology, Oris took action against the Watch Statute. In 1956 the company’s General Manager Oscar Herzog hired a young lawyer by the name of Dr Rolf Portmann who spent his first 10 years at the company campaigning to reverse the Watch Statute. Subsequently, the Watch Statute was gradually liberalised until it was abolished in 1971. === The Quartz Crisis === By the end of the 1960s, 44 per cent of all watches sold worldwide originated in Switzerland. Oris employed 800 people across a network of factories in Hölstein and beyond, and produced 1.2 million watches and clocks a year, making it one of the 10 largest watch companies in the world. The company developed its own tools and machinery, and even ran an apprenticeship scheme, training 40 engineers and watchmakers every year. But then came the turning point. In the 1970s and early 1980s, quartz watches from Asia gained massive market share. The so- called ‘Quartz Crisis’ meant the end for around 900 watch companies in Switzerland and unemployment for two thirds of watch industry employees. Swiss manufacturers’ market share fell to 13 per cent worldwide. In 1970, Oris gave up its independence and became part of Allgemeine Schweizer Uhrenindustrie AG (ASUAG), the predecessor of the Swatch Group. Oris began to manufacture quartz watches, too. However, this did not restore success. In the early 1980s, Oris employed only a few dozen people. In 1981, the production of its own movements was abandoned. === New beginnings === Like many other Swiss watch manufacturers in the early 1980s, Oris was on the verge of closure. Managing Director Dr Rolf Portmann – who was instrumental in the reversal of the Watch Statute – and Head of Marketing Ulrich W. Herzog took over the remainder of the company in 1982 as part of a management buyout. Soon after, the newly formed and independent Oris SA elected to abandon quartz and produce solely mechanical timepieces in the mid-price segment. Oris made its last quartz watch in the early 1990s. === Recent developments === Since the turn of the millennium, the company has concentrated on the worlds of Diving, Culture, Aviation and Motor Sports. Since 2002, the Red Rotor has served as Oris's registered trademark and distinguishing feature. In 2004, the Quick Lock Crown system was developed, which only requires a single clockwise turn of 120 degrees to secure it in place. In 2009, Oris introduced the Rotation Safety System, a device that locks the uni-directional rotating bezel of a diving watch into place, preventing accidental adjustment under water. Oris patented the Oris Aquis Depth Gauge, its first mechanical depth gauge, in 2013. It allows water into a channel via a small hole at 12 o’clock. Water enters the hole under pressure, creating a watermark that corresponds to a depth gauge. In 2014, Oris celebrated 110 years of watchmaking with its first in-house- developed calibre for 35 years. Calibre 110 was a hand-wound movement that featured a 10-day power reserve and a patented non-linear power reserve indicator. == Notable models == * Big Crown (1938) * 8-Day-Clock (1949) * Chronoris (1970) * Oris Worldtimer (1997) == See also == * Quartz Crisis ==References== ==External links== * Category:Swiss watch brands Category:Watch brands Category:Watch manufacturing companies of Switzerland Category:Luxury brands Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1904 Category:Basel- Landschaft ","title":"Oris SA"},{"id":"1437565","text":"\\"The Tyger\\" is a poem by the English poet William Blake, published in 1794 as part of his Songs of Experience collection. It is one of Blake's most reinterpreted and arranged works.Whitson and Whittaker 63–71. Literary critic Alfred Kazin calls it \\"the most famous of his poems\\",Kazin, 41–43. and The Cambridge Companion to William Blake says it is \\"the most anthologized poem in English\\".Eaves, p. 207. ==Background== The Songs of Experience was published in 1794 as a follow up to Blake's 1789 Songs of Innocence.Gilchrist 1907 p. 118 The two books were published together under the merged title Songs of Innocence and of Experience, showing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul: the author and printer, W. Blake featuring 54 plates. The illustrations are arranged differently in some copies, while a number of poems were moved from Songs of Innocence to Songs of Experience. Blake continued to print the work throughout his life.Davis 1977 p. 55 Of the copies of the original collection, only 28 published during his life are known to exist, with an additional 16 published posthumously.Damon 1988 p. 378 Only five of the poems from Songs of Experience appeared individually before 1839.Bentley 2003 p. 148 ==Poem== ==Structure== The first and last stanzas are identical except the word \\"could\\" becomes \\"dare\\" in the second iteration. Kazin says to begin to wonder about the tiger, and its nature, can only lead to a daring to wonder about it. Blake achieves great power through the use of alliteration (\\"frame\\" and \\"fearful\\") combined with imagery (burning, fire, eyes), and he structures the poem to ring with incessant repetitive questioning, demanding of the creature, \\"Who made thee?\\" In the third stanza the focus moves from the tiger, the creation, to the creator – of whom Blake wonders \\"What dread hand? & what dread feet?\\". \\"The Tyger\\" is six stanzas in length, each stanza four lines long. Much of the poem follows the metrical pattern of its first line and can be scanned as trochaic tetrameter catalectic. A number of lines, however, such as line four in the first stanza, fall into iambic tetrameter. \\"The Tyger\\" lacks narrative movement. The first stanza opens the central question, \\"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\" Here the direct address to the creature becomes most obvious, but certainly, \\"the Tyger\\" cannot provide the lyrical \\"I\\" with a satisfactory answer, so the contemplation continues. The second stanza questions \\"the Tyger\\" about where he was created; the third about how the creator formed him; the fourth about what tools were used. In the fifth stanza, Blake wonders how the creator reacted to \\"the Tyger\\", and who created the creature. Finally, the sixth restates the central question while raising the stakes; rather than merely question who or what \\"could\\" create the Tyger, the speaker wonders: who dares. ==Themes and critical analysis== \\"The Tyger\\" is the sister poem to \\"The Lamb\\" (from \\"Songs of Innocence\\"), a reflection of similar ideas from a different perspective (Blake's concept of \\"contraries\\"), with \\"The Lamb\\" bringing attention to innocence. \\"The Tyger\\" presents a duality between aesthetic beauty and primal ferocity, and Blake believes that to see one, the hand that created \\"The Lamb\\", one must also see the other, the hand that created \\"The Tyger”: \\"Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\\" The \\"Songs of Experience\\" were written as a contrary to the \\"Songs of Innocence\\" – a central tenet in Blake's philosophy, and central theme in his work. The struggle of humanity is based on the concept of the contrary nature of things, Blake believed, and thus, to achieve truth one must see the contraries in innocence and experience. Experience is not the face of evil but rather another facet of that which created us. Kazin says of Blake, \\"Never is he more heretical than ... where he glories in the hammer and fire out of which are struck ... the Tyger\\". Rather than believing in war between good and evil or heaven and hell, Blake thought each man must first see and then resolve the contraries of existence and life. In \\"The Tyger\\" he presents a poem of \\"triumphant human awareness\\" and \\"a hymn to pure being\\", according to Kazin. ==Musical versions== Blake's original tunes for his poems have been lost in time, but many artists have tried to create their own versions of the tunes. *Rebecca Clarke – \\"The Tiger\\" (1929–33) * Benjamin Britten, in his song cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake (1965) *Marianne Faithfull, in her song \\"Eye Communication\\" (1981) from the Dangerous Acquaintances album. *Howard Frazin, in his song \\"The Tiger\\" for soprano and piano (2008), later expanded into an overture for orchestra, \\"In the Forests of the Night\\" (2009) commissioned by the Boston Classical Orchestra. * Duran Duran – \\"Tiger Tiger\\" (1983) * Greg Brown, on the album \\"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\\" (1986) * John Tavener – \\"The Tyger\\" (1987) * Tangerine Dream – the album Tyger (1987) * Jah Wobble – \\"Tyger Tyger\\" (1996) * Kenneth Fuchs – Songs of Innocence and of Experience: Four Poems by William Blake for Baritone, Flute, Oboe, Cello, and Harp (completed 2006) * Herbst in Peking – \\"The Tyger and The Fly\\" (2014) * Qntal – \\"Tyger\\" (2014) * Mephisto Walz – \\"The Tyger\\" Bob Dylan also references Blake’s poem in “Roll on John” (2012). ==See also== *Fearful Symmetry (disambiguation) *Quasar, Quasar, Burning Bright *Eye rhyme ==References== ==Sources== * Bentley, G.

Lyons & Co tea shops and cafés in London. Beginning in the late 19th century, a J. Lyons waitress was called a \\"Gladys\\". From 1926, because the waitresses nipped (moved quickly) around the tea shops, the term \\"Nippy\\" came into use. Nippies wore a distinctive maid-like uniform with a matching hat. ==Image and reality== By the 1920s it was already long established in the advertising world that attractive females could sell products, and the tea business of J. Lyons & Co was no exception. Nippies appeared in all manner of advertising, on product packages, and on promotional items. The Nippy soon became a national icon. Unlike other endorsements of the day, which often took the form of popular celebrities or cartoon characters, a Nippy was accessible and close to home. A Nippy was someone who could be seen and interacted with every day, and perhaps this was part of the appeal of the concept. J. Lyons was very careful to maintain the Nippy image as wholesome and proper — strict cleanliness standards applied for Nippy uniforms, and before World War II J. Lyons would not hire married women as Nippies. So popular was the image that miniature Nippy outfits were popular for children dressing up for special events such as fetes. ==Typical pay and conditions== In the mid-1930s, for example in Brighton, a Nippy worked 54 hours per week (11.45 a.m. to 11.45 p.m.), for 26 shillings per week (£1.30), with 2/6d (two shillings and sixpence, £0.125) extra for working at weekends.

Pushkin reciting his poem before old Derzhavin in the Lyceum (painting by Ilya Repin from 1911, the school's centennial). The Imperial Lyceum (Императорский Царскосельский лицей, Imperatorskiy Tsarskosel'skiy litsey) in Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg, also known historically as the Imperial Alexander Lyceum after its founder Tsar Alexander I, was an educational institution which was founded in 1811 with the object of educating youths of the best families who would afterwards occupy important posts in the Imperial service. Its regulations were published on 11 January 1811, but they had received the Imperial sanction on 12 August 1810, when the four-story \\"new\\" wing of the Great Palace was appointed for its accommodation, with special premises for a hospital, a kitchen and other domestic requirements, as well as a residence for the administrative staff. Furniture and utensils were given together with the Neoclassical building, designed by Vasily Stasov, next to the Catherine Palace. The Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum was opened on October 19, 1811. The first graduates included Alexander Pushkin and Alexander Gorchakov. The opening date was celebrated each year with carousals and revels, and Pushkin composed new verses for each of those occasions. In January 1844 the Lyceum was moved to St Petersburg. During the 33 years of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum's existence, there were 286 graduates. The most famous of these, in addition to the above two, were Anton Delvig, Wilhelm Kuchelbecker, Nicholas de Giers, Dmitry Tolstoy, Yakov Grot, Nikolay Danilevsky, Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. ==See also== * List of Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum people ==External links== * THE IMPERIAL LYCEUM (in English) - from Tsarskoye Selo in 1910 * Pushkin and the Lyceum (in Russian) Category:Buildings and structures in Pushkin Category:Vasily Stasov buildings and structures Category:Schools in Saint Petersburg Category:Educational institutions established in 1811 Category:1810s establishments in the Russian Empire Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1917 Category:1917 disestablishments in Russia ","title":"Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum"},{"id":"1437575","text":"The New Adventures of Batman is an animated series that aired on CBS from February 12 to May 28, 1977, featuring the DC Comics superheroes Batman and Robin, and Batgirl. The series was a Filmation and DC Comics production in association with Warner Bros. Television (whose current parent company is WarnerMedia). ==Plot== In The New Adventures of Batman, the \\"Dynamic Duo\\" fights crime in Gotham City, encountering the classic Batman rogues gallery as well as some original villains. Complicating matters is Bat-Mite, a well- meaning imp from another dimension called Ergo, who considers himself Batman's biggest fan. As a result, he wears a variant of Batman’s costume and attempts to help him, only to often create more problems.

Oiled Again!\\") ==Production== ===Development=== In September 1968, before The New Adventures of Batman Filmation Associates had created and aired an animated Batman series (pre-Bat-Mite), named The Batman/Superman Hour, for CBS. This series, the first Saturday Morning vehicle for the Caped Crusader, paired up new Batman and Robin adventures with old Superman/Superboy episodes. In 1969, it was repackaged into 30-minute episodes without the Man of Steel and renamed Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder. The New Adventures of Batman was produced concurrently with Super Friends, which was produced by the competing Hanna- Barbera Productions and included Batman and Robin as members, marking a rare occurrence in animation history which saw two studios simultaneously producing series featuring the same characters. The main distinction was that in Filmation’s series, Batman and Robin were voiced by Adam West and Burt Ward, the lead actors of the 1960s Batman series. Hanna-Barbera's Batman and Robin were voiced by Olan Soule and Casey Kasem, who also voiced the Dynamic Duo for Filmation's 1968 version, The Batman/Superman Hour. ===Airdates=== The New Adventures of Batman originally premiered February 12, 1977 on CBS. The episodes from this series were later aired along with other Filmation shows—such as Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (1976, CBS) —as part of: The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour (1977–1978 CBS), Tarzan and the Super 7 (1978–1980 CBS), and Batman and the Super 7 (1980–1981 NBC). ===Missing villains=== The Riddler and the Scarecrow were off-limits to the show, as Hanna-Barbera already had the rights to the characters for Challenge of the Super Friends (though the Riddler does appear in the opening credits of the show in a pink-colored costume, and was mentioned being arrested at the beginning of the episode \\"The Deep Freeze\\"). This is also the reason why the Joker could not appear in Challenge of the Super Friends, though he was planned as a Legion of Doom member.http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super- friendsdarrell.html ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"margin: auto; !

In the DVD release audio commentary for the 1998-1999 season, Timm and the rest of the series creators (writer Paul Dini, director Dan Riba, artist Glen Murakami, and storyboarder James Tucker) explain that the first segment of the October 10, 1998, episode \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\" purposely makes use of the same designs The New Adventures of Batman used for the Joker, Batman and Robin, as well as the same color schemes and shading in a nod to both The New Adventures of Batman and to Batman artist Dick Sprang, whose style heavily influenced the visuals of the Filmation cartoon (along with Neal Adams). They further explain that the episode segment also purposely makes use of the trademark silliness and corny tone of the original series (which differs from the darker, serious tone of Timm's series) and also mimics the low frame rate animation style used by Filmation. ==References== ==External links== * The New Adventures of Batman at Big Cartoon DataBase * * * Filmation animated series * AOL Television: In2TV: The New Adventures of Batman * Japanese opening to New Adventures of Batman * TVshowsondvd.com: DVD Release * Batman: Yesterday, Today and Beyond - The Batman Homepage - The New Adventures of Batman Category:1977 American television series debuts Category:1977 American television series endings Category:1970s American animated television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:Batman (TV series) Category:CBS original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Batman television series by Filmation Category:NBC original programming Category:American sequel television series Category:Animated television shows based on DC Comics Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

He later became an Executive Vice President with Edelman public relations in Washington, D.C. He was a Visiting Senior Fellow in National-Security Communications at the Heritage Foundation, a weekly contributor to the nationally syndicated public radio programme Left, Right & Center, the author of The West's Last Chance: Will We Win the Clash of Civilizations? and American Grit: What It Will Take to Survive and Win in the 21st Century. He served as the editorial page editor for The Washington Times from 2002-2009. ==Early life== Blankley was briefly a child actor appearing, most notably, as Rod Steiger's son in The Harder They Fall (1956). The movie was, as Blankley liked to joke, both his and his co-star Humphrey Bogart's last movie. He graduated from UCLA and Loyola Law School (Los Angeles), earning a J.D. He was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1972. ==Career== Prior to his career on Capitol Hill, Blankley served President Ronald Reagan as a policy analyst and speechwriter, and was a staff writer for Congresswoman Bobbi Fiedler. Before coming to Washington, D.C., he spent 10 years as a Deputy Attorney General with the California Attorney General's office. His political opinions were generally considered to fall within traditional conservatism although he was labeled as a neoconservative by some critics. He denied that label, claiming that his views are more comparable to a classic conservative such as Reagan. His political career spanned several decades, and his most prominent position was a seven-year stint as House Speaker Newt Gingrich's press secretary. He was a regular commentator for radio shows including The Diane Rehm Show, Left, Right & Center and The Steve Gill Show with a segment titled Fill In the Blanks. Earlier in his career, Blankley was an editorial page editor for The Washington Times, a contributing editor and monthly columnist for George Magazine, and a regular panelist on The McLaughlin Group. He continued to write for The Washington Times. He lectured at many universities and institutes. On November 19, 2009, he presented his lecture, A Year out from the 2010 Congressional Elections – National Politics, Policy and their Communication, at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics of Saint Anselm College. ==Death== Blankley died in Washington, D.C., of stomach cancer on January 7, 2012, at Sibley Memorial Hospital, two weeks before his 64th birthday. ==References== ==External links== * Archives: Tony Blankley, townhall.com * Tony Blankley blog, HuffingtonPost.com * Podcasts of Blankley's recent articles, outloudopinion.com * Left Right & Center, kcrw.com * * * Category:1948 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:American columnists Category:American male child actors Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American political writers Category:American prosecutors Category:California Republicans Category:Deaths from cancer in Washington, D.C.

The wrought iron tubular bridge, which is now Grade I listed, was built in the 19th century. It is the last surviving example of this type of design by Stephenson after the original Britannia Bridge across the Menai Strait was destroyed in a fire in 1970 and replaced by a two-tier truss arch bridge design. The Conway Railway Bridge was designed by railway engineer Robert Stephenson in collaboration with William Fairbairn and Eaton Hodgkinson. The original plan had been for suspension bridge complementing Thomas Telford's Conwy Suspension Bridge of 1826. After Stephenson's appointment as chief engineer, the design was changed because a suspension bridge was considered unsuitable for trains. Stephenson and his collaborators invented the wrought-iron box-girder structure to bridge the River Conwy in a single span. During May 1846, groundwork for the bridge commenced. The architect Francis Thompson (architect) dressed the pylons at either end as barbicans, with crenellated turrets, arrow slits and bartizans to complement the adjacent Conwy Castle. Unusually, the tubes were completed onshore before being attached to pontoons, floated along the river and jacked into position between the abutments. The bridge was officially opened in 1849. The bridge endorsed the construction of the larger Britannia Bridge. During 1899, the tubular sections were reinforced with cast iron columns to reduce the load on the span across the river. In September 1950, Conwy Tubular Bridge was recognised as being a Grade I listed building; it is also a scheduled monument (CN167). ==History== ===Background=== During the 1840s, the Chester and Holyhead Railway committed to building a railway line along the coastline of North Wales between Chester and Holyhead on Anglesey. The line would improve transport and communications in the region and speed up traffic between London and Ireland as part of the national rail network that was under development.“Conwy Tubular Bridge.” engineering-timelines.com’’, Retrieved: 31 May 2018. The route necessitated crossing the River Conwy alongside the existing Conwy Suspension Bridge, built two decades earlier by Thomas Telford. Initially a suspension bridge was considered, but its inherent flexibility posed challenges to rail traffic.\\"Stephenson's Tubular Bridge.\\" historypoints.org, Retrieved: 31 May 2018. Robert Stephenson the chief engineer of the Chester and Holyhead Railway designed the bridge. He devised a tunnel-like rigid tube which would be suspended above the Conwy to accommodate tracks inside it. The box-section tube possessed sufficient rigidity to be self-supporting over span of the river. A lithograph entitled \\"Conway Bridge\\" showing the second wrought-iron box girder tube being floated into position, c. September 1848. Stephenson also deployed he tubular bridge on a larger scale across the Menai Strait between Anglesey and the Welsh mainland, in what was the Britannia Bridge. While developing the design which was made of wrought iron, Stephenson consulted William Fairbairn (who had extensive experience in working with iron), the mathematician Eaton Hodgkinson and resident engineer Edwin Clark. During February 1846, the men presented their design to the company who approved further development and experimentation to validate the design. Several different cross sections were built including a one-sixteenth scale model of the Britannia Bridge, 23.8 meters in length fitted with a rectangular-section tube. Testing incorporated various conditions, including wind and temperature variations. The designs for both the Conwy Railway Bridge and Britannia Bridge were similar. ===Construction=== During May 1846, groundwork for the bridge commenced. On either shore, the underlying bedrock was levelled close to the river’s low water level for the foundations of the towers. For additional support, timber piles were driven at the south east corner of Conwy Tower where the masonry is seated on a wooden platform roughly 600mm below the low water level. The project's architect, Francis Thompson, dressed the pylons at either end as barbicans with crenellated turrets, arrow slits and bartizans to complement the adjacent Conwy Castle that had stood on the promontory since the late 13th century. As designed, the tubes were to be elaborately decorated meant to resemble castle walls with machicolated cornices, stringcourses and loopholes. The fitting of external decorations was abandoned on the grounds of expense and extra weight. The bridge contractor was William Evan. The ironwork was constructed by Easton & Amos. On 15 June 1846, the foundation stone of the towers was laid. The towers accommodated entrance portals within twin arches, through which the railway are carried into the tubes. The tubes are made of 16mm riveted wrought iron with cellular roofs and bases, and sheeted sides; each one weighs roughly 1,320 tonnes. The tubes, which are 129.2 meters long and 4.4 meters wide, were constructed using shipbuilding techniques. Once completed onshore, they were attached to pontoons, floated along the river and jacked into position between the abutments; steam-powered hydraulic engines lifted the bridge elements into place. On 6 March 1848, the first tube was floated; its installation took nine days to complete. ===Operational life=== The bridge was officially opened in 1849, although the first tube had been completed for traffic during April 1848. Stephenson wanted to test the structure, the first tubular crossing, to be sure it was capable of carrying the weight of a locomotive and its rolling stock. The testing was performed by Fairbairn and achieved favourable results. The bridge effectively endorsed the construction of the larger Britannia Bridge.\\"About Conwy Railway Bridge.\\" Transport Trust, Retrieved: 31 May 2018. During 1899, the tubular sections were reinforced with cast iron columns to reduce the load on the span across the river to accommodate the increasingly heavy trains being used on the route. The bridge's weight capacity had been exceeded according to a survey. The columns were fitted with inspection gantries to ease maintenance but during the 2000s they were deemed to be unnecessary and were removed.\\"Conwy Tubular Railway Bridge.\\" kaymacmarine.co.uk, 20 June 2014. In September 1950, Conwy Tubular Bridge was recognised as being a Grade I listed structure; it is also a scheduled monument (CN167), protecting it as a historical asset for the nation. By the 21st century, the bridge is the only surviving example of a tubular bridge designed by Stephenson. The original Britannia Bridge was damaged beyond repair by fire in 1970; it was rebuilt as a two-tier truss arch bridge made of steel and concrete. The bridge is maintained by Network Rail as a part of the British railway network. Its heritage is protected and actively managed by Cadw, the historic environment organisation of the Welsh Government. ==See also== *Sharp, Roberts & Co. *List of bridges in Wales ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * == External links == * Aerial photo * Local tourist information * General description of the Britannia and Conway tubular bridges on the Chester and Holyhead Railway, 1849, from Google Book Search Category:Bridges completed in 1848 Category:Bridges in Conwy County Borough Category:Buildings and structures in Conwy Category:Tubular bridges Category:Railway bridges in Wales Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks Category:Grade I listed buildings in Conwy County Borough Category:Grade I listed bridges in Wales ","title":"Conwy Railway Bridge"},{"id":"1437652","text":"right The germ of a cereal is the reproductive part that germinates to grow into a plant; it is the embryo of the seed. Along with bran, germ is often a by-product of the milling that produces refined grain products. Cereal grains and their components, such as wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, and maize, may be used as a source from which vegetable oil is extracted, or used directly as a food ingredient. The germ is retained as an integral part of whole-grain foods. Non-whole grain methods of milling are intended to isolate the endosperm, which is ground into flour, with removal of both the husk (bran) and the germ. Removal of bran is aimed at producing a flour with a white rather than a brown color, and eliminating fiber, which reduces nutrition. The germ is rich in polyunsaturated fats (which have a tendency to oxidize and become rancid on storage) and so germ removal improves the storage qualities of flour. ==Wheat germ== Wheat germ or wheatgerm is a concentrated source of several essential nutrients, including vitamin E, folate (folic acid), phosphorus, thiamin, zinc, and magnesium, as well as essential fatty acids and fatty alcohols. It is a good source of fiber. White bread is made using flour that has had the germ and bran removed. Wheat germ can be added to protein shakes, casseroles, muffins, pancakes, cereals, yogurt, smoothies, cookies, and other goods. Wheat germ can become rancid if not properly stored in a refrigerator or freezer and away from sunlight. Some manufacturers prevent rancidity by storing wheat germ in vacuum-sealed glass containers, or by placing an oxygen-absorbing sachet inside air-tight packaging. ==Other uses== In molecular biology, wheat germ extract is used to carry out cell-free in vitro translation experiments since the plant embryo contains all the macromolecular components necessary for translating mRNA into amino acids but relatively low levels of its own mRNA.In Vitro Translation: The Basics, Ambion Wheat germ is also useful in biochemistry since it contains lectins that bind strongly to certain glycoproteins; therefore, it can be used to isolate such proteins. ==See also== * Endosperm * Health food * Wheat germ oil * Samanu ==Notes== Category:Cereals Category:Food ingredients ","title":"Cereal germ"},{"id":"1437661","text":"Shannon Development (legally the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited formerly known as SFADCO) was an important regional development body for the Shannon Region of Ireland. Its area in the lower River Shannon basin comprised all of counties Clare, Limerick, and the former North Tipperary, as well as north Kerry and west Offaly. Its key founder was Brendan O'Regan. Shannon Development worked with, but was not an agency of, Forfás. ==Responsibility== Shannon Development was set up as Shannon Free Airport Development Company by the Irish Government in 1959 to promote the airport and region. Shannon Airport was built at a strategic point on the early transatlantic flying route, but with the age of the jet, its fortunes declined. In 1969 Aer Rianta took responsibility of the airport. Shannon Development was responsible for a number of areas of development of the region including tourism and industry similar to IDA Ireland. The agency was responsible for Shannon Free Zone and National Technology Park on which the University of Limerick is located. Shannon Town was also created and managed by the company until it was transferred to Clare County Council in 2004. This property transfer was the biggest property transaction in the history of the state. Shannon Development also acted as a landlord for many companies in the region. Companies that qualify, paid rent to Shannon Development. In return the company can apply for Enterprise Ireland grant funding through Shannon Development. This constitutes a symbiotic relationship. The Government has reviewed the role of the agency in July 2005 and its functions are being realigned. Under the new arrangements, Shannon Development will have an enhanced regional economic development role with a particular emphasis on addressing the needs of the less developed parts of the Shannon region. It will also retain responsibility for the Shannon Free Zone industrial park.

It was also released for the Game Boy in Japan as and in North America as the same name as the North American NES release. It is the first game in Kemco's Crazy Castle series and the only one that was released for a home console; the four subsequent games in the series were released on handheld devices. (This only includes games with the Crazy Castle title; a game in the Japanese Mickey Mouse series was reworked into Kid Klown in Night Mayor World, which saw an NES release and a sequel on Super NES but was not otherwise connected with the North American Crazy Castle games.) Three different versions starred three different cartoon characters: Bugs Bunny, and Disney's Roger Rabbit and Mickey Mouse, and were first released in 1989. The object of the game is to guide Bugs through a series of rooms collecting carrots. However, four rascals are guarding the castle: Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and Wile E. Coyote. ==Gameplay== While presented in a side- scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny did not have the ability to jump; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a \\"puzzle-solving\\" atmosphere. Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects. Because most NES game cartridges lacked the ability to save, passwords can be used to start at a certain level in this game. ==Plot== Honey Bunny has been kidnapped by Wile E. Coyote, Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, and Sylvester, and Bugs must travel through 60 levels (80 in the Game Boy version) in order to save her. To get past each level, Bugs must collect all 8 carrots in each level. ==Characters== There are four enemy characters - Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and Yosemite Sam. However, the Sylvester character has three variations - two gray, one green and one pink, Daffy has two variations, one being dark gray and one brown, and Yosemite Sam being either in blue or brown. * Gray Sylvester - can only travel up a floor or a tube; cannot bypass a door or tube without going through it; cannot go under staircases; cannot stop moving; two of this kind can be used in a single level. * Green Sylvester - can travel both up and down a floor or tube; can bypass a door or tube without going through it; can go under staircases; cannot stop moving. * Pink Sylvester - can only travel up a floor or a tube; cannot bypass a door or tube without going through it; cannot go under staircases; able to stop moving after a short distance travelled. * Yosemite Sam / Wile E. Coyote - cannot go through doors or tubes; once they've traveled down a staircase, they can't go back up; cannot stop moving. * Daffy Duck - cannot go through doors or tubes; once he has traveled down a staircase, he can't go back up; able to stop moving after a short distance travelled. ==Development== The North American NES game is a modified version of the Japan-exclusive Family Computer Disk System title, Roger Rabbit. Roger Rabbit is the game's playable character, all the villains are Who Framed Roger Rabbit-related, and hearts are collected. Due to Capcom owning the rights to develop and publish Disney film-based video games, as well as LJN already having published Rare's own video game adaptation of the film, Kemco decided to use Bugs Bunny, due to he and Roger both being rabbits, making it easier for Kemco to modify the Roger Rabbit game and release it outside Japan as The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle. For the Game Boy version, Kemco's license to develop and/or publish video games based on Who Framed Roger Rabbit became outdated; however, they still had the license to create Disney-based video games, which they used to create Mickey Mouse for Game Boy. An early beta version of the game shows the working title as Bugs Bunny Fun House. In 1997, Kemco released the Game Boy version along with The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2 in one cartridge under the name Bugs Bunny Collection GB. ==Reception== The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle had mostly positive reception. The Game Boy version was the most popular and received critical praise. The NES version was also a commercial success. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 video games Category:Kemco games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Game Boy games Category:Video games based on Looney Tunes Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring Bugs Bunny ","title":"The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle"},{"id":"1437676","text":"The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) was a trade union, teachers' union and professional association, affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, in the United Kingdom representing educators from nursery and primary education to further education.

ATL had members throughout England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and British Service schools overseas. The ATL brand continues as a section or subsidiary of the National Education Union. ==Governance and administration== ATL was led by its Executive Committee who were assisted by a General Secretary. All senior officers and officials were elected by an Association wide ballot and the overall direction was determined by the Annual Conference which had delegates from each branch.

The origins of ATL go back to 1884 when 180 women met to create the Association of Assistant Mistresses (AAM). These women worked in schools founded for higher education of girls. Their concern was primarily for the pupils. However, in 1921, the AAM appointed representatives to the newly formed Burnham Committee on Salaries in Secondary Schools. 1891 saw the formation of the Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools (AMA). Its purpose was to protect and improve the conditions of service of secondary teachers. Between 1899 and 1908 it played an influential part in obtaining security of tenure for assistant teachers through the Endowed Schools Act. Then in 1978 AAM and AMA merged to form the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association (AMMA) with a membership of approximately 75,000. The name was changed in 1993 to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). ATL affiliated to the TUC in 1999. It resigned from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in 2015.

Most of the train derailed, killing eleven people. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the accident attributed the cause to the truck driver trying to beat the train across a grade crossing. The NTSB's recommendations from the accident included increased enforcement of grade crossing signals, the installation of train event recorders at all new or improved grade crossings, and procedures to provide emergency responders with accurate lists of all crew members and passengers aboard trains. The city of Bourbonnais erected a memorial near the site to commemorate those killed in the accident. == Accident == At approximately 9:47 pm Central (local) time on March 15, 1999, Amtrak's City of New Orleans number 59 was operating southbound through Bourbonnais, Illinois, on tracks owned by the Illinois Central Railroad (four months later, the IC folded into the Canadian National Railway). It was pulled by two GE P40DC locomotives, #807 leading and #829 trailing. 207 passengers and 21 crew members were on board at the time of the accident. While operating through Bourbonnais, the train's engineer observed a semi-trailer truck loaded with steel slowly crossing the tracks at a grade crossing. When the engineer realized the truck was not going to clear the tracks in time, he engaged the train's emergency brake. However, the train was traveling at and was unable to stop in time. Both of the train's locomotives and eleven of the train's fourteen passenger cars derailed; the derailed cars struck freight cars on an adjacent siding. Eleven people aboard the train were killed and another 121 were transported to nearby hospitals with serious injuries. The driver of the semi-truck, John R. Stokes, was also injured. The crash also resulted in over US$14 million in damage. == Investigations == === NTSB investigation === The NTSB attributed the cause of the wreck to Stokes's reaction to the grade crossing signals. Thinking he could beat the train across the tracks, Stokes chose to proceed onto the tracks in front of the train. Stokes reported that the crossing signal did not activate until his vehicle was \\"right on top of the track,\\" but he also stated that he did not want to brake quickly to avoid a shifting load that could hit the back of the truck's cab. Witnesses stated that the gates came down after the truck had entered the grade crossing. One witness stated that the gate clipped the truck's trailer and that part of the gate may have broken off as a result. The accident's fatalities were found in the third car from the engines, sleeper car 32035, due to warping of the coach, a piece of running rail piercing it, and fire damage. As a result of the accident, the NTSB made several recommendations: * To the highway maintainers: ** Review the effectiveness of current railroad grade crossing signals and the use of traffic division islands in deterring motorists from trying to drive around crossing gates. * To the United States Secretary of Transportation: ** Provide further grants and incentives to increase enforcement of grade crossing signals. * To the United States Federal Railroad Administration: ** Require the installation of event recorders to monitor gate position at new or improved grade crossings. * To the railroads: ** Initiate procedures to get accurate passenger and crew lists to emergency responders. ** Implement improved crew accountability procedures on reserved passenger trains. ** Install event recorders on all new or improved grade crossings. === Local civil and criminal investigations === The accident was also investigated by Illinois state and local agencies. Stokes had been convicted of numerous traffic violations in the past, and his trucking company, Melco Transfer Inc., had been cited for safety violations. Although the NTSB's investigation placed the fault of the collision on Stokes and his failure to yield at the grade crossing, the Illinois State Police concluded that the crossing lights were flashing, as expected, but the crossing gates were not functioning correctly and failed to be lowered until Stokes had already begun crossing the tracks. The Illinois Attorney General reviewed the case for criminal charges, but due to the conflicting agency reports, it was ultimately determined that the evidence would be insufficient to charge Stokes for the eleven deaths. \\"Stokes never faced more serious charges, such as involuntary manslaughter, in the accident that also injured 122 people because prosecutors at the time did not believe they could meet the burden of proof,\\" said a spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general's office. Instead, prosecutors obtained a grand jury indictment against Stokes in September 2001 for one count of willful violation of maximum driving time in violation of Illinois statute 625 ILCS 5/18b-108 (incorporating 49 C.F.R. 395.3) and willful violation of driver's record of duty in violation of Illinois statute 625 ILCS 5/18b-108 (incorporating 49 C.F.R. 395.8), both felonies. He was found guilty on both counts in August 2004. Stokes was sentenced on September 21, 2004, to two years in prison for logbook, manslaughter, and hours of service violations. At sentencing, Kankakee County Judge Clark Erickson stated that it was not proven if a lack of rest played a factor in the wreck but that he believed Stokes would have been more able to make safe driving decisions if he had been fully rested. Stokes was later found to have had multiple violations that required his attendance of traffic school five times in three different counties, which should have resulted in his license being suspended at the time of the wreck. He died in February 2007 from a cerebral hemorrhage. ==Aftermath== Following the collision, the city of Bourbonnais erected a memorial to the deceased victims at the intersection of Highway 45 and 102, across from the Olivet Nazarene University campus. On January 17, 2006, the Village Board of Bourbonnais voted to permanently close the grade crossing where the accident occurred. A replacement crossing will be built at another location nearby that will, the Village Board hopes, prevent similar wrecks from occurring in the future. At least thirty-one civil cases were filed in various courts against parties involved in the wreck. In Illinois, the court placed the cause of the wreck squarely on Stokes, finding: Prior to one trial, Stokes and Melco settled with all the plaintiffs. ==See also== *List of rail accidents (1990–99) *Glendale train crash. simmilar crash with driver causing the train to derail and the same amount of Casualties ==References== Category:Railway accidents and incidents in Illinois Category:Railway accidents in 1999 Category:Road incidents in the United States Category:1999 road incidents Category:1999 in Illinois Category:Accidents and incidents involving Amtrak Category:Accidents and incidents involving Illinois Central Railroad Category:Railroad crossing accidents in the United States Category:Derailments in the United States Category:Transportation disasters in Illinois Category:Kankakee County, Illinois Category:1999 disasters in the United States ","title":"1999 Bourbonnais, Illinois, train crash"},{"id":"1437688","text":"Basic electronic drum set made by Pintech. An electronic drum is a modern electronic musical instrument, primarily designed to serve as an alternative to an acoustic drum kit or other percussion instruments. An electronic drum consists of an electronic or digital sound module which produces the synthesized or sampled percussion sounds and one or more electric sensors or sensor-equipped pads to trigger the sounds. Like regular drums, the sensors or pads are struck by drum sticks or by the hands (depending on the type of drum pad) and they are played in a similar manner to an acoustic drum kit (or percussion instrument). Strictly speaking, modules playing pre-programmed electronic drum tracks and electronic or digital drum machines are not electronic drums, because the program, not a drummer or other musician, is triggering the sounds.[For the definition employed here cf: -'The Case for Vintage Electronic Drums' by Michael Render, page 1 (originally published in the Not So Modern Drumming Magazine) & sourced from \\"The Electronic Drum Experts\\" web site] The electronic drum (pad/triggering device) is usually sold as part of an electronic drum kit, consisting of a set of drum pads mounted on a stand or rack in a configuration similar to that of an acoustic drum kit layout, with rubberized (Roland, Yamaha, Alesis, for example) or specialized acoustic/electronic cymbals (e.g. Zildjian's \\"Gen 16\\"). The drum pads themselves are either discs or shallow drum shells made of various materials, often with a rubber/silicone or cloth-like coated playing surface that provides some rebound to sticks. Each pad has one or more sensors that generates an electronic signal when struck. The electronic signal is transmitted through cables into an electronic or digital drum module (\\"brain\\" as it is sometimes called), synthesizer or other device, which then produces a sound associated with, and triggered by, the struck pad. The sound signal from the drum module can be plugged into a keyboard amp or PA system for use in a live band performance, listened to with headphones for silent practice, or patched into an audio mixer for a recording session. Since digital drums have become more popular in the 2000s, companies have started selling digital electronic drum kit sound files, referred to as \\"drum kits\\". While electronic drum kits are typically used to trigger drum and percussion sounds, a MIDI- equipped electronic drum kit can be used to trigger any types of MIDI sounds, such as synthesized or sampled piano, guitar, or any other instrument or sound. ==History== ===1960s-1970s=== In 1967, Felix Visser, a drummer playing with the Dutch pop band the VIPs, DIY-modified one of the pre-Roland Music-era Ace Tone electronic rhythm box-drum machines, which was intended to play simple pre-programmed rhythms, so that it could be played as a live instrument. The Ace Tone rhythm box was designed by Ikutaro Kakehashi, who later founded Roland Corporation Japan. As with all rhythm boxes and later drum computers, before a \\"human feel\\" was developed by introducing subtle variation and \\"swing\\", the Ace Tone rhythm boxes had a metronomic, machine- like sound. In Visser's modification, the Ace Tone box was extended with a large flat board holding 12 printed circuit boards of approximately 4 × 4 inches, with the copper traces intertwining like forks. The copper traces formed the touch surfaces for the sounds generated by the Ace Tone box. Each touch pad was sensed by an electronic circuit driving high-speed Siemens computer relays he found in surplus shops. These were connected to the drum and percussion sounds of the rhythm box. Although it was a crude way of playing electronic drum sounds by hand (like a percussionist playing bongos and congas), it worked and added a \\"human feel\\". Visser's approach enabled drummers to have a new type of virtuosity (e.g., rolls on electronic bass drums could be played with sticks). The unit was used in Frans Peters' studio in radio city Hilversum, Netherlands. The system was over-sensitive to humidity: > \\"The circuits would be triggered by the touch pads, merely by damp. Just > breathing over them would do the job. So in the end a 40 Watt light bulb was > built inside the box holding the pads, electronic circuitry and relays, to > heat up the unit when the instrument had been sitting in a car and then put > on a stage in a relatively warm, damp environment. After all we'd just left > the dark ages of electronic music... \\" The first electronic drum was created in the early 1970s by Graeme Edge, drummer of The Moody Blues, in collaboration with Sussex University Professor Brian Groves. The device was used in the song \\"Procession\\" from the 1971 album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.Render, Michael.

It consisted of an electric sound generator and one or more drum pads. It quickly caught the attention of numerous high- profile drummers/percussionists at the time, such as Carmine Appice and Terry Bozzio. However, the Syndrum was a financial failure and the company failed in the following years. In 1978, the Simmons company was created to produce commercial electronic drums sets. Its most notable product was the SDS-5, released in 1981. With its characteristic hexagon-shaped pads, the SDS-5 was first used by Richard James Burgess on From the Tea-rooms of Mars ...., \\"Chant No. 1\\" by Spandau Ballet, and \\"Angel Face\\" by Shock. After its debut on the top musical chart shows and parades, this electronic instrument garnered significant attention from established and influential rock/pop musicians. The sound of the SDS-5 is often described retrospectively with phrases such as \\"awful\\" or \\"sounded like trash can lids\\" by those who employed them at the time. Despite the critics, the distinctive Simmons sound was extensively used during the 1980s by pop/rock & synth-pop groups such as Duran Duran and progressive rock bands such as Rush, among others. Simmons drums are often viewed somewhat nostalgically by those who began to experiment with these early forays into electronic drums and percussion. ===1980s-1990s=== Simmons SDS 5 Electronic Drums, ca. 1983. In the following 1980s, other companies started selling their own versions of Simmons' electronic drums, notably Pearl, Roland and Yamaha. At that time, electronic drums were similar to 2016-era starter or entry-level kits. They consisted of rubber-coated sensor pads mounted on stands. The pads were created to be velocity-sensitive and the sound was generated through single or multiple-layered sampling or synthesized sound. In 1997, Roland introduced its TD-10 model, which had two major musical and electronic innovations. The first and more controversial innovation was its method of providing noises for the drums/pads to trigger, instead of generating its sound by using samples of an acoustic drum or cymbal. The TD-10 used mathematical models to generate tones using synthesizers. While some drummers lamented the fact that the produced sound was not a \\"pure\\" sample of an acoustic instrument, others argued that simple replication of an acoustic drum was not desirable. Secondly, instead of rubber-coated pads, Roland featured a new mesh-like pad, produced in collaboration with acoustic drum skin manufacturer Remo. The mesh-head pads look and feel approximately like a smaller-sized acoustic drum (although the wooden shell is much smaller). The Remo/Roland mesh surface is made from a double layer of taut woven mesh fibers, fitted with several electronic sensors or triggers. The playing feel is close to that of striking an acoustic drum, but with more bounce than an acoustic skin. Roland termed its commercial drum set \\"V-Drums\\", which later became the marketed brand name of its electronic drum line. Together, the mathematical/computational modeling, mesh-head pad surface, and improved trigger sensor technology greatly increased the quality of sounds, the \\"realistic\\" feel of electronic drums, and the volume levels in practice and live show settings.Greg Rule & Steve Fisher. V-Drums History. , accessed June 21, 2011 ===2000s-2010s=== Roland V-Stage Series TD-12S V-Drum Kit. On the left is the \\"brain\\", the module that controls the drum sounds and enables the performer to select from different types of drum kit and control the volume. In the 2010s drum kits from major manufacturers have therefore addressed many of the shortcomings of early electronic drum pads and modules. While each of the significant market brands have entry-level units, the professionally marketed kits are geared toward creating sounds and playing experiences that are nearly indistinguishable from playing a quality acoustic kit or world/orchestral percussion instruments. Examples of these high-end professional kits include the Yamaha DTX 950k and Roland V-Drums TD-30KV. Professional kits generally have higher-quality digital sounds These drum modules offer high quality modeled drum sounds – with hundreds of onboard sounds, effects and audio loops and song options/patterns to choose from. Some of these modules allow the user to select tuning, head type, depth/width and material (metal, wood type, etc.). Trigger sensor/reliability and reduction of crosstalk have been vastly improved. Triggering now allows both the head and the rim to produce different sounds, facilitating rim and cross shots as well as shell tapping and many other audio sounds that can be assigned to the head or rim, so that the options for live music increase even more. Cymbals can accommodate more zones: for edge, bow and bell strikes with different sounds, with choking capability and realistic cymbal swells. They have more realistic hi-hats - Acoustic hi-hat cymbals are mounted on in a pair on a stand with a foot pedal enabling the drummer to open and close the hi-hats, which enables drummers to create a wide variety of hi-hat effects, depending on whether the pair of cymbals are fully closed, partially closed, or open. These newer electronic versions are no longer single cymbal pads as in the 1980s, but dual replicated cymbals, that can be mounted on regular stands like their acoustic versions. These cymbals allow for actual opened and closed hand/foot playing. An electronic module detects hi-hat movement/height and position, providing realistic variations of hi-hat sound via degree of placement – open, partially open, and closed hi-hat strikes. Some modules, like the Roland TD-30, also feature foot close and quick close-open sounds, with pressure on the cymbals also being sensed and replicated when tightening or loosening the foot pressure, even on a closed hi-hat. So, the audio sounds tighter when firm pressure is applied on an already closed hi-hat pedal. Compared with 1980s and early 1990s kits, the 2010s modules offer far more outputs. The professional- level modules from the leading manufacturers have multiple outputs to the sound board such that each percussion group (i.e. toms, cymbals, etc...) can be independently mixed (like the multiple miking of an acoustic kit). This means a drummer can add one effect to, say, the cymbals, while adding a different effect to the drums. As well, this enables a drummer to create a monitor mix that is different than the \\"front of house\\" mix sounding on the PA system. For example, if a bandleader wished to have a very quiet bass drum, the bass drum volume level in the \\"front of house\\" mix would be low. If the drummer needed to be able to hear her bass drum part to get a solid groove, she might turn up her bass drum in her personal monitor speaker, which would not affect the volume from the \\"front of house\\" speakers. As these groups have independent volume faders on the module to fine-tune volume settings for each group. Another commonly designated output is the MIDI connection, which sends signals to a computer based specialist MIDI software, a groovebox, or a DAW (digital audio workstation). The increased processing power provided by this option allows the user to utilize actual, randomized samples of professionally recorded or modeled drums. The output and input of the pads, trigger devices etc. can be augmented or controlled through digital software, the module, MIDI instruments and other samplers. Drummers may be able to get a more nuanced sound from the 2010s-era electronic drums. ==Elements== The drum module for the Yamaha DTxpress IV electronic drum kit. ===Sensors and pads=== The sensor- embedded pads and plastic cymbals are mounted on a stand or on multiple stands, so that the drummer can put them in the desired position. ===Drum module=== The electronic drum module is the equivalent to the synth module for electronic drums. It contains the electronic and digital circuitry which produces the synthesized drum sound or the triggered samples. The drum module has a number of faders, buttons and knobs on the front or top so that the drummer can make changes. There is usually some type of display, to give the drummer information about the settings and status. This may include an LCD or LED screen and individual LEDs that light up when sensors are triggered. The drum module is typically mounted on a stand, so that the drummer can easily reach it and see its display and other visual indicators. On the rear or top of the drum module is a patch bay, with a number of labelled jacks for plugging in the sensors, audio outs, and MIDI in or outs. Drum modules typically contain \\"drum kit\\" presets in their memory. Each drum kit has different sounds, such as jazz drums played with a \\"brushes\\" sound, rock drums, Latin drums, African drums, or 1980s-era drum machine synthesized drum sounds (like the TR-808 kick drum sound, for example). Some electronic drum modules, such as Roland's TD-12, even include non-drum sounds, such as organ, electric bass, orchestra, and so on, which can be triggered using the drum kit sensors. Some presets also include effects appropriate to the drum kit or its associated genre. The drum module may also contain effect units, such as audio compression, reverb, and equalization. The drum module may offer controls to adjust the sensitivity of the different pads and cymbals, change the sound of the tuning of the drums, adjust the \\"buzz\\" of the snare, the muffling of the bass drum, and so on. Some drum modules incorporate features of drum machines or sequencers, such as the capability to play pre-programmed drum beats, so that the live drummer can play along with them. ===Sound system=== Some electronic drum manufacturers sell electronic drum-specific combination amplifiers, which contain a power amplifier and one or more speakers in a wooden, wedge-shaped cabinet. The wedge shape is designed so that the speaker is directed at a seated drummer, much like a vocalist's monitor speaker will often be wedge-shaped. Some electronic drummers use keyboard amplifiers or PA systems (both of which are full-range systems). For individual practice, headphones can be connected to the drum module's headphone jack. ===Other gear=== A bass drum pedal may be needed in some kits. As well, some electronic cymbals can be mounted on regular cymbal stands. Drummers also use accessories, such as a drum throne, which is a small padded stool. ==Comparison to acoustic drum set== John Blackwell Jr. used electronic drums in his shows. === Advantages === * Although not totally silent because they are still being played by striking a stick on the surface of the drum heads, electronic drums and their counterpart devices usually produce considerably less acoustic noise than a traditional drum kit. Also, the drummer can use headphones for an essentially silent and private practice in dwellings where it would be impossible to have a studio or acoustic noise level, and perhaps where regular-sized kits would not fit. * They are much lighter, smaller, and easier to transport than an acoustic drum kit. Electronic drum sets are (usually) more compact than acoustic drums- though it is possible to have them customized to acoustic sizes – or convert acoustic kits to become one and so that alters their size benefits, depending on your choice. * A single electronic kit can (via its module or software) simulate the sounds of countless acoustic kits and instruments/effects. A drummer in a cover band or wedding band can switch instantly, for instance, from a vintage jazz drum kit to a powerful maple rock kit for a hard rock song, to a TR-808-sounding synthesized drum sound for a house music cover song. Other options include congas, piano, guitar, brushes, orchestral timpani, gongs or even add hand claps or sound effects such as a sirens. In the 2010s, many non-musical samples and effects are available. It is therefore possible to achieve much more than one can with an acoustic kit alone and one has to transport significantly less kit to play a wide variety of sounds and instruments. * Electronic drums do not require complex and expensive microphones or their large stand arrangements for recording, unlike acoustic drums. Instead, the sound can be obtained through line-out or MIDI connections. Because of this, an electronic drum is good for education, practice, composition applications. The best-quality electronic drums and drum modules can even be used in studio recording or live performance. * Electronic drums usually have useful features for both the aspiring beginner or professional alike, such as metronomes with different metronome \\"voices\\"; play-along songs/loops and samples, with the ability to record practising or playing; syncing of the metronome to a studio DAW metronome instead of using the studio's click; or experimenting with composition. It is also easy to use an MP3 player or iPod to play songs for practice or for looping those parts to target technique issues or replicate drum parts. * Electronic drums can be played at a significantly lower volume level, and so are less restrictive for use, avoiding the need for the rest of a band or other quieter musicians to have to increase their volume acoustically or electronically to match the percussive volume level. This is particularly advantageous in coffeehouse and cafe stages, smaller rooms, or older architectural theatres or churches, where excessive volume is not necessarily desired and can dominate in a way that is difficult and time- consuming to solve (with acoustic drums, some small venues use plexiglass screens to reduce the onstage drum volume). * When equipment such as sticks, brushes (vinyl brushes for mesh heads) and mallets are used with electronic drums, they last slightly longer than on acoustic kits, due to the use of rubberized rims and hoop protection that prevents stick contact with metal. *They can be used to control or sample from other MIDI instruments or work with other samplers (Roland SPD-SX, or Yamaha DTX Multi-12), or percussion pads (Alesis Percussion Pad, Roland SPD-30 Octapad/Handsonic- HPD 20 or the Yamaha DTX Multi-12). They also work well alongside digital audio workstation software for using samples rather than modeled computer-generated sounds. As well, the drum playing can be sent via MIDI to a computer program such as a scorewriter. === Disadvantages === * Electronic drums do not perfectly reproduce the sound of acoustic drum kits. Even if a good-quality electronic drum kit uses sampled acoustic drums, the sample for a given drum or cymbal will sound the same when it is repeated, whereas an acoustic drum or cymbal's sound can be subtly changed on repeated strikes. (Replacing acoustic drums may not be the entire scope or purpose of electronic kits in 2019, but it is still a large priority for many customers.) * Unlike acoustic kits, for which most of the individual drums and cymbals can be combined, the individual drums, sensors, pads, modules, and cables of an electronic kit may be incompatible with those of other models or brands. * Important features such as realistic- feeling pads and advanced, realistic sound modeling or samples are generally limited to expensive sets. Entry-level electronic kits generally use single triggered rubberized hard pads and modest-quality samples or sound modeling. Even expensive kits have limitations, as compared with acoustic kits; for example, even an expensive electronic cymbal with multiple sensors might not be able to sense strikes to the bottom cymbal, which can be done on an acoustic cymbal. * Unlike acoustic drum kits, which are powerful enough to be audible in a small gig without amplification, electronic kits need at least one power outlet and a keyboard amplifier or small PA system to be audible. * The quality of the sounds reproduced by an electronic kit depends on the quality of the sound module, samples, amplifier, personal monitors, headphones, satellite speakers, or audio system used by the performer. *Every region has regulations on electronic equipment. Bands that are on tour with electronic drums will need to do maintenance and periodic tests of the equipment. As well, bands that are crossing international borders may need accurate paperwork for their electronic drums. Cables, plugs, adapters, earthing, and any sign of damage or modification without the proper paperwork could nullify a band's or a venue's insurance policy. Occasionally a venue may require a risk assessment before electronic drums can be used on stage. ==Variations== === Table-top electronic drum === Alesis PerformancePad electronic drum kit A table-top electronic drum (or portable electronic drum) is an electronic drum that has all of its pads (except foot pedals) and the electronic sound module combined in a single table-top unit. It may have a small amplifier and small loudspeakers incorporated so that it can be used at jam sessions without plugging into a PA system. The sound generation is generally simpler (single-layered samples) when compared to more expensive, full-size electronic kits. Also, the feel when playing a table-top drum/pad is very different from using a full-size electronic kit or an acoustic kit. The advantages of table-top drums are their portability and the relatively lower price. Some acoustic drummers use a table-top electronic drum as their first foray into electronic drumming, since purchasing a single table-top unit and setting it up alongside an acoustic drum kit is much cheaper and simpler than fitting an entire acoustic kit with sensors and connecting them to a \\"drum brain\\" module. With a table-top drum mounted on a stand, a drummer who has an otherwise acoustic drum kit could add different drum and percussion sounds to her playing, such as synthesized drum sounds, or samples of a percussion instrument that would otherwise be impractical to have onstage (e.g., a large gong). === Acoustic triggered drum kit === An acoustic triggered drum kit is a regular acoustic drum kit coupled with drum trigger/s (sensors) on the drums and cymbals. The triggers can be \\"built inside\\" or permanently fixed on to cymbals–so that they are necessarily either: fixed triggers (electronic kit essentially), removable (can be either acoustic or electronic by default of purpose at the time), or simply an acoustic kit that is now actually a \\"Hybrid\\" kit–using external triggers that attach to the rim and skin (or batter head) so as to trigger other sounds on top of the natural acoustic sound produced or simply to boost it for performance. The triggers detect hits/ vibrations on the batter head and/or hoop rim and generate an electric signal. The signal is then sent to an electronic module/sampler or via cables and an Audio Interface to MIDI-DAW/drum software on a PC/laptop/Mac–to trigger the selected sounds. Usually, the \\"acoustic triggered kit\\" has either commercially available mesh head \\"skins\\" (silent), or the drummer keeps her natural skins (using acoustic skins for a Hybrid kit are standard practice) and other muting accessories to reduce the acoustic sounds generated when played. This way, an acoustic (electro/acoustic) or Hybrid triggered drum kit has the feel and sizes of the standard acoustic kit but with the added benefits of an electronic kit's onstage silence, controllable volume (an important factor in small venues) or the added sound library available in 2016-era high-end kits, which includes sounds for large gongs and other instruments that are expensive and hard to transport in their original acoustic form.See Craig Blundell on: \\"Hybrid Kits\\" & Roland V Drums, \\"Triggers\\" & Trigger bar on YouTube; See 682Drums for materials on conversions and DD Drums, Hart Dynamics Drum-tech or Pintech for Custom Acoustic/Electronic Kit sizes, that function dualistically or primarily as electronic kits but in various acoustic sizes). DrumsAnywhere softwareMusicRadar Article: https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/drumsanywhere-turns-any-surface-into-a- drum-kit-603584 uses a single piezoelectric microphone to trigger eight different drum pads on any flat or irregular surface, such as a table or wooden chair. ===Hybrid kit=== Some drummers have a mixture of acoustic drums and cymbals and electronic drum equipment (sensor pads and a \\"drum brain\\"). For example, a drummer who finds that her cymbals are too loud in the small venues they play in may use electronic cymbals, but acoustic drums otherwise. On the other end of the spectrum, a drummer who has mostly electronic drums may add a few acoustic drums or cymbals to the kit to add timbral variety or \\"colour\\". This hybrid kit mixes traditional acoustic instruments with sensor- equipped electronic drum gear. ==Selected notable users== The List of electronic drum performers gives a sense of the wide range of genres of the musical artists and bands who incorporate electronic drums into their shows and recordings. The list ranges from progressive rock (Bill Bruford of King Crimson and Yes) and nu metal (Rob Bourdon of Linkin Park) to reggae (Sly Dunbar of Black Uhuru) and alternative music (Alan Wilder of Depeche Mode). ==Notes== Category:Drum machines Category:Percussion instruments Category:Synthesizers Category:MIDI Category:Rhythm section Category:Electronic musical instruments Category:Musical instruments invented in the 1970s Category:Hip hop production Category:Electronic dance music ","title":"Electronic drum"},{"id":"1437703","text":"USS Cardinal may refer to: *, was a that served between World War I and World War II. *, was built as the civilian fishing boat Jeanne D'Arc, then acquired and used by the Navy as a minesweeper during World War II. * The construction of Cardinal (AM-393) was canceled in November 1945 before launching. *, was first commissioned as YMS-179, a during World War II.

They are widespread in tropical and semitropical locations, in Africa, Madagascar, Asia, Australia, and Latin America, as well as various islands in the Pacific and in the Caribbean.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families A close relative is the genus Pouteria. Trees of this genus yield edible fruit, useful wood, and latex. The best-known species are M. bidentata (balatá), M. chicle (chicle) and M. zapota (sapodilla). M. hexandra is the floral emblem of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province in Thailand, where it is known as rayan. M. obovata shares the vernacular name of African pear with another completely different species, Dacryodes edulis, and neither should be confused with Baillonella toxisperma, known by the very similar name, African pearwood. The generic name, Manilkara, is derived from manil-kara, a vernacular name for M. kauki in Malayalam. Manilkara trees are often significant, or even dominant species in their native ecosystems, such as East Deccan dry evergreen forests, Central American premontane tropical wet forests, or together with Cynometra, in the Arabuko Sokoke National Park. Manilkara fruit are an important food item for various frugivores, in particular birds. The red fruit bat (Stenoderma rufum) is the primary - and possibly the only - seed disperser of M. bidentata in parts of the Caribbean. Tuckerella xiamenensis, a species of peacock mite, was described from a sapodilla tree. Several species are endangered due to overexploitation and habitat destruction. M. gonavensis of Haiti and M. spectabilis of Costa Rica are almost extinct. ==Selected species== These species are among those included in the genus Manilkara:M. obovata listed in Mabberley's The Plant Book and also at Encyclopedia of Life { - valign=top  Manilkara adolfo-friederici (Engl. & K.Krause) H.J.Lam Manilkara altissima (Engl.)

He was Professor of Architecture at University College London, a President of the Royal Academy, editor of Architects' Journal and founder of the Georgian Group. ==Life and work== Richardson was born in London. He trained in the offices of Leonard Stokes and Frank T. Verity, practitioners of the Beaux-Arts style, and in 1906 he established his first architectural practice, in partnership with Charles Lovett Gill (the Richardson & Gill partnership was eventually dissolved in 1939). He wrote several articles for Architectural Review and the survey of London Houses from 1660 to 1820: a Consideration of their Architecture and Detail (1911). In the following year he was appointed architect to the Prince of Wales's Duchy of Cornwall Estate. His massive work, Monumental Classic Architecture in Great Britain and Ireland (1914) established him as a scholar; in it he reappraised the Greek Revival architects C.R. Cockerell and Henri Labrouste. In his own work he was strongly influenced by nostalgia for the craftsmanship of the late Georgian era and the pared-down Neoclassicism of Sir John Soane in particular, but he recognised that his classical ideals needed to be developed to meet the challenges of Modernism. The result was a synthesis of traditional and modern approaches which was adapted and applied to industrial and commercial buildings, churches and houses. His deep knowledge of and sympathy towards Georgian design also helped him in numerous post-war commissions to restore bomb-damaged Georgian buildings. Ironically, several of his designs – most notably, Bracken House in the City of London, the first post-war London building to be listed and protected from redevelopment – are now regarded as classic milestones of 20th century design. He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1947 and was elected President of the Royal Academy in 1954; he was knighted in 1956. From 1957-1964 Richardson served as President of the Ealing Art Group. From 1919 until his death in 1964, Richardson lived at Avenue House, 20 Church Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, an 18th-century townhouse in which he initially refused to install electricity, believing that his home needed to reflect Georgian standards of living if he was truly to understand their way of life, though he was later persuaded to change his mind by his wife, Elizabeth Byers (March 1882 – 1958), whom he had married in 1904. They had one daughter. ==Projects== Manchester Opera House *Manchester Opera House (1912) *repairs to Ripon Cathedral, Ripon (1930s) *North London Collegiate School, Canons Park, Edgware, Middlesex *works on Baronscourt, Newtownstewart, Co Tyrone (1947) *restoration of St Malachy's (CoI) Parish Church, Hillsborough, County Down, Northern Ireland (1951–1956) *restoration of Navy Staircase (aka: Nelson Stair), Somerset House, following 1940 wartime bomb damage *restoration of St Alfege's Church, Greenwich, London (1953) *restoration of St James's Church, Piccadilly, London *restoration of Trinity House, City of London *church of St Stanislaus, Dulverton, Somerset (completed 1955) *bridge linking picture galleries, Anglesey Abbey, Cambridgeshire (1955) *restoration of the Wilkins Building, University College London (completed 1956) *church of St Cuthbert, Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire (1957) *housing in Ryculff Square and Fulthorpe Road, Blackheath, London (1954) *refurbishment of Sedbergh School library (1957–1958) *Financial Times building, Bracken House, Cannon Street, London (completed in 1958, in 1988 it became the first post-war listed building) *Tormore Distillery, Advie, Grantown on Spey, Morayshire, Scotland (1958–1960, also a listed building) *restoration of the Livery Hall of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, London (1959) *John White shoe factory, Rushden, Northamptonshire *repairs and improvements to The Old Rectory, Yardley Hastings, Northamptonshire *college chapel at St Mary's University College, Twickenham in Strawberry Hill (1962–1963) *restoration of Bath Assembly Rooms (completed 1963) *works at Elstow Abbey, Bedford *works at Harlington Manor (formerly Harlington House), Harlington, Bedfordshire *completion of St Martin's church, Knebworth, Hertfordshire (1963–1964, completing work begun by Sir Edwin Lutyens) * Mid Bedfordshire District Council Offices (formerly the Ampthill Rural District Council Offices, 12 Dunstable Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire (1963–1965) * model village layout, housing and community centre for London Brick Company at Stewartby, Bedfordshire, 1968 (first phase) and later, the last completed 1978 * Streetlights inspired by the Revo Festival design.

Lacedæmonian magistrates had the authorization to expel any person who posed a threat to public order and morals, for they considered their state a family writ large. While foreigners were allowed in for religious festivals and missions of state, they were generally not permitted to live in the environs, though special exceptions might be given to friends and allies, (laconophiles) like Xenophon. Xenophon himself wrote about xenelasia in his Constitution of the Spartans: > \\"There were alien acts in former days, and to live abroad was illegal; and I > have no doubt that the purpose of these regulations was to keep the citizens > from being demoralized by contact with foreigners; and now I have no doubt > that the fixed ambition of those who are thought to be first among them is > to live to their dying day as governors in a foreign land.\\" Thucydides wrote a speech attributed to Pericles in his History of the Peloponnesian War, which portrays xenelasia as a characteristic of Athens' enemies during the Peloponnesian War. These opponents included the Lacedæmonians: > \\"If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from antagonists. > We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts (ξενηλασίαις / > xenelasiais) exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or > observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our > liberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the native spirit of > our citizens...\\" Concerning xenelasia in Lacedæmonia, Plutarch wrote: Prof. Karl Otfried Müller writes that the Doric ideal of a \\"certain loftiness and severity of character\\" was preserved in Sparta only because it succeeded in keeping herself in an isolated situation. He argues these laws were intended to preserve the native character of the Doric tribe from any taint of foreign influence. However, Müller wrote in the context of a racial, mythographic view of history - they were the invading and occupying force in Lacedæmonia, holding down a population of servile peasants, called Helots, by iron military rule, and so, themselves, in the strict sense, xenoi. Niccolò Machiavelli believed that Sparta lasted a long time because \\"she did not permit strangers to establish themselves in the republic\\" and remarked that the Roman Republic took the opposite course of Sparta spelling her doom.The Prince, Niccolò Machiavelli, trans. & ed. by Robert M. Adams, W.W. Norton & Co., NY, 1992. pg 96 Machiavelli Balanced Government The population of Sparta was in decline from the time of its victory in the Peloponnesian Wars, falling from 9,000 Spartiates in 640 to 1,000 after the battle of Leuctra in 371, due to the refusal of miscegenation, selective infanticide and the desertion of patrician scions to more attractive foreign parts. The Roman polis, in addition, is the one society in the ancient world which most modeled itself on the Spartan military ethos. ===In Doric Crete=== In Plato's Laws, Clinias the Cretan remarks on Homer that \\"…we Cretans are not much given to cultivating verse of alien origin.\\"The Collected Dialogues of Plato, edited by Edith Hamilton and Huntington Cairns, Bollingen Series LXXI, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1961. The Laws, §680c; pg 1275. Because Doric Corcyreans were active, industrious and enterprising, good sailors and active merchants, they had entirely lost the stability and noble features of the Doric character. Some said that they exceeded the Athenians in degradation and that even their dogs excelled in impudence.The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race, Karl Otfried Müller, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 157. Argos was also a Doric state. It also lost its \\"noble features of the Doric character\\". \\"Argos became such an unsettled state of public affairs, sycophancy and violence became prevalent:…\\"The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race, Karl Otfried Müller, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 149. Tarentum was also a Doric state, a colony in Magna Graecia. \\"At a subsequent period, however, as there was no longer men of this stamp (noble character) to carry on the government, and the corruption of manners, caused by the natural fruitfulness of the country, and restrained by no strict laws, was continually on the increase, the state of Tarentum was so entirely changed, that every trace of the ancient Doric character, and particularly of the mother-country, disappeared; hence, although externally powerful and wealthy, it was from its real internal debility, in the end, necessarily overthrown, particularly when the insolent violence of the people became a fresh source of weakness.\\"The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race, Karl Otfried Müller, 2nd ed. rev. 1839. Vol II, pg 183 The brief admiration the Athenians and their allies may have had for Spartan Doric discipline and virtue born of cultural isolation, must be viewed in the context of their early alliance against the Persians, later to be turned to hatred and rebellion in the outcome of the Pelopennesian War and their loss of democracy and autonomy. But well before events turned the other city states against the dominant Sparta, Plato deploys the term Xenelasia as synonymous with barbarity, an entirely uncivilised condition. He has this to say in the Laws [XII, 950a-b]: \\"Not to welcome any visitor and never to go out [of your homeland] is, besides, something quite impossible and would, at the same time, be seen in the eyes of other men as a savage and unsocial form of behaviour. It would bring upon you the odious name of someone who hunts down foreigners (xenolasiais) and would earn you the reputation of having rough and brutal manners\\". op cit. == Notes == *\\"The anxiety of the Dorians, and the Spartans in particular, to keep up the pure Doric character and the customs of their ancestors, is strongly shown by the prohibition to travel, and the exclusion of foreigners, an institution common both to Spartans and Cretans,…\\"The History and Antiquities of the Doric Race, Karl Otfried Müller, trans. from the German by Henry Tufnell and George Cornewall Lewis, John Murray, London, 2nd ed. rev. 1839.

This conjectural model chariot incorporates a differential gear. The south-pointing chariot (or carriage) was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the south, no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, the pointer took the form of a doll or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was supposedly used as a compass for navigation and may also have had other purposes. The ancient Chinese invented a mobile-like armored cart in the 5th century BC called the Dongwu Che (). It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield. The Chinese war wagon was designed as a kind of mobile protective cart with a shed-like roof. It would serve to be rolled up to city fortifications to provide protection for sappers digging underneath to weaken a wall's foundation. The early Chinese war wagon became the basis of technologies for the making of ancient Chinese south-pointing chariots. There are legends of earlier south-pointing chariots, but the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200-265 CE) of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms. No ancient chariots still exist, but many extant ancient Chinese texts mention them, saying they were used intermittently until about 1300 CE. Some include information about their inner components and workings. There were probably several types of south- pointing chariot which worked differently. In most or all of them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a geared mechanism to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand at the start of a journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional dead reckoning, which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had differential gears, technology unseen since the ancient Greek Antikythera mechanism. ==Historical texts== ===Earliest sources=== An image of a south-pointing chariot from Sancai Tuhui (first published 1609) The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, wheeled vehicle used to discern the southern cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary Fu Xuan.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 40. The contemporary 3rd century AD source of the Weilüe, written by the East Han Dynasty politician Yuan Huan also described the south-pointing chariot of belonging to the Chinese mechanical engineer and politician Ma Jun. The Jin Dynasty (265-420 CE) era text of the Shu Zheng Ji (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern gatehouse of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city. However, the later written Song Shu (Book of Song) (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as creating the background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the Western Zhou Dynasty (1050-771 BCE). The book also provided a description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century AD text, translated by the British scientist and historian Joseph Needham, reads as follows (the south-pointing chariot is referred to as the south-pointing carriage): The last sentence of the passage is of great interest for navigation at sea, since the magnetic compass used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of Shen Kuo (1031-1095). Although the Song Shu text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287-288. In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the Gu Jin Zhu book of Cui Bao (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 288 Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the Shang Fang Gu Shi (Traditions of the Imperial Workshops), but the book was lost by his time. Children's instructive toy chariot in Chinese display at thumb ===Japan=== The invention of the south-pointing chariot also made its way to Japan by the 7th century. The Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan) of 720 AD described the earlier Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You constructing several south-pointing Chariots for Emperor Tenji of Japan in 658 CE.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 289. This was followed up by several more chariot devices built in 666 AD as well. ===Song Shi=== The south-pointing chariot was also combined with the earlier Han Dynasty era invention of the odometer (also Greco-Roman), a mechanical device used to measure distance traveled, and found in all modern automobiles. It was mentioned in the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) historical text of the Song Shi (compiled in 1345) that the engineers Yan Su (in 1027 CE) and Wu Deren (in 1107 CE) both created south-pointing chariots, which it details as follows.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291. (In Needham's translation, inches and feet (ft) are used as units of distance. 1 inch is 25.4 millimetres. 1 ft is 12 inches or 304.8 mm.) After this initial description of Yan Su's device, the text continues to describe the work of Wu Deren, who crafted a wheeled device that would combine the odometer and south-pointing chariot: == Chariots with differential gears == ===Background and explanation=== An illustration of a differential between the drive shaft (at bottom right) and driving wheels of an automobile There is a widely believed hypothesis that most, if not all, south-pointing chariots worked by means of differential gears. A differential is an assembly of gears, nowadays used in almost all automobiles except some electric and hybrid- electric ones, which has three shafts linking it to the external world. They are conveniently labelled A, B, and C. The gears cause the rotation speed of Shaft A to be proportional to the sum of the rotation speeds of Shafts B and C. There are no other limitations on the rotation speeds of the shafts. In an automobile, Shaft A is connected to the engine (through the transmission), and Shafts B and C are connected to two road wheels, one on each side of the vehicle. When the vehicle turns, the wheel going around the outside of the turning curve has to roll further and rotate faster than the wheel on the inside. The differential permits this to happen while both wheels are being driven by the engine. If the sum of the speeds of the wheels is constant, the speed of the engine does not change. In a south-pointing chariot, according to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional to the difference between the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot. The hypothesis that there were south-pointing chariots with differential gears originated in the 20th century. People who were familiar with modern (e.g. automotive) uses of differentials interpreted some of the ancient Chinese descriptions in ways that agreed with their own ideas. Essentially, they re-invented the south- pointing chariot, as it had previously been re-invented several times in antiquity. Working chariots that use differentials have been constructed in recent decades. Whether any such chariots existed previously is not known with certainty. Although the Antikythera mechanism is believed to have used differential gears, the first true differential gear definitely known to have been used was by Joseph Williamson in 1720.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 298. He used a differential for correcting the equation of time for a clock that displayed both mean and solar time. === Geometrical properties === If the south-pointing chariot were built perfectly accurately, using a differential gear, and if it travelled on an Earth that was perfectly smooth, it would have interesting properties. It would be a mechanical compass that transports a direction, given by the pointer, along the path it travels. Mathematically the device performs parallel transport along the path it travels. The chariot can be used to detect straight lines or geodesics. A path on a surface the chariot travels along is a geodesic if and only if the pointer does not rotate with respect to the base of the chariot. Because of the curvature of the Earth's surface (due to it being curved around as a globe), the chariot would generally not continue to point due south as it moves. For example, if the chariot moves along a geodesic (as approximated by any great circle) the pointer should instead stay at a fixed angle to the path. Also, if two chariots travel by different routes between the same starting and finishing points, their pointers, which were aimed in the same direction at the start, usually do not point in the same direction at the finish. Likewise, if a chariot goes around a closed loop, starting and finishing at the same point on the Earth's surface, its pointer generally does not aim in the same direction at the finish as it did at the start. The difference is the holonomy of the path, and is proportional to the enclosed area. If the journeys are short compared with the radius of the Earth, these discrepancies are small and may have no practical importance. Nevertheless, they show that this type of chariot, based on differential gears, would be an imperfect compass even if constructed exactly and used in ideal conditions. === Lack of precision, and implications === Real machines are never built perfectly accurately. Simple geometry shows that if the chariot's mechanism is based on a differential gear and if, for example, the width of the track of the chariot (the separation between its wheels) is three metres, and if the wheels are intended to be identical but actually differ in diameter by one part in a thousand, then if the chariot travels one kilometre in a straight line, the \\"south-pointing\\" figure will rotate nearly twenty degrees. If it initially points exactly to the south, at the end of the one-kilometre trip it will point almost to the south-southeast or south-southwest, depending on which wheel is the larger. If the chariot travels nine kilometres, the figure will end up pointing almost due north. Obviously, this would make it useless as a south-pointing compass. To be a useful navigational tool, the figure would have to rotate no more than a couple of degrees over a journey of a hundred kilometres, but this would require the chariot's wheels to be equal in diameter to within one part in a million. Even if the process of manufacturing the wheels were capable of this precision (which would not be possible with ancient Chinese methods), it is doubtful that the equality of the wheels could be maintained for long as they are subjected to the wear and tear of travelling across open country. Irregularity of the ground would add further errors to the device's functioning. Considerable scepticism is therefore warranted as to whether this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south- pointing doll was fixed to the body of the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll. If the real purposes of the chariot and the accounts of it were amusement and impressing visiting foreigners, rather than actual long- distance navigation, then its inaccuracy might not have been important. Considering that a large mechanical wagon or chariot would be obligated to travel on roads, the destination in question would typically not be in an unknown direction. The fact that the sources cited above mention that the chariot was placed at the front of processions, its high level of mechanical complexity and fragility, and that it was 'reinvented' several times contribute to the conclusion that it was not used for navigation, as a truly practical and useful navigational tool would not be forgotten or left unused. == Chariots without differential gears == Although the hypothesis that the south-pointing chariot used differential gears has gained wide acceptance, it should be recognized that functional south-pointing chariots without differential gears are possible. The ancient descriptions are often unclear, but they suggest that the Chinese implemented several different designs, at least some of which did not include differentials. === Mechanical designs === Some of the ancient descriptions suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might have been used to fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was on the outside of the curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear. The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren appear to have used this type of mechanism. (See descriptions quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned the space between the uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right. The description does not mention a third road wheel to fix the turning radius, but it is possible that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was an important part of the mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right. If a third road wheel was included, this type of south-pointing chariot could have worked quite accurately as a compass when used for short journeys under good conditions, but if used for long journeys it would have been subject to cumulative errors, like chariots using the differential mechanism. If in fact there was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so that one of the two wheels was stationary and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but there is no mention of one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track- width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed. The Song Shi description of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. The gear ratios would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled the diameter of the road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels. The gear ratios were appropriate for these dimensions. The charioteer would have had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the pointing doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He would have been able to adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot appear to work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation. Other mechanical designs for the south-pointing chariot are also possible, including ones that employ a device that is used today, the gyrocompass. However, there is no indication that the ancient Chinese knew of these. === Non-mechanical possibilities === Some south-pointing chariots may not have been purely mechanical devices. Someone riding inside the chariot may have used some non-mechanical method of determining the compass directions, and turned the doll on top of the chariot accordingly. There are several methods that could have been used, for example: * By using a magnetic compass. The Chinese were using this for navigation by the 11th century CE, when south-pointing chariots were still being made and used. * By using astronomical observations of the Sun and/or stars, e.g. the Pole Star. Chinese astronomical knowledge was extensive. * By using local knowledge. The person in the chariot may have known the area or had a map or description of it. * By observing the polarization of light from the sky. Vikings used birefringent crystals of Iceland spar to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method at about the same time. Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible. * By observing light that had been refracted by the Earth's atmosphere. This is one of the techniques that were used by Polynesian navigators to steer ships among Pacific islands. When the surface of the Earth, ocean or ground, is colder than the air above it, a dense layer of air is formed near the surface, which refracts light downward. The result is that light can go around the curvature of the Earth, allowing things to be seen at much greater distances than simple geometry would predict. The images are very distorted, but they can be recognized by skilled navigators. Certain other Polynesian techniques can also be used on land and may have been employed by the Chinese. Unlike mechanisms that rely on the rotation of road wheels, most of these methods can be used at sea. This may account for the mention (see \\"Earliest sources\\" above) that a marine version of the south-pointing chariot existed. These methods can work accurately over long distances, unlike the mechanical designs for the chariot. ==Necessity of non-mechanical orientation== South-pointing chariot replica at the Ibn Battuta Mall, Dubai Some non-mechanical method of finding the south must have been used when a mechanical south-pointing chariot was initialized, aiming its pointer to the south at the start of a journey. Any of the methods mentioned above in \\"Non-mechanical possibilities\\" could have been used. If any south-pointing chariot was really used for long-distance navigation, it must have relied (after initialization) on a non-mechanical direction-finding method. It might have been operated non-mechanically by someone riding in it, as outlined above. Alternatively, if it had a mechanical mechanism, it must have been frequently re-initialized non-mechanically to eliminate accumulated errors and uncertainties. The only chariots that might not have needed non- mechanical methods of finding the south would have been those that were never used for long-distance navigation. If some chariots were used only for amusement or fraud, they could have worked purely mechanically. Even initialization could have been avoided by simply declaring some arbitrary direction to be \\"south\\". == Where they can be seen == While none of the historic south-pointing chariots remain, full sized replicas can be found. The History Museum in Beijing, China, holds a replica based on the mechanism of Yen Su (1027). The National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, holds a replica based on the Lanchester mechanism of 1932. Referred to as the \\"southern pointing man\\", two replicas can also be seen (and physically experimented with) at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Canada. ==See also== * Chariots in ancient China * Chinese war wagon * History of science and technology in China * List of Chinese inventions * Mechanical engineering ==Notes== == References == *The Chinese South-Seeking chariot: A simple mechanical device for visualizing curvature and parallel transport M.

It is part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex which also contains the dark Horsehead and bright Orion nebulae. The loop takes the form of a large arc centered approximately on the Orion Nebula. The stars within the Orion Nebula are believed to be responsible for ionizing the loop. The loop extends over about 600 arcminutes as seen from Earth, covering much of Orion. It is well seen in long-exposure photographs, although observers under very dark skies may be able to see it with the naked eye. Recent estimates place it at a distance of either 159 pc (518 light years) or 440 pc (1434 ly) giving it dimensions of either about 100 or 300 ly across respectively. It is thought to have originated in a supernova explosion about 2 million years ago, which may have also created several known runaway stars, including AE Aurigae, Mu Columbae and 53 Arietis, which are believed to have been part of a multiple star system in which one component exploded as a supernova. Although this faint nebula was certainly observed by earlier astronomers, it is named after the pioneering astrophotographer E. E. Barnard who photographed it and published a description in 1894.

It is grown in large quantities in India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico. The name \\"zapota\\" from the Spanish zapote ultimately derives from the Nahuatl word tzapotl. ==Description== Sapodilla tree Sapodilla can grow to more than tall with an average trunk diameter of . The average height of cultivated specimens, however, is usually between with a trunk diameter not exceeding .Manilkara zapota Sapotaceae (L.) van Royen, Orwa C, Mutua A, Kindt R, Jamnadass R, Simons A. 2009.

The ornamental leaves are medium green and glossy. They are alternate, elliptic to ovate, long, with an entire margin. The white flowers are inconspicuous and bell-like, with a six-lobed corolla. An unripe fruit has a firm outer skin and when picked, releases white chicle from its stem. A fully ripened fruit has saggy skin and does not release chicle when picked. The fruit is a large berry, in diameter. Inside, its flesh ranges from a pale yellow to an earthy brown color with a grainy texture akin to that of a well- ripened pear. Each fruit contains one to six seeds. The seeds are hard, glossy, and black, resembling beans, with a hook at one end that can catch in the throat if swallowed. The fruit has an exceptionally sweet, malty flavor. The unripe fruit is hard to the touch and contains high amounts of saponin, which has astringent properties similar to tannin, drying out the mouth. The trees can survive only in warm, typically tropical environments, dying easily if the temperature drops below freezing. From germination, the sapodilla tree will usually take anywhere from five to eight years to bear fruit. The sapodilla trees yield fruit twice a year, though flowering may continue year round. ==Other names== Sapodilla fruits being sold on a street in Guntur, India. Sapodilla is known as mispel in the Virgin Islands and Dutch Caribbean; zapote in Honduras and Panama; níspero in Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guyana, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Colombia and Venezuela; dilly in the Bahamas; naseberry in Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean; sapoti in Brazil () and Haiti; chico in the Philippines and chicosapote or chicozapote in Guatemala, Mexico, Hawaii, and Florida.\\"Sapodilla Fruit Facts\\", California Rare Fruit Growers.

It is a spin-off of the Arthur TV series. The show stars Arthur's best friend, 8-year-old anthropomorphic rabbit Buster Baxter. Based by a backdoor pilot episode of Arthur entitled \\"Postcards from Buster\\", the television series was created by Cookie Jar Group (now known as DHX Media), WGBH Boston and Marc Brown Studios. The pilot was aired on December 22, 2003 as an episode of Arthur. The official series aired from October 11, 2004 to February 24, 2012, on PBS Kids and PBS Kids Go!. Buster's interests include eating anything, reading comic books, and playing video games. Buster's personality is that of a fairly intelligent and curious child. He also believes that extraterrestrials are real. Buster's parents are divorced; in this series, Buster is seen with his father, Bo Baxter. Arthur Read and many other characters from the PBS Kids animated television series Arthur make cameo appearances in this series, and most episodes have an Arthur character playing a minor role. The series went on hiatus between November 2008 and February 2012. ==Overview== Postcards from Buster centered on Buster traveling to different places around North America and worldwide, usually in the United States but also in the Caribbean, Canada and other places, with his father, who is a pilot for a band of musicians. In each episode, Buster meets children in the location, who show him views of their real-life families and global culture. The sequences with Buster are animated, while the portions featuring the children are live-action (viewed from the viewpoint of Buster's video camcorder). After each location, Buster sends to Arthur a \\"video postcard\\" video tape summarizing what he's done and who he's met in each location. The children and their families that appeared on the series are meant to be multicultural and diverse, and range from a Mormon family in Utah to a Mestizo family in Texas. ==Episodes== ==Voice actors and their characters== * Daniel Brochu – Buster Baxter * Ellen David – Bitzi Baxter * Marcel Jeannin – Bo Baxter * Elyzabeth Diaga (season 1) and Stephanie Martin (seasons 2–3) – Mora of Los Viajeros * Norman Groulx (season 1) and Glenn Coulson (seasons 2–3) – Carlos of Los Viajeros * Cameron Ansell (seasons 1–2) and Dallas Jokic (season 3) – Arthur Read * Jason Szwimmer (seasons 1–2) and Robert Naylor (season 3) – D.W.

This includes Buster's Outdoor Journeys (featuring episodes Sugartime, Meet Me at the Fair, The Giant Pumpkins and Bayou by Me), Buster's Got the Beat (featuring episodes Beats by the Bay, Buster and Beatrice, The Music Mystery and Buster's Sweet Song), Buster's Buddies (featuring episodes Buster's League of Champions, Best Friends, A Sense of Direction and Sleepy in Seattle) and Buster's World of Sports (featuring episodes Winter Gold, Swimming in the Desert, Rock and Roll and Rodeo Cowgirl). VHS releases, however, only include the first two episodes from the DVDs. On October 12, 2010, Mill Creek Entertainment released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1. For some unknown reason, the cover art for the DVD states that this is 'The complete series', when in fact it is not as there are 16 more episodes. ==Criticism and controversy== In January 2005, Margaret Spellings, United States Secretary of Education, revealed that the show had explored same-sex marriage. Episode #33, \\"Sugartime!\\", which features Buster visiting Hinesburg, Vermont, to learn about the production of maple sugar, includes Buster meeting several children who have lesbian parents. Vermont was one of the first states to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. In the episode, the word lesbian or homosexual is never said, and the episode — like all Postcards episodes — has no sexual content. Buster meets the children and comments, \\"Boy, that's a lot of moms!\\"; one girl mentions her \\"mom and stepmom,\\" adding that she loves her stepmother very much, and no other comments are made about the couple. PBS vice president of media relations Lea Sloan said at the time, \\"The fact that there is a family structure that is objectionable to the Department of Education is not at all the focus of the show, nor is it addressed in the show.\\" Spellings demanded that PBS return all federal funding that had been used in the production of the episode, claiming that \\"many parents would not want their young children exposed to the lifestyles portrayed in this episode.\\" PBS decided not to air this episode, but some member stations across the country chose to air the episode, including WNET in New York, KCET in Los Angeles, and KERA in Dallas–Fort Worth, which are flagship stations; and the show's co-producer, WGBH in Boston (which distributed the episode directly to public television stations after PBS's decision). It was, however, included in both the VHS and DVD version of the collection \\"Buster's Outdoor Journeys\\" which was distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment. Some of these stations opted to air this episode in prime- time, with some following the episode with a local discussion on the controversy. Shortly after the controversy, PBS's CEO announced she would step down when her contract expired in 2006. Cusi Cram, a writer for Arthur, later wrote a play titled Dusty and the Big Bad World, based on this controversy. ==References* Online NewsHour article covering the Sugartime! controversy Category:2000s American animated television series Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2004 American television series debuts Category:2012 American television series endings Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2010s Canadian animated television series Category:2004 Canadian television series debuts Category:2012 Canadian television series endings Category:PBS original programming Category:American animated television spin-offs Category:Canadian animated television spin-offs Category:Canadian children's animated adventure television series Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series Category:Canadian television shows based on children's books Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American television shows based on children's books Category:Television series by WGBH Category:Television series by Cookie Jar Entertainment Category:Television series produced in Ontario Category:Television series produced in Massachusetts Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television shows set in Chicago Category:PBS Kids shows Category:Arthur (TV series) Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Canadian animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American television series with live action and animation Category:Canadian television series with live action and animation Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about rabbits and hares ","title":"Postcards from Buster"},{"id":"1437801","text":"Willis Reed Jr. (born June 25, 1942) is an American retired basketball player, coach and general manager. He spent his entire professional playing career (1964–1974) with the New York Knicks. In 1982, Reed was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was voted one of the \\"50 Greatest Players in NBA History\\". After retiring as a player, Reed served as assistant and head coach with several teams for nearly a decade, then was promoted to general manager and vice president of basketball operations (1989–1996) for the New Jersey Nets. As senior vice president of basketball operations, he led them to the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003. ==Early life and education== Reed was born on June 25, 1942 in Dubach, Louisiana within Lincoln Parish. He grew up on a farm in nearby Bernice, Louisiana. His parents worked to ensure Reed got an education in the segregated South. Reed showed athletic ability at an early age and played basketball at West Side High School in Lillie, Louisiana. Reed attended Grambling State University, a historically black college. Playing for the Grambling State Tigers men's basketball team, Reed amassed 2,280 career points, averaging 26.6 points per game and 21.3 rebounds per game during his senior year. He led the Tigers to one NAIA title and three Southwestern Athletic Conference championships. Reed also became a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. ==Career== The New York Knicks selected Reed in the second round, with the eighth overall selection, in the 1964 NBA draft. Reed quickly made a name as a fierce, dominating and physical force on both ends of the floor. In March 1965, he scored 46 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, the second-highest single game total ever by the Knicks' rookie. For the 1964–65 season, he ranked seventh in the NBA in scoring (19.5 points per game) and fifth in rebounding (14.7 rebounds per game). He also began his string of All-Star appearances and won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award while also being named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Reed proved to be a clutch playoff performer throughout his career. He gave an early indication of this in the 1966–67 season when he improved his regular season averages to 20.9 points per game, and scoring 27.5 points per game in the postseason. He played center. Despite his relatively average stature for a basketball player, he made up for his lack of height by playing a physical game, often ending seasons with respectable averages in blocking and rebounding. He stood but like common practice was listed with shoes at 6'10, when contemporaries such as Wilt Chamberlain stood and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was in their playing careers. The team continued to struggle for a few years while adding good players through trades and the draft. Dick McGuire was replaced as coach with Red Holzman, midway through the 1967–68 season. The Knicks had gone 15–22 under McGuire; Holzman steered them to a 28–17 finish. In 1968, New York's record was 43–39, its first winning record since the 1958–59 season. Reed continued to make annual appearances in the NBA All-Star Game. By this time, he was playing power forward, in order to make room for Walt Bellamy. Reed averaged 11.6 rebounds in 1965–66 and 14.6 in 1966–67, both top 10 marks in the league. By the latter season, he had adjusted to the nuances of his new position, averaging 20.9 points to rank eighth in the NBA. In 1968–69, New York held opponents to a league-low 105.2 points per game. With Reed clogging the middle and Walt Frazier pressuring the ball, the Knicks would be the best defensive club in the league for five of the next six seasons. Reed scored 21.1 points per game in 1968–69 and grabbed a franchise record 1,191 rebounds, an average of 14.5 rebounds per game. ===First championship=== In the 1969–70 season, the Knicks won a franchise record 60 games and set a then single season NBA record with an 18-game win streak. In 1970, Reed became the first player in NBA history to be named the NBA All-Star Game MVP, the NBA regular season MVP, and the NBA Finals MVP in the same season. That same year, he was named to the All-NBA First Team and NBA All-Defensive First Team, as well as being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, and the Sporting News NBA MVP. Reed's most famous performance took place on May 8, 1970, during game seven of the 1970 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers in Madison Square Garden. Due to a severe thigh injury, a torn muscle that had previously kept him out of game six, he was considered unlikely to play in game seven. However, Reed surprised the fans by walking onto the court during warmups, prompting widespread applause. Starting the game, he scored the Knicks' first two field goals on his first two shot attempts, his only points of the game. Following the game in the winner's locker room, a moved Howard Cosell told Reed on national television, \\"You exemplify the very best that the human spirit can offer.\\"Greatest Finals Moments, NBA.com, accessed February 9, 2008. ===Second championship=== The Knicks slipped to a 52–30 record in the 1970–71 season, still good enough for first place in the Atlantic Division; and in mid-season, Reed tied Harry Gallatin's all-time club record by grabbing 33 rebounds against the Cincinnati Royals. Once again, Reed started in the All-Star Game. For the season, he averaged 20.9 points and 13.7 rebounds per game, but the Knicks were eliminated by the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1971–72, Reed was bothered by tendinitis in his left knee, limiting his mobility. He missed two weeks early in the season and returned, but shortly thereafter the injured knee prohibited him from playing, and he totaled 11 games for the year. Without Reed, the Knicks still managed to make the NBA Finals, but were defeated in five games by the Los Angeles Lakers. The 1972–73 Knicks finished the season with a 57–25 record and went on to win another NBA title. Reed was less of a contributor than he was two seasons earlier. In 69 regular season games, he averaged only 11.0 points. In the playoffs, the Knicks beat the Bullets and upset the Boston Celtics, and again faced the Lakers in the NBA Finals. After losing the first game, the Knicks captured four straight, claiming their second NBA championship with a 102–93 victory in game five. Reed was named NBA Finals MVP. Reed's career was cut short by injuries, and he retired after the 1973–74 season. For his career, Reed averaged 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, playing 650 games. He played in seven All-Star Games. ==Post-playing career== Reed spent several years coaching before moving into general management. He coached the Knicks in 1977–1978, and left the team 14 games into the following season (49–47 record). He was the head coach at Creighton University from 1981 to 1985 and volunteer assistant coach for St. John's University. Reed also served as an assistant coach for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings. Reed debuted as head coach of the New Jersey Nets on March 1, 1988, one week after the Nets' star forward (and Reed's cousin) Orlando Woolridge was suspended by the league and was to undergo drug rehabilitation. He compiled a 33–77 record with the Nets. In 1989, he was hired as the Nets' general manager and vice president of basketball operations (1989–1996). During this time, he drafted Derrick Coleman and Kenny Anderson, acquired Dražen Petrović, and made the Nets a playoff contender throughout the early 1990s. Reed hired Chuck Daly to coach the Nets for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. In 1996, Reed moved to the position of senior vice president of basketball operations, with the continued goal of building the Nets into a championship contender. The Nets made the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003. Reed next took the position of vice president of basketball operations with the New Orleans Hornets in 2004.

Examples include Kurtis Blow's 1984 hit \\"Basketball\\" on his Ego Trip album, and the Beastie Boys' \\"Long Burn The Fire\\" on their 2011 album Hot Sauce Committee Part Two. Reed's name has become synonymous with playing through injury, as Cris Collinsworth described an injured Aaron Rodgers as having a \\"Willis Reed kind of night\\" on the NBC Sunday Night Football broadcast on September 9, 2018. ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  80  —  38.0  .432  —  .742  14.7  1.7  —  —  19.5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  76  —  33.4  .434  —  .757  11.6  1.2  —  —  15.5 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  78  —  36.2  .489  —  .735  14.6  1.6  —  —  20.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  81  —  35.5  .490  —  .721  13.2  2.0  —  —  20.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"New York  82  —  37.9  .521  —  .747  14.5  2.3  —  —  21.1 -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#afe6ba;\\"†  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  81  —  38.1  .507  —  .756  13.9  2.0  —  —  21.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"New York  73  —  39.1  .462  —  .785  13.7  2.0  —  —  20.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  11  —  33.0  .438  —  .692  8.7  2.0  —  —  13.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#afe6ba;\\"†  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"New York  69  —  27.2  .474  —  .742  8.6  1.8  —  —  11.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  19  —  26.3  .457  —  .792  7.4  1.6  0.6  1.1  11.1 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Career  650  —  35.5  .476  —  .747  12.9  1.8  0.6  1.1  18.7 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"All-Star  7  4  23.0  .452  —  .750  8.3  1.0  —  —  12.6 ===Playoffs=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"1967  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  4  —  37.0  .538  —  .960  13.8  1.8  —  —  27.5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"1968  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  6  —  35.0  .541  —  .733  10.3  1.8  —  —  21.3 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"1969  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  10  —  42.9  .510  —  .786  14.1  1.9  —  —  25.7 -  style=\\"text- align:left; background:#afe6ba;\\"1970†  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  18  —  40.7  .471  —  .737  13.8  2.8  —  —  23.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"1971  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  12  —  42.0  .413  —  .667  12.0  2.3  —  —  15.7 -  style=\\"text- align:left;background:#afe6ba;\\"1973†  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  17  —  28.6  .466  —  .857  7.6  1.8  —  —  12.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"1974  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"New York  11  —  12.0  .378  —  .600  2.0  0.4  0.2  0.0  3.4 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Career  78  —  33.9  .474  —  .765  10.3  1.9  0.2  0.0  17.4 ==References== ;Footnotes ;Bibliogprahy * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Profile at Basketball Hall of Fame * Summary at NBA.com Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball coaches Category:African-American basketball players Category:African-American sports executives and administrators Category:American men's basketball players Category:American sports executives and administrators Category:Atlanta Hawks assistant coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Louisiana Category:Basketball players at the 1963 Pan American Games Category:Basketball players from Louisiana Category:Centers (basketball) Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Creighton Bluejays men's basketball coaches Category:Grambling State Tigers men's basketball players Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Category:National Basketball Association All-Stars Category:National Basketball Association players with retired numbers Category:National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Category:New Jersey Nets executives Category:New Jersey Nets head coaches Category:New Orleans Hornets executives Category:New York Knicks draft picks Category:New York Knicks head coaches Category:New York Knicks players Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in basketball Category:People from Dubach, Louisiana Category:People from Bernice, Louisiana Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Sacramento Kings assistant coaches Category:St. John's Red Storm men's basketball coaches Category:United States men's national basketball team players ","title":"Willis Reed"},{"id":"1437805","text":"Alan Cox (born June 23, 1971) is an American radio/TV personality. Cox is currently the afternoon host on 100.7 WMMS in Cleveland, Ohio. He is also a frequent guest host for the nationally syndicated \\"America Now\\" show. Prior to Cleveland & Detroit, Cox was on the air at the former WKQX (Q101), in Chicago & WXDX-FM in Pittsburgh, PA. Cox began his career on stations in Rockford, Illinois and Kalamazoo, Michigan.Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more! . FMQB. Retrieved on April 13, 2012.Radio Note: Cox lands in Chicago. Post-gazette.com (2006-09-02). Retrieved on April 13, 2012.Alan Cox let go from WXDX-FM. Post-gazette.com (2006-06-27). Retrieved on April 13, 2012. Cox is known for literate, polite and caustic stream-of-consciousness commentary, left-leaning political views, and absurdist comedy routines. Contrary to conventional wisdom among radio personalities, Cox had been successful despite divulging very little about his personal life. Since debuting the show in Cleveland, he has become much more candid, regularly discussing various aspects of his personal life. ==Early career== Alan Cox grew up in Loves Park, IL- much closer to Wisconsin than Chicago, though Cox has worked to build a narrative about “being from Chicago”. It is accurate to say that Alan Cox began writing and performing stand-up comedy around Chicago during college in the early 1990s. A classmate in a public speaking class at Northwestern University recommended Cox try his hand at radio, and he was briefly on the air at his college station. A chance meeting with an outgoing intern at WLUP-FM (\\"The Loop\\") in Chicago led to Cox filling the position for the Jonathon Brandmeier Radio Showgram, one of the most successful shows in Chicago radio history. Cox's intelligence, humor, and willingness to do a variety of on-air stunts for the show led to his hiring as a producer. After two years, Cox left The Loop to begin his own radio show. In September 1995, he was hired to do nights at WRKR-FM in Kalamazoo, MI. His irreverent comedy and outspoken style made the show an instant hit in the college town, and he was promoted to afternoon drive one year later. ==105.9 WXDX-FM Pittsburgh== In December 1998, Cox was hired to fill the afternoon drive slot at WXDX-FM (105.9 The X) in Pittsburgh, one of the country's most prominent and highly rated alternative stations. The Alan Cox Radio Show debuted to mixed reviews, but after a year, his quick wit, unfiltered opinions, and verbal sparring with listeners on a wide array of topics made Cox one of the most popular personalities in the market. He began writing columns for local newspapers and magazines, as well as being hired by the NHL to be the arena host for the Pittsburgh Penguins. After his first year on WXDX, Cox was hired by Pittsburgh's PBS affiliate WQED to provide a young, liberal face and voice for a new weekly panel segment on a newsmagazine show called On Q. The segment, which placed Cox onstage with local conservative host Fred Honsberger, radio host Lynn Cullen, and think-tank advisor Jerry Bowyer became so popular that it was spun off into a separate show called Off Q. The show provided the perfect complement to Cox's radio show and his visibility in the market grew dramatically, as it introduced his intelligence and humor to an older audience unfamiliar with his work on WXDX. In June 2004, The Alan Cox Radio Show was moved to mornings after WXDX's parent company, Clear Channel, dropped The Howard Stern Show for content issues. While Cox's show took some time to reboot for a new audience, his popularity provided an easier transition than most stations losing Stern. Cox also returned to his stand-up comedy roots by hosting open mic nights at area clubs and frequently worked new material for live audiences. In June 2006, Cox was informed by WXDX management that his contract would not be renewed. Despite solid ratings and an extremely loyal audience, speculation was that Clear Channel Communications simply wouldn't justify Cox's increasingly lucrative contract and dumped the show in a cost-cutting move. ==Q101 Chicago== In August 2006, Cox was hired to return to Chicago as the host of The Morning Fix, a new conceptual ensemble show at heritage alternative WKQX-FM (Q101). (Ironically, this put Cox down the hall from his former mentor Brandmeier, who returned to host mornings at sister station WLUP after the station was purchased by Emmis in 2005.) The Morning Fix combined the sensibilities of improv and stand-up comedy with traditional radio elements and replaced the outgoing Mancow Muller, who had been Q101's morning host for nearly a decade. In November 2007, after 14 months of turbulence, the ensemble members of the Morning Fix were let go, due to the show's high cost and insufficient ratings. Cox and sports anchor Jim Lynam were asked to stay and create a more music-intensive show. The new show was a more conversational and caller-intensive incarnation of the former show, and more reminiscent of Cox's solo show. On August 1, 2008, Cox & Lynam's \\"Morning Fix\\" was canceled. They were replaced temporarily by Q101 weekend DJ Alex Quigley until August 11, 2008, when Q101's former late afternoon duo Sherman and Tingle took over the WKQX morning duties. Ironically, the ratings at the time of their dismissal placed Cox and Lynam in the top 5 rankings, leading some to speculate that the change was financially motivated, due to Emmis's sagging stock price coinciding with the end of Cox's expensive contract. Unwilling to leave Chicago, Cox briefly took a job working in the ad sales department of Clear Channel Chicago's smooth jazz station, WNUA 95.5 until January 20, 2009 when he was one of 1,800 employees the media giant laid off nationwide. He continued to perform standup comedy around Chicago and worked two seasons with the WNBA as the arena host for the Chicago Sky. ==100.7 WMMS Cleveland== On December 16, 2009, The Alan Cox Show premiered in the afternoon slot on 100.7 WMMS/Cleveland, replacing Maxwell (Ben Borstein) of The Maxwell Show after contract negotiations fell through between Bornstein and the station. (Coincidentally, Cox and Bornstein nearly worked alongside each other at WXDX-FM in Pittsburgh ten years earlier.) The show airs weekdays from 2-6p EST and is heard live online at www.alancoxshow.com. Cox is joined by comedians Bill Squire, Mary Santora, and phone screener Cody \\"Poundcake\\" Brown. Comedian Chad Zumock was co-host of The Alan Cox Show from early 2010 to late 2012; on December 3, 2012, it was announced that he was no longer with WMMS after being arrested for driving while intoxicated. However, on May 3, 2013, Cleveland Scene reported that Zumock had been acquitted of the charge. While at WMMS, Alan has been featured in both Talkers (ranked 74th in the publication's 2012 \\"Heavy Hundred Talk Hosts\\") and as a cover story for the June 2011 issue of Cleveland Magazine.http://www.talkers.com/2012/05/10/alan- cox-talk-show-rocks-cleveland-on-wmms-fm/ ==100.3 WSDD & WSGX St. Louis== In April 2010, Cox was added as a voice-tracked midday host at 100.3 WSDD St. Louis. The show was recorded live from the WMMS studios and aired weekdays from 10a-4p CST and online at www.soundstl.com. On December 26, 2010, The Sound flipped format to \\"Gen-X Radio\\" (and callsign to WSGX) and began playing music only. Cox returned to the station in the same timeslot on February 28, 2011. The station flipped format again in May 2012 to the classic rock format, \\"100.3 The Brew\\". ==106.7 WDTW Detroit== On November 5, 2012, Cox announced an agreement between him and WMMS owner iHeartMedia to host mornings at classic rock station WDTW-FM/Detroit. Cox hosted the Detroit show from WMMS through voice-tracking, but also said he would occasionally host both shows from WDTW- FM. Cox was under contract with WDTW & WMMS through 2017. He also served as fill-in host for the nationally syndicated America Now show. ==References== == External links == * Category:Radio personalities from Chicago Category:1971 births Category:Living people ","title":"Alan Cox (radio personality)"},{"id":"1437810","text":"Inter vivos (Latin, between the living) is a legal term referring to a transfer or gift made during one's lifetime, as opposed to a testamentary transfer (a gift that takes effect on death) under the subject of trust.

The acquisition was completed in March 2008, for $850 million. Godiva continues to own and operate more than 450 shops worldwide. The company issues six seasonal mail-order catalogs a year in the US and also accepts online and telephone orders for their products. Godiva chocolate is also sold in local malls and mini shops. Godiva opened (May 2012) Café Godiva in London's Harrods department store. The 40-plus table venue features Godiva's chocolate beverages, pastries, and chocolates. The company also has a store in the Harrods Food Hall. Godiva is a participating member of the World Cocoa Foundation and Cocoa Horizons Foundation. The company is a partner of Save the Children, and began The Lady Godiva Program which partnered with FEED Projects in its first year. In 2016, Godiva celebrated its 90th anniversary and opened its 100th store in China. In 2017, the business opened its first store in Australia, inaugurated its Pierre Draps Chocolate Research & Development Centre in Brussels, and opened its North America flagship store in Rockefeller Center. In 2018, Godiva opened its first café in Brussels, the birthplace of the brand. In February 2018, Godiva took out a full-page ad in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial newspaper, suggesting the retirement of the giri choco practice. In Japan, as part of the giri choco practice, women are expected to buy chocolate for their colleagues, friends, bosses and sometimes family members on Valentine's Day. The public's reaction to the ad was generally seen as favorable. Godiva has been involved in the controversy over chocolate manufactures use of child labor in the production of chocolate. == Locations == In 2016, Godiva had approximately 650 retail stores throughout the world. Godiva's global presence increased rapidly, especially in countries like China and Japan. Godiva has two factories, one in Brussels, and another in Reading, Pennsylvania, US. == Legal disputes == Lawyers of the company have sent a series of letters warning the Lady Godiva public house in Geneva, Switzerland, that they are infringing upon their intellectual property, with the latest asking them to cease and desist from using the name. Pru Porretta, MBE, who was behind the revival of Dame Goodyver's Daye in Coventry, England, where a procession through the city's streets includes her representing Lady Godiva riding a horse commented \\"I think it's very sad. Godiva was a great woman who challenged her husband to stop the terrible things that were happening to the people.

He also went by the name of Chevalier de Louville (Knight of Louville). ==Biography== Louville's father (1628–1707) was the lord of Louville. His mother (1646–1704) was born a Vaultier de Moyencourt. His older brother named Charles Auguste was known for his role with Philip V of Spain and was a member of the family who had a higher social rank. ==Early life== Being the youngest son, Jacques Louville was destined to the church (the other choices were a military career or another path which would not offend his elders) We know in his youth two remarkable things happened: *When he was questioned about the tonsure at age 7, he attended the ceremony and firmly declared that he would not be ecclesiastic. *At the age of 12, he read Les Elements d'Euclid translated by Dennis Henrion without a guide and this was a turning point for him in his life. ==Military career== Louville was the youngest in the French Royal Navy. He fought in the Battle of La Hougue in 1692. He became an army captain at the end of 1700. His older brother Charles Auguste who served with Philip V, brought him there. He was nominated to be a brigadier and his services were recognised with a pension. When he returned to France, he resumed his service. He became a prisoner of war in 1708 at the Battle of Oudenarde and was held for two years. Once he was released he became Colonel of the Dragons of The Queen army and was paid by the king. He later found peace in returning to the study of astronomy. He cut the ties with the army and against the wishes of his family, he returned his officer certificate and renounced his appointments. ==Scientific career== He devoted his time to mathematics and the principle of astronomy. Louville went to Marseille in 1713 or 1714, to measure the height of the pole needed to properly tie his observations of the stars to the observations of Pythéas (a Greek astronomer and explorer), made 2000 years ago. In 1715 Louville went to London to observe a total solar eclipse assisting Edmund Halley in the remarkable phenomenon. The men saw on the dark surface of the moon jets of light that lasted for an instant and passed. They resembled flashes (fulminations). In 1717 he situated himself in Carré a mile from Orléans. He had been a member of the Academy of Sciences since 1714 and the Academy had a residency obligation. The situation was not a regular occurrence. But Louville promised to communicate to the school annually, kept his promise and continued to study the sky in Oréans. ==Personality== Fontenelle who did not fail to make the connection with the child refusing the tonsure, was an independent minded man, nor misanthrope, nor austere, but generous with his time. If one arrived early for dinner he did not mind, he read a book from his library or he would take a walk. “He was a perfect stoic and kept to himself, and didn't show anything on the outside; good friend however, unofficial, generous, but those kind on the outside often compensate for the most part. Or at least are very forward. He was very taciturn, even when there was a question on mathematics and he spoke, it was not to parade his knowledge, but to communicate to those the serious matter. The scholar who speaks only to instruct others, and as far as they want to be educated is a grace; Instead of speaking to flaunt knowledge, It can be amazing if one listens.\\" (Fontonelle) ==Contributions== Louville concluded in his measurements taken during his stay in Marseille ( watching the same stars that Pythéas had observed in the same city five centuries ago and those of other astronomers for century's had also observed) that the tilt on the axis of earth was not constant all the time. Voltaire was the witness after the other enlargement of time scales given by the work of Louville. \\"This astronomer in 1714 went to Marseille to observe the eclipse as it had been set by Pythéas approximately 2000 years before ; he found in less than 20 minutes , it is to say in 2000 years, the eclipse, according to him it was approaching the equator by 3 degrees ( its assumed). Besides the movements he knew the sun would have another movement where it would turn on itself from one pole to another. This finding showed that in 23000 years the sun will be directed towards the equator and that in 2 million years all the climates around the world under the torrid zones and under the glacier zones will change” (Voltaire) Louvilles thesis explained mathematically by Euler, and accepted today, had a considerable echo but he was still challenged by other scientists. The Hire and Riccioli were reluctant. The observations from ancient Greeks, Arab-Muslim, ancient Chinese and the west search to add ideas. The crater Louville on the Moon is named after him. ==References== * 1732\\\\. Académie des Sciences.

A collector of antiques, he donated his vast collection to the city of Glasgow, leading to the creation of the Burrell Collection art museum. ==Biography== His sister, Mary Born on 9 July 1861 in Glasgow, Burrell was the third of nine children to shipowner William Burrell (1832–1885) and Isabella Duncan (née Guthrie). Burrell's grandfather, George Burrell, had founded a shipping firm; Burrell joined this business in 1875, at the age of 14, and took over the firm when his father died. Burrell and his brothers were successful in business by ordering ships during economic downturns, and using these modern vessels to full capacity when the economy recovered. Using this method the family became rich. This allowed Burrell to spend his time collecting antiques, and he managed this by his eye for a bargain. Burrell was a faithful patron of Scottish artists including Joseph Crawhall II, George Henry and John Lavery. He commissioned Lavery to paint a portrait of his sister Mary Burrell in 1896. This portrait was exhibited widely and is considered one of Lavery's finest works.Lavery, John (1940) \\"The Life of a Painter\\" Boston: Little Brown In 1944 Burrell donated his collection to the city of Glasgow, with £250,000 to house it. The conditions of this include the request that the collection should be in a rural setting. This posed a problem until the council acquired Pollok Country Park. A custom- built museum, the Burrell Collection, was finally opened in 1983 – even this is large enough to display only a portion of Burrell's collection. Provand's Lordship in Glasgow also displays some of his collection of 17th century Scottish furniture. ==Freemasonry== Burrell was a Scottish Freemason, initiated in Lodge \\"The Princes's\\", No.607, on 9 May, Passed on 7 November 1892 and Raised on 12 March 1893.Famous Scottish Freemasons. The Grand Lodge of Antient Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland. 2010. P.35-36. ==Death== William Burrell died at Hutton Castle in the Scottish Borders on 29 March 1958, at the age of 96. He is buried in Largs, where he had a holiday home in Nelson Street, along with his wife Constance who died on 15 August 1961 aged 86. ==Awards and honours== Burrell was knighted in 1927 for services to art and for his public work. The Freedom of the City of Glasgow was conferred upon him on 26 May 1944. He was the recipient of the 1946 St Mungo Prize, awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow. ==Family== In 1901 Burrell married Constance Mary Lockhart Mitchell, the daughter of another ship owner. Constance suffered from poor health, and ended her life mentally unwell. They had a daughter, Marion (1902–1992); Constance resented the difficult labour she had experienced, and Sir William—devoted to his wife, and encouraged by her to treat Marion harshly—found his daughter's suitors wanting, breaking three of her engagements.

New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, p. 543. ==Process== Carl Cori and Gerty Cori jointly won the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, not for their discovery of the Cori cycle but for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen. Muscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown of glycogen in the skeletal muscles. The breakdown of glycogen, known as glycogenolysis, releases glucose in the form of glucose 1-phosphate (G1P). The G1P is converted to G6P by phosphoglucomutase. G6P is readily fed into glycolysis, (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G6P concentration is high) a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of oxygen is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate, one product of glycolysis, into the citric acid cycle. When oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism. Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Most importantly, fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining its concentration so additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate. (Refer to the main articles on glycolysis and fermentation for the details.) Instead of accumulating inside the muscle cells, lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the liver. This initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis.\\"Cori Cycle \\". Retrieved May 3, 2008, from Elmhurst, pp. 1–3. Overall, the glycolysis steps of the cycle produce 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis steps. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules in the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver. ==Significance== The cycle's importance is based on the prevention of lactic acidosis in the muscle under anaerobic conditions. However, normally, before this happens, the lactic acid is moved out of the muscles and into the liver. The cycle is also important in producing ATP, an energy source, during muscle activity. The Cori cycle functions more efficiently when muscle activity has ceased. This allows the oxygen debt to be repaid such that the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain can produce energy at peak efficiency. The Cori cycle is a much more important source of substrate for gluconeogenesis than food. The contribution of Cori cycle lactate to overall glucose production increases with fasting duration before plateauing. Specifically, after 12, 20, and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers, gluconeogenesis accounts for 41%, 71%, and 92% of glucose production, but the contribution of Cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis is 18%, 35%, and 36%, respectively. The remaining glucose production comes from protein breakdown, muscle glycogen, and glycerol from lipolysis. The drug metformin can cause lactic acidosis in patients with kidney failure because metformin inhibits the hepatic gluconeogenesis of the Cori cycle, particularly the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1.Vecchio, S. et al. \\"Metformin accumulation: lactic acidosis and high plasmatic metformin levels in a retrospective case series of 66 patients on chronic therapy.\\", Clin Toxicol. 2014;52(2). The buildup of lactate and its substrates for lactate production, pyruvate and alanine, lead to excess lactate.Sirtori CR, Pasik C. \\"Re-evaluation of a biguanide, metformin: mechanism of action and tolerability\\". Pharmacol Res 1994; 30. Normally, the excess lactate would be cleared by the kidneys, but in patients with kidney failure, the kidneys cannot handle the excess lactic acid. ==See also== *Alanine cycle *Citric acid cycle ==References== ==Sources== *Smith, A.D., Datta, S.P., Smith, G.

Published in 1971, it was followed up seven years later by War and Remembrance; originally conceived as one volume, Wouk decided to break it into two when he realized it took nearly 1000 pages just to get to the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1983, it became a highly successful miniseries The Winds of War on the ABC television network. In 2020, a new miniseries adaptation was announced to be co-written by Seth MacFarlane as his first project with NBCUniversal. ==Overview== The novel features a mixture of real and fictional characters that are all connected to the extended family of Victor \\"Pug\\" Henry, a fictional middle-aged Naval Officer and confidant of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The story arc begins six months before Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939 and ends shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, when the United States and, by extension, the Henry family, enters the war as well. Wouk interspersed the narrative text with epistolic \\"excerpts\\" taken from a book written by one of the book's fictional characters, German general Armin von Roon, while he was in prison for war crimes. Victor Henry translates the volume in 1965 after coming across Von Roon's German version. While the texts provide the reader with a German outlook on the war, Henry occasionally inserts notes as counterpoints to some of von Roon's statements. ==Plot== In 1939 Navy Commander Victor \\"Pug\\" Henry has been appointed US Naval attaché in Berlin. During the voyage to Europe aboard , Victor befriends a British radio personality, Alistair Talcott \\"Talky\\" Tudsbury, his daughter, Pamela, and a German submarine officer, Captain Grobke. In the television version, he also meets German General Armin von Roon. In the book he only meets Von Roon later at a Berlin dinner party. Von Roon becomes the viewpoint character for the German side of the war and witnesses the German government's worsening persecution of the Jews. Pug quickly recognizes—through his work as the attaché—that Nazi Germany is intent on invading Poland. Realizing that this would mean war with the Soviet Union, he concludes that the only way for Germany to safely invade is to agree not to go to war with the Soviets. Pug submits a report back to Washington—going over his supervisor's head—which predicts the Nazi–Soviet non-aggression pact before it is signed. When the pact is made public, Pug's report draws him to the attention of President Roosevelt, who asks the Navy Commander to be his unofficial eyes and ears in Europe. Although this new assignment again delays his desired sea command, it gives him the opportunity to travel to London, Rome, and Moscow where he meets Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin in addition to Adolf Hitler, whom he met in Berlin. Due to Pug's increasing amount of travel and his aversion to many of the cultural events which are enjoyed by his wife, Rhoda, she spends increasing amounts of time alone. Through Pug, she meets a widowed engineer named Palmer (Fred) Kirby, who later will be involved in the first phase of the Manhattan Project. Rhoda and Palmer begin to spend time together attending the opera and other events, but soon this leads to a romantic relationship. For his part, Pug begins a platonic but very close and borderline romantic relationship with Pamela; however, he cannot decide to leave his wife Rhoda for her. After having finally obtained command of a battleship, , he leaves for Pearl Harbor from Moscow, where he has discussed Lend-Lease issues and observed a battle. He flies over Asia and spends time in Manila listening to the radio broadcast of the annual Army–Navy football game. When his flight is approaching Pearl Harbor, they receive the message that an attack is under way. Arriving at the base, they see the burning ships, including his own. Pug's three children each have their own story lines. His older son, Warren, is a United States Naval Academy graduate who enters Navy Flight School in Florida. His daughter, Madeline, begins a job in a radio company. The child most prominent in the story is middle child and younger son Byron, named after Lord Byron, the English poet. Though a Columbia University graduate and holding a naval reserve commission, Byron has not committed himself to a career. In 1939 he accepts a job as a research assistant for an expatriate Jewish author, Aaron Jastrow, who is best known for his book A Jew's Jesus and lives in Siena, Italy. Byron also meets Jastrow's niece, Natalie, and her soon-to-be fiancé, Leslie Slote, who works for the Department of State. Readers later discover that Natalie and Slote are also close friends of Pamela Tudsbury from their time in Paris together. Byron is three years younger than Natalie, but catches her attention by heroically saving her uncle from being trampled by a stampeding horse during the Palio, a festival in Siena. Byron and Natalie visit her family's native town in Poland, Medzice, for a wedding, which occurs the night prior to the German invasion of Poland. They are awakened early the next morning to evacuate as the town citizens flee from the invaders. They travel from Medzice to Warsaw ahead of the invading German army, and at one point the refugees are strafed by the Luftwaffe and many are killed and injured. As they approach Warsaw, they encounter Polish soldiers who confiscate Byron's passport and attempt to commandeer their automobile and leave them stranded. Finally, they are in Warsaw as the Germans begin the siege and are evacuated along with other Americans and citizens of neutral countries. During their encounters with the German and Polish soldiers, Byron repeatedly behaves heroically. Leslie behaves in cowardly fashion under artillery fire, but stands up to the Germans when they attempt to separate Jewish Americans from their group. When Natalie receives the proposal of marriage from Leslie that she has been eagerly awaiting, she realizes that the experience in Poland has changed her heart and that she is now in love with Byron. After much beating around the bush, she admits this to Byron, who promptly offers his own proposal of marriage, which Natalie accepts. She returns to America upon receiving word that her father is quite ill, and she is also able to attend Warren's wedding. Her father dies of a heart attack upon hearing of the invasion of Norway and Denmark on April 9, 1940. In January 1941, she marries Byron and devotes herself to getting her reluctant uncle out of Europe to escape the Nazis, soon discovering she is pregnant. All of the story lines are left as a cliffhanger as the United States is drawn into the war by the attack on Pearl Harbor. Rhoda makes and then retracts a request for a divorce. With USS California damaged and out of action, Pug is given command of a cruiser, . Byron has been trained as a submarine officer. Warren has graduated from Pensacola, married a Congressman's daughter, Janice Lacouture, and is assigned to as a dive bomber pilot. Aaron, Natalie, and Natalie's infant son Louis are trapped in Europe as the war begins. These storylines continue in War and Remembrance. ==Author's viewpoint and focus== Wouk never presumes to read the minds of historical characters; only fictional characters have thoughts the reader can share in this novel. Wouk wrote that the novel was a traditional and linear narrative of the war that began with the cataclysmic event of Pearl Harbor, \\"where we entered the ordeal that ended with our martial triumph, our temporary nuclear supremacy, and our global leadership that has since became our unwanted glory and our leaden burden. In The Winds of War, I have tried to evoke the whole historic-that is linear drift to that shattering moment\\".Wouk, Herman, \\"Wouk Discusses Historical Novel\\", Democrat and Chronicle, New York, New York, 25 November 1971, pg. 191 Wouk wrote that in \\"The Winds of War\\", I did my best to shake up the familiar elements in the kaleidoscope of art, to give them an organizing vision and a shape, so that he who runs might read and picture what happened in this worst world catastrophe - the worst, that is, so far.Wouk Herman, Naval War College Review, U.S. Naval War College Press, WINTER 1998, Vol. 51, No. 1 (WINTER 1998), pp. 123-132. ==Characters== * Victor \\"Pug\\" Henry — A \\"Zelig-like\\" character, he is almost inhumanly stoic, an image that he betrays as a facade through the bold assertions and opinions that come through in his writing. Pug's character is largely to observe the main players in the war. He becomes a trusted adviser to Franklin Roosevelt and meets Hitler, Göering, Churchill, Mussolini and Stalin. * Byron \\"Briny\\" Henry — The middle child, who long ago gave up competing with Warren, often acting (or failing to act) out of what seems to be a sense of spite against his father, who he alternately worships and reviles. War brings out unexpected qualities in him. * Natalie Jastrow — Niece of Aaron and Berel, she is a brilliant writer and historian who also tends towards obstinate and bratty behavior that constantly places her in or near mortal danger. She is Byron's love and eventually his wife. * Warren Henry — Pug's oldest son is the high-achiever of his generation. * Madeline Henry — Drops out of college to work for radio star Hugh Cleveland, providing a look into American radio, where author Herman Wouk was working at the time war broke out in Europe. Briefly she becomes Cleveland's mistress. * Leslie Slote — Foreign Service bureaucrat pursued by Natalie Jastrow until he reveals his physical cowardice during the Siege of Warsaw. Natalie is subsequently impressed with his moral courage in standing up to the Germans and refusing to point out American Jews during the evacuation of neutrals from Warsaw, but ultimately rejects him and confesses her love to Byron. * Rhoda Grover Henry — Pug's wife, she is a bored, selfish and shallow woman, a frustrated actress who thrives on the social power and prestige her husband's rank and position affords her. * Palmer Kirby — Described as a large, ugly man. He owns a business that produces high-quality electromagnets, and becomes a U.S. government contractor for the Manhattan Project. When Germany invades the Soviet Union, Kirby wonders if Hitler is taking this enormous risk because he is confident he will have atomic bombs soon. * Berel Jastrow — A cousin of Natalie's father and of Aaron. * Janice Lacouture Henry — Following her husband Warren to Hawaii, we see the attack on Pearl Harbor through her eyes. ==Other fictional characters== * Pamela Tudsbury — becomes a viewpoint character in the second book, but is seen only through Pug's eyes in this one. She shared an apartment in Paris with Natalie before the war. Acted out by Victoria Tennant in both programs. * Alistair Tudsbury — Pamela's father, an English journalist who fought Germans in the last war and refuses to trust them now. * Hugh Cleveland — A rising radio star with no real knowledge or interest in anything beyond his career, except pretty young women. * Isaac Lacouture — Florida congressman and Janice's father, Ike Lacouture is an isolationist who fights each step the United States makes toward involvement in the war. * Commodore Ernst Grobke — German submariner Pug meets on the Bremen. * Wolf Stoller — Göring's minion, who has made a large fortune arranging the legal robberies of Jewish-owned businesses. * Ludwig Rosenthal — the Jewish owner of the mansion the Henrys rent in Berlin at a ridiculously low rate. * Fred Fearing — American reporter working in Berlin during Pug's assignment there. Fearing also reported on the Spanish Civil War, which wound up in early 1939 just as the novel begins. * Luigi Gianelli — A California banker Pug accompanies on an errand from FDR, an unofficial peace mission. He might have been inspired by A.P. Giannini, founder of the Bank of America. * Sewell \\"Bozey\\" Bozeman — A naive Communist trombone player Madeline dates for a short time. Bozey's only appearance is in Chapter 18, when he sets Warren and Janice right about Stalin's recent doings in Poland and Finland while they visit Madeline in her apartment. ==Reception== The Winds of War was #9 on the New York Times Fiction Best Seller List for November 28, 1971.

Jones, The Sailau E-Voting System, Direct Democracy: Progress and Pitfalls of Election Technology , Michael Yard, ed., International Foundation for Electoral Systems, Sept. 2010; pages 74-95. In this system, the touch-screen voting terminal in the voting booth serves as a ballot marking device, recording selections on a smart card. The voting terminal itself retains no record of the vote after the voter takes the smart card. The voter then takes the smart card containing the cast ballot record to the computer at the registration table that serves as the electronic ballot box where the permanent record of the vote is retained and tabulated. On November 16, 2011, Kuandyk Turgankulov, head of the Central Election Commission, said that the Sailau system would be discontinued because the voters prefer paper ballots, the political parties do not trust it, and the country lacks the funds required to update the system.Sailau e-system will not be used at Kazakhstan parliamentary elections in 2012, Tengri News, Nov. 11, 2011. ==Election Financing== Candidates for elected office in Kazakhstan can receive state financial support to cover campaign costs. In Senate elections, each candidate receives about $2,170. In Senate races, the state budget pays for each candidate’s 15-minute TV address (115 thousand tenge, approx. $303), 10 minutes on the radio (60 thousand tenge, approx. $158), 2 articles in the media (105 thousand tenge, approx. $276), hall rent for meeting with the voters (20 thousand tenge, approx. $53), publication of printed campaign materials (25 thousand tenge, approx. $66) and traveling (for Oblasts - 70 thousand tenge, approx. $184; for Astana and Almaty cities - 35 thousand tenge, approx. $92). ==Observation== There have been several international election observation missions organised in Kazakhstan. The OSCE has observed the elections. { class= style=text-align:right !Elections !date !observing organisation ! head of mission - early Majilis 20160320  ODIHR/OSCE  Boris Frlec - early Majilis 20160320  executive committee/CIS  Sergey Lebedev - early presidential 20150426  ODIHR/OSCE  Cornelia Jonker - early Majilis 20120115  ODIHR/OSCE  Miklós Haraszti - early senate 20120115  ODIHR/OSCE  Miklós Haraszti - } ==Presidential elections== Kazakhstan's president is elected by the people and serves for at most two five-year terms. Term limits were removed for the incumbent Nursultan Nazarbayev on 18 May 2007, when parliament also voted to reduce the term length from seven to five years.Kazakh MPs lift presidency limit BBC News Early presidential elections were called by President Nazarbayev and were held on April 26, 2015.

The National Council (Nationalrat/Conseil National/Consiglio Nazionale/Cussegl Naziunal) has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in multi- seat constituencies, the cantons. The Council of States (Ständerat/Conseil des Etats/Consiglio degli Stati/Cussegl dals Stadis) has 46 members, elected for four years in 20 multi-seat and 6 single-seat constituencies which are equal to the 26 cantons and half-cantons. One of the members of the Federal Council assumes the honorific title of President of the Confederation for a one-year term. Elections to the National Council conclude on the penultimate Sunday of October. In most cantons, the first round of the election for the Council of States is held alongside the National Council election, while runoff stages are held 3 to 6 weeks later.

He gained considerable international and national attention for his wide- ranging contributions in the field of women's health over a period of almost 50 years, although not all of it was positive given the controversial nature of many of his endeavours.Most significant was opposition from ethicists, clergy, academics, feminists and lobby groups to research and development in the field of IVF. ==Biography== After completing his education at Wesley College, Melbourne he graduated in medicine with honours at Melbourne University in 1952. He then held positions as Research Associate at the Rockefeller Institute in New York, and Senior Lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital for Women in London before becoming the Foundation Professor and Chairman of the Monash University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Queen Victoria Hospital and Monash Medical Centre in 1964. Professor Wood received international acclaim in the 1970s for his pioneering work in the fields of obstetric physiology and foetal monitoring as well as in psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology, birth control and finally in in-vitro fertilisation. In 1988 he was recognised with the Axel Munthe Award in Reproductive Science. Professor Wood led the Monash University IVF team in the development of the IVF technique during the late 1970s and early 1980s. His team were responsible for a number of innovations including the world's first IVF pregnancy 1973, world's first IVF baby developed using a frozen embryo 1983, world's first donor egg baby 1983, world's first IVF baby using sperm retrieval surgery 1986 and world's first Microinjection Intra Fallopian Transfer (MIFT) IVF baby 1992.Monash IVF The most important development, however, was the use of pharmaceutical and hormonal stimulation of ovaries for more control of egg maturation and collection, which transformed IVF from an experimental technique to a successful clinical treatment.I.V.F.

The thalidomide story. Sydney Publishing (University of Sydney), 17 January 2016 after a midwife called Sister Pat Sparrow first suspected the drug was causing birth defects in the babies of patients under his care at Crown Street Women's Hospital in Sydney.http://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2018-06-29/thalidomide-william- mcbride-flawed-character-norman-swan/9920608 McBride was awarded a medal and prize money by the prestigious L'Institut de la Vie, a French institute, in connection with his discovery, in 1971. Using the prize money, he established Foundation 41, a Sydney-based medical research foundation concerned with the causes of birth defects. Working with P H Huang, he proposed that thalidomide caused malformations by interacting with the DNA of the dividing embryonic cells. This finding stimulated their experimentation, which showed that thalidomide may inhibit cell division in rapidly dividing cells of malignant tumors. This work was published in the journal \\"Pharmacology and Toxicology\\" in 1999 and has been rated in the top ten of the most important Australian medical discoveries. ===Debendox case=== McBride's involvement in the Debendox case is less illustrious. In 1981, he published a paper indicating that the drug Debendox (marketed in the US as Bendectin) caused birth defects. His co-authors noted that the published paper contained manipulated data and protestedThe Insider, Australian Story, 22 February 2001. Retrieved 26 July 2010 but their voices went unheard. Multiple lawsuits were filed by patients, and McBride was a willing witness for the claimants. Eventually, the case was investigated and, as a result, McBride was struck off the Australian medical register in 1993 for deliberately falsifying data.Thalidomide hero found guilty of scientific fraud – The New Scientist, 27 February 1991 An inquiry determined \\"we are forced to conclude that McBride did publish statements which he either knew were untrue or which he did not genuinely believe to be true, and in that respect was guilty of scientific fraud.\\" He was reinstated to the medical register in 1998.\\"Time Magazine\\" Medical Tribunal of New South Wales Dr. McBride hails end of the affair – \\"The Australian\\" The Bendectin case, and the subsequent removal of the drug from the US market, has had a number of consequences.Brent R. \\"Medical, social, and legal implications of treating nausea and vomiting of pregnancy\\" Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002 May;186(5 Suppl Understanding):S262-6 Firstly, there was an immediate increase in the rates of hospitalization for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Secondly, it created a treatment void in terms of having a safe medication that could be used for alleviating morning sickness in US pregnant women, a condition which, in the most severe form, called hyperemesis gravidarum, could be both life- threatening and cause women to terminate their pregnancy. The removal from the market of a safe and effective drug for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy resulted in the use of other, less studied drugs in pregnancy.Mitchell AA, Gilboa SM, Werler MM, Kelley KE, Louik C, Hernández- Díaz S; National Birth Defects Prevention Study. Medication use during pregnancy, with particular focus on prescription drugs: 1976–2008\\" Am J Obstet Gynecol 2011 Jul;205(1):51.e1-8 Thirdly, it has been claimed that subsequent to the Bendectin experience, drug companies stayed away from developing medications for pregnant patients. As a result, only a few medications were approved by the FDA for obstetrical indications in the past several decades.Centerwatch. FDA Approved Drugs for Obstetrics/Gynecology (Women's Health); as seen in: https://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda- approved-drugs/therapeutic-area/11/obstetrics-gynecology-womens-health Lastly, the perception that all medications are teratogenic increased among pregnant women and healthcare professionals. The unfounded fear of using medications during pregnancy has precluded many women from receiving the treatment they require.

She entered service on 7 October 1866 and arrived at New York on her maiden voyage on 28 October. On 8 August 1869, she collided with and sank the British schooner Mary Bottwood off Hastings, Sussex, United Kingdom, killing three of her four crew and rescuing the survivor. ==Loss== The wreck of the Deutschland The Deutschland sailed from Bremerhaven on 4 December 1875, commanded by Captain Eduard Brickenstein, with 123 emigrants bound for New York via Southampton. Weather conditions were very bad with heavy snowstorms, and the ship had no clear idea of her position until, at 05:00 on 6 December, she ran aground in a blizzard on the Kentish Knock, a shoal off Harwich and from Margate, from the Kentish Knock lightvessel, and out of sight from shore. At the time she was from where Captain Brickenstein estimated she was. Shortly before grounding, an attempt was made to go astern but this failed when the stress fractured the ship's propeller. Driven onto the sandbank, the vessel began to take on water and as the tide rose she failed to lift off the shoal as had been expected. When the sea began to break over her, and the wind rose to gale force, the order was given to abandon ship, causing some panic. One boat was launched, but was swamped, while a second boat, with the quartermaster, a sailor and a passenger aboard, went adrift and eventually reached shore on the Isle of Sheppey the next day with only the quartermaster left alive. The remaining boats were later washed away or destroyed by the stormy seas. Distress rockets were seen on the morning of 6 December by the Sunk lightship, which tried through the day to attract the attention of passing shipping, without success. Later, rockets from that light vessel were seen by another, whose own rockets were seen at Harwich in the evening, though neither the nature nor location of the casualty were known. The paddle tug Liverpool was dispatched at daylight on 7 December, reaching the Deutschland via the sequence of light vessels, and embarked all 173 still alive on the wreck. ==Aftermath== Soon after the news of the disaster had broken, the wreck was raided by men from the nearby coastal towns, particularly Harwich and Ramsgate. An artist from the Illustrated London News produced an illustration of the scene which depicted the wreckers as resembling a flock of vultures. The Times also described the scene, saying that corpses had been ransacked, and their jewellery stolen. While there were some far-fetched suggestions that the Deutschland had been deliberately wrecked, there were well-founded allegations of deliberate delay in coming to the ship's assistance, as well as some of negligence. The Times published a leader which said that the Deutschlands grounding had been known for 15 hours of the 30 hours it took for the tug Liverpool to come to her aid, and Captain Carrington, her master, was criticized for his slowness in acting. The Board of Trade enquiry into the accident opened at Poplar, London, on 20 December. It was not usual to hold such an enquiry in the case of a foreign registered vessel being wrecked outside the three-mile limit, and it may have been done to respond to the criticisms which had been raised regarding the delay in coming to the ship's aid. Charles Butt QC, who had been briefed by the German government, stated that it was surprising that \\"a large steamer with upwards of 200 persons aboard should have lain on a dangerous sand close to the English coast for thirty hours before any assistance came to her\\". The enquiry eventually exonerated everyone of any blame except Captain Brickenstein, who, it was decided, had \\"let his vessel get ahead in its reckoning\\" and \\"shown a very great want of care and judgement\\". Brickenstein asked the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck for an official German investigation, but this was ruled out. A wreck was found in 1969 on the northwestern side of Kentish Knock near the site of the disaster. It lies at a general depth of 14 m. While it could not be definitely identified, its size, condition, and items found by the maritime archeologist Andreas Stolpe in 2005 suggest that it is that of the Deutschland. ==Legacy== Among the victims of the shipwreck were five Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Hearts from Salzkotten, Westphalia, in the Kingdom of Prussia, who had been emigrating to the United States. This was both to escape the anti-Catholic Falk Laws and to answer the need for nursing care in the German population of St. Louis, Missouri. Their deaths inspired Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins to compose the poem The Wreck of the Deutschland. Four of the five Sisters were buried in St. Patrick's Cemetery in Leytonstone, London, (a fifth whose body was never found is recorded on the memorial) and their deaths are commemorated every year in a memorial service held on 6 December in Wheaton, Illinois, by the Franciscan Sisters of their religious congregation now headquartered there. ==See also== * List of shipwrecks * List of United Kingdom disasters by death toll ==References== * ==External links== * The Wreck of the Deutschland -- the poem online Category:Shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:Merchant ships of the Hanseatic League Category:Steamships of Germany Category:Shipwrecks of England Category:Maritime incidents in 1875 Category:1875 in the United Kingdom Category:Ships of Norddeutscher Lloyd Category:1866 ships ","title":"SS Deutschland (1866)"},{"id":"1437937","text":"The Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) is an oil company headquartered in Ahmadi, Kuwait. It is a subsidiary of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a Government- owned holding company. Kuwait was world's 10th largest petroleum and other liquids producer in 2013, and fifth-largest exporter in terms of volume of crude oil and condensates. The managing director of the company is Emad Sultan. ==History== The Kuwait Oil Company was founded in 1934 by Anglo- Persian Oil Company and Gulf Oil as an equally owned partnership. The oil concession rights were awarded to the company on 23 December 1934 and the company started drilling operations in 1936. First oil was discovered in 1938 in Burgan field, followed by discoveries in Magwa in 1951, Ahmadi in 1952, Raudhatain in 1955, Sabriya in 1957, and Minagish in 1959. The initial development of the oil industry coincided with the end of the British Raj in India and many British and Indian administrators and engineers transferred from there to Kuwait. The oil town of Ahmadi was set up to house these workers, and was segregated on racial lines. Such segregation continued in the amenities and recreational facilities offered to company employees. Race to a large extent dictated the status of employees and conditions of employment within the company. In the early part of the 20th century, when the Royal Navy converted their warships to oil burners instead of coal, the British Government depended on a secure supply of Middle Eastern oil. Figures such as Dame Violet Dickson who lived among the Kuwaitis for 40 years were influential in fostering an excellent relationship with the Kuwaitis. The Kuwait Oil Company uses the Kuwait Integrated Digital Field project (KwIDF) for digital oilfield operations. For the meanwhile, KwIDF is one of the most strategic projects the company participated in to support the oil and gas production in Kuwait. BP and Gulf were able to obtain the Kuwaiti oil at very favourable terms for sale via their downstream networks in Europe and adjoining areas. During this time, Gulf would claim that it had a \\"special relationship\\" with Kuwait. However, all this came to an end in 1975 when the KOC reverted to Kuwaiti ownership.

He debuted as one of the two playable characters of the 1998 video game Resident Evil 2. Leon later returned as the lead protagonist of Resident Evil 4 and as one of the seven playable characters of Resident Evil 6. Leon was met with positive critical reception. During the events of Resident Evil 2, Leon is a rookie police officer who arrives in the doomed Raccoon City late for his first day on the job, only to confront a zombie outbreak first-hand. During the course of the game, he teams up with civilian survivor Claire Redfield, rescues the young Sherry Birkin, and is aided by the mysterious Ada Wong. Six years later, in Resident Evil 4, Leon returns as a agent for the U.S. federal government, part of a special anti-Umbrella task force, assigned to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley, from a sinister cult. In Resident Evil 6, he continues to work for the U.S. government and reunites with Ada and an adult Sherry. Leon also appears as a player character in several other video games, and has a leading role in three CG animated films: Resident Evil: Degeneration in 2008 and Resident Evil: Damnation in 2012 and Resident Evil: Vendetta in 2017, in which he is a special agent for the government. The version of Leon in the live-action film series is portrayed by Johann Urb in Resident Evil: Retribution. ==Appearances== ===In video games=== Leon debuted in Resident Evil 2 (1998), as one of the game's two protagonists alongside Claire Redfield. In the story, he is a police officer on his first day who arrives in the Midwestern United States town of Raccoon City just after a viral outbreak started. He meets Claire by chance as she is chased by zombies created by the T-virus. Together, they flee towards the Raccoon City Police Department building but soon get separated and go on their own ways. They eventually meet again at the Umbrella Corporation underground research complex responsible for the viral outbreak. Along the way, Leon teams-up with Ada Wong, a mysterious woman eventually revealed as a spy seeking a sample of the even more powerful G-virus. During the final confrontation against the seemingly unstoppable T-103 Tyrant that constantly pursues the characters, Ada tosses Leon (or Claire, depending on the scenario) a rocket launcher to destroy the creature. In the end, Leon faces and kills the grotesquely mutated Umbrella scientist William Birkin, and escapes from the self-destructing facility along with Claire and Birkin's young daughter Sherry. An epilogue obtained after completing Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) reveals that Leon later joined the U.S. federal government. In Resident Evil - Code: Veronica (2000), Claire contacts Leon to relay information to her brother Chris while stuck on Rockfort Island. Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles (2009) features re-imaginings of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil - Code Veronica; it also contains a new scenario set in 2002 that involves Leon and the soldier Jack Krauser on a mission to search for Javier Hidalgo, an ex-drug lord who had been reported to do business with Umbrella. Leon is the protagonist of Resident Evil 4 (2005). In 2004, he is a special agent assigned to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham who is being held somewhere in Europe. Her kidnappers turn out to be part of an evil cult known as Los Illuminados,Jeremy Parish, \\"LEON KENNEDY,\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly 224 (January 2008), 101. which has taken control of local villagers using parasites known as Las Plagas. As Leon searches for Ashley, he is captured and injected with the parasite. With help from Ada Wong and the Illuminados researcher Luis Sera, Leon is able to remove Las Plagas from his body and to rescue Ashley while confronting the cult. At the climax of the game, Leon kills the cult leader Osmund Saddler, but is forced to give a Plagas sample to Ada, who escapes in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape on a watercraft. Leon is one of the protagonists in Resident Evil 6 (2012), alongside Chris Redfield and Jake Muller. While the game has up to eight playable characters over four different storylines, Leon was described as the \\"main character\\". In the game, he escapes from Tall Oaks, another American town overrun by zombies following a bioterrorist attack that killed the new U.S. president Adam Benford. Leon teams up with fellow survivor and President Benford's bodyguard, the Secret Service agent Helena Harper, to expose the conspiracy that led to the incident. In the later parts of the game, Leon reunites with a grown-up Sherry Birkin, who has become an operative for the U.S. government's Division of Security Operations, and the once again returning Ada Wong, and works to save the world from a global outbreak. Leon also appears in several non-canonical games in the series. He stars alongside Barry Burton in the Game Boy Color-only Resident Evil Gaiden (2001). Along with Claire, Leon is one of two playable characters in the browser and mobile game Resident Evil: Zombie Busters. In the third-person shooter Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City (2012) revisiting the Raccoon City incident, the players control Umbrella operatives sent to kill any survivors, and certain actions can lead to Leon's death. He is also a player character in the \\"Heroes\\" mode of this gameWesley Yin-Poole, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City adds Heroes Mode, Eurogamer.net, 16 December 2011. and is portrayed by the computer-animated film Leon face model, Jamisin Matthews. At E3 in June 2018, Capcom announced a re-imagining of Resident Evil 2 and Leon was shown shooting a zombie.https://www.usgamer.net/articles/13-07-2018-resident- evil-2-remake-release-date ===In film=== Leon teams up with Claire Redfield in the 2008 computer-animated film Resident Evil: Degeneration in order to stop another outbreak of the T-virus on American soil. He returns in the sequel to Degeneration, Resident Evil: Damnation, where he is sent to investigate the use of the Las Plagas during a civil war in Eastern Europe. Starting with Resident Evil: Degeneration, Capcom modeled the computer-animated Leon Kennedy after Jamisin Matthews. Unlike the live-action film series, the animated films are canonically set in the same universe as the game series, serving as the prequels to Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, respectively. A third computer-animated film starring Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Rebecca Chambers was released in 2017.Feature-Length Resident Evil/Biohazard CG Anime Film Green-Lit - News - Anime News Network The main antagonist is Glenn Arias, who has a unique way of getting BOWs not to attack him by distinguishing the difference between ally and enemy, and Leon makes use of a motorcycle that made a special appearance in the film. In an interview, director Paul W. S. Anderson said that, if Resident Evil: Afterlife succeeds, he would do a fifth film and would like Leon to make an appearance in it. Leon then appeared as a major character in Resident Evil: Retribution (2012), \\"poised to rumble with Bad Rain and the defected Jill Valentine\\". The live-action version of Leon is leader of a mercenary group working for Wesker who teams up with the film's version of Ada to fight Umbrella, save Alice and rescue Jill. At the end of the film, he is one of the characters to survive. In the upcoming reboot, Leon will be played by Avan Jogia. ===Other appearances=== Leon is featured in the 1998-1999 manhua Shēnghuà Wēijī 2 (\\"Biological Crisis 2\\"). A romantic comedy retelling of the story of Resident Evil 2, centered on Leon, Claire and Ada, was released in the Taiwanese two-issue comic Èlíng Gǔbǎo II in 1999. Leon is also a character in the Image Comics comic book Resident Evil, and in the novels Resident Evil: City of the Dead and Resident Evil: Underworld by S. D. Perry. He appears in the crossover video game Project X Zone 2 as a solo unit. Leon appears as a Spirit in the Nintendo crossover video game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In 2004, Capcom announced a series of outfits based on Leon's clothing, called \\"Leon's Collection\\". Other Leon merchandise include two action figures by Hot Toys, three action figures by NECA, and more from several other manufacturers, including by Palisades Toys, ToyBiz, and Capcom itself. At Halloween Horror Nights 2013 held at Universal Orlando, Leon was featured as one of two main characters in a haunted house called \\"Resident Evil: Escape from Raccoon City\\", based on Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. ==Design and portrayal== Leon was created by Hideki Kamiya as a contrast to Chris Redfield from the original Resident Evil, who he felt was the \\"blunt, tough-guy type\\". Though Kamiya admitted that while he was a fan of characters like Chris, as it had already been done, he opted to take Leon's development in a different direction. He was surprised at how popular Leon had become, praising his later evolution into a laid back character for Resident Evil 4 and adding that he \\"fell in love all over again\\". Leon was created for Resident Evil 2 as the staff wanted to use a character who had no experience with terrifying situations in contrast to using returning protagonists. While he was originally designed as a veteran police officer, he was changed to a rookie after the original version of Resident Evil 2 (popularly known as \\"Resident Evil 1.5\\") had been scrapped. Leon's design was inspired by the bloodhound of Capcom artist Isao Ohishi. Elements from Leon's backstory from the Resident Evil 2 manual indicating having had a split with a woman were based on Kamiya's own life. Kamiya further commented that the relationship Leon has with Ada is manipulative by the latter. Leon was announced as Resident Evil 4s protagonist in November 2002. As the game was developed, it was intended that Leon would be infected with the Progenitor virus. This concept was expanded upon in 2004, when Leon was meant to contract a bizarre disease in his fight against the game's enemies. In a documentary explaining the conception of the game's characters, it was stated that Leon was intended to \\"look tougher, but also cool\\". His face in Resident Evil 4 was modeled after the game's animation department director Christian Duerre. During the development of Resident Evil: Degeneration, producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi stated that he would like to make another game starring Leon as the main character. Resident Evil 5s producer Jun Takeuchi said that the series' fans \\"would really love\\" a video game featuring both Leon and Chris as the protagonists due to their popularity, and at the same time, it would be \\"pretty dramatic\\" if the two characters never met before the series would end. Resident Evil 6s producer Kobayashi took a liking to Leon and decided to include him in the game since \\"he is central to the story\\". Leon is voiced by Paul Haddad in Resident Evil 2. Paul Mercier takes the role in Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil: Degeneration and Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles. Mercier remembers being happy with the localizer, Shinsaku Ohara, and the team in the making of the game ever since its early demo. Despite initial issues in the making of Resident Evil 4, Mercier was relieved his work as Leon was not removed and also felt joy when having the opportunity to work with director Ginny Mcswain. Nevertheless, Capcom requested Mercier to rerecord some lines because they felt Leon sounded too old for his age. While Leon acts sarcastic in Resident Evil 4, he behaves colder in the first CGI movie; Mercier believes Capcom wanted to make a different take on Leon when developing the movie. Nevertheless, the actor expressed joy in the making of the movie. For the prequel Darkside Chronicles, Mercier expressed difficulties in voicing the younger Leon while still understanding how different he was in this title due to hardships he faces. Mercier was replaced by Matthew Mercer in Resident Evil 6 and Resident Evil: Damnation. Mercer described himself as a fan and friend of Mercier and said that he felt honored to take over as the voice of Leon In an interview, he also detailed his interpretation of Leon and talked about the changes being made to the character.revilbr, Matthew Mercer, voice actor of Leon S. Kennedy (interview), YouTube, September 22, 2012 In the Resident Evil 2 commercial directed by George A. Romero, Leon was portrayed by Brad Renfro. For the remake of the original Resident Evil 2, Leon was modeled after male model Eduard Badaluta. About Johann Urb's casting in Resident Evil: Retribution, the film's producer and director Paul W. S. Anderson said, \\"You have no idea how difficult it is to find someone with Leon Kennedy's hair [who] has to be manly and has to have these long bangs,\\"Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub, Writer-Director Paul W.S.

Anderson said that the decision to include Leon and other game characters in the film was \\"fan-driven\\". Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that \\"he doesn't have a high-pitched voice. I feel like he talks how I naturally talk, which is kind of slower.\\" Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: \\"It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're waiting for it to happen, but it never does. Maybe in the next one, I'm hoping.\\" To meet modern expectations of the remake, the team decided to alter some character designs to better match the more photorealistic setting; for example, Leon no longer wears large shoulder pads, which were added to distinguish his original, low- polygon model. His facial features were based on model Eduard Badaluta. ==Reception== Since his appearance in Resident Evil 2, Leon has had a positive reception. In 2010, Nintendo Power listed him as their 14th favorite Nintendo gaming hero, stating that he went from a \\"glorified meter maid with a bad haircut\\" to a tough guy. In 2009, GameSpot chose him as one of the 64 characters to compete in their poll for the title \\"All Time Greatest Game Hero\\". In a 2010 Famitsu poll, Leon was voted by readers as the 31st most popular video game character in Japan. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the 36th best video game character.

IGN has featured Leon on the list of things they would like to see in Resident Evil 6, calling him one of the two main characters of the series along with Chris Redfield, and describing him in the article about the best zombie fighters as the \\"straight-laced hero\\" of Resident Evil. The IGN character guide made another comparison between Chris and Leon, calling the latter the \\"determined guy clawing his way up the ladder\\". Gameplanet's Aylon Herbet wrote that if both Leon and Chris would share starring roles in a Resident Evil game it would be \\"awesome\\", believing both of them to be the main protagonists of the series. In 2010, GameDaily predicted that Leon, along with Claire Redfield, would be the protagonist of the next main Resident Evil title, citing the series' pattern of alternating protagonists and Leon's last such appearance in Resident Evil 4. In 2013, GamesRadar staff included Leon among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, stating that \\"he’s been battling Chris Redfield for the top spot as resident Resident Evil lead, but to us there’s no contest between the cool, fashionable Leon and the bullish Chris.\\" IGN also repeatedly named him a character they wished to see in the crossover fighting series Super Smash Bros., describing him an \\"intimidating hero\\", a \\"unique breed of ass kicker\\" and one of the best things to happen to the Resident Evil series. GamesRadar described Leon's Resident Evil 4 design as \\"David Bowie piloting the Memphis Belle\\", stating that, while it was appealing, the hairstyle required modifications for encounters in the games. In 2010, Game Informer chose Leon as one of the 20 Capcom characters they would like to see in a rumored crossover fighting game titled Namco Vs Capcom, his Namco equivalent being Nightmare from the Soul series: \\"The only man with enough experience and courage to take out this mutated menace is none other than Leon S. Kennedy. We bet this fight ends with a rocket launcher.\\"Tim Turi, 20 Namco Vs Capcom Matches We'd Love To See , Game Informer, July 20, 2010.

It lies approximately north of Sochaczew and west of Warsaw. Młodzieszyn was first mentioned in the 15th century. Back then it was a small village with a wooden church. The first census of 1564 reported a grand manor in that village, built long ago in the times of Dukes of Masovia. By the 17th century the village grew and became a seat of a local starosta office held by Ludwik Głoszkowski. In 1773 it was annexed by Prussia and another census was organised by the owner of the village, Stanisław Dąbski. Its results are not preserved. In 1827 there were 76 houses and 626 inhabitants in Młodzieszyn. However, in 1870 the estate of Młodzieszyn was divided and a village of Trojanów was created. Six years later the village had 483 inhabitants. Soon afterwards the historical palace of Masovian dukes was destroyed by a fire and replaced with a new manor house. It was surrounded with a picturesque park, now only partially preserved. In the early 20th century the owner of the village and the surrounding estate, Jerzy Iwanicki, had 11.2 square kilometres of land. The family of Iwanicki were the owners of the village until after the World War II, when they were expelled and their property nationalised by the new communist Polish authorities. During World War II the bellhouse of the local Our Lady's Church was turned by the Germans into a local prison, in which at least 30 prisoners were murdered.

During his career, Mitri was the Italian and European middleweight champion. Mitri's professional debut, was 1 August 1946, and over the span of his first four years of fighting, racked up an undefeated record of 50–0. During this period, he won the Italian middleweight crown by defeating Giovanni Manca (1948), then added the European title with a points win over Cyrille Dellannoit of Belgium. He first defended the European honors, by decisioning Jean Stock of France.The Encyclopedia of Boxing by Gilbert Odd It was on the strength of this resume, Mitri won the right to challenge for the world middleweight championship...though, perversely, he landed the opportunity, as a substitute for Rocky Graziano.(The Ring) Boxing: The 20th Century, compiled by Stanley Weston and Steve Farhood On 11 July 1950, at Madison Square Garden, Mitri lost to middleweight champion Jake LaMotta, in a 15-round decision. Sources regarding the closeness of the contest, vary. The Encyclopedia of Boxing, compiled by Gilbert Odd (First Edition, 1983), has Mitri losing on points \\"narrowly\\". Jake LaMotta's famed autobiography, \\"\\"Raging Bull\\"\\" (1970), is rather less charitable. LaMotta, in standard candor, does not lend credit to Mitri for his staying the distance, stating that according to sports publicity, \\"(Mitri) was a pretty good fighter, a lot like (Marcel) Cerdan\\", then opining, \\"Like Cerdan, he wasn't.\\"Raging Bull (My Story) by Jake LaMotta LaMotta backs this negative assessment of Mitri, by questioning Mitri's balance in the ring, underlining the tenet of professional prizefighting, towit, \\"one thing a top fighter rarely is, is off balance.\\" LaMotta claims that this bad balance issue, accounted for the fight lasting the 15, \\"because it's hard to fight that kind of fighter\\". LaMotta viewed any taking of chances as unnecessary, e.g. \\"I was piling up points so fast...\\"Raging Bull (My Story) by Jake LaMotta In fairness to the subject, boxrec.com lists the official scores (NY State Athletic Commission rules, ca. 1950, allowing for a \\"rounds basis\\", as won), as follows: referee: Mark Conn 3-12 judge: Joe Agnello 6-9 judge: Bert Grant 7-8 boxrec.com Mitri's most famous win came soon after, at the expense of former world middleweight champion Randy Turpin. On, 2 May 1954, fighting in Rome, Mitri scored a surprising upset, knocking out Turpin in only 65 seconds, to reclaim the European middleweight crown. Mitri at last lost his E.B.U. honors, when stopped by France's Charlie Humez, in 3. Mitri fought for another 2 years, chalking only one loss against 18 victories.The Encyclopedia of Boxing by Gilbert Odd His most memorable fight, was on New Year's Day, 11:30PM, Sunday January 1, 1956, as a New Year's main event. Mitri, still the Italian & European Middleweight champ, won this famous & exciting bout (by TKO/RTD) when his opponent Bill Jo Cohen refused to answer the bell for the 8th round. Mitri was ahead on points, at the time of stoppage. Mitri, one of the few boxers who traveled to fight widely outside Italy, retired in 1957, having logged a total of 99 professional tiffs.The Encyclopedia of Boxing by Gilbert Odd Mitri also acted in popular Italian cinema. ==References== ==External links== * The autobiography of Tiberio Mitri: La botta in testa Category:1926 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Middleweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from Trieste Category:Italian male film actors Category:Italian male boxers ","title":"Tiberio Mitri"},{"id":"1437982","text":"The Zab Emirate () was a short lived emirate around 1400 in the highlands and desert fringes of what is today eastern Algeria.

This process is activated during rest periods following the Cori cycle, in the liver, and also activated by insulin in response to high glucose levels. ==Steps== thumb *Glucose is converted into glucose 6-phosphate by the action of glucokinase or hexokinase with conversion of ATP to ADP. * Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into glucose-1-phosphate by the action of phosphoglucomutase, passing through the obligatory intermediate glucose-1,6-bisphosphate. * Glucose-1-phosphate is converted into UDP-glucose by the action of the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Pyrophosphate is formed, which is later hydrolysed by pyrophosphatase into two phosphate molecules. * The enzyme glycogenin is needed to create initial short glycogen chains, which are then lengthened and branched by the other enzymes of glycogenesis. Glycogenin, a homodimer, has a tyrosine residue on each subunit that serves as the anchor for the reducing end of glycogen. Initially, about seven UDP-glucose molecules are added to each tyrosine residue by glycogenin, forming α(1→4) bonds. * Once a chain of seven glucose monomers is formed, glycogen synthase binds to the growing glycogen chain and adds UDP-glucose to the 4-hydroxyl group of the glucosyl residue on the non-reducing end of the glycogen chain, forming more α(1→4) bonds in the process. * Branches are made by glycogen branching enzyme (also known as amylo-α(1:4)→α(1:6)transglycosylase), which transfers the end of the chain onto an earlier part via α-1:6 glycosidic bond, forming branches, which further grow by addition of more α-1:4 glycosidic units. { class=\\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\\" width=\\"100%\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" ! Metabolism of common monosaccharides, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis and glycogenolysis - 1000px } ==Control and regulations== Glycogenesis responds to hormonal control. One of the main forms of control is the varied phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. This is regulated by enzymes under the control of hormonal activity, which is in turn regulated by many factors. As such, there are many different possible effectors when compared to allosteric systems of regulation. ===Epinephrine (adrenaline)=== Glycogen phosphorylase is activated by phosphorylation, whereas glycogen synthase is inhibited. Glycogen phosphorylase is converted from its less active \\"b\\" form to an active \\"a\\" form by the enzyme phosphorylase kinase. This latter enzyme is itself activated by protein kinase A and deactivated by phosphoprotein phosphatase-1. Protein kinase A itself is activated by the hormone adrenaline. Epinephrine binds to a receptor protein that activates adenylate cyclase. The latter enzyme causes the formation of cyclic AMP from ATP; two molecules of cyclic AMP bind to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, which activates it allowing the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to dissociate from the assembly and to phosphorylate other proteins. Returning to glycogen phosphorylase, the less active \\"b\\" form can itself be activated without the conformational change. 5'AMP acts as an allosteric activator, whereas ATP is an inhibitor, as already seen with phosphofructokinase control, helping to change the rate of flux in response to energy demand. Epinephrine not only activates glycogen phosphorylase but also inhibits glycogen synthase. This amplifies the effect of activating glycogen phosphorylase. This inhibition is achieved by a similar mechanism, as protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate the enzyme, which lowers activity. This is known as co-ordinate reciprocal control. Refer to glycolysis for further information of the regulation of glycogenesis. ===Calcium ions=== Calcium ions or cyclic AMP (cAMP) act as secondary messengers. This is an example of negative control. The calcium ions activate phosphorylase kinase. This activates glycogen phosphorylase and inhibits glycogen synthase. ==See also== *Glycogenolysis *Glycogen synthase *Glycogen storage disease ==External links== Category:Metabolic pathways ","title":"Glycogenesis"},{"id":"1438001","text":"Elizabeth Curtis Sittenfeld (born 1975) is an American writer.

It belongs to the monotypic family Eucommiaceae. It is considered vulnerable in the wild, but is widely cultivated in China for its bark and is highly valued in herbology such as traditional Chinese medicine. ==Description== Eucommia ulmoides grows to about 15 m tall. The leaves are deciduous, arranged alternately, simple ovate with an acuminate tip, 8–16 cm long, and with a serrated margin. If a leaf is torn across, strands of latex exuded from the leaf veins solidify into rubber and hold the two parts of the leaf together. It flowers from March to May. The flowers are inconspicuous, small and greenish; the fruit, June to November, is a winged samara with one seed, very similar to an elm samara in appearance, 2–3 cm long and 1–2 cm broad. ==Taxonomy== E. ulmoides is the sole living species of the genus Eucommia. Eucommia is the only genus of the family Eucommiaceae, and was formerly considered to be a separate order, the Eucommiales. It is also sometimes known as \\"gutta-percha tree\\" or \\"Chinese rubber tree\\", but is not related to either the true gutta-percha tree of southeastern Asia, nor to the South American rubber tree. ==Distribution== This tree is also occasionally planted in botanical gardens and other gardens in Europe, North America and elsewhere, being of interest as the only cold-tolerant (to at least -30 °C) rubber- producing tree. Fossils of other Eucommia species have been found in 10- to 35-million-year-old brown coal deposits in central Europe and widely in North America, indicating that the genus had a much wider range in the past. ==Uses== Eucommia ulmoides pastilles, known as dùzhòngwán (Chinese: 杜仲丸) It is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in Chinese herbology, where it is called dùzhòng (). Because of the low production and high demand for natural rubber in China, a unique process has been developed to manufacture elastic materials with Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) as substitutes for natural rubber products. Unlike the latex used to produce natural rubber, the EUG is the polymer trans-1,4-polyisoprene. Thus materials made from EUG may demonstrate characteristics other than those of natural rubber, such as higher elasticity, lower thermoplastic temperature, etc. ==Chemistry== The iridoid glucoside geniposidic acid can be found in E. ulmoides. ==See also== * Chinese herbology 50 fundamental herbs ==References== * HUEC Nutrition & Obesity (including Eucommia bark results) online (ppt) Category:Garryales Category:Trees of China Category:Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine Category:Near threatened plants Category:Endemic flora of China Category:Taxa named by Daniel Oliver ","title":"Eucommia ulmoides"},{"id":"1438007","text":"The Caledonian Ocean is the archaic name for the north Atlantic Ocean.

It is considered part of Greater Rouen, being just to the northeast, at the junction of the D43 and the D928 roads. ==History== Bois- Guillaume was originally a Gallo-Roman settlement of which few traces remain. Local legend claims that in 1040 William the Conqueror's mother built a country house on the hill and the area thus came to be known variously as Boscum Guillelmi or Bosco Willelmi, later becoming Bois-Guillaume. There is, however, no serious evidence of any link to William the Conqueror; this derivation of the town's name is therefore in all likelihood a folk etymology. By the late 19th century, nearby Rouen had expanded to such an extent that parts of Bois-Guillaume had become urbanized. This led to tensions between the urban neighborhoods closest to Rouen (such as Bihorel) and the rest of the commune, which had remained more rural. The situation came to a head in 1892, when Bihorel split from Bois-Guillaume and became a commune in its own right. As a result of the split, the commune of Bois-Guillaume saw its territory reduced by 22% and its population reduced by 38%. In 2010, the municipal councils of Bois-Guillaume and Bihorel began to cooperate more closely, with a view to merging in order to become a single commune once again. In July 2011, despite opposition among residents of both communes, the merger was approved by the two municipal councils and ratified by prefectoral order on 29 August 2011. The new commune of Bois-Guillaume-Bihorel came into being on 1 January 2012. Following an appeal, however, the prefectoral order was repealed on 18 June 2013, and the new commune was disbanded on 31 December 2013; on 1 January 2014, the two former communes of Bois-Guillaume and Bihorel were reinstated. ==Activities== Bois-Guillaume is well known for its tranquility.

He played college football for Louisiana State University (LSU), and earned consensus All-America honors. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in first round of the 1998 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Steelers, New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals of the NFL. A six-time first- team All-Pro and nine-time Pro Bowl selection, Faneca won a Super Bowl ring with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL, defeating the Seattle Seahawks. ==Early years== Faneca attended Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas, lettering in football and track. He was an All-Greater Houston, Orlando Sentinel All-South, and Touchdown Club of Houston player of the year. Faneca began having seizures, which were later diagnosed as epilepsy, at age 15.Epilepsy Fdn.-Not Faster than a Speeding Bullet, but More Powerful than a Locomotive, this Man of Steel is an Inspiration for Everyone He started on medication to control it and was able to continue playing football. ==College career== Faneca attended Louisiana State University, and played for the LSU Tigers football team from 1994 to 1997. As a freshman in 1994, he was redshirted. He was voted the Southeastern Conference freshman of the year by the Knoxville News Sentinel in 1995. In 1996, he was selected as a second-team All-American. As a junior in 1997, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and was also one of three finalists for 1997 Outland Trophy. In the 1997 home game against the Florida Gators, Faneca was called \\"a beast\\" for having repeatedly driven the Gators off the field and creating openings for the Tiger backs to charge through.Chet Hilburn, The Mystique of Tiger Stadium: 25 Greatest Games: The Ascension of LSU Football (Bloomington, Indiana: WestBow Press, 2012), p. 28 Faneca started his last 36 games at LSU and allowed only one sack in his final season. He had 210 pancake blocks in his college career. He returned to school in 1999 and earned a bachelor's degree in management entrepreneurship. ==Professional career== ===Pittsburgh Steelers=== Faneca was picked by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round (26th overall) in the 1998 NFL Draft. He saw limited playing time at first but injuries to fellow Steelers Will Wolford and Jim Sweeney allowed him to get his first start against the Cincinnati Bengals. He earned the Joe Greene Award as the team's top rookie. In 1999 against the Cleveland Browns he was having a bad season debut before leaving the game at halftime, after suffering a left ankle injury late in the second quarter of the game and played the rest of the first half after sustaining the injury but did not play during the second half. Against Baltimore Ravens he returned from his ankle injury but was replaced in the second half by Roger Duffy. One of his best games on the Season was against the Cincinnati Bengals helping to pave the way for Jerome Bettis first 100-yard game of that season. Against the Carolina Panthers helped pave the way for Bettis season-high 137 yards rushing and the Steelers second highest rushing performance of the season. In 2000, Faneca helped the Steelers rank fourth in the league in rushing, one of only 10 teams to compile more than 2,000 yards rushing in 2000. He had his best season to date when he was named a starter in the 2002 Pro Bowl his first selection to the squad, and also was named All-Pro by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, Sports Illustrated and Football Digest, and was named to Pro Football Weekly's-All- NFL team. He had an offseason surgery on his right wrist and missed some playing time during the teams preseason. In 2002 season was named to Pro Football Weekly's All-NFL and All-AFC team. Also selected to the USA Today Sports Weekly's All-Pro team was voted to his second consecutive Pro Bowl In 2003, he switched positions from left guard to left tackle due to injuries, helping teammate Amos Zereoué to three 100-yard performances during the season. He helped running backs Jerome Bettis, Duce Staley, and Willie Parker set individual and team rushing records, as well as propelling the Steelers to Super Bowl XL in Detroit, in which Pittsburgh defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10. He helped spring Parker to a 75-yard touchdown run that is currently the longest run in Super Bowl history. In the 2007 season he helped quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to a perfect passer rating of 158.3 and Najeh Davenport to 123 rushing yards in Week 16 at St. Louis Rams. He led the way for Willie Parker's 105-yard rushing performance in Week 10 against the Browns, and was the key to Steelers ground attack rolling for 205 yards in Week 3 vs. San Francisco 49ers, as well as the 206-yard rushing effort in the season opener at Cleveland. In 2007, Faneca was voted to the Steelers 75th Anniversary All Time Team by Steeler fans. ===New York Jets=== On March 1, 2008, the New York Jets signed Faneca to a five-year, $40 million contract, with $21 million in guarantees. The contract made Faneca the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history (a distinction quickly overtaken by rookie Jake Long). Faneca was expected to provide veteran leadership to a Jets offensive line that included three former first round picks from 1999 and 2006, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, Nick Mangold and Damien Woody. Later that offseason, the Jets acquired Brett Favre via trade from Green Bay. Favre and Faneca have since been nominated as Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement finalists, with Favre being inducted in 2016. As of 2019, Faneca remains a finalist.http://m.steelers.com/news/article-1/Faneca-a-finalist-for-HOF-Class- of-2017/e8119c1c-4b82-41a9-9a89-5b00f01de30c Faneca with the Jets in 2009. Faneca rapidly made an impact on the Jets rushing attack, propelling it to 2006 yards and 20 touchdowns,http://www.nfl.com/teams/newyorkjets/statistics?season=2008&team;=NYJ&seasonType;= and led the 4-12 Jets to a 9-7 record in 2008, good for third in the AFC East. In 2009, Faneca anchored the Jets to 2756 yards and 21 touchdowns, again leading the Jets to a 9-7 record and securing a wild-card playoff berth. They proceeded to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals in a 24-14 victory in that wildcard game. In an AFC divisional playoff game, the Jets beat the favored San Diego Chargers 17-14 behind Shonn Greene's 128 rushing yards and a touchdown and Thomas Jones's 41 yards, totaling 169 yards on the ground. They surprised many observers by beating the Chargers and going to the AFC Championship game where they eventually succumbed to the Indianapolis Colts 30-17. Faneca was cut from the Jets on April 24, 2010 after they selected Vladimir Ducasse in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft.. ===Arizona Cardinals=== Faneca agreed to terms with the Arizona Cardinals on a one-year, $2.5 million deal, which included a $300,000 signing bonus and a $100,000 workout bonus,. and reunited him with his former Steelers coach Ken Whisenhunt and offensive line coach Russ Grimm. ===Retirement=== Faneca retired on May 10, 2011, ending his distinguished career with nine Pro Bowl appearances, eight All-Pro selections, and one Super Bowl ring.

It is also one of many names used commercially for the wood of the most economically important rubber tree, H. brasiliensis. The genus is native to tropical South America but is widely cultivated in other tropical countries and naturalized in several of them. It was first described in 1775. ==Characteristics== French botanist and explorer Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet first described Hevea as a genus in 1775.Aublet, Jean Baptiste Christophe Fusée. 1775. Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane Françoise 2: 871–873 description in Latin, commentary in FrenchAublet, Jean Baptiste Christophe Fusée. 1775. Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane Françoise vol 4, plate 335 line drawing depicting H. peruviana, synonym of H. guianensis, accompanying original 1775 description of genusTropicos, Hevea Aubl. H. brasiliensis and H. guianensis are large trees, often reaching more than in height. Most of the other members of the genus are small to medium trees, and H. camporum is a shrub of around . Trees in this genus are either deciduous or evergreen. Certain species, namely H. benthamiana, H. brasiliensis and H. microphylla, bear \\"winter shoots\\", stubby side shoots with short internodes, scale leaves on the stem and larger leaves near the tip; on these, the leaves are shed leaving the tree bare before new shoots develop. The remaining species bear more vigorous side shoots which develop before the old foliage is shed and thus the tree remains green. The leaves consist of three, usually elliptical, leaflets which are held horizontally or slightly drooping in most species. The inflorescences have separate male and female flowers, with the females being at the end of the panicles. The fruits are capsules, usually with three seeds, which in all except two species (H. spruceana and H. microphylla) split explosively when ripe to eject the large seeds. ==Distribution== The genus occurs naturally in tropical South America, mostly in the Amazon basin. To the north of the basin, the land rises to the watershed of the Guiana Shield on the border between Brazil and Venezuela, and the southern foothills of these mountains form the northerly limit of the genus. It is also present in the upper reaches of the Orinoco River. The genus extends westwards as far as the foothills of the Andes and southwards to the foothills of the Mato Grosso. Its easterly limit is the Atlantic Ocean. The most widespread species is H. guianensis which occurs over the whole range of the genus. The Pará rubber tree (H. brasiliensis) occurs mainly south of the Amazon, as does H. camporum, but the greatest diversity occurs to the north of the river, in the Rio Negro region, where all the other species occur. In this area where there are variations in soil and topography and the rainforest experiences conditions of all-year-round humidity, the genus Hevea has been undergoing a high degree of speciation. The high humidity encourages the growth of fungal leaf diseases, and the species that are deciduous avoid immediate transfer of fungal spores from old leaves onto new growth. The Pará rubber tree has been introduced to and is naturalised in many tropical countries in Asia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesGovaerts, R., Frodin, D.G. & Radcliffe-Smith, A. (2000). World Checklist and Bibliography of Euphorbiaceae (and Pandaceae) 1–4: 1–1622. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ==Habitat== Each species has its own habitat requirements; H. brasiliensis grows on well- drained soils but tolerates light flooding; H. guianensis, H. pauciflora and H. rigidifolia grow in well-drained soil, on high river banks and on slopes; and H. camporum grows on savannahs. Other species such as H. benthamiana, H. microphylla and H. spruceana need wetter conditions in locations subject to seasonal flooding for several months each year, and H. nitida grows both in periodically inundated swamps and in drier locations such as rocky hillsides well above the flood level. ==Species== The following species are recognised: # Hevea benthamiana Müll.Arg. – Venezuela, SE Colombia, N Brazil # Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A.Juss.)

Christian Brevoort Zabriskie (October 16, 1864 - February 8, 1936) was an American businessman and vice president of Pacific Coast Borax Company. Zabriskie Point on the northeasternmost flank of the Black Mountains east of Death Valley, located in Death Valley National Park is named after him. ==Early years== Christian Brevoort Zabriskie was born at Fort Bridger in Wyoming Territory, where his father, Capt. Elias B. Zabriskie, was stationed. The Zabriskie family descended from Albrycht Zaborowski (Albert Zabriskie), a Polish immigrant from Angerburg (Węgorzewo) in Ducal Prussia, who settled in New Jersey in 1662 alongside a Dutch community. Young Zabriskie attended various schools while growing up and at a very early age went to work as a telegrapher for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Carson City, Nevada. He was too restless and ambitious to stay in one place for very long and soon moved to Candelaria, Nevada, and worked for the Esmeralda County Bank. Being an active young man, one job was not enough to keep him occupied and he soon branched out into other ventures, one of which was a partnership with a local cabinet maker to establish a mortuary. Neither of the two knew how to embalm, but it was not considered necessary in a mining town -- prompt burial was. ==Borax career== Zabriskie's life took on new meaning in 1885 when F.M. \\"Borax\\" Smith hired him to supervise several hundred Chinese laborers at the Columbus Marsh area of the Pacific Coast Borax Company near Candelaria. This was the beginning of a lifelong career in the borax industry. He ultimately became vice president and general manager of the company and served in that capacity for thirty-six years until his retirement in 1933. During this time, the Pacific Coast Borax Company had phased out most of its borax operations in the Candelaria vicinity but had moved on to greater production in the Death Valley area, the Calico Mountains near Yermo, California, and Searles Lake near Trona, California. All this occurred long before 1933, when the area became Death Valley National Monument, but Zabriskie Point remains to honor a man who devoted many years of dedicated service to the Pacific Coast Borax Company. He died just three years after his retirement, in 1936. ==See also== *Twenty Mule Team Borax *Borate and Daggett Railroad *Trona Railway *Category: Death Valley ==References== Category:American mining businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from California Category:1864 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Death Valley Category:History of the Mojave Desert region Category:People from Carson City, Nevada Category:People from Inyo County, California Category:People from Oakland, California Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American people of Polish descent Category:19th-century American businesspeople Category:20th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Christian Brevoort Zabriskie"},{"id":"1438112","text":"Orlando Lamar Pace (born November 4, 1975) is a former American football tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the St. Louis Rams. Pace played college football for Ohio State University, where he was twice recognized as a unanimous All-American, and was selected by the Rams first overall in the 1997 NFL Draft. He spent all but one season of his professional career in St. Louis, concluding his NFL tenure as a member of the Chicago Bears. Pace was recognized as the cornerstone of a Rams offensive line that blocked for an offense compiling more gross yards than any other team during his 12 years with the team (50,770 in 12 seasons), second in completion percentage (61.8 percent), and fifth in touchdown passes (289) over that time. Under Pace's protection, the Rams' passing offense compiled more than 3,000 yards in all 12 of seasons, seven different quarterbacks eclipsed the 3,000-yard mark in a season (including three times surpassing the 4,000-yard mark), and blocked for seven 1,000-yard rushers. Pace also protected the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) recipient for three consecutive seasons, blocking for 1999/2001 MVP Kurt Warner and 2000 MVP Marshall Faulk. Retiring as a three-time first-team All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl selection, Pace was a core contributor of the Rams' Greatest Show on Turf offense that won the franchise's first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXIV. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016. ==Early years== Pace was born in Sandusky, Ohio. He was a two-sport athlete for the Sandusky Blue Streaks at Sandusky High School. He had a successful football career. He was named to the Parade magazine high school All-America team as an offensive lineman and the USA Today All-America team as a defensive lineman. ==College career== Pace attended The Ohio State University, where he majored in business and played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1994 to 1996. He was only the second true freshman ever to start on opening day for the Buckeyes football team. He was a two-time consensus first-team All-American, and won the Outland Trophy in 1996 for the best college football interior lineman. He won the Lombardi Award for the best college lineman or linebacker in 1995 and 1996, becoming the only two-time winner of that award, and the most recent (through 2017) offensive lineman to be honored. He is one of only twelve players to have won both the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award. He and Dave Rimington are the only three-time winners in the Outland/Lombardi category. He was a finalist for the 1996 Heisman Trophy, finishing fourth in the voting, the highest finish for a lineman (offense or defense) since Hugh Green finished second in 1980. Pace also lined up at defensive tackle during some goal line situations during his junior year at Ohio State. Pace was so dominant that the term pancake block—referring to when an offensive lineman knocks a defender on his back—gained popularity at Ohio State due to his play. He was nicknamed \\"The Pancake Man.\\"St. Louis Rams Roster: Orlando Pace . The Official Website of the St. Louis Rams.

Retrieved September 13, 2006 Several other college teams have been using the term since the 1980s, most notably Nebraska. In fact, the Ohio State Athletic Department distributed Orlando Pace pancake magnets as a promotion for his Heisman Trophy run. Pace did not allow a sack in his last two years at Ohio State. Pace finished 4th in the Heisman trophy in 1996,https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/awards/heisman-1996.html which was practically unheard of for an offensive lineman, and demonstrated his dominance at the college level. In 1999, Pace was selected as a starting offensive tackle by Sports Illustrated in their \\"NCAA Football All-Century Team\\". The other starting offensive tackle on that list was Bill Fralic. Pace was one of five Ohio State Buckeyes on Sport Illustrated's All-Century Team 85-man roster; the others being Jim Parker, Archie Griffin, Chris Spielman and Jack Tatum. In 2013, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== ===1997 NFL Draft=== After Peyton Manning chose to skip the 1997 NFL Draft and return to Tennessee, Pace was considered to be the top candidate for the Jets′ selection at No. 1 in the draft. The Jets traded their top pick to the Rams one day before the draft. Pace was picked by Rams as the first offensive lineman since Ron Yary in 1968 to be drafted first overall. ===St. Louis Rams=== After a three-week holdout, on August 15, 1997, Pace signed a seven-year $29.4 million contract that included a $6.3 million signing bonus. Pace played 13 games during the 1997 season, his rookie year. He made his first start against the Oakland Raiders on September 28, 1997 and started every game for the rest of the season. In 1998, Pace started 16 games at the left tackle position and was named Pro Bowl alternate. In the 1999 season, Pace played in 896 of 994 offensive plays and was selected to his first Pro Bowl. It was the first time that a Rams' offensive tackle was named to the Pro Bowl since Jackie Slater in 1990. Pace was also a First-team All- Pro for the Super Bowl winning Rams. In the 2000 season, Pace earned second consecutive Pro Bowl invitation, starting all 16 regular season games and 1 playoff game. Pace was anchor of offensive line that helped offense produce most passing yards in NFL history, playing in 1,006 of possible 1,013 offensive plays (99.3 percent), second highest total on offensive line. Pace was one of three Rams' offensive linemen (C Andy McCollum, RT Ryan Tucker) who were not penalized for holding. In 2001, Pace started every game for the fourth consecutive season. He played in 100 percent of offensive plays, joining Adam Timmerman as the only Rams to play in every offensive play. He started all three playoff contests, the St. Louis Rams claimed the NFC West title and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVI falling to New England Patriots, 20-17. He earned third consecutive Pro Bowl invitation. In 2002, despite missing six games due to injury (three to calf injury games 4-6; three to hamstring games 13-16), Pace earned his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl invitation. Pace had a lengthy holdout by reporting to camp on August 26, 2003, and signing a one- year deal as the Rams franchise player. The deal was worth $5.7 million. In 2003, Pace started all 16 regular season games and one playoff game, he helped the Rams' offense to rank second in the NFL with an average of 27.9 points a game. He earned a fifth consecutive Pro Bowl invitation as the Rams claimed their third NFC West title in five years. On September 5, 2004, Pace ended another holdout and signed the Rams' $7.02 million offer. It marked the second straight year Pace missed most or all of the preseason before signing his one- year tender. By designating Pace as a franchise player, the Rams were obligated to pay him the average salary of the five highest-paid offensive linemen in the NFL. Pace went on to start all 16 regular season games at left tackle and both playoff games. He was one of three linemen to start every game (C Andy McCollum, G Adam Timmerman) and blocked for an offense that ranked eighth in the NFL (third in the NFC) in first downs (321). Pace helped Rams convert 13-of-16 fourth down attempts, second highest fourth-down conversion percentage in the NFL (68.4%). He earned his sixth consecutive Pro Bowl invitation. Pace was a free agent in 2005 and explored the possibility of signing with another team. The Rams placed the franchise tag on Pace again. In March, he visited the Houston Texans. The problem for Pace and the Texans was that if they work out an agreement, the Texans would have had to agree with the Rams on a compensation package, which would be two first-round draft choices which the Rams would be entitled to under the franchise-player rules.Maske, Mark (3-15-2005).Washington Post Retrieved September 12, 2010. However, the day before the deadline, Pace accepted a seven-year, $52.9 million deal. The deal included $18 million in first-year salary and bonus.(3-17-2005)Associated Press Retrieved September 12, 2010. In 2005, Pace earned seventh consecutive Pro Bowl invitation, tying him for fourth in Rams history, behind Hall of Famer DT Merlin Olsen (14), Hall of Famer G Tom Mack (11), and LB Les Richter (8). That season, Pace started all 16 games at left tackle, joining C Andy McCollum and G Adam Timmerman as only Rams linemen to start every game. In 2006, Pace started the 8 games he appeared in until he left in the second quarter against the Seattle Seahawks on November 12, 2006 after he tore his triceps, ending his 2006 season. He was placed on Injured Reserve on November 14. Pace was injured during the Rams' 2007 season opener against the Carolina Panthers on September 9, 2007. Officials confirmed that Pace would be out for the entire 2007 season, severely jeopardizing the Rams' offense for the remainder of the season. In 2008, Pace played in and started 14 games, missing only two with an injury, compared to the 15 he missed in 2007 and the 8 he missed in 2006. However, the Rams struggled on the field and their head coach Scott Linehan was fired mid-season and the team fared little better under interim head coach Jim Haslett and the team finished 2-14. Dogged by injuries in recent seasons, Pace was released by the Rams on March 10, 2009,Rams release Pace , St. Louis Rams, March 10, 2009 to save $6 million under the salary cap.Orlando Pace released by St. Louis Rams , St. Louis Post- Dispatch, March 10, 2009 ===Chicago Bears=== Pace signed a three-year $15 million deal (with $6.1 million guaranteed), with the Chicago Bears on April 2, 2009. Pace started the first 11 games at left tackle in his lone season with the Bears in 2009 before sustaining a groin injury on November 29 in a loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He later finished the year as a reserve behind 2008 first-round draft pick Chris Williams. He was released on March 1, 2010.

Part of the area forms Fairview Park, a recreational amenity laid-out on land reclaimed from the sea. ==Location== Fairview is reached on a main road artery from Dublin city via North Strand, which continues on as the Malahide, Howth and Clontarf Roads. It is served by the Clontarf Road DART station. The area can also be reached by way of several Dublin Bus routes from the city centre, including 14, 15, 27/ABNX, 29A/N, 31/B, 32/ABX, 42/N, 43, 123, and 130. Neighbouring districts include Marino to the north, North Strand and Ballybough to the west, East Wall to the southwest, and Clontarf to the east. ==Name and history== The Irish name seen on street signs opposite Fairview Park, as well as on Fairview Avenue and Fairview Terrace, is Baile Bocht, rather than the current Fionnradharc, which suggests that this area was originally part of Ballybough, the neighbouring community on the far side of the river Tolka. Fairview began to grow after the building of Annesley Bridge in 1797 opened up easy access to the land; since 1488 there had been no crossing of the River Tolka below Ballybough Bridge. Administratively, Fairview and Marino were part of the old townland of Clonturk, which also included Drumcondra. Fairview Strand was formally known as Owen Roe Terrace and Philipsburgh Strand. Philipsburgh Avenue was called Ellis's Lane and a small area around there was known as Annadale, home to one of Dublin's earliest Jewish communities.History of Fairview and Marino Annadale House was located in an estate that now comprises Melrose Avenue, Lomond Avenue, Waverly Avenue, and Inverness Road.Ordnance Survey of Ireland maps, 1847 and 1913 On Fairview Strand, near Luke Kelly bridge, is Dublin's oldest Jewish Cemetery, Ballybough Cemetery. The graveyard was built in 1718, with a mortuary chapel added in 1857 (the Hebrew date 5618 is inscribed on the front), and contains more than 200 graves. The last burial there was in 1958. ==Amenities== The main commercial areas are Fairview, a busy road alongside Fairview Park, and Fairview Strand, a narrower commercial and residential strip running from Edge's Corner around to Luke Kelly Bridge. St Vincent's Hospital was founded by the Daughters of Charity in 1857. Located on the Richmond Road, it provides psychiatric services for the northeast quadrant of Dublin city. The area also includes Dublin's first 50-metre swimming pool, at the West Wood Club, built on a former waste depot adjacent to Fairview Park. Other facilities at West Wood include tennis courts, a climbing wall, gym, childcare, day spa, café, squash, football, an Irish-language Montessori, and the Dracula Museum. Ireland's largest sporting stadium and home to the Gaelic Athletic Association - the GAA - Croke Park is located near Fairview. Fairview and Marino both contain restaurants, cafes and pubs, which draw trade from events at Croke Park. ===Parks=== Fairview Park () has playing fields, a children's playground and tree-lined walks. Originally a tidal mud flat which was used for land fill in the early 1900s, the park was developed in the late 1920s and bye laws were formally adopted by Dublin Corporation in 1934. The Tolka River runs right past the park, Clontarf Road DART station is located near the park, and across the railway line there is a 400-metre athletics track and a Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann hall. A memorial statue of Seán Russell was unveiled by Cumann Uaigheann Na Laochra Gael, (the National Graves Association group), in Fairview Park, September 1951. A new statue of him was erected in May 2009. In March, 1983, prior to the first Dublin Pride parade, a march was held from the city centre of Dublin to Fairview Park. This was in response to the murder of Declan Flynn and the resulting trial. Fairview Park was built on reclaimed land. It was temporarily reduced in size during the 2000s, due to the development of the Dublin Port Tunnel, the entrance to which is just beyond the old park perimeter. The park has now been restored. It contains two small playgrounds and a larger playground which includes a skate park. The park also contains a band stand. The park contains several association football pitches. Both Sheriff Y.C. and Belvedere www.belvederefc.com play home games in the park. A smaller park, Bram Stoker Park, named after the author of Dracula, is located in front of the Georgian terrace of Marino Crescent; both the park and the street are in a pocket of neighbouring Clontarf. Stoker was born in number 15 Marino Crescent.

Top left - PR3 antibodies on ethanol-fixed neutrophils (c-ANCA pattern). Bottom left - PR3 antibodies on formalin-fixed neutrophils(c-ANCA pattern). Top right - MPO antibodies on ethanol-fixed neutrophils (p-ANCA pattern). Bottom right - MPO antibodies on formalin-fixed neutrophils (c-ANCA pattern).(FITC conjugate) Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are a group of autoantibodies, mainly of the IgG type, against antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes (the most common type of white blood cell) and monocytes. They are detected as a blood test in a number of autoimmune disorders, but are particularly associated with systemic vasculitis, so called ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV). ==ANCA IF patterns== Immunofluorescence (IF) on ethanol- fixed neutrophils is used to detect ANCA, although formalin-fixed neutrophils may be used to help differentiate ANCA patterns. ANCA can be divided into four patterns when visualised by IF; cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA), C-ANCA (atypical), perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) and atypical ANCA (a-ANCA), also known as x-ANCA. c-ANCA shows cytoplasmic granular fluorescence with central interlobular accentuation. C-ANCA (atypical) shows cytoplasmic staining that is usually uniform and has no interlobular accentuation. p-ANCA has three subtypes, classical p-ANCA, p-ANCA without nuclear extension and granulocyte specific- antinuclear antibody (GS-ANA). Classical p-ANCA shows perinuclear staining with nuclear extension, p-ANCA without nuclear extension has perinuclear staining without nuclear extension and GS-ANA shows nuclear staining on granulocytes only. a-ANCA often shows combinations of both cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining. ==ANCA antigens== The c-ANCA antigen is specifically proteinase 3 (PR3). p-ANCA antigens include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and bacterial permeability increasing factor Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). Other antigens exist for c-ANCA (atypical), however many are as yet unknown. Classical p-ANCA occurs with antibodies directed to MPO. p-ANCA without nuclear extension occurs with antibodies to BPI, cathepsin G, elastase, lactoferrin and lysozyme. GS-ANA are antibodies directed to granulocyte specific nuclear antigens. Atypical ANCA are thought to be antigens similar to that of the p-ANCAs, however may occur due to differences in neutrophil processing. Other less common antigens include HMG1 (p-ANCA pattern), HMG2 (p-ANCA pattern), alpha enolase (p and c-ANCA pattern), catalase (p and c-ANCA pattern), beta glucuronidase (p-ANCA pattern), azurocidin (p and c-ANCA pattern), actin (p and a-ANCA) and h-lamp-2 (c-ANCA). ==ELISA== Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used in diagnostic laboratories to detect ANCAs. Although IF can be used to screen for many ANCAs, ELISA is used to detect antibodies to individual antigens. The most common antigens used on an ELISA microtitre plate are MPO and PR3, which are usually tested for after a positive IF test. ==Development== It is poorly understood how ANCA are developed, although several hypotheses have been suggested. There is probably a genetic contribution, particularly in genes controlling the level of immune response – although genetic susceptibility is likely to be linked to an environmental factor, some possible factors including vaccination or exposure to silicates. Two possible mechanisms of ANCA development are postulated, although neither of these theories answers the question of how the different ANCA specificities are developed, and there is much research still being undertaken on the development of ANCA. ===Theory of molecular mimicry=== Microbial superantigens are molecules expressed by bacteria and other microorganisms that have the power to stimulate a strong immune response by activation of T-cells. These molecules generally have regions that resemble self-antigens that promote a residual autoimmune response – this is the theory of molecular mimicry. Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens have been characterized in autoimmune diseases – the classical example in post group A streptococcal rheumatic heart disease, where there is similarity between M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes to cardiac myosin and laminin. It has also been shown that up to 70% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are chronic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, with carriers having an eight times increased risk of relapse. This would therefore be considered a type II hypersensitivity reaction. ===Theory of defective apoptosis=== Neutrophil apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is vital in controlling the duration of the early inflammatory response, thus restricting damage to tissues by the neutrophils. ANCA may be developed either via ineffective apoptosis or ineffective removal of apoptotic cell fragments, leading to the exposure of the immune system to molecules normally sequestered inside the cells. This theory solves the paradox of how it could be possible for antibodies to be raised against the intracellular antigenic targets of ANCA. ==Role in disease== ===Disease associations=== ANCAs are associated with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, primary pauci- immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis and rheumatoid arthritis (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug- induced vasculitis, autoimmune liver disease, drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced systemic vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The ANCA‐positive rate is much higher in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus than in healthy individuals. Levamisole, which is a common adulterant of cocaine, can cause an ANCA positive vasculitis. The presence or absence of ANCA cannot indicate presence or absence of disease and results are correlated with clinical features. The association of ANCA and disease activity remains controversial; however, the reappearance of ANCA after treatment can indicate a relapse. ===Pathogenesis=== Although the pathogenic role of ANCA is still controversial, in vitro and animal models support the idea that the antibodies have a direct pathological role in the formation of small vessel vasculitides. MPO and PR3 specific ANCA can activate neutrophils and monocytes through their Fc and Fab'2 receptors, which can be enhanced by cytokines which cause neutrophils to display MPO and PR3 on their surface. Aberrant glycosylation of the MPO and PR3 specific ANCA enhances their ability to interact with activating Fc receptors on neutrophils. The activated neutrophils can then adhere to endothelial cells where degranulation occurs. This releases free oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes, resulting in damage to the endothelium via the induction of necrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, neutrophils release chemoattractive signalling molecules that recruit more neutrophils to the endothelium, acting as a positive feedback loop. Animal models have shown that MPO antibodies can induce necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis. In these animal models the formation of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in the absence of T-cells, however neutrophils must be present. Although ANCA titres have been noted to have limited correlation with disease activity, except for kidney disease, and with risk of relapse, this is explained by differences in the epitopes and affinity of ANCAs. ANCAs induce excess activation of neutrophils, resulting in the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which cause damage to small blood vessels. In addition, in patients with active disease, treated with Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody which remove circulating B-cells, clinical remission correlates more to the decreasing number of circulating B-cells than decrease in ANCA titre, which in some patient does not change during treatment. The same study found that clinical relapse in some patients were in association with the return of circulating B-cells. Based on the above observations and that ANCA reactive B-cells can be found in circulation in patients with AAV, an alternative hypothesis have been proposed assigning a direct pathogenic role of these cells, whereby activated neutrophils and ANCA- reactive B-cells engage in intercellular cross-talk, which leads not only to neutrophil degranulation and inflammation but also to the proliferation and differentiation of ANCA-reactive B-cells. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested. ==History== ANCAs were originally described in Davies et al. in 1982 in segmental necrotising glomerulonephritis. The Second International ANCA Workshop, held in The Netherlands in May 1989, fixed the nomenclature on perinuclear vs. cytoplasmic patterns, and the antigens MPO and PR3 were discovered in 1988 and 1989, respectively. International ANCA Workshops have been carried out every two years. ==References== 1 ==External links== *images of pANCA and cANCA *fluorescence images of ANCA * Category:Autoantibodies Category:Blood tests Category:Chemical pathology ","title":"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody"},{"id":"1438134","text":"Genes Reunited, originally known as Genes Connected, is a genealogy website that was launched in the UK in 2003 as a sister-site to Friends Reunited.Phil Inman, Sean Dodson (29 April 2004) \\"Genes reunited\\", The Guardian.

KFJC's over- the-air broadcast is 24/7 and can be heard within the southern San Francisco Bay Area. KFJC's mission is to be a conduit for new and interesting audio art and information. KFJC's music programming is largely oriented to recent material from many different genres. Most programs must play at least 35% (by song count) tracks from material added in the last 8 weeks. The station is licensed to the trustees of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District and operated as a teaching laboratory for the Fine Arts and Communications Department of Foothill College. KFJC, as a community radio station, is almost entirely funded by listener contributions. The cost of running the station, which is staffed entirely by volunteers, is approximately $100,000 per year. KFJC does have some financial underwriting from local businesses which provides the station. KFJC's 300-watt transmitter is located on Black Mountain, in the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, south of Los Altos, California. __TOC__ ==History== ===1959–1970=== KFJC signed on October 20, 1959, broadcasting from a broom closet at the old Foothill Junior College campus in Mountain View. The station broadcast from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday, playing \\"study music\\" and pre-recorded educational materials. In 1961, Foothills Junior College and KFJC moved to their current location in Los Altos Hills; the station also moved from 88.5 to 89.7 MHz. In 1965, the first rock and roll record was played on KFJC, causing the DJ Woody Muff to be reprimanded shortly after. The next year, however, Woody was rewarded; on April 2, the first rock and roll show was allowed to run on KFJC. It did not last a year, however, before it was forced off the air by more conservative staff members. By 1968, KFJC numbered 100 staff volunteers and was broadcasting from noon to 9:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Rock and roll was making more frequent appearances on the station. In 1970, KFJC hosted an open mike session during a nationwide student strike that had also shut down the Foothill College campus. ===1971–1985=== In 1974, KFJC began broadcasting in stereo after 15 years of mono FM broadcast. In the early 1970s, KFJC was a randomly block-formatted station, playing mainly bubblegum top 40, specialty/ethnic, or progressive rock, depending on the disc-jockey. Airshifts were assigned by the program director, but the schedule was not strict i.e. the station would sign off and on depending on whether the DJ showed up. Record service consisted of a smattering of 45s sent from a few of the major record labels. In 1973 several of the progressive-rock oriented students became very involved and vowed to clean up the lax formatting. Throughout these years KFJC was run by students who were in a 2-year broadcasting program. After 2 years in the program, the student was obliged to \\"move on\\" to make room for incoming students. Approximately 80 new students signed up for the on-air class every year during this time. The program director and music director maintained a mostly Progressive-Rock format, using a \\"clock\\" showing when on-air breaks were to be taken and what announcements were to occur during those breaks i.e. The Entertainment Calendar, PSAs, or promos for the many station benefits that the staff organized. The clock gave students the feel for what professional stations would ask them to follow. The program director and music director collaborated to create a playlist which was sent to the record companies (just as the professional stations did). This enabled KFJC to get great album service from all of the major and minor record labels for the first time. A system of noting time and date that songs were played was put into use to avoid over-playing the same songs. The playlist that was sent to the record labels was derived from these notations. Several ethnic and specialty shows were also part of the programming during these years. Emphasis was put on developing a good sound—good enough to take listeners away from the professional stations (mainly KOME, KSJO, and KSAN). Jocks were encouraged to play songs and groups that were being exclusively played on KFJC. According to surveys conducted by KOME, KFJC had quite a following during the 1973-1975 era. The great enthusiasm generated by being part of KFJC successfully spawned a number of professionals directly from its airwaves. Jona Denz was hired as a disc jockey on KOME while still holding the KFJC Station Manager position. Wendy Hoag also joined KOME. Mike Danberger joined KARA. Chris Holt went straight to KEZR's engineering department. Former KFJC Station Manager Wade Axell went directly to KGO as a producer then bought his own station. Program Director Terry Gillingham was hired as an announcer on KEZR and eventually bought his own station. Another P.D., Gary Lee Fazekas, took a job at KFMR and was joined by yet another P.D., Ken Mensing. Steve Urbani, Steve Burrell, Tom Evans, and Judy Wasson started a station in San Luis Obispo. Kathy Roddy and Karl Jay Hess became popular at KFAT. Tom Creed (Jack Flash) went on to KXRX. Ted Brooks took a job as a studio producer. Mike Martin became KSAN's librarian. Joe Eick took a job at KFRC. Public affairs director John Kotter was hired by KLOK and KBAY to become production and program manager. Rock Dibble joined Capitol Records. Peter Napoli was hired by a radio station in Santa Monica as music director. Tony Mercurio was hired at a station out of town. Todd E Daniels was hired to work in the production department at KXRX. Hawkeye Joe Scott went to KXRX, KLIV then KLRB-Monterey, \\"Alice\\", and still works in radio. Ric Curtice went to KOME as an on-air personality and then on to MCA Records. Kevin Ariente got a job at KXRX as board op/talk show producer. Janie Freeman got a job at KPEN. Sandy Althaus became (and still is) an on-air personality at KQED-FM. Kerry Loewen was hired by KSJO as host of the \\"Modern Humans\\". Loewen was succeeded by Teresa \\"Trash\\" Heinrich at KSJO. Quarter after quarter, radio stations hired members of KFJC to paying jobs. Bryce Canyon went on to work on \\"Early Tremors\\" with Belle Nolan and Frank Andrick on San Francisco's new wave station \\"The Quake\\" and wrote numerous articles for several Bay area publications. The format clock eventually became very tight, with an ensuing restricted sound. In late 1978, five student managers decided to restore the music format to again include punk/new- wave—this time, emphasizing the genre. They voted out the General Manager, John Low. DJs were now encouraged to play \\"alternate\\" tracks from bands like the Ramones, Elvis Costello, the Knack, and the Clash, i.e., songs that weren't being played by the professional stations (KSJO, KOME, and KSAN). Influential players during this phase were General Manager Kerry Loewen, Music Director Bob Gibson, Program Director Robert \\"Quasimoto\\" Zepernick, News Director Teresa \\"Trash\\" Heinrich, Kevin \\"LION!\\" Hardiman, Todd E. Daniels, Boris Darling, Frankie Carbuncle, Bob \\"Bob Doll\\" Gaynor, Leslie \\"Chris Gray\\" Smith, Scott \\"Gideon Baxter\\" Sanderson, Kevin \\"Grranimal\\" Ariente, Ric (Sky) Curtice, Bryce \\"Mark Elliot\\" Canyon, Rabbi Fächman, Cubby Calcutta, Charles Hutchinson, Angstmaster Fast Max, Faulty Bagnose, Clive \\"Bongo\\" Fleishman, Elmo C. Esta, Anita \\"Know\\" Plep, Paul Kiely, Kelly Porter, Doc Pelzel and the Duck from Columbia. In 1980, KFJC upgraded its transmitter from 10 to 250 watts, expanding its broadcasting range. In 1981, KFJC started the annual tradition of the \\"Month of Mayhem\\", in which the month is filled with special programming from increased live mics to in-depth coverage of artists. At 6 p.m. on August 19, 1983, the station started playing variations of Louie Louie. The event, known as \\"Maximum Louie Louie\\", saw 823 versions of the song played over the course of 63 hours. The escapade was the result of a competition between Bay Area radio stations. It was covered by Bay Area media and featured in The Wall Street Journal. In 1984 the KFJC studios were enlarged and received a bathroom, much to the delight of the DJs. KFJC started to become a \\"major player\\" in the record industry, with several staffers going on to label/promo jobs. The yearly pilgrimages to the CMJ Convention in New York City started around this time, and the West Coast interlopers from \\"The Wave of The West\\" literally made their mark on the Big Apple, for example: when CBGB's closed, photos were taken for a tribute book, and over the ladies' room sink was the distinctive red, black and white triangle logo sticker, allegedly affixed there by former promotions director Tracie Jarosh (\\"Sarah Barhear/Nancy Sin\\"). In 1985, KFJC hosted the Inter-Collegiate Broadcasting System Convention at the newly refurbished St. Claire Hilton in San Jose, California. College radio students from the western portion of the United States, music industry representatives from across the States, and indie music fans from where ever the spirit moved them, converged upon the Southern Bay Area for this three-day event. Frank Zappa, due to illness, gave a memorable remote address to the attended audience during a live remote hook-up. Matt Heckert, from Survival Research Laboratories, gave a well received keynote address to a captive crowd at lunch. Afterwards, showing the intricacies of his homemade flamethrower device, Heckert inadvertently set off the newly installed fire suppression system in the hotel. Numerous bands performed during the I.B.S. convention for the attendees. KFJC 89.7 F.M. broadcast live the Saturday Night's performances of Southern California's Saccharine Trust, the legendary Camper Van Beethoven, and the heavily industry backed 28th Day. During the performance, David Lowry, the lead singer of Camper Van, was clearly heard berating the program coordinator of the show regarding the mix- up of who the headlining act would be. He was correct in his missive, but more importantly, the performances from all three artists were impressive. On an alternate stage, the band Tex And The Horseheads put on what was said by an attendee to be an inspiringly drunken performance. During the Sunday Matinee of the convention, two other bands performed in the cozy confines of the top floor of the newly rebuilt Hotel. The Muskrats of the Berkeley folk persuasion gave a resounding performance, marred only by the uncontrolled burning of one of their musical instruments: their washboard. Quite to the contrary of expectations, the band The Circle Jerks, led by Keith Morris, resplendent in their black tuxedos, put on a wonderfully sublime performance. The program coordinator for this successful event was Michael Davis, a recent convert to KFJC from the backwoods of KSCU 103.3 FM (The University Of Santa Clara). While he performed ably during this mission of coordinating the I.B.S. Convention, it was really Robert \\"Doc\\" Pelzel, and his well chosen crew, who did all of the heavy lifting of the task at hand. ===1986–2000=== Until the late 80's, the General Manager duties were handled mostly by Robert Zepernick, aka \\"Ransome Youth\\" (formerly \\"Quasimodo\\"). Jeff Cloninger won the GM election in 1984, but stepped down after accepting a job in the broadcast industry, and Zepernick took the station's helm again. He was succeeded by John Porter (\\"P. Boy\\"), and later by Music Director Doug Kelly (\\"Hank Stamper\\") from 1989 to 1991. In 1991, \\"Hawkeye Joe\\" Scott, who had held a variety of management positions (chief announcer, news/public affairs director, promotions director and 2 one-month stints for two different GMs as program director) was elected general manager, a position he held until 1993. He had left KFJC for commercial radio several times, but by his own admission, kept returning to KFJC \\"because there's no other radio station in the world where I can be this nutty and have this much fun!\\". Scott, who had wanted to be in radio ever since he was a boy, split his duties as G.M. and as the acerbic, Alex Bennett- bashing (and sometimes bibulous) morning host of \\"The Lose-Your-Breakfast Club\\". Scott's \\"loose cannon\\" style of management didn't necessarily sit well with all staff members, but he encouraged diversity, merriment & \\"happy chaos\\", and the listeners heard it. During that time, and into the next G.M.'s shift, KFJC was nominated for several Gavin \\"College Radio Station Of The Year\\" awards. KFJC also won a \\"Donahue\\" award from the SF Radio Coalition, and shared a Billboard \\"College Station of The Year\\" award, resulting in its first-ever live broadcast from the East Coast. KFJC also resumed live remote broadcasts from all sorts of locations, kicking off with a \\"Battle Of The Morning DJs\\". This consisted of an entire month of Don Harrison (\\"Mark Darms\\") and \\"Hawkeye Joe\\" trading off their respective Monday/Tuesday 6–10 am slots ('LYB Club' vs. 'Relish it!'). The re-inauguration of station live remotes was from the parking lot of a local underwriter, Olivari Donuts in Mountain View. Eventually, Scott's other duties as \\"Sunday Funnies\\" producer at KNEW, and promotions intern at KSAN, and other aspects of his personal life resulted in the end of his \\"reign of terror\\", as he later jokingly called it. In 1993, a new administration took over, under the leadership of Steve Taiclet (general manager from 1993 to 1996 and 2000 to 2004), and a series of major changes began. Annual on-air fund raisers were initiated in order to underwrite KFJC's basic needs and, more importantly, to fund many much needed technological improvements. As part of these annual on-air fund raisers, the \\"Penny Pitch\\" was born. During the \\"Penny Pitch,\\" KFJC staff go out into the community with live broadcasts and ask for spare pocket change. This is a chance to meet the faces behind the microphones and occasionally hear live bands. 1994 brought the first KFJC CD release, \\"Summer Surf.\\" This was the first in a long line of CDs created at KFJC issued during the annual fund-raiser. As a result of the technological improvements made possible by successful fund raisers, in 1996 KFJC went international, with live broadcasts from Brixton, England of live sets from Ascension, the Bevis Frond, Ramleh and the Shadow Ring over two weekends. In that year, KFJC also began streaming over the Internet. The 'lower' production studio was remodeled over the summer of 1996, with a custom-made desk replacing the original card table. KFJC's next international broadcasts occurred in 2000, when the staff went to Dunedin, New Zealand, for 6 nightly broadcasts of the \\"Dunedin Sound\\" showcase at the Otago Festival Of The Arts. These broadcasts featured performances by such legendary underground groups as the Clean, the Chills, the Dead C., Alastair Galbraith, the Renderers, Snapper, and the Verlaines. The following year, a double CD documenting these broadcasts was produced for the Station's annual fund raiser. ===2001–present=== As a result of continuing successful fund raisers, in 2002 and 2003 KFJC studios were upgraded again, bringing new equipment introducing digital broadcast mixers as well as a 24-track digital portable multitrack recording system. In 2004 KFJC celebrated 45 years on the air with an entire day of 45s being played on October 31. KFJC no longer focuses its efforts as being a training ground for students wishing to enter the broadcasting industry. Each show continues to have its own personality as determined by the DJ (with approval from the program director). DJs follow a moderately strict break clock and all shows (with the exception of certain \\"specialty shows\\") must play a minimum of 35% of their content from recently added material—known as the \\"current library\\". The exceptions to this policy are during \\"live mics\\" when bands play live at the station in an area affectionately known as \\"the pit\\", the occasional \\"Freak Week\\" of freeform programming, and the \\"Month of Mayhem\\" (May) when DJs are encouraged to come up with original programming focused on a band, a genre or another creative theme. KFJC celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009 hosting a number of events throughout the year. The station held a logo contest and featured the winner and runners up in a San Jose art gallery exhibition called Blowing Minds Since 1959. Former KFJC DJs also joined in to help celebrate their 50th anniversary as part of a DJs from the past series, featuring memorable past DJs such as Hairy Kari, Jack Soil, Reject Girl, Peggy O, JC Clone, and Daryl Licht. There are tentative plans to move the station to other facilities on the Foothill campus between 2012 and 2014. However, Foothill College has placed relocation of KFJC on very low priority in relation to other academic facilities, possibly because of recent educational budget cuts in California and other economic woes. ==Fundraising== KFJC is listener-sponsored and holds an annual fundraiser each October. They feature an annual CD, specialty T-shirts (which have featured designs by numerous famous underground artists such as Kozik, Robert Williams, and the Pizz, among others), hoodies, girlie shirts and other paraphernalia. ==References== ==External links== * *Maximum Louie Louie - Information on Maximum Louie Louie *David Plotnikoff, SJ Mercury News KFJC circa 1990 Category:Freeform radio stations FJC Category:Radio stations established in 1959 FJC Category:Mass media in San Jose, California ","title":"KFJC"},{"id":"1438154","text":"Captain Mohiuddin Jahangir () was an officer in the Pakistan Army and joined the Mukti Bahini during the 1971 Liberation War. He was born on 7 March 1949 in the village of Rahimgonj under Babugonj Upazila of Barisal district. He was an officer in Sector 7 of the Muktibahini. He was killed in an attempt to break through enemy defences on the bank of the Mahananda River. His initiative seriously undermined the Pakistani Army's resistance in the area; eventually the Muktibahini overcame and took the position from the Pakistan army. The main gate of Dhaka Cantonment, \\"Shaheed Jahangir Gate\\", is named in his honour. He was awarded the highest recognition of bravery in Bangladesh, Bir Sreshtho. ==Early life== Mohiuddin Jahangir Mohiuddin Jahangir was born on 7 March 1949 at Rahimganj, Babuganj upazila in Barisal district. His primary education was at the Patarchar Primary School in Muladi. He achieved scholarships in talent pool in his 5th and 8th grade. He passed his SSC examination from Muladi Mahbudjan High School in 1964. He finished his HSC from the Barisal BM College in 1966. In 1967 he enrolled at the department of Statistics at the University of Dhaka. On 5 October 1967 he joined the Pakistan Army as a cadet at the Pakistan Military Academy. After successfully completing his training with the 15th war course, Jahangir was commissioned in the Corps of Engineers. Later he was posted at 173 Engineer's Battalion in Multan. After working with the Battalion for six months, he was shifted to Military College of Engineering in Risalpur. After finishing the 13-month-long training he took bomb-disposal training. ==Involvement in the war== In 1971 Mohiuddin Jahangir was working at the construction field at Karakoram. On 10 June 1971, he took a few days leave and went back to Risalpur. A day later, he started towards the Sialkot border to reach India. He managed to cross the border and joined the Mukti Bahini at Mehdipur under Malda district in West Bengal. On 3 July, he became a captain of sector 7, Mohodipur . He was given the responsibility to fight at the Chapai Nawabganj border at Rajshahi district. In December he was ordered to take Chapai Nawabganj. On 14 December he died after being shot during a battle near Nawabganj. He was buried near Sona Mosque premises and later was posthumously declared \\"Bir Shrestho\\". ==Death== Tomb of Captain Mohiuddin Jahangir and Major Nazmul Huq In December Mohiuddin Jahangir was made the captain of a team in order to take control of Chapai Nawabganj from the Pakistanis. He set his camp at a place called Barghoria at the west of Nawabganj on 10 December. On 13 December Mohiuddin Jahangir divided his force into three groups in order to attack enemy camps at Chapai Nababganj and Rajshahi. One team, led by Lieutenant Rafiq, crossed Mohananda and proceeded towards Rohonpur-Nachole-Anupura and Nawabganj. The second team crossed the Mahananda River and marched towards the city. At this point Mohiuddin Jahangir failed to establish any advantage over the enemy, so he continued with his team and crossed Mahananda and camped at Rehaichar before dawn. He intended to destroy one of the light machine gun bunkers of the Pakistan Army and crawled towards it. He managed to get close to the bunker and threw a grenade, but was shot dead a bullet hit his forehead from another house roof. He was shot from a sniper rifle. He wore a green lungi & a gray genji & a gamcha around his wrist. Pakistani Soldiers didn't recognize him as an officer as he looked like an ordinary soldier. His code name was \\"Tiger\\". His fellow Comrades responded on the radio \\"Tiger is dead\\". He died at the battlefield in Rehaichar Moholla in Chapainawabganj town. He was buried in Choto Shona Mosque premises at Mehdipur where most of his activities had taken place during the war. Later he was announced Bir Shrestho. ==Legacy== Front view of Birsreshto Shaheed Jahangir Gate, Dhaka cantonment. This gate was named after Mohiuddin Jahangir.

He is the only member of Verkhovna Rada who was elected to parliament in eight elections (from 1990 until Zvyahilsky did not participate in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election).https://ukr.lb.ua/news/2019/07/23/432929_pershe_zasidannya_novoi_radi_vidkriie.html Being the First Vice-Prime Minister in the Cabinet of Kuchma, he served as an acting-Prime Minister from 22 September 1993 after Kuchma was elected the President of Ukraine. Zvyahilsky was the longest serving Prime Minister office (as acting) without being officially appointed to it. Zvyahilsky kept the appointement until Vitaly Masol was confirmed as the Prime Minister of Ukraine in June 1994. ==Biography== Zvyahilsky was born in the family of a serviceman on 20 February 1933. In 1956 he graduated from the Donetsk Industrial Institute as a mining engineer. After graduating Zvyahilsky worked at the mine #13 of the Soviet trust company \\"Kuibyshevugol\\" (Kuibyshev Coal) as a chief assistant, later as a chief of a coal precinct, chief engineer, director. In 1972 he wrote a thesis \\"Observation of regional technological schemes of mining fields in the development of thin inclined layers (in reference to the Donetsk-Makiivka region of Donetsk basin)\\" (Moscow Mining Institute) earning him academical title of a candidate of sciences. Later Zvyahilsky defended his doctorate on the subject \\"Geomechanical foundations of landslides of the earth surface above mines, which can be eliminated\\" (Institute of geotechnical mechanics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). Coincidentally, in early 1990s Ukraine suffered from the miners' strikes that led to the early presidential elections in 1994. From 1970 to 1979 Zvyahilsky worked at the Kuibyshev Mine Corporation of the Industrial Union \\"Donetskugol\\" (Donetsk Coal). In 1975 he was appointed a director of the company. From 1979 through 1992 Zvyahilsky was a director of Zasyadko coal mine of the Industrial Union \\"Donetskugol\\". The mine, which is known for its chronic accidents, became particularly famous in 2007 for the most deadly disaster in the mining history of Ukraine. In March 1990 as the member of the Communist Party of Soviet Union, Zvyahilsky was elected to the Parliament of Ukraine from the 112th electoral district. In November 1992 he was appointed the chairman of the city council and executive committee. In June 1993 Zvyahilsky was appointed to the Kuchma's Cabinet as the First Vice-Prime Minister. In March 1994 now as an independent Zvyahilsky was elected to the parliament from the 110th electoral district. In 1994 Zviahilskyi, being perceived affiliated with Leonid Kravchuk, was accused of having stolen some $20 million by Ukrainian President Kuchma during his term as acting Prime Minister and he fled to Israel in fear for his life.Big Business and Economic Development: Conglomerates and Economic Groups in Developing Countries and Transition Economies under Globalisation by Alex E.

In 2002 he was again elected to the parliament as a member of the Party of Regions. Zvyahilsky became a member of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament), representing the ruling Party of Regions, and owner of the Zasyadko coal mine in Donetsk.

Ruddy, Hal Needham and André Morgan based on a story by Robert S. Kachler. The film starred Barry Bostwick, Persis Khambatta, Michael Beck, Edward Mulhare, George Furth, Evan C. Kim, Ralph Wilcox, Robert Fuller and Henry Silva. The film was poorly received by critics, bombed at the box office and was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. ==Plot summary== The story involves two fictional countries, the peaceful Republic of Sardun and their aggressive neighbor Gamibia. Unable to defend themselves from a Gamibian incursion, Sardun sends Major Zara and General Byrne-White to ask the help of MegaForce – a secret army composed of international soldiers from throughout the western world, equipped with advanced weapons and vehicles. The MegaForce leader, Commander Ace Hunter, will lead a mission to destroy the Gamibian forces, which are led by his rival, and former military academy friend, Duke Gurerra. While Hunter composes an elaborate battle plan to destroy Gurerra's forces, Zara tries out to become a member of MegaForce. As she executes the various tests, Hunter's feelings of affection toward her grow. And while she passes the tests, he is unable to allow her to participate in their raid, because her presence, as an outsider, would disrupt the trust and familiarity of his force. Eventually, MegaForce successfully para-drops its attack vehicles into Gamibia and Hunter mounts his sneak attack against Gurerra's forces. Although they manage to destroy his base, they are told by General Byrne-White that Sardun has decided they will not be allowed to cross the border into their country because they consider MegaForce too dangerous a global organization. At the same time, Gurerra has set a trap for them at the team's only means of escape – a dry lake bed where the cargo planes will pick them up. Gurerra sends his tanks to secure the lake bed while Hunter comes up with a plan to attack Gurerra from behind by crossing over a mountain range the enemy tanks had turned their backs toward. The plan succeeds, and MegaForce manages to break through Gurerra's tanks, but one of MegaForce's cargo planes is damaged in the process. Having to abandon their high-tech vehicles (which they program to self-destruct), the team successfully makes it on foot to the last plane, except for Hunter. The commander, instead, makes his own dramatic escape on his motorcycle after it deploys airfoils and a rocket motor and catches up with the cargo plane in midair. Although he has lost the battle, Gurerra shows admiration for Hunter's cunning, and he gives his old friend a thumbs up. ==Cast== * Barry Bostwick as Ace Hunter * Michael Beck as Dallas * Persis Khambatta as Zara * Edward Mulhare as Byrne-White * George Furth as Professor Eggstrum * Henry Silva as Guerera * Mike Kulcsar as Ivan (credited as Michael Kulcsar) * Ralph Wilcox as Zac * Evan C. Kim as Suki (credited as Evan Kim) * Anthony Pena as Sixkiller (credited as Anthony Penya) * J. Víctor López as Lopez * Michael Carven as Anton ==Production== The film was part of a $50 million slate of film production from Golden Harvest studios aimed at breaking into the Western market. Other movies included High Road to China and The Protector. The director was Hal Needham who said: > It's like no other movie ever made before. And the machines we've built are > extraordinary. There's one other thing. Although there's a lot of action, > you don't see anyone get killed. I think people are beginning to get sick of > that kind of thing. What we've tried to do here is make an entertaining film > with some believable heroes the public can cheer for. Barry Bostwick was cast in the lead after the producers saw him on stage in The Pirates of Penzance in Los Angeles. Producer Al Ruddy said he and the director had talked to one other actor earlier in the development stage, when the script was more serious. However, then Ruddy \\"decided I didn't want to do another Dogs of War type movie. I wanted this to be more camp, more of a spoof, but still believable. Once we'd seen Barry we knew right away he was just right for the part.\\" It was the first time Bostwick had received top billing in a film. He signed a three-picture deal covering possible sequels. He kept the beard he wore for Penzance to \\"develop a particular look for this guy. That way if I want to do other pictures I can just shave it off to look different. Anyway it's dead right for this character.\\" \\"We use high technology weapons of the most advanced design\\", said Bostwick. \\"They're still on the drawing board but they will be in use by the time the movie is out a year later.\\" Bostwick claimed the Pentagon \\"tried to stop the movie\\" by withholding 40 army tanks needed for the bigger battle sequences because the movie's strike force \\"was very close to covert CIA strike forces still in existence.\\" \\"You know what's good about this film?\\" Bostwick later reflected. \\"It's plausible. We need an international force like this to keep the peace. I wouldn't mind betting that one day there's a real Megaforce operating somewhere in the world.\\" The film was shot on location in Nevada. It pioneered the use of Introvision, a system that allows actors to walk in and out of photographs instead of sets. It was used to create the headquarters for the private army. \\"It's an absolutely phenomenal system\\", said the film's producer, Al Ruddy of Introvision. \\"There's no way you can get the quality and the speed of delivery at this cost.\\" The cars and motorbikes were designed by William Fredrick, who worked on Hooper. He delivered them after eight months work and a cost of $1 million but they all actually worked. Hal Needham was injured during filming after falling off a motorbike, breaking several ribs and bruising himself. The film had no credited costume designer; all the clothes were designed by the toy company Mattel. ==Reception== The film was released during the summer of 1982 amid much competition. Early box office tracking was poor and it was felt the film would be overshadowed by Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior). The film is in the list of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/megaforce/ Hal Needham later described it as: > Kind of a version of James Bond done with a helluva lot of less budget and > no Roger Moore, but it was a high tech, good \\"right wing\\" film and I thought > it was kinda interesting. Those buggies that we built, they were dune > buggies and we revamped 'em a little bit, and put the weapons on 'em and all > that, and the military sent people out there to look at my weapons and my > vehicles and how they run, and how they handle...they were out there in the > desert with me for a week watching. And, if you go back and take a look at > Desert Storm, there's a pretty good resemblance to my vehicles. They were > pretty slick, pretty tricked out, and they had a helluva job putting those > together. Years later, Robert Fuller admitted to being less than fond of the picture. Needham later admitted that commercially the film \\"went right in the toilet. I thought I had the pulse of the country better than I did. I was going off Reagan's election and different things. Then the other thing is, I didn't make it high tech enough compared to the other things that were out.\\" Had the movie been more successful a sequel entitled Deeds Not Words was planned. Hal Needham said in an interview with Starlog Magazine that filming of the sequel was to have begun in September 1982, just months after the first movie's premiere. The sequel would have shifted to a tropical setting and was to have been filmed in the Virgin Islands.http://www.8-bitcentral.com/reviews/2600megaForce.htmlhttps://www.stinkermadness.com/episodes/entry/podcast- episodes/prelude-to- megaforcehttp://futurewarstories.blogspot.com/2019/09/military-sci-fi- oddities-megaforce-1982.html ==Soundtrack== An album was released on Boardwalk Records, with the theme song done by the group 707, which was released as a single reaching the mid level of the charts in the United States and Canada. The soundtrack was released on Compact Disc in 2011 by BSX Records.http://buysoundtrax.stores.yahoo.net/meorsobyjeim.html ==Merchandising== Mattel also produced a Vertibird and Hot Wheels play sets based on the MegaForce theme. A video game based on the film was released in 1982 on the Atari 2600. Its commercial featured Bryan Cranston.https://www.networkworld.com/article/2289837/data- center/109045-10-celebrity-cameos-in-classic-video-game-ads.html#slide2 ==In popular culture== In the DVD introduction to the season two South Park episode, \\"The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka\\", Trey Parker graphically describes Megaforce as if it were the plot for what the viewer is about to see. Matt Stone stops Parker mid-sentence and reminds him that he is describing the movie Megaforce and not their episode. A disappointed Parker remembers and says, \\"We should have done Megaforce, that was a sweet movie, we should have done that.\\" Their film Team America: World Police includes a number of apparent references to the film, including similar scenes of a flying motorcycle and an underground base where the hero meets various specialists. YouTube personality Matt Sloan (voice actor), of Blame Society Films, featured Megaforce on his series Welcome to the Basement. As a result, the infamous \\"thumb kiss\\" has become a recurring joke on the show, being referenced even in its current eighth season. ==References* Megaforce at the TCM Movie Database * Fan Site – MegaForce HQ Category:Fictional military organizations Category:1982 films Category:1980s science fiction action films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American films Category:Films shot in the Las Vegas Valley Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films directed by Hal Needham Category:Holography in films Category:Films adapted into video games ","title":"Megaforce"},{"id":"1438163","text":"Vitold Pavlovych Fokin (; born 25 October 1932 in Novomykolaivka, Novomykolaivka Raion, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast), the son of a teacher, was appointed first deputy prime minister of Ukraine in November 1991.

A rockoon (from rocket and balloon) is a solid fuel sounding rocket that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, is first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas- filled balloon, then separated from the balloon and ignited. This allows the rocket to achieve a higher altitude, as the rocket does not have to move under power through the lower and thicker layers of the atmosphere. The original concept was developed by Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S. F. Singer, and James A. Van Allen during the Aerobee rocket firing cruise of the U.S.S. Norton Sound on March 1, 1949. A serious disadvantage is that balloons cannot be steered, and consequently the location from which the rocket is launched can be uncertain. Therefore, a large area for the fall of the rocket is required for safety reasons. ==Early atmospheric research== Time magazine reported in 1959: \\"Van Allen's 'Rockoons' could not be fired in Iowa for fear that the spent rockets would strike an Iowan or his house.\\" So Van Allen convinced the U.S. Coast Guard to let him fire his rockoons from the icebreaker Eastwind that was bound for Greenland. \\"The first balloon rose properly to 70,000 ft., but the rocket hanging under it did not fire. The second Rockoon behaved in the same maddening way. On the theory that extreme cold at high altitude might have stopped the clockwork supposed to ignite the rockets, Van Allen heated cans of orange juice, snuggled them into the third Rockoon's gondola, and wrapped the whole business in insulation. The rocket fired.\\" James Van Allen holding (Loki) instrumented Rockoon, Credit: JPL The Office of Naval Research (USA ONR) used the Loki in some of its Rockoon launches, lofting the Loki to high altitudes on a helium balloon before firing, for upper atmosphere research. The first Rockoon launch of the Loki I occurred on Jul 1 1955 from shipboard off the coast of Greenland. During Jul- Oct 1955 instrumented Loki I and Deacon rockets were successfully balloon launched (Rockoons) from shipboard off the coast of Greenland in cosmic-ray studies by The University of Iowa research group. Army Ordnance supplied JPL- developed Loki rockets and ONR sponsored the project. The first attempt of the Deacon Rockoon on Aug 21 1952 06:25 GMT from the Arctic Ocean 80.1 N x 68.5 W was a failure. However, success came on Aug 9 1953 in the Atlantic Ocean, Launch Site 11 Launch Point 10 74.38 N x 71.93 W, at 05:54 GMT. This was quickly followed by another success on Aug 30 1953 20:46 GMT, at Atlantic Ocean Launch Site 11 Launch Point 13 53.13 N, 54.75 W. In September 1957, as part of the U.S. contributions for the International Geophysical Year, thirty- six Rockoons (balloon-launched rockets) were launched from Navy icebreaker U.S.S. Glacier in Atlantic, Pacific, and Antarctic areas ranging from 75° N. to 72° S. latitude, as part of the scientific program headed by James A. Van Allen and Lawrence J. Cahill of The University of Iowa. These were the first known upper atmosphere rocket soundings in the Antarctic area. Launched from IGY Rockoon Launch Site 2, Atlantic Ocean; Latitude: 0.83° N, Longitude: 0.99° W. ==Recent usage== More recently, the JP Aerospace company has developed and used rockoons as part of its space access plans. Additionally, Iowa State University, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Purdue University (Purdue Orbital) have started programs to develop rockoons and significant work has been recently done by Leo Aerospace based in Los Angeles and a Romanian space company, ARCASPACE.

Senator Stephen M. White failed to cave in to the pressure of railroad baron Collis Huntington and his congressional allies, which resulted in the Port of Los Angeles being located in San Pedro, instead of Santa Monica as Huntington had wanted. Los Angeles has no natural harbor, and in the 1880s, the rail line to its inadequate port at San Pedro was controlled by railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington. San Pedro had always been regarded as the natural spot for the harbor because the Palos Verdes Peninsula protects it from most heavy seas and gales. San Pedro grew slowly but steadily through the 1800s, along with the tiny community of Los Angeles 20 miles to the north. When his control over the port was threatened, Huntington planned a new port at Santa Monica built with federal money taken from San Pedro. He quietly purchased most of the Santa Monica waterfront. Early in 1892, he startled the populace of the region by starting to build his own harbor in Santa Monica, including a wharf stretching nine- tenths of a mile into the bay. He built the long wharf in Santa Monica to compete with the existing facilities at San Pedro. The Long Wharf (it was, in fact, the world's longest) became a tourist attraction. Sightseers would ride the old Jones rail line, now operated by Southern Pacific, to the beach to watch it taking shape. Then, from 1890, he attempted to obtain federal funds to improve the Santa Monica port. He wanted to impose a monopoly at the expense of the San Pedro port. He chose a site that would guarantee he would dominate the Santa Monica port. Los Angeles took Huntington to court over the issue. For two full days in June, 1896, Senator Stephen M. White took the Senate floor and delivered an indictment of the Southern Pacific's predatory policies, and offered an amendment to the bill stating that if Santa Monica were chosen, any other railroad could use its harbor for a reasonable fee. Huntington and Sen. Frye pleaded with White to withdraw his amendment, but White refused to budge. With the bill now beyond the control of the Commerce Committee, the full Senate quickly adopted the measure, including White's amendment. In March, 1897, another board of engineering experts made the final decision in favor of San Pedro. The Chamber won and made Los Angeles a \\"free\\" harbor, independent of the influence of the Southern Pacific Railroad. White was seen as a hero. Crowds cheered as his homebound train passed by, and a parade through Los Angeles was held in his honor. The staunchly Republican Los Angeles Times called the Democratic senator “the greatest man the state has produced in its half-century of existence,” and $25,000 was raised for a statue of White, which now overlooks the Port of Los Angeles. San Pedro Bay grew into one of the world's great ports and Santa Monica was transformed into a glamorous beach resort, with powerful impacts on the region's urban geography. A 16-mile strip of land, from Downtown Los Angeles to San Pedro and Wilmington, would soon be part of the City of Los Angeles. ==See also== *Stephen M.

Most recent reports have focused on corruption in climate change, the private sector, water and the judiciary.http://www.transparency.org/research/gcr In 2013, it is in its eleventh year of publication. It began in 2001 simply as a collection of research on global corruption. But, since 2003, has grown into a report dedicated to providing information and solutions to corruption in various areas. The forthcoming report focuses on corruption in education and will be released 1 October 2013.http://www.transparency.org/research/gcr/gcr_education ==Aim== Corruption is a global ethical and legal issue and is defined by Transparency International as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. The aim of the Global Corruption Report is to bring the matter of corruption to the attention of the world and aid in combating it. It is also designed as a tool to help policymakers and the public to change corrupt behaviour by providing guidelines and recommendations within the report. The Global Corruption Report uses various sources of information including experts and activists, as well as up to date research, in order to bring to the fore the recent developments in corruption. The report also addresses international and regional trends, highlights significant cases and uses the Bribe Payers Index and the Corruption Perceptions Index as empirical evidence of corruption. The report provides an assessment of corruption within more than 30 countries, as well as research findings and perspectives, and it is designed to be useful to a broad range of readers. This includes policymakers, journalists, educators, students as well as the general public. Each year the report focuses on a particular sector and examines the prevalence of corruption within that sector around the world. By focusing on one sector the report further underlines the seriousness of corruption and the need for change to be implemented. It also emphasises how corruption in that sector affects the people and economy of those affected countries. The report helps to expose what may be lacking in the policies of those nations and encourages them to put in place better policies and processes. In reviewing the policies related to one sector, this may further encourage policymakers to review other sectors and implement change throughout. ==Examples== In previous reports, the 2007 Global Corruption Report focused on judicial corruption and its effect on the justice system as a whole. It also assessed the pressures applied to judges and courts by politicians, society and economic conditions. The report reviewed where and why corruption in the judicial system is occurring. It also gave details on efforts to reduce judicial corruption as well as recommendations for judiciary participants to avoid and eradicate corruption in their own country. The 2007 report stressed the need for judicial systems to remain “clean” and maintain integrity, accountability and transparency. Only by doing so can the judiciary act without undue influence and ensure the basic human right to a fair trial is upheld. The 2006 Global Corruption Report focused on corruption in the health sector and how public money may be an enticement to corruption. It also discussed corruption in the pharmaceutical chain, as well as in hospital administration, while also highlighting the various forms that corruption takes in the health sector around the world. The report also offered perspectives on the people of countries affected by such corruption and the effect on their health. The 2005 Global Corruption Report focused on how corruption in the construction sector and post-conflict reconstruction undermines economic development. This report included a particular focus on Iraq and the rebuilding that was necessary after the war. The report also reviewed the economic cost and environmental effect of corruption within the construction industry. It covered financing of corruption with a specific look at multilateral development banks and export credit agencies world wide. The 2004 report focused on political corruption and how political and party finances play an influential role on the levels of corruption globally. The report examines the role of disclosure in the prevention of corruption in the political sector as well as discussing corporate contributions, vote buying and legal hurdles encountered by politicians. The Global Corruption Reports are not designed to merely emphasise the extent of corruption and how it affects processes. They also demonstrate how reforms and activism can help remedy a system tainted by corruption. The reports have a vast array of contributors giving perspectives from various points of view and levels of experience in dealing with corruption. This assists in maintaining objectivity throughout the report and ensures it does not just act as an advertisement for the interests of Transparency International in eradicating corruption. While it is clear throughout the reports that the underlying theme is to help stop corruption occurring in the world wide domain, the Global Corruption Reports are not just propaganda. ==Availability== All of the Global Corruption Reports from are available via download from the Transparency International website or by ordering from Transparency International. This allows anyone from around the world the ability to access the reports and ensures the latest research, developments and guidelines are available to the world at all times. By making the reports readily available it means that any individual in any part of the world can assess the state of corruption within their own country. This is the first step in bringing about change or encouraging countries to continue to operate in a corruption free environment.

She took part in fleet exercises off Central America from 5 February through 6 April 1923, returned to San Pedro on 10 April, and on 16 July was transferred, along with Division 9, to Pearl Harbor where for the next eight years she trained crews and developed submarine tactics. Departing San Diego on 5 January 1931 R-1 sailed for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, via the Panama Canal, arrived on 9 February and was decommissioned there on 1 May. ===1940-1946=== She was recommissioned in ordinary on 23 September 1940 at Groton, Connecticut, overhauled and commissioned in full on 16 October. R-1 got underway with Submarine Squadron 3, Division 42 on 10 December for the Panama Canal Zone. Stationed at Coco Solo for a year, she was reassigned to Division 31 in June 1941, ordered to New London in October for a refit, and transferred to Squadron 7\\\\. At New London on 7 December 1941, R-1 remained in the southern New England area for the first days of American participation in World War II. On 9 and 10 December she patrolled the sealanes leading to New England and on 11 December arrived at Bermuda, whence, with other SubRon 7 boats, she joined the hunt for U-boats preying on maritime traffic along the North American coast. Although limited in cruising range, the R-boats operating out of Ordnance Island, Bermuda continued their patrols through the Kriegsmarine submarine offensive of early 1942. In February, the submarines established a patrol line between Bermuda and Nantucket Island. On that patrol line, some northeast of Bermuda, R-1 (under command of Lieutenant James D. Grant) sighted and fired four torpedoes at the surfaced U-boat , and was credited with sinking the German submarine, although U-582 was in fact undamaged.Blair 2000, p. 541. R-1 continued patrols out of Bermuda until returning to New London on 20 July for upkeep and coastal patrols. At the end of September, she resumed operations out of Bermuda. Through November 1944 she rotated between Bermuda and New London and, at the latter, in December underwent an extensive conversion to enable her to participate in the development of ASW equipment and tactics. Emerging from the yard on 26 February 1945, she steamed to New York City on 28 February; then headed south to Florida for three weeks of operations off Port Everglades, Florida. In April, she returned to New London, then on to Casco Bay, Maine, for further ASW tests. Returning to the Thames River base on 29 June, she headed south again on 7 July and at mid-month reported for duty with the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida, where she served for the remainder of her career. R-1 decommissioned at Key West on 20 September 1945 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 November. Still at Key West awaiting disposal on 21 February 1946, the overage submarine sank in of water. Raised three days later, she was sold for scrap on 13 March 1946 to Macey O. Smith of Miami, Florida. ==See also== *Bride 13 (1920) == References == * * ==External links== * Category:United States R-class submarines Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Ships built in Quincy, Massachusetts Category:1918 ships ","title":"USS R-1 (SS-78)"},{"id":"1438172","text":" USS R-2 (SS-79) was an R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy.

From the spring of 1943 until the end of World War II, the R-boat shifted the emphasis of her anti-submarine warfare mission and concentrated on training destroyers and destroyer escorts in ASW tactics. She arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 6 September 1945, decommissioned on 14 September, and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October 1945. In September 1946 she was sold for scrap to John J. Duane of Quincy, Massachusetts. == References == * ==External links== * Category:United States R-class submarines Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Ships built in Quincy, Massachusetts Category:1919 ships ","title":"USS R-7 (SS-84)"},{"id":"1438180","text":" USS R-6 (SS-83) was an R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy.

She was launched on 1 March 1919 sponsored by Ms. Katherine Langdon Hill, and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 1 May 1919, with Lieutenant Commander Charles Milford Elder in command. ==1919-1931== After fitting out at Boston, R-6 reported to Submarine Division 9 (SubDiv 9) of the Atlantic Fleet at New London, Connecticut, on 16 September 1919. In early December, while anchored alongside the submarine tender and five other submarines, she was swept away by a gale and grounded on \\"Black Rock\\" at the entrance to the harbor at New London. Once aground, she radioed for help and two minesweepers tried to pull her off the rocks, but to no avail. She was later freed and returned to service. R-6 got underway on 4 December 1919 for Norfolk, Virginia, and winter exercises with her division in the Gulf of Mexico from 21 January-14 April 1920. She returned to New London on 18 May for four months of summer maneuvers, before sailing on 13 September for Norfolk and overhaul. R-6 being reconditioned in drydock after sinking in 1921. With SubDiv 9, R-6, given hull classification symbol \\"SS-83\\" in July 1920, was ordered to the Pacific on 11 April 1921; transited the Panama Canal on 28 May; and arrived on 30 June at her new base, San Pedro, California. Due to a malfunction in one of her torpedo tubes, she sank in San Pedro Harbor on 26 September, but was refloated on 13 October by the submarine and the minesweeper . From 26 February to 2 March 1923, R-6 was used by Twentieth Century-Fox in making the motion picture The Eleventh Hour. R-6 was transferred on 16 July 1923 to Hawaii where she remained for the next seven- and-a-half years engaged in training and operations with fleet units. R-6 was recalled to the Atlantic on 12 December 1930, transited the Panama Canal on 18 January 1931, and arrived on 9 February at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she decommissioned on 4 May 1931. ==1940-1946== Upon recommissioning at New London on 15 November 1940, R-6 was assigned to SubDiv 42 and departed on 10 December for the submarine base at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, where she remained until 16 June 1941. She was transferred to SubDiv 31 at Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, on 22 June and operated out of there until returning to New London on 8 October for a refit. The submarine next joined the anti-U-boat patrol operating roughly on a line between Nantucket, Massachusetts and Bermuda. Through 1942, she rotated between New London and Bermuda, conducting submerged periscope patrols by day and surface patrols at night to protect coastal traffic. From 1943-mid-1945, she was employed primarily in training destroyers and destroyer escorts in anti-submarine warfare. In August 1945, she moved south to Florida and operated in the Port Everglades, Florida-Key West, Florida, area. R-6 decommissioned at Key West on 27 September and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October. She was sold for scrap to Macey O. Scott, Miami, Florida, in March 1946. Between April and August the R-6 was involved in testing the United States version of the snorkel. The snorkel had been invented and perfected by the Dutch, and they had even offered the technology to the US Navy, but the offer was rejected. The Germans took the technology after invading Holland and incorporated it into their submarines late in World War II. This caught the eye of the US Navy and research was begun. The first US-made snorkel was tested using the USS R-6 in August 1945, operating out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. There is only one known set of photos of this installation and configuration.http://pigboats.com/subs/r-boats.html Once trials were complete the snorkel was removed. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:United States R-class submarines Category:World War II submarines of the United States Category:Ships built in Quincy, Massachusetts Category:1919 ships Category:United States submarine accidents Category:Maritime incidents in 1919 Category:Maritime incidents in 1921 ","title":"USS R-6 (SS-83)"},{"id":"1438181","text":" USS R-8 (SS-85) was an R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy.

Following several practice dives out of Coco Solo, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 January 1920 for drydock work at Balboa. Returning to Coco Solo, R-21 continued to refine her diving, approach, and torpedo tactics through the spring and summer. During two trips to Almirante Bay, 30 March-2 April and 17–20 May, she practiced with other units of the first division. R-21 under construction, 15 July 1918. Given hull classification symbol SS-98 in July, R-21 again transited the canal to Balboa 27 September for a month in drydock. Upon returning to Coco Solo, she was laid up for 11 months of extensive overhaul. She sailed north on 26 September 1921 via Guantanamo Bay, Key West, and New York City, arriving New London on 27 October. She sailed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 27 December for refitting. A successful test dive on 26 May 1922 meant that R-21 could return to New London. Through the spring and summer months she operated out of New London and Newport. The craft of Submarine Division 1 sailed from New London on 2 October 1922 for Coco Solo. R-21 served as flagship as the boats cruised via Hampton Roads and Guantanamo. After 11 days out, R-24 developed engine trouble and was temporarily taken under tow by R-21. The Cuba-bound steamer SS Bethore rendered assistance, and R-21 arrived at Coco Solo on 27 October. R-21 spent the rest of her active Navy days operating out of Coco Solo and undergoing repairs at Balboa. She sailed from Coco Solo for the last time 15 February 1923 in company with a tender, , and eight other submarines. Two days later R-21s engines malfunctioned and she was towed into Guantanamo by the tender.

He was born on 16 December 1947 in Hajipur village of Daulatikhan upazila under Bhola district. His father, Habibur Rahman was a Havilder. On 18 April 1971, Muhammad Mustafa was killed in a defensive battle against the Pakistan Army in Daruin village of Brahmanbaria. He was awarded the highest recognition of bravery of Bangladesh, Bir Sreshtho. ==Biography== Muhammad Mostafa was born in 1947 at the Poshchim Hajipur village under Daulatkhana upazila in Bhola district. His father was a Habildar in the army. Kamal had his education only up to second grade and spent most of childhood with his father at the Comilla Cantonment. On 16 December 1967, Kamal escaped from his house and joined the East Bengal Regiment. Mostafa Kamal was a well known boxer. During the mid March in 1971, he was transferred from Comilla Cantonment to the headquarters of the 4th East Bengal Regiment at Brahmanbaria. As the Bangladesh Liberation War started in 1971, East Bengal Regiment had taken the control of Brahmanbaria with three Defence bases at Aashuganj, Ujanishwar and Anderson lake. But Pakistani army continued attacking with their heavy artillery in these places. As a result, East Bengal Regiment retreated back to Aakhaura, Shangi Nagar and Daruin. 2nd Platoon was sent to Daruin to reinforce the troops. Mostafa Kamal was a soldier of this platoon. Major Shafayat Jamil verbally declared him as the Lance Naek and gave him the responsibility of leading a team. He died at Daruin on 18 April 1971 during a battle against the Pakistan Army. He was buried at Daruin. He was posthumously rewarded as \\"Bir Shrestho\\", the highest gallantry award in Bangladesh. A postage stamp was also published to pay respect to him. ==Battle of Doruin== Mausoleum of Mostafa Kamal Muhammad Mostafa was a Sepoy of the 4th East Bengal Regiment. At the start of March, the 4th Regiment was moved from Comilla Cantonment to Brahmanbaria. After the incidents of 25 March,the 4th Regiment successfully brought Brahmanbaria under control. Under the leadership of Major Shafayat Jamil, they revolted against the Pakistani officers and formed a defense Camp at Brahmanbaria. It continued fighting against the Pakistan Army and eventually arrived at Aakhaura. At Aakhaura, the 4th Regiment set their camp in Gangashagar and Talshahar. To avoid any unexpected attacks from the Pakistanis, the 2nd Platoon of the company \\"Alpha\\" was sent to Daruin village. Mostafa Kamal was one of the section commanders of 2nd Platoon. On 16 April, Pakistan Army started to approach towards the Regiment camp. They were coming over the railway of the Comilla-Aakhaura root. The regiment also reconciled their position at Daruin. They settled on their trenches near a pond. Mostafa Kamal took the rightmost position. On 17 April, Pakistanis opened fire. Major Shafayat Jamil strengthened his force by sending the 11th Platoon of company Delta to Daruin. At around 12 pm, the Pakistanis attacked from West. Another part of the Pakistan Army attacked Mukti Bahini from behind. As a result,the Regiment decided to retreat from Daruin. Mostafa Kamal took the responsibility of covering for his fellow fighters. Most of the fighters retreated to a safer position as Kamal relentlessly kept firing with his light machine gun. He kept on fighting until he ran out of bullets and was surrounded. He was bayoneted to death. He, along with 20 to 40 other Mukti Bahini soldiers, was killed in this battle. ==Legacy== In Kamalpur, a football stadium named Bir Sreshtho Shaheed Sipahi Mohammad Mostafa Kamal Stadium was named after him. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Bangladeshi military personnel Category:People killed in the Bangladesh Liberation War Category:Recipients of the Bir Sreshtho Category:Mukti Bahini personnel ","title":"Mostafa Kamal (Bir Sreshtho)"},{"id":"1438205","text":" USS R-27 (SS-104) was an R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine built for the United States Navy during World War I. ==Description== The R-boats built by Lake Torpedo Boat Company (R-21 through R-27) are sometimes considered a separate class from those of the other builders.

It is located at the coast of the Dvina Bay of the White Sea (the Summer Coast) northwest of the city of Severodvinsk. The Nyonoksa railway station is from Nyonoksa at the mostly military village of Sopka along the Northern Railway line from Severodvinsk. Nyonoksa is accessible by land vehicles only during the winter months when the nearby swampland freezes. == Missile testing site == Established in 1954 near Nyonoksa is “The State Central Navy Testing Range” () which is the main rocket launching site of the Soviet Navy and later the Russian Navy and is also called Nyonoksa. Since 1965 numerous rockets of the types R-27, R-29, R-39 Rif and R-39M were launched from Nyonoksa. These rockets were prototypes for the employment on missile submarines. The launching site is located in the mostly military settlement of Sopka (), which has a railroad station, hosts the military unit 09703, has a population similar to Nyonoksa of about 500, and is north of the selo of Nyonoksa. On 15 December 2015 at 11am, an accident during a missile launch test resulted in a block of flats in the mostly military village of Sopka, which is part of Nyonoksa, being hit by part of a rocket. A fire broke out, but all residents were evacuated in time. === 2019 explosion === On 8 August 2019 an explosion occurred at or near the test site killing five and injuring six (or three) people. The explosion was followed by a brief spike in radiation levels. According to Rosatom the explosion happened on a sea platform when a \\"liquid-propellant engine\\" was tested. The people who were killed worked on an \\"isotope power source\\" for the propulsion system. While Russian authorities did not disclose what the power source was intended for, some Russian media as well as U.S. President Donald Trump have linked the event to the development of the nuclear-powered cruise missile 9M730 Burevestnik, also known by its NATO reporting name as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall. ==Culture and recreation== Nyonoksa hosts 7 objects which are protected as cultural heritage monuments at the federal level. They are grouped in two ensembles. The Nyonokotsky Pogost is one of the few surviving triple wooden church ensembles, consisting of two churches (a bigger, unheated, church used in the summer, a smaller, heated church used in the winter) and a bell-tower. The Nyonoksa churches are the St. Nicholas Church (1763) and the Trinity Church (1727). Nyonoksa was also notable for salt production. Another ensemble, the salt production complex, is neglected since the Great Patriotic War (WWII). ==History== Neolithic settlements from 2000-1000 BC at Nyonoksa - Sopka () located from Nyonoksa were excavated in 1893. The city charter dates from 1397 under Novgorod and later Muscovy rule. The city was named Nyo from Old Scythian meaning \\"fast flowing river\\" and Oxa from Finno-Ugric tribes meaning \\"river\\" or \\"small stream\\". Another version claims that the settlement is named after a Finno-Ugric leader named Niyuksa Soake (). Salt production began during the 1000s and lasted until rich sources were discovered in the Urals during the 1800s which led to Nyonoksa's salt trade ending the early 1900s. In 1419 and 1445, Norwegian Vikings or Northmen sacked wealthy Nyonoksa. In 1553, an English ship the Edward Bonaventure in the Hugh Willoughby expedition and captained by Richard Chancellor and Clement Adams arrived during England's search for the Northern Sea Route to China and India and thus opened Russia under Czar Ivan IV to English merchants. The ship's captain and crew were taken to Czar Ivan IV while the ship was repaired. Following repairs Edward Bonaventure sailed for London in 1556 with the first Russian ambassador to England aboard, Osep Gregorovitch Napea, arriving in London in 1557. This began the formal diplomatic relations between England and Russia.

The advancing Indian Army and Mukti Bahini column finally captured the Dhalai Border Outpost due in large part to his efforts. He was posthumously awarded the Bir Sreshtho, the highest recognition of bravery in Bangladesh. The Dhalai post was eventually captured permanently by 3 companies (215 soldiers) of the Jat Regiment (2 JAT) of Indian Army and Mukti Bahini who defeated a battalion (800 soldiers) of 30th Frontier Force Rifles (30 FFR) of Pakistan Army.Maj Gen Randhir Singh, 2013, A Talent for War: The Military Biography of Lt Gen Sagat Singh.Battle of Dhalai: The Bangladesh Campaign 1971, Defence Journal. ==Background== Rahman was born on 2 February 1953 in Khardo Khalishpur village (Renamed Hamid Nagar) in Moheshpur thana of the Jhenaidah District. Hamidur Rahman Degree College was named in his honour. He was the eldest son of his family. During the Partition of India in 1947, his paternal properties fell in India. They crossed over the border and settled in the bordering area of Khorda Khalishpur of Jhenaidah. == Liberation war == Rahman joined East Bengal Regiment on 2 February 1971 and participated in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. During the war he made a significant contribution in capturing the Dhalai Border Outpost at Srimangal. Though the independence fighters came very close to the Border Outpost, it became very difficult to capture owing to the enemy machine gun which was continuously firing from the south-western corner of the Dhalai Border Outpost. On 28 October 1971, a battle was taking place between 1st East Bengal Regiment and 30 A Frontier Force Regiment in Dhalai of Sylhet. 125 members of the East Bengal Regiment decided to use grenades on the machine gun posts of the Pakistani army. Rahman took the responsibility of throwing grenades, and crawled through the hilly canals. He managed to throw two grenades before he was shot. Rahman jumped into the enemy machine gun post and engaged in hand- to-hand fighting with the two crews who were guarding the gun, and at one point neutralised the gun. Realizing the fact that the machine gun outpost was damaged, the EBR's approach towards the enemy captured their first line within a short period of time. After the capture of the Dhalai Border Outpost, members of the EBR found the dead body of Rahman. Rahman's efforts helped the East Bengal Regiment take the outpost. He was buried in Tripura in India. ===Reburial=== Grave On 27 October 2007, advisers of the Bangladeshi caretaker government decided to bring back his remains to Bangladesh and bury him besides Bir Shrestho Matiur Rahman. It is said that the last place he stood alive was about 20 feet away from the Pakistani bunker, either in a canal or where the memorial is (near the bunker). 10 December 2007 the remains of Rahman were brought back to Bangladesh and on 11 December 2007 he was buried again at Buddhijibi Koborsthan (Cemetery), Dhaka. Rahman was posthumously awarded the Bir Sreshtho, Bangladesh's highest award for valor, for his actions. ==Legacy== Bir Shreshtha Hamidur Rahman Stadium in Jhenaidah district is named after him. A ferry was named after him. A library and museum was built in his memory and the village he was born in, Khordo Khalishpur has been renamed Hamid Nagar.

In a 2002 interview, Levon Helm described the reasoning for recording an album of covers: \\"That was all we could do at the time. We couldn't get along—we all knew that fairness was a bunch of shit. We all knew we were getting screwed, so we couldn't sit down and create no more music. 'Up on Cripple Creek' and all that stuff was over—all that collaboration was over, and that type of song was all we could do.\\"Lopate, Mitch. \\"He Shall Be Levon...: The Band's Levon Helm Is Rocking Harder Than Ever With The Barnburners\\", GRITZ magazine, Fall 2002. The original idea had been to replicate the group's setlists of the mid-'60s when they had been known as Levon and the Hawks, playing clubs throughout Canada and the US. Of the ten tracks, only one, \\"Share Your Love (With Me)\\" had been performed by the group in the mid-'60s. The rest were merely tracks the group admired, two of them, \\"Holy Cow\\" and \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", chronologically coming after the group's club days.

Monier Monier-Williams proposes a different etymology in which the name means 'widely pervasive' and suggests that in its first appearances in Vedic texts it is a name for the dawn goddess. She was a celestial maiden in Indra's court and was considered the most beautiful of all the Apsaras. She is perennially youthful and infinitely charming but always elusive. She is a source as much of delight as of dolour. ==Origin== Narayana on the left and Nara on the right, Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh, ca. 5th century The Bhagvatam narrates the story of Urvashi. Once the revered sages Nara-narayana were meditating in the holy shrine of Badrinath Temple situated in the Himalayas. Indra, the king of the Gods, did not want the sage to acquire divine powers through meditation and sent two apsaras to distract him. The sage struck his thigh and created a woman so beautiful that Indra’s apsaras were left matchless. This was Urvaśī, named from ur, the Sanskrit word for thigh. After his meditation was complete the sage gifted Urvaśī to Indra, and she occupied the place of pride in Indra’s court.Tales from the Puranas By Mahesh Sharma, pp.60-62, Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.,The Goddess in India: The Five Faces of the Eternal Feminine By Devdutt Pattanaik, Published 2000, Inner Traditions / Bear & Company, 176 pages, p.66 ==In Ramayana== Urvashi in the Ramayana, seduced Vibhandaka and became the mother of Rishyasringa, who later played crucial role in birth of Rama and was married to Shanta, the elder sister of Rama. ==In Mahabharata== ===As Pururavas's wife=== Once Pururavas, founder of lunar dynasty, and Urvashi fell in love with each other. Pururavas asked her to become his wife, but she agreed on three conditions.https://www.blush.me/unwind/the-tragic-love-story-of-urvashi-an- apsara-and-king-pururavas-a-mortal The three conditions were: *He would protect her pet sheep *They would never see one another naked (apart from love making) *She would eat ghee only Pururavas agreed the conditions and they lived happily. Indra started missing Urvashi and he created circumstances where all the three conditions were broken. After all three conditions were broken, Urvashi returned to heaven which left Pururavas heartbroken. Urvashi used to come on earth and bore Pururavas many children, but they were not completely reunited. Their love story is found in the Rigveda and Shatapatha Brahmana too. Kalidasa's drama Vikramōrvaśīyam is about their love story with variations from the original texts. === Urvaśī's Curse === She is also mentioned in the Mahabharata, as the celestial dancer of Indra's palace. When Arjuna had come for obtaining weapons from his father, his eyes fall upon Urvaśī. Indra seeing this sent Chitrasena to address Urvasi to wait upon Arjuna. Hearing virtues of Arjuna, Urvasi was filled with desire. At twilight, she reached Arjuna's abode. As soon as Arjuna saw that beauty at night in her room in beautiful attire, from fear, respect, modesty and shyness he saluted her with closed eyes. She told Arjuna everything and also of her heart desire. But Arjuna refused, as considering her to his superior of old. He also mentioned that she was like his mother because of her past marriage to Pururavas.Urvashi and Arjuna by B P BanerjeeIn wrath she cursed Arjuna of destitute of manhood and scorned as a eunuch for a year.

According to United Nations, approximately US$200 million was embezzled by Lazarenko during 1996–97 from the government of Ukraine.Kravets, David. \\"Former Ukraine leader ordered to prison.\\" Associated Press, 25 August 2006, (Accessed: 4 November 2013 ==Early years== Pavlo Lazarenko was born in a village of Karpivka (Shyroke Raion) that is located just outside a former Inhulets city (today part of Kryvyi Rih) on 23 January 1953 in peasant family (gardener). In 1970 he worked as a driver in the kolkhoz \\"Zoria Komunizma\\" (Dawn of Communism) in Shyroke Raion. From May 1971 to June 1973 Lazarenko served in the Soviet Army on the border with Afghanistan. After that in 1973-1978 he studied at the Dnipropetrovsk State Agrarian University in Agronomic Department. ==Career== After graduating Lazarenko received a specialty of agronomist. From 1978 to 1983 he worked as agronomist, chief agronomist, and head of kolkhoz administration in the Kalinin kolkhoz, Novomoskovsk Raion. In 1984, Lazarenko was appointed a head of agricultural department of Tsarychanka Raion. From 1985 to 1987 he worked as a Communist party functionary in Tsarychanka Raion. In 1987-90 Lazarenko worked for the Communist Party of Dnipropetrovsk region in agricultural production and food industry sectors. In February 1990 he was elected a head of Agro-Industrial Complex of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In August 1991 Lazarenko was elected as the first deputy of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor office, while he also was appointed a director of the regional department of agriculture. In March 1992, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk appointed Lazarenko the representative of President of Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.Hometown might not vote for Tymoshenko, Kyiv Post (11 December 2009) Lazarenko's candidacy was nominated by the council of working groups conference of the Dnipropetrovsk State Agrarian University whose decision was supported by over 200 groups. Leonid Kuchma at that time was proposing another candidacy of Valeriy Pustovoitenko. Lazarenko stayed at the governor position until June 1994. Although he sided with incumbent Kravchuk in the 1994 elections (June–July), he managed to establish close ties with the election winner, Leonid Kuchma. Upon recommendation of the Prime Minister of Ukraine Yevhen Marchuk, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma appointed Pavlo Lazarenko the First Vice Prime Minister (in Energy Affairs)Rutland, 173 on 5 September 1995. As the government official in energy affairs, he was charged with a task of negotiating gas supplies with Russia and Turkmenistan. Already next year in 1996 Ukraine reported no debts to the Russian Gazprom (Gas Industries) for the first since its independence. In 1996 Lazarenko became Doctor of Economic Sciences. ==Prime minister== On 28 May 1996, Kuchma confirmed Lazarenko as the Prime Minister of Ukraine within the powers stipulated by the current \\"Constitutional Agreement\\". On 10 July 1996, less than two weeks after adopting a new Constitution of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada approved the appointment of prime-minister. On 16 July 1996 Lazarenko survived an attempt on his life when a bomb exploded near his blocked car en route from Kyiv to Boryspil airport.Kolomayets, Marta. \\"Lazarenko escapes assassination attempt.\\" Ukrainian Weekly, 21 July 1996, (Accessed: 25 August 2006) While in charge of the Cabinet, Lazarenko reportedly exercised control over many lucrative business projects and speculatively charged 50 percent of profits for his patronage. At that time, he maintained a close business relationship with Yulia Tymoshenko, then the CEO of Yedyni Energosystemy Ukrayiny (United Energy Systems of Ukraine), a monopoly that imported Russian natural gas.Annual Survey of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union 1997: The Challenge of Integration by Peter Rutland, M.E. Sharpe, 1998, / (page 174) Lazarenko was involved in a prolonged and bitter struggle for economic domination with the emerging \\"Donetsk clan\\" (an industrial group based in Donetsk). Some Ukrainian media indirectly accused Yevhen Shcherban, the leader of the Liberal Party of Ukraine, of the 1996 assassination attempt on Lazarenko.\\"Ukraine Tycoon Shot Dead.\\" The New York Times, 5 November 1996 (Accessed:26 August 2006) Conversely, others speculated that Shcherban's murder was a tit-for-tat order by the Prime Minister. He may have also plotted against Oleksandr Volkov, a close associate of President Kuchma. Reportedly, Volkov became aware of the planned assassination and made a phone call to Lazarenko threatening appropriate revenge. By mid-1997, Lazarenko had fallen out of favor with Kuchma, who suspected him of making plans to run for presidency in 1999. Kuchma later regretted Lazarenko's appointment as \\"my gravest mistake\\". Lazarenko, who had no previous record of serious illness, was unexpectedly hospitalized in late June 1997. It is speculated that he spent the two weeks of the leave for his supposed sickness in vain attempts to mend fences with Kuchma. Technically, under the Ukrainian labor code law, a hospitalized individual may not be terminated from his position. However, when his dismissal became imminent, Lazarenko resigned on 2 July 1997, on his own initiative. On 12 May 1998, he was elected to the parliament again from the N40 electoral district of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as part of Hromada opposition party. In parliament Lazarenko became a leader of the Hromada parliamentary faction. Hromada frequently sided with the Socialist parliamentary faction of Oleksandr Moroz. ==Imprisonments and trials== Lazarenko was detained in December 1998 on money-laundering charges as he crossed by car from France into Switzerland. He was released on bail a few weeks later after giving surety of three million dollars. Details of his arrest in Switzerland led to a political scandal in Ukraine as rumours spread about Lazarenko attempting to cross the Swiss border with a Panamanian passport. The public uproar was in part instigated by President Kuchma's administration, who pressed for Lazarenko's arrest. The Verkhovna Rada voted to waive Lazarenko's parliamentary immunity on 17 February 1999; however, Lazarenko fled the country on the eve of the parliamentary vote. He initially stopped in Greece but was detained in New York at JFK airport on 20 February 1999, on suspicion of illegally entering the United States. Lazarenko was reported to have a large amount of documents with him, including a Ukrainian diplomatic passport with an outdated U.S. visa, and he requested political asylum. Lazarenko was transferred to a jail in San Francisco, since his family owned a ranch in California. Ukrainian authorities requested his extradition in 2000, after charging him over the 1996 killing of Yevhen Shcherban and two attempts on the lives of high-ranking officials. The office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine also claimed that Lazarenko instigated the assassination of Vadym Hetman in late April 1998. In the United States, Lazarenko was put on trial for money-laundering, corruption, and fraud. Attorney Daniel Horowitz represented Lazarenko on charges arising out of his operation of the Ukrainian gas business, Doron Weinberg represented him regarding charges of extortion of a business partner. The judge dismissed more than half the charges, but allowed the remaining charges to be presented to the jury for decision. In late May 2004 a federal jury in San Francisco found him guilty of using his position to get rich through a series of business schemes; with Transparency International naming Lazarenko the eighth most corrupt political leader in recent history that the same year. In October 2005, Lazarenko stated his intention to return to Ukraine in order to run in the March 2006 parliamentary elections; however Lazarenko remained under house arrest at an undisclosed location on $86 million bail from June 2004 until August 2006 after being convicted by a twelve-member jury. Lazarenko was sentenced to 9 years in federal prison on 25 August 2006.\\" Former Ukraine PM is jailed in US.\\" BBC News, 25 August 2006 (Accessed: 26 August 2006) On 18 October 2006 an appeal stemming from Lazarenko's conviction (but not the appeal of the conviction) was heard by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which included former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Sandra Day O'Connor sitting by designation.United States v. Lazarenko, 476 F.3d 644, 644–5 (9th Cir. 2007), appeal dismissed, petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc denied. Lazarenko was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California.Former Ukraine prime minister's conviction upheld, by Carol J. Williams, Los Angeles Times, 11 April 2009. – Retrieved on 18 June 2009. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer cut Lazarenko's sentence from 108 to 97 months in prison on 19 November 2009. The court took into account that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had dismissed approximately half the counts he was convicted of, leaving convictions only for acts committed 17 years previously. In November 2009 Ukrainian Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko stated that if Lazarenko returns to Ukraine he will be detained as he is on the international wanted list.Lazarenko to be detained if he returns to Ukraine, says interior minister, Interfax-Ukraine (12 November 2009) He was imprisoned at FCI Terminal Island until 1 November 2012.Media: Lazarenko detained again due to uncertain status for staying in U.S., Kyiv Post (2 November 2012) Since then he applied for residency in the United States.PRESS: Lazarenko could be deported from U.S., Interfax-Ukraine (4 November 2013) According to Lazarenko's defense lawyer Viktor Chevhuz the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services will deal with this application by the end of 2013. According to Chevhuz this could lead to the demand to Lazarenko to leave the country within 72 hours with the right to fly anywhere; \\"Or a deportation to a country from which he arrived - Greece, because there is no extradition treaty with Ukraine\\". Chevhuz further expected Lazarenko to not return to Ukraine \\"as the criminal cases against him, which had been previously dropped, may be reopened\\". Immediately after his 1 November 2012 release the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine stated that as soon as Lazarenko would return to Ukraine he would be arrested; for his involvement in around 50 criminal cases. Lazarenko owns a luxurious mansion in Marin County, California Picasso piece worth $30,000 missing from Lazarenko mansion after Novato teen party. which was bought with money looted from the Ukrainian budget. In 2012, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Pshonka suspected the involvement of Lazarenko (with Yulia Tymoshenko) in the murder of Donetsk businessman Yevhen Shcherban and Alexander Momot in 1996, and the assassination of banker Vadym Hetman in 1998; Lazarenko has denied involvement in all these cases. Генпрокуратура перевіряє Тимошенко на причетність до ще одного вбивства, BBC Ukrainian (7 April 2012) ==Size of corruption== According to an official count by the United Nations, approximately $200,000,000 was looted by Lazarenko during 1996–1997 from the government of Ukraine. Lazarenko is reported to have abused his official authority as the Ukrainian Prime Minister to extort nearly 50 percent of businessman Peter Kiritchenko's $60 million in profits. Lazarenko then ordered him to assist in laundering the proceeds to accounts in Poland, Switzerland, Antigua, and eventually in the United States, where a shell company was used to conceal his property pucrchases. Kiritchenko pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of stolen property and agreed to testify against Lazarenko. In 1998, he made unlawful transfers of $2.3 million from one Dugsbery account at WestAmerica Bank, which can be traced back to Mr. Lazarenko's Lady Lake bank account in the Bahamas, to an account at Bank Boston Robertson Stevens. Both the funds in this account and those in a San Francisco EuroFed can be traced back to Lazarenko's CARPO-53 account, where he deposited funds from the Naukovy fraud and from his extortion of Mr. Kiritchenko's funds. In total, Lazarenko was found to have laundered over $15 million from his Swiss bank account which ultimately ended up in Kiritchenko's EuroFed accounts in San Francisco. A Geneve court in June 2000 tried and convicted in absentia Lazarenko for laundering $6.6 million in illicit proceeds. In a special investigative report conducted by Kelly Carr and Brian Grow, two Reuter's journalists, it is stated that Lazarenko \\"was once ranked the eighth-most corrupt official in the world by watchdog group Transparency International\\" and that \\"Court records submitted in Lazarenko's criminal case and documents from a separate civil lawsuit, as well as interviews with lawyers familiar with the matter, indicate Lazarenko controls a shelf company incorporated in Cheyenne that owns an estimated $72 million in real estate in Ukraine through other companies\\".Special Report – A little house of secrets on the Great Plains That shelf company, a special type of shell company, is named Capital Investments Group. He acquired majority of his illegal funds through his activities in the gas and energy sector of Ukraine, where he was Energy Minister in the mid-1990s. He was reported by Radio Free Europe to have been guilty of money laundering in the United States and has routinely been on Transparency International's lists of most corrupt officials. In the 2004 Global Corruption Report, Lazarenko made it into the list of the World's Most Corrupt Leaders. He was listed eighth and was said to have amassed between $114 million to $200 million. In 2013, US authorities confiscated his $6.75 million California mansion in connection with his money laundering conviction from a decade before. Authorities have also sanctioned the seizure of a Pablo Picasso lithograph he is rumored to possess. ==Personal life== Lazarenko was married to his wife Tamara (born 1954) and has one son and two daughters. Short bio, LIGA According to The Ukrainian Weekly; at the time of his arrest in December 1998 Lazarenko's wife and children were living in a mansion worth US$7 million in Novato, near San Francisco.

Ret.) Yevhen Kyrylovych Marchuk (), born on January 28, 1941, is a Ukrainian politician. During his career, Marchuk was prime minister of Ukraine, presidential candidate, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, and Defense Minister of Ukraine. Marchuk is affiliated with the Ukrainian Den newspaper, edited by his wife. He has been a general in the Army of Ukraine since March 23, 1994. == Biography == Yevhen Marchuk was born soon before World War II into a peasant family in Central Ukraine. In 1963, upon graduation from the Kirovohrad Pedagogical Institute, Marchuk was recruited by the KGB and steadily rose through the ranks of that organization. As an operative officer he served first in Kirovohrad Oblast, then in the republican KGB branch in Kyiv as an intelligence and secret service officer, for a total of 31 years of service. Marchuk has admitted specializing in secret police functions. However, he claims to have been a humane lawful agent, secretly protecting some Ukrainian dissidents from harsh persecution. In the early 1990s, Marchuk was one of the first high-level KGB officers who appeared to be loyal to the newly established Ukrainian independence and was one of the reformers of the Ukrainian Secret Service (later SBU) serving as the first Chief of SBU. At first he was appointed the Ukrainian SSR Minister of National Security and Defence. That position held no actual power since local KGB, militsiya, and the army were still subordinated to Moscow until 1991. The Soviet Union then collapsed, ending Marchuk’s service to the KGB, and he was able to participate fully in the Ukrainian independent government. He headed the SBU until 1994. After the 1994 parliamentary elections, Marchuk became head of the liberal Social Market Choice faction, whose members included former President Kravchuk.Donbas moves back onto the national stage at last, Kyiv Post (February 14, 2002) Marchuk was appointed the acting Prime minister of Ukraine on March 1, 1995, holding the position of the first vice- Premier Minister in the cabinet of Vitaliy Masol. He was later promoted to the position of the Premier Minister on June 8, 1995. He formed his cabinet, which was confirmed on July 3, 1995. After being elected to the Verkhovna Rada (December 1995), he resigned on May 27, 1996. Marchuk and Kravchuk became members of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united) before the 1998 elections.UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT FORMED ITS PERMANENT COMMITTEES, Embassy of Ukraine to the United States of America (July 21, 1998) From April to December 1998 he was the leader of the party. From July 1998 Marchuk headed a parliamentary committee in Social Policy and Labor.

He held various posts in the Ukrainian SSR, most notably the Head of the Council of Ministers, which is the equivalent of today's Prime Minister, from 1987 until late 1990, when he was forced to resign. He was later Prime Minister of Ukraine, confirmed in that post on 16 June 1994. He resigned from that post on 1 March 1995. ==Early life and career == Masol was born in the Chernihiv region of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 14 November 1928. He graduated in 1951 from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute with a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked as an engineer at the Novokramatorsk Machining Plant and rose to become the head of the technical department, the head of the mechanical shop and then the deputy chief engineer. In 1971, he was awarded a doctorate in technical science; his thesis was in regards to the fatigue strength of carbon steel used to manufacture ship propellers at the plant. == Political career == ===In the Soviet Union=== Masol was a member of the Communist Party of Ukraine. In 1972, he became deputy chairman of the state planning committee in Ukraine at the invitation of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Vladimir Shcherbitsky. Shcherbitsky had intended to make him deputy minister for oil but decided that there was a more urgent vacancy on the committee. Masol later became chair of the committee and a member of the commission in charge of decontamination following the Chernobyl disaster. Masol became Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers on 16 January 1979. He served as Head of the Council of Ministers (equivalent of today's Prime Minister) of the Ukrainian SSR from 1987 until 17 October 1990, when he was forced to resign and was replaced by Vitold Fokin.How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy by Anders Åslund, Peterson Institute for International Economics, 2009, Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1999, Routledge, 1998, (page 850) He was forced into resignation by Ukrainian student protests and hunger strikes known as the Revolution on Granite.

Masol was once again reinstated by President Leonid Kuchma. Masol was against most of Kuchma's reform plans and openly so; he sometimes mobilized the Verkhovna Rada against Kuchma. Masol resigned on 1 March 1995, but continued to attend meetings of the Verkhovna Rada. Masol's two periods in this office saw the beginnings of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the establishment of a new political system in Ukraine. ==Awards== During his public service, Vitaliy Masol received numerous civil and state awards and recognition, including the Order of Lenin (in both 1966 and 1986), the Order of the October Revolution (in 1971), the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (in 1978), the Order of the Badge of Honour (in 1960), the Order of Merit 3rd class (in 1997) and 1st Class (in 2008), the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise 5th Class (in 1998) and 4th Class (in 2003).Ukrainian Government Website ==Death== Masol died on September 21, 2018 in Kyiv, at the age of 89.Ex-Ukrainian PM Masol dies at 89, UNIAN (21 September 2018) The cause of death has not yet been revealed. ==References== Category:Government of Vitaliy Masol Category:1928 births Category:2018 deaths Category:People from Chernihiv Raion Category:Chairpersons of the Council of Ministers of Ukraine Category:Prime Ministers of Ukraine Category:Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union) politicians Category:Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine members Category:Directors of the State Planning Committee of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise Category:Chevaliers of the Order of Merit (Ukraine) Category:First convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Category:Second convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada Category:Ninth convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Category:Tenth convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Category:Eleventh convocation members of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic ","title":"Vitaliy Masol"},{"id":"1438242","text":"Ruhul Amin (; 1935–1971), was an engine room artificer in the Bangladesh Navy who was posthumously awarded the Bangladesh's highest bravery award, Bir Sreshtho, for his service during the Liberation War.

They are sometimes referred to as the Himachali languages (not to be confused with the Languages of Himachal Pradesh, some of which do not belong to this group). They are also often called simply Pahari, but this name is ambiguous as it used for other languages as well, including some other Northern Indo- Aryan languages of Uttarakhand and Nepal, as well as the Pahari of western Kashmir. == Languages == Pahari written in Takri Script The following lists the languages classified as belonging to Western Pahari, with the provisional grouping used in Glottolog 4.1: :Jaunsari :Nuclear Himachali: ::Hinduri ::Pahari Kinnauri ::Kullu Pahari ::Mahasu Pahari ::Sirmauri :Mandeali :Kangric-Chamealic-Bhattiyali: ::Chamealic: :::Bhadarwahi :::Churahi :::Bhattiyali :::Bilaspuri :::Chambeali :::Gaddi :::Pangwali ::Kangri-Dogri: :::Dogri :::Kangri These languages are a dialect chain, and neighbouring varieties may be mutually intelligible. Some Western Pahari languages have occasionally been regarded as dialects of either Dogri, Hindustani or Punjabi. Some Western Pahari languages, notably Dogri and Kangri, are tonal, like their close relative Punjabi but unlike most other Indic languages. Dogri has been an official language in India since 2003. A controversial theory, put forward by linguist Claus Peter Zoller, suggests that the Bangani language is closely related (or a part of) the Western Pahari languages, and has been misclassified as one of the Garhwali languages. ==Writing systems== If written at all, the Western Pahari languages typically employ the Devanagari script. In the past, some of these languages were written in the Takri script. It rapidly fell out of use after Independence, even though there have since been sporadic attempts to revive it. == Status == According to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), all of Western Pahari languages, except for Dogri, are under either definitely endangered or critically endangered category. None of these languages, except for Dogri, have any official status. The demand for the inclusion of 'Pahari (Himachali)' under the Eight Schedule of the Constitution, which is supposed to represent multiple Pahari languages of Himachal Pradesh, had been made in the year 2010 by the state's Vidhan Sabha. There has been no positive progress on this matter since then even when small organisations are taking upto themselves to save the language and demanding it. Due to political interest, the language is currently recorded as a dialect of Hindi, even when having a poor mutual intelligibility with it and having a higher mutual intelligibility with other recognised languages like Dogri. ==References== == Bibliography == * ==External links== *Map of Western Pahari languages from Grierson's early 20th-century Linguistic Survey of India * Himachali a effort by Himachal Pradesh State to form a Pahari language out of Western Pahari languages of the state.

After the preliminary training at the EPR camp at Chuadanga, Rouf went to West Pakistan to receive advanced training. He was appointed to Comilla after 6 months. ==Death== The East Bengal Regiment wanted to restrict the Pakistani Army from using the Rangamati-Mahalchari waterway. Thus, they camped at both of the Chengi Lakes at Burighat. Rouf was serving as a soldier in this company.

In the meantime Pakistanis surrounded the freedom fighters and managed to isolate nearly 100 of them. Rouf realised the threat to the entire company. So, he crawled forward to his trench and continuously fired towards the enemies with his automatic machine gun. As a result, the Pakistanis dragged their launches back to a safer place and resumed firing from there. Suddenly a mortar hit Rouf directly and he was immediately killed. Rouf's valiant effort helped his company to survive as his act saved nearly 150 soldiers of the Mukti Bahini on that day. ==Legacy== Bangladesh Rifles College was renamed Bir Shrestha Munshi Abdur Rouf Public College in Pilkhana in 2014.

The President and National Assembly are elected by the public, with elections organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI). ==Electoral history== Following World War II, French political reforms meant that Niger began to elect members to the French National Assembly. The first of these elections took place on 21 October 1945, with Niger and neighbouring French Sudan (now Mali) combined into a single constituency. Two MPs were elected using separate electoral colleges for French citizens and Africans. The next elections for the combined constituency held in June 1946. By the November 1946 elections, Niger had become a single-member seat, which was won by Hamani Diori of the Nigerien Progressive Party (PPN). A General Council was established in the same period and was first elected in December 1946 and January 1947.Dolf Sternberger, Bernhard Vogel, Dieter Nohlen & Klaus Landfried (1978) Die Wahl der Parlamente: Band II: Afrika, Zweiter Halbband, p1461 In 1948 Niger was given a second seat in the French National Assembly, which was filled in a by-election in June that year, with Georges Condat of the Union of Nigerien Independents and Sympathisers elected. French elections were held again in 1951, with both seats won by UNIS. The General Council was converted into the Territorial Assembly in 1952, with the first elections to the new body resulting in a victory for UNIS, which won all 35 Second College seats. The final French National Assembly election in Niger was held in 1956, with the PPN and an alliance of the Nigerien Action Bloc (BNA) and Nigerien Progressive Union (UPN) of Condat winning one seat each. The 1957 Territorial Assembly elections were won by Sawaba, which took 41 of the 60 seats. However, in early elections the following year, Sawaba was defeated by the Union for the Franco-African Community alliance, which included the PPN. Upon independence in 1960, the PPN became the sole legal party. The country's first presidential elections were held in September 1965, with Diori as the sole candidate. Parliamentary elections later in the year resulted in the PPN winning all 50 seats. Presidential and parliamentary elections in 1970 were held under the same system with the same result. A 1974 coup removed the PPN from power, and elections were not held again until 1989, when general elections were called, with the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD), established earlier in the year, as the sole party. Ali Saibou (who had been in power since 1987) was re-elected President, with the MNSD winning all 93 seats in the National Assembly. By 1993 other political parties had been legalised, and the first multi-party parliamentary elections were held in February 1993. The MNSD emerged as the largest party, but won only 29 of the 83 seats; opposition parties subsequently formed the Alliance of the Forces of Change, which had a parliamentary majority. In the presidential elections shortly afterwards, Mahamane Ousmane of the Democratic and Social Convention was elected in the second round, defeating Mamadou Tandja of the MNSD (who had received the most votes in the first round). Following a split in the AFC, early parliamentary elections were held in 1995 but did not significantly alter the makeup of the National Assembly. A coup in January 1996 led to presidential elections in July, in which coup leader Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara was elected. The National Union of Independents for Democratic Renewal, formed to support him, won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections later in the year amidst an opposition boycott. Another coup in 1999 led to general elections that year. Tandja was elected president and the MNSD emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly with 38 of the 83 seats. The 2004 elections saw Tandja re-elected and the MNSD remain the largest party. A 2009 referendum resulted in the constitution being suspended and presidential elections being delayed. The parliamentary elections went ahead, with an opposition boycott allowing the MNSD to win a majority. However, Tandja was removed from office in a 2010 coup and general elections were held in 2011, which saw Mahamadou Issoufou of the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) elected president and the PNDS become the largest party in the National Assembly. Issoufou was re-elected in 2016 general elections, with the second round of the presidential elections boycotted by the opposition. The PNDS made significant gains in the parliamentary elections, but failed to win a majority. ==Electoral system== The President is elected for a five-year term using the two-round system. The 171 members of the National Assembly are elected by three methods. The majority, 158, are elected from eight multi- member constituencies based on the seven regions and the Niamey metropolitan region; seats are allocated using the simple quotient and the highest averages method under proportional representation, and there is a 5% electoral threshold. A further eight members are elected from single-member constituencies to represent ethnic minorities, whilst five are elected from single-member constituencies to represent Nigeriens living abroad, with one constituency for each continent. The single member constituencies are elected on a first-past-the-post basis.Electoral system IPU ==Referendums== During the French colonial era, French citizens in Niger were able to vote in French referendums held in 1945, May 1946 and October 1946. In 1958 a constitutional referendum was held across the French colonial empire; rejection would result in immediate independence, whilst approval would result in the territory joining the French Community. In Niger the referendum was approved by 78% of voters. The next referendum was held in 1987 on a National Charter that would establish non-elective, consultative institutions at both national and local levels, with official results showing 99.6% voting in favour. A constitutional referendum two years later saw the new constitution approved by a similar margin. Another constitutional referendum in 1992, which proposed reintroducing multi-party democracy, was approved by 90% of voters. The 1996 coup led to a referendum that saw a new constitution approved by 92% of voters, whilst the 1999 coup resulted in another new constitution receive the approval of 90% of voters. A referendum in 2009 proposed suspending the constitution pending a rewrite, and was approved by 92.5% of voters, although it led to a constitutional crisis that resulted in another coup and another constitutional referendum in 2010, with 90% backing the new constitution. ==References== ==External links== *CENI *Niger African Elections Database *Niger Psephos ","title":"Elections in Niger"},{"id":"1438284","text":"Paulo Salim Maluf (; born September 3, 1931) is a Brazilian politician with a career spanning over four decades and many functions, including those of State Governor of São Paulo, Mayor of the City of São Paulo, Congressman and Presidential candidate.

At the time a self-acknowledged playboy with a taste for fast-racing sportscars,Cf. the self-congratulatory long interview to Tão Gomes Pinto, Ele : Maluf, trajetória da audácia , São Paulo: Ediouro, 2008, , page 21 Maluf entered professional politics thanks to his family's friendship with the then military president Artur da Costa e Silva, with whom he shared a common interest in Horse racing bets.John Tofik Karam, Another arabesque: Syrian-Lebanese ethnicity in neoliberal Brazil, Philadelphia: Temple Unioversity Press, 2007, , page 50 Banking on this friendship, he was to be appointed mayor of São Paulo in 1969, replacing the very popular Faria Lima. In a manner very similar to New York’s Robert Moses, he suspended the construction of the São Paulo Metro and built one of the most controversial constructions of Brazil: Costa e Silva elevated expressway, also known as Minhocão (“Big Earthworm” in Portuguese). This expressway is seen as responsible for the degradation of a great area of São Paulo’s downtown by placing a high-traffic elevated road in the middle of a residential area and is considered as the hallmark of the military dictatorship's – and Maluf's – authoritarian, road enhancementIvani Vassoler, Urban Brazil: visions, afflictions, and governance lessons.

São Paulo: Edusp, 2000, , page 2000 ==Unsuccessful Contender for the Presidency== Maluf with President João Figueiredo in the 1980s. In 1972, following his mayorship, he served as secretary of transport of the state of São Paulo. He would then dispute a convention of the dictatorship's ruling party, ARENA – which was supposed to be a rubber-stamping caucus aimed at choosing as official \\"candidate\\" to the state government the former governor Laudo Natel. Maluf, however, succeed in being appointed official candidateJosé Nêumanne Pinto, A República na Lama. São Paulo: 1992, pages 37/38 for the following indirect elections by the State Legislative – something he did by means of abundant personal (and generous) promises to the convention's membersThomas Skidmore, Brasil: De Castelo a Tancredo. Portuguese trans. of The Politics of Military Rule in Brazil, 1964–1985. São Paulo: Paz e Terra, 1988, pages 475/476 – being afterwards elected governor for the state of São Paulo in 1978. During his ensuing term (1979–1983), Maluf used his position for advertising his prospective candidacy to the Presidency in the forthcoming 1985 indirect elections, by means mostly of schemes such as donation of ambulances to impoverished municipalities in Northeastern Brazil, as well as decorating influential people with the State's chief decoration – having them flown to São Paulo free of charge and lodged in luxury hotels before the official decoration ceremony. He also spent wildly in public works, including in some schemes of doubtful validity, such as in an eventually failed plan to move the state's capital city.Skidmore, Brazil de Castelo a Tancredo, 476 It was because of such schemes that one of the most notable accusations of corruption against him emerged, concerning the oil company Paulipetro. This was a state company founded by Maluf during his tenure as governor with the purpose of digging the state for oil and which consumed around US$500 million whilst drilling 21 holes and finding nothing but a few pockets of natural gas and water. By then, Maluf had already fostered a reputation \\"for engaging in corrupt machine politics\\".Skidmore, Brazil de Castelo a Tancredo, 476; Ted George Goertzel, Fernando Henrique Cardoso: reinventing democracy in Brazil . Boulder: Lynne Riener, 1999, , page 88 In 1982, he was elected federal deputy with a then national record 672 629 votes and came to stand as the military's preferred presidential candidate for the 1985 presidential elections – the last to be held by means of an Electoral College – where he stood a good chance of winning. His overweening strategy, however, estranged him from most of the party bosses – the civilian caucus which had provided political support to the military dictatorship in the last twenty years. That caused his PDS party (as the current PP was known at the time) to splinter into the PFL, a move that made good the mutual alienation between the ruling military scheme and its civilian base,When the Minister of the Air Force called former PDS bigwig and former governor of Bahia Antônio Carlos Magalhães, a \\"traitor\\", for supporting Tancredo, Magalhães replied in an angry note stating that \\"a traitor is someone who supports a corrupt\\": cf. Skidmore, Brasil de Castelo a Tancredo, 485/486 something which resulted in the election of opposition candidate Tancredo Neves. ==Post-dictatorship career and political resilience== Maluf and fellow Progressive Party Federal Deputy Simão Sessim in 2007. Since then, Maluf only managed to get himself elected to the Executive once, in 1992, again as mayor of São Paulo, despite his participation in nearly every gubernatorial and mayoral election for São Paulo state and São Paulo city, with the exception of 1989 when he was a presidential candidate in the first direct presidential elections since 1960 – in what was a disastrous campaign, remembered in Brazilian political lore only because of Maluf's \\"antic\\", said at a speech made to Medical Faculty students in Belo Horizonte: declaring himself favourable to capital punishment in cases of rape followed by murder, he said jokingly that \\"if one has sexual urges, that's okay; rape, but do not kill!\\" (estupra mas não mata).Cf. Maurício Lara, Campanha de rua: a cobertura jornalística de uma eleição presidencial.São Paulo: Geração Editorial, 1994 pg.61. Available at Nevertheless, Maluf remained a regional political force in São Paulo, the election of Celso Pitta as São Paulo city mayor being directly attributed to his endorsement. When he ended his last mayoral term in 1996, he was considered the best mayor São Paulo had ever had up until then, receiving an 80% approval rate. In 2011, a survey by the Datafolha research firm, after asking, again, a sample of São Paulo locals about who would be the best mayor the city had ever had, obtained the result that Maluf stood first with 47% of the sample's preferences. Such high rates of local approval stand as a reflection of the fact that Maluf was able to forge himself a successful career in post-dictatorship Brazil, despite his perennial reputation for shady deals and for an unsavory personalityCf., among others, Emir Sader & Ken Silverstein,Without fear of being happy: Lula, the Workers Party and Brazil . London: Verso,1991, page 114; Ignacy Sachs, Jorge Wilheim & Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, eds., Brazil: A Century of Change .

Cambridge University Press, , page 262, available at This has led various scholars to try to explain his political resilience. To some, this resilience is of an ideological nature: having his career nurtured in a right-wing military dictatorship, Maluf came to stand for a kind of reactionary activism, especially strong among small businesspeople and the self-employed,Cf. Maurício Puls, O Malufismo, São Paulo, Publifolha, 2000, as abridged in Lawrence Boudon & Katherine D. McCann, Handbook of Latin American Studies: Social Sciences,59, Austin: University of Texas Press, 2003, , page 582 whose hallmark consisted \\"in the refusal to admit the social character of social problems\\", proposing instead a heavy-handed approach to them.Cf. Renato Janine Ribeiro, O afeto autoritário: televisão, ética e democracia . Cotia: Ateliê Editorial, 2004, , page 37. Available at In the words of the extreme-left political analyst Marilena Chaui, writing in the mid-1980s, malufismo stood for the privatization of political power: \\"a fringe form of the [military] dictatorship as it turned from raw force into mob rule\\".Marilena Chaui, \\"Maluf ou o Novo Corpo do Rei\\", Lua Nova, October–December 1984, available at ==Later life and money laundering indictments== However, one of the consequences of Pitta's disastrous administration in São Paulo, was that it left the São Paulo municipality mired in debt, as such drawing attention to Maluf's and his former protégé's management practices: in the words of a Brazilian professor at the end of Pitta's term, \\"Sao Paulo's corruption has been transformed into a public horror from the whispered-about horror it always was\\". That called eventually for judicial scrutiny of Maluf's policies, especially his public works, his relentless extension of \\"the city's [São Paulo's] unmitigating concrete sprawl\\".Both quotes taken from Simon Romero, \\"Sao Paulo Creaks Under Debt Crisis\\", The New York Times, April 15, 2000, One notable example of the allegations of corruption that surfaced around Maluf was the Ayrton Senna tunnel, which passes underneath Ibirapuera Park and cost more, per kilometer, than the Channel Tunnel (it is alleged that the tunnel cost over US$400 million more than it should). Under dispute is Maluf's personal wealth, which critics attribute to his involvement in corruption scandals; supporters, conversely, point to a legitimate origin of such wealth in his family's companies – namely the mamoooth plywood trust Eucatex. Maluf was also part of an extensive investigation, by a Parliamentary Inquiry Committee set up in 2003, regarding money laundering involving bank accounts held by him and his family in Jersey (one of the Channel Islands). He has been convicted of corruption multiple times, but only in 2001 was the sentence final, with no possibility of appeal. At the time, he was forced to pay approximately R$500.000 to the state. Many of his alleged crimes cannot be prosecuted, due to the nature of the Brazilian statute of limitations. Even if he were to be convicted, there would be serious questions about whether he would serve jail time, as he is over 70 years of age. In early September 2005, Paulo Maluf and his son Flávio Maluf were temporarily arrested by the Brazilian Federal police, under the charge of intimidating witnesses of an ongoing investigation. They were only incarcerated for a few weeks. So notorious is Maluf's reputation that in Brazil the verb malufar was created, meaning \\"to steal public money\\". This verb is also sometimes used outside Brazil, with one example being the French newspaper \\"Le Monde\\". In the 2006 elections, Maluf ran for a seat in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, being elected as the candidate for the federal legislature with a national record in terms of ballots cast personally for a candidate to the federal legislature in this particular election (739,837).The Brazilian proportional voting system for parliamentary elections admits ballots cast for a party as well as for a particular candidate to the legislature. Be it said that, although spectacular, Maluf's 2006 voting was roughly half of the greatest ever number of ballots received for a Brazilian congressional election, this record belonging so far to the 1,5 million votes received, in the preceding 2002 elections, by the late congressman - also for São Paulo - Enéas Carneiro. In relative terms, however, the greatest ever voting for a congressional candidacy still stands with the 269,000 ballots cast for Leonel Brizola by the defunct Guanabara State's electorate in the 1962 election, which comprised a third of all valid ballots. He was reelected again in 2010, with something around 497,000 ballots cast for him.\\"Ficha suja, Maluf tem 497 mil votos, mas não sabe se assumirá\\". UOL newssite, October 4, 2010, available at Retrieved May 2, 2012 His 2010 bid for reelection was fraught with legal doubts, as a recent federal statute (Complementary Law 135/2010, commonly known as Lei Ficha Limpa or \\"Clean Record Act\\") allowed electoral courts to refuse to register the candidacies of people already found guilty by a higher, collegiate court (possibility of further appeals notwithstanding); however, as the Brazilian STF decided in March 2011 that the \\"Clean Record Act\\" did not apply to the 2010 elections, according to the principle of anteriority (no offence being punished when defined by a non-previously existing law, and a Brazilian electoral law must be in force at least a year before the election is held),Cf. STF newssite all charges against Maluf's registration and subsequent office-taking were eventually dropped. During the 2014 elections, Maluf stood again as a congressional candidate, but his candidacy was this time denied acceptance by a 4-to-3 decision of the TSE.TSE site, . Retrieved October 16, 2014 Pending a recourse to the STF, Maluf was allowed to campaign and to receive ballots cast for him in October 5, 2014, but such votes are legally regarded as null until - and if - his candidacy is declared as lawful. Were this to happen, his 2014 voting would make him the eighth most voted candidate for the Federal Legislature in the State of São Paulo, with 246,446 ballots.\\"Barrado Pela Ficha Limpa, Paulo Maluf Tem Mais De 240 Mil Votos\\". Agencia Estadão, 5 October 2014, . Retrieved October 16, 2014 On March 9, 2007, Robert M. Morgenthau of the Manhattan's District Attorney's office issued an www.nytimes.com indictment against Paulo Maluf for money laundering in relation to a kickback and inflated invoice scheme that allegedly stole $11.6m from a Brazilian road contract project totaling $140 million. From November 1997 to May 1999 the money passed through an account at the Safra National Bank of New York and was secretly controlled by Maluf. This indictment was maintained by a New York judge on April 25, 2012, who dismissed a petition from the Malufs, Paulo and Flávio, who sought a court order to toss out the indictment.Karen Freifeld (Reuters), \\"New York judge refuses to dismiss Brazilian kickback case\\".Chicago Tribune, April 25, 2012, available at .

As this arrest warrant is not valid in Brazil because the Brazilian Constitution does not allow for the extradition of Brazilian citizens,Inclusion in the Red Notice of Interpol (in Portuguese) its practical meaning is that the Malufs are to be arrested if they travel outside Brazil. In addition, Maluf and his son Flávio were sentenced to three years in prison (along with a two-year sentence for his wife Sylvia) in France in 2016. On 20 December 2017, after being convicted of corruption by the Supreme Court of Brazil and after a few attempts to challenge that conviction by means of internal appeals within the Supreme Court, Maluf surrendered to Brazilian police, to begin his prison sentence as ordered. On 30 March 2018 he was released from prison under house arrest on humanitarian grounds, due to his advanced age and poor health. He currently remains under house arrest and, as ordered by the Brazilian Supreme Court, in August 2018 the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil officially declared that, as a result of his conviction, Maluf lost his Federal Deputy seat. ==References== - - - Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from São Paulo Category:Brazilian people of Lebanese descent Category:Brazilian people of Levantine-Eastern Orthodox Christian descent Category:Brazilian Roman Catholics Category:National Renewal Alliance politicians Category:Democratic Social Party politicians Category:Reform Progressive Party politicians Category:Progressistas politicians Category:Governors of São Paulo (state) Category:Mayors of São Paulo Category:University of São Paulo alumni Category:Brazilian politicians convicted of corruption Category:Candidates for President of Brazil ","title":"Paulo Maluf"},{"id":"1438292","text":"Herrerasauridae is a family of carnivorous basal saurischian dinosaurs. They are among the oldest known dinosaurs, first appearing in the fossil record around 233.23 million years ago (Late Triassic), before becoming extinct by the end of the Triassic period. Herrerasaurids were relatively small-sized dinosaurs, normally not more than long, although the holotype specimen of \\"Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis\\" (nowadays considered a synonym of Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis) is thought to have reached around 6 meters (20 ft) long. The best known representatives of this group are from South America (Brazil, Argentina), where they were first discovered in the 1930s in relation to Staurikosaurus and 1960s in relation to Herrerasaurus. A nearly complete skeleton of Herrerasaurus ischigulastensis was discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation in San Juan, Argentina, in 1988. Less complete possible herrerasaurids have been found in North America, and they may have inhabited other continents as well. Herrerasaurid anatomy is unusual and specialized, and they are not considered to be ancestral to any later dinosaur group. They only superficially resemble theropods and often present a mixture of very primitive and derived traits. The acetabulum is only partly open, and there are only two sacral vertebrae , the lowest number among dinosaurs. The pubic bone has a derived structure, being rotated somewhat posteriorly and folded to create a superficially tetanuran-like terminal expansion, especially prominent in H. ischigulastensis. The hand is primitive in having five metacarpals and the third finger longer than the second, but resembles those of theropods in having only three long fingers, with curved claws. Herrerasaurids also have a hinged mandible, which is also found in theropods. ==Classification== It is not clear where Herrerasaurids lie on the early dinosaur evolutionary tree. They are possibly basal theropods or basal saurischians but may predate the saurischian-ornithischian split. Early researchers even proposed that they represented an early lineage of sauropodomorphs. Some analyses, such as Nesbitt et al. 2009, have found Herrerasaurus and its relatives in Herrerasauridae to be very basal theropods, while others (such as Ezcurra 2010) have found them to be basal to the clade Eusaurischia, that is, closer to the base of the saurischian tree than either theropods or sauropodomorphs, but not true members of either. The situation is further complicated by uncertainties in correlating the ages of late Triassic beds bearing land animals. Other proposed members of the clade have included Sanjuansaurus from the Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina, Staurikosaurus and Gnathovorax from the Santa Maria Formation of southern Brazil, Chindesaurus from the Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and possibly Caseosaurus from the Dockum Formation of Texas, although the relationships of the North American animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Grzegorz Niedźwiedzki, Stephen L. Brusatte et al. (2014) described a European putative member of the group on the basis of Norian age fossils discovered in Poland. Other possible basal saurischians include Alwalkeria from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of southern India, and Teyuwasu (recently considered synonym of Staurikosaurus), known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil. The discovery of the Herrerasaurid Gnathovorax indicates that the family falls outside the Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha in the cladistic analysis undertaken on the genus when it was described, but remains squarely within Saurischia as basal members of the order.https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/laelaps/stunning- skeleton-reveals-early-carnivorous-dinosaur/https://peerj.com/articles/7963/ ===Phylogeny=== Fernando Novas (1992) defined Herrerasauridae as Herrerasaurus, Staurikosaurus, and their most recent common ancestor. Paul Sereno (1998) defined the group as the most inclusive clade including H. ischigualastensis but not Passer domesticus. Langer (2004) provided first phylogenetic definition of a higher level taxon, Herrerasauria, as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus. According to current phylogenetic studies, all of these definitions describe the same clade. The first cladogram presented follows one proposed analysis by Novas et al. in May 2011. In this review, Herrerasaurus is found to be a basal saurischian, but not a theropod. The second cladogram is based on an analysis by Sues et al. in April 2011. This review classified Herrerasaurus as a basal theropod. A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs by Matthew Baron, David Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) found Herrerasauridae within the clade Saurischia, as the sister group to Sauropodomorpha. This was the result of the removal of Theropoda from Saurischia and its placement next to Ornithischia within the newly created clade Ornithoscelida. Baron & Williams (2018) found Herrerasauria (including Saltopus and Caseosaurus) outside Dinosauria. A similar result was provided by the phylogenetic analysis by Cau, 2018: ==References== Category:Prehistoric reptile families Category:Prehistoric saurischians Category:Carnian first appearances Category:Norian extinctions ","title":"Herrerasauridae"},{"id":"1438295","text":"Honest John may refer to: ==Politicians== ===United Kingdom=== * John Battersby, councillor in Glasgow and trade union leader * John Bowen (alderman), High Sheriff of Worcestershire * John Fielden, British politician * Mad Jack Fuller, British politician who preferred to be known as \\"Honest John\\" Fuller *John Lilburne (1614 – 1657), English Leveller during the English Civil Wars ===United States=== * John Davis (Massachusetts governor) * John H.

Built by a congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1999. and ==History== The design of the US$1.25 million edifice is credited to two individuals: Adah Robinson and Bruce Goff. Robinson was an art teacher at Central High School in Tulsa, and eventually was chair of the art department in the University of Tulsa. Robinson sketched the original ideas for the church. Bruce Goff, formerly one of her high school students, and the architect in 1924–1926 of her home and studio, then took the sketches and came up with the design for the church. Officially, the architecture firm credited is Rush, Endacott and Rush where Goff apprenticed (from age 12 and became a partner in 1930). There is still some debate over who was more responsible for the building. The church credits Adah Robinson with the design of this building, while Goff experts maintain that it is clearly his design. The definitive book on the subject, Tulsa Art Deco [see References, below] says of that issue that \\"it is not the purpose of this book to offer a resolution to that controversy.\\" The original building consisted of a semicircular auditorium, a soaring 225-foot (68.5 m) tower, and a wing containing class rooms. The soaring straight lines of the tower provide physical, visual, and philosophical linkage to the Gothic Cathedrals of past ages as well as allowing the designers to indulge in the Art Deco celebration of the vertical. Tower detail At the top of the tower, as well as on many of the other high points and used much in the same manner that churches in the Middle Ages utilized crockets and finials, is a stylized sculpture that represents two hands raised upward in prayer. This motif of praying hands is one that is echoed throughout the building and is one of the areas of design that can be traced back to the early drawings by Robinson. While the building is in many ways unique, the idea of the large, semi-circular main auditorium has an earlier precursor in another Methodist church, Louis Sullivan's St. Paul's Methodist Church, designed in 1910 and built, somewhat modified, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1914. Like many other Art Deco buildings, the Boston Avenue Church reveled in the use of various building materials, so metal, glass, terra cotta, Indiana limestone and Minnesota granite can all be found. The exterior is decorated with numerous terra cotta sculptures by the Denver sculptor, Robert Garrison, who had been a student of Adah Robinson's in Oklahoma City. These sculptures include several groups of people at prayer representing Spiritual life, Religious Education and Worship. In these groups again can be found the two hands together motif. Above the south entrance are the equestrian Circuit Riders, statues of the early Methodists engaged in spreading the Good Word. Two of the three riders represent historic individuals, Bishop Francis Asbury, the first American Methodist bishop and Bishop William McKendree, while the third figure, the one in the center, is symbolic of all the other men of God who did His bidding from horseback. The face on this rider was created by Garrison using the church minister's father- in-law, the Rev. T.L. Darnell, of as his model. Rev. Darnell had in fact been a circuit rider for half a century. Over the north entrance of the building there can be found idealized statues of John Wesley his brother Charles Wesley and Susanna Wesley, their mother. Other places on the exterior reveal classic art deco styles organic plant designs, which. like the stained glass windows were based on designs drawn from Oklahoma flora, most notably the tritomas and coreopsis flowers. Detail above entryway The building was not long in making an impression on the architectural world. Influential art critic of the day, Sheldon Chaney, allows it 5 pictures in his book [see References. below] and praises it saying that, \\"its detail is daringly new, its ornamental idioms fresh and vital, its masses fairly well sculpted and perfectly expressive of the plan,\\" and adding, \\"But why for the Methodists?\\" In 1978 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1999. In 1993, murals were installed on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the congregation. They were designed by Chicago artist Angelo Gherardi who continued the Art Deco design to be consistent with the building's interior and exterior design. The construction of a Columbarium inside the building was completed in 2000. Designed by Tulsa architect Roger Coffey, it allowed for the cremains of church members and their immediate family members to be interred there. The columbarium contains a by cut glass window created by Richard Bohm of the Tulsa Stained Glass company. A stone from the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church is one of the stones embedded in the walls of the Chicago Tribune Building, along with over 100 others picked from historic buildings and famous sites from around the world. The Boston Avenue Church contains a 105 rank Möller pipe organ, dedicated in 1962 at 72 playable ranks of pipes and expanded in 1986. The organ was further modified in 1995 by Daniel Angerstein. In 1999 a new Trompette-en-chamade was added. A complete stoplist for the organ can be found on the Organ Page for the Boston Avenue Church.Bostonaveunue.org The church was built by W. S.

In 1969 Marxist revolutionary groups MR8 and ALN abducted the US ambassador to Brazil, Charles Burke Elbrick. The revolutionaries demanded the liberation of fifteen prisoners, including José Dirceu. This incident is the basis of the film Four Days in September. After that he travelled to Cuba. While in exile, Dirceu worked, received military training and studied on the island. According to him, he changed his appearance through plastic surgery. Dirceu returned to Brazil in 1975 under the false name of \\"Carlos Henrique Gouveia de Mello\\". He married his first wife and lived in Paraná in total secrecy, with his true identity unknown even to his wife, until 1979, when he returned to Cuba. His official exile ended in 1980, after amnesty. Separated from his first wife, he married again, to the psychologist Ângela Saragosa, and assumed his real identity. The marriage to Saragosa came to an end in 1990. In 1991 he married his current wife, Maria Rita Garcia Andrade, an old friend from his militant days. He has three children. Dirceu played an active role in the movement to grant amnesty to those tried for and convicted of political activities, as well as in the coordination of the Diretas Já campaign in 1984 in favor of direct presidential elections. ==Political career== With a law degree from the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo, he served as assemblyman from 1987 to 1991 (SP-PT) and congressman from 1991 to 1995 (SP-PT) and, again, from 1999 to 2003 (SP-PT). He was elected president of the PT in 1995 and re- elected in 1997. Dirceu held numerous posts in the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT), of which he is a founder, including the presidency of the National Executive between 1995 and 1997. In 1989 he coordinated first presidential campaign of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He exercised various parliamentary activities in municipal councils, state legislative assemblies, and the legislative chamber of the Federal District. Among them, he was a member of the Finance and Budget Commission and vice-president of the Public Safety Commission. From January 1, 2003 to June 16, 2005, Dirceu was Lula's chief-of- staff. In Brazil, the chief-of-staff has a ministerial status similar to the British Cabinet Office, and Lula's presidential decree putting him in charge of all government appointments gave him more power still. ==Mensalão corruption scandal== Dirceu's departure as Lula's chief-of-staff is attributed to a massive corruption scheme in the legislature, the Mensalão scandal. Upon leaving the government, Dirceu resumed his roles as an elected congressman for the state of São Paulo. He was expelled from the Congress on November 30, 2005, accused of breaching the parliamentary decorum due to his involvement with the Mensalão scandal, and barred from holding any executive or legislative positions until 2015. As of 2006, he was practicing in a law firm in Rio de Janeiro. He was prosecuted and convicted by the Attorney General, charged with being the leader of the mensalão. He charged with of corruption, embezzlement, racketeering and money laundering, among other charges, by the Supreme Federal Tribunal in August 2012, and found guilty in October 2012. He is currently serving a 7-year sentence at the Papuda prison. ==Petrobras corruption scandal== On August 3, 2015 he was again arrested on suspicion of corruption and money laundering as result of the Operation Car Wash investigation. On May 18, 2016, he was found guilty and sentenced to 23 years and three months in prison. He had previously been sentenced to more than ten years' imprisonment in connection with mensalo. On May 3, 2017 an appeal court granted him bail pending appeal, which had previously been denied. The prosecutor in charge of the investigation called the decision \\"incoherent\\" and said that Dirceu's liberty posed \\"real risk to society\\". Prosecutors charged Dirceu the same day with diverting R2.4 million from Petrobras contracts with and UTC. ==References== ==Further reading== * Minister José Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva Pinto - Biographical Data (from Brazilian government) * Dirceu, the radical wizard, Narco News * Brazil's Congress suspended amid angry scenes, Reuters * A profile of José Dirceu, based on an account published by Veja magazine, Brazzil magazine * Alianca Libertadora Nacional (ALN), MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base *Dirceu finally taken out of office Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Workers' Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Presidents of the Workers' Party (Brazil) Category:Brazilian Communist Party politicians Category:Brazilian guerrillas Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from São Paulo Category:People from Minas Gerais Category:Brazilian politicians convicted of corruption Category:Far- left politics in Brazil ","title":"José Dirceu"},{"id":"1438306","text":"Herdy Gerdy is an action-adventure strategy puzzle video game for the PlayStation 2 console, released in 2002. It is developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive. The game involves herding animals, navigating obstacles, and solving puzzles. The player has to collect a variety of herding tools, and there are alternate pathways to reach the end. ==Gameplay== The game is best described as a virtual shepherd sim, with some adventure and platform elements. The player must herd enough creatures into their pens to unlock areas and new levels. However, the various creatures have certain reactions and skills; some swim while some drown, for example. The levels themselves are difficult to negotiate, with pirate ships, winding caverns, and ruins blocking Gerdy's path. The creatures are controlled by a complex but flawed artificial intelligence. They are prone to getting stuck, sometimes irretrievably, on objects in the environment owing to a lack of adequate collision detection. It has a large environment (around 40 different areas) as well as 12 different fictional creatures to herd into their different pens. The game requires strategic thinking as some animals eat the others, some animals cannot jump, some cannot swim and each animal kind requires a separate herding technique. The heads-up display is relatively simple: there are three colored displays at the top of the screen. To the left, the display shows the number of dead animals. The next, in the centre of the screen, represents those alive and free, and the display on the right shows those that have been captured. Herdy Gerdy is plagued by automatic camera problems. Although the game features manual camera control, when the view between Gerdy and the camera is obstructed control reverts to automatic often to the chagrin of the player. At the bottom of the screen is a progress bar with dots: each dot confirms that you have captured 5% of the animals in the level. Finally, the map shows the player's position, animals, pens, rainbow buttons, and the gypsy at the end of the level. ==Plot== The game begins with Gerdy attempting to wake his sleeping father, Master Herder Gedryn, who is going to be late for the annual herding competition. It is soon revealed that Gerdy's dad has been placed under a spell by the evil wizard Sadorf. Gerdy is determined to save his dad and the magical island that they live on from Sadorf's evil rule. First he goes to his village to receive herding training from Yggdrasil, a wise old sage, who gives him the Herding Stick. Then he travels to Midmear where he receives the Magic Flute from Red, a magician in training. Soon after that, Gerdy obtains the Magic Horn after beating Efrin, a teenage boy who lives in the Elven Wood. Gerdy heads into the Gold Mine Gorge where he meets Jake, an old gold miner that has recently invented the ladder. However, the ladder cannot support Gerdy's weight, so the young boy must venture on to Belder's Spring. Belder's Spring is an underground spring haunted by the ghost of a miner. Belder, the ghost, gives Gerdy a Magic Feather which will cause him to weigh virtually nothing, allowing him to climb ladders. Gerdy heads up through the mountains to Moonlit Peaks, a snow-covered cliff. There he finds Poric, an old Leprechaun who guards his gold carefully. Gerdy manages to steal Poric's Magic Hammer, allowing him to activate Rainbow Switches. He heads back to Elven Wood, and gets through using his new item. He continues on into Forest Glade, but stops after reaching Crystal Lake. Due to his inability to swim, Gerdy is unable to get to a Gypsy on the other side of a pool. Gerdy explores until he meets a mole living underground. The mole gives him some Magic Gloves, allowing him to push large blocks. Gerdy travels back to Midmear and enters the Ancient Temple. After beating the tricks and traps there, he comes out into Pirate Cove. There he meets a pirate that takes him to an island inhabited by a giant bird. Gerdy defeats the winged terror knows as Skrag, and wins the Magic Swimsuit. He goes back to Crystal Lake and crosses the pool to get to the Gypsy. Gerdy make his way through the rest of the forest to Foxtown. He hitches a ride with a baker to Tournament Island and defeats Sadorf, thus saving the entire Island and his father. ==Reception== Herdy Gerdy received mixed to positive reviews from critics. It has an aggregate score of 69.93% on GameRankings and 69/100 on Metacritic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 video games Category:3D platform games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Core Design games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Herdy Gerdy"},{"id":"1438314","text":"The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical optimization. GAMS is designed for modeling and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems. The system is tailored for complex, large-scale modeling applications and allows the user to build large maintainable models that can be adapted to new situations. The system is available for use on various computer platforms. Models are portable from one platform to another. GAMS was the first algebraic modeling language (AML) and is formally similar to commonly used fourth-generation programming languages. GAMS contains an integrated development environment (IDE) and is connected to a group of third-party optimization solvers. Among these solvers are BARON, COIN-OR solvers, CONOPT, CPLEX, DICOPT, Gurobi, MOSEK, SNOPT, SULUM, and XPRESS. GAMS allows the users to implement a sort of hybrid algorithm combining different solvers. Models are described in concise, human- readable algebraic statements. GAMS is among the most popular input formats for the NEOS Server. Although initially designed for applications related to economics and management science, it has a community of users from various backgrounds of engineering and science. ==Timeline== * 1976 GAMS idea is presented at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming (ISMP), Budapest * 1978 Phase I: GAMS supports linear programming.

At the same time, these users were frustrated by high costs, skill requirements, and an overall low reliability of applying optimization tools. Most of the system's initiatives and support for new development arose in response to problems in the fields of economics, finance, and chemical engineering, since these disciplines view and understand the world as a mathematical program. GAMS’s impetus for development arose from the frustrating experience of a large economic modeling group at the World Bank. In hindsight, one may call it a historic accident that in the 1970s mathematical economists and statisticians were assembled to address problems of development. They used the best techniques available at that time to solve multi-sector economy-wide models and large simulation and optimization models in agriculture, steel, fertilizer, power, water use, and other sectors. Although the group produced impressive research, initial success was difficult to reproduce outside their well functioning research environment. The existing techniques to construct, manipulate, and solve such models required several manual, time-consuming, and error-prone translations into different, problem- specific representations required by each solution method. During seminar presentations, modelers had to defend the existing versions of their models, sometimes quite irrationally, because of time and money considerations. Their models just could not be moved to other environments, because special programming knowledge was needed, and data formats and solution methods were not portable. The idea of an algebraic approach to represent, manipulate, and solve large-scale mathematical models fused old and new paradigms into a consistent and computationally tractable system. Using generator matrices for linear programs revealed the importance of naming rows and columns in a consistent manner. The connection to the emerging relational data model became evident. Experience using traditional programming languages to manage those name spaces naturally lead one to think in terms of sets and tuples, and this led to the relational data model. Combining multi-dimensional algebraic notation with the relational data model was the obvious answer. Compiler writing techniques were by now widespread, and languages like GAMS could be implemented relatively quickly. However, translating this rigorous mathematical representation into the algorithm-specific format required the computation of partial derivatives on very large systems. In the 1970s, TRW developed a system called PROSE that took the ideas of chemical engineers to compute point derivatives that were exact derivatives at a given point, and to embed them in a consistent, Fortran-style calculus modeling language. The resulting system allowed the user to use automatically generated exact first and second order derivatives. This was a pioneering system and an important demonstration of a concept. However, PROSE had a number of shortcomings: it could not handle large systems, problem representation was tied to an array- type data structure that required address calculations, and the system did not provide access to state-of-the art solution methods. From linear programming, GAMS learned that exploitation of sparsity was key to solving large problems. Thus, the final piece of the puzzle was the use of sparse data structures. ==A sample model== A transportation problem from George Dantzig is used to provide a sample GAMS model. This model is part of the model library which contains many more complete GAMS models. This problem finds a least cost shipping schedule that meets requirements at markets and supplies at factories.

He follows them from the small town of Clarksville, to a mountain resort called Lake Minniwahwah, and finally to Boom City, using information gained from overhearing conversations between humans to track them down. Throughout his adventure, he is continually harassed by Killer, a Dobermann belonging to a dog catcher. Eventually it is revealed that Miss Peaches, head of a cat food company, is arranging for dogs to be caught, and smuggled to a factory, where they will be made into her cat food. Jake ultimately makes it to the dog pound, and after rescuing a number of dogs and bribing Killer with bones, gains entry to the factory. There, he manages to prevent Daisy from being killed by the machinery as she is taken through it on a conveyor belt, only for Miss Peaches to appear with a shotgun. Jake farts, sending her falling onto the conveyor belt, where she is taken through the machinery which turns her into her own cat food. The epilogue reveals that all the stolen dogs were saved, and that Jake and Daisy are together. ==Gameplay== Smellovision mode The game allows the player control or interact with over 15 dog breeds each with distinct traits and abilities. They handle things in a different way, that can also be used in challenges or puzzles.\\"Dog's Life - Case Info\\" The game is divided into three areas: Clarksville, a rural town; Lake Minniwahwah, a ski resort; and Boom City. These are then divided into smaller areas such as districts or farms. In every area are humans willing to give missions in exchange for bones. Bones can also be found buried underground or hiding somewhere. Bones are used to increase your stats, which will make it easier to complete missions. Certain smells picked up through the game's \\"Smellovision\\" will activate challenges against a local dog. In each small section of the game there are four challenges, two of which are to find eight smells of the same colour and compete against a local dog. These missions include races, obedience trials, tug-of-war games and a territorial game where the player must run around urinating in marked areas to obtain territory. There are also salons in some levels where Jake can get his coat cleaned and brushed. He also gains a shiny new collar with a silver 'J' at the front. Once these dogs are beaten, the player is able to take control of that dog and use their special abilities to find other bones. Other challenges include scent-collecting challenges, and a minigame called \\"Doggy Do\\", where the player must copy the moves of the local dog. There are also dangers in certain areas, such as the dog catcher and his Doberman. The player must also keep Jake healthy by feeding him, allowing him to defecate and coax people into giving Jake snacks by growling and barking or performing tricks unlocked by doing the obedience trials. Jake is able to do a range of tricks including begging, sitting, lying down and marking his territory. Jake can interact with many characters including: chasing chickens, stealing sausages, and shaking kittens. ==Reception== Dog's Life received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Eurogamer found the game amusing, but felt that it offered little for experienced gamers, being aimed at a younger audience. They praised the game's \\"warm sense of humour\\" and \\"cute visuals\\" and found the idea of controlling a dog to be \\"actually quite cool\\". GameSpot said, \\"There's not a whole lot to Dog's Life, but what there is entertaining enough, and it certainly lets you do things you can't do in just about any other game.\\" GameSpy called it \\"a nice change of pace\\" but found the game bland and considered it to be aimed more at younger children than teenagers. IGN called the gameplay \\"simple and well-executed\\", but noted that the visuals \\"look like the game was ripped from a PSone title\\" and that the audio seemed \\"all over the place.\\" Charles Herold of The New York Times called the game \\"fun but forgettable. I was expecting something more: the feeling of complete and utter admironishment.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, one six, and two sevens, for a total of 28 out of 40. According to the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2009, Dog's Life holds the world record for the most video game voice-overs recorded by one person in a game. Kerry Shale voiced 32 characters from the game. ==ReferencesSony Computer Entertainment Europe - Dog's Life * Dog's Life - Success Corp Category:2003 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Frontier Developments games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games about animals Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in the United States ","title":"Dog's Life"},{"id":"1438318","text":"thumb Yellow dunes are sand dunes that develop after the first set of embryo dunes appear.

The Happiest Celebration on Earth commemorated fifty years of Disney theme parks, and celebrated Disneyland's milestone throughout Disney parks all over the globe. *Happiest Homecoming on Earth **Disneyland Resort -- Anaheim, California, USA *Happiest Celebration on Earth **Walt Disney World Resort -- Lake Buena Vista, Florida, USA **Tokyo Disney Resort -- Urayasu, Japan **Disneyland Resort Paris -- Marne-la-Vallée, France **Hong Kong Disneyland Resort -- Lantau Island, Hong Kong ==Happiest Homecoming on Earth (Disneyland)== Sleeping Beauty Castle with its 50th Anniversary Overlay Lamp post with 50th Anniversary decor. Flowers outside Main Street, U.S.A. train station during 50th celebration Disneyland's 50th anniversary was July 17, 2005, but the celebration was launched on May 5, 2005 in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. ===May 4, 2005=== Disneyland Park was actually closed to the public on this date, the first planned closure of the park in decades for a special media preview. Disney allowed guests staying at the three Disney owned hotels to become \\"extras\\" for the all the media filming going on, though they only were notified by a letter delivered in the middle of the night, so they had no advance notice. ===May 5, 2005=== The Happiest Homecoming on Earth ceremony officially began with a dedication from then- Disney CEO Michael Eisner. The ceremony included fireworks; speeches from Julie Andrews (official ambassador for the 50th anniversary celebrations), and Art Linkletter (original TV anchor for the opening day broadcast); a performance of \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" by Christina Aguilera; and LeAnn Rimes singing the 50th anniversary theme song \\"Remember When\\", composed by Richard Marx. A video conference featured celebrities at the Magic Kingdom (the only live video conference, with Wayne Brady, actor and former Walt Disney World Resort cast member), Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris and the construction site of Hong Kong Disneyland. Featured over 40 children singers from the Southern California Children's Chorus directed by Lori Loftus. Before the Ceremony, at a media presentation in Disney California Adventure Park, Disneyland Resort president Matt Ouimet announced the new attractions Monsters, Inc.: Mike and Sully to the Rescue and Turtle Talk with Crush. ===July 17, 2005=== The actual day of Disneyland's 50th Dedication Day/Press Preview was an event marked by fans' enthusiasm. The first person to enter the park that day was Madison Steigerwald, a 16-year-old girl from Old Greenwich, CT. She and her grandmother, Mary Madison, began to line up at 3 p.m. the day before. Due to the thousands of fans that continued to line up through the night, Disney California Adventure Park was opened and housed everyone until the next morning. A second line formed outside the security checkpoints as thousands more arrived in the final hours before the park opened. Disneyland Park opened at 7:00 a.m., although it took several hours to admit the crowds that showed up that morning. ===Preparations=== In 2004, Disneyland Resort President Matt Ouimet and hundreds of cast members posed for an aerial photo above Disneyland, with each person holding a nine square foot photograph of a Disneyland cast member. When seen from above the placards formed an image of Mickey Mouse, making it the largest photographic mosaic ever created. This initiated the Happiest Faces on Earth in which over thirty giant mosaics of Disney tableaus were displayed at locations around Disneyland and California Adventure composed of photos submitted by guests from the past fifty years. All the mosaics were created by California artist Roy Feinson. Many classic Disneyland attractions re-opened in 2005 after lengthy refurbishments, such as Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, the Jungle Cruise and Space Mountain. A new fireworks show, Remember... Dreams Come True, replaced the former Believe... There's Magic in the Stars. Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams replaced the Parade of Stars and featured elaborate floats with lighting that allowed daytime or nighttime performances. Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters opened in Tomorrowland (at a ceremony with Tim Allen, the voice of Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear), and a new parade featuring Pixar characters, Block Party Bash was featured at Disney California Adventure Park. Comedian and ex-Disneyland cast member Steve Martin opened the Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years exhibition and film, in which he features with Donald Duck. The original attractions which opened with the park also had one of their ride vehicles painted gold for the celebration. The park also contained 50 Hidden Mickeys, golden Mickey Mouse heads with \\"50\\" displayed in the middle, sometimes disguised as part of the surrounding theme. Other refurbishments took place around Disneyland with many areas being re-painted and refurbished to their former glory. The second phase of the re-paint of Tomorrowland commenced after the base silver and blue scheme was laid. Main Street USA and Sleeping Beauty Castle were repainted, and the castle was specially decorated for the celebration. The celebration brought record numbers of guests to the parks, numbers unmatched since the fall of 1996, when mass crowds flooded the park to catch a glimpse of the Main Street Electrical Parade before it went into permanent retirement. ===Into 2006=== In the second half of the celebration, in 2006, Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! opened at Disney's California Adventure. On July 7, 2006, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest had its world premiere on the Rivers of America, as did the first film in the trilogy in 2003. On the same day of Dead Man's Chest premiere, the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction officially reopened after lengthy refurbishments to include characters from the movie trilogy in the attraction's storyline. The 50th anniversary celebration at Disneyland ended on September 30, 2006, and was succeeded by the Year of a Million Dreams. The idea was somewhat revised for the Disneyland Diamond Celebration promotion that was used for the 60th anniversary 10 years after the kickoff for the homecoming. ==Theme song== To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Disneyland, the official anthem song was written by Richard Marx, and was performed for the first time live by Grammy-winning artist LeAnn Rimes. The song reflects on how one can never be too old to enjoy life and childhood dreams one has had. The song was played immediately after the “Remember... Dreams Come True” fireworks spectacular presented throughout the 18-month anniversary celebration at Disneyland. ==Happiest Celebration on Earth== Beyond simply celebrating the 50th Anniversary at Disneyland alone, festivities were held at all Disney owned Theme Parks and cruise throughout the world. ===Walt Disney World Resort=== The Walt Disney World Resort introduced at least one new attraction or show at each of its four theme parks: *Magic Kingdom received a major refurbishment of \\"it's a small world\\", A major refurbishment of Pirates of the Caribbean, a new golden overlay for Cinderella Castle including a temporary stage show held at the castle called \\"Cinderellabration\\" featuring many Disney princesses and a new playground Pooh's Playful Spot. *Epcot received Soarin' from Disney's California Adventure and A Hong Kong Disneyland Preview Center *Disney-MGM Studios received a major refurbishment of the Streets of America area, and the now Extinct Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show from Walt Disney Studios (Disneyland Resort Paris) *Disney's Animal Kingdom temporarily exhibited Lucky the Dinosaur, the first free-roaming automatic Audio-Animatronic figure; in addition in 2006 the park opened Expedition Everest, a highly themed roller coaster through the Himalayas that features an encounter with the Yeti. ===Tokyo Disney Resort=== *Tokyo Disneyland: The Rock Around the Mouse stage show in front of Cinderella Castle, a tribute to rock 'n' roll and Californian culture from the period that Disneyland opened; and a Golden Fiftieth Mickey at the base of the Partners statue in the hub, acknowledging its sister park's milestone. *Tokyo DisneySea: The Raging Spirits roller coaster opened in June, and the new Tower of Terror opened (it has its own new back-story, and is not themed to The Twilight Zone). ===Disneyland Resort Paris=== *Disneyland Park: Space Mountain received a makeover, and is now known as Space Mountain: Mission 2, with new effects and ride configurations throughout. A version of The Magic Kingdom's Wishes fireworks display premiered. *Walt Disney Studios Park: A new land, Toon Studios, and The Twilight Zone: Tower of Terror opened. ===Hong Kong Disneyland Resort=== *Hong Kong Disneyland Resort - The fifth worldwide resort opened as part of the celebration, in September 2005, with one theme park and two hotels. ===Disney Cruise Line=== The Disney Magic sailed to the West Coast in the summer of 2005, where it offered 12 one-week cruises from Los Angeles to the Mexican Riviera with port calls at Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlán and Cabo San Lucas.

It is the second game of the Jak and Daxter series and is the sequel to Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. It was followed by Jak 3 a year later. The game features new weapons and devices, new playable areas, and a storyline that picks up after the events of The Precursor Legacy. The player takes on the dual role of protagonists Jak and Daxter. Jak II received critical acclaim upon release. Critics applauded the game for being very polished in nearly every department, with many agreeing it was one of the best PlayStation 2 games released at the time. Some criticism, however, was directed at the checkpoint systems, darker tone and high difficulty. == Gameplay == The gameplay of Jak II is significantly different from the previous game. The Eco timed power-up gameplay from the previous game has been removed, and introduction of weapons such as the Morph Gun, a multipurpose firearm, adds a greater emphasis on enemy combat. The player can unlock four different gun mods for the gun as they play through the game; the Scatter Gun, for close range fighting, the Blaster, for long-range fighting, the Vulcan Fury, a high rate-of-fire weapon in the fashion of a minigun, the bullets of which deal less damage per round compared to the Blaster but are able to pierce enemies and breakables so it can hit multiple targets with a single round, and the Peace Maker, which fires charged blasts of energy, and is extremely powerful. Haven City functions as the game hub world, with various other environments accessible from it. Here, Jak can access new missions by visiting various allied characters. These missions serve as a replacement for the previous game's Power Cell collection gameplay. Throughout the game, the player can collect Precursor Orbs dispersed throughout the various worlds, in order to unlock cheats and other content. Jak can traverse the large city using hover vehicles, and a jet-board, which allows him to hover across water and grind on rails. Due to experiments conducted on him for two years, Jak can transform into a darker version of himself, known as Dark Jak, by killing enemies for Dark Eco. In this form, his melee attacks become more powerful, but he loses the ability to use the Morph Gun. By collecting Metal Head skull gems, gained by killing Metal Head creatures, Jak can gain additional abilities for his dark form. == Plot == === Setting === Jak II takes place in the same fictional universe created by Naughty Dog for Jak and Daxter, though five hundred years after the events of the first game. The game largely revolves around Haven City, a dystopia ruled by Baron Praxis and his Krimzon Guard law enforcers. Haven City serves as the game's hub location, although the player is frequently given tasks that must be fulfilled outside of the city. === Characters === Jak (voiced by Mike Erwin) is the game's protagonist, along with his sidekick Daxter (voiced by Max Casella). When they first arrived in Haven City, Jak was captured by Krimzon Guards and became the subject of Baron Praxis' \\"Dark Warrior\\" project. He became subjected to several experiments, ultimately giving him the ability to become \\"Dark Jak\\", a beastly version of himself which is unleashed when Jak has gathered enough Dark Eco. Daxter is an otter-weasel hybrid (known as an ottsel) and is the game's comic relief. After two years of searching for him, Daxter finally sneaks into the prison holding Jak and rescues him. This is also the first time Jak is heard speaking in the series, which is heavily lampshaded by other returning characters throughout the story. Other important characters include Torn, the second-in-command of the resistance movement known as the Underground; Sig, a Metal Head hunter/Wastelander (someone who gathers artifacts from outside the city); Krew, a vastly overweight gang lord; Tess, a barmaid; Errol, the Baron's right-hand man and commander of the Krimzon Guard; and Ashelin, the daughter of Baron Praxis who helps the Underground behind her father's back. Baron Praxis and the Metal Heads' leader Kor are the story's antagonists. === Story === Some time after the events of The Precursor Legacy, Jak, Daxter, and Samos the Green Sage are invited by Keira, Samos' daughter and Jak's romantic interest, to help her test the artifact recovered from the Acheron Citadel at the end of the last game: the Rift Rider, which utilizes the Rift Gate. When activated, the Rider opens a portal that reveals a strange creature, and they get sucked in. The group is separated and Jak and Daxter land in Haven City, a dystopia ruled by the tyrannical Baron Praxis. The Krimzon Guard, a paramilitary force led by Praxis' right-hand man Errol, arrest Jak and chase Daxter away. For the next two years, Jak is subjected to a series of experiments that involve infusing his body with Dark Eco in Praxis's attempt to create a mutant soldier. During a break from the latest round of experimentation, Daxter finds Jak and breaks him out of the facility. Initially unbeknownst to Praxis and Errol, this last experiment is a success, giving Jak the ability to transform into a mutated version of himself with increased strength, reflexes, stamina and aggression. Jak and Daxter join the Underground, a resistance movement that seeks to replace Praxis with the rightful heir of Haven City, known as the Kid. The Underground is led by a mysterious figure known as the Shadow; his lieutenant Torn refuses to let Jak speak to him. Torn explains that Praxis is at war with the Metal Heads, an evil race of biomechanical creatures that date back to Precursor times. Jak and Daxter later reunite with Keira and Samos, and discover that the Shadow is in fact a younger version of Samos. While exploring the city ruins, Jak and Daxter come across the remains of Samos' hut and realize that they have been flung nearly 500 years into the future, with Haven City built over the remains of Sandover Village. Jak and Daxter learn that Praxis engineered the war with the Metal Heads, bribing them with eco to attack the city just enough that he remain in command. However, the arrangement went sour and the Metal Heads began attacking the city more and more. Unable to defeat the Metal Heads, Praxis obtains the Precursor Stone, a large gem that contains the essence of the last living Precursor. He intends to weaponize the Stone and use it to destroy the Metal Head home nest, unaware that doing so will also destroy Haven City. Krew, a crime lord with ties to the Underground, builds a bomb strong enough to release the Stone's energy, but is subsequently killed when Jak detonates the bomb prematurely. Then, after Jak learns an enigmatic mechanic he's been helping is none other than Keira (with Errol wooing her), it's revealed she's been building a new Rift Rider that will bring her, Jak, Daxter and Samos back home. Meanwhile, Vin, an Underground agent tasked with maintaining the city's defenses, is killed, allowing the Metal Heads to launch an invasion. Jak intercepts Praxis and his men confronting Kor, an elderly man who acts as the Kid's guardian. Kor reveals that he is the true leader of the Metal Heads, as well as the creature responsible for bringing Jak and his friends into the future. After a brief battle, he kills the Baron and escapes. With his dying breath, the Baron entrusts the Precursor Stone to Jak so that he can save the city. As the Krimzon Guard and the Underground join forces to resist the invasion, Jak breaches the nest and locates Kor. Kor admits that he arranged for Jak to be mutated so that he could acquire the Stone, which would give him the power to destroy Mar's descendants. The Kid turns out to be Jak himself, sent into the past to protect him from the Metal Heads, so that when the time came, he could challenge Kor's evil. As the younger Jak is pure and untouched by Dark Eco, he is the key to unlocking the Stone's energy. Jak and Daxter manage to behead Kor using a portion of the Rift Gate, neutralizing the remaining Metal Heads. The young Jak releases the Precursor entity, reactivating the ring (while also bringing about the revelation that Keira's new Rift Rider and the one that brings the group into the future during the game's prologue are one and the same) and allowing the Shadow to escort him to the past and ensure that his destiny will be fulfilled. Taking over Krew's bar as their new home, Jak, Daxter, Samos, and Keira prepare to live out the rest of their lives in Haven City. == Development and release == Jak II began development in 2001. Jak II is the only game in the series in which the versions for English-speaking regions feature the Japanese and Korean voice- over track. The voice-over cast features many notable voice actors, including Showtaro Morikubo as Jak. The other games in the series did not follow suit, leaving the voices to be exclusive to the Japanese and Korean regions. == Reception == Jak II received positive reviews. The game currently holds an 88% approval rating on GameRankings based on 79 reviews and a score of 87 on Metacritic based on 47 reviews. IGN gave it a score of 9.5/10, saying: \\"Naughty Dog weighs in with heavy guns, a dark story and mature content...And unlike pretty much every other platformer in the world, the story here is filled with characters who you'll either love or hate. It's the story that gives this game the feeling that it's an adventure, like Indiana Jones or even Max Payne. Jak is far more likeable now that he speaks, and the fact that he's pissed off and owns honking big guns weaves in an unmistakable new level of emotion into the narrative.\\" GameSpot said, \\"Everything in Jak II comes together to produce one of the best-looking, best-playing games on the PS2 so far\\" and continued: \\"Jak II is an enormous and ambitious game that succeeds on every level, the gameplay is rewarding, and the story twists and turns more than you'd expect from a game like this.\\" Game Informer praised \\"having the freedom to tackle challenges in a less linear fashion\\" and likened the new gameplay to the Grand Theft Auto series. Steven Petite and Jon Bitner of Digital Trends consider Jak II to be the best in the series and one of the PlayStation 2's best platformers. Kotaku Luke Plunkett called Jak II one of the best PlayStation 2 games, highlighting the game's scale and characters. Criticisms were given to Jak IIs shortage of mission checkpoints and overall difficulty. As Naughty Dog developer Josh Scherr once admitted: \\"One thing that everybody can agree on though, is that that game is just way too fucking hard.\\" IGN named Jak II the #8 hardest PlayStation 2 game, citing its combat, platforming, city navigation, and instant death scenarios. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine remarked: \\"It isn't proper to expect us to be perfect in order to make up for your game's many imbalances... Life might not be fair, but I certainly expect my games to be.\\" However, some saw the challenge as a positive, such as PlayStation Magazine, who said: \\"I appreciate a good challenge in today’s games, and JAK II offers it.\\" === Accolades === Jak II won Editor's Choice from IGN and GameSpot, and was followed by a nomination for Best PlayStation 2 Game by GameSpot as well. Jak II was added to Sony's Greatest Hits lineup on September 8, 2004, signifying at least 400,000 copies sold in its first 11 months. Jak II received a \\"Platinum Prize\\" in Japan for sales of over one million units. == References == === Notes === === Footnotes === == External links == * * Category:2003 video games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Dystopian video games Category:Jak and Daxter games Category:Naughty Dog games Category:Open world video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games about revenge Category:Video games scored by Josh Mancell ","title":"Jak II"},{"id":"1438340","text":"Barbarella was the designation of the first German hybrid rocket.

It contrasts with syntaxis and hypotaxis. It is also used to describe a technique in poetry in which two images or fragments, usually starkly dissimilar images or fragments, are juxtaposed without a clear connection. Readers are then left to make their own connections implied by the paratactic syntax. Ezra Pound, in his adaptation of Chinese and Japanese poetry, made the stark juxtaposition of images an important part of English-language poetry. ==Origin of the term== Edward Parmelee Morris wrote in 1901 that the term was introduced into linguistics by Friedrich Thiersch in his Greek Grammar (1831). The term has remained unchanged, but the concept of parataxis has expanded.. == Origin of paratactic style == The term \\"parataxis\\" is a modern invention, but the paratactic style itself goes back to the classical age. Parataxis distinguished itself as a rhetoric style during the fourth and fifth century B.C. because of the development of periodic methods used by orators. Ancient peoples believed these rhetorical styles originated in fifth century Sicily, where Corax and Tisias wrote books about new public speaking styles. It is believed these new methods were brought to Athens in 427 B.C. by Gorgias. After Gorgias' visit to Athens, numerous handbooks were written about new styles of rhetoric. These handbooks have not survived the years, but it is known that they classified rhetoric styles in these books, so it is assumed that the distinction between periodic syntax and more traditional techniques were made. In Rhetoric, Aristotle makes the earliest formal distinction between periodic syntax and older methods. He distinguishes between \\"lexis eiromene\\" and \\"lexis katestrammene\\". \\"Eiromene\\" means \\"to fasten together in rows\\" or \\"to string\\". Aristotle relates the term to the connection of clauses in a statements. Statements along these lines are referred to as unlimited, because the people listening to the speaker do not know how the sentence will end based on its beginning. Aristotle's section in his book regarding these styles of statements is seen today as the description of parataxis and is used to distinguish between Greek prose and periodic and paratactic techniques. Aristotle mentions that this style of writing was used by everyone at a time, but hardly ever by anyone during his own time. == Description == Parataxis can most simply be described as and compared to the way children speak. They speak their ideas as they come to them, one after the other, without logically connecting the ideas together. Parataxis may use commas, semi-colons, and periods to force juxtaposition, but it can also replace these punctuation marks with \\"and\\" to seamlessly string the speech or written piece together and present the words as each being equally important. Works utilizing parataxis as a style may emit a staccato rhythm. This can result in phrases with words that don't seem to go together at all. An example of this is Julius Caesar's phrase \\"Veni, vidi, vici\\" or, \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\". Parataxis can also be a pile of fast-moving ideas with a lack of or insistent rhythm. An example of this form of parataxis comes from the Bible. It says, \\"And God said, \\"Let there be light,\\" and there was light.\\" ==Meaning== Parataxis may be considered from three points of view: *the psychological aspect, *the linguistic means to express the paratactic relation, *and the resulting sentence structure. The underlying idea is that in a connected discourse, complete independence among the consecutive sentences is very rare. This observation is captured in the expression \\"train of thought\\". Consider the following: *The sun was shining brightly. We went for a walk. *The sun was shining brightly; we went for a walk. *The sun was shining brightly, and we went for a walk. *The sun was shining brightly, so we went for a walk. In the first example, the two sentences are independent expressions, while in the last example they are dependent. However, the connection of thought in the first examples is just as real as in the last ones, where it is explicitly expressed via the syntax of subordination. In spoken language, this continuance from sentence to sentence is supported by intonation and timing (rhythm, pause). While details may differ among different languages and cultures, generally similar musicality and shortness of pauses indicate the continuation, while the change of tone and longer pause generally indicate the transition to another connected group of ideas. In storytelling, storytellers utilize paratactic or syntactic styles. Parataxis is common among oral storytellers. When telling a story orally, there are many inconsistencies because of the lack of a written-down, word-for-word, multiply-checked draft. However, audiences do not set out to compare the stories word for word and are only interested in the main points of the story. == Parataxis versus hypotaxis == Parataxis roughly translates to \\"arranging side by side\\", while hypotaxis translates to \\"arranging under\\". Parataxis omits subordinating conjunctions while hypotaxis utilizes them such as the terms \\"when\\", \\"although\\", and \\"after\\". Parataxis juxtaposes ideas and thoughts, while hypotaxis subordinates ideas to one another and can show both juxtaposition and transition. Because of this, hypotaxis can show relationships of cause and effect, chronology, and comparison. Recent studies show that the Zamucoan languages are characterized by a rare syntactic configuration which is called para-hypotaxis, where coordination and subordination are used simultaneously to connect clauses (Bertinetto & Ciucci 2012).Bertinetto, Pier Marco (2009). Ayoreo (Zamuco). A grammatical sketch. Quaderni del laboratorio di Linguistica 8 n.s. (Online version: ). ==Examples== ===Literature=== An example is Mr. Jingle's speech in Chapter 2 of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens. > \\"Come along, then,\\" said he of the green coat, lugging Mr. Pickwick after > him by main force, and talking the whole way. \\"Here, No. 924, take your > fare, and take yourself off--respectable gentleman--know him well--none of > your nonsense--this way, sir--where's your friends?--all a mistake, I see-- > never mind--accidents will happen--best regulated families--never say die-- > down upon your luck--Pull him UP--Put that in his pipe--like the flavour-- > damned rascals.\\" And with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences, > delivered with extraordinary volubility, the stranger led the way to the > traveller's waiting-room, whither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick > and his disciples. Samuel Beckett's opening to his monologue \\"Not I\\" is another example. > Mouth: out ... into this world ... this world ... tiny little thing ... > before its time ... in a godfor– ... what? girl? yes ... tiny little girl > ... into this ... out into this ... before her time ... godforsaken hole > called ... called ... no matter ... parents unknown ... unheard of ... he > having vanished ... thin air ... no sooner buttoned up his breeches ... she > similarly ... eight months later ... almost to the tick ... so no love ... > spared that ... no love such as normally vented on the ... speechless infant > ... in the home ... no ... nor indeed for that matter any of any kind ... no > love of any kind ... at any subsequent stage ... Homer's Iliad also exemplifies paratactic use. \\"So he spoke praying, and Phoebus Apollo heard him, and he came down from the peaks of Olympus, angered at heart holding his bow on his shoulders and the covered quiver. And the arrows clashed on the shoulders of the angered god leaping; and he came like the night then sat apart from the ships and shot an arrow; and terrible was the clash from the silver bow.\\" ===Greek=== In What Is Called Thinking?, Martin Heidegger addresses the paratactic nature of Classical Greek texts. Through analyzing a fragment from Parmenides (typically translated \\"One should both say and think that Being is\\") Heidegger argues that modern syntactic translations of paratactic Greek texts often leave the meaning obscured. He suggests multiple translations of the fragment that may more closely resemble the paratactic Greek original. These include \\"needful : the saying also thinking too : being : to be,\\" and \\"Useful is the letting lie before us, the taking-to-heart, too: beings in Being.\\" Heidegger points to a modern linguistic bias that places paratactic language beneath syntactic language; paratactic language is often viewed as \\"child-like\\" or \\"primitive\\". He argues that a paratactic sentence a child might say, such as \\"dog, woof-woof, bad\\" is not inherently less meaningful than its syntactic equivalent, like \\"dogs bark and can be dangerous.\\" ===Cultural theory=== The term parataxis has also been appropriated by some cultural theorists to describe certain works of art or \\"cultural texts\\" in which a series of scenes or elements are presented side by side in no particular order or hierarchy. Examples might range from the collages of the dadaists and Robert Rauschenberg to many contemporary music videos. The traditional polyptych constitutes another example. ==Notes== Category:Grammar ","title":"Parataxis"},{"id":"1438352","text":"OTRAG (, or ), was a German company based in Stuttgart, which in the late 1970s and early 1980s planned to develop an alternative propulsion system for rockets. OTRAG was the first commercial developer and producer of space launch vehicles. The OTRAG Rocket claimed to present an inexpensive alternative to existing launch systems through mass-production of Common Rocket Propulsion Units (CRPU). ==History== OTRAG was founded in 1975 by the German aerospace engineer Lutz Kayser. OTRAG's goal was to develop, produce, and operate a low cost satellite launch vehicle. It was the first private company to attempt to launch a private spacecraft. The OTRAG rocket was intended to be an inexpensive alternative to the European rocket Ariane and the NASA Space Shuttle. Kayser and a private consortium of six hundred European investors financed the development and production of the OTRAG satellite launch vehicle. Dr. Kurt H. Debus served as Chairman of the Board of OTRAG after his retirement as director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, and Dr. Wernher von Braun served as scientific adviser to Kayser. In the face of doubts by Debus and von Braun, Kayser chose in 1975 to set up testing and launch facilities in Shaba, Zaire (now Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Debus and von Braun were concerned about the possibility of Zairian acquisition of missile technology from the facilities. Kayser decided to proceed despite their opposition. Otrag's first test was on May 17, 1977, with the second successful launch on May 20, 1978. The third test failed on June 5, with Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko watching the launch. Political pressure to halt the company's operations mounted quickly. France and the Soviet Union were historically opposed to German long-distance rocket development, and pressured the Zairian government into closing down the development facility in 1979. Immediately afterwards, Presidents Giscard d'Estaing of France and Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union convinced the West German government to cancel the OTRAG project and close down its German operations. In 1980, OTRAG moved its production and testing facilities to a desert site in Libya. A series of successful tests were conducted at this site beginning in 1981. OTRAG shut down in 1987. As the company left Libya, Muammar Gaddafi confiscated all equipment and installations, hoping to later use the technology, and German investors lost their money. ==Rocket design== OTRAG OTRAG CRPU OTRAG was a design quite different from conventional multistage rockets. The OTRAG design used parallel stages assembled from parallel tank tubes with flat bulkheads. The rockets were designed to carry loads up to two tons, the then usual weight of a communications satellite, into a geostationary orbit. It was planned to later increase the capacity to ten tons or more using multiple identical modules. The rocket was to consist of individual pipes, each 27 cm in diameter and six meters long. Four of these pipes would be installed one above the other resulting in a 24 meter long fuel and oxidizer tank with a rocket engine at the lower end making up a CRPU. The fuel was intended to be kerosene with a 50/50 mixture of nitric acid and dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidiser. Ignition was provided by a small quantity of furfuryl alcohol injected before the fuel, which ignites hypergolically (immediately and energetically) upon contact with the nitric acid. To simplify the design, pumps were not used to move the fuel to the engines, instead the fuel tanks were only 66% filled, with compressed air in the remaining space to press propellants into the ablatively cooled combustion chamber. Thrust control is by partially closing the electromechanical propellant valves. Pitch and yaw control can thus be achieved by differential throttling. In principle this is extremely reliable and cheap in mass production. The modular design was intended to result in a large cost reduction due to economies of scale. The CRPU-based satellite launching rocket was estimated to cost approximately one tenth of conventional designs. Automated production processes for all components would reduce labor cost from 80% to 20% and remove the justification for reusability of spent stages. E.g. One large 4 stage configuration OTRAG 10KAstronautix.com OTRAG 2001 inc images to launch Total 10,000 kg. to: 185 km Orbit. Liftoff Thrust: 2,619,990 kgf. Total Mass: 2,278,880 kg. : * stage 1 : 456 CRPU * stage 2 : 114 CRPU * stage 3 : 48 CRPU * stage 4 : 7 CRPU ==Controversies and future outlook== Only a few political controversies are known concerning OTRAG, which involve the concerns of neighbors in Zaire and Libya about the dual use potential of rockets. A full orbital launch vehicle was never assembled. Modules were flight tested in Zaire and Libya. 6,000 static rocket engine tests and 16 single-stage qualification tests were made to prove the concept as feasible . Hans Dietrich Genscher, the then-minister of German foreign affairs, is said to have finally stopped the project under pressure from France and the Soviet Union, and West Germany joined the co-financed \\"European rocket\\" Ariane project, which made the OTRAG project unnecessary and eliminated political entanglements of a still divided Germany in the early 1980s. NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services stipulates a 50% US National ownership in vendor companies like von Braun Debus Kayser Rocket Science LLC, DE (BDKRS). This would have forced Kayser, a German citizen, to sell at least 50% of his shares to Americans. More recently, the company had been advising Interorbital Systems, resulting in a similar modular rocket design for their Neptune series. John Carmack, founder and lead engineer of Armadillo Aerospace has stated in his monthly reports and in forum posts that he expected his path to an orbital vehicle to include modular rockets similar to OTRAG technology. Kayser, being the founding engineer of OTRAG, visited Armadillo in May, 2006 and loaned Carmack some of their original research hardware. > \\"I have been corresponding with Lutz [Kayser] for a few months now, and I > have learned quite a few things.

Until the 9th century it had close associations with the kings of Connacht. Saint Ciarán chose to found the monastery in the ancient territory of Ui Maine at a point where the major East-West land route(Slighe Mhor) meets the River Shannon after crossing the bogs of Central Ireland known as the Esker Riada.Irish Tourism, Clonmacnoise The strategic location of the monastery helped it become a major centre of religion, learning, craftsmanship, and trade by the 9th century and together with Clonard it was the most famous in Ireland, visited by scholars from all over Europe. From the ninth until the eleventh century it was allied with the kings of Meath. Many of the high kings of Tara (ardrí) and Connacht were buried here. The preserved ruin is managed by the Office of Public Works. An Interpretive Centre is open to the public, the graveyard is in use and religious services are held in a modern chapel. ==Geography== Clonmacnoise meaning \\"Meadow of the Sons of Nós\\", is situated in County Offaly, Ireland on the River Shannon south of Athlone. ==History== In 544, shortly after his arrival with seven companions Saint Ciarán a young man from Rathcroghan, County Roscommon met Diarmait Uí Cerbaill who helped him build the first church at the site.(Not to be confused or conflated with St. Ciarán of Saigir, patron of Osraige). This was at the point where the major east–west land route through the bogs of central Ireland along the Eiscir Riada, an esker left by the receding glaciers of the last ice age crossed the River Shannon. It was a small wooden structure and the first of many small churches to be clustered on the site. Diarmuid was to be the first Christian crowned High King of Ireland. In September 549, not yet thirty-three years of age, Ciarán died of a plague, and was reportedly buried under the original wooden church, now the site of the 9th-century stone oratory, Temple Ciarán. Clonmacnoise Castle According to Adomnan of Iona, who referenced the testimony of earlier abbots of Iona who had known Columba, St Columba visited the monastery at Clonmacnoise during the time when he was founding the monastery at Durrow. While he was there he prophesied about the future debates in the churches of Ireland about the dating of Easter and claimed that angels had visited the monastery at Clonmacnoise. While he was there, there was a young monk named Ernéne mac Craséni (who would later be famous in Ireland) who tried to touch Columba's clothes while Columba was not looking, but the saint immediately noticed and grabbed the boy by the neck, and then told him to open his mouth and he blessed him, saying that he would teach the doctrine of salvation. Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. ed. Richard Sharpe. 1995, Penguin Books. Towards the close of the seventh century a plague carried off a large number of its students and professors. Clonmacnoise's period of greatest growth came between the 8th and 12th centuries. It was attacked frequently during these four centuries, mostly the Irish (at least 27 times), the Vikings (at least 7 times) and Normans (at least 6 times). The early wooden buildings began to be replaced by more durable stone structures in the 9th century, and the original population of fewer than ten men grew to perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 by the 11th century. Although the site was based around a core of churches, crosses, graves and ecclesiastical dwellings and workshops, it would have been surrounded by the houses and streets of a larger secular community, the metalworkers, craftsmen and farmers who supported the monastic clergy and their students. Artisans associated with the site created some of the most beautiful and enduring artworks in metal and stone ever seen in Ireland, with the Clonmacnoise Crozier (on display in the National Museum of Ireland) and the Cross of the Scriptures representing the apex of their efforts. The Book of the Dun Cow a vellum manuscript dating to the 12th century, was written here and its main compiler, Máel Muire mac Céilechair meic Cuinn na mBocht reputedly murdered in a Viking raid in 1106.Annals of the Four Masters M1106 By the 12th century Clonmacnoise began to decline. The reasons were varied, the Vikings under Turgesius and the Normans attacked. Without doubt the most debilitating factor was the growth of the town of Athlone to the north of the site from the late-12th century. Athlone became the main trading town for the midlands of Ireland, the most popular route for crossing the Shannon, as well as the best-defended settlement in the region. People migrated north from Clonmacnoise to Athlone, and with the fall in population went much of the support that the site needed to survive, and former allies began to recognise the decline in the site's influence. The influx of continental religious orders such as the Cistercians, Franciscans, Augustinians, Benedictines, Cluniacs, etc. around the same time fed into this decline as numerous competing sites began to crop up. Ireland's move from a monastic framework to a diocesan one in the twelfth century similarly diminished the site's religious standing, as it was designated the seat of a small and impoverished diocese. Clonmacnoise at sunset In 1552 the English garrison at Athlone destroyed and looted Clonmacnoise for the final time, leaving it in ruins. The monastery ruins were one of the stops on the itinerary of Pope John Paul II during his visit to Ireland in 1979. ==Buildings and High Crosses== The site includes the ruins of a cathedral, seven churches, two round towers, three high crosses and a large collection of Early Christian graveslabs. Temple Finghin & McCarthy's Tower Most of the churches have recently undergone comprehensive conservation works, mostly re-pointing, with the Nun's Church (about 1 km off site), currently under wraps while it too undergoes the same process. O'Rourke's Tower: Though named O'Rourkes' Tower, after 10th-century Connacht king Fergal O'Rourke, the Chronicum Scotorum records that it was finished in 1124 by Turlough O'Connor, king of Connacht, and Gilla Christ Ua Maoileoin, abbot of Clonmacnoise. 11 years later it was struck by lightning which knocked off the head of the tower. The upper part of the tower is later work, so there is some speculation that the masonry thus toppled in the storm of 1135 may have been reused in the building of McCarthy's Tower. Temple Finghín & McCarthy's Tower: Romanesque church and round tower – 12th century. An unusual occurrence was the vandalism of this church in 1864 by a person from Birr on a 'pleasure party' to the Seven Churches, as Clonmacnoise was often termed. This led to a landmark case when a prosecution was brought against the vandal by the Crown, due to the efforts of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. Some of the funds which had been raised for the prosecution were later used by the Society to repair the cap of the church's tower. The structure is possibly the earliest example of a church and round tower being part of a single structure in Ireland. Temple Connor: Church used by the Church of Ireland since the 18th century. It underwent significant restoration works in the second decade of the twentieth century, when the pitch of the roof was raised and the internal space was remodelled. The church is maintained under the auspices of the Athlone Union of Parishes, and each Sunday during the summer a service is held at four o'clock in the afternoon. North Cross: Oldest of the three extant crosses. Created c.800. Only the limestone shaft and sandstone base (a former millstone) survive. The decoration is non-Christian, with an image of Cernunnos, the Celtic God of hunting and fertility, displayed on the east face of the shaft. Temple Kelly: All that remains of this church are the low-lying perimeter stones, which still give a good indication of the church's original size. Temple Ciarán: At 2.8 by 3.8 metres, the smallest church in Clonmacnoise. Traditionally presented as the grave site of St. Ciarán, excavations of the church unearthed the Clonmacnoise Crozier, but no saintly remains. Replica of the Cross of the Scriptures Cross of the Scriptures: This 4-metre-high sandstone cross is one of the most skilfully executed of the surviving high crosses in Ireland, and of particular interest for its surviving inscription, which asks a prayer for Flann Sinna, King of Ireland, and Abbot Colmán who commissioned the cross. Both men were also responsible for the building of the Cathedral. The cross was carved from Clare sandstone c.900. The surface of the cross is divided into panels, showing scenes including the Crucifixion, the Last Judgement, and Christ in the Tomb. The original was moved into the visitors' centre in 1991 to preserve it from the elements; a replica stands at the original site. Interior of Temple Rí (King's Church) Cathedral (Temple McDermot): Building started around 909 by King Flann Sinna and Abbot Colmán mac Ailella. The west doorway has been recently (and somewhat controversially), comprehensively restored with the Gothic-style north doorway, often called the Whispering Arch, dating to the mid-15th century. The Cathedral is the largest of the churches at Clonmacnoise. Rory O'Connor, the last High King of Ireland, was buried near the altar in 1198, joining his father Turlough. Most of the graves currently seen in the church are those of the Coghlan family, whose patriarch extensively rebuilt the cathedral in the mid-seventeenth century. Temple Melaghlin: Built c.1200. Also called the King's Church, due to the fact that at least seven generations of Melaghlin Kings are said to be buried underneath the structure. The church is also believed to have housed the scriptorium, the room where the manuscripts were designed and decorated. Detail of Cross of the Scriptures South Cross: A 9th-century piece originally situated at the southern end of the site's central hub. It has one Christian scene on its west face, a rough carving of the Crucifixion of Christ. Many believe that the Cross may have been part inspiration for the later Cross of the Scriptures. Again, the original is in the interpretative centre, with a replica occupying its original site. Temple Dowling: Originally built in the 10th century, this tiny church is named after Edmund Dowling, who renovated it in 1689, placing a stone carving of his family crest above the door. Temple Hurpan: Built in the 17th century at the east end of Temple Dowling, this annexe had no religious function outside of being a burial ground for some members of the local parish. Sometimes referred to as MacClaffey's Church. ==Interpretative Centre and facilities== Clonmacnoise was handed over by the Church of Ireland to the Irish Government in 1955 and has been maintained by various departmental bodies since then. Currently the Office of Public Works manages the site on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The current visitors' centre opened in 1993, replacing a wooden structure, and entry to the site is contingent on the payment of an entry fee seven days a week (from 1973 to 1985 a part-time guiding/interpretative service was maintained, which also required a small admission fee). The centre was designed to cater for a maximum of 80,000 visitors per annum; it attracted roughly 169,000 visitors in 2007 and 135,000 in 2010. Main features of the Interpretative Centre are exhibits depicting the history of Clonmacnoise and the area, archaeological artefacts (including the original stone crosses, brought indoors for preservation and display), information on the people who would have lived and worked there, and a section on the local ecology of the Shannon and the wetland bogs. Other amenities include a theatre for audio/visual presentations, a Fáilte Ireland tourist office, gift shop, tea room, toilets and parking. Guided tours of the site may be booked in advance for groups. ==The Fairy's or Horseman's Stone== Near the Chapel of Clonfinlough at Clonmacnoise there are several limestone boulders, one of which is called the Fairy's or Horseman's Stone. It has many cup-shaped hollows, crosses, daggers, and a pair of human feet (an example of a Petrosomatoglyph) possibly connected with the inauguration of Gaelic rulers. ==The Annals of Clonmacnoise== The Annals of Clonmacnoise chronicle events in Ireland from pre-history to A.D. 1408. The original manuscript or manuscripts are lost, and the names of its compilers are unknown. It is so-called because it was thought to be based on materials gathered at the monastery of Clonmacnoise. ==Annalistic references== W. H. Bartlett, 1884) * 792.

In 2001 the parish had a population of 382, reducing to 376 at the 2011 Census. Princethorpe is located roughly halfway between the towns of Rugby, Warwickshire and Leamington Spa and is at a crossroads between the A423, B4453 and B4455 (Fosse Way) roads. The village contains a pub called the Three Horse Shoes. Situated on Leamington Road in the village is Our Lady's Primary School. It is a primary school with around 100 children between the ages of 4 and 11. Just outside the village is Princethorpe College, a Roman Catholic school. The school incorporates the buildings of the former St. Mary's Priory, which was founded by French Benedictine nuns from Montargis who sought asylum from the French Revolution. The college chapel was designed and built by Peter Paul Pugin. There is also an independent retreat centre close to the college. The area surrounding the college is heavily wooded. There is a small, well-stocked pond among the trees called Little Switzerland In the 1950s, a number of Roman coins were found in Princethorpe. This is related to the fact that the Fosse Way, an old Roman road, runs through the village. There is also what seems to be an ancient burial or signal tower mound on the outskirts of the village (on the road to Marton), but not much else is known about it. Its name came from Anglo-Saxon Prǽnesþorp = Prǽn's outlying farmstead or hamlet. In the time of Edward I it was called Prenesthorpe.In the reign of Henry VI it came into the possession of the Hugford family of Emscote and stayed in that family until the reign of Henry VII when John Hugford sold it to Sir William Compton. Princethorpe was originally in the parish of Wolston but was made, for convenience, a separate parish with Stretton by an Act of Parliament in the reign of William III. The Parish was to be known as the Parish of All Saints with the Vicar, Francis Hunt, residing in Stretton. There is also a small hamlet north west of the college called Burnthurst and there are roughly 12 dwellings. == Notable people == Land drainage reformer Joseph Elkington developed his drainage techniques while farming at Princethorpe. Vancouver Whitecaps academy head coach Ross Holtom coaches the football teams at Princethorpe. Beth Sharpe is the pastoral head and has split opinions based on banning hard footballs for sponges.

Originally used as offices by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it has served as the headquarters of the United Kingdom's internal Security Service (commonly known as MI5) since December 1994. It also served as the London headquarters of the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) until March 2013. ==History== left The building was constructed in 1929–30 by John Mowlem & Co on riverside land cleared after the disastrous 1928 Thames flood severely damaged run-down residential properties. It was built to designs by Sir Frank Baines, of the Government's Office of Works. It is of design uniform with but not identical to Imperial Chemical House which is opposite it on the north side of Horseferry Road; while Imperial Chemical House was exclusively for ICI, Thames House originally had various uses, including the London headquarters of International Nickel Ltd. Baines's design owes much to the 'Imperial Neoclassical' tradition of Sir Edwin Lutyens and deliberately ties in with the Imperial design of Lambeth Bridge when it was redesigned from 1929. High up on the frontage are statues of St George and Britannia sculpted by Charles Sargeant Jagger. It was owned by Thames House Estates until it was sold to the British Government in 1994. Thames House Estates was jointly owned by ICI and Prudential for many years and subsequently was wholly owned by ICI. The building has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since 16 January 1981. ==MI5 and NIO headquarters== The archway, showing the GMW infill extension built for MI5 Thames House was first used by MI5 between 1934 and 1939: the service was located on the top floor of the South Block. The service relocated to Blenheim Palace for much of the Second World War and then moved to Leconfield House after the war before relocating to 140 Gower Street in 1976. The dispersed and dilapidated state of its previous buildings at 140 Gower Street (headquarters) and Curzon Street House (registry, administration and technical services) led MI5 to seek a new home in the late 1980s. The Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) were engaged in a simultaneous hunt for new headquarters and consideration was given to co-location of the two. However this proposal was abandoned, due to the lack of buildings of adequate size (existing or proposed) and the security considerations of becoming a single target for attacks. At the same time, Thames House, which was largely used as government offices by then, became vacant when the Department of Energy left the southern half in 1989 and it was decided to convert and refit much of it for MI5's use. The GMW Partnership undertook the design and Mowlem carried out the necessary reconstruction work from 1990, which included part-infilling of the building's distinctive archway. An automated miniature monorail within the building brings files up from the basement of Thames House to staff working within. The refurbished Thames House was officially opened on 30 November 1994 by Prime Minister John Major. The building was shared with the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) until that organisation moved to 1 Horse Guards Road alongside HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office in 2013. On 1 June 2007, the building (other than the steps that give access to it) were designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the building. ==Popular culture== Up until its seventh series, the BBC television series Spooks used the exterior and lobby of the Freemasons' Hall in Great Queen Street as a location for the show's portrayal of Thames House. Since then Thames House has been used, although Freemasons' Hall is still used to show the entrance to the building. The third series of the BBC television series Torchwood used Thames House as the setting for the arrival of an alien species on Earth.

She is the leader of New York City's subterranean mutant settlement the Morlocks, until losing that post in a duel against Storm. Storm subsequently leaves the group in Callisto's care as her representative, and the two eventually form an uneasy alliance. Callisto appeared in the 2006 film, X-Men: The Last Stand, where she was played by actress Dania Ramirez. ==Publication history== Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Paul Smith, she first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #169 (May 1983). ==Fictional character biography== Callisto's origins are unknown, although she claims that the scars she bears are proof of \\"how dumb a mistake\\" it was for her to try to live among normal humans; in one of her earlier appearances, her greatest psychological fear is the image of the beautiful woman that she once was. ===Morlocks=== Callisto takes up residence in an abandoned Cold War-era bomb shelter hidden within the sewers. Under untold circumstances, she meets Caliban, a mutant whose power is to sense the presence of other mutants. She decides to make the bomb shelter a sanctuary for mutants like herself, using Caliban's power to track down such mutants.Uncanny X-Men #170 She calls this newly formed society the Morlocks, after the group of futuristic subterraneans known as Morlocks in The Time Machine by H.G. Wells.Uncanny X-Men #169 Callisto kidnaps Angel, intending to make him her mate. Kitty Pryde is struck with a deadly illness in an attempt to rescue him, and Callisto refuses to allow her companions to take her to the surface for medical treatment. To rescue Kitty, Storm challenges and beats Callisto in a duel for the leadership of the Morlocks.Uncanny X-Men #169-170 As the new leader of the Morlocks, Storm decrees that they would no longer kidnap and terrorize surface-dwellers, and in return they would have peace. The confrontation between Callisto and Storm leaves both parties consumed with hatred for each other.Uncanny X-Men #171 thumb Callisto attempts to take revenge on Storm by manipulating Kitty Pryde into marrying Caliban, but is foiled when Caliban releases Kitty from their betrothal.Uncanny X-Men #179 When the wizard Kulan Gath enslaves and ensorcells the city of New York and transforms it into a Hyborian Age city, Callisto becomes his warrior servant. She battles Storm again, but Storm saves her life. Callisto helps defeat Kulan Gath, and as a result Callisto and her allies find themselves on a new timeline where Kulan Gath never transformed New York.Uncanny X-Men #190-191 Thereafter, Callisto becomes more of an ally to the X-Men. She rescues Professor X after he was nearly killed by an anti-mutant mob.Uncanny X-Men #193 She saves Power Pack from the Morlocks Annalee and Masque.Uncanny X-Men #195 Callisto is wounded during the Marauders' massacre of the Morlocks, and takes refuge with the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #211 She convinces Storm not to give up leadership of the X-Men.Uncanny X-Men #212 After a while, Callisto moves to Muir Island to become the bodyguard for Moira MacTaggert. With Moira, she is transported to an alternate Earth where Britain is dominated by Nazis.Excalibur #4 Meanwhile, the Nazi counterparts of Callisto and Moira appear on the mainstream Earth.Excalibur #6 These counterparts capture Brigadier Alistaire Stuart at the Tower of London,Excalibur #9 but fail in their attempt to escape the Tower of London.Excalibur #10 Both Callisto and Moira and their counterparts then return to their native Earths.Excalibur #11 ===Being beautiful=== Callisto later encounters an amnesiac Colossus, who has assumed the identity of artist Peter Nicholas. Peter remembers nothing of his former life after his journey through the Siege Perilous. The two become attracted to each other after Masque, who had taken control of the Morlocks in Callisto's absence, restores Callisto's beauty to greater than it was, only to take it away later as a means of tormenting her.Uncanny X-Men #259-260 The process is repeated several times before Callisto and Colossus are rescued by Forge, Banshee, and Jean Grey.Uncanny X-Men #262 Callisto began a career as a fashion model and moved above ground, embarking on a new life with Peter Nicholas as her lover. They were attacked by Genoshan magistrates but defeated them.Uncanny X-Men #264 The Morlocks later attacked Callisto, still under the influence of Masque. Masque had grossly transformed the Morlocks, leaving them with grotesque physical mutations. They nearly beat Callisto to death. The Morlocks' Healer treated her wounds, but accidentally restored Callisto's scars and her original physical deformities. The Healer's powers were overloaded by the severity of her injuries, killing him in the process. Callisto vowed revenge on her former followers for stealing away her looks, and then allied herself with Mikhail Rasputin, Colossus' older brother. Mikhail and Callisto appeared to have perished when he used his powers over matter to flood the Morlock tunnels. Rasputin had actually transported the Morlocks into an alternate reality, where time moved more quickly than on Earth. There she watched as the Morlock youths grew up with great bitterness towards their elders for all that had happened to them. When the young Morlocks, now calling themselves Gene Nation, returned to Earth with revenge planned, she went looking for help and located her former love Colossus, who had recently returned to Earth after the fall of Avalon. The two returned to the X-Mansion to warn the X-Men that Gene Nation was planning to kill innocents for every Morlock killed during the Mutant Massacre. Drawing Storm and Wolverine into the tunnels, she witnessed as Storm fought Marrow in a duel that saw the X-Man once more resort to lethal measures to win. Callisto remained in the tunnels looking over Marrow until she became injured during the events of Operation: Zero Tolerance. Recovering from her wounds, she told Marrow to find a place amongst the X-Men, figuring it to be the best place for her. Callisto also has a maternal relationship with Marrow, acting as a mother-figure towards the young mutant, though the two are not biologically related, making her the only person Marrow would follow nearly blindly. After the six-month gap and Marrow's departure from the X-Men, Callisto disappeared. Later, Callisto was once again transformed by Masque, having her arms reformed into tentacles. Callisto was also under Masque's control in \\"The Arena,\\" an elite fight club in Japan. Callisto and Storm battled each other in the Arena, but later both escaped with help from Storm's friend, Yukio.X-Treme X-Men (Feb, 2004) #36-39 ===Genoshan Excalibur=== She was one of the main characters in the 2004 Excalibur title, where she was helping Professor Xavier and Magneto rebuild Genosha. This alliance briefly reunited her with Archangel.Excalibur #12–13 ===Son of M=== In the aftermath of House of M, Callisto is among the many mutants to have lost her powers.Son of M #4 (May 2006) Quicksilver offered to her the Terrigen Mists, stolen from the Inhumans, as a way to restore her powers. Callisto willingly accepted the offer and the Mist effectively restored all her previous abilities (minus her disfigurements and arm-tentacles), but without any control over them. Her new senses are so acute that even a drop of rain causes her tremendous pain; unable to handle it, she fell into a coma. The depowered Magneto found her body and showed it to Quicksilver saying that he poisoned her with the Terrigen Mist. He later took her body to a hospital, where the effects of the Mists wore off.Son of M #5 (Jun, 2006) ===X-Cell=== Callisto was later reunited with Marrow as members of X-Cell, a group of mutants who hold the government responsible for their power loss. When Quicksilver offered to repower its members, she warned Marrow about what happens to non-Inhumans who gain power from the Terrigen Mist. She and Marrow later fled into the sewers to escape the government. ===Return to the sewers=== At some point, Callisto returned to the sewers, this time alone. However, she is later discovered by various teen and young adult runaways, who she begins to care for, though with a firm but caring hand. Storm later stumbles upon this group while investigating one of the young girl's disappearance. Storm and Callisto let old feelings surface and the two fight. However, when Storm sees the girl helping Callisto, she realizes that the girl is there by choice and the hostilities cease. Storm helps them clean up. Before leaving, Storm offers Callisto to send regular help should they need it.Storm #2 At the time when the Terrigen Cloud was loose on Earth infecting mutants with M-Pox since the Infinity storyline, the number of mutants that are living underground had increased as Callisto also showed sympathy towards the humans who sought out refuge from the global landscape. As a way to live out the dream of Professor X, this unified society of humans and mutants lived together as the New Morlocks.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #7 But her little community soon came under assault when morlocks infected by a type of psi-vampirism attacked them while Monet and a morally inverted Creed stayed down in their territory to suss out the source of a new mutant sickness.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #8 As it happens the perpetrator of the underlife abductions was none other than M's brother Emplate, whom was suffering as much from the M-Pox epidemic as everyone else since it was killing off his only food supply. Callisto and Sabretooth attempted to fight him off and free the captured morlocks but were quickly incapacitated by the mutant leech.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 4 #9 ===X-Men: Gold=== Callisto would soon find herself incarcerated at a new superpowered prison for homo superior, despite not being a mutant anymore due to Decimation. She would become an inmate at the 'Robert Kelly Correctional Facility'; also known as The Box, whilst playing gopher to the other inmates.X-Men: Gold Vol. 2 #23 At first attempting to become top dog while jailed at the mutant's only penitentiary, she was soon reminded of her place when a burlier convict had lain her out for thirty days. Now she sends a warning towards new inmates Kitty, Storm and Rachel Grey-Summers that said jailbird who runs the block is zeroing in on the X-Men in order to solidify her status as #1. As it turns out, it was all staged by the depowered outlaw; the win-win situation being that she could establish herself as the new alpha if a trio of hated enemies succeeded and would still garner personal satisfaction at their defeat in the case that they failed.X-Men: Gold Vol. 2 #24 Sometime after their release and news of Kathrine Pryde's marriage to Piotr Rasputin is outed to the public, Callisto escapes prison to confront Kitty while she's out on a bachelorette party to celebrate. The two fight for a bit with Kitty mistaking her intentions as another attempted kidnapping but Callisto's intentions were in fact plain.

A couple days before the nation leaders death & resurrection,X-Force Vol. 6 #2 Callisto was called to the personal island quarters of Ms. Frost to discuss a mutual partnership with the queen of the underground. The White Queen petitioning her to be Emma's white knight in the Hellfire Trading Company both to foster trust amongst the mutant and human communities due to her own overly persuasive nature, and the fact that high seas transport can be incredibly dangerous and her branch of the industry needs enforcers to manage the national interests of Krakoa.Marauders #7 Although a bit irked at Emma Frost for ignoring her for most of her life, Callisto decides on a temp occupation of the position until deciding on whether or not she feels comfortable with the gig. While still somewhat untrusting of the White Queen, Callisto admits to her treacherous lieutenant Masque that she's interested in what she's selling nonetheless. After half a year working as Emma's paladin, she would meet up with members of the Red Queen's; Cathrine Pryde's, crew on the Marauders at Island M to take and catalog their contraband while exchanging some swift and deadly albeit friendly parley with her old rival Ororo Munroe after they dock. While questioning why it was Lucas Bishop took so long to return to port, the latter wonders about the whereabouts of his leader and friend. To which the White Knight responds that she never returned from her voyage after what happened in Madripoor.Marauders #7 ==Powers and abilities== As a mutant, Callisto possesses enhanced senses of sight (including night vision), hearing, smell, taste, and touch coupled with possibly moderate degrees of enhanced conditioning; such as superhuman strength, speed, agility, etc. It has also been suggested that her mutant power grants her tactical brilliance that allows her to see the best way to engage in any given conflict.X-Treme X-Men #38 Callisto was subjected to biophysical alteration by Masque on numerous occasions, once having multi tendril appendages in place of her arms for a short time.X-Treme X-Men #38 But lost these modifications along with her mutant powers after House of M.New Avengers Vol 1 #18 (Jun, 2006) Her abilities were temporarily restored through use of the Terrigen Mists, although her senses were enhanced to a point where normal sensations became painful.Sone of M #4 (May 2006) Callisto also has excellent hand-to-hand combat skills, is an exceptional hunter and tracker and excels at stealth infantry when necessary.X-Men: The Wedding Special #1 She is usually armed with knives and is adept in their use, having unerring accuracy while in hand as throwing weapons.Marauders #7 She is also an adroit leader whom can come up with incredibly tactile plans & schemes even without her superhuman tactical perception.X-Men: Gold Vol. 2 #23-24 ==Other versions== ===Age of Apocalypse=== In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Callisto is neither a follower of Apocalypse nor an enemy of his regime.

It is also apparent that she has no control over herself when the tentacles come out as Caliban had to knock her out to keep her from killing Jean Grey during a fight with the X-Men.Ultimate X-Men # 83 ===X-Men Evolution=== In the comic based on the show Callisto appears as the leader of the Morlocks. ==In other media== ===Television=== * Callisto appeared in X-Men: The Animated Series. She and the other Morlocks captured Cyclops and Jean Grey rather than Angel. In the Spanish-dubbed version of the show, Callisto is portrayed as a male character in the two-part episode \\"Out of the Past\\". In the other episodes involving the Morlocks, Callisto is correctly voiced by a female Spanish actress. * Callisto also appears in X-Men: Evolution voiced by Saffron Henderson. She is depicted as a less-violent, more even-tempered leader of the Morlocks. She first appeared to sabotage a beverage company when its beverage Pow-R-8 (AKA Power Eight) leaks into the sewers and is revealed to be poisonous to the mutants. She later returned in \\"Uprising\\" when anti-mutant thugs were using laser technology to attack the X-Men, Spyke, and Leech. In contrast to her original personality, this Callisto is a voice of reason with Spyke being the more violent-minded vigilante. ===Film=== * Dania Ramirez portrays Callisto in X-Men: The Last Stand. In the film version, Callisto is a mutant speedster who has the secondary ability to sense the powers and locations of other mutants, a power that, in the comics, belongs to her teammate Caliban. An expert hand-to-hand combatant, she was the leader of The Omegas and then joins forces with Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. In place of an eyepatch and scars, this version of Callisto is heavily tattooed and has many piercings, and she seems to harbor a dislike towards Storm. She was electrocuted against the fence by Storm after their climactic battle on Alcatraz. ===Novelization=== * According to the book adaptation of X-Men: The Last Stand, she was the leader of the Marauders, an all-mutant gang before joining Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. According to a novelty card game, Callisto is said to have been born in the Dominican Republic and emigrated to Washington Heights, in New York City as an infant where she honed her skills as a fighter and tracker. In the book she does not possess superhuman speed. In the novel, Storm shows mercy and spares her life. ==References== ==External links== * MDP: Callisto - Marvel Database Project * Callisto's origin on the Marvel Directory * Callisto at the Marvel Universe Character Bio Wiki * UncannyXmen.net Spotlight on Callisto Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional bodyguards Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses Category:Fictional models Category:Fictional murderers Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes Category:Marvel Comics female supervillains Category:Marvel Comics film characters Category:Marvel Comics martial artists Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:X-Men supporting characters ","title":"Callisto (comics)"},{"id":"1438460","text":"Extreme Associates, formerly known as Extreme and Extreme 2.0, is a pornographic film producer, featuring a catalog of DVD titles and Internet content. It is owned by Rob Zicari (\\"Rob Black\\") and his wife Janet Romano (\\"Lizzy Borden\\").Cossman 2007: 55 The studio's material is controversial, with its films often featuring erotic humiliation and rough sex.Cossman 2007: 22 Extreme has faced legal charges of obscenity in the U.S. It is associated with another adult film company, Evolution Erotica. ==History== Rob Zicari and Janet Romano Extreme Associates evolved from Rob Zicari's former company, Extreme Video. It became known as Extreme Associates in 1997 when Zicari, Tom Byron and Van Damage broke away from Patrick Collins' Elegant Angel and formed their own company. Tom Byron and Van Damage have since left the company. Janet Romano started to work for Zicari in 1998, first as an actress and then as a director. In 2003, it was indicted by the U.S. federal government on obscenity charges. The company is known for being controversial, as it has engaged in public relations wars with Vivid Video, Patrick Collins and his company Elegant Angel, Paul Fishbein and his publication Adult Video News, and Larry Flynt. Extreme Associates has been featured on America's Most Wanted, Nightline with Ted Koppel and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and also in publications such as TIME Magazine and Details Magazine. The company is the subject of the documentaries: PBS Frontline: American Porn (2002) and The Porn King vs. The President, and co-owner Lizzy Borden recently stated that there are more documentaries about the company in the process of being filmed. Extreme Associates operated a professional wrestling promotion called Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) from 1999 to 2003. In March 2006 Extreme became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Shots Video Netherlands. The Dutch company is responsible for series like Men’s Lounge, Bi Sex, Clinic Sex and Deep Throat Anal. Shots had been the exclusive European distributor for Extreme Associates since 2004. In April 2006 Extreme films were added to AdultRental.com's video on demand service. Starting in May 2006 the studio's content could be downloaded to the iPod and PSP. In February 2007 Extreme signed a deal to be the exclusive distributor of all-black studio Baller Nation's films. In September 2007 the company announced it would be halting DVD sales, and would be distributing content exclusively through its video on demand service, ExtremeVOD.com, which was launched in February 2006. The decision was taken due to the general downturn in porn DVD sales, and the refusal of some retailers to stock the studio's films. Extreme posts approximately one hour's worth of free content on numerous \\"porn tube\\" websites every month, in the form of clips lasting just a few minutes. Black thinks the various 'Porn 2.0' user-generated content sites are useful for spreading brand awareness, even if it is difficult to measure how much this increases sales. ==Obscenity prosecution== The filming of Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which included several simulated rapes, was covered in the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn which aired on February 7, 2002; the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set.Cossman 2007: 56 Zicari was interviewed in the documentary; he defended the company's content and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft to take action against him. Zicari stated in an interview for the program, \\"We've got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for. I'm not out there saying I want to be the test case. But I will be the test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity. I would welcome everything, to make a point in, I guess, our society\\". These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities. On April 8, 2003, the premises of Extreme Associates were raided by federal agents, and five videos were seized. The United States Postal Inspection Service and the Pornography Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department's Organized Crime and Vice Division had conducted the investigation leading to the indictment. On September 5, 2002 a U.S. postal inspector had joined the Extreme website. Postal inspectors then viewed clips on the site, and ordered three videotapes which were sent to a postal agent in Pittsburgh. On August 6, 2003 Black, Borden and the company were indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh on ten counts of the production and distribution by mail and the Internet of obscene pornographic materials. Zicari and Romano faced a maximum total sentence of fifty years in prison, a fine of $2,500,000, or both. Extreme Associates, Inc. faced a maximum total sentence of a term of probation of fifty years and a fine of $5,000,000. The prosecution also sought forfeiture of the films charged in the indictment, all gross profits from the distribution of the films, and all property used to facilitate the alleged crimes, including the domain name extremeassociates.com. At the time it was the first major federal obscenity prosecution in ten years. On March 11, 2009 Extreme Associates and its owners pleaded guilty to the reinstated obscenity charges to avoid trial, effectively shutting down the company. Extreme Associates also apparently took its website down concurrent with the plea. ==Films== ===Nature of content=== Extreme Associates bills itself as having the hardest hardcore pornography on the Internet. The studio's content has been described as \\"extremely violent\\", \\"shocking\\", \\"slasher porn\\" and \\"patently offensive\\".Cossman 2007: 57 In an interview with Salon.com Borden said of Extreme's content, \\"It's disgusting but I like to watch it because it's shocking\\". Borden and Zicari compare their films to slasher films and some reality television, which people watch in order to be shocked. Talking to ABC News about his films, Zicari said, \\"You might not like what you had just seen. It might have disturbed you, it might have repulsed you, it might have given you all sorts of emotions. But are you going to limit and be that person that has the right to say 200 million other citizens cannot watch that because you don't like it?\\" ===Slap Happy=== Slap Happy is a rough sex series, created and directed by Brandon Iron and distributed by EA. The scenes are filmed in a gonzo style and feature male dominance. Iron is the sole male performer in all scenes. Each scene features Iron with one female performer who performs fellatio. Iron holds the female performer's head stationary with his hands, while continually slapping her in the face and verbally abusing her as she continues fellating him. In many scenes, the woman vomits as a result of being gagged by Iron's penis. Iron initially offered the series to 34 companies before Black agreed to distribute it. ==Actresses== Paris Gables Actresses who have worked for Extreme Associates include Alana Evans, Alexandra Nice, Amber Lynn, Anastasia Blue, Ashlyn Gere, Bridget the Midget, Heather Gables, Iroc, Jasmin St. Claire, Jessica Darlin, Jewel De'Nyle, Juanita Chong, Kendra Jade, Kristi Myst, Lizzy Borden (who is also a producer and director), Monique DeMoan, Nikita Denise, Stryc-9, Tiffany Mynx, and Veronica Caine (formerly Barrett Moore).

For many years he was the second leading Russian player after Mikhail Chigorin. Schiffers parents emigrated from Germany. He was born in Saint Petersburg and also died there. Schiffers held the title of Russian champion for 10 years before finally being defeated by his student, Mikhail Chigorin, in 1880. At their first meeting in 1873, Schiffers was able to offer Chigorin (who also from St. Petersburg) knight odds. In 1878 they played on even terms, Schiffers losing the first of two matches 7-3, but winning the second 7.5-6.5, thus establishing himself as the second strongest player in Russia after Chigorin himself. They later played two more matches with Chigorin winning both. At Rostov on Don in 1896 he played a match against former World Chess Champion Wilhelm Steinitz, losing 6.5–4.5. Schiffers played eight major foreign tournaments from Frankfurt 1887 to Cologne 1898. His best tournament result was at Hastings 1895 where he finished sixth with 12/21 (Harry Pillsbury won).

In more recent times market practitioners have expanded this definition to include additional events such as natural disasters and actions initiated by shareholder activists. However, merger arbitrage remains the most well-known investment strategy within this group. Event-driven investing strategies are typically used only by sophisticated investors, such as hedge funds and private equity firms. That’s because traditional equity investors, including managers of equity mutual funds, do not have the expertise or access to information necessary to properly analyze the risks associated with many of these corporate events. This strategy was successfully utilized by Cornwall Capital and profiled in \\"The Big Short\\" by Michael Lewis. ==History== Event- driven investing \\"lost on average 1.4 percent in 2015\\" making them the poorest performers in 2015 despite a record year of mergers and acquisitions partially because funds over purchased only the largest corporate deals. ===Healthcare sector=== According to James Elliot at Alan Davis Wealth Management, about 60% of event-driven hedge funds' year-to-date gains...making it the strongest contributor by a large margin.\\" According to Dealogic, by August health care mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) were up 42%, with \\"an all-time high of $422.8 billion;\\" in 2014 the high was $429.3 billion for the entire year and also set a record.

Flecknoe is a village in the Rugby district of Warwickshire, England, one mile west of the border with Northamptonshire. The village is the largest settlement within the civil parish of Wolfhampcote, and has a population of around 200. The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book as Flachenho, probably meaning \\"Flecca's hill\\". The village is shown as Fleckno on the Christopher Saxton map of 1637. Flecknoe is quite an isolated village, it is located on a hill, one mile from the nearest main road (the A425 Southam - Daventry road) and is connected only by narrow lanes. Flecknoe has a small church, dedicated to St. Mark, which was built in 1891. An older chapel in the village dating from 1837 is now a private house. The village formerly had a school, which is now the village hall. On the outskirts of the village is a derelict brick building which is the remains of a Second World War camp. The village also has a pub called the Old Olive Bush. The Grand Union Canal runs in the plain to the north of the village, which also contains the remain of the former Weedon to Leamington railway line. Flecknoe once had a railway station on this line. The station was over a mile north of the village and effectively in the middle of nowhere, consequently it was an early victim of British Railways' closure programme, the last passenger train running on 3 November 1952. However, the line survived carrying freight until 2 December 1963. To the east of the village are the remains of the former Great Central Main Line. Around half a mile to the north of Flecknoe is the tiny hamlet of Nethercote. ==References== ==External links== *Wolfhampcoteparish Website * St. Mark's Church, Flecknoe * Flecknoe railway station Category:Villages in Warwickshire ","title":"Flecknoe"},{"id":"1438478","text":"Joaquim Amat-Piniella (November 22, 1913 in Manresa – August 3, 1974 in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat) was a Catalan writer and politician.

As the name suggests, the museum focuses on high-rise buildings as \\"products of technology, objects of design, sites of construction, investments in real estate, and places of work and residence.\\" The Skyscraper Museum also celebrates the architectural heritage of New York and the forces and people who created New York's skyline. Before moving to the current and permanent location in Battery Park City in 2004, the museum was a nomadic institution, holding pop-up exhibitions in four temporary donated spaces around Lower Manhattan since 1996. The Skyscraper Museum was founded and is directed by Carol Willis, a professor of architectural history and urban studies at Columbia University. It includes two exhibition spaces for both permanent and temporary exhibitions, a bookstore, and a mezzanine with its office, situated above the bookstore. The museum can be reached by a ramp starting in the basement. ==Move after September 11, 2001== The original site of the museum was located very close to the World Trade Center. After the September 11 attacks, the museum was forced to close temporarily as its space was commandeered as an emergency information center. In March 2004, the museum reopened in its new permanent home at 39 Battery Park Place in the neighborhood of Battery Park City at the southern tip of Manhattan. It was the first museum to open in Lower Manhattan after the September 11 attacks. The museum occupies an area of on the ground-floor of a mixed-use building, that was donated by the developer. The new site was designed by Roger Duffy of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, working pro bono. The architect tried to amplify the indoor height of the museum, which is . This was arranged by using polished covers of stainless steel on the floors and ceilings, giving the illusion of an infinite vertical space. ==Selected exhibitions== On September 6, 2006, the museum opened an exhibit on the construction of the World Trade Center and the complex's subsequent history. The exhibit includes the original architectural/engineering model of the World Trade Center. On June 24, 2009, the museum opened China Prophecy: Shanghai, a multi-media exhibition that examines Shanghai's evolving identity as a skyscraper metropolis. Featuring models of the major iconic structures, including Jin Mao, Tomorrow Square, Shanghai World Financial Center, and the new super-tall Shanghai Tower, as well as computer animations, film, drawings, and historic and contemporary photography of the city, the exhibition combines an in-depth look at the new generation of towers with an overview of the sweeping transformation of the city’s traditional low-rise landscape into a city of towers. In 2011, the Skyscraper Museum opened a new exhibit called \\"Supertall!\\" dedicated to the tallest buildings in the world, those that stand at least , the height of the Empire State Building. The exhibit features qualifying buildings built since 2001 to those that will be built by 2016 as a commemoration of and to demonstrate the irony of the recent popularity of the skyscraper in many countries, despite sentiment that after the September 11 attacks there would be no more desire to live or work in or to build skyscrapers. Besides in-house exhibitions, the museum also sponsors external shows and programs at various locations in the city. Additionally, the museum offers a unique virtual gallery through its website, which is an advanced 3-D archive of Manhattan skyscrapers. ==See also== *List of museums and cultural institutions in New York City *Museum of Jewish Heritage ==Further reading== *Filler, Martin (April 2015).

Girolamo Da Carpi (1501 – 1 August 1556Erroneously spelled Giralomo in 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.) was an Italian painter and decorator who worked at the Court of the House of Este in Ferrara. He began painting in Ferrara, by report apprenticing to Benvenuto Tisi (il Garofalo); but by age 20, he had moved to Bologna, and is considered a figure of Early Renaissance painting of the local Bolognese School. ==Career== He trained in the studio of a local painter who showed the influence of Lorenzo Costa and Raphael. In the 1520s Girolamo visited Rome and Bologna and was inspired by the Mannerist style of Giulio Romano. Geographically and stylistically he straddles the various influences. He returned to Ferrara and collaborated with Dosso Dossi and Garofalo among others on commissions for the d’Este family. Girolamo became the architect to Pope Julius III in 1550 and supervised the remodeling of the Vatican's belvedere. Returning to Ferrara, he was charged of the enlargements of the Castello Estense.

The word brasserie is also French for \\"brewery\\" and, by extension, \\"the brewing business\\". A brasserie can be expected to have professional service, printed menus, and, traditionally, white linen—unlike a bistro which may have none of these. Typically, a brasserie is open every day of the week and serves the same menu all day. A good example of a brasserie dish is steak frites. ==Etymology== The term brasserie is French for \\"brewery\\", from Middle French brasser \\"to brew\\", from Old French bracier, from Vulgar Latin braciare, of Celtic origin. Its first usage in English was in 1864. The origin of the word probably stems from the fact that beer was brewed on the premises rather than brought in: thus an inn would brew its own beer as well as supply food and invariably accommodation too. In 1901 Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language defined \\"brasserie\\" as \\"in France, any beer-garden or saloon\\".Davidson, Thomas, comp.

Some listed were never gunfighters. The term gunslinger is a modern, 20th-century invention, often used in cinema or other media to refer to men in the American Old West who had gained a reputation as being dangerous with a gun. A gunfighter may or may not be an outlaw or a lawman. An outlaw had usually been convicted of a crime, such as Black Bart, but may have only gained a reputation as operating outside the law, such as Ike Clanton. Some of those listed may have also served in law enforcement, like Marshal Burt Alvord who subsequently became an outlaw, and some outlaws like Johnny Ringo were deputized at one time or another. Some of the gunfighters listed included professionals, scouts, businessmen, and even doctors. ==Outlaws== The majority of outlaws in the Old West preyed on banks, trains, and stagecoaches. Some crimes were carried out by Mexicans and Native Americans against white citizens who were targets of opportunity along the U.S.–Mexico border, particularly in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. For example, Pancho Villa was a bandit from Durango, Mexico who also conducted cross-border raids into New Mexico and Texas. Some individuals, like Jesse James, became outlaws after serving in the Civil War. Some were simply men who took advantage of the wildness and lawlessness of the frontier to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Some outlaws migrated to the frontier to escape prosecution for crimes elsewhere. ==Lawmen== Law was present, if spread thin, in the American Old West. It was usually present on three levels: the Deputy U.S. Marshal, the county sheriff, and the town marshal or constable. Sometimes their jurisdictions overlapped which could lead to conflicts like those between Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp and Cochise County, Arizona Sheriff Johnny Behan. When an outlaw committed a crime, the local sheriff or marshal would usually form a posse to attempt to capture them. Rewards were posted for outlaws which encouraged citizens to capture or kill them for the reward, leading to the profession of bounty hunter – people who would find and capture/kill those with a bounty placed on their head by the law. == A == * John Hicks Adams (1820–1878) * Robert Clay Allison (1840–1887) * Burt Alvord (1867–1910) * Charlie Anderson (1844–1868) * David L. \\"Billy Wilson\\" Anderson (1862–1918) * Peter Alston (1765–1804) == B == * Cullen Baker (1835–1869) * Nick Barkley (1860–1915) * Seaborn Barnes (1849?–1878) * Richard H. \\"Rattlesnake Dick\\" Bartar (1833–1859) * Sam Bass (1851–1878) * \\"Queen\\" Ann Bassett (1878–1956) * Charlie Bassett (1847–1896) * Josie Bassett (1874–1964) * Tom Bell (1825–1856) * Jules Beni (??–1861) * John Billee (??–1890) * William \\"Tulsa Jack\\" Blake (c.1859–1895) * Thomas Hamilton Blanek {1861–1895} * Dan Bogan (1860–??) * Charles \\"Black Bart\\" Bolles (1829–??) * William H. \\"Billy the Kid\\" Bonney (1859–1881) * N.

Shooto was originally formed in 1985, as an organization and as a particular fighting system derived from shoot wrestling. Practitioners are referred to as shooters, similarly to practitioners of shoot wrestling. Shooto rules have evolved such that their events are now true mixed martial arts competitions. The word shooto is an English transliteration of 修斗 (pronounced shū-to), an ateji derived from the English word \\"shoot\\". The word shooto contains 修 meaning to practice or train in, and 斗 which is just used for its pronunciation, as its literal meaning is a spoon or ladle. Shooto weight classes are different from those of the United States Association of Boxing Commissions, which are used by most MMA promotions. In 2019 Shooto entered into a partnership with ONE Championship. Under the terms of the partnership, Shooto champions will have the opportunity to sign a contract with ONE, while their amateur champions will be given an opportunity to train at Evolve MMA for a year. ==History== Shooto was established as a \\"New Martial arts\\" (Shin- Kakutōgi) in 1985 by Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask), a Japanese professional wrestler trained in shoot wrestling, who wished to create a sport that revolved around a realistic and effective fighting system. After its establishment, New Martial arts was renamed \\"Shooting\\" which came from Shoot, a term of professional wrestling meaning \\"Serious match\\", but this changed to \\"Shooto\\" to avoid confusion with Shooting sports. Compared with the other professional wrestling organizations of the time, such as the New Japan Pro Wrestling and the Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan), Shooto was aimed at having no predetermined results. The first amateur event was held in 1986 and the first professional event in 1989. The Shooto organization hosted the Vale Tudo Japan tournament in the summer of 1994. Previously to this tournament, Shooto did not feature punches to the face in a ground position, but after seeing effective usage of punching by foreign participants, Sayama decided to incorporate these striking techniques into shooto. In April 1996, World Shooto, the Shooto Association and the International Shooto Commission were formed. This marked the end of Shooto as a single organization, and turned it into a combat sport with governing bodies. Since establishment of ISC, the champions of Shooto are called \\"World Champion\\". Vale Tudo Japan events were held annually from 1994 to 1999. In May 2009, it was announced that Vale Tudo Japan would return for the first time in ten years on October 30, 2009. Shooto was brought to America in the late 1980s by top student of Satoru Sayama, Yorinaga Nakamura. He began teaching Shooto at the Inosanto Academy in 1991, and is the instructor of Erik Paulson, Ron Balicki, Dan Inosanto, Larry Hartsell, and many others. Shooto South America, also known as ShootoBazil is managed by founder of Nova União mixed martial arts academy, André Pederneiras. Its first event was held in Rio de Janeiro in May 2002 There has been an ongoing effort, spearheaded by Rich Santoro, to promote Shooto competition into the United States and Canada. He was officially named the Director of the International Shooto Commission - SHOOTO Americas division (the North American branch of the Shooto Association) in 2001. He has worked with both U.S. event promoters and state officials to spread the Shooto brand of competition throughout North America. As of 2006 Shooto has taken place in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, Nevada, Hawaii, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Promoters of Shooto events in North America have been HOOKnSHOOT, The Ironheart Crown, Midwest Fighting, Tennessee Shooto, RSF Shooto Challenge, TUFF-N-UFF, World Freestyle Fighting, SHOOTO Hawaii and Mannidog Productions. Previous to 2009, Shooto's rules included a knockdown rule giving knocked down fighters an eight-count to recover as well as allowing strikes to the back of the head. Shooto had argued that the potential for a knocked out (and thus unconscious) fighter to receive unnecessary damage while on the ground necessitated the rule, but with Shooto being one of the lone organizations still having the rule, consideration of the potential for injury allowing a knocked down fighter time to recover thus allowing additional blows, and with the original vision of Shooto's founder being a synthesis of striking, throwing and submitting - the rule change was instituted in mid-2008. The disallowment of strikes to the back of the head was done for similar medical reasons. The long-running Japanese league Shooto and sister organization Vale Tudo Japan live-streamed its first shows on UFC Fight Pass in 2016. Vale Tudo Japan bouts are contested in a cage instead of Shooto's traditional ring, Broadcast schedules for both promotions were announced April 20, 2016 during a press conference in Tokyo. Shooto made its Fight Pass debut Saturday, April 23, with “Fight & Mosh” live from Maihama Amphitheater in Urayasu, Japan. Two world titles were on the line, Masaaki Sugawara made his first defense of the 125-pound belt against Hiromasa Ogikubo, plus Koshi Matsumoto and Yuki Kawana vied for the vacant 155-pound mantle. Shooto followed that up with events on July 17 and Nov. 12, both took place at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo as well as VTJ in Osaka” June 19 at Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium, and “VTJ 9th” on Sept. 19 which saw the organization return to its birthplace of Chiba prefecture. ==Techniques and strategies== The aim in a shooto match is to defeat the opponent by a knockout or a submission, but fights can also end in a referee stoppage or by a judge decision. Legal techniques include general grappling, chokeholds, joint locks, kicks, knee strikes, punches, takedowns and throws. Illegal techniques include biting, elbow strikes, eye-gouging, forearm strikes, hair pulling, headbutting, kicking or kneeing the head of a downed opponent, small joint manipulation, strikes to the groin or throat and since September 1, 2008, strikes to the back of the head. ==Fighter classes== Shooto fighters are categorized into four Classes. * Class-D : Amateur (2x2min, Headgear, Special point system) * Class-C : Amateur (2x3min, Headgear, Special point system) * Class-C+: Amateur (2x3min) * Class-B : Pro (2x5min) * Class-A : Pro (3x5min) Fighters start out as Class-D or Class-C fighters and enter amateur competitions that Shooto hosts together with the help of local gyms all over Japan. Class-D Shooto does not allow knee strikes to the face or striking on the ground. Class-C Shooto does not allow striking on the ground, but knee strikes to the head are allowed. There are regional championship and once a year the All-Japan amateur championships. Then a fighter can get a Class-B pro license, these fights are 2x5 minute long and use the same rules as Class-A fights. Shooto holds yearly rookie tournaments in each weight class. When a fighter has gathered enough wins and experience in Class-B he will get awarded with a Class-A license, as a sign that he's part of the elite professional fighters. ==Shooto events== Shooto organize most of their events in Japan, although it has organized some amateur tournaments in China.. Domestically, it broadcasts its events over AbemaTV and Samurai TV. Internationally, it has broadcast over the UFC Fight Pass in the past, and a number of their events are part of the UFC Fight Library. Recently, they have put up their events on YouTube. ==Current Shooto world champions== { style=\\"border-collapse: collapse;\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" - ccc;\\" ! Men's division !

Elementary Surveying, 11th ed., 2006 Various lengths are commonly used in different areas of practice. This angle is also the change in forward direction as that portion of the curve is traveled. ==Usage== Curvature is usually measured in radius of curvature. A small circle can be easily laid out by just using radius of curvature, But if the radius is large as a km or a mile, degree of curvature is more convenient for calculating and laying out the curve of large scale works like roads and railroads. By this method curve setting can be easily done with the help of a transit or theodolite and a chain, tape or rope of a prescribed length. In an n-degree curve, the forward bearing changes by n degrees over the standard length of arc or chord. The usual distance in North American road work is of arc.Davis, Foote, and Kelly. Surveying Theory and Practice, 1966 North American railroad work traditionally used 100 feet of chord and this may be used in other places for road work. Other lengths may be used—such as 30 metres or 100 metres where SI is favoured, or a shorter length for sharper curves. Where degree of curvature is based on 100 units of arc length, the conversion between degree of curvature and radius is , where is degree and is radius. As an example, a curve with an arc length of 600 units that has an overall sweep of 6 degrees is a 1-degree curve: For every 100 feet of arc, the bearing changes by 1 degree. The radius of such a curve is 5729.57795. If the chord definition is used each 100-unit chord length will sweep 1 degree with a radius of 5729.651 units, and the chord of the whole curve will be slightly shorter than 600 units. Since rail routes have very large radii, they are laid out in chords, as the difference to the arc is inconsequential and this made work easier before electronic calculators became available. The is called a station, used to define length along a road or other alignment, annotated as stations plus feet 1+00, 2+00 etc. Metric work may use similar notation, such as kilometers plus meters 1+000. ==Formulas for radius of curvature== Degree of curvature can be converted to radius of curvature by the following formulae: Diagram showing different parts of the curve used in the formula ===Formula from arc length=== r = \\\\frac{180 A}{\\\\pi D_C} where A is arc length, r is radius of curvature and D_C is degree of curvature, arc definition Substitute deflection angle for degree of curvature or make arc length equal to 100 feet. ===Formula from chord length=== r = \\\\frac{C}{2 \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{D_C}{2} \\\\right) } where C is chord length, r is radius of curvature and D_C is degree of curvature, chord definition ===Formula from radius=== D_C = 5729.58/r == See also == * Geometric design of roads * Highway engineering * Lateral motion device * Minimum railway curve radius * Radius of curvature (applications) * Railway systems engineering * Track geometry * Track transition curve * Transition curve * Turning radius == References == == External links == Note the variation in usage among these samples. *https://web.archive.org/web/20050212195231/http://du.edu/~jcalvert/railway/degcurv.htm *http://www.tpub.com/content/engineering/14071/css/14071_242.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20050223171348/http://www.steamlocomotive.com/model/curve.html *http://www.cee.mtu.edu/~balkire/ce3401tc/ce3401Lec20.doc *http://www.trainweb.org/freemoslo/Modules/Tips-and- Techniques/degrees_of_curve.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20041213192255/http://www.fairview- industries.com/standardmodule/circurve.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20050304064535/http://ceprofs.tamu.edu/rbruner/curves/circularcrvs.htm *http://www.memun.org/SchoolsProject/html/Resources/Roads/Fundamentals.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20040917090858/http://www.cityoffrederick.com/departments/Planning/APPENDIX_C_SUBDIVISION_REGULATIONS/Sec__5__Final_subdivision_plat.html Category:Surveying Category:Transportation engineering Category:Track geometry ","title":"Degree of curvature"},{"id":"1438533","text":"In sociolinguistics, a register is a variety of language used for a particular purpose or in a particular communicative situation. For example, when speaking officially or in a public setting, an English speaker may be more likely to follow prescriptive norms for formal usage than in a casual setting: for example by pronouncing words ending in -ing with a velar nasal instead of an alveolar nasal (e.g. \\"walking\\", not \\"walkin), choosing words that are considered more \\"formal\\" (such as father vs. dad, or child vs. kid), and refraining from using words considered nonstandard, such as ain't. As with other types of language variation, there tends to be a spectrum of registers rather than a discrete set of obviously distinct varieties—numerous registers can be identified, with no clear boundaries between them. Discourse categorisation is a complex problem, and even in the general definition of \\"register\\" given above (language variation defined by use not user), there are cases where other kinds of language variation, such as regional or age dialect, overlap. Due to this complexity, scholarly consensus has not been reached for the definitions of terms such as \\"register\\", \\"field\\" or \\"tenor\\"; different scholars' definitions of these terms are often in direct contradiction of each other. Additional terms such as diatype, genre, text types, style, acrolect, mesolect, basilect, sociolect and ethnolect, among many others, may be used to cover the same or similar ground. Some prefer to restrict the domain of the term \\"register\\" to a specific vocabulary (Wardhaugh, 1986) (which one might commonly call slang, jargon, argot or cant), while others argue against the use of the term altogether (e.g. Crystal and Davy 1969, who critiqued the way the term has been used \\"in an almost indiscriminate manner\\"). These various approaches with their own \\"register\\", or set of terms and meanings, fall under disciplines such as sociolinguistics, stylistics (e.g. Wardhaugh 1986), pragmatics (Joos 1961) or systemic functional grammar (Halliday and Hasan 1976). ==History and use== The term register was first used by the linguist T.B.W. Reid in 1956 (Agha, 2008), and brought into general currency in the 1960s by a group of linguists who wanted to distinguish among variations in language according to the user (defined by variables such as social background, geography, sex and age), and variations according to use, \\"in the sense that each speaker has a range of varieties and choices between them at different times\\" (Halliday et al., 1964). The focus is on the way language is used in particular situations, such as legalese or motherese, the language of a biology research lab, of a news report, or of the bedroom. M. A. K. Halliday and R. Hasan (1976) interpret register as \\"the linguistic features which are typically associated with a configuration of situational features – with particular values of the field, mode and tenor...\\". Field for them is \\"the total event, in which the text is functioning, together with the purposive activity of the speaker or writer; includes subject-matter as one of the elements\\". Mode is \\"the function of the text in the event, including both the channel taken by language – spoken or written, extempore or prepared – and its genre, rhetorical mode, as narrative, didactic, persuasive, 'phatic communion', etc.\\" The tenor refers to \\"the type of role interaction, the set of relevant social relations, permanent and temporary, among the participants involved\\". These three values – field, mode and tenor – are thus the determining factors for the linguistic features of the text. \\"The register is the set of meanings, the configuration of semantic patterns, that are typically drawn upon under the specified conditions, along with the words and structures that are used in the realization of these meanings.\\" Register, in the view of M. A. K. Halliday and R. Hasan, is one of the two defining concepts of text. \\"A text is a passage of discourse which is coherent in these two regards: it is coherent with respect to the context of situation, and therefore consistent in register; and it is coherent with respect to itself, and therefore cohesive.\\" ==Register as formality scale== One of the most analyzed areas where the use of language is determined by the situation is the formality scale. The term \\"register\\" is often, in language teaching especially, shorthand for formal/informal style, although this is an aging definition. Linguistics textbooks may use the term \\"tenor\\" instead (Halliday 1978), but increasingly prefer the term \\"style\\" – \\"we characterise styles as varieties of language viewed from the point of view of formality\\" (Trudgill, 1992) – while defining \\"registers\\" more narrowly as specialist language use related to a particular activity, such as academic jargon. There is very little agreement as to how the spectrum of formality should be divided. In one prominent model, Martin Joos (1961) describes five styles in spoken English: * Frozen: Also referred to as static register. Printed unchanging language, such as Biblical quotations, often contains archaisms. Examples are the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America and other \\"static\\" vocalizations. The wording is exactly the same every time it is spoken. * Formal: One-way participation; no interruption; technical vocabulary or exact definitions are important; includes presentations or introductions between strangers. * Consultative: Two-way participation; background information is provided – prior knowledge is not assumed. \\"Back-channel behavior\\" such as \\"uh huh\\", \\"I see\\", etc. is common. Interruptions are allowed. For example teacher/student, doctor/patient, or expert/apprentice. * Casual: In-group friends and acquaintances; no background information provided; ellipsis and slang common; interruptions common. This is common among friends in a social setting. * Intimate: Non-public; intonation more important than wording or grammar; private vocabulary. Also includes non- verbal messages. This is most common among family members and close friends. ==ISO standard== The ISO has defined standard ISO 12620 on Data Category Registry (ISO, 2018). This is a registry for registering linguistic terms used in various fields of translation, computational linguistics and natural language processing and defining mappings both between different terms and the same terms used in different systems. The registers identified are: * bench- level register * dialect register * facetious register * formal register * in- house register * ironic register * neutral register * slang register * taboo register * technical register * vulgar register ==Diatype== The term diatype is sometimes used to describe language variation which is determined by its social purpose (Gregory 1967). In this formulation, language variation can be divided into two categories: dialect, for variation according to user, and diatype for variation according to use (e.g. the specialised language of an academic journal). This definition of diatype is very similar to those of register. The distinction between dialect and diatype is not always clear; in some cases a language variety may be understood as both a dialect and a diatype. Diatype is usually analysed in terms of field, the subject matter or setting; tenor, the participants and their relationships; and mode, the channel of communication, such as spoken, written or signed. ==See also== * Child-directed speech * Code-switching * Colloquialism * Diglossia * Elderspeak * Etiquette * Honorifics (linguistics) - politeness markers * Honorific speech in Japanese * Korean speech levels * Literary language * Prestige (sociolinguistics) * Tone (literature) * Vernacular ==References== * Crystal, D. and D.

Their music style was largely influenced by hardcore punk bands such as Refused, metalcore bands such as Cave In, and the mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan. After being a band for only two months, the band released an EP titled His First Crush with Ride the Rocket Records and Sunset Alliance, and released a self-titled EP a year later, both of which featured Adam Goss on vocals. The Bled quickly began to build a name for themselves in Tucson, Arizona, and started to play sold out shows.The Bled on Vagrant Retrieved on 2008-04-26.The Bled on Purevolume Retrieved on 2008-04-26. ===Pass the Flask (2003–2004)=== After achieving local success, The Bled caught the attention of Fiddler Records and later got signed. A day before the band started to record their debut album Pass the Flask, vocalist Adam Goss quit the band and suggested James Muñoz as a replacement. The rest of the band felt that Muñoz was a much better fit than Goss, and he became a permanent member of the band. Pass the Flask was released in July 2003 and the band toured doghounds relentlessly in support of it. This also marked the first time The Bled left Arizona to tour as a band. The album demonstrated The Bled's skills in both a lyrical sense and music sense as the band incorporated a wide variety of genres including metalcore, mathcore, melodic hardcore, and post-hardcore. The album was also a major success within the hardcore community. ===Found in the Flood (2005–2007)=== The Bled was not content with Fiddler Records, and decided to change labels. The band was a big fan of Vagrant Records, and in 2005 they signed to the indie record label, ensuring that a major label was not for them. Before working on their new album, the band parted ways with bass player Mike Celi and hired Darren Simoes as a permanent replacement. For their second studio album, Found in the Flood, The Bled worked with producer Mark Trombino (Jimmy Eat World, Blink-182). The album expanded both the heavier and lighter sides of the band. This album is also their first album to chart on the Billboard 200, which peaked at No. 87.[ The Bled on AMG] Retrieved on 2008-04-26. The success of the album landed The Bled a spot on Warped Tour in the summer of 2006 on the Vagrant Stage featuring many rising names signed to Vagrant Records, and the international Taste of Chaos in early 2007 alongside bands like Rise Against, The Used, and Aiden. During this time Pass the Flask went out of print. The Bled was unable to sell it on tour because it was released on their previous label (that has since gone out of business). Many fans believed that Found in the Flood was the band's first and only album. To fix this, a reissue of Pass the Flask was created. The new version was released on Vagrant, and in addition to the original track listing the new album featured songs from The Bled's original EPs and three unreleased songs. ===Silent Treatment (2007–2008)=== After touring on the Taste of Chaos tour, the band started working on their new album. The process of writing and recording was slightly different from previous efforts. For the first two albums, Muñoz and Talley each wrote half an album worth of songs individually. For Silent Treatment Muñoz and Talley wrote songs together. The band also had five months to write songs for the album, the longest writing period to date for any album. While recording, The Bled set up a live webcam in the studio so fans could watch the progress. Silent Treatment was produced by Brian McTernan (Thrice, Converge) and featured a more evolved and heavy sound than what is found on Pass the Flask in addition to the slower melodic songs found on Found in the Flood. Shortly before the release of Silent Treatment, The Bled toured in the 2007 Projekt Revolution Tour alongside Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday and others.Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution 2007 Retrieved on 2008-04-26. After the album was released they toured the Take Action Tour with Every Time I Die and From First to Last followed by a short tour supporting The Dillinger Escape Plan. On April 18, while playing with the Dillinger Escape Plan at Ridglea Theater in Fort Worth, TX, vocalist James Muñoz told the crowd \\"this is our last tour for a long while\\" due to mutual exhaustion among the band members from extensive touring over the past year and financial turmoil within the band. During the hiatus, bassist Darren Simoes toured with New York hardcore act Warship alongside Reggie and the Full Effect, and guitarist Jeremy Ray formed the band Starving Arms with past members of the bands The Funeral March and Versus the Mirror. ===Lineup changes, Heat Fetish and break up (2009–2011)=== After touring in support of Silent Treatment, The Bled found themselves in debt. Each band member found a way outside of The Bled to earn money, such as getting regular jobs or playing in other bands. The end result was that three core members decided to no longer be a part of the band. Mike Pedicone joined Gavin Rossdale as drummer, Ross Ott started working for a company called ArtistForce, and Darren Simoes decided to finish college. These members were replaced by Robbie Burbidge, Brad Murray, Josh Skibar.Kohli, Rohan. \\"The Bled Announces Line-Up Changes\\" AbsolutePunk. Retrieved on February 2, 2009. The band recorded their follow-up to Silent Treatment after their spring tour with The Used, and proceeded to tour in support of the new album this summer. On March 30, it was reported by Alternative Press Magazine that The Bled had been dropped from their label, Vagrant Records. On March 31, The Bled put up two demo tracks on their MySpace titled \\"Mouthbreather\\" and \\"When Exiting Your Vehicle.\\" It was confirmed that the two demos would be on the new record. On September 4, The Bled embarked on their first nationwide tour in over a year.

On May 8, 2010, it was announced that Shane Sheffer, vocalist of The Fade and formerly of The Funeral March and Starving Arms, would be replacing bassist Brad Murray on the Rise Records Tour and that Murray is no longer a part of The Bled. After the Rise Records tour, Mike Patton, a close friend to the band, their touring sound engineer and of no relation to Mike Patton of Faith No More, was picked to fill in on bass until further notice. The Bled announced their breakup in August 2011 stating that it was, \\"time to move on to new things.\\" A tour took place in November 2011, with the final four shows taking place in the United Kingdom. The band played their final show on February 19, 2012. Guitarist Jeremy Talley announced via the band's Facebook that he will be forming a new project based around material intended for The Bled's final release. Talley also said information regarding this project will be released following The Bled's farewell tour. Vocalist James Munoz has moved on to writing and acting in the weekly FunnyOrDie comedy sketch show, Apartment Sketch Show, as well as playing bass for the Richmond, Virginia punk rock band, Smoke or Fire. ==Band members== ;Final lineup * Jeremy Ray Talley – guitar (2001–2012) * James Muñoz – vocals (2003–2012) * Robbie Burbidge – guitar (2009–2012) * Josh Skibar – drums (2009–2012) * Mike Patton – bass guitar (2011–2012) ;Former members * Mike Celi – bass guitar (2001–2004) * Adam Goss – vocals (2001–2003) * Brad Murray – bass guitar (2009–2010) * Ross Ott – guitar (2001–2008) * Mike Pedicone – drums (2001–2008) * Darren Simoes – bass guitar (2004–2008) * Shane Sheffer – bass guitar (2010–2011) Timeline ImageSize =width:800 height:auto barincrement:25 PlotArea =left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:10 Alignbars =justify DateFormat =mm/dd/yyyy Period =from:01/01/2001 till:02/19/2012 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2002 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2001 TimeAxis =orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend =orientation:horizontal position:bottom Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_album id:ep value:gray(0.5) legend:EP id:bars value:gray(0.95) LineData= layer:back color:studio at:07/29/2003 at:08/23/2005 at:09/25/2007 at:03/09/2010 color:ep at:07/01/2001 at:02/02/2002 BarData= bar:Adam text:\\"Adam Goss\\" bar:James text:\\"James Muñoz\\" bar:Jeremy text:\\"Jeremy Ray Talley\\" bar:Ross text:\\"Ross Ott\\" bar:Robbie text:\\"Robbie Burbidge\\" bar:Mike text:\\"Mike Celi\\" bar:Darren text:\\"Darren Simoes\\" bar:Brad text:\\"Brad Murray\\" bar:Shane text:\\"Shane Sheffer\\" bar:Mike2 text:\\"Mike Patton\\" bar:Mike3 text:\\"Mike Pedicone\\" bar:Josh text:\\"Josh Skibar\\" BackgroundColors = bars:bars PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Adam from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2003 color:vocals bar:James from:01/02/2003 till:end color:vocals bar:Jeremy from:01/01/2001 till:end color:guitar bar:Ross from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2008 color:guitar bar:Robbie from:01/01/2009 till:end color:guitar bar:Mike from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2004 color:bass bar:Darren from:01/02/2004 till:01/01/2008 color:bass bar:Brad from:01/01/2009 till:06/01/2010 color:bass bar:Shane from:06/02/2010 till:01/01/2011 color:bass bar:Mike2 from:01/02/2011 till:end color:bass bar:Mike3 from:01/01/2001 till:01/01/2008 color:drums bar:Josh from:01/01/2009 till:end color:drums ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Pass the Flask (2003) *Found in the Flood (2005) *Silent Treatment (2007) *Heat Fetish (2010) ;EPs *His First Crush (2001) *The Bled (2002) ;Split EPs *Alexisonfire / The Bled *The Bled / From Autumn to Ashes ;Non-album tracks *Masters of Horror – \\"Nervous Breakdown\\" (Black Flag cover) *Tony Hawk's American Wasteland Soundtrack – \\"House of Suffering\\" (Bad Brains cover) *Resident Evil: Extinction Soundtrack – \\"Asleep on the Frontlines\\" (Appliantz remix) ;Music Videos * You Know Who's Seatbelt (2003) * I Never Met Another Gemini (2003) * My Assassin (2005) * The Last American Cowboy (2005) * Shadetree Mechanics (2007) * Mouthbreather (2010) * Smoke Breaks (2010) ==References== ==External links== * The Bled 2008 interview with TheGrixer.com * The Bled interview at lambgoat.com * Interview with James Munoz of The Bled * The Bled Interview (June 2008) * The Bled talk new album (Nov. 2009) Category:American metalcore musical groups Category:American mathcore musical groups Category:Music of Tucson, Arizona Category:Musical groups from Tucson, Arizona Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2012 Category:Rise Records artists Category:2001 establishments in Arizona ","title":"The Bled"},{"id":"1438541","text":"Hugh Le Caine in the Centre for Electronic Music in Israel, Jerusalem (1962) Hugh Le Caine (May 27, 1914 – July 3, 1977) was a Canadian physicist, composer, and instrument builder. Le Caine was brought up in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) in northwestern Ontario. At a young age, he began making musical instruments. In youth, he started imagining \\"beautiful sounds\\". He attended high school in Port Arthur at Port Arthur Collegiate Institute (P.A.C.I.). After completing his master of science degree from Queen's University in 1939, Le Caine was awarded a National Research Council of Canada (NRC) fellowship to continue his work on atomic physics measuring devices at Queen's. He worked with the NRC in Ottawa from 1940 to 1974. During World War II, he assisted in the development of the first radar systems. On an NRC grant he studied nuclear physics from 1948 to 1952 in England. Le Caine wanted to devise new ways to produce those \\"beautiful sounds\\", so he established his own electronic music studio where he began to build new electronic instruments after World War II. ==Works== At home, he pursued a lifelong interest in electronic music and sound generation. In 1937, Le Caine designed an electronic free reed organ, and in the mid-1940s, he built the Electronic Sackbut, now recognised to be one of the first synthesizers. After the success of public demonstrations of his instruments, he was permitted to move his musical activities to the NRC and to work on them full-time in 1954, where he gained funding in order to open ELMUS, the Canadian Electronic Music Laboratory. Over the next twenty years, he built over twenty-two different new instruments and helped Canadian universities establish their own studios in the new electronic music medium. sound synthesizer) aka \\"Multi-track\\" Josef Tal with Hugh Le Caine's Creative Tape Recorder (after modification) One of Le Caine's most notable inventions was the Special Purpose Tape Recorder (later renamed the \\"Multi-track.\\"). Experiments with his recorder led the composition of Dripsody in 1955. The subtitle of the piece is \\"An Étude for Variable Speed Recorder\\"; Le Caine is acknowledging the musical past with his use of the word étude. French for \\"study\\", it allows an instrument to explore or study a specific technical difficulty. Between 1955 and his retirement from the NRC in 1973, Le Caine produced at least fifteen electroacoustic compositions in order to demonstrate the capabilities of his new devices. He also created a score of new devices and also presented his ideas and inventions to learned bodies and the general public. But while Le Caine did get excellent responses from both the learned bodies and the public, he did not get a satisfactory response from industry. Fortunately, a few people did eventually come into Le Caine's life to make him feel his efforts were of some value. One of these people was Israeli composer Josef Tal. In the summer of 1958, Tal had travelled to Ottawa under a UNESCO grant to visit major electronic music studios. Tal grew very excited about the instruments that Le Caine had built, but he did not realize what this meant to Le Caine until the following day when Le Caine, Tal, and several technicians were having lunch in a small restaurant. Tal noticed that not only had Le Caine been rather silent on this day, but on close inspection at the table, Le Caine had tears running down his cheeks and falling silently into his soup. When an opportunity arose, Tal delicately asked one of the technicians about this and was told that Le Caine had felt no composer in Canada had a use for his instruments and that Tal was the first composer who had shown any interest in his work.David Keane, \\"Electroacoustic Music in Canada: 1950–1984,\\" in eContact! 3.4 — Histoires de l’électroacoustique / Histories of Electroacoustics (2000). http://econtact.ca/3_4/EaMusicCanada.htm In 1962 Le Caine arrived in Jerusalem to install his Creative Tape Recorder in the Centre for Electronic Music in Israel, established by Josef Tal.alcides lanza and Andrew Lewin-Richter, \\"On Hugh Le Caine, Electronic Music Pioneer, Part 3,\\" in Musicworks 83 (Summer 2002), pp. 50–51. Le Caine also collaborated in the development of pioneering electronic music studios at the University of Toronto in 1959 and at McGill University in 1964. ===Dripsody=== Though his composition output was small, Le Caine is remembered as one of the great pioneer composers of musique concrète, his best known work being Dripsody (1955), a piece of musique concrète based on the sound of a single drop of water that over the course of the piece is permuted and contorted into a variety of sounds. Le Caine used a metal wastebasket filled with two inches of water, held an eyedropper ten inches above the wastebasket, and tape-recorded the water drops for thirty minutes. After reviewing the resulting recording, Le Caine selected one of the water drops and spliced it onto a short tape loop. This allowed the water drop to repeat like a traditional ostinato figure. Le Caine wrote down rhythmic figures he felt stimulated the sound of water drops then he decided how loud to make each figure, writing down a corresponding decibel number. He correlated the time values of the rhythms with different lengths of tape. Coming back to the tape recorder, Le Caine used that new tool to perform five kinds of operations or manipulations, all with a different effect. The first operation, which was the changing of tape speed, was his primary technique. The faster the tape is played, the higher the pitch and vice versa. Tape speed is measured by ips or inches per second. So slowing a recording by half (7-1/2-ips), lowers all pitches by an octave. Le Caine created a three-octave keyboard that allows him to choose different speeds. All the different pitches during Dripsody were achieved by changing the tape speed. He, sometime in the process of creating the keyboard, assembled the pitches into a pentatonic (five note) scale pattern. The second operation's objective was to play the recorded sound backwards, reversing the direction of the tape. Acoustically, the effect is to change the amplitude envelope. What we normally experience with amplitude is, for example, pressing a key on a piano, a loud sound emerges then slowly fades away; the second operation's objective is the opposite. Le Caine also used four different tape loops to produce ostinato patterns heard in Dripsody. Three different speeds creates twelve different loops not needing to add additional splices. However, he did use splices as his fourth operation. Splicing different pitches resulted from different playback speeds of initial drop creates a twelve-note arpeggio. Only twenty-five splices were used to compose the piece, which made him very proud, and the multi-track recorder controlled all other variations. The fifth operation was the use of tape delay, not to be confused with the same term used on the television world that means to postpone broadcasts. To Le Caine, it was an echo effect he produced by playing a sound on the recorder while re-recording the sound at the same time. The new recording had a lower amplitude and created an echo-like sound. Le Caine spent one night manipulating his initial \\"drop\\" sound. The overall work could be considered programmatic, it is similar to the ebb and flow of a rain shower. There are various versions since he added a stereo mixing system to the multi-track. Dripsody is one of the most frequently played examples of musique concrète, but Le Caine remained modest. Once when asked why he chose the name Dripsody he replied, \\"Because it was written by a drip.\\" ==Life== He was married to Trudi Le Caine, born Gertrude Janowski, a music educator. Le Caine died in 1977 from injuries in a motorcycle accident at age sixty-three. == Notes == == Further reading == *Le Caine, Hugh. \\"A report from the International Conference of Composers, held at the Stratford Festival [1960].\\" The Modern Composer and his World.

The band released their first EP, Translating the Name in 2003. That same year original vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, Cove Reber replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. With Reber the group recorded its self titled debut album which was released on Capitol Records on September 26, 2006. Their second studio album, In Search of Solid Ground, was released on September 8, 2009 on Virgin Records and contains three re-recorded tracks from The Grey EP. In 2010, Reber was dismissed from the band. In 2013, the band reformed with all original members, except Zach, and began touring. They released Along the Shadow, their third studio album and first studio album with original vocalist Anthony Green, on May 20, 2016 through Epitaph Records. ==Origin of name== Anthony Green had initially suggested the name \\"Saosin\\" for the band. Saosin means \\"careful\\" in Chinese (小心 xiǎo xīn). The word comes from a 15th-century proverb about fathers admonishing their sons who are being married off for money to not get emotionally involved with their wives, as they could die at any time. Green explained the meaning behind this as being a reference to the fact that nothing is eternal, and that it is a mistake to become overly attached to any one or thing, because that thing will eventually be lost. While Green's personal interpretation of the word 小心 is obscure, 小心 is generally used in Chinese as a means to express caution. Green had previously used \\"Saosin\\" as a track name in his high school band, Audience of One, I Remember When This All Meant Something. ==History== ===Formation and Translating the Name (2003–2004)=== The original lineup for Saosin, consisting of Burchell, Shekoski, Kennedy and Green, was formed in the summer of 2003. On June 17, the band released their first commercial production, the EP Translating the Name. It was an immediate success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites. Saosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the Internet. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as MySpace. The E.P. has sold an estimated 62,000 copies. Bassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art. He was later replaced by Chris Sorenson. A local Southern Californian drummer by the name of Pat Magrath was hired only for the recording for the EP, according to Burchell. The band was impressed with his drumming skills however, and he later appeared as a guest performing Lost Symphonies live with the band. Alex Rodriguez was unable to record Translating the Name as he had promised his band at the time Open Hand he would finish recording with them. Danny King filled in for live drums with the band before Rodriguez completed his responsibilities with Open Hand and joined Saosin full-time after the EP release. Saosin went on a U.S. tour with bands Boys Night Out and Anatomy of a Ghost shortly after the release of Translating the Name. In February 2004, the band's vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin and later formed the band Circa Survive. Green was homesick, depressed and said he was missing his family. Green was also disenchanted with the direction of Saosin and disliked that the band excluded him from the writing process. The band finished their Warped Tour obligations with Story of the Year's Philip Sneed taking the mic. A public, nationwide audition then took place. ===Arrival of Cove Reber and Saosin EP (2004–2006)=== After the audition process and several guest vocalists on demos, the then 19-year-old Cove Reber was announced as their new permanent lead singer. Reber had sent in his demo tape, which was an acoustic demo with \\"Mookie's Last Christmas\\". The demo has since leaked onto the internet. It is widely speculated to have included a few songs from Translating the Name. When Beau Burchell first heard the demo, he thought it was Anthony playing a trick on them, as Reber's vocal stylings were very similar to those of Green's when the demo was originally recorded. In an interview with PlayPro.com, Reber commented that \\"everyone I've played with wants to make music their lives...Saosin is a band on a completely different level. All these dudes are freaks about music.\\" Reber's addition to the band was difficult, for the more experienced Green was the center piece of the band in the eyes of Saosin's fans. Many fans consider the time with Green to be something entirely different from the time with Reber. There are still distinct fans of both eras (Green Era/Reber Era) debating on which is a better fit for the band as a whole. Saosin played the Taste of Chaos tour the following winter. Saosin was signed to Capitol Records in March and toured the United States with the Warped Tour for the second time. That summer, they released the Saosin EP. At first it was intended to be a free sampler, but Capitol Records would not allow this and released it as an EP. It contained demo versions of songs later recorded on their first full-length album. A video to their new single \\"Bury Your Head\\" was filmed during the tour. The band continued touring for the rest of 2005, opening for Avenged Sevenfold and Coheed and Cambria. === Saosin LP and Come Close (2006–2008) === After a respite from touring between February and June, the Warped Tour 2006 and numerous demos and compilation appearances, Saosin released their first full- length album Saosin on September 26, 2006. The well-known music producer Howard Benson was hired for the production of the album. Benson had worked with several major rock bands such as My Chemical Romance and Blindside. During the rest of 2006, Saosin toured on the International Taste of Chaos Tour, playing their first shows outside of America. They also toured the United States with Bleeding Through and Senses Fail. They kept on touring for the whole year of 2007, beginning with a tour with Senses Fail, Alexisonfire, The Sleeping and Drop Dead, Gorgeous. Saosin also invited the non-profit organization Invisible Children for a portion of the tour. In February they joined the Taste of Chaos 2007 tour. Between April and June they toured in Europe, Australia, Japan and Indonesia. When Saosin returned home they continued their headlining tour with Poison the Well, The Receiving End of Sirens, Fiore and Flight 409. In the later summer of 2007, they were part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour. After this they headlined yet another tour in USA and Canada with Alexisonfire, Envy on the Coast, Norma Jean and The Dear and Departed. Concert footage was recorded during the tour stop on November 3, 2007 at The Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The concert footage was compiled for a live album and concert movie entitled Come Close. Saosin toured from January 26 to February 8, 2008 with Armor for Sleep, Meriwether, and The Bled; from February 9 to 16 Fear Before joined the tour. They went to Australia between February and March, after which they performed in Singapore on March 7 as the opening performance for Incubus on their Light Grenades Tour. On their way home they also visited Bali, Hawaii and Mexico. After two final shows at home in California in April, they took a nine-month break from touring. ===The Grey EP and In Search of Solid Ground (2008–2010)=== Saosin returned to touring in October 2008 alongside Underoath and The Devil Wears Prada. In early 2009, they started recording a new album with producer Butch Walker. They partnered with Hurley to broadcast the recording process live on Hurley's website. Saosin released a new EP titled The Grey EP on October 14, 2008. The EP was sold on tour and on iTunes and featured three new demos, as well as an acoustic version of \\"Come Close\\". The purpose of The Grey EP was to show demos they had been recording; a similar manner in which the Saosin EP contained demos for their debut LP. Saosin released In Search of Solid Ground on September 8, 2009. Two songs were released as a download to anyone who bought a shirt, and a digital pre-order. The songs were \\"On My Own\\" and \\"Is This Real\\". These two songs were released as singles on iTunes August 4, 2009. On August 5 a new song titled \\"Changing\\" was made available for streaming on the internet. The single was then put up for download on iTunes August 11. Another track titled \\"The Worst of Me\\" was also released as part of a free Warped Tour song package on hurley.com/warpedtour. The song \\"Why Can't You See?\\" was made available on Last.fm. \\"Move Slow\\" was released on the TV show, NCISs original soundtrack. \\"Deep Down\\" was released in May 2010. Saosin toured Australia nationally during June 2010 in support of Story Of The Year's Australian tour. Blessthefall also joined Story Of The Year and Saosin. Three unreleased Saosin songs have leaked onto the internet through the Hurley Live Recording Stream they broadcast while recording In Search of Solid Ground. Fans have titled them \\"The Norma Jean Song,\\" \\"Back to Greatness\\" and the third is still known as \\"Untitled\\". Recently, Saosin stated on Twitter that they have parted ways with Virgin records and are going back into a \\"DIY\\" direction. ===The departure of Cove Reber and inactivity (2010–2014)=== Saosin with Cove Reber, live on Projekt Revolution Tour, in 2007 On July 21, 2010, guitarist Beau Burchell made the following announcement: > \\"Well, a few days ago, Alex, Justin, Chris and I got back into the studio > for our first group writing/jam session. We have all been writing things on > our own, but it was cool to get into a room and play with loud amps all > together again. I am very excited about this record, for a few different > reasons. After 5 years with Cove, we have decided to part ways. So it will > be a new experience for us, not knowing what to expect in the vocal dept, > who will replace him, or if we will even find a replacement this century.\\" Reber was asked to leave due to his diminishing stage performance and vocal abilities. According to Justin Shekoski, \\"We didn't feel he could represent the music that we have recorded well on stage.\\" Cove Reber is now lead vocalist for the band Dead American. > \\"finished Two NEW Songs, Instrumentals, ones called JUD JUD JUD. Lots of > Riffs, Rolls and ROFLCOPTERS. Might put one up in a few days. STOKED! - > Beau\\" On November 25, it was reported that Charles Furney, lead singer of Secret and Whisper, had been recruited to fill Reber's abandoned vocalist spot. One day later, on November 26, Saosin themselves denied these claims on their Facebook page: > Thanks for the update from strike gently But, unfortunately, we DO NOT have > a new singer yet, and its not Chris from Secret & Whisper. INFORMATION > POLLUTION!- SAOSIN There has been speculation that Tides of Man vocalist, Tilian Pearson, will audition for Saosin's vacant position. Pearson confirmed rumors that he was kicked out of Tides of Man due to him expressing an interest in pursuing the vacant lead vocalist role in Saosin. Justin Shekoski has also confirmed the speculation and clarified by saying: > \\"Here's the truth, since I can't stand rumors. Tilian has been hitting us > up. A lot. It looks like he wants the job pretty badly if he would quit his > band. BUT....the REALITY is we haven't even met the guy in person. Everybody > is talking about step No. 54 (joining the band). A new demo was leaked on the internet, fuelling speculation that Pearson had joined the band and begun recording. In an interview with Mind Equals Blown, Pearson revealed that the leaked demo is a track Saosin bassist Chris Sorenson had been working on, and that he was asked to provide vocals for it. In an interview with Alternative Press, Pearson gave an update on his status with Saosin, and cleared up the rumor of him being an official Saosin member. There were no further announcements of Pearson doing a record with Saosin, nor was there any announcement of him being added as an official member. On February 23, 2012, the band's Twitter account confirmed that they were no longer in search of a new vocalist. On November 18, 2012, Saosin tweeted a picture with the caption \\"Studio stuff #hewfring\\", dispelling rumours of the band's break- up which had begun to circulate due to their inactivity. On December 16, 2012 Anthony Green was joined on stage by Beau and Justin for an encore where they played 'Seven Years'. Green stated it was the first time in nearly ten years that they had played together. On February 21, 2013, Saosin updated their Facebook status \\"To satisfy those who wish to hear more about Saosin, We have written 14 songs. When they are ready, you will be the first to know.\\" A second Tilian Pearson-fronted demo, recorded over the instrumental originally released as a bonus track on the iTunes version of ISOSG entitled \\"Exfoliator,\\" was posted to YouTube on May 7, 2013. Anthony Green was interviewed by AltPress regarding his former group, Saosin, celebrating their ten-year anniversary of Translating The Name EP. In this particular segment, Green was asked if he would ever rejoin Saosin, he said \\"I love those songs and I love singing “Seven Years” when I play solo. I'm not opposed to talking about doing anything in the future. If the timing was right and it was for the right reasons, then I think it could be something really special\\". On January 25, 2014, Beau Burchell tweeted a photo from Hurley Studios indicating that he was tracking drums with Alex Rodriguez. === Anthony Green return, Along the Shadow, line-up changes (2014–present) === It has been announced that Saosin is performing the Skate and Surf festival on May 17, 2014 and West Coast tour on early June 2014 with original vocalist Anthony Green. The band hinted in an interview with Alternative Press that there may be a possible future together with Anthony. The band toured again from January 19, 2015 to January 25, 2015 with Anthony Green on vocals, and played two new songs, as well as stating they are in the process of completing a new full-length album. After 13 years together Justin Shekoski and Saosin parted ways. Shekoski is now the lead guitarist of the band The Used Phil Sgrosso of then-Wovenwar (now As I Lay Dying) will handle lead guitar parts during the upcoming east coast tour for the band. During their 2016 spring tour, Saosin announced that their new album would be released on May 20. On March 16, 2016, they released their music video \\"The Silver String\\", which additionally confirmed that their album Along The Shadow would be available May 20. On April 6, 2016, they released their second music video called \\"Racing Toward A Red Light, which is another track from the upcoming album Along The Shadow. On April 27, 2016, they released their third music video \\"Control and the Urge to Pray\\", which is the third track released from the upcoming album Along The Shadow. On May 20, 2016, Saosin released \\"Along the Shadow\\" on Epitaph Records. On December 16 and 17, 2018, Saosin played at Glass House, Pomona, where the band reunited with their ex-frontman Cove Reber for twos shows. They performed \\"Voices\\", \\"You're Not Alone\\" and a \\"Seven Years\\" duo with Reber and Green. It was the first time in eight years the band had performed on stage with Reber since his departure in 2010.WATCH SAOSIN AND FORMER VOCALIST COVE REBER REUNITE ONSTAGE, Altpress.com ==Musical style== Saosin has been described as post-hardcore, emo, and alternative rock. ==Band members== Current members * Beau Burchell – lead guitar (2015–present), rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2003–present), piano, keyboards (2003; 2010–14) * Alex Rodriguez – drums, percussion (2003–present) * Chris Sorenson – bass, piano, keyboards, backing vocals (2003–present) * Anthony Green – lead vocals, additional guitar, piano, keyboards (2003–04; 2014–present) Current touring musician * Phil Sgrosso – lead and rhythm guitars (2016–present) Former members * Zach Kennedy – bass (2003) * Cove Reber – lead vocals, piano, keyboards, additional guitar, percussion (2004–10) * Justin Shekoski – lead guitar, backing vocals (2003–15) Former touring musicians * Danny King – drums, percussion (2003) * Philip Sneed – lead vocals (2004) * Ken Floyd – rhythm guitar, lead guitar (2010) Session musicians * Pat Magrath – drums, percussion (2003 on Translating the Name) * Tilian Pearson – vocals (2011 on demos) Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:100 top:5 right:15 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/2003 till:12/31/2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2003 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2003 Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals,_additional_guitar id:Backing value:pink legend:Backing_vocals id:Lead value:teal legend:Lead_guitar id:Rhythm value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:Orange legend:Drums id:Percussion value:claret legend:Percussion id:Keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards,_piano id:album value:black legend:Studio_album id:ep value:gray(0.5) legend:EP id:bars value:gray(0.93) BackgroundColors = bars:bars LineData = layer:back at:06/17/2003 color:EP at:08/04/2005 color:EP at:09/26/2006 color:album at:09/08/2009 color:album at:10/14/2008 color:EP at:05/20/2016 color:album BarData = bar:Anthony text:Anthony Green bar:Cove text:Cove Reber bar:Justin text:Justin Shekoski bar:Beau text:Beau Burchell bar:Zach text:Zach Kennedy bar:Chris text:Chris Sorenson bar:Alex text:Alex Rodriguez PlotData= width:11 bar:Anthony from:01/01/2003 till:09/18/2004 color:Vocals bar:Anthony from:01/01/2003 till:09/18/2004 color:Keyboards width:3 bar:Anthony from:12/12/2012 till:12/12/2012 color:Vocals bar:Anthony from:12/12/2012 till:12/12/2012 color:Keyboards width:3 bar:Anthony from:05/17/2014 till:end color:Vocals bar:Anthony from:05/17/2014 till:end color:Keyboards width:3 bar:Cove from:09/18/2004 till:07/21/2010 color:Vocals bar:Cove from:09/18/2004 till:07/21/2010 color:Percussion width:7 bar:Cove from:09/18/2004 till:07/21/2010 color:Keyboards width:3 bar:Justin from:01/01/2003 till:11/21/2015 color:Lead bar:Justin from:01/01/2003 till:11/21/2015 color:Backing width:3 bar:Beau from:01/01/2003 till:11/21/2015 color:Rhythm bar:Beau from:11/21/2015 till:end color:Lead bar:Beau from:11/21/2015 till:end color:Rhythm width:7 bar:Beau from:01/01/2003 till:end color:Backing width:3 bar:Beau from:01/01/2003 till:06/17/2003 color:Keyboards width:7 bar:Beau from:07/21/2010 till:12/12/2012 color:Keyboards width:7 bar:Beau from:12/12/2012 till:05/17/2014 color:Keyboards width:7 bar:Zach from:01/01/2003 till:06/17/2003 color:Bass bar:Chris from:06/17/2003 till:end color:Bass bar:Chris from:06/17/2003 till:end color:Keyboards width:7 bar:Chris from:06/17/2003 till:end color:Backing width:3 bar:Alex from:06/17/2003 till:end color:Percussion width:3 bar:Alex from:06/17/2003 till:end color:Drums ==Discography== Studio albums * Saosin (2006) * In Search of Solid Ground (2009) * Along the Shadow (2016) ==ReferencesInterview of Saosin by PlayPro.com Category:Capitol Records artists Category:Epitaph Records artists Category:Virgin Records artists Category:Musical groups from Orange County, California Category:American post-hardcore musical groups Category:American emo musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:American screamo musical groups ","title":"Saosin"},{"id":"1438550","text":"A variant of apple mint, pineapple mint, displays white variegation on its leaves, Pierce County, Washington Mentha suaveolens, the apple mint, pineapple mint, woolly mint or round-leafed mint (synonyms M. rotundifolia, Mentha macrostachya, Mentha insularis), is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae. It is native to southern and western Europe including the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous, upright perennial plant that is most commonly grown as a culinary herb or for ground cover. ==Description== Apple mint typically grows to a height of from tall and spreads by stolons to form clonal colonies. The foliage is light green, with the opposite, wrinkled, sessile leaves being oblong to nearly ovate, long and broad. They are somewhat hairy on top and downy underneath with serrated edges. The flowers develop in terminal spikes long and consisting of a number of whorls of white or pinkish flowers. Apple mint flowers in mid to late summer. The plant is aromatic with a fruity, minty flavour. ==Distribution== Apple mint is native to southern and western Europe and is naturalised in central and northern parts of Europe. It is found in damp and wet locations. ==Cultivation and uses== An attractive herb, apple mint is often used as an ornamental plant. It is hardy and easy to grow, preferring full sun to lightly shady conditions. The leaves of this plant can be used to make apple mint jelly, as well as a flavoring in dishes such as apple mint couscous. It is also often used to make a mint tea, as a garnish, or in salads. Pineapple mint (Mentha suaveolens 'Variegata') is a cultivar of apple mint that has leaves which are banded with white. A hybrid derived from it is grapefruit mint (Mentha suaveolens × piperata).

Translated into English, Takasu means \\"hawk's nest\\". As of April 2020, the town has an estimated population of 6,780 people. == Geography == Takasu is located in the central area of Hokkaido, the most northern island in Japan. Takasu has an approximate land area of 139.44 km², and is located near Asahikawa, the second largest city in Hokkaido. Numerous rivers run through the town of Takasu, with the main one being the Osarappe River, which runs from north to south, and is approximately 25.7 km in length. Another major river is the Ishikari River which flows from Mt. Daisetsu, a volcanic peak in central Hokkaido. == Climate == From late November to mid-April, Takasu experiences a heavy snowfall, with depths reaching 1.3 metres. Mid-January to late February is the coldest period, with minimum temperatures reaching as low as -30 °C. Summer temperatures occasionally exceed 30 °C; however low humidity means that Takasu enjoys a mild and comfortable summer. Overall, Takasu experiences four distinct seasons; each possessing a unique characteristic. Winter brings a heavy blanket of powder snow; spring sees the bloom of cherry blossoms and sucklings sprout; summer provides a landscape filled with green, as harvest prospers; and the autumn brings the crisp red leaves of Japanese maple trees. == Industry == With an abundance of fertile land, Takasu has developed an agricultural sector centred on rice growing. Rice accounts for 80 per cent of Takasu's total agricultural product. In recent years, Takasu has been one of the eminent producers of Hokkaido Hoshi no Yume and Kirara 397 rice in terms of quality and harvest. The next biggest industry in Takasu is the production of vegetables, particularly tomatoes. Takasu is the centre of production for a range of Ookami no momo brand tomato products, such as tomato juice and puree. Takasu is also home to one of Honda's \\"Proving Grounds\\". Honda tests new products to see how they stand up to the harsh winter conditions found in central Hokkaido. The other Honda development facility is found in Tochigi Prefecture. Honda not only test cars at the Takasu Proving Grounds, but bikes and snowblowers. == Emblem and symbols == The Takasu town emblem was established on January 1, 1968, from ideas submitted by the local citizens. The town emblem incorporates four meaningful elements. Firstly, it is a modern representation of a hawk, the town's namesake, with wings spread in full flight. The oval in the centre symbolises a grain of rice, which is a major produce in Takasu. Finally, the single line making a circle symbolises the harmony and unity between the citizens, while the twist of the line represents the bright future of Takasu. Takasu has two other official town symbols – the marigold is the town flower, and mountain ash is the town tree. == Domestic exchange program == Takasu has a domestic school exchange program with Takashima Town in Nagasaki Prefecture. Since 1996 a delegation of ten students from each town visits the other, and stays with local families. The purpose of this domestic exchange program is to strengthen friendship and understanding between citizens in the two towns. == Sister city == Takasu currently has one sister city relationship with the Gold Coast, in Queensland, Australia. This relationship initially commenced in 1991, as a friendly relations agreement with the Albert Shire region of the Gold Coast. Upon the Albert Shire's amalgamation with the Gold Coast City, the relationship between Takasu and the Gold Coast was upgraded to an official Sister City Agreement in 1995. ==External links== * * Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ","title":"Takasu, Hokkaido"},{"id":"1438563","text":"Korg Triton rack-mountable sound module. A sound module is an electronic musical instrument without a human-playable interface such as a piano-style musical keyboard. Sound modules have to be operated using an externally connected device, which is often a MIDI controller, of which the most common type is the musical keyboard (although wind controllers, guitar controllers and electronic drum pads are also used). Controllers are devices that provide the human-playable interface and which may or may not produce sounds of their own. Another common way of controlling a sound module is through a sequencer, which is computer hardware or software designed to record and playback control information for sound-generating hardware (e.g., a DJ may program a bassline and use the sound module to produce the sound). Connections between sound modules, controllers, and sequencers are generally made with MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), which is a standardized protocol designed for this purpose, which includes special ports (jacks) and cables. Sound modules are often rack-mountable, but might also have a table-top form factor, particularly when the intended user is a DJ or record producer. The height of a sound module is often described in rack units (\\"U\\") or unit. Small sound modules are mostly 1U in height, the larger models a multiplication e.g. 2U or 3U. Despite their name, most sound modules do not produce any audible sound until their output is plugged into a keyboard amplifier or a PA system. There are a wide variety of sound modules, ranging from more generalist modules that can be used for a number of controllers or instruments (e.g., a rack mount synthesizer with hundreds of commonly used presets of instrument sounds, from piano and organ to synth brass and string pads) to specialized modules designed for use with wind controllers, electronic drum pads, digital accordions, or to produce clonewheel organ sounds. Hardware sound modules have largely been replaced by software synthesizers, due to the increased speed and processing power of computers and their decrease in price. Nevertheless, some DJs, EDM musicians and record producers continue to use vintage 1980s sound modules like the Yamaha TX16W (1988) for their unique, retro sound. ==Terminology== A sound module may also be referred to as \\"tone generator\\", \\"synth module\\", \\"MIDI sound generator\\", \\"MIDI module\\", \\"expander\\", or \\"rack- mount synthesizer\\". With electronic drums, the sound module is sometimes colloquially called the \\"brain\\". ==Technologies and types== A Studio Electronics Omega 2 rackmount module. Sound modules may use any number of technologies to produce their sounds. A sound module may be an analog or digital synthesizer, a sampler, or a rompler. Electronic drum modules are sound modules which specialize in drumkit and percussion sounds. Drum modules may be triggered by external trigger pads or pickups attached to an acoustic drum as well as through MIDI controller pads. Drum modules are distinguished from drum machines through their lack of dedicated onboard triggers and lack of an integrated sequencer. Clonewheel organ modules are usually tabletop- style devices that enable keyboardists to recreate the sound of a tonewheel- based Hammond organ using any MIDI keyboard or MIDI-equipped stage piano. Organ modules may have drawbars and controls for a simulated Leslie speaker (a rotating horn and low-end baffle) effect. Some sound modules focus on piano sounds, typically providing grand piano, electric piano, and a few other keyboard sounds, such as clavinet. Wind controller modules are specialized synth modules that are designed to work with wind controllers. They typically support legato wind-style playing and can respond to the unique controller inputs, which sense breath, biting on the mouthpiece, and pressing keys. Wind controller players may use a specialized wind controller module such as the Yamaha VL70-m module or its predecessors, the VL-1 or VL-7. As well, wind controller players may use general purpose rack synths such as the Yamaha Motif XS Rack, Roland Fantom X, or the Roland Integra-7 rackmount MIDI sound module; however, these general use synths require extra wind sounds or \\"patches\\" to work well with wind controllers. An accordion module, which is designed for use with a MIDI-equipped digital accordion, focuses on providing synthesized and/or sampled accordion sounds (and sounds for related bellows- pumped instruments, such as bandoneon and concertina). Like other specialized sound modules, accordion modules also have other sounds (piano, string orchestra, flute, etc). Moreso than for other sound modules, accordion modules are likely to also have music sequencer, drum machine, and backing track features, to enable a performer to do a one man band show. Accordion modules are manufactured by firms such as Ketron and Soltron. Synth modules often have onboard effects units, such as reverb and chorus effect, or, for organ modules, vibrato and overdrive. The Access Virus A module. Because most electronic instruments are designed in a modularized way, manufacturers often release a sound module version of their fully integrated instruments. For example, the 1980s-era DX-7 synthesizer/keyboard was also sold as a standalone \\"sound module\\", the TX-7. A sound module may have all the other features of the controller-equipped version, but it often has a smaller display or limited programming controls. In this case, instrument and other sounds can be loaded through MIDI or external media. In some cases, sound modules have expanded capacity for sounds in comparison to the controller-equipped version. ==User interface== Roland SH-32 The front of a rackmount sound module, or the top for tabletop units, typically contains a small screen or panel to provide information to the user (e.g., an electric piano sound may be called EP 1). This may be an LCD panel (which may or may not be backlit) or an LED alphanumeric display. This may be supplemented with LED indicators to show the status of various features. In some models, LED indicators are embedded within a translucent button, so pressing the button shows its status on the button. There is usually a volume control, some types of buttons or knobs for selecting sounds and changing settings, and a power button. The smallest, simplest piano modules may have only a volume knob and a knob to scroll through several piano sounds. The most complex synth modules may have a large number of knobs, buttons, and faders to control oscillators, filters, and amplitude settings. The rear panel usually contains 1/4 inch left and right audio outputs and one or more 5-pin MIDI inputs. Some units may have MIDI thru connections, which can be used to chain synth devices. In the 2010s and 2020s, some synth modules have one or two USB connections. Some synth modules may have left and right XLR outputs and one or more pedal inputs (for a sustain pedal and expression pedal). The front panel may also have a headphone jack, USB port, or another port for making connections. Some synth modules may have an XLR input for a vocal mic, for routing through a vocoder. Some 2010s and 2020s-era synth modules can be connected to a computer (laptop, tablet, etc), to allow the user to use editing software to make advanced changes to settings or sounds. Many synth modules can have new sounds loaded. In 1980s-era modules, external tape players, cartridges, or floppy disks were used. In the 2000s (decade) and 2010s, USB connections were increasingly used to load new sounds. Some 2020s-era sound modules have a WiFi antenna connection to allow wireless loading of updates and new sounds. ==Advantages== A Waldorf Micro Q module. A sound module has the same advantages over a fully integrated instrument as does any system with a modularized design: * Cost — a sound module is cheaper than a comparable instrument equipped with a controller. * Space and weight — a sound module takes up less room and weighs less than an instrument equipped with a controller, facilitating transportation and touring. * Portability - a performer going on tour can bring only her/his sound modules, so long as a MIDI controller is provided as \\"backline\\" gear (e.g., a MIDI keyboard). Many professional studios have a MIDI stage piano on hand. * Expandability — many sound modules can be expanded with sounds and memory. * Troubleshooting – if a sound module in a rack case develops problems, just this one unit can be removed for repair or replacement, leaving the rest of a keyboard player's rig the same (e.g., other rack-mounted sound modules, power amps, etc.). * Obsolescence cycles — when it becomes obsolete, a sound module can be replaced without changing a favorite controller, or vice versa. ==Notable examples== * Roland MKS20: Piano sound module used by many bands in the 1980s to early 1990s. Based on the synth \\"engine\\" from RD1000 digital piano (the full version with a keyboard). * Yamaha TX16W (1988): sound module with an ability to boot its operating system (OS) from diskette; known particularly well for having a third-party OS codenamed Typhoon 2000 by NuEdge Development, a group of hackers who were dissatisfied with the original OS. * Roland Sound Canvas series (1991): first sound module to implement General MIDI standard with Roland GS extensions. ==Difference from audio interfaces== Audio interfaces are often erroneously called sound modules. The audio interface connects a computer to other devices; and software in the computer actually generates sound using samples or synthesis. The functionality of the computer and I/O device plus the software is a superset of a traditional sound module. ==See also== * Modular synthesizer * Software synthesizer * Sound card * Synthesizer ==References== * Category:Synthesizers ","title":"Sound module"},{"id":"1438564","text":"Clonskeagh Green Clonskeagh or Clonskea (, meaning \\"meadow of the Whitethorn\\"; pronounced ), is a small southern suburb of Dublin, Ireland. The district straddles the River Dodder. ==Location and access== Clonskeagh is a townland in the civil parish of Donnybrook in the traditional barony of Dublin. The modern suburb lies partially within the administrative area of Dublin City Council but mostly in that of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown. Roebuck Road defines the southernmost end of Clonskeagh; this area is sometimes known as Roebuck and occasionally considered to be part of Windy Arbour. The area is principally defined by the Clonskeagh Road and its extension into Roebuck Road, which spans its length. The northern end of the Clonskeagh Road at the junction with Eglinton Road / Milltown Road separates it from Ranelagh to the north, and the campus of University College Dublin at Belfield is to the east while Goatstown and Dundrum lie to the south. To the west is Windy Arbour, but there is no clear point at which that boundary might be defined. ==Character and development== Clonskeagh is primarily a residential area, developed in the early decades of the 20th century. It has a small village green with a few local shops. The district has changed in character as population growth in greater Dublin has imposed increasingly intensive use of land and the nearby Luas light railway has improved commuter access to central Dublin. In the mid-1970s, Clonskeagh consisted of low-density housing with significant areas of private open land, largely owned by the Catholic Church. Since then, the closure of the Masonic Boys' School has led to commercial redevelopment north of Clonskeagh Road and former church land adjacent to Bird Avenue and Roebuck Road now has housing. Since 2000, housing development has intensified land use further by building in larger gardens, replacing houses by apartments and adding storeys to properties. This may be resisted by residents objecting to planning applications. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which was established in 1992, is also based in Clonskeagh. ==Amenities== The Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh There is a mid-20th century Catholic church on Bird Avenue, and the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland and its associated primary school is on Roebuck Road. The former Vergemount Fever Hospital at Clonskeagh is now a nursing home facility for the elderly. There are also several green spaces, as well as a large health and fitness club, and fishing takes place on the Dodder. ==Education== St. Kilians Deutsche Schule and the secondary campus of the Lycée Français d'IrlandeLycée Français d'Irlande Homepage share a \\"Eurocampus\\" in Roebuck Road, offering private schooling in a multicultural and multilingual environment, claimed to be unique to Ireland. ==Sport== The first-ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final was held in Beech Hill, Clonskeagh, one of the features of the area, on April 29, 1888, on the ground of St. Benburb's Football Club. ==People== Roebuck House, Clonskeagh (note infill development behind old house) *Isaac Butt Q.C.

However, because zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection. These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter. The condition may affect the gastrointestinal tract or the skin. In non-trauma cases, it usually begins in the nose and paranasal sinuses and is one of the most rapidly spreading fungal infections in humans. Common symptoms include thrombosis and tissue necrosis. Treatment consists of prompt and intensive antifungal drug therapy and surgery to remove the infected tissue. The prognosis varies vastly depending upon an individual patient's circumstances. ==Causes== Micrograph showing a zygomycetes infection. Pathogenic zygomycosis is caused by species in two orders: Mucorales or Entomophthorales, with the former causing far more disease than the latter. These diseases are known as \\"mucormycosis\\" and \\"entomophthoramycosis\\", respectively. * Order Mucorales (mucormycosis) ** Family Mucoraceae *** Absidia (Absidia corymbifera) *** Apophysomyces (Apophysomyces elegans and Apophysomyces trapeziformis) *** Mucor (Mucor indicus) *** Rhizomucor (Rhizomucor pusillus) *** Rhizopus (Rhizopus oryzae) ** Family Cunninghamellaceae *** Cunninghamella (Cunninghamella bertholletiae) ** Family Thamnidiaceae *** Cokeromyces (Cokeromyces recurvatus) ** Family Saksenaeaceae *** Saksenaea (Saksenaea vasiformis) ** Family Syncephalastraceae *** Syncephalastrum (Syncephalastrum racemosum) * Order Entomophthorales (entomophthoramycosis) ** Family Basidiobolaceae *** Basidiobolus (Basidiobolus ranarum) ** Family Ancylistaceae *** Conidiobolus (Conidiobolus coronatus/Conidiobolus incongruus) ==Epidemiology== Zygomycosis has been found in survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and in survivors of the 2011 Joplin, Missouri tornado. ==Other animals== The term oomycosis is used to describe oomycete infections. These are more common in animals, notably dogs and horses. These are heterokonts, not true fungi. Types include pythiosis (caused by Pythium insidiosum) and lagenidiosis. Zygomycosis has been described in a cat, where fungal infection of the tracheobronchus led to respiratory disease requiring euthanasia. ==References== == External links == Category:Animal fungal diseases Category:Dog diseases Category:Horse diseases Category:Mycosis-related cutaneous conditions Category:Parasitic fungi Category:Sheep and goat diseases ","title":"Zygomycosis"},{"id":"1438573","text":"is a town located in Kamikawa Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

Among these are a campground, large children's obstacle course, tennis courts, soccer, baseball and softball fields, park golf course, ski slope (beginner level with 1 rope lift only) and sports center. In addition, the town is also home to the Papillion Chateau insect museum, the Tōma Shōnyūdō Limestone Cave (one of the few in Hokkaido), and Healthy Chateau, a medium-sized hot spring. ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ","title":"Tōma, Hokkaido"},{"id":"1438575","text":"The so-called Drake's Plate of Brass is a forgery that purports to be the brass plaque that Francis Drake posted upon landing in Northern California in 1579. The hoax was successful for 40 years, despite early doubts. After the plate came to public attention in 1936, historians raised questions regarding the plate's wording, spelling and manufacture. The hoax's perpetrators attempted to apprise the plate's finders as to its origins. Many presumed the plate to be authentic after an early metallurgical study concluded it was genuine. In the late 1970s, scientists determined that the plate was a modern creation after it failed a battery of physical and chemical tests. Much of the mystery surrounding the plate continued until 2003, when historians advanced a theory about who created the plate and why, showing the plate to be a practical joke by local historians gone awry. The plate was acquired by – and is often on display at – the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley. The so-called Drake's Plate of Brass. Note the hole in the lower right. The real plate was described as displaying the queen's portrait on a sixpence coin through a hole in the plate. ==The historical plate== Sir Francis Drake, by Nicholas Hilliard, 1581 Drake landed somewhere north in Alta California in 1579. According to a contemporary account by Francis Pretty, a member of Drake's party, Drake left behind \\"a plate of brasse\\" as \\"a monument of our being there\\" that claimed \\"her maiesties, and successors right and title to that kingdome\\". The memoirs also say that the plate included the date of the landing, Drake's name, and the queen's portrait on a sixpence coin, showing through a hole in the plate. Pretty's detailed description of the plate became the recipe for the prank that became the Drake Plate hoax. ==The found plate: description and text== The plate that came to light in the 1930s matched the description in the historical record in many ways. It was made of brass, with lettering that appeared to have been chiseled into its face. There was the hole for a sixpence coin, and the text contained all the content that Pretty described: :BEE IT KNOWNE VNTO ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS. :IVNE.17.1579 :BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND IN THE NAME OF HERR :MAIESTYQVEEN ELIZABETH OF ENGLAND AND HERR :SVCCESSORS FOREVER, I TAKE POSSESSION OF THIS :KINGDOME WHOSE KING AND PEOPLE FREELY RESIGNE :THEIR RIGHT AND TITLE IN THE WHOLE LAND VNTO HERR :MAIESTIEES KEEPEING. NOW NAMED BY ME AN TO BEE :KNOWNE V(N) TO ALL MEN AS NOVA ALBION. :G. FRANCIS DRAKE :(Hole for sixpence) ==Origins: a practical joke gone awry== The origins of the found plate have been a matter of debate and rumor for much of its history. Historians have recently painted a clear picture of the beginning of the hoax. Working for ten years, a team of four researchers pieced together a complete narrative of the out-of-hand joke. The four—Edward Von der Porten, Raymond Aker, Robert W. Allen, and James M. Spitze—published their account in California History in 2002.Edward Von der Porten, Raymond Aker, Robert W. Allen, James M. Spitze. \\"Who Made Drake's Plate of Brass? Hint: It Wasn't Francis Drake\\" California History, Vol. 81, No. 2 (2002), pp. 116–133 ===Creation=== According to this account, the plate was intended to be a joke among members of a playful fraternity of California history enthusiasts, the Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus (\\"ECV\\"). George Ezra Dane, an ECV leader, initiated the hoax as a joke intended for fellow \\"Clamper\\" Herbert Bolton to find. The plate was likely made by George Clark in his workshop. Wheat was the leading figure in reviving ECV as a fraternity of historians and Western lore enthusiasts. ECV describes itself as \\"dedicated to the erection of historical plaques, the protection of widows and orphans, especially the widows, and having a grand time while accomplishing these purposes.\\"Quoted in Von der Porten 2002 Pranks at fellow Clampers' expense were a regular part of the group's activities. The target of the hoax, Herbert Eugene Bolton, had a special interest in the plate. Bolton was a distinguished professor of California history and director of the Bancroft Library at the University of California. Over his career, he exhorted students to look for the plate—and to contact him if they ever heard of an artifact matching the historical description. According to the 2002 account, Dane initiated the plot. Barron, a former curator of American history at the De Young Museum in San Francisco, designed the plate and bought the brass at a nearby shipyard, where a worker cut the plate from modern brass with a modern guillotine shear. George Clark, an inventor and art critic and appraiser, hammered the letters into the plate with a simple cold chisel. Clark told his wife that the \\"C.G.\\"—later taken to stand for \\"Captain General\\"—before Drake's name was essentially his own signature. As a final mark of the gag, Lorenz Noll (1891–1962) and Albert Dressler (1887–1960) painted \\"ECV\\" on the back of the plate in paint visible under ultraviolet light. ===Discovery and loss=== Von der Porten, Aker, and Allen surmise that the conspirators probably planted the plate in Marin in 1933, not far from the supposed location of Drake's landing. William Caldeira, a chauffeur, found the plate while his employer, Leon Bocqueraz, was hunting near the shores of Drake's Bay with a companion, Anson Stiles Blake. Bocqueraz was a banker, while Blake was a prominent and active Berkeley alumnus. Both were members of the California Historical Society. Caldeira showed the dirt-covered plate to Bocqueraz, then stowed the plate in the car to investigate later and then forgot about it. Some weeks later, he found it while cleaning the car on the San Rafael Ferry and threw it away on the side of the road in San Rafael—several miles from its original location, but still in the Marin area. This was the first of a series of events that ultimately spun the joke out of the conspirators' control. ===Re- discovery and publicity=== The plate was found again, three years later, in 1936, by Beryle Shinn, a shop clerk. Von der Porten, Spitze, Aker and Allen state that \\"the low membership and limited activity of E Clampus Vitus at that time (1933) makes this scenario (the finding of the Caldeira plate) so unlikely that the present authors do not consider it credible.\\" They conclude that Caldeira had not found the Clamper's hoax plate. Shinn showed it to a friend, a Berkeley student, who suggested that he take the plate to Bolton. In February 1937, Shinn brought it to Bolton, which to Bolton was fulfillment of a decades-old professional dream. Bolton compared it to Francis Pretty'sThe attribution of the World Encompassed to Pretty comes from an early French printing which erroneously assigned Pretty's name. The actual significant source is Chaplain Francis Fletcher. contemporaneous description of the plate. He alerted Robert Gordon Sproul, the University of California president, and Allen L. Chickering, the president of the California Historical Society, to the possibility of a major find. Chickering and Bolton negotiated to buy the plate, offering to pay $2,500 () and to assume all risk regarding the authenticity of the plate. Then another series of events took the hoax to the next level. One day after agreeing in principle to sell the plate, Shinn took it back from Bolton, saying he wanted to show it to his uncle and then return it. Bolton and Chickering did not hear from Shinn again for four days. Apparently frightened that they might lose this major opportunity, Chickering moved to quickly buy the plate for $3,500 (). The plate was then given to the University's Bancroft Library. Bolton soon announced at a California Historical Society meeting, on April 6, 1937, \\"One of the world's long-lost historical treasures apparently has been found!... The authenticity of the tablet seems to me beyond all reasonable doubt.\\" Now, having only minimally investigated the plate, Bolton and Chickering had publicly committed themselves, personally and professionally, and their institutions to the authenticity of the plate. ===Early doubts=== Skeptics pointed out many suspicious elements of the plate. Reginald B. Haselden, a specialist in Elizabethan literature, published a critique of the plate in the September 1937 issue of California History, outlining a list of problems. The spelling seemed modern. The wording did not match normal Elizabethan forms. For example, the plate reads \\"Queen Elizabeth\\", not the standard style \\"Elizabeth, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith\\". The plate contains the modern forms \\"the\\" and \\"this\\" instead of the 16th century \\"ye\\" and \\"y(i)s\\". Physically, the plate seemed too uniform and the patina suspect. Yet none of these elements by themselves seemed to determine the matter, alternative interpretations of each being available. Haselden's points were immediately disputed. Chickering published a defense of the plate in the same issue of California Monthly. ===The conspirators' warnings=== The joke, originally intended as an internal Clamper affair, had quickly and suddenly broken out into the public eye. Rather than unveiling their prank at an ECV dinner among friends, revealing the hoax would now be a very public and painful proposition for all involved. As Von der Porten and others wrote, \\"Private confession could not be kept private, and public confession was fraught with great peril.\\" The conspirators found a number of ways of trying to tip off Bolton without coming forward. V. L. Vander Hoof, a fellow Clamper and Berkeley professor, made a spoof of the plate a few weeks after the announcement of the find, hoping to show Bolton that modern tools could make a plate that looked remarkably like the \\"real\\" plate. Clamper Edwin Grabhorn, a Western history publisher, published a spoof letter from the \\"Consolidated Brasse and Novelty Company\\" offering a \\"special line of brass plates\\" guaranteed to \\"make your home-town famous.\\" Finally, ECV produced a small press run of a book, Ye Preposterous Booke of Brasse, detailing problems with the metal content, wording and spelling. The book even instructed the reader to look for the \\"ECV\\" in fluorescent paint on the back and stated outright \\"we should now re-claim [the plate] as the rightful property of our ancient Order\\", meaning ECV. ===\\"Confirmation\\"=== While Bolton and Chickering continued to defend the plate, doubts and rumors continued to circulate. Sproul, the University president, had become concerned as well. Bolton choose Professor Colin Fink, chair of the Division of Electrochemistry of Columbia University, to authenticate the plate. While the California history community, and certainly Bolton, would have been aware of the Clampers' book of clues, Fink may not have been. In any case, in 1938 Fink and his colleague E. P. Polushkin confirmed the plate as genuine in no uncertain terms: \\"[I]t is our opinion that the brass plate examined by us is the genuine Drake Plate.\\"Quoted in Von der Porten 2002 For most observers, including Bolton and Chickering, this was the definitive statement on the plate's origins. Photos of the plate appeared in textbooks. Copies were sold as souvenirs, and a copy was also displayed in the library of Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo (the only high school named after the explorer). On several ceremonial occasions, copies of the plate were presented to Queen Elizabeth II. Yet rumors of E Clampus Vitus involvement in the plate continued to circulate. ==Scientific investigation== In the early 1970s, physics caught up to Haselden's original findings. Professor James D. Hart, director of the Bancroft Library, assembled a re-testing plan in preparation for the 400th anniversary of Drake's landing. He asked the Research Laboratory for Archaeology, the History of Art at Oxford University, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for a detailed analysis. The tests included x-ray diffraction, stereo microscopy, and additional metallurgical analysis. X-ray diffraction and gamma-ray absorption tests revealed the plate to be too smooth, made by modern rolling equipment, not hammered flat by a sixteenth-century hammer. Dr. Frank Asaro, at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, working with colleague Helen Michels, used neutron activation analysis to study the plate and found that it contained far too much zinc and too few impurities to be Elizabethan English brass, while containing trace metals that corresponded to modern American brass.\\"Chemical Study of the Plate of Brass\\", H.V. Michel and F. Asaro, Archaeometry 21 No. 1, 1979 Cyril Stanley Smith of MIT examined the plate under a stereo microscope and found the edges to be consistent with modern cutting equipment. ==See also== * His Majesty, McDuck – a 1989 Walt Disney story fashioned after the plate discovery * New Albion * Drake Navigators Guild ==References== ==External links== * Plateofbrass.com: The Mystery of the Plate of Brass: California's Greatest Hoax and The Search for its Perpetrators * Edward Von der Porten, Raymond Aker, Robert W.

The Tariff of 1857 was developed in response to a federal budget surplus in the mid-1850s. The first version was authored by Representative Lewis D. Campbell and contained provisions only for an increased number of goods that could be imported without duties being leveed. After protests primarily from agricultural interests, Senator Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter introduced a new version of the bill, which in addition to removing duties from some imports decreased all tariffs by between 20% and 25%. The bill was signed into law on 3 March 1857. Support for the bill did not come from any political or geographic bloc as a whole, but was driven primarily by local economic interests--for example, Northeastern wool processors supported the bill, as they had been suffering under high duties on their goods, while Northern manufacturers advocated high protectionist tariffs. Southern agricultural interests generally supported the lower tariffs, as they had long felt that tariffs advocated by Northern industry led to unfairly high by high costs of the goods farmers consumed. According to historian Kenneth M. Stampp, the bill \\"was possible because it did not represent a victory of one section over the other; nor did it produce a clear division between parties. Its supporters included Democrats, Republicans, and Americans; representatives of northern merchants, manufacturers, and railroad interests; and spokesmen for southern farmers and planters. Opposition came largely from two economic groups: the iron manufacturers of Pennsylvania and the wool growers of New England and the West.\\" When the Panic of 1857 struck later that year, protectionists, led by economist Henry C. Carey, blamed the downturn on the new tariff. The Tariff of 1857's cuts lasted only a few years, as the highly protectionist Morrill Tariff was signed into law in March 1861. ==References== 1857 Category:United States federal taxation legislation Category:1857 in the United States ","title":"Tariff of 1857"},{"id":"1438593","text":"The area of Kamikawa (Ishikari) District in Kamikawa Subprefecture. is a district located in Kamikawa Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

The lake was formerly surrounded by summer vacation cottages and camps, but most of these buildings have now been converted for use as year-round homes. Silver Lake State Park occupies the northern end of the lakeshore. The lake is located on NH Route 122, north of the Hollis traffic light. The lake at its deepest is deep, and there is a deep channel running down the middle of the lake that ranges from at the deepest. Fish species include largemouth bass, yellow perch, sunfish, pickerel, hornpout/catfish, and a few very large common carp. The lake's depth and continual supply of cold, clean water from below can support both rainbow and brown trout. The lake has many natural springs that provide fresh, clean water, and the small dam at the north end of the lake near the state park controls the level and output. The output flows under NH 122 and goes into Dunklee Pond which then outflows to Pennichuck Brook, a tributary of the Merrimack River. The lake has no public boat launch, although parking at the state park can allow carry-in boats, sailboats, kayaks and other small boats. The lake has restricted hours that allow for boats to go above , but has no horsepower limit. The lake has been tested for acceptable bacteria levels, and as of 2006 the State of New Hampshire had deemed the lake acceptable for swimming. In the early 1900s when the lake was called Long Pond, it housed two dance halls, Wallace Grove and Morrills Grove. These dance halls were a very popular retreat on summer nights for many locals, some coming from as far away as Boston. Soldiers would take the train up from Fort Devens with the hope of meeting a special lady. Although both halls are long-closed, the lake remains a summer and winter retreat. ==See also== *List of lakes in New Hampshire ==References== == External links == * Silver Lake State Park, NH Division of Parks and Recreation Category:Lakes of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire ","title":"Silver Lake (Hollis, New Hampshire)"},{"id":"1438612","text":"Blackmail is the act of threatening to reveal potentially incriminating information about a person or group unless a specific demand is met.

It usually includes one or more specific items of business to be acted upon. It may, but is not required to, include specific times for one or more activities. An agenda may also be called a docket, schedule, or calendar. It may also contain a listing of an order of business. == Etymology == Agenda is an abbreviation of agenda sunt or agendum est, gerundive forms in plural and singular respectively of the Latin verb ago, agere, egi, actum \\"to drive on, set in motion\\", for example of cattle.Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. nMarchant & Charles The meaning is \\"(those things/that thing) which must be driven forward\\". What is now known in English as an agenda is a list of individual items which must be \\"acted upon\\" or processed, usually those matters which must be discussed at a business meeting. Although the Latin word is in a plural form, as a borrowed word in English, the word is singular and has a plural of \\"agendas\\".See dictionary definitions of \\"agenda\\" at Oxford Dictionaries and thefreedictionary.com (\\"Usage Note: The term agendum has largely been supplanted by its Latin plural agenda, which is treated as a singular noun and denotes a list or program of numerous things, as in The agenda for the meeting has not yet been set. In this use, the plural of agenda is agendas.\\"). == Explanation == An agenda lists the items of business to be taken up during a meeting or session. It may also be called a \\"calendar\\". A meeting agenda may be headed with the date, time and location of the meeting, followed by a series of points outlining the order in which the business is to be conducted. Steps on any agenda can include any type of schedule or order the group wants to follow. Agendas may take different forms depending on the specific purpose of the group and may include any number of the items. In business meetings of a deliberative assembly, the items on the agenda are also known as the orders of the day. Optimally, the agenda is distributed to a meeting's participants prior to the meeting, so that they will be aware of the subjects to be discussed, and are able to prepare for the meeting accordingly. In a workshop, the sequence of agenda items is important, as later agenda steps may be dependent upon information derived from or completion of earlier steps in the agenda. Frequently in standard meetings, agenda items may be \\"time boxed\\" or fixed so as not to exceed a predetermined amount of time. In workshops, time boxing may not be effective because completion of each agenda step may be critical to beginning the next step. In parliamentary procedure, an agenda is not binding upon an assembly unless its own rules make it so, or unless it has been adopted as the agenda for the meeting by majority vote at the start of the meeting. Otherwise, it is merely for the guidance of the chair. If an agenda is binding upon an assembly, and a specific time is listed for an item, that item cannot be taken up before that time, and must be taken up when that time arrives even if other business is pending. If it is desired to do otherwise, the rules can be suspended for that purpose. == Order of business == In parliamentary procedure, an order of business, as the name may suggest, is the sequence of items that is to be taken up during a meeting. This sequence may be a standard order of business or a sequence listed on an agenda that the assembly has agreed to follow. === Standard Order of Business === Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR) has the following standard order of business: # Reading and approval of minutes # Reports of officers, boards and standing committees # Reports of special committees # Special orders # Unfinished business and general orders # New business The above standard order of business has been found to be appropriate for meetings in most organizations. The \\"special orders\\" and \\"general orders\\" refer to items of business that usually come from a previous meeting (the word \\"order\\" in these two cases do not refer to \\"sequence\\" but instead is more like a \\"command\\" in its meaning). Usually items become special orders or general orders by adoption of the motion to postpone. A difference between these orders is that, in general, a special order can interrupt other business when the time comes for its consideration, while a general order waits until the pending business is taken care of. For example, say a motion is being considered and then postponed to the next meeting. This postponed motion becomes a general order for the next meeting. When the time for \\"general orders\\" comes up in the order of business, consideration of the postponed motion is resumed. \\"New business\\" is where the bulk of the discussion as well as decisions in the meeting usually takes place. If a group has not adopted an agenda or an order of business, all of its business would be considered \\"new business\\". === Optional headings === Organizations may have the following optional headings in their order of business: * Opening ceremonies - Items may include invocation, singing of the national anthem, reciting of the pledge of allegiance, reading of the mission of the organization, recognition of dignitaries, etc. * Roll call (taking of attendance) * Review and adoption of the agenda * Consent calendar - tool used by deliberative assemblies with a heavy workload to consider a series of items in bulk with a single vote * Good of the order, General Good and Welfare, or Open Forum - for other issues to allow a participant to raise another point for discussion * Announcements - may include review of key points, discussion of assignments, communications plan for what to tell others not in the meeting, and confirmation of the next meeting, if any * Program (such as an educational talk, film, or guest speaker) An agenda may list any of the above items. == Call for the orders of the day == A call for the orders of the day, in parliamentary procedure, is a motion to require a deliberative assembly to conform to its agenda or order of business. In Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), the \\"call\\" may be made by one member, and does not require a second. The chair must then proceed to the scheduled item of business, unless the assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds vote. The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure does not have this motion and instead suggests that a member can request that the body take up the scheduled item of business, or make a more formal point of order. In historical writing, the expression \\"order of the day\\", as in \\"abolition meetings became the order of the day\\", refers to an activity that was widespread, replacing other activities, at a particular moment in history. == See also == * Minutes == References == Category:Parliamentary procedure Category:Meetings Category:Latin gerundives in English ","title":"Agenda (meeting)"},{"id":"1438621","text":"is a town located in Kamikawa Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

It is located on the waterfront and offers views of the Tathong Channel. Heng Fa Chuen is administratively part of the Eastern District. ==History== The area which is now known as Heng Fa Chuen was reclaimed from Pak Sha Wan () and Lei Yue Mun Bay (). In fact, the place where the current Promenade along the shoreline is was once a beach. There was nothing in addition except for barren hills and numerous vegetation. Further to the West, near the current Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence, there was once a quarry. However, after consuming all of the quarry's resources, the miners dispersed, with some moving to Chai Wan and settling in wooden houses. The rest of the quarry was abolished by the Hong Kong Government, and there were still traces of it left before the establishment of the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defense. In the early 1980s, the Island Line of the MTR was built, the working name of the station was \\"Chai Wan Quay\\" on the Freeman, Fox, Wilbur Smith & Associates Mass Transportation Study became Heng Fa Chuen when the MTR became the rightful developer of the land on top of the station and depot. Not only was the name of the station changed, but also it was relocated to its present place (The old location is currently situated near the Chai Wan pier/Ming Pao Industrial Centre). Reclamation of the 15-hectare site began in 1978. To increase the development potential, the airport height limit on the site was raised from 30.48 metres above principal datum to 60 metres on 7 September 1984. The main architect of the development was Simon Kwan and Associates, while the main contractor was Carson Construction. Heng Fa Chuen was jointly developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the Heng Fa Chuen Development Company Limited. The latter was a consortium comprising Kerry Trading, Kiu Kwong Investment Corporation (associated with the Bank of China), and Riverkent Limited. All of the residential blocks are managed by MTR Property Management. The first 448 flats went on sale and were all sold on the evening of 25 July 1985. By 1986, the first 17 blocks of Heng Fa Chuen (all directly above the railway depot) were being completed and handed over to the owners. The remaining 31 blocks, which sit at grade closer to Victoria Harbour, were completed a few years later. ==Features== Heng Fa Chuen Residential Podium Paradise Mall Shopping Arcade before the 2018 renovation, with the theme of European Renaissance shown in the fountain and surrounding decorations.

The comparatively low height of the towers was due to their location in the flight path of most planes using the former Hong Kong International Airport at Kai Tak. ===Commerce=== The Paradise Mall shopping centre opened in 1987. It underwent a total renovation in early 2018, changing its theme, especially on the ground floor, from the European Renaissance style to a more sports-oriented style. Together with the renovation, the \\"Paradise Mall\\" also positioned itself as an outlet with well- known sports brands, including Adidas, Converse, NIKKO, Puma, and Under Armour, attracting people from outside Heng Fa Chuen. The world's 11,000th McDonald's fast-food restaurant was opened at Heng Fa Chuen in 1989. In 2000, a PARKnSHOP supermarket replaced the existing Carrefour giant chain supermarket.

Oberscharführer was first used as a rank of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and was created due to an expansion of the enlisted positions required by growing SA membership in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The SA rank of Oberscharführer was senior to Scharführer and junior to the rank of Truppführer. Since early ranks of the Schutzstaffel (SS) were identical to the ranks of SA, Oberscharführer was created as an SS rank at the same time the position was created within the SA. Initially, the rank of SS-Oberscharführer was equal to its SA counterpart; however, this changed in 1934 following the Night of the Long Knives. At that time, the SS rank system was reorganized and several new ranks established with older SA titles discontinued. The rank of SS- Oberscharführer was therefore \\"bumped up\\" and became equal to an SA- Truppführer. The insignia for the SS rank was changed, as well, becoming two silver collar pips in contrast to the SA insignia for Oberscharführer which was a single collar pip with silver stripe. Within the SA, an Oberscharführer was typically a squad leader, answering to a platoon non-commissioned officer. The responsibilities varied across a wider range in the SS, in particular between an Oberscharführer in the Allgemeine SS (general SS) and one holding the same position in the Waffen-SS (armed SS). After 1938, when the SS adopted field grey uniforms as the standard duty attire, SS-Oberscharführer displayed the shoulder insignia of a Wehrmacht Feldwebel. The rank of SS-Oberscharführer was junior to SS-Hauptscharführer. ==Insignia== SS-Oberscharführer h.svgShoulder strap SS-Oberscharführer (SS-Standartenjunker) NSFK-Oberscharführer.svgNSFK Gorget patches NSKK- Oberscharführer.svgNSKK Gorget patch SA-Oberscharführer.svgSA Gorget patch SS-Oberscharführer.svgSS Gorget patches HJ-Oberscharführer.svgHJ shoulder strap Fw Oscha OR6 cam slv 1945.svgSS smock insignia { class=\\"toccolours\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\\" - align=\\"center\\" width=\\"30%\\" Junior rank Scharführer !width=\\"40%\\" SS rank Oberscharführer width=\\"30%\\" Senior rank Hauptscharführer - align=\\"center\\" width=\\"30%\\" Junior rank Scharführer !width=\\"40%\\" SA rank Oberscharführer width=\\"30%\\" Senior rank Truppführer } ==See also== * Table of ranks and insignia of the Waffen-SS ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * Category:SS ranks ","title":"Oberscharführer"},{"id":"1438651","text":"In finance, a long position in a financial instrument means the holder of the position owns a positive amount of the instrument. The holder of the position has the expectation that the financial instrument will increase in value. This is known as a bullish position. == Security == In terms of a security, such as a stock or a bond, or equivalently to be long in a security, means the holder of the position owns the security, on the expectation that the security will increase in value, and will profit if the price of the security goes up. Going long a security is the more conventional practice of investing. == Future == Going long in a future means the holder of the position is obliged to buy the underlying instrument at the contract price at expiry. The holder of the position will profit if the price of the underlying instrument goes up, as the price he will pay will be less than the market price. == Option == An options investor goes long in an underlying investment (in technical jargon, the preposition \\"in\\" is omitted) by buying call options or selling put options on it. This is different from going long by buying the underlying or trading in futures, because a long position in an option does not necessarily mean that the holder will profit if the price of the underlying instrument goes up. Going long in an option gives the right (but not obligation) for the holder to exercise it. If the price rises to above the strike price, the owner of a call option will probably exercise the option to buy the instrument and (at least on paper) will gain if the difference between the price at that time and the strike price is greater than the premium which he paid. With a put option on the other hand, the seller of the option will profit (on paper) if the price of the instrument goes up (so that the option is not exercised by the buyer), or falls by less than what he received as a premium. ==See also== * Short (finance) * Position (finance) == References == Category:Financial markets Category:Securities (finance) Category:Stock market terminology ","title":"Long (finance)"},{"id":"1438653","text":"Illustration of a Jim crow from A Textbook on Civil Engineering — International Correspondence Schools published in 1899 by the Colliery Engineer Company.

The equation is a result of combining ideas of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics and is used to explain the spectral classification of stars. The expression was developed by Indian physicist Meghnad Saha in 1920. ==Derivation== For a gas at a high enough temperature (here measured in energy units, i.e. keV or J) and or density, the thermal collisions of the atoms will ionize some of the atoms, making an ionized gas. When several or more of the electrons that are normally bound to the atom in orbits around the atomic nucleus are freed, they form an independent electron gas cloud co-existing with the surrounding gas of atomic ions and neutral atoms. In turn, this generates an electric field, where the motion of charges generates currents, making a localised magnetic field, and creates the state of matter called plasma. The Saha equation describes the degree of ionization for any gas in thermal equilibrium as a function of the temperature, density, and ionization energies of the atoms. The Saha equation only holds for weakly ionized plasmas for which the Debye length is large. This means that the screening of the Coulomb interaction of ions and electrons by other ions and electrons is negligible. The subsequent lowering of the ionization potentials and the \\"cutoff\\" of the partition function is therefore also negligible. For a gas composed of a single atomic species, the Saha equation is written: :\\\\frac{n_{i+1}n_e}{n_i} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\lambda^{3}}\\\\frac{g_{i+1}}{g_i}\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{(\\\\epsilon_{i+1}-\\\\epsilon_i)}{k_B T}\\\\right] where: * n_i is the density of atoms in the i-th state of ionization, that is with i electrons removed. * g_i is the degeneracy of states for the i-ions * \\\\epsilon_i is the energy required to remove i electrons from a neutral atom, creating an i-level ion. * n_e is the electron density * \\\\lambda is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of an electron ::\\\\lambda \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{h^2}{2\\\\pi m_e k_B T}} * m_e is the mass of an electron * T is the temperature of the gas * h is Planck's constant The expression (\\\\epsilon_{i+1}-\\\\epsilon_i) is the energy required to remove the (i+1)^{th} electron. In the case where only one level of ionization is important, we have n_1=n_e and defining the total density n as n=n_0+n_1, the Saha equation simplifies to: :\\\\frac{n_e^2}{n-n_e} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\lambda^3}\\\\frac{g_1}{g_0}\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{-\\\\epsilon}{k_B T}\\\\right] where \\\\epsilon is the energy of ionization. ==Particle densities== The Saha equation is useful for determining the ratio of particle densities for two different ionization levels. The most useful form of the Saha equation for this purpose is :\\\\frac{Z_i}{N_i} = \\\\frac{Z_{i+1}Z_e}{N_{i+1}N_e}, where Z denotes the partition function. The Saha equation can be seen as a restatement of the equilibrium condition for the chemical potentials: :\\\\mu_i = \\\\mu_{i+1} + \\\\mu_e\\\\, This equation simply states that the potential for an atom of ionization state i to ionize is the same as the potential for an electron and an atom of ionization state i+1; the potentials are equal, therefore the system is in equilibrium and no net change of ionization will occur. ==Stellar atmospheres== In the early twenties Ralph H. Fowler (in collaboration with Charles Galton Darwin) developed a new method in statistical mechanics permitting a systematic calculation of the equilibrium properties of matter. He used this to provide a rigorous derivation of the ionization formula which Saha had obtained, by extending to the ionization of atoms the theorem of Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, used in physical chemistry for its application to molecular dissociation. Also, a significant improvement in the Saha equation introduced by Fowler was to include the effect of the excited states of atoms and ions. A further important step forward came in 1923, when Edward Arthur Milne and R.H. Fowler published a paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, showing that the criterion of the maximum intensity of absorption lines (belonging to subordinate series of a neutral atom) was much more fruitful in giving information about physical parameters of stellar atmospheres than the criterion employed by Saha which consisted in the marginal appearance or disappearance of absorption lines. The latter criterion requires some knowledge of the relevant pressures in the stellar atmospheres, and Saha following the generally accepted view at the time assumed a value of the order of 1 to 0.1 atmosphere. Milne wrote: > Saha had concentrated on the marginal appearances and disappearances of > absorption lines in the stellar sequence, assuming an order of magnitude for > the pressure in a stellar atmosphere and calculating the temperature where > increasing ionization, for example, inhibited further absorption of the line > in question owing to the loss of the series electron.

Here the equilibrium ionization states must be estimated by detailed statistical calculation of collision and recombination rates. ==The early universe== Equilibrium ionization, described by the Saha equation, explains evolution in the early universe. After the Big Bang, all atoms were ionized, leaving mostly protons and electrons. According to Saha's approach, when the universe had expanded and cooled such that the temperature reached about 3,000 K, electrons recombined with protons forming hydrogen atoms. At this point, the universe became transparent to most electromagnetic radiation. That 3,000 K surface, red-shifted by a factor of about 1,000, generates the 3 K cosmic microwave background radiation, which pervades the universe today. ==See also== *List of plasma (physics) articles == References == ==External links== *Derivation & Discussion by Hale Bradt *A detailed derivation from the University of Utah Physics Department *Lecture notes from the University of Maryland Department of Astronomy Category:Atomic physics Category:Plasma physics ","title":"Saha ionization equation"},{"id":"1438664","text":"Graf Zeppelin may refer to: * Count Ferdinand Adolf Heinrich August Graf von Zeppelin (1838–1917), German officer, engineer, and founder of the Zeppelin airship company * LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, a German rigid airship 1928–1937, named after Count Zeppelin * LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II, the second airship of the Hindenburg class, 1938–1940, named after Count Zeppelin * Graf Zeppelin- class aircraft carriers, two German Kriegsmarine aircraft carriers laid down in the mid-1930s, named after Count Zeppelin ** German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, the first ship of this class * The Graf Zeppelin March, a musical composition by Carl Teike (1864–1922) ==See also== *Zeppelin (disambiguation) *1930 Graf Zeppelin stamps ","title":"Graf Zeppelin"},{"id":"1438665","text":"is a town in Kamikawa Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 4,609 and a density of 6.9 persons per km².

M. or CM—is a poetic metre consisting of four lines that alternate between iambic tetrameter (four metrical feet per line) and iambic trimeter (three metrical feet per line), with each foot consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. The metre is denoted by the syllable count of each line, i.e. 8.6.8.6, 86.86, or 86 86, depending on style, or by its shorthand abbreviation \\"CM\\". Common metre has been used for ballads such as \\"Tam Lin\\" and hymns such as \\"Amazing Grace\\" and the Christmas carol \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\". The upshot of this commonality is that lyrics of one song can be sung to the tune of another; for example, \\"Advance Australia Fair\\", \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", and \\"Amazing Grace\\" can have their lyrics set to the tune of any of the others. Historically, lyrics were not always wedded to tunes and would therefore be sung to any fitting melody; \\"Amazing Grace\\", for instance, was not set to the tune \\"New Britain\\" (with which it is most commonly associated today) until fifty-six years after its initial publication in 1779. ==Variants== Common metre is related to other poetic forms. ===Ballad metre=== Like common metre, ballad metre comprises couplets of tetrameter (four feet) and trimeter (three feet). However, the feet need not be iambs (with one unstressed and one stressed syllable): the number of unstressed syllables is variable. Ballad metre is \\"less regular and more conversational\\" than common metre. In each stanza, ballad form typically needs to rhyme only the second lines of the couplets, not the first, in the form A-B-C-B (where A and C need not rhyme), while common metre typically rhymes both the first lines and the second lines, in the pattern A-B-A-B. ===Fourteener=== The fourteener is a metrical line of 14 syllables (usually seven iambic feet). Fourteeners typically occur in couplets. Fourteener couplets broken into quatrains (four-line stanzas) are equivalent to quatrains in common metre or ballad metre: instead of alternating lines of tetrameter and trimeter, a fourteener joins the tetrameter and trimeter lines to give seven feet per line. The fourteener gives the poet greater flexibility than common metre, in that its long lines invite the use of variably placed caesuras and spondees to achieve metrical variety, in place of a fixed pattern of iambs and line breaks. ===Common-metre double and particular=== Another common adaptation of the common metre is the common-metre double, which as the name suggests, is the common metre repeated twice in each stanza, or 8.6.8.6.8.6.8.6. Traditionally the rhyming scheme should also be double the common metre and be a-b-a-b-c-d-c-d, but it often uses the ballad metre style, resulting in x-a-x- a-x-b-x-b. Examples of this variant are \\"America the Beautiful\\" and \\"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\\". Likewise related is the common particular metre, 8.8.6.8.8.6., as in the tune Magdalen College, composed in 1774 by William Hayes, which has been used with the hymn \\"We Sing of God, the Mighty Source\\", by Christopher Smart.The Hymnal of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, 1940, New York: Church Pension Fund, Hymn 314. ==Examples== Common metre is often used in hymns, like this one by John Newton. William Wordsworth's \\"Lucy Poems\\" are also in common metre. The first opening theme used on the dubbed version of the Japanese anime Pokémon also uses common metre. Many of the poems of Emily Dickinson use ballad metre. Another American poem in ballad metre is Ernest Thayer's \\"Casey at the Bat\\": A modern example of ballad metre is the theme song to Gilligan's Island, infamously making it possible to sing any other ballad to that tune. The first two lines actually contain anapaests in place of iambs. This is an example of a ballad metre which is metrically less strict than common metre. Another example is the folk song \\"House of the Rising Sun\\". \\"Gascoigns Good Night\\", by George Gascoigne, employs fourteeners. \\"America the Beautiful\\" by Katharine Lee Bates employs the common metre double, using a standard CM rhyme scheme for the first iteration, and a ballad metre scheme for the second.

His distinctive guitar style featured a slow- burning sound and long bent notes. With qualities similar to the styles of other 1950s artists Magic Sam and Buddy Guy, his sound became known as West Side Chicago blues and was an influence on many musicians, including Michael Bloomfield, Peter Green and Eric Clapton. Rush was left-handed and played as such; however, his guitars were strung with the low E string at the bottom, upside-down from typical guitarists. He often played with the little finger of his pick hand curled under the low E for positioning. It is widely believed that this contributed to his distinctive sound. He had a wide-ranging, powerful tenor voice. ==Early life== The son of farmers Julia Campbell Boyd and Otis C. Rush, Rush was born near Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1934. Rush was one of seven children and worked on a farm throughout his childhood. At the age of eight, Rush taught himself how to play guitar; he also sang in local church choirs. ==Career== Rush moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1948/49Joel Whitburn's Top R&B; Singles 1942–1988 (Record Research) and, after being inspired by Muddy Waters, made a name for himself playing in blues clubs on the South and West Side of the city. During this period he formed his own group, initially under the name Little Otis. From 1956 to 1958, he recorded for the independent label Cobra Records and released eight singles, some featuring Ike Turner or Jody Williams on guitar. His first single, \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", in 1956 reached number 6 on the Billboard R&B; chart. During his tenure with Cobra, he recorded some of his best-known songs, such as \\"Double Trouble\\" and \\"All Your Love (I Miss Loving).\\" Cobra Records went bankrupt in 1959, and Rush signed a recording contract with Chess Records in 1960. He recorded eight tracks for the label, four of which were released on two singles that year. Six tracks, including the two singles, were later included on the album Door to Door in 1969, a compilation also featuring Chess recordings by Albert King. Rush went into the studio for Duke Records in 1962, but only one single, \\"Homework\\" backed with \\"I Have to Laugh\\", was issued by the label. It was also released in Great Britain as Vocalion VP9260 in 1963. In 1965, he recorded for Vanguard; these recordings are included on the label's compilation album Chicago/The Blues/Today! Vol. 2. Rush began playing in other cities in the United States and in Europe during the 1960s, notably with the American Folk Blues Festival. In 1969, his album Mourning in the Morning was released by Cotillion Records. Recorded at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, the album was produced by Michael Bloomfield and Nick Gravenites (then of the band Electric Flag). The sound incorporated soul music and rock, a new direction for Rush. In 1971, Rush recorded the album Right Place, Wrong Time in San Francisco for Capitol Records, but Capitol did not release it. The album was finally issued in 1976, when Rush purchased the master from Capitol and had it released by P-Vine Records in Japan. Bullfrog Records released it in the United States soon after. The album has since gained a reputation as one of his best works. He also released some albums for Delmark Records and for Sonet Records in Europe during the 1970s, but by the end of the decade he had stopped performing and recording. Rush made a comeback in 1985 with a U.S. tour and the release of a live album, Tops, recorded at the San Francisco Blues Festival. Rush performing in 2002 Rush released Ain't Enough Comin' In in 1994, his first studio album in 16 years. Any Place I'm Goin' followed in 1998, and he earned his first Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1999. Rush did not record a new studio album after 1998 but he continued to tour and perform until 2003, when he suffered a stroke. In 2002, he was featured on the Bo Diddley tribute album Hey Bo Diddley – A Tribute!, performing the song \\"I'm a Man\\", produced by Carla Olson. Rush's 2006 album Live...and in Concert from San Francisco, a live recording from 1999, was released by Blues Express Records. Video footage of the same show was released on the DVD Live Part 1 in 2003. In June 2016, Rush made a rare appearance at the Chicago Blues Festival in Grant Park. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel honored Rush's appearance by declaring June 12 to be Otis Rush Day in Chicago. Due to his ongoing health problems Rush was unable to play, but was present with his family. ==Awards== Rush was elected to the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Rush number 53 on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list. The Jazz Foundation of America honored Rush with a Lifetime Achievement Award on April 20, 2018 \\"for a lifetime of genius and leaving an indelible mark in the world of blues and the universal language of music.\\" ==Death== Rush died on September 29, 2018, from complications of a stroke. His death was announced on his website by his wife Masaki. OtisRush.net. Retrieved 29 September 2018 Gregg Parker, CEO and a founder of the Chicago Blues Museum said of Rush: \\"He was one of the last great blues guitar heroes. He was an electric god\\". Writing in The New York Times, Bill Friskics-Warren said, \\"A richly emotive singer and a guitarist of great skill and imagination, Mr. Rush was in the vanguard of a small circle of late-1950s innovators, including Buddy Guy and Magic Sam, whose music, steeped in R&B;, heralded a new era for Chicago blues.\\" ==Material loss== On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Rush among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==Selected discography== ===Original albums=== *1968 This One's a Good One (Blue Horizon) *1969 Mourning in the Morning (Cotillion) *1972 Blues Masters, Vol. 2 *1974 Screamin' and Cryin' (Black & Blue) *1975 Cold Day in Hell (Delmark) *1976 So Many Roads (Delmark) *1976 Right Place, Wrong Time (Bullfrog) *1978 Troubles Troubles (Sonet) *1988 Tops (Blind Pig) *1989 Blues Interaction – Live in Japan 1986 (P-Vine) *1991 Lost in the Blues (Alligator ALCD4797) *1993 Live in Europe (Evidence Music ECD 26034-2) *1994 Ain't Enough Comin' In (This Way Up/Mercury) *1998 Any Place I'm Going (House of Blues) *2006 Live...and in Concert from San Francisco (Blues Express) *2009 Chicago Blues Festival 2001 (P-Vine) *2015 Double Trouble LIVE Cambridge 1973 (RockBeat Records) ===Compilation albums=== *1969 Door to Door, with Albert King (Chess) *1989 I Can't Quit You Baby: The Cobra Sessions 1956–1958 (P-Vine) *2000 Good 'Uns: The Classic Cobra Recordings 1956–1958 (Westside) *2000 The Essential Otis Rush: The Classic Cobra Recordings 1956–1958 (Fuel 2000) *2002 Blue on Blues: Buddy Guy & Otis Rush (Fuel 2000) *2005 All Your Love I Miss Loving: Live at the Wise Fools Pub, Chicago (Delmark) *2006 Live at Montreux 1986 (Eagle Rock Entertainment) (joint performance with Eric Clapton and Luther Allison) *2015 Double Trouble: Live Cambridge 1973 (Rockbeat Records ROCCD 3220) ===Singles=== * 1956 \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" / \\"Sit Down Baby\\" (Cobra 5000) * 1956 \\"My Love Will Never Die\\" / \\"Violent Love\\" (Cobra 5005) * 1957 \\"Groaning the Blues\\" / \\"If You Were Mine\\" (Cobra 5010) * 1957 \\"Jump Sister Bessie\\" / \\"Love That Woman\\" (Cobra 5015) * 1957 \\"She's a Good 'Un\\" / \\"Three Times a Fool\\" (Cobra 5023) * 1958 \\"Checking on My Baby\\" / \\"It Takes Time\\" (Cobra 5027) * 1958 \\"Double Trouble\\" / \\"Keep On Loving Me Baby\\" (Cobra 5030) * 1958 \\"All Your Love (I Miss Loving)\\" / \\"My Baby's a Good 'Un\\" (Cobra 5032) * 1960 \\"So Many Roads So Many Trains\\" / \\"I'm Satisfied\\" (Chess 1751) * 1960 \\"You Know My Love\\" / \\"I Can't Stop Baby\\" (Chess 1775) * 1962 \\"Homework\\" / \\"I Have to Laugh\\" (Duke 356) * 1969 \\"Gambler's Blues\\" / \\"You're Killing My Love\\" (Cotillion 44032) ===DVDs === *2003 Live Part One (Blues Express) *2006 Live at Montreux 1986 (Eagle Rock Entertainment) ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Carlo Rotello, \\"Otis Rush,\\" New York Times Magazine, Dec. 27, 2018. ==External links== * Official website * * Otis Rush at setlist.fm * Obituary at Rolling Stone * Obituary at ultimateclassicrock.com Category:1934 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Chicago blues musicians Category:Electric blues musicians Category:Singers from Mississippi Category:African-American musicians Category:American blues singers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Singers from Chicago Category:People from Philadelphia, Mississippi Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Alligator Records artists Category:Chess Records artists Category:Delmark Records artists Category:Duke Records artists Category:Vanguard Records artists Category:P-Vine Records artists Category:Cobra Records artists Category:Blues musicians from Mississippi Category:Male guitarists Category:Guitarists from Chicago Category:Guitarists from Mississippi Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th- century American male musicians Category:Deaths from cerebrovascular disease Category:Black & Blue Records artists Category:Blind Pig Records artists ","title":"Otis Rush"},{"id":"1438688","text":"is a town located in Rumoi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

It is situated between Laceby Road (A46) and Scartho Road (A1243), which respectively form its northern and eastern boundaries. The population is listed in the South ward of the North East Lincolnshire Unitary Council. There are over 2,400 homes on the estate, mostly former council properties now owned by the Lincolnshire Housing Partnership. There is a small area belonging to the Havelok/Northern Counties housing associations and a small area of private sector housing. There are a number of privately owned former council houses purchased under the Right to Buy scheme. The pre-Second World War development in the eastern part of the estate is known as Old Nunsthorpe while the post-war development is called New Nunsthorpe. To the west lies the Bradley Park Estate which contains around 430 dwellings, also mostly LHP properties. The combined population of Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park is approximately 8,000. To the north, on the other side of Laceby Road, is the Grange Estate and on the eastern boundary, in Scartho Road, was Grimsby Swimming Pool, which closed and was subsequently demolished.Scartho Baths closure: Council urges people to back new pool and not look to the past .

A quality mark was awarded after an independent assessment of improvement work undertaken on the estate by Shoreline and partners, Humberside Police and North East Lincolnshire Council, with the assistance of residents.'Award shows Nunsthorpe is great place to live'. This is Grimsby (10 February 2010). ==Origins== Although built in the 20th century, Nunsthorpe takes its name from the nuns who once inhabited the priory of Saint Leonard.House of Austin nuns – The priory of St Leonard, Grimsby  A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 (pp. 179). British-history.ac.uk (22 June 2003). This stood at modern day Nuns Corner, where Scartho Road joins Laceby Road. \\"Thorpe\\" was an old word for hamlet or village. The priory was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1539. In later years the land was occupied by Nuns Farm, until its demolition in 1935. In 1944 Grimsby College, now called The Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education, acquired the site. Situated at the southern edge of Grimsby (before the boundary extensions), for centuries the land where Nunsthorpe now stands was farmed using the open field system of agriculture. Lying mainly within the town of Grimsby it stretched westward from the priory, as far as the boundary with Bradley parish and southward, beyond the boundary with the parish of Scartho. Under enclosure awards of 1798 (in Scartho) and 1840 (in Grimsby), this land was acquired by successive Lords Yarborough. ==Old Nunsthorpe== Dame Kendal Grove Following the end of the First World War decent homes were needed for the returning servicemen. House building was started by Grimsby County Borough Council in 1920, on land bought from Lord Yarborough. Originally called the Laceby Road Site until 1923 the new Nunsthorpe housing estate, with its modern conveniences and large gardens was, as previously mentioned, also known as Garden City. Most of the streets in this early development, built during the 1920s and 1930s, were named after notable people – Burns, Byron, Kingsley, Leighton, Newton, Walton groves; Milton Road and Shelley Avenue. Dame Kendal Grove was named after a Grimsby- born actress while Sutcliffe Avenue was named after Jack Sutcliffe, a previous mayor of Grimsby. Saint Martin's Mission Church, a wooden building, was built during 1922 in Sutcliffe Avenue; this was replaced by a new church in 1937. There is still a structure on this site which is currently the base for Grimsby Judo Club. The first shops, including a post office, were built in Second Avenue during 1927–28 and a bus service (route 3) was introduced from Grimsby town centre to Nunsthorpe in 1928. In later years this service was extended to Cleethorpes. Also in 1928 the greater part of Scartho was absorbed by Grimsby, which brought the whole of the present Nunsthorpe area under the control of Grimsby council. At the same time part of Bradley parish was acquired on which the Bradley Park Estate would eventually be built. Nunsthorpe's population was further increased when, resulting from the Housing Act of 1930, slum clearance was carried out in the Grimsby town centre and the residents were moved to new houses on the estate. By 1939 around 700 houses had been built in Nunsthorpe. Nunsthorpe School was opened on Sutcliffe Avenue in 1931; previously children from the estate had been bussed to a school in another part of the town. It was two schools housed within one building, one for junior and one for senior pupils. By 1952 all the senior children had been transferred to a new school in Chelmsford Avenue. During the late 1920s a maternity hospital was established in Second Avenue using converted council houses. This was incorporated into a new building which opened in 1933. In 1943 a number of people were killed and houses were damaged when butterfly bombs were dropped on the estate during a German air raid on Grimsby. ==New Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park== The absorption of Scartho into Grimsby made available more land for house building. The pre-1928 boundary between Grimsby and Scartho ran past the Scartho Road Institution (now part of the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital) to what is the present-day rear gate of the hospital grounds at the end of Second Avenue, next to the resource centre. From there it continued westward through fields that would eventually become part of the New Nunsthorpe council housing development. It ran south of what is now Redbourne Road, crossed Winchester Avenue, ran to the north of Kirkstead Crescent, along Scawby Road until it reached Stainton Drive. The amalgamation made this boundary obsolete. In this post-Second World War New Nunsthorpe development the streets were mostly named after Lincolnshire villages, with the exception of Winchester Avenue and a few streets in an area of private housing, which were named after historic English towns. The development included the single-storey prefabricated buildings (prefabs), which were built in 1946 to help alleviate the housing shortage. In 1947 a large wooden hut was purchased and erected in Burwell Drive. This became the estate's earliest community centre, opened in 1949, at the same time the Nunsthorpe's first community association was formed. In 1951 saw the Nunsthorpe Nursery School opened, and in 1952 the branch library in Wootton Road was established. In 1963 the Viking Superstore, which had been converted from three smaller shops into one self-service supermarket, was opened in Second Avenue. Coronation Street stars Pat Phoenix and Philip Lowrie addressed an estimated crowd of 5,000 people in the open air before the official openingCoronation Street stars in store on estate. This is Grimsby (28 April 2012). During the late 1970s the Bradley Park Estate was built on land between Stainton Drive and the Bradley Recreation Ground. This land had once been part of Bradley parish. Some place names in Bradley Park, such as Bremerhaven Way, reflect Grimsby's links with its twin town, although Wymark View was named after the actor who was born in nearby Cleethorpes. Dolby Vale took its name from Sidney Vere Dolby, a long-serving radiologist at Grimsby General Hospital. The development also included Crosby School (now called Woodlands). ==Improvement schemes and resident consultation== Welcome to Nunsthorpe sign In 1992, for purposes of resident consultation, Grimsby borough council, then a district of Humberside County Council, divided the area into four neighbourhoods. Because of its size New Nunsthorpe was split into two neighbourhoods – Nunsthorpe Central and Nunsthorpe West, while Old Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park formed the remaining two. Each area had a steering committee. At that time discussions were taking place on the possibility of setting up a tenant management organisation in each neighbourhood. Independent housing consultants, Priority Estates Project, were brought in to canvass the views of residents but nothing developed from this idea. In 1994 the Department for the Environment approved multimillion-pound funding for Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park. This Estate Action scheme allowed for internal improvements to council houses and general improvements, such as better street lighting, the provision of off-road parking facilities and dropped kerbs for the convenience of wheelchair users. It also included the installation of traffic calming measures. All the prefabs of aluminium construction were renovated and are still in use. However, most of the prefabs containing asbestos were demolished between 1994 and 1997. Of the original 181 such prefabs only three owner- occupied ones now remain. Local housing association, Havelok and the Northern Counties housing association, were allocated part of the vacant prefab land for the construction of properties. Some of the land remained empty, part of it forming the open grassed area situated between Burwell Drive and Winchester Avenue. ===Consultative forum=== The Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Consultative Forum, established in 1992 to co-ordinate the neighbourhood steering groups, was reorganised and became directly elected by a postal ballot of residents at two yearly periods. The reconstituted forum held its inaugural meeting in 1995, with annual general meetings being held thereafter. In addition to the delegates elected from 13 areas (later reduced to six), ward councillors and council officers also attended meetings of the main committee and sub- committees. The forum was dissolved in 2004. The forum had three sub- committees, one being the Economic, Social and Cultural Development sub- committee (ESCD). Another sub-committee dealt with council tenant issues only, while the third concerned itself with wider estate action improvements, which affected tenants and homeowners. As circumstances changed, these sub- committees were gradually merged with the main committee. Representatives from local churches, schools, the police and other bodies were invited to attend ESCD meetings as observers. Along with various local agencies, the ESCD had delegates on the project team charged with establishing a resource centre on the estate. When the Sutcliffe Special School moved to a new site at Humberston, the empty building in Second Avenue was acquired from the local council at a nominal rent. Resident volunteers helped to clean and decorate the building, transforming it into the new Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Resource Centre. The project was funded initially from the Single Regeneration Budget, although the aim was for the centre eventually to become self- financing. Two residents associations, Bradley Park and Nunsthorpe Central, which existed between 1993 and 1999, sent voting delegates to the forum. These associations had replaced the steering committees for their respective neighbourhoods. They were also closely involved with the establishment of the resource centre. Previously operating from members' homes, when the centre opened in 1995 the associations were able to establish permanent headquarters there. Attempts to set up resident associations in Old Nunsthorpe and Nunsthorpe West were unsuccessful; however, from 1996 Old Nunsthorpe and Nunsthorpe Central residents began holding joint meetings. A Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Youth Association (now defunct) was established in 1996, supervised by the two adult associations. National Lottery funding enabled this organisation to employ a full-time youth worker based at the resource centre. During 1997, disillusionment among some residents on Bradley Park led to the brief formation of a second association there, in opposition to the existing resident group. Also in that year, some people, who were dissatisfied with the Nunsthorpe Central Association, established the short-lived Nunsthorpe South Association. ===Council housing stock transfer=== In 2004 tenants in North East Lincolnshire were balloted on whether the council housing stock should be transferred to a housing association. Transfer would release money that was unavailable to the council for improvements to properties. After a \\"yes\\" vote the remaining council houses on the two estates (around 1,600), together with the rest of the authority's housing stock, were transferred to the new locally based Shoreline Housing Partnership in March 2005. Shoreline tenants on the estates sent two delegates to the Boroughwide Tenant Assembly. One delegate represented Nunsthorpe East and Nunsthorpe Central while the other represented Nunsthorpe West and Bradley Park. The Assembly was later disbanded. Shoreline undertook a programme of investment in the transferred properties over a period of ten years and is currently in the process of implementing this programme. Planned home improvements include, where necessary, modern kitchens, bathrooms, central heating, decent roofs, security doors and windows, as well as smoke alarms. However, there are still parts of Nunsthorpe where it is difficult to attract tenants and houses remain boarded up. ==Former community organisations== Defunct community organisations include the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Residents and Tenants Association established in 2005, later changing its name to the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Trust. It opened a charity shop in Second Avenue, provided by the neighbouring Co-op shop at a nominal rent and staffed by volunteers from the estate. The shop closed in 2012, with the Trust blaming lack of support from funding organisations as the reason.Volunteers needed to continue couple's work on Grimsby's Nunsthorpe Estate. This is Grimsby (4 February 2012). During its time the premises hosted a single-parent club, photographic club, dancing and bingo. Money was raised to help fund the children's ward at the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital, Nunsthorpe Community School, the Side Door Youth Club (based at Laceby Road Methodist Church), also the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Football Club. The Trust received a number of awards and commendations for its charity work.Nunsthorpe And Bradley Park Community Trust closes shop. This is Grimsby (24 April 2012). The Nunsthorpe Tenants and Residents Association was formed in 2006 and was involved in combating anti- social behaviour on the estate. It joined the campaign to restore the Nunsthorpe Recreation Ground following damage by vandals.PROTECTING the Nunsthorpe's new playground from vandals will be child's play – provided the community pulls together.. This is Grimsby (11 April 2011). Working with the Saint Martins Action Group (now Nunsthorpe Together) Nunsthorpe TARA provided a float for the 2006 Cleethorpes Carnival. During its existence the organisation arranged various outdoor activities for local children. It disbanded in 2013. The Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Partnership was an umbrella group that included the Nunsthorpe Community Centre, Nunsthorpe TARA, the Respect Funhouse and the Second Avenue Resource Centre. It entered three floats in the 2009 Cleethorpes Carnival, coming second in one section and joint first in another section. It is now part of the South Ward Partnership mentioned below.Float along and get on board!. This is Grimsby (29 April 2009). In 2003 a quarterly magazine called Livewire was introduced. Livewire gave news and views from around Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park. It incorporated the resource centre newsletter, Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Matters, which had been regularly distributed to houses in the area since 1995. The magazine relied on funding and this eventually came to an end. The last edition appeared in 2008. ==Current community organisations== Community groups currently operating on the estate include the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Community Association and Nunsthorpe Together. Other organisations include the Second Avenue Resource Centre (formerly the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Resource Centre), which opened in 1995. Its management board includes residents of the estate. The centre's services include the provisions of rooms for hire, sports facilities and computers for Internet access. Rented office space is also available. A number of organisations are based at the centre, including North East Lincolnshire Carelink, which operates a 24-hour monitoring system for vulnerable people. In 2006 the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park United Football Club, composed of young people, was formed with the support of Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Residents and Tenants Association. The Cabourne Road Tenants and Residents Association was formed in 2010. This association campaigns to eliminate anti-social behaviour in the street. It is trying to get measures introduced to prevent traffic speeding along the street and is also pushing for improvements to the road surface. South Ward Partnership, which includes Nunsthorpe, Bradley Park and the Grange Estate, is composed of residents and representatives from various agencies, working to improve conditions on the estates. Membership of the partnership is open to all residents of the ward aged 16 and over. Non-residents with an interest in the area may attend meetings without voting rights. It meets at various venues within the ward area.Closure threat to community forum. This is Grimsby (30 July 2011). The Nunsthorpe Young Peoples Service, run by North East Lincolnshire Council, is based in Wootton Road. There is also the Nunsthorpe Environmental Group, which in 2010 received £2,000 from the council's Community Pride Grant. There is a neighbourhood watch group based in Byron Grove. The Hands Together Youth Group, based on the estate, put together shoe boxes full of essential items and sent them to the children of Romania for Christmas 2010. In 2011 they decided to do something for the men and women serving in the armed forces. They handed over 20 shoeboxes full of items such as toothpaste, shampoo and aftershave, to the Pink Berets fundraising group, for the troops in Afghanistan. In 2011 a street party was held on the estate to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. At the event, held in Redbourne Road, youngsters became princes and princesses for a day. Dressed in costumes made by event organiser Mary Stuart, children from the estate recreated the royal wedding ceremony.Tell us how you're celebrating – or escaping – the royal wedding!.

One at the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Children's Centre involved the opening of a new garden, combined with a Jubilee event. At Woodlands School pupils were asked to dress up in post-1952 costumes as part of their Jubilee celebration. A street party was also held in Redbourne Road. Nunsthorpe resident, Doreen White, was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to education while working at Franklin College. She had dedicated her working life to the college, first as a cleaner and later as a social area supervisor.MBE for Grimsby woman Doreen White. This is Grimsby (20 June 2012).

Activities include bingo and auctions. The centre was opened in 1985 by local snooker celebrity Ray Edmonds. The association existed from 1985 to 1994 and was re-established in 2004, following the dissolution of the Nunsthorpe and Bradley Park Forum. In 2007 the association received £14,320 from the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and Millennium Inorganic Chemicals. The money paid for alterations to the centre's ceiling, repairs to the heating system and the installation of safety glass in the doors and windows. In 2012 the centre was the scene of a disturbance involving local youths.Trapped and under siege as mob of 50 youths riot on Grimsby's Nunsthorpe estate . This is Grimsby (28 March 2012). Nunsthorpe Together was composed of representatives from the church, police and North East Lincolnshire Council. In 2008 it took over control of the Respect Funhouse from the Saint Martins Action Group. During its existence the Action Group staged local productions of Abbamania and Dancemania at the Grimsby Auditorium, both involving local children from North East Lincolnshire. Action Group members supported by a local police inspector and the Rector of Grimsby, appeared on the TV show Fortune: Million Pound Giveaway, appealing for funds to turn part of Saint Martin's church into a children's activity centre. The panel awarded them £45,000, while a further £330,000 came from the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund. The project was officially opened in 2008. The Respect Funhouse had a Laser Quest arena, a multi-screen video jukebox and a maze of play areas – tunnels, slides, ball pools and climbing areas – also music rooms and quiet rooms where teenagers and children could do their homework. In 2008 young dancers from the Funhouse performed their fourth show, Musical Mania, at the Auditorium. The dancers stage regular events at the Beachcomber venue in Humberston. In 2009 the High Sheriff of Lincolnshire, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, handed a Tribune Trust award for £1,000 to the Funhouse. The Trust supports community projects tackling crime, disorder and deprivation. The Funhouse decided to spend the money on T-shirts for its street dance teams.White, Lillian.

The games for this system are in the modular form of circuit boards that are plugged into one of the ten open slots on the PlayChoice-10's motherboard. == Description and history == Having found success in the home console market with the NES, Nintendo developed arcade hardware to run its most popular NES games inside an arcade cabinet. Dubbed the PlayChoice-10, the machine was compatible with the NES, but with some key differences. An extra CPU controlled the gameplay timer, game select, and displayed hints for the current game on a separate monitor. On single-monitor systems, a button would switch between gameplay and the hint screen. Most normal NES cartridges could not be used; rather, the PlayChoice used special expansion cards containing NES games along with an extra 8KB ROM to display hints. Because the PlayChoice-10 outputs RGB video using a slightly different palette, games did not look exactly the same as they did on the NES. It is in fact possible to replace the NES PPU with the PlayChoice-10 PPU, allowing it to output RGB natively. Each machine had a different mix of games in it. Instead of a player getting to play one game until it was finished, the player got a fixed time limit to play as many PlayChoice games as they wanted to. Nintendo created several variations of the hardware, including a standalone PlayChoice unit which only had a single available game. By the late 1980s, other companies developed similar systems. Sega's Mega-Tech and Mega Play hardware was capable of running certain Sega Master System and/or Sega Mega Drive/Genesis games. SNK's Neo Geo was another cartridge-based system that was made available for both arcades and home consoles. Nintendo announced on July 31, 1992 that it would no longer manufacture arcade equipment. ==List of available games== The following is a list of all 52 games that were made available on various PlayChoice-10 machines. ===First party=== * Balloon Fight (1986) * Baseball (1986) * Dr. Mario (1990), or its prototype version Virus in some machines * Duck Hunt (1986) * Excitebike (1986) * Golf (1986) * Hogan's Alley (1986) * Kung Fu (1986) * Mario Bros.

The town is bisected by the Enbetsu River, which flows from the Teshio Mountains directly into the Sea of Japan. Enbetsu is the northernmost area of rice production in Japan. ==Etymology== The name of the town of Enbetsu has its origin in the Ainu language. Three possibilities exist: Wen-pet, meaning \\"bad river\\"; \\"We-bet\\", meaning \\"forked river\\"; or \\"E-ye-pet\\", meaning \\"meeting place river\\", as Enbetsu was a meeting place of the seaside Ainu and the Ainu of the Teshio Mountains. ==Geography== Asahi Spa, Kotoura Enbetsu is located at the north-northwest of the island of Hokkaido and overlooks the Japan Sea. The town occupies the drainage basin of the Enbetsu River from its origin on the western slopes of the Teshio Mountains to its mouth at the Sea of Japan. The west of the town is forested and sparsely inhabited. The small commercial and residential center of the town is located at the mouth of the river on the Japan Sea. Enbetsu is home to an onsen hot spring resort, the Asahi Spa in Kotoura. A small mud volcano is located in the marshes in the immediate vicinity of the hot spring. ===Rivers=== The Enbetsu River () flows from its source in the Teshio Mountains on the border of Enbetsu and Horokanai, north-northwest through the town and into the Sea of Japan. The city center and town hall are all located at the mouth of the Enbetsu. Major tributaries of the Enbetsu include the Takinosawa, Kumanosawa, Nupuripaomanai, Nupurikeshiomappu, and Rubeshube rivers. Nearly of the Enbetsu is used for rice paddy agriculture. The rice paddies of the Enbetsu make up the northernmost border of the wide belt of rice production in Japan; the town is therefore known as the northernmost area of rice production in the country. A stone monument to the history of rice production in Japan was constructed in Enbetsu in 1957. ===Mountains=== Mount Pisshiri (), the highest point in Enbetsu, is located to the very south of the town on its border with the towns Haboro and Horokanai. Pisshiri is the highest peak in the Teshio Mountains, and is also the source of the Enbetsu River. ===Neighboring municipalities=== Enbetsu borders on five municipalities in Hokkaido Prefecture, three in Rumoi Subprefecture and two in Kamikawa Subprefecture: *Rumoi Subprefecture **Teshio **Haboro **Shosanbetsu *Kamikawa Subprefecture **Nakagawa **Horokanai ==Climate== Teshio is noted for its harsh climate. It has numerous days of rain, few days of sunlight, and strong winds. Temperatures vary widely. The highest recorded temperature in Enbetsu was in 1979, and the lowest was in 2000. Winds off the Sea of Japan coast support wind farms in the town. ==History== The first recorded Japanese settler of Enbetsu was Gentarō Shirahata, who moved to Enbetsu in 1896. A group of settlers from Echizen, Fukui Prefecture called the Echizen Dantai came to Enbetsu in the following year. Groups from Aichi, Chiba, and Kumamoto followed, as well as individual settlers. Enbetsu, which had previously been part of Teshio, was established as a separate village in 1909. Rice production was tested as early as 1897, specifically with strains of rice from Fukui Prefecture. After testing numerous strains from other parts of Honshu, 1921 saw a successful rice crop in Enbetsu, and the start of an agricultural industry in the village. Enbetsu was elevated to town status in 1949. The town grew to a population of 8,944 in 1958, and has entered into a period of sustained depopulation. Both the agriculture and fishing industries of Enbetsu have fallen into decline, notably with the decline of the Pacific herring catch. Younger people from Enbetsu have migrated to work in larger cities in Hokkaido and Honshu, contributing to the depopulation of the town. ==Economy== The primary agricultural product of Enbetsu is rice, specifically of glutinous rice for the preparation of mochi. Asparagus and melons are also grown in the town. The local economy also depends on dairy farming and fishing. Enbetsu is a source of flounder and Yesso scallops. ==Schools== The Town of Enbetsu Board of Education maintains one elementary school, Enbetsu Elementary School, and one junior high school, Enbetsu Junior High School. The elementary school is located to the northeast of the Town Hall, in the central Honchō district, while the junior high school is located to the southeast, in the eastern Kōwa district. Enbetsu also maintains a single municipal preschool, which is located next to the elementary school. Hokkaido Enbetsu Agricultural High School, a prefectural high school, is located in the Kitahama district of the town, a short distance from the town center. The high school was founded in 1952. ==Transportation== Roadside Station Fujimi Enbetsu was once connected to the rest of Hokkaido by the JR Hokkaido Haboro Line. The line, completed in 1958, connected Rumoi with Sapporo. Utakoshi, Teshiokanaura, Enbetsu, Keimeikarijōkōjō, and Marumatsu were all stations on the line located in Enbetsu. The Haboro Line was discontinued in March 1987. Currently, the closest JR Hokkaido train stations accessible from Enbetsu via public transport is located in Horonobe, to the north, and Rumoi, to the south. ===Bus=== The JR Haboro Line was replaced by the Engan Bus Company. Enbetsu Station is now used as a bus terminal. ===Roads=== Enbetsu can be reached by car from Sapporo in approximately four hours, from Asahikawa in three hours, and from Wakkanai or Rumoi in an hour and a half. Japan National Route 232 crosses the town from north to south along the Japan Sea coast. ==Hospital== Enbetsu has a single hospital, the Enbetsu National Health Insurance Hospital. The hospital, a municipal facility, was constructed in 1951, and is located in the central Honchō district of the town. Enbetsu National Health Insurance Hospital is the only hospital between Wakkanai to the north and Rumoi to the south. ==Internationality== Starting in 1989, Enbetsu has maintained a sister city relationship with Castlegar, BC. As part of the relationship, an educational exchange program occurs each summer between the town and city. Students visit their counterpart in alternating years, fostering an understanding of differing cultures and way of living. ==References== ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ","title":"Enbetsu, Hokkaido"},{"id":"1438708","text":"Washington Park Washington Park is a neighborhood in east central Seattle, Washington, named after the city park to its northwest.

At the end of September 2016, the town had an estimated population of 2,415 and a density of 4.2 persons per km2. The total area is 574.27 km2. The north 45°latitude passes through this town. Horonobe is also known for its reindeer population and wind turbines located on its beaches. In October 2000, with the help of local government and NEDO,NEDO New Energy in Hokkaido, text in Japanese the Horonobe wind power generation project came into existence. Wind turbines were installed on trial-run basis along the 3.1 km coastline. Since February 2003, there are 28 turbines working in full capacity, with an individual output of 750 kW. In total its estimated that the wind turbines in Horonobe-chō generate 50 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, and this is supplied to Hokkaido Electric Power Company for distribution. This electricity is equivalent to annual electric consumption of about 10,000 Japanese households. Since 1998, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency started planning an underground research laboratory at Honorobe to be able to conduct tests on the suitability of sedimentary rock for use as a deep geological repository for Japan's spent nuclear fuel (a similar research facility in crystalline rock is also being constructed at Mizunami in Gifu Prefecture). Excavation began in 2003, and is scheduled for completion in 2017.JAEA R&D;R&D; in Horonobe, JAEA A possibility of making a geological carbon capture and storage (CCS) site is also under consideration at Honorobe. In 2010, the town of Horonobe was transferred from Rumoi Subprefecture to Sōya Subprefecture. ==Transportation== Horonobe is connected to Wakkanai in the north and Asahikawa in the south by train line Soya line. The nearest airport is Wakkanai Airport, about 53 km in the north. The other nearby airports are Asahikawa Airport about 199 km to the south and Monbetsu Airport about 192 km to the south-east and New Chitose Airport about 360 km to the south. ==References== ==External links== * *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ","title":"Horonobe, Hokkaido"},{"id":"1438721","text":"is a village located in Sōya Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

Sarufutsu has a fledgling tourist industry, as it is a highlight for motor bikers in the summer, who stop overnight at one of the biker camps. The tourist center is located a few kilometers south of Hamaonishibetsu. ==History== ===World War II=== During World War II, many Korean prisoners of war were sent to Sarufutsu, where they were kept as a labor force building an air field in Asajino. Approximately 80 Korean prisoners of war died over the course of construction from abuse or malnutrition. The air field was never completed, and since that time, has almost completely vanished. In recent year, the village made attempts to construct a monument in memory of the Korean prisoners who died there. However, construction was cancelled after Japanese nationalists orchestrated a protest movement via the internet. The village office was overwhelmed with threatening phone calls, who called the office workers traitors, and threatened the village with a boycott of its scallop industry. ===Settlements=== Koishi In the 1960s to early-1970s, Koishi was the largest settlement in Sarufutsu with several thousand people working in the coal industry. It had its own hospital, as well as a movie theater. With the decline of the coal industry across Japan, the population also drastically dropped in Koishi, and its current population is less than 50 people.

The seat of the municipality is the village Kanallaki. Parga lies on the Ionian coast between the cities of Preveza and Igoumenitsa. It is a resort town known for its natural environment. ==Municipality== The present municipality of Parga was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 2 former municipalities, that became municipal units: *Fanari *Parga The municipality has an area of 274.796 km2, the municipal unit 68.903 km2. ==History== View of the seafront In antiquity the area was inhabited by the Greek tribe of the Thesprotians. The ancient town of Toryne was probably located here. Parga itself is mentioned for the first time in 1318; the name is most likely of Slavic origin. Two years later, the town and its sugarcane plantation proceeds were unsuccessfully offered by Nicholas Orsini, the Despot of Epirus, to the Republic of Venice in exchange for Venetian aid against the Byzantine Empire. During the Epirote rebellion of 1338/39 against the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos, Parga remained loyal to the emperor. In the 1390s it was under the rule of John Spata, lord of Arta. The town finally passed under Venetian control in 1401, and was administered as a mainland exclave of the Venetian possession of Corfu, under a castellan. Venetian possession was confirmed in the Ottoman–Venetian treaty of 1419. Apart from brief periods of Ottoman possession, the town remained in Venetian hands until the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. In 1815, with the fortunes of the French failing, the citizens of Parga revolted against French rule and sought the protection of the British. In 1819, the British sold the city to Ali Pasha of Ioannina (the subject of Francesco Hayez's later painting The Refugees of Parga), and from him it passed under Ottoman rule. Ottoman rule in Parga and the rest of Epirus was ended in 1913 following the victory of Greece in the Balkan Wars. ==Castle of Parga== Depiction of the castle from a painting by Francesco Hayez (1791–1882). The Castle is found on the top of a hill overlooking the town and was used to protect the town from invasions from the mainland and the sea. It was initially built in the 11th century by the residents of Parga to protect their town from pirates and the Ottomans. In the 13th century, as their control of the region increased, the Venetians rebuilt the castle to fortify the area. In 1452, Parga and the castle were occupied by the Ottomans for two years; part of the castle was demolished at that time. In 1537, Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa burned and destroyed the fortress and the houses within. Before the reconstruction of the castle in 1572 by the Venetians, the Turks demolished it once again. The Venetians rebuilt it for the third and last time creating a stronger fortress that stayed impregnable until 1819, despite attacks, especially by Ali Pasha of Ioannina. Provisions for the castle were transported via two bays at Valtos and Pogonia. When Parga was sold to the Ottomans, Ali Pasha made structural additions to the castle, including a Turkish bath and his harem quarters which he built at the top of the fortress. On the arched gate at the wall of the castle entrance, the winged lion of Agios Markos is visible. Other entrance details include, the name “ANTONIO BERVASS 1764”, emblems of Ali Pasha, two-headed eagles and related inscriptions. ==Geography== A 360-degree panoramic image of Parga from the pier. The island of Panagia off the coast of Parga. The city of Parga, built amphitheatrically, stands between the mountainous coastal region of Preveza and Igoumenitsa. It is known as the \\"Bride of Epirus\\". In the summer, tourists arrive from Paxos, Antipaxos, and Corfu by boat. ===Beaches=== Parga attracts thousands of tourists. In its vicinity there are beaches including Valtos, Kryoneri, Piso Kryoneri, Lichnos, Sarakiniko and Ai Giannaki. Valtos Beach Panoramic view of Valtos beach Valtos Beach is one of the best and longest beaches of Parga. It is located near the castle of Parga. Because of its clear waters and proximity to Parga it attracts many tourists. Krioneri Beach Krioneri Beach, the main beach of Parga, lies a short distance from the town centre. The small island of Virgin Mary is situated across the bay.

Sarakiniko beach  Sarakiniko is a well-known beach, located on the west side of Agia village, near a small river and olive trees, approximately 12 km from the town centre. Small boats connect the beach with the port of Parga. ==Transport== Parga's overview Traditional houses The town of Parga is linked with direct suburban buses (KTEL) to other Greek cities and towns such as Igoumenitsa and Preveza. There are also indirect connections with Athens.

He is also associated with the American Precisionist movement of the 1910s–1940s. ==Biography and career== Stella was born to a middle-class family in Italy, in Muro Lucano, a village in the province of Potenza. His grandfather Antonio and his father Michele were attorneys,biographical information for this entry is taken from Salvatore Pagliuca Basilicata Regione. but he came to New York City in 1896 to study medicine, following in the foot steps of his older brother Doctor Antonio Stella.Biographical information for this entry is taken from Barbara Haskell and Irma Jaffe. However, he quickly abandoned his medical studies and turned instead to art, studying at the Art Students League and the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase. His first paintings were Rembrandtesque depictions of city slum life. A remarkable draftsman, he made drawings throughout the various phases of his career, beginning as an academic realist with a particular interest in immigrant and ethnic life. From 1905 to 1909, he worked as an illustrator, publishing his realist drawings in magazines. \\"He prowled the streets, sketch pad and pencil in hand, alert to catch the pose of the moment, the detail of costume or manner that told the story of a life.\\"Jaffe, p. 16. In 1908, he was commissioned for a series on industrial Pittsburgh, later published in The Pittsburgh Survey. Joseph Stella, 1913–14, Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras, oil on canvas, 195.6 × 215.3 cm (77 × 84.75 in), Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT Stella returned to Italy in 1909. He was unhappy with America, writing that he longed to be back in his native land after \\"an enforced stay among enemies, in a black funereal land over which weighed ... the curse of a merciless climate.\\"Hughes, p. 374. It was a well-timed decision. His return to Europe led to his first extensive contact with Modernism which would ultimately mold his distinctive personal style, notable for its strong color and sweeping and dynamic lines. By 1911, he had departed Italy, where the omnipresence of the Renaissance presented its own kind of obstacle for contemporary painters, and relocated to Paris. When he arrived, \\"Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism were in full swing,\\" he wrote, and \\"[there] was in the air the glamor of a battle.\\"Hughes, p. 375. It was the right place to be, at just the right time, for a man of Stella's curiosity, openness to new trends, and ambition. In Paris, Stella attended the salon of Gertrude Stein, where he met many other painters. \\"[Stein] found the big and boisterous painter rather like [her friend, the poet] Apollinaire; they both had a fund of sarcastic wit that was frequently turned on their hosts.\\" Stella's view of his hostess was indeed sarcastic: she sat, he wrote, \\"enthroned on a sofa in the middle of the room,\\" surrounded by her Cézannes and Picassos, \\"with the forceful solemnity of a pythoness or a sibyl ... in a high and distant pose.\\"James Mellow, Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein & Co. (New York, Henry Holt, 2003 edition), p. 181. Man Ray, 1920, Three Heads (Joseph Stella and Marcel Duchamp, painting bust portrait of Man Ray above Duchamp), gelatin silver print, 20.7 x 15.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art, New York Joseph Stella, 1919–20, Brooklyn Bridge, oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, Yale University Art Gallery Having met Umberto Boccioni and befriended Gino Severini in Europe, he became associated with the Italian Futurists and began to incorporate Futurist principles into his art, though he was also interested in the structural experiments of the Cubists and the dynamic color of the Fauves.Haskell, p. 88. Returning to New York in 1913, he was prepared to give the United States a second try. It was a decision he did not regret, although, as art historian Wanda Corn noted, \\"his culture shock never abated.\\"Corn, p. 135. He became a part of the Alfred Stieglitz and the Walter Arensberg circles in Manhattan and enjoyed close relationships with fellow expatriates Albert Gleizes and leader of the New York Dada movement Marcel Duchamp (Stella and Arensberg accompanied Duchamp to the plumbing supply store in 1917 to purchase the infamous urinal.Calvin Tomkins, Marcel Duchamp: A Biography (New York: Henry Holt, 1996), p. 181.). As a result of these associations, he had almost as many opportunities as he had known in Europe to be among kindred spirits and to see advanced new art. In 1913–14, he painted Battle of Lights, Coney Island, one of the earliest and greatest American Futurist works. The legendary Armory Show of 1913, in which he participated, provided him with greater impetus to experiment with modernist styles. Der Rosenkavalier (1914) and Spring (The Procession – A Chromatic Sensation) (1914–16) are vigorous color abstractions. With the Armory Show, Stella also became a much-talked-about figure in the New York art world, an object of virulent attacks from conservative critics who found Modernism threatening and inexplicable and an object of fascination to younger, more adventurous artists. In the view of art historian Sam Hunter, \\"Among the modern paintings at the Armory Show, Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, Picabia's Procession at Seville, and Stella's Futurist Battle of Lights, Coney Island came to exert the most seminal influence on American painters.\\"Hunter, p. 85. A friend noted that the painting \\"caused a general sensation, an artistic upheaval as sudden and unexpected as it was universal [in avant-garde circles].\\"Jaffe, p. 47. Collector and art educator Katherine Dreier included Stella among those artists whose work she sought to promote under the auspices of her Societe Anonyme, New York's first museum dedicated exclusively to advanced contemporary art, which opened its doors in 1920. In New York during the 1920s, Stella became fascinated with the geometric quality of the architecture of Lower Manhattan. In these works he further assimilated elements of Cubism and Futurism. In Brooklyn Bridge (1919–20), he shows his fascination with the sweeping lines of the Roeblings' bridge, a motif he used several years before poet Hart Crane turned to this structure as a symbol of modernity. Stella's depictions of the bridge feature the diagonal cables that sweep downward forcefully, providing directional energy. While these dynamic renderings suggest the excitement and motion of modern life, in Stella's hands, the image of the bridge also becomes a powerful icon of stability and solidarity. Among his other well-known paintings is New York Interpreted (The Voice of the City) (1922), a five-paneled work (almost twenty-three feet long and over eight feet high) patterned after a religious altarpiece, but depicting bridges and skyscrapers instead of saints. This work reflects the belief, common at the time, that industry was displacing religion as the center of modern life. The painting is in the collection of the Newark Museum. \\"At a time when virtually all modernists tried their hand at representing the city,\\" Wanda Corn has written, \\"Stella's painting is the summa.\\"Corn, 137. (Corn's chapter on Joseph Stella in The Great American Thing contains an extended treatment of this painting, as does Jaffe's biography, pp. 64–80.) In the 1930s, Stella worked on the Federal Art Project and later traveled to Europe, North Africa, and the West Indies, locations that inspired him to work in various modes. He restlessly moved from one style to the next, from realism to abstraction to surrealism. He executed abstract city themes, religious images, botanical and nature studies, erotic and steamy Caribbean landscapes, and colorful still lifes of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Stella's works from his post-Armory Show period, however, were problematic for the cultivation of a sustained career. Once he had ceased painting in a Futurist or quasi-Cubist mode and had finished with his period of Precisionist factory images (circa 1920), he was not aligned with any particular movement. His concerns, as well as his approach to painting, became less timely, more personal and idiosyncratic. Tree of My Life (1919), like many later Stella works, is \\"baroque and operatic,\\"Haskell, p. 110. a garden scene out of Bosch, and his figure studies (usually female, often Madonna-like) are decoratively, extravagantly embellished. His numerous floral works border on the surreal but, in their lushness and excess, could not accurately be characterized as a part of the Surrealist movement. Critic Lewis Mumford called him a \\"puzzling painter\\" at that point, commenting, \\"I have seen the fissure between his realism and his fantasy widen into an abyss.\\"Haskell, p. 170. Stella's strong draftsmanship is evident in the many different kinds of images he created throughout his life. He is especially respected today for his portraits on paper drawn in silverpoint, or silverpoint and oil, most from the 1920s. His renderings of Walt Whitman, Marcel Duchamp, the artist Louis Eilshemius, and his friend, the composer Edgar Varese, are works of exceptional sensitivity to line, facial detail, and the intellectual aura of the sitter. A lesser-known aspect of Stella's work is the collages he made in the 1920s, consisting of scraps of discarded paper, wrappers (some with the commercial logo or label still visible), and other bits of urban debris, often slashed with brush strokes of paint. Though Stella was \\"attracted to the grandiose, mechanized aspects of the city, [he] was also drawn to its anonymous, unnoticed discards...the detritus of human existence.\\"Davidson, pp. 101–102. These are works in the spirit of the German collage artist Kurt Schwitters and the anti-\\"high art\\" ethos of the Dada movement, which always interested Stella. By the late 1930s, Stella's work attracted considerably less attention than it had in previous decades. His truculent personality had alienated many old friends, and his style no longer spoke to the times.Haskell, p. 162. \\"Stella's health and critical fortunes sank in [the years prior to World War II]. Emotionally cut off from the New York art world, even his retrospective at the Newark Museum in 1939 failed to reestablish him. Though successful as a presentation, the show was less enthusiastically reviewed than Stella had anticipated, and he later complained of not being able to induce anyone living in New York City to see it.\\"Haskell, p. 176. Diagnosed with heart disease in the early 1940s and subject to increasing periods of morbid anxiety, he succumbed to heart failure in 1946. He is interred in a mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. ==Major works in public collections== * Pittsburg Factory Scene (1908–1918): Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis * Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras (1913–14): Yale University Art Gallery * Battle of Lights, Coney Island (1913–14): Sheldon Museum of Art, University of Nebraska–Lincoln * Der Rosenkavalier (1914): Whitney Museum of American Art * Pyrotechnic Fires (1919): Museum of Fine Arts Houston * Brooklyn Bridge (1919–20): Yale University Art Gallery * New York Interpreted (The Voice of the City) (1920–22): Newark Museum * Factories (1920): Museum of Modern Art * By-Product Plants (1923–26): Chicago Art Institute * The Amazon (1925–26): Baltimore Museum of Art * The Virgin (1926): Brooklyn Museum * Tree, Cactus, Moon (1927–28): Reynolda House Museum, North Carolina * American Landscape (1929): Walker Art Center * Lotus (1929): Hirshhorn Museum * Flowers, Italy (1930): Phoenix Art Museum * Smoke Stacks (1935): Indiana State University Art Collection * Old Brooklyn Bridge (1941): Museum of Fine Arts, Boston ==Art market== On 13 November 2018 a painting by Stella titled Tree of My Life (1919) sold at Christie's New York for US$5,937,500; a world record for a work by Stella at public auction.Joseph Stella, 1919, Tree of My Life, oil on canvas, 213.4 x 193 cm, Christie's New York, An American Place, The Barney A.

O'Malley is a member of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, commonly known as the Capuchins. O'Malley was elevated to the cardinalate in 2006. He was considered a papabile contender to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned on February 28, 2013, until Pope Francis was chosen on March 13, 2013. On April 13, 2013, Francis appointed O'Malley as one of eight cardinals of the Council of Cardinal Advisers to help the Pope govern the Catholic Church and reform its central administration.Pope Francis Forms 8-Cardinal Advisory Board to Reform Catholic Church Anugrah Kumar.

Both parents were of Irish descent. O'Malley, his sister, and his older brother grew up in South Hills of Pittsburgh, and Reading, Pennsylvania. At age 12, he entered St. Fidelis Minor Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania, a boarding school for students who were considering joining the Franciscan order. While there, in addition to studying the normal high school subjects, he also studied Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, German, and Hebrew, while also being active in theatre. After graduating from St. Fidelis, he attended Capuchin College in Washington, DC, and the Catholic University of America, where he is now a member of the Board of Trustees. On July 14, 1965, at the age of 21, O'Malley professed his vows in the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and took the name Seán in honor of St. John the Apostle. After he was ordained a deacon, he spent a brief period in Easter Island, Chile. He was ordained a priest on August 29, 1970, at age 26, by Bishop John Bernard McDowell, an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. After ordination he graduated from The Catholic University of America with a master's degree in religious education and a Ph.D. in Spanish and Portuguese literature. ===Professor and pastor=== O'Malley served as a professor at The Catholic University from 1969 to 1973. In 1973, he was asked to minister to Latinos living in the Washington, DC, area at the Spanish Catholic Center. The Center was founded in 1967 by the Archdiocese of Washington, and it was originally headed by Spanish missionaries Fr. Rutílio and Sister Ana María. It is an organization which provided educational, medical and legal help to immigrants. He opened a Spanish bookstore and founded El Pregonero, the first Spanish newspaper in the DC area. In 1978, Cardinal William Wakefield Baum appointed him episcopal vicar for the Portuguese, Hispanic, and Haitian communities, and he became the executive director of the archdiocesan Office of Social Ministry. He was also named knight commander of the Order of Infante D. Henrique by Portugal in 1985 for his service to the Portuguese people. He says his daily prayers in Spanish. ===Bishop of Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands=== O'Malley was appointed coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Saint Thomas on May 30, 1984, by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 2 by Bishop Edward John Harper, with Archbishop James Hickey and Bishop Eugene Marino serving as co-consecrators. He served as coadjutor for one year and then succeeded Harper as Bishop of Saint Thomas on October 16, 1985, upon Harper's resignation. While in the Virgin Islands, he worked with the homeless and opened a home for people with AIDS. He was made an honorary chaplain of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1991. ===Bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts=== On June 16, 1992, O'Malley was chosen to head the Diocese of Fall River. He was installed on August 11, 1992. As Bishop, O'Malley first attempted to settle the sexual abuse scandal in the Fall River diocese. ===Bishop of Palm Beach, Florida=== In the Palm Beach diocese (2002-2003), Bishop O'Malley also tried to overcome the abuse scandal there. He also worked closely with the Portuguese and Hispanic population, which make up a large percentage of the Catholics in the United States. In 1998 John Paul II appointed O'Malley to the Special Assembly for Oceania of the Synod of Bishops. ===Archbishop of Boston=== O'Malley speaks to students at St. Paul's Catholic Church, home to the Catholic community at Harvard University, in 2006 Known as a fixer in various Roman Catholic dioceses plagued by sexual abuse scandals, he became the Archbishop of Boston in 2003, succeeding Cardinal Bernard Law who had resigned as a consequence of the sexual abuse scandal there. On July 3, 2019, the Archdiocese released a statement revealing that O'Malley had agreed to accept Pope Francis' request to stay on as Archbishop of Boston \\"for a few more years,\\" despite the fact that O'Malley, as required, submitted his letter of resignation upon turning 75 years of age.July 3, 2019 - Statement Of The Roman Catholic Archdiocese Of Boston Archdiocese of Boston, accessed April 24, 2020 Archdiocese spokesperson Terry Donilon said O'Malley was \\"really relieved\\" about the Vatican's decision and that \\"He loves being the archbishop of Boston and so we're pleased that that was settled right out of the box.\\" The Archdiocese statement also claimed that \\"The Cardinal is pleased to have the continued confidence of the Holy Father and looks forward to continuing to serve the people of God in Boston and in support of the Pope’s ministry in leading the universal church.\\" Cardinal Cardinal O'Malley in 2014 Pope Benedict XVI elevated O'Malley to the rank of Cardinal-Priest in the consistory of March 24, 2006. O'Malley was assigned the titular church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome. The following May, O'Malley was named as a member of both the Congregation for the Clergy and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the Roman Curia. In late September 2009, he became a member of the Presidential Council of the Pontifical Council for the Family, on the same day as an American couple and a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, were named as consultors. On September 19, 2006, O'Malley became the first cardinal with a personal blog. As of Christmas 2006 he began offering a regular podcast as well. He views the podcasts as \\"yet another tool [he] can use to reach the young people in our Church who more and more are turning to the Internet for their information.\\" O'Malley participated in the 2013 papal conclave, which elected Pope Francis, and is eligible to participate in future papal conclaves that are held before his 80th birthday on June 29, 2024. As of September 2011, O'Malley is the only Capuchin member of the College of Cardinals.January 18, 2007; Cardinali appartenenti ad Istituti di vita consacrata o Società di vita apostolica (Italian); Holy See Press Office; url accessed February 3, 2007 On April 13, 2013, he was appointed to a group of eight cardinals established by Pope Francis exactly a month after his election, to advise him and to study a plan for revising the Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia, Pastor bonus. The group's first meeting was scheduled for October 1–3, 2013. The Pope was already in contact with the members of this group. Along with former Washington, DC, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, O'Malley accompanied Francis to Cuba on September 20, 2015. O'Malley praised the new tone of Francis' papacy. He stated however that those that expected change in doctrine from the pope on sexual ethics like abortion, contraception, and gay marriage would be disappointed. He also indicated that the church would not alter the ban on Communion for the divorced remarried and that he saw no theological justification for doing so. On January 14, 2017, Pope Francis named O'Malley a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for a five-year renewable term. On 15 October 2020, he renewed O'Malley's term on the Council of Cardinal Advisers. ===Apostolic Visitor to Dublin=== In June 2010, after the Ryan Report and Murphy Report on the abuses by the Church in Ireland, O'Malley was named along with others to oversee the apostolic visitation of certain dioceses and seminaries in Ireland. O'Malley was named as the Visitor to the Archdiocese of Dublin and its suffragan sees, Ferns and Ossory and Kildare and Leighlin. He would report back to the Holy See on what steps had been taken since the reports were issued, and what else needs to happen.Cullen, Kevin, \\"US visitor well versed in church abuse issue\\", The Irish Times, Friday, June 4, 2010 ==Views== ===Abortion politics=== In November 2007, O'Malley said that the Democratic Party has been persistently hostile to pro-life groups and that the fact many Catholic voters support Democratic candidates \\"borders on scandal.\\" In a November 2008 interview he said that, unless the Church formally excommunicated them, he would not deny Communion to Catholic politicians in his diocese who support legal abortion. Despite criticism from conservative Catholics, including Raymond Arroyo of Eternal Word Television Network, of his participation in the funeral service for Senator Ted Kennedy, a long-standing supporter of legal abortion, O'Malley assisted at the funeral Mass and led a prayer. He called for less contentious political dialog: \\"We will not change hearts by turning away from people in their time of need and when they are experiencing grief and loss.\\" He said he appreciated the Senator's work for social justice, but that \\"there is a tragic sense of lost opportunity in his lack of support for the unborn\\". ===Leadership Conference of Women Religious=== On October 1, 2009, O'Malley wrote a letter on behalf of the Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), then under investigation by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, praising a traveling exhibition that documented the work of women religious in the United States. He wrote that \\"the Church is grateful for all that your communities have done and continue to do to advance the mission of the Church, especially in the areas of health care, education, social services, and pastoral ministry, as are highlighted in the exhibit\\". ===Sexual abuse policies=== O'Malley has settled 101 abuse claims and has initiated a zero tolerance policy against sexual abuse. He also instituted one of the first comprehensive sexual abuse policies in the Roman Catholic Church. On December 5, 2013, O'Malley announced a pontifically approved commission, the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors whose purpose is to prevent clerical sexual abuse and to help victims. When the Commission was established on March 22, 2014, O'Malley was named as its first head. In 2015, he supported the film Spotlight, which took an in-depth look at the wrongdoings of the Catholic Church in light of sexual abuse scandals. Theodore McCarrick and St. John's Seminary controversies O'Malley's stance towards handling sex abuse came under question in July 2018, when it was revealed that the cardinal neglected a letter which Boniface Ramsey, a New York priest, sent to him on June 17, 2015, concerning sex abuse committed by Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2018/08/14/abuse-letter-to- cardinal-omalley-was-second-priest-sent-officials-about-mccarrick/ Despite being required to enforce a zero-tolerance policy with regards to reporting sex abuse, O'Malley said the letter was handled by staff and was never forwarded to him. Ramsey stated that he had reported the allegations against McCarrick to other Catholic officials before he sent his letter to O'Malley. During the time the letter was sent, McCarrick and O'Malley were both working with Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega to mend the long-strained relations between the United States and Cuba. McCarrick also accepted O'Malley's invitation to appear at the Archdiocese of Boston's \\"Celebration of the Priesthood\\" fundraising dinner which took place in South Boston in September 2015. On August 10, 2018, allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in the Archdiocese of Boston's St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Massachusetts. On August 15, 2018, it was announced that O'Malley would not attend the World Meeting of Families held in Dublin, Ireland between August 21 and August 26 in order to review these allegations. ===Caritas Christi controversy=== In 2009, Caritas Christi Health Care, which the Archdiocese of Boston owned, proposed contracting with Centene Corporation, a Missouri-based health insurer, to provide certain healthcare services, including abortion and pregnancy termination services, through a jointly-owned venture named Celticare. The new director of Caritas, Ralph de la Torre, announced the project as part of an effort to relieve the hospital system's financial problems while extending services to low income and underserved populations. In order for Caritas to participate in the Massachusetts state program CommonwealthCare, Caritas needed to provide access to mandated services, including some forbidden by Catholic teaching. Torre explained: O'Malley asked the National Catholic Bioethical Center to review the contractual relationship, which theologians in a survey conducted by The Boston Globe in March had unanimously supported on the grounds that Catholic hospitals would not participate directly in providing abortion and the arrangement would allow Caritas to deliver much- needed services to the poor. The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts criticized the arrangement: \\"With Caritas Christi now thoroughly embedded in the culture of death, we are now facing the end, in Massachusetts at least, of Catholic medical resistance to abortion and contraception. This tragic state of affairs is the personal responsibility of the Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean O'Malley.\\" In June 2009, Caritas Christi, at O'Malley's insistence, terminated its partial ownership of Celticare. O'Malley said: Pro- life activist groups varied in their responses. Some praised O'Malley's decision, but others continued to object that Caritas, as a participant in CommonwealthCare, is still required, even as it refuses to provide abortions, to engage in abortion referrals. ===Catholic Charities and gay adoption=== Massachusetts has included sexual orientation in its anti-discrimination statute since 1989, and it legalized same-sex marriage beginning May 17, 2004. Between about 1985 and 1995, Catholic Charities of Boston, which accepted state funds in support of its adoption services program, placed 13 children with gay couples out of 720 adoptions. Catholic Charities President J. Bryan Hehir explained the practice: \\"If we could design the system ourselves, we would not participate in adoptions to gay couples, but we can't. We have to balance various goods.\\", also available here In December 2005, the lay- dominated board of Catholic Charities of Boston voted unanimously to continue gay adoptions. On March 10, 2006, after unsuccessfully seeking help from Governor Mitt Romney in obtaining an exemption from the state's anti- discrimination statute, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexual couples. Hehir said \\"This is a difficult and sad day for Catholic Charities. We have been doing adoptions for more than 100 years.\\"Boston Globe: Patricia Wen, \\"Catholic Charities stuns state, ends adoptions,\\" March 3, 2006, accessed February 24, 2012, also available here ==Honours== *80px Commander of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (7 February 1985) *80px Grand-Cross of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (28 June 2016) ==Bibliography== * EAN 560-3658113471 ==See also== * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops ==References== ==External links== * *Cardinal Seán's blog *Boston Archdiocese page for Archbishop Seán O'Malley * *Photographs of Archbishop O'Malley at March 19, 2005 Boston Men's Conference * *Catholic Pages *Biography of Archbishop O'Malley *Examination of the ring of O'Malley with pictures Category:1944 births Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:American Roman Catholic clergy of Irish descent Category:American bloggers Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American cardinals Category:American Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Saint Thomas Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Palm Beach Category:Capuchins Category:Members of the Congregation for the Clergy Category:Members of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life Category:Living people Category:Catholic University of America alumni Category:People from Lakewood, Ohio Category:Cardinals created by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Members of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors Category:Roman Catholic Archbishops of Boston Category:Religious leaders from Massachusetts Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:Catholic University of America faculty Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Fall River Category:Capuchin College alumni Category:Catholics from Ohio Category:American male bloggers Category:Capuchin cardinals ","title":"Seán Patrick O'Malley"},{"id":"1438739","text":"Esashi is the name of two towns in Hokkaidō. *Esashi, Hokkaidō (Sōya) (枝幸町) in Sōya Subprefecture * Esashi, Hokkaidō (Hiyama) (江差町) in Hiyama Subprefecture ","title":"Esashi, Hokkaidō"},{"id":"1438740","text":"Echium vulgare — known as viper's bugloss and blueweedDickinson, T.; Metsger, D.; Bull, J.; & Dickinson, R.

IR absorption spectrum of copper(I) chloride Copper(I) chloride, commonly called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance is a white solid sparingly soluble in water, but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Impure samples appear green due to the presence of copper(II) chloride (CuCl2).Pastor, Antonio C. (1986) \\"Method of preparing cupric ion free cuprous chloride\\" Section 2, lines 4–41. Image:Copper(I)chloride crystal 01.jpg File:Copper(I) chloride.jpg ==History== Copper(I) chloride was first prepared by Robert Boyle in the mid-seventeenth century from mercury(II) chloride (\\"Venetian sublimate\\") and copper metal: :HgCl2 \\\\+ 2 Cu → 2 CuCl + Hg In 1799, J.L. Proust characterized the two different chlorides of copper. He prepared CuCl by heating CuCl2 at red heat in the absence of air, causing it to lose half of its combined chlorine followed by removing residual CuCl2 by washing with water. An acidic solution of CuCl was formerly used for analysis of carbon monoxide content in gases, for example in Hempel's gas apparatus. This application was significant during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when coal gas was widely used for heating and lighting. ==Synthesis== Copper(I) chloride is produced industrially by the direct combination of copper metal and chlorine at 450–900 °C: :2 Cu + Cl2 -> 2 CuCl Copper(I) chloride can also be prepared by reducing copper(II) chloride with sulfur dioxide, or with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) that acts as a reducing sugar: :2 CuCl2 + SO2 + 2 H2O -> 2 CuCl + H2SO4 + 2 HCl :2 CuCl2 + C6H8O6 -> 2CuCl + 2HCl + C6H6O6 Many other reducing agents can be used. ==Properties== Copper(I) chloride has the cubic zincblende crystal structure at ambient conditions. Upon heating to 408 °C the structure changes to hexagonal. Several other crystalline forms of CuCl appear at high pressures (several GPa). Copper(I) chloride is a Lewis acid, which is classified as soft according to the Hard-Soft Acid-Base concept. Thus, it forms a series of complexes with soft Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine: : CuCl + 1 P(C6H5)3 → 1/4 {CuCl[P(C6H5)3]}4 : CuCl + 2 P(C6H5)3 → CuCl[P(C6H5)3)]2 : CuCl + 3 P(C6H5)3 → CuCl[P(C6H5)3)]3 Although CuCl is insoluble in water, it dissolves in aqueous solutions containing suitable donor molecules. It forms complexes with halide ions, for example forming H3O+ CuCl2− in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Chloride is displaced by CN− and S2O32−. Solutions of CuCl in HCl or NH3 absorb carbon monoxide to form colourless complexes such as the chloride- bridged dimer [CuCl(CO)]2. The same hydrochloric acid solutions also react with acetylene gas to form [CuCl(C2H2)]. Ammoniacal solutions of CuCl react with acetylenes to form the explosive copper(I) acetylide, Cu2C2. Alkene complexes o can be prepared by reduction of CuCl2 by sulfur dioxide in the presence of the alkene in alcohol solution. Complexes with dienes such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene are particularly stable:Nicholls, D. (1973) Complexes and First-Row Transition Elements, Macmillan Press, London. Structure of COD complex of CuCl In absence of other ligands, its aqueous solutions are unstable with respect to disproportionation: : 2 CuCl → Cu + CuCl2 In part for this reason samples in air assume a green coloration. ==Uses== The main use of copper(I) chloride is as a precursor to the fungicide copper oxychloride. For this purpose aqueous copper(I) chloride is generated by comproportionation and then air-oxidized: : Cu + CuCl2 → 2 CuCl : 4 CuCl + O2 \\\\+ 2 H2O → Cu3Cl2(OH)4 \\\\+ CuCl2 Copper(I) chloride catalyzes a variety of organic reactions, as discussed above. Its affinity for carbon monoxide in the presence of aluminium chloride is exploited in the COPureSM process. ===In organic synthesis=== CuCl is used with carbon monoxide, aluminium chloride, and hydrogen chloride in the Gatterman-Koch reaction to form benzaldehydes. In the Sandmeyer reaction.Wade, L. G. (2003) Organic Chemistry, 5th ed., Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 871. .March, J. (1992) Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, New York. p. 723. Treatment of an arenediazonium salt with CuCl leads to an aryl chloride, for example: (Example Sandmeyer reaction using CuCl) The reaction has wide scope and usually gives good yields. Early investigators observed that copper(I) halides catalyse 1,4-addition of Grignard reagents to alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones led to the development of organocuprate reagents that are widely used today in organic synthesis:Jasrzebski, J. T. B. H.; van Koten, G. (2002) Modern Organocopper Chemistry, N. Krause (ed.). Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany. p. 1. . (Addition of RMgX to C=C-C=O mediated by CuCl) This finding led to the development of organocopper chemistry. For example, CuCl reacts with methyllithium (CH3Li) to form \\"Gilman reagents\\" such as (CH3)2CuLi, which find extensive use in organic synthesis. Grignard reagents form similar organocopper compounds. Although other copper(I) compounds such as copper(I) iodide are now more often used for these types of reactions, copper(I) chloride is still recommended in some cases:Bertz, S. H.; Fairchild, E. H. (1999) Handbook of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volume 1: Reagents, Auxiliaries and Catalysts for C-C Bond Formation, R. M. Coates, S. E. Denmark (eds.). Wiley, New York. pp. 220–3. . (Alkylation of sorbate ester at 4-position mediated by CuCl) Here, Bu indicates an n-butyl group. Without CuCl, the Grignard reagent alone gives a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-addition products (i.e., the butyl adds at the C closer to the C=O). Copper(I) chloride is also an intermediate formed from copper(II) chloride in the Wacker process. ===In polymer chemistry=== CuCl is used as a catalyst in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP). ==Niche Uses== Copper(I) chloride is also used in pyrotechnics as a blue/green coloring agent. In a flame test, copper chlorides, like all copper compounds, emit green-blue. ==References== ==External links== *National Pollutant Inventory – Copper and compounds fact sheet *The COPureSM Process for purifying CO utilizing a copper chloride complex Category:Chlorides Category:Copper(I) compounds Category:Metal halides Category:Coordination compounds Category:Pyrotechnic colorants ","title":"Copper(I) chloride"},{"id":"1438744","text":"Claydon (meaning 'Clay Hill') is a place name in: ==England== * Claydon, Oxfordshire * Claydon, Suffolk * Claydon (deanery), Buckinghamshire * Claydon House, Buckinghamshire, originally home of the Verney family (relatives of Florence Nightingale) and now in the care of the National Trust * Botolph Claydon, Buckinghamshire * East Claydon, Buckinghamshire * Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire * Steeple Claydon, Buckinghamshire * Claydon with Clattercot, civil parish in Oxfordshire * Claydon railway station (Buckinghamshire) * Claydon railway station (Suffolk) ==Other== * Claydon, Saskatchewan, Canada * Claydon Peak, Antarctica * Mitch Claydon, Australian-English cricketer ==Related== *Claydon Map of the course of the river beside Claydon House ==See also== *Clayton (disambiguation) ","title":"Claydon"},{"id":"1438748","text":"{ border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1em; margin- bottom: 1em; font-size: small; border-collapse: 0; float: right;\\" width=\\"343\\" class=\\"toccolours\\" +  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"font-size:larger;text- align:center;background-color:#333;color:#eee\\"  Peresopnytsya Gospels -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  List of illuminated manuscripts -  style=\\"text- align:right\\"  Title:  Peresopnytsya Gospels -  style=\\"text-align:right\\"  Date created:  1556-1561 -  style=\\"text-align:right\\"  Size:  482 fol.

The Peresopnytsia Gospels (, Peresopnytske Yevanheliie), dating from the 16th century, is one of the most intricate surviving East Slavic manuscripts. It was made between 15 August 1556 and 29 August 1561, at the Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Iziaslav, and the Monastery of the Mother of God in Peresopnytsia, Volyn'. The scribe was Mykhailo Vasyl’ovych, son of an archpriest from Sianik, who worked under the direction of Hryhorii, the archimandrite of the Peresopnytsia Monastery. The manuscript is a Gospel Book containing only the four Gospels of the New Testament, and is ornamented with Glagolitic characters, which were influenced by the Italian Renaissance style. This is the first known example of a vernacular Old Ukrainian translation of the canonical text of the Scriptures. The Peresopnytsya Gospels are the most well-known translations of canonical texts into the Old Ukrainian language. Luxuriously decorated under the influence of the Italian Renaissance, the work also shows characteristic Ukrainian decorations, and a high artistic level in the miniatures of the Ukrainian icon-painting school connected with Byzantine and Eastern Slavonic traditions. The Peresopnytsya Gospels were commissioned by Princess Nastacia Yuriyivna Zheslavska-Holshanska (Zaslavska-Olshanska) of Volyn, and her daughter and her son-in-law (Yevdokiya and Ivan Fedorovych Czartoryski). After its completion the book was kept in the Peresopnytsya Monastery. On 17 April 1701 it was presented to Pereyaslav Cathedral by Ivan Mazepa the Hetman of Ukraine. Scholar Osip Bodyansky discovered the book at the Pereyaslav Seminary and published a paper on the subject. Later on it was held in the Poltava Seminary, Poltava Museum of History and Regional Studies, Kyiv Pechersk Lavra preserve. On 24 December 1948 this treasure of Ukrainian culture was placed at the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine. All six Ukrainian Presidents since 1991 have taken the oath of office on the Gospels: Leonid Kravchuk (1991), Leonid Kuchma (1994), Viktor Yushchenko (2005), Viktor Yanukovych (2010), Petro Poroshenko (2014), Volodymyr Zelensky (2019). ==See also== * Bible translations into Ukrainian ==References== ==External links== * Peresopnytsia Gospel at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine * Information on the Peresopnytsia Gospel from UNESCO * Role of the Gospel in Ukrainian inaugurations * Peresopnytsya Gospel Treasure of the National Library of Ukraine, displayed via The European Library * Copy of Peresopnytsia Gospel Passed to Vatican * Information on a Peresopnytsia Gospel commemorative stamp Category:East Slavic manuscripts Category:Gospel Books Category:Ukrainian culture Category:16th-century biblical manuscripts Category:History of Christianity in Ukraine Category:16th-century illuminated manuscripts Category:National symbols of Ukraine Category:Ukrainian presidential inaugurations Category:Bible translations into Ukrainian Category:Cyrillic manuscripts ","title":"Peresopnytsia Gospel"},{"id":"1438751","text":"Hypargos or Hypargus may refer to: *Pseudodrephalys hypargus, a butterfly species *Hypargos (bird), a genus of birds in the family Estrildidae ","title":"Hypargus"},{"id":"1438756","text":"The Junction Boys were the \\"survivors\\" of Texas A&M; Aggies football coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant's 10-day summer camp in Junction, Texas, beginning September 1, 1954. The ordeal has achieved legendary status and became the subject of a 2001 book The Junction BoysTwelve Mighty Orphans: The Inspiring True Story of the Mighty Mites who ..., Google Books, retrieved 2008-04-10 by Jim Dent and a television movie with the same title produced by ESPN that starred Tom Berenger as Bryant. ==The camp== Texas A&M; University hired Bear Bryant as head football coach in 1954, replacing former coach Ray George. Bryant arrived in College Station on February 8, 1954, and began cleaning house. He felt that many of the players on the team were weak and not properly trained or coached. He decided that his players needed a camp away from the distractions on campus; thus, he arranged for the camp to be held in the small Hill Country town of Junction, where Texas A&M; had a 411-acre (1.7-km2) adjunct campus (now the Texas Tech University Center at Junction). At the time of the camp, the Hill Country was experiencing an epic heat wave. It was also in the midst of the worst drought in the recorded history of the region, which had already lasted four years and would last another two after the camp was over. According to the National Climatic Data Center, all 10 days of the camp took place in high temperatures, with a few days topping 100°F (38°C). Practices began before dawn and usually lasted all day with meetings in the evening until 11:00 pm. The oppressive heat, combined with the brutal practice schedule, was too much for many of the players. Each day, fewer and fewer players would be at practice, as many players quit the team from illness or disgust. The situation was compounded by Bryant's refusal to allow water breaks. This practice, which is now widely recognized as dangerous, was at the time commonly employed by coaches at all levels in an attempt to \\"toughen up\\" their players. The only relief provided the players were two towels soaked in cold water; one towel was to be shared by the offensive players, and one by the defense. One of the Junction Boys, future NFL coach Jack Pardee, would later say in an interview that it was not unheard of for players to sweat away 10% of their body weight. ==List of \\"survivors\\"== By the end of the 10-day camp, only a fraction of those who started were left. The list of \\"survivors\\" varies from 27 to 38.

In fact, a smaller number actually went to the camp. Although Bryant started out with over 100 players on the roster, many had already quit or been cut by the time of the Junction camp. Accounts of the exact number who left for Junction vary, but all the survivors insist that it was less than 100. In 1954, Richard Vick had his photograph taken with Bryant. The photo was featured on the cover of the Houston Chronicle. Today, the photo of Vick and Bryant, as well as Vick's uniform, can be seen at the Texas A&M; Sports Museum at Kyle Field. In 2008, 19 of the Junction Boys had a 54th anniversary reunion at a ranch in Brenham, Texas. The remaining members have agreed to have a reunion every 5 years. In April 2010, the surviving Junction Boys were honored by the Texas Children's Cancer Center at \\"An Evening with Texas Legends\\" in Houston, Texas, at the Hilton Americas Hotel. They were interviewed by sportswriter Mickey Herskowitz at the event. ==Impact== Although the \\"survivors\\", as they came to be called, were mentally tougher after the experience, this new strength did not translate into immediate success on the field. In 1954, Texas A&M; won only one game against nine losses (1-9-0 record), the only losing season in Bryant's 38 years as a head coach. In 1956, however, and in spite of a postseason ban, the team finished 9-0-1, punctuated with a win against rival Texas and an end to their Southwest Conference championship drought. ==1954 schedule and results== *vs. Texas Tech lost 9-41 *vs. Oklahoma State lost 6-14 *at Georgia won 6-0 *at Houston lost 7-10 *vs. TCU lost 20-21 *at Baylor lost 7-20 *vs. Arkansas lost 7-14 *at SMU lost 3-6 *vs. Rice lost 19-29 *at Texas lost 13-22 In 1955, Texas A&M; went 7-2-1, and in 1956, the team went 9-0-1 and won the Southwest Conference. Two of the Junction Boys, Jack Pardee and Gene Stallings, went on to become head coaches in the NFL. Pardee was a two-time All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams (1963) and the Washington Redskins (1971). Stallings also became Texas A&M; head coach, and his Aggie team beat Bryant's Alabama team in the 1968 Cotton Bowl. He later took over Bryant's Crimson Tide and won a national championship in 1992 - Alabama's first national championship since Bryant's death. ==References== Category:Texas A&M; Aggies football players Category:Nicknamed groups of American football players https://www.freemancitronelle.com/notices/Joseph- Rowell https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/A-amp-M-football- experience-shaped-Brown-2231808.php ","title":"Junction Boys"},{"id":"1438760","text":"Patrick Collison (born 9 September 1988) is an Irish billionaire entrepreneur. He is the co-founder and CEO of Stripe, which he started with his younger brother, John, in 2010. He won the 41st Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in 2005 at the age of sixteen. Collison lives in San Francisco, California. The brothers were worth at least $3.2 billion each after Stripe raised $150 million from CapitalG, an investment division of Google parent's company Alphabet, and General Catalyst Partners. In September 2019, it was announced that Stripe had raised an addition $250 million at a valuation of $35 billion. Together, the brothers hold a controlling interest in Stripe and will be able to retain control should the company go public. ==Early life== Patrick Collison was born to Lily and Denis Collison in 1988. The eldest of three boys, he took his first computer course when he was eight years old at the University of Limerick and began learning computer programming at the age of ten. Collison was educated in Gaelscoil Aonach Urmhumhan, Nenagh, before attending Castletroy College in Castletroy, County Limerick. ==Career== ===Young Scientist=== Collison entered the 40th Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition with his project on artificial intelligence (nicknamed 'Isaac' after Isaac Newton, whom Patrick admired), finishing as individual runner-up. He re-entered the following year, and won first place at the age of sixteen on 14 January 2005. His project involved the creation of Croma, a LISP-type programming language. His prize of a €3,000 cheque and a trophy of Waterford Crystal was presented to him by President Mary McAleese. His younger brother Tommy participated with his project on blogging in the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in 2010. ===Auctomatic=== After attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a time, Collison dropped out. In 2007, he set up software company 'Shuppa' (a play on the Irish word 'siopa', meaning 'shop') in Limerick with his brother John Collison. Enterprise Ireland did not allocate funding to the company, prompting a move to California after Silicon Valley's Y Combinator showed interest, where they merged with two Oxford graduates, Harjeet and Kulveer Taggar, and the company became Auctomatic. On Good Friday of March 2008, Collison, aged nineteen, and his brother, aged seventeen, sold Auctomatic to Canadian company Live Current Media, becoming overnight millionaires. In May 2008 he became director of engineering at the company's new Vancouver base. Collison attributes the success of his company to his win in the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. ===Other=== Both Collison and his younger brother John were featured on a young Irish persons rich list aired on an RTÉ television show during the 2008 Christmas period. On 18 July 2009, at the age of 20 and following the publication of McCarthy Report, Collison outlined his ideas for the future of Ireland on popular talk- show Saturday Night with Miriam. In 2010, Patrick co-founded Stripe, which received backing from Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Sequoia Capital. In November 2016, the Collison brothers became the world's youngest self-made billionaires, worth at least $1.1 billion, after an investment in Stripe from CapitalG and General Catalyst Partners valued the company at $9.2 billion. According to Collison, he reads books and is interested in a broad range of subjects on history, technology, engineering, fiction, philosophy, and art. He publishes the list of books he read on his website. In November 2018, Collison published a piece in The Atlantic with Michael Nielsen entitled Science is Getting Less Bang for its Buck, arguing that increased investment in science hasn't produced commensurate output. In 2019, Collison published an opinion piece in the same outlet with Tyler Cowen arguing for a new academic discipline called \\"Progress Studies\\", which would study the cultural and institutional conditions which lead to the most progress and higher standards of living. In 2018, Stripe, under the direction of the Collison brothers, contributed $1 million to California YIMBY, a pro-housing development lobbying organization. The Collisons are citizens of Ireland. On June 29, 2020, Collison criticized the Chinese governments treatment of Uighurs tweeting: \\"As a US business (and tech) community, I think we should be significantly clearer about our horror at, and opposition to, the atrocities being committed by the Chinese government against its own people\\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Irish billionaires Category:Irish computer programmers Category:Irish scientists Category:People educated at Castletroy College Category:People from County Limerick Category:Y Combinator people Category:Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition Category:21st-century Irish people ","title":"Patrick Collison"},{"id":"1438764","text":"was a town located in Esashi District, Sōya Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

The mantle is all that is visible behind the head: the outer body wall and the fins are all part of the mantle. The brightly coloured mantle of a giant clam protects it from bright sunlight. The cuttlefish uses its mantle cavity for jet propulsion The mantle (also known by the Latin word pallium meaning mantle, robe or cloak, adjective pallial) is a significant part of the anatomy of molluscs: it is the dorsal body wall which covers the visceral mass and usually protrudes in the form of flaps well beyond the visceral mass itself. In many species of molluscs the epidermis of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and conchiolin, and creates a shell. In sea slugs there is a progressive loss of the shell and the mantle becomes the dorsal surface of the animal. The words mantle and pallium both originally meant cloak or cape, see mantle (vesture). This anatomical structure in molluscs often resembles a cloak because in many groups the edges of the mantle, usually referred to as the mantle margin, extend far beyond the main part of the body, forming flaps, double-layered structures which have been adapted for many different uses, including for example, the siphon. == Mantle cavity == The mantle cavity is a central feature of molluscan biology. This cavity is formed by the mantle skirt, a double fold of mantle which encloses a water space. This space contains the mollusc's gills, anus, osphradium, nephridiopores, and gonopores. The mantle cavity functions as a respiratory chamber in most molluscs. In bivalves it is usually part of the feeding structure. In some molluscs the mantle cavity is a brood chamber, and in cephalopods and some bivalves such as scallops, it is a locomotory organ. The mantle is highly muscular. In cephalopods the contraction of the mantle is used to force water through a tubular siphon, the hyponome, and this propels the animal very rapidly through the water. In gastropods it is used as a kind of \\"foot\\" for locomotion over the surface. In Patella the foot includes the entire ventral surface of the animal. The foot of the Bivalvia is a fleshy process adapted by its form to digging rather than to locomotion. == Formation of mollusc shell == In shelled molluscs, the mantle is the organ that forms the shell, and adds to the shell to increase its size and strength as the animal grows. Shell material is secreted by the ectodermic (epithelial) cells of the mantle tissue.\\"integument (molluscs).\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009.

In species where the shell is small compared to the size of the body, more of the mantle shows. Shell-less slugs have the mantle fully visible.

He married his wife Eda (née) Matiisen October 26, 1973. He was a member of the United Church, a golfer with a reputation for a formidable short game, and a hunter, especially of waterfowl.Canada Who's Who 2003 \\"Buzz\\" was a nickname he carried with him throughout his life since high school. ==Career== He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1957 and his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1959, both from the University of Alberta. After being admitted to the Alberta Bar, he became known as one of Canada's top criminal defence lawyers and in the 1970s was ranked amongst the top 10 in Canada by Weekend Magazine. He took silk and became Queen's Counsel in 1973, practicing with the firm of McClung Frohlich and Rand. In 1976, he was appointed to the District Court of Alberta, then to the Supreme Court of Alberta (trial division) in 1976, and was soon thereafter elevated to the Court of Appeal June 30, 1979. He held this position until he died.http://www.legalarchivessociety.ab.ca/Architypes/Architypes13_2.pdf He was an avid student and writer of history. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Heritage Room at the Edmonton Courthouse, a collection of artifacts and photographs of Alberta's legal history, including portraits of prominent Alberta judges and many of his own writings. After his death, the Alberta Court of Appeal renamed the room the J.W. (Buzz) McClung Heritage Room. He wrote often about legal history, including a book entitled Law West of the Bay in 1997. He also wrote a History of the Alberta Court of Appeal published by his fellow appellate justices after he died. He was also a friend and strong supporter of the Heritage Community Foundation. ==Notable Decisions and Controversy== ===Vriend v. Alberta=== McClung presided over the provincial appeal in Vriend v. Alberta, overturning the trial court's judgment in favour of Delwin Vriend, who had lost his job at a religious college because of his sexual orientation. In a manner uncharacteristic of its criticism of lower court decisions, however, The Supreme Court of Canada excoriated Justice McClung's reasoning for the kind of \\"neutral difference\\" approach argued unsuccessfully by the BC Government in its Eldridge decision. In the result, the Court embraced precisely what Justice McClung expressly rejected, and confirmed the trial judge's decision to \\"read in\\" to Alberta's Individual's Rights Protection Act sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination. ===R. v. Ewanchuk=== McClung later became a national figure with his \\"bonnet and crinolines\\" ruling in the sexual assault case of R. v. Ewanchuk. In his decision, he suggested that the teenage victim provoked her assailant by the way she dressed and the accused's actions were \\"far less criminal than hormonal\\" or that the victim could have stopped the assault with a \\"well-chosen expletive, a slap in the face or, if necessary, a well-directed knee.\\" The case was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court in 1999 in a decision written by fellow Alberta jurist, Justice Major; a concurring opinion by Quebec jurist, Justice L'Heureux-Dubé described his decision as perpetuating \\"archaic myths and stereotypes\\". In reply, McClung wrote a letter to the National Post attacking L'Heureux-Dubé, describing her writing as overly personal and blaming her attitude for the rise in the suicide rate of Quebec men. This letter drew even more furor when it was pointed out that L'Heureux-Dubé's husband had committed suicide in 1978. McClung apologized in another letter to the National Post, claiming that he was not aware of the situation.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/03/01/mcclunga990301.html ==References== Category:1935 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Judges in Alberta Category:Lawyers in Alberta Category:Members of the United Church of Canada Category:People from Edmonton Category:University of Alberta alumni ","title":"John McClung"},{"id":"1438804","text":"is a town in Okhotsk Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

He was the son of surgeon Henry Hampton Sr. and Julia Veva Hampton. Henry was raised on Laclede Station Rd. in Richmond Heights, Mo, a suburb adjacent to the western edge of the city of St. Louis. Henry lived on the eastern edge of an all black working class community. A native of Richmond Heights, Mo. Hampton would later move to Boston - to a large property at 88 Lambert Avenue in Roxbury where he founded his film production company Blackside, Inc., in 1968. It became one of the largest minority-owned non- theatrical film production companies in the U.S. during the mid-1970s and until his death in the late 1990s. Hampton and his company produced over 80 programs including documentaries, television spots, and other media productions. In 1965, while working for the Unitarian church as information director, Hampton went to Selma, Alabama, to participate in the Selma March. The event changed his life as he recognized the power of media and television and began to conceptualize a film documenting the Civil Rights Movement. Three years later, in 1968, he founded Blackside, Inc., which offered \\"special expertise in the design and production of film and audio-visual products aimed at minority audiences.\\"A Different Way of Communicating; A Blackside publicity booklet (1974), in the Henry Hamption Collection, Washington University Film & Media Archive Blackside's primary business between 1968 and 1979 was the production of films, television and radio spots, television programming, and audio-visual educational packages. Blackside also produced public service announcements and film-based training materials for government and commercial clients. Hampton made a commitment to social justice with later productions, including Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years (1954–1965); and Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965–mid 1980s; The Great Depression (1993); Malcolm X: Make It Plain (1994); America's War on Poverty (1995); Breakthrough: The Changing Face of Science in America (1997); I'll Make Me a World: A Century of African-American Arts (1999); Hopes on the Horizon: Africa in the 1990s (2001); This Far by Faith: African American Spiritual Journeys (2003). Hampton's film archive is held by the Washington University Film & Media Archive in St. Louis, Missouri. In addition to Hampton's films, the collection contains all of the elements that went into the production process such as interviews, stock footage, photographs, research, producer notes, scripts, and Hampton's personal papers. ==Education== Hampton attended Little Flower School in the Richmond Heights neighborhood of St. Louis. He later attended St. Louis University High School before studying literature at Washington University in St. Louis. He graduated from Washington University in 1961 and returned to deliver the commencement speech to the graduating Class of 1989.http://www.library.wustl.edu/units/spec/filmandmedia/collections/hampton/hampton_commencement.html Hampton attended medical school for a term at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, before dropping out. In 1977, the Harvard School of Design granted Hampton a Loeb Fellowship to study constitutional limitations and the nature of media and government information programs. His studies focused on consumers' and citizens' rights to information. He was the recipient of over 10 honorary degrees including an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from his alma mater (1989); St. Louis University (1988); Doctor of Arts, Northeastern University (1988); Suffolk University (1988); Bridgewater State College (1989); Brandeis University (1993); Boston College (1993); Emerson College (1995); Lincoln University (1996) and Tufts University (1996). ==Filmography== *America's War on Poverty (5-part series) *Boston Black United Front *Breakthrough: The Changing Face of Science in America (6-part series) *Code Blue *Crisis to Crisis: Voices of a Divided City *Easy Street *Eyes on the Prize (14-part series) **Eyes on the Prize I: America's Civil Rights Years 1954-1965 **Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965-1985 *The Great Depression (7-part series) *Head Start to Confidence *Hopes on the Horizon: Africa in the 1990s *I'll Make Me A World: A Century of African American Arts (6-part series) *In Search of Help: Welfare or Survivor's Benefits *Kinfolks *Malcolm X: Make It Plain *This Far By Faith: African American Spiritual Journeys (6-part series) *Reorganizing the Nation's Hospitals (1975) ==Awards== Hampton and Blackside won many major awards in television broadcasting.

A grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, Piëch started his career at Porsche, before leaving for Audi after an agreement that no member of the Porsche or Piëch families should be involved in the day-to-day operations of the Porsche company. Piëch eventually became the head of Audi, where he is credited with evolving and growing Audi into a competitor to equal Mercedes- Benz and BMW, thanks in part to innovative designs such as the Quattro and 100. In 1993, Piëch became the chairman and CEO of Volkswagen Group, which he is credited with turning into the large conglomerate it is today; He oversaw the purchase of Lamborghini and Bentley, as well as the founding of Bugatti Automobiles, all of which he integrated with the Volkswagen, Škoda, SEAT and Audi brands into a ladder-type structure similar to that used by Alfred Sloan at General Motors. Piëch was required to retire at age 65 per Volkswagen company policy, but he remained on its supervisory board and was involved in the company's strategic decisions until his resignation on 25 April 2015. Educated as an engineer, Piëch influenced the development of numerous significant cars including the Porsche 911, Audi Quattro and notably, the Bugatti Veyron, which as of 2012 was the fastest, most powerful and most expensive road legal automobile ever built. Due to his influence on the automobile industry, Piëch was named the Car Executive of the Century in 1999 and was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Biography== Piëch was born in Vienna, Austria, to Louise (née Porsche; Ferdinand's daughter) and Anton Piëch, a lawyer. He studied at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz and graduated from the ETH Zurich, Switzerland, in 1962, with a degree in mechanical engineering, having written a master thesis about the development of a Formula One (F1) engine. At the same time, Porsche was involved in F1 and developed an 8-cylinder engine for the Porsche 804. From 1963 to 1971, he worked at Porsche in Stuttgart, on the development of the Porsche 906 and following models that led to the successful Porsche 917. In 1972, he moved to Audi in Ingolstadt. Starting from 1975, he was manager of technological engineering, being responsible for the concepts of the Audi 80 and Audi 100. He celebrated his 40th birthday on 17 April 1977 with a ball at which guests included Giorgetto Giugiaro and at which the staff of the Porsche Hotel presented him with an Audi 80 that was just long and constructed of marzipan. In 1977 he also initiated the development of a car for the World Rally Championship, resulting in the four-wheel drive Audi Quattro. The engine used in the Quattro model was a turbocharged inline-5 cylinder unit. Piëch held a small engineering company in the time between leaving Porsche AG and joining Audi, and while there, he developed a 5-cylinder in-line diesel engine for Mercedes-Benz. He picked up the concept again after moving to Audi, because there was a market demand for engines with more than 4 cylinders. At the time, Audi (and the Audi-derived VW Passat/Santana model range) used longitudinally mounted inline engines and front wheel drive. More conservative layouts with 6 cylinders were rejected because of engineering and production costs (V6 engine) or packaging requirements (straight 6 did not fit because front wheel drive required that it be mounted in front of the axle). In 1993, Piëch moved to Volkswagen AG, parent company of the Volkswagen Group, where he became Chairman of the Board of Management, succeeding Carl Hahn. At that time Volkswagen was only three months from bankruptcy, and he was central to orchestrating its dramatic turnaround. He retired from the Board of Management in 2002, but still served in an advisory capacity as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. In 2000, he was named chairman of Scania AB.Ferdinand Piëch new chairman of the Scania Board 24 May 2000, Scania.com. He retired from the management board in 2002 and was succeeded as chairman by Bernd Pischetsrieder. While head of Volkswagen Group, Piëch was known for his aggressive moves into other markets. He drove the Volkswagen and Audi brands upmarket with great success. Piëch also pursued other marques, successfully acquiring Lamborghini for Audi, and establishing Bugatti Automobiles SAS. His purchase of British Rolls-Royce and Bentley was more controversial. After successfully buying the Crewe, England, carbuilding operation, VW was denied the use of the Rolls-Royce brand name. Piëch later claimed that he only really wanted the Bentley brand, but at the time the loss of Rolls to rival BMW was widely seen as a major failure. What was not a failure, however, was his effort to revitalize Volkswagen in North America. Hahn's previous efforts to regain market share in the United States and Canada — which he had built up as the head of Volkswagen of America from 1958 to 1965 — were unsuccessful, but Piëch helped reverse VW's fortunes by the decision to manufacture the Volkswagen New Beetle, the introduction of which in 1998 gave Volkswagen of America a much needed impulse. Due to his continued influence in the auto industry, Automobile Magazine announced that Piëch has won their Man of the Year award for 2011.Ferdinand Piech - 2011 Man of the Year - Automobile Magazine Retrieved 16 November 2010. ==Engineering== At Porsche, Piëch triggered significant changes in the company's policy. For example, the position of drivers in race cars was moved from the left to the right, as this gives advantages on the predominantly clockwise race tracks. After making mainly small race cars that were supposed to be closely related to road cars, Porsche made a risky investment by unexpectedly building twenty-five Porsche 917, surprising the rule makers at the FIA. Even Ferrari had needed to sell his company to Fiat before making such a move. Always thinking big, Piëch started development of a 16-cylinder engine for the Can-Am series. It is probably no coincidence that his grandfather had developed a famous supercharged 16-cylinder engine for the Auto Union racing cars in the 1930s. Piëch was denied the chance to complete it, as a turbocharged version of the existing 12-cylinder was simpler, more powerful and very successful. Three decades later as CEO of Volkswagen Group, Piëch insisted on the very ambitious Bugatti Veyron, with a turbocharged W16-cylinder, and top speed. Some of these figures are still not higher than those of the Porsche 917/30, but higher than most current racing cars. Piëch was also behind the Volkswagen Phaeton luxury saloon, which was intended as a rival to other German luxury cars, but the sales of the model have been disappointing. ==Porsche ownership== Piëch owned a significant share of Porsche, exactly 10%. In order to prevent discussions among the many family members, a policy was established in early 1972 that no Porsche family member is allowed to be involved in the management of the company. Even company founder Ferry Porsche, Piëch's uncle, only held a seat on the supervisory board of Porsche after the company's legal form was changed from a limited partnership to a private legal company. This made Piëch move to Audi after the foundation of his engineering bureau. ==Personal life== Piëch reportedly had 12 children from four different women, though an obituary published by The Detroit News mentioned him having 13 children.Ferdinand Piech, Longtime Volksawgen Patriarch Dies He was married to his second wife Ursula Piëch from 1984 to his death, he lived with her in retirement in Salzburg, Austria. One of his sons, Toni Piëch, is the founder of car company Piëch Automotive. He was dyslexic, an atheist, and had a vast car collection that included two Bugatti Veyrons regularly driven by him and his wife. Piëch collapsed suddenly on 25 August 2019 while having dinner with his wife in Rosenheim, Oberbayern. He was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. A specific cause of death wasn't released.Ferdinand Piech, Long Time VW Patriarch Dies at 82 ==Personality and management style== An engineer by trade, Ferdinand Piech was both known for his intricate involvement in product development from a technical standpoint, as well as his domineering personality. Piech has been behind the development of multiple significant and influential automobiles, including the Porsche 911, Third generation (C3) Audi 100, Audi Quattro and Bugatti Veyron. Automotive blog Jalopnik said of Piech, \\"He is the mad genius behind much of Porsche and Audi’s racing successes as well as VW’s all-out engineering and luxury push from the early 2000s. That’s what gave us cars like the Bugatti Veyron and the 12-cylinder VW Phaeton.\\" Piech is both noted for turning the Audi brand from an also-ran economy car builder to one of the most respected luxury brands in the world, as well as rescuing Volkswagen as a whole from near-bankruptcy and overseeing its transformation into the massive conglomerate it is today. Fellow automotive executive Bob Lutz described Piech as \\"one of the most successful leaders in the automotive business\\" and \\"the greatest living product guy\\" in the automobile industry. Automotive News described Piech as \\"a world-class eccentric but a figure of transcendent importance in the history of cars and car companies\\" who has had \\"The strangest and possibly most significant automotive industry career this side of Henry Ford\\". In their obituary, The Guardian said of Piech, “His stewardship of VW has been indisputably successful. Piech will go down in history as an automotive legend, in the same class as Gottlieb Daimler, Henry Ford and Kiichiro Toyoda.”Ferdinand Piech, Porche Partiarch and VW Saviour Dies at 82 Piech has been described as being socially awkward and having an abrasive personality; some automotive journalists who have encountered Piech described him as being uncomfortable to be around. Automotive News once noted, \\"Many of his CEO peers said they could not hold a normal conversation with him. Discussions could be punctuated with long stretches of unexplained silence.\\"A Bitter End For Ferdinand Piech Piech himself has acknowledged that he occasionally struggles to relate to other people and understand their feelings. As Piech rose to the top of Volkswagen in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then-CEO Carl Hahn took notice of Piech's poor social skills and tried to position him as a technocrat kept behind closed doors. Hahn was particularly bothered by how Piech behaved during a meeting with the Emperor of Japan; while the Emperor was showing his collection of vintage swords, Piech examined one and told the Emperor that it was a fake. Subsequently, Hahn presented the Audi Avus quattro concept car himself at the 1991 Tokyo Motor Show and didn't allow Piech to take part, which infuriated Piech due to his extensive personal involvement in the Avus quattro's creation. Piech was widely interested in pushing technological boundaries in automotive development, especially as the head of Audi. Automotive News noted of this, \\"The company’s slogan “Vorsprung durch Technik” was the personification of Piech — the belief that technology was the answer to all problems in the auto business. Audi was the test bed to prove his theory and the springboard for his ambition.\\" Piech often spearheaded the development of audacious vehicles or oversaw business decision and strategies that baffled analysts, but still proved beneficial for the company as a whole. In recounting some of the extraordinary vehicles Volkswagen put in production under Piech's watch, Wired noted that he alone pushed the Bugatti Veyron supercar into production, despite objection from other executives as well as the fact that Volkswagen lost what is believed to be millions on every Veyron sold: \\"Consider that for a moment. Long past the average retirement age, this gent greenlit one of the largest automotive losses in history and managed to keep his job. Moreover, he was hailed as a hero.\\" An aggressive and demanding manager, Piëch was known for setting both lofty and extremely specific goals and standards for projects. An example of this is with the development of the Volkswagen Phaeton luxury car, in which Piëch laid out ten parameters the car had to meet, amongst them being that the Phaeton should be capable of being driven all day at with an exterior temperature of whilst maintaining the interior temperature at . Piëch requested this even though the Phaeton's top speed was electronically limited to .Top Gear Series 2 Episode 10, July 20, 2003 Another requirement was that the car should possess torsional rigidity of 37,000 N·m/degree. Piech would often become personally involved in vehicle development, such as how he oversaw the development of the Audi 100's aerodynamics himself, keeping it secret from even Audi's top engineers to prevent any crucial details of the car's aerodynamic capabilities from leaking to competitors. Piech often liked to ride along with automotive journalists during press test drives and would consider their critiques to improve Volkswagen's vehicles. Car and Driver writer John Phillips recounted how when he test drove the Volkswagen New Beetle during its launch in 1997, Piech rode along and asked for his opinion on how its chassis and driving dynamics could be improved.John Phillips: We're Not Done With You Yet, Piëch Similarly, Piech once demanded that an Automobile reviewer take the Volkswagen Phaeton up to its top speed while he rode along in the back seat. With a leadership style described as \\"old fashioned\\", Piech was known for his prolific firing of subordinates throughout his career, particularly how he engineered the ousting of former Volkswagen CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder and Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking. According to Piëch, he fires any subordinate who \\"makes the same mistake twice\\". The Guardian noted, \\"Piech was known for his ability to outmanoeuvre competitors by stoking internal rivalries to his own advantage, even if it resulted in turning against his own managers, including the VW chief executive Bernd Pischetsrieder, to side with VW’s labour leaders.\\" Piech has leveraged this reputation to use threats and intimidation to get subordinates to meet his lofty goals; during Piech's induction into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2014, fellow automotive executive Bob Lutz recounted a conversation he had with Piëch at the Frankfurt Auto Show in the early 1990s, in which he remarked how he was impressed with the fit and finish and tight body tolerances on Volkswagen's new models. Piëch told Lutz that he achieved this by assembling Volkswagen's top body engineers in his office and telling them they would all be fired if all of Volkswagen's vehicles didn't have body tolerances of 3 millimeters within six weeks. Wired described Piech as \\"Machiavellian\\" and \\"an autocrat's autocrat\\". Bob Lutz said of his management style, \\"It's what I call a reign of terror and a culture where performance was driven by fear and intimidation[...]That management style gets short-term results, but it's a culture that's extremely dangerous. Look at dictators. Dictators invariably wind up destroying the very countries they thought their omniscience and omnipotence would make great. It's fast and it's efficient, but at huge risk.\\" He would also describe Piech as a \\"mad genius\\" that while he respected, he would never want to work for or with at any capacity.

It was the home of West Ham United from 1904 to 2016. The stadium was also briefly used by Charlton Athletic in the early 1990s during their years of financial difficulty. The seating capacity of the ground at closure was 35,016. From the 2016–17 season, West Ham United have played their home matches at the London Stadium in nearby Stratford. The last first-class match played at the Boleyn Ground was on 10 May 2016, a 3–2 West Ham United win in the Premier League against Manchester United. The stadium was demolished in 2016 to make way for a new development. ==History== West Ham United took up tenancy of the Boleyn Ground from local club Boleyn Castle in 1904, after the two clubs amalgamated. West Ham rented Green Street House and grounds in East Ham from the Roman Catholic Church from around 1912. Green Street House was known locally as Boleyn Castle because of its imposing nature and an association with Anne Boleyn, who had either stayed at or, as some believe, owned the house. Hence the ground became known as the Boleyn Ground. The ground was also often referred to as Upton Park, after the Upton Park, London area where it is located. In August 1944, a V-1 flying bomb fell on the south-west corner of the pitch. This forced West Ham to play its matches at other grounds while repairs were undertaken, but it did not affect performances as West Ham managed nine consecutive victories. Upon their return to the ground in December 1944, they lost 1–0 to Tottenham Hotspur. By 1990, West Ham were required to convert Upton Park into an all-seater stadium for the 1994-95 season in order to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report. The first stage of the redevelopment came in 1993, when the South Bank was replaced by a 9,000 seat, two-tier stand named in honour of former captain Bobby Moore, who had died earlier that year. The stand incorporated executive boxes as well as a digital clock. The North Bank was demolished in 1994 and a new 6,000 seat, two-tier stand named the \\"Centenary Stand\\" was opened on its site the following year; this was later renamed the \\"Sir Trevor Brooking Stand\\". The East Stand Lower was also converted into an all-seater stand. The final change came in 2000, when the West Stand was replaced by a 15,000 seat, two-tier stand named the \\"Dr. Martens Stand\\". The stand incorporated executive boxes on two levels as well as the West Ham United Hotel. This gave the stadium a 35,000 all-seater capacity. There were plans to increase the capacity to approximately 40,500 through the building of a new larger East Stand, that would have used the spare space created when the Doctor Martens stand was built further West than the old West Stand. However, these plans never came to fruition. ===Decision to demolish=== Through 2006, talk was rife of West Ham moving to the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, with speculation increasing after new club chairman Eggert Magnusson confirmed he was interested in a move there. However, talks broke down between the club and the Olympic Committee after it was announced the Stadium would be reduced to a 25,000 capacity all-seater after the Olympic Games, which was 10,000 less than the Boleyn Ground's capacity, and the stadium would be keeping its running track, leaving supporters further from the pitch and affecting the atmosphere within the stadium. Rumours suggested West Ham might move to a new stadium at the Parcelforce depot near to West Ham Underground/mainline station instead. Indeed, on 7 November 2007, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone announced a new site had been identified for West Ham's new stadium. However, in 2009, club CEO Scott Duxbury announced West Ham had obtained planning permission to expand the East Stand; this would have brought the stadium's capacity over 40,000. Then, in 2010, new club owners David Gold and David Sullivan announced West Ham would move to the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Olympics after all. On 23 March 2010, the club announced it was working on a joint bid with Newham London Borough Council to move into the Olympic Stadium. On 30 September 2010, the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at 10 Downing Street, and the world's largest live entertainment company Live Nation endorsed the club's Olympic Stadium plans on 8 October 2010. Three days after Live Nation's endorsement UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode. In November 2010, West Ham commenced a search for potential developers for \\"informal discussions\\" about what would happen to the ground if it did take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. The decision, in favour of West Ham's bid, was unanimous. On 3 March 2011, West Ham United's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was approved by the British government and London mayor Boris Johnson; but due to ongoing legal challenges to the arrangement by Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient, the deal to sell the Olympic Stadium to West Ham collapsed on 11 October 2011, West Ham announced plans to become tenants of the stadium and on 22 March 2013 after months of voting and negotiations, West Ham won the Olympic Stadium bidding. West Ham were offered a 99-year lease and hoped to move there in time for the 2016–17 season. In February 2014, West Ham announced the sale of the Boleyn Ground to the development company the Galliard Group, to be effected once the move to the Olympic Stadium was complete. ===The final game=== Winston Reid, scorer of the last goal at the Boleyn Ground When the Premier League fixtures were drawn-up at the start of the 2015–16 Premier League season, Swansea City were planned to be West Ham's final opponents at the Boleyn Ground, on 7 May 2016. However, due to Manchester United's involvement in the FA Cup on 23 April when they were due to play West Ham, the fixture was rearranged to 10 May 2016. The match was preceded by violence on Green Street when the coach carrying the players and staff of Manchester United was pelted with missiles resulting in broken windows. With the coach delayed, the players were late arriving at the ground and the scheduled 19:45 kick-off was moved to 20:15. In the 2,398th match played at the ground, with both sides looking to qualify for European football in the 2016–17 season, in front of a crowd of 34,907, West Ham took the lead in the tenth minute through Diafra Sakho, only for Manchester United to make the score 1–2 with two goals from Anthony Martial. However, Michail Antonio equalized for West Ham and Winston Reid scored a third in the 80th minute to make it 3–2, the final score. It was West Ham's 384th Premier League match at the ground, the win signifying 601 home Premier League points won there. Mark Noble was named Man of the Match. The match was followed by a 45-minute display on the pitch in celebration of the history of the ground. The following day, the club condemned the violence aimed at the Manchester United coach, vowing to ban for life any person convicted. Three people were arrested on the night of the game, two for pitch incursion and one for throwing a bottle at the police. The following day, the Metropolitan Police issued pictures of four men they hoped to identify in connection with the coach attack. === Closure, demolition and redevelopment === The sale of the Ground was completed on 15 July 2016, at a sale price of £40,000,000. The developer's plans include 838 new homes, retail outlets and leisure facilities which will be available by 2018. The possibility of a statue of Bobby Moore and a landscaped garden named after him has also been revealed. The plans caused controversy for only including 51 \\"affordable\\" homes and no social housing. In March 2016, plans were approved for 800 homes to be built on the site, 25% of which would be affordable housing. On 14 March 2016, the dismantling of the ground began with the removal of the John Lyall gates for transfer and reinstallation at the Olympic Stadium. By July 2016, the seats had been removed from the ground and it was boarded-up and handed over to developers for demolition and redevelopment. In August 2016, ownership of the site was transferred to Barratt London. In September 2016, the ground was used as a film-set for the film Final Score and on 27 September 2016 it hosted a charity match shortly before demolition commenced. 1,000 of 1,400 commemorative bricks were saved by Jonjo Heuerman when the wall they were in was taken down, and are available to be claimed by the fans who paid for them. The inscriptions have been reproduced in a pathway at the new ground. ==The stands== The record attendance at the ground was 42,322, against Tottenham in an old Division One match on 17 October 1970, when the North and South Banks were terraced, as was the old \\"Chicken Run\\" at the front of the East Stand. Champions Statue on Barking Road. Left to right: Martin Peters, Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore (aloft), Ray Wilson. The Boleyn Ground became an all-seater stadium from the early 1990s because clubs had to meet new FA regulations for stadium safety after the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989. The record attendance after Upton Park became an all-seater was 35,550, on 21 September 2002 for a Premier League match against Manchester City. Before its closure, the ground had a total capacity of 35,016, all seated. Upton Park had four main stands, the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand, Bobby Moore Stand, East Stand and Betway Stand. ===Sir Trevor Brooking Stand=== The North Bank, 1991, before redevelopment. The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand. The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand (formerly the North Bank then the Centenary Stand) was built in 1995 which coincided with the club's 100th season, after being formed in 1895 as Thames Ironworks. Its name was changed from the Centenary Stand to the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand in July 2009. The stand held around 6,000 seats, and had two tiers, with the upper tier seating known as the family section, as supporters could only purchase tickets there if with a child. The lower tier behind the goal was split between home and away fans. West Ham initially gave around 2,500–3,000 tickets to away supporters, going from the furthest side to the left of the bottom tier right up to behind the goal. If the away side could not sell all their tickets, they were returned and re-sold to home supporters, as there was big demand from West Ham fans to purchase seats in the lower seating area. Home fans in the lower area generally preferred to stand during games and sing throughout. It was known as one of the more atmospheric sections of the stadium, especially with the two sets of supporters next to each other (separated by stewards and police). There was also one of two large LED video screens situated in the corner between the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand Stand and the East Stand. ===East Stand=== Boleyn Ground view from the East Stand before kick-off in the FA Cup against Liverpool, one of the last night games to be played at the venue. The East Stand The East Stand was situated on the far side of the Boleyn Ground, opposite the West Stand which housed the offices and dressing rooms. The stand was the oldest and smallest stand in the stadium, being built in 1969 and held only 5,000 seats due to its narrow width. The stand was known as the loudest and most intimidating stand at Upton Park. The stand was known as the 'Chicken Run', a name that had originally been applied to an earlier stand. This was an old wooden stand (standing room only) on the east side of the pitch. Unusually, the roof sloped down away from the pitch and it was surrounded by a similar sort of wire to that used on chicken runs, so when viewed from the opposite side of the ground it looked like a chicken run. The front of the stand was very close to the pitch. It was knocked down and rebuilt in 1969. The stand at one point had the words \\"DAGENHAM MOTORS\\" written into the bottom tier through the seats, but was only changed during the 2006–07 season, despite the club splitting from their sponsorship with the car company back in 1997. The stand was also the only stand left at Upton Park to still have a small minority of wooden seats (at the time of demolition), in the middle of the upper tier. There were also plans to build a new East Stand soon after the Dr. Martens stand was completed in 2001, which would have seen the stadium's capacity rise from 35,345 to around 40,500, but the plans were put on hold after a combination of resistance from the local residents behind the stand and the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2003, which spiralled the club into debt at the time. ===Bobby Moore Stand=== The Bobby Moore Stand The South Bank, Boleyn Ground, 1991, before redevelopment The Bobby Moore Stand (formerly the South Bank) was built in 1993 and held up to 9,000 spectators, all seated. The stand was built originally to comply with new stadium all-seater regulations, and the name of the stand was decided after the death of the club's legendary captain from the successful mid-1960s side in the same year of construction. The stand had two tiers, and spelt the words \\"WEST HAM UNITED\\" through the seats of both tiers. The lower tier of the Bobby Moore stand, like the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand, was well known for its supporters' passion and the atmosphere created through standing and singing. The stand had executive boxes situated between the upper and lower tiers, and a digital clock. The stand was renovated in 2001 after the construction of the new Dr. Martens Stands, with a second LED video screen in the stadium being introduced between the two stands and new seats added on the end of the stand to join with the new Dr. Martens Stand. ===The Betway Stand=== View from the West Stand The West Stand was the newest and by far the largest stand inside Upton Park, holding up to 15,000 spectators and was renamed after Betway became West Ham's official sponsors. West Ham join Forces with Alpari (UK) The stand was built in 2001 as the Dr. Martens Stand, bringing the stadium capacity up from around 26,000 to 35,647. The West Stand was the main stand in Upton Park, as it included two tiers for paying home supporters, separated by two tiers of executive boxes. The stand also hosted all the club's offices, board rooms, suites, dressing rooms, official shop, and the West Ham United Hotel. It was the largest single football stand in London. The stand's main feature was seen from the exterior of the stadium, with two large turrets built onto the stand with the club badge embedded on both, going with the theme of the club's badge. The terrace also had two scoreboards at both corners joining with the Centenary and Bobby Moore Stands, displaying the score and time of the game in process. The stand was so large, it was visible from the A406 North Circular Road and from the A13 Newham Way, where people could clearly make out the roof of the stand over the tower blocks. The stand was officially opened by HM The Queen, where Her Majesty was introduced to the manager and captain at the time, Glenn Roeder and Joe Cole. In 2009, following the end of Dr. Martens sponsorship, the stand resumed the old name of the West Stand.Season tickets selling well – whufc.com In 2011, the club signed a three-year agreement for the stand to be named \\"The Alpari Stand\\". ==Other events== In June 1989, evangelist Billy Graham hosted a three-day Christian mission to London to which free tickets were given away. He gave away more tickets than seats, not expecting them all to be used. In the event they were used and many were locked out. After negotiations between the club and Graham's representatives, the crowd were allowed to use the pitch. On 12 February 2003, England played Australia at the Boleyn Ground in an international friendly, with Australia winning 3–1. The match is best known for marking Wayne Rooney's international debut. On 9 May 2012, the Boleyn Ground was confirmed as the venue for the fight between David Haye and Dereck Chisora, a fight sanctioned by the Luxembourg Boxing Federation on 14 July 2012. The fight caused controversy at the time as neither fighter held a license from the British Boxing Board of Control. On 12 November 2014, a friendly game between Argentina and Croatia was played at the Boleyn Ground. The match finished 2–1 to Argentina and saw the return of former West Ham striker Carlos Tevez to the Boleyn Ground. The stadium is the setting of the 2018 film Final Score. An ex-soldier, played by Dave Bautista, is forced into action to defend the packed stadium when armed Russian terrorists take control of it. ===International matches=== ==References== ==External links== *Stadium Information on whufc.com *Stadium Tour on kumb.com * Category:West Ham United F.C.

As of September 2016, the town has an estimated population of 3,042 and a population density of 5.8 persons per km². The total area is 527.54 km². Oketo was originally a logging community, and is currently involved in farming as well. Popular crops include potatoes, white flower beans and beets. Dairy farming and cattle farming are also practiced. Oketo was the tug-of-war champion of Japan for a number of years in the 1960s. That tradition of showing strength continues today in the Ningen Banba festival which is held in July every year. During the Ningen Bamba, teams of 5 or 7 men pull sleds of logs over man-made hills to the finish line. ==Education== Oketo has one elementary school, Oketo Elementary School. Previously, the town had four active elementary schools but due to the decline in population, three of them have been closed. Oketo Junior High School is the only junior high school in town. There is also a prefectural high school located in Oketo, Oketo High School, which offers a social welfare course of study. ==History== Oketo is well known in Japan for its wood crafts, called Oke-Craft. The majority of these crafts are household objects such as plates and bowls. They are usually made from a local white pine. In prehistoric times the mountains near Oketo (e.g. Oketoyama) were a major source of obsidian used for cutting tools and arrowheads. ==External links== *Official Website Category:Towns in Hokkaido ","title":"Oketo, Hokkaido"},{"id":"1438816","text":"was a town located in Tokoro District, Abashiri Subprefecture (now Okhotsk Subprefecture), Hokkaido, Japan.

The film was directed by Jon Avnet and written by Avnet and Paul Brickman. This miniseries was first aired on the NBC television network over two consecutive nights in November 2001. ==Plot== On 1 September 1939, Germany invades Poland and after which the regulation was promulgated that all Polish Jews should move to the newly created Warsaw Ghetto. As in all the ghettos, a Judenrat was appointed and was responsible for the administration of the ghetto. The film tells the moral dilemmas faced by Adam Czerniaków (Donald Sutherland), head of the Judenrat in the Warsaw Ghetto, who was ordered to carry out orders of the German authorities, including sending Jews to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. A group of Polish Jews decide to rebel against the Germans and not to lend a hand to the murder of their brethren. They begin to organize their people in order to protect the honor of the Jewish people, but Czerniaków as the leader of the Judenrat objects to this activity, fearing violent German retaliation against the Jews in the ghetto. By the close of 1942, people living in the ghetto realize they are doomed as the deportations to Treblinka began. The rudiments of resistance are planned by Mordechai Anielewicz (Hank Azaria) together with Yitzhak Zuckerman (David Schwimmer) and laid the foundation for the Jewish Combat Organization, Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa (ZOB). The film illustrates the moral dilemmas of members of the Jewish Combat Organization during the preparations for the revolt: \\"How to remain moral, in an immoral society?\\" On January 18, 1943, Nazis raid the ghetto again, but this time the Jews resist. The Jewish Combat Organization stops the Nazi raids into the ghetto. Germans return on 18 April 1943, and the uprising in the ghetto breaks out. In the intervening time, many of the ghetto residents construct hidden shelters or bunkers in the basements and cellars of the buildings, often with tunnels leading to other buildings. The handful of fighters who have weapons take to these shelters, giving the uprising the advantage of defensive positions. The fighters hold out for more than a month. In the more than three hours mini-series, we see a realistic and docu-like representation of what happened at the Warsaw ghetto. ==Cast== * Leelee Sobieski as Tosia Altman * Hank Azaria as Mordechai Anielewicz * David Schwimmer as Yitzhak \\"Antek\\" Zuckerman * Jon Voight as Maj.

Most of the people of Polish nationality appearing in the film are depicted as anti- Semites who look indifferently or approving of the extermination of Jews. The film omits the fact that the Poles were also repressed and sentenced to extermination by the Nazis.

A biometric passport (also known as an e-passport, ePassport, or a digital passport) is a traditional passport that has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip which contains biometric information that can be used to authenticate the identity of the passport holder. It uses contactless smart card technology, including a microprocessor chip (computer chip) and antenna (for both power to the chip and communication) embedded in the front or back cover, or centre page, of the passport. The passport's critical information is printed on the data page of the passport, repeated on the machine readable lines and stored in the chip. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip, making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented. Many countries are moving towards issuing biometric passports to their citizens. Malaysia was the first country to issue biometric passports in 1998. In December 2008, 60 countries were issuing such passports, which increased to 120 by June 2017. The currently standardised biometrics used for this type of identification system are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including retinal scan. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9303 (ICAO9303). The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in JPEG or JPEG2000 format) of each biometric feature is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the contactless chip, it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of EEPROM storage memory, and runs on an interface in accordance with the ISO/IEC 14443 international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books. Some national identity cards, such as those from the Netherlands, Albania and Brazil, are fully ICAO9303 compliant biometric travel documents. However others, such as the United States Passport Card, are not. ==Data protection== Biometric passports have protection mechanisms to avoid and/or detect attacks: ; Non-traceable chip characteristics: Random chip identifiers reply to each request with a different chip number. This prevents tracing of passport chips. Using random identification numbers is optional. ; Basic Access Control (BAC): BAC protects the communication channel between the chip and the reader by encrypting transmitted information. Before data can be read from a chip, the reader needs to provide a key which is derived from the Machine Readable Zone: the date of birth, the date of expiry and the document number. If BAC is used, an attacker cannot (easily) eavesdrop transferred information without knowing the correct key. Using BAC is optional. ; Passive Authentication (PA): PA is aimed at identifying modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file, Document Security Object (SOD), that stores hash values of all files stored in the chip (picture, fingerprint, etc.) and a digital signature of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip (e.g., the picture) is changed, this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory. According to a September 2011 United States Central Intelligence Agency document released by WikiLeaks in December 2014, \\"Although falsified e-passports will not have the correct digital signature, inspectors may not detect the fraud if the passports are from countries that do not participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization's Public Key Directory (ICAO PKD). As of January 2017, 55 of over 60 e-passport-issuing countries belong to the PKD program. ; Active Authentication (AA): AA prevents cloning of passport chips. The chip contains a private key that cannot be read or copied, but its existence can easily be proven. Using AA is optional. ; Extended Access Control (EAC): EAC adds functionality to check the authenticity of both the chip (chip authentication) and the reader (terminal authentication). Furthermore, it uses stronger encryption than BAC. EAC is typically used to protect fingerprints and iris scans. Using EAC is optional. In the European Union, using EAC is mandatory for all documents issued starting 28 June 2009. ; Supplemental Access Control (SAC): SAC was introduced by ICAO in 2009 for addressing BAC weaknesses. It was introduced as a supplement to BAC (for keeping compatibility), but will replace it in the future. ; Shielding the chip: This prevents unauthorised reading. Some countries – including at least the US – have integrated a very thin metal mesh into the passport's cover to act as a shield when the passport cover is closed. The use of shielding is optional. To assure interoperability and functionality of the security mechanisms listed above, ICAO and German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have specified several test cases. These test specifications are updated with every new protocol and are covering details starting from the paper used and ending in the chip that is included. ==Attacks== Since the introduction of biometric passports, several attacks have been presented and demonstrated. ; Non- traceable chip characteristics : In 2008 a Radboud/Lausitz University team demonstrated that it's possible to determine which country a passport chip is from without knowing the key required for reading it. The team fingerprinted error messages of passport chips from different countries. The resulting lookup table allows an attacker to determine from where a chip originated. In 2010 Tom Chothia and Vitaliy Smirnov documented an attack that allows an individual passport to be traced, by sending specific BAC authentication requests. In 2016 Avoine et al. published a survey on security and privacy issues in passport protocols, where a new technique to track passports is introduced, based on the response time of basic commands. ; Basic Access Control (BAC) : In 2005 Marc Witteman showed that the document numbers of Dutch passports were predictable, allowing an attacker to guess/crack the key required for reading the chip. In 2006 Adam Laurie wrote software that tries all known passport keys within a given range, thus implementing one of Witteman's attacks. Using online flight booking sites, flight coupons and other public information it's possible to significantly reduce the number of possible keys. In some early biometric passports BAC wasn't used at all, allowing attacker to read the chip's content without providing a key. ; Passive Authentication (PA) : In 2006 Lukas Grunwald demonstrated that it is trivial to copy passport data from a passport chip into a standard ISO/IEC 14443 smartcard using a standard contactless card interface and a simple file transfer tool. Grunwald used a passport that did not use Active Authentication (anti-cloning) and did not change the data held on the copied chip, thus keeping its cryptographic signature valid. : In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that not all passport inspection systems check the cryptographic signature of a passport chip. For his demonstration Van Beek altered chip information and signed it using his own document signing key of a non-existing country. This can only be detected by checking the country signing keys that are used to sign the document signing keys. To check country signing keys the ICAO PKD can be used. Only 5 out of 60+ countries are using this central database. Van Beek did not update the original passport chip: instead an ePassport emulator was used. : Also in 2008, The Hacker's Choice implemented all attacks and published code to verify the results. The release included a video clip that demonstrated problems by using a forged Elvis Presley passport that is recognized as a valid US passport. ; Active Authentication (AA) : In 2005 Marc Witteman showed that the secret Active Authentication key can be retrieved using power analysis. This may allow an attacker to clone passport chips that use the optional Active Authentication anti-cloning mechanism on chips – if the chip design is susceptible to this attack. : In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that optional security mechanisms can be disabled by removing their presence from the passport index file. This allows an attacker to remove – amongst others – anti-cloning mechanisms (Active Authentication). The attack is documented in supplement 7 of Doc 9303 (R1-p1_v2_sIV_0006)accessdate April 26, 2009 and can be solved by patching inspection system software. Note that supplement 7 features vulnerable examples in the same document that – when implemented – result in a vulnerable inspection process. : In 2014 Calderoni et al. show a procedure to bypass the security protocol that is commonly adopted to prove chip authenticity (Active Authentication) within first-generation electronic passports. The discussed breach is related to some metadata files (EF.COM, EF.SOD) and allows the attacker to conceal those data required by the inspection system during the protocol's execution. This breach may facilitate a malicious user in using fake documents cloned from original ones. ; Extended Access Control (EAC) : In 2007 Lukas Grunwald presented an attack that can make EAC-enabled passport chips unusable. Grunwald states that if an EAC-key – required for reading fingerprints and updating certificates – is stolen or compromised, an attacker can upload a false certificate with an issue date far in the future. The affected chips block read access until the future date is reached. ==Opposition== Privacy proponents in many countries question and protest the lack of information about exactly what the passports' chip will contain, and whether they impact civil liberties. The main problem they point out is that data on the passports can be transferred with wireless RFID technology, which can become a major vulnerability. Although this could allow ID-check computers to obtain a person's information without a physical connection, it may also allow anyone with the necessary equipment to perform the same task. If the personal information and passport numbers on the chip are not encrypted, the information might wind up in the wrong hands. On 15 December 2006, the BBC published an article on the British ePassport, citing the above stories and adding that: :\\"Nearly every country issuing this passport has a few security experts who are yelling at the top of their lungs and trying to shout out: 'This is not secure. This is not a good idea to use this technology'\\", citing a specialist who states \\"It is much too complicated. It is in places done the wrong way round – reading data first, parsing data, interpreting data, then verifying whether it is right. There are lots of technical flaws in it and there are things that have just been forgotten, so it is basically not doing what it is supposed to do. It is supposed to get a higher security level. It is not.\\" and adding that the Future of Identity in the Information Society (FIDIS) network's research team (a body of IT security experts funded by the European Union) has \\"also come out against the ePassport scheme... [stating that] European governments have forced a document on its people that dramatically decreases security and increases the risk of identity theft.\\"Budapest Declaration on Machine Readable Travel Documents, FIDIS NoE, Budapest, September 2006 Most security measures are designed against untrusted citizens (the \\"provers\\"), but the scientific security community recently also addressed the threats from untrustworthy verifiers, such as corrupt governmental organizations, or nations using poorly implemented, unsecure electronic systems. New cryptographic solutions such as private biometrics are being proposed to mitigate threats of mass theft of identity. These are under scientific study, but not yet implemented in biometric passports. ==Countries using biometric passports== Availability of biometric passports as of mid 2019 ===European Union=== It was planned that, except for Denmark and Ireland, EU passports would have digital imaging and fingerprint scan biometrics placed on their RFID chips. This combination of biometrics aims to create an unrivaled level of security and protection against fraudulent identification papers. Technical specifications for the new passports have been established by the European Commission.EC News article about the relevant regulations: Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004, Commission Decision C(2005)409 adopted on 28 February 2005 and Commission Decision C(2006)2909 adopted on 28 June 2006 The specifications are binding for the Schengen agreement parties, i.e. the EU countries, except Ireland and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries—Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004, see preamble 10–14 These countries are obliged to implement machine readable facial images in the passports by 28 August 2006, and fingerprints by 29 June 2009. The European Data Protection Supervisor has stated that the current legal framework fails to \\"address all the possible and relevant issues triggered by the inherent imperfections of biometric systems\\".Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, 6 August 2008 Irish biometric passports only used a digital image and not fingerprinting. German passports printed after 1 November 2007 contain two fingerprints, one from each hand, in addition to a digital photograph. Romanian passports will also contain two fingerprints, one from each hand. The Netherlands also takes fingerprints and washttps://www.security.nl/posting/32771/Donner+stopt+opslag+vingerafdruk+paspoort the only EU member that had plans to store these fingerprints centrally. According to EU requirements, only nations that are signatories to the Schengen acquis are required to add fingerprint biometrics.

In February 2007, the first biometric passport was introduced. The cover of the new biometric passport remains essentially the same as that of previous versions, with the addition of the \\"electronic passport\\" logo at the bottom. However, the design of the inner pages has changed substantially. The design conforms with the document design recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization. The new ePassport featured in the 2008 Stockholm Challenge Event and was a finalist for the Stockholm Challenge Award in the Public Administration category. The Hong Kong SAR ePassport design was praised on account of the \\"multiple state-of-the-art technologies [which] are seamlessly integrated in the sophisticated Electronic Passport System (e-Passport System)\\".

India initiated the first phase deployment of Biometric e-Passport only for all diplomatic passport holders in India and abroad in 2008. The new passports have been designed indigenously by the Central Passport Organization, the India Security Press, Nashik and IIT Kanpur. The passport contains a security chip with personal data and digital images. Initially, the new passports will have a 64KB chip with a photograph of passport holder and subsequently include the holder's fingerprint(s). The biometric passport has been tested with passport readers abroad and is noted to have a 4-second response time – less than that of a US Passport (10 seconds). The passport need not be carried in a metal jacket for security reasons as it first needs to be passed through a reader, after which it generates access keys to unlock the chip data for reader access. On 25 June 2008 Indian Passport Authority issued the first e-passport to Pratibha Patil the President of India at the time. The e-passport project is under the first phase of deployment and will be initially restricted to diplomatic passport holders only. In mid 2019, the Government of India floated a three-stage international tender for the manufacture of e-passports for ordinary Indian citizens. Once the tendering and procurement process is complete, the government hopes to start issuing e-passports for ordinary Indian citizens sometime in the coming years. ===Indonesia=== Issued since 26 January 2011.

This was optional. In August 2013, any passport expiring in more than 2 years could be replaced free of charge with a biometric one upon request. Passports expiring within 2 years were charged the full fee. The review of the pilot project (that was supposed to be concluded in 2015) was postponed by order of the Minister of the Interior to a later date, due to the controversy regarding the creation of the Biometric Database rather than storing the biometric data only in the passport's chip, as is the practice in many other countries. In 2015, the duration of the pilot project was extended until 2017. In May 2017, the pilot project ended. Newly issued passports were then required to be biometric. To obtain a biometric passport, an applicant must appear in an Interior Ministry office \\"to be photographed by the special camera which records information such as facial bone structure, distance between one's eyes, ears to eyes and ratio of facial features one from another. The applicant will also be fingerprinted and all this information will be stored in the new high-tech electronic passport.\\"Jewish News: The Yeshiva World, Israel Moving to Biometric Passport. ===Japan=== Issued since March 2006.

Malaysia is however not a member of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and its first biometric passport did not conform to the same standards as the VWP biometric document because the Malaysian biometric passport was issued several years ahead of the VWP requirement. The difference lies in the storage of fingerprint template instead of fingerprint image in the chip, the rest of the technologies are the same. Also the biometric passport was designed to be read only if the receiving country has the authorisation from the Malaysian Immigration Department. Malaysia started issuing ICAO compliant passports from February 2010. Malaysia used to issue passports with validity for 2 years and 5 years, but the passport with 2 years validity was withdrawn since January 2015. The pricing for a Malaysian passport are RM 200 (approximately USD 50) with 5 years validity, RM100 (approximately USD 25) for senior citizens, children below 12, Hajj pilgrims, and students below 21 and studying abroad is RM100 and is free for disabled citizens. ===Maldives=== Issued since 26 July 2006.

There are two identifying factors: the small symbol on the front cover (20px), indicating that an electronic chip has been embedded in the passport and the polycarbonate leaf in the front (version 2009) of the book, inside which the chip is located. Like Australia, New Zealand has installed SmartGates into airports to allow New Zealand ePassport and ePassport holders of 4 other countries (Australia, Canada, UK, and US) to clear immigration controls more rapidly, and facial recognition technology has been installed at immigration gates. The cost is NZ$140 (when applying in person) or NZ$124.50 (when applying online—available only if already holding a passport) for adults, NZ$81.70 for children, which were valid for five years if issued before December 2015.

The U.S. Department of State first issued these passports in 2006, and since August 2007 issues biometric passports only. Non-biometric passports are valid until their expiration dates. Although a system able to perform a facial-recognition match between the bearer and his or her image stored on the contactless chip is desired, it is unclear when such a system will be deployed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at its ports of entry. A high level of security became a priority for the United States after the attacks of 11 September 2001. High security required cracking down on counterfeit passports. In October 2004, the production stages of this high-tech passport commenced as the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) issued awards to the top bidders of the program. The awards totaled to roughly $1,000,000 for startup, development, and testing. The driving force of the initiative is the U.S. Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the \\"Border Security Act\\"), which states that such smartcard identity cards will be able to replace visas. As for foreigners travelling to the U.S., if they wish to enter U.S. visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), they are now required to possess machine-readable passports that comply with international standards. Additionally, for travellers holding a valid passport issued on or after 26 October 2006, such a passport must be a biometric passport if used to enter the U.S. visa-free under the VWP. In November 2018, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Delta Air Lines opened the nation's first curb-to-gate biometric terminal, which promised to improve aviation security while moving travelers faster through screening.US airport opens first fully biometric terminal - CNN travel ===Uruguay=== The Uruguayan Ministry of the Interior started to issue biometric passports to Uruguayan citizens on 16 October 2015. The new passport complies with the standards set forth by the Visa Waiver Program of the United States. ===Uzbekistan=== In Uzbekistan on 23 June 2009 Islam Karimov issued a Presidential Decree \\"On measures to further improve the passport system in the Republic of Uzbekistan.\\" On 29 December 2009 the President of Uzbekistan signed a decree to change the dates for a phased exchange of populations existing passport to the biometric passport. In accordance with this decree, biometric passports will be phased in, beginning with 1 January 2011. In the first phase, the biometric passport will be issued to employees of ministries, departments and agencies of the republic, individuals who travel abroad or outside the country, as well as citizens who receive a passport in connection with the achievement of a certain age or for other grounds provided by law. The second phase will be for the rest of the population who will be able to get new passports for the period from 2012 to 2015. ===Venezuela=== Issued after July 2007, Venezuela was the first Latin American country issuing passports including RFID chips along other major security improvements. The chip has photo and fingerprints data. === Vietnam === From 1 July 2020, Vietnamese citizens will be able to apply for new electronic passports. ===Zimbabwe=== Introduced in June 2017. ==See also== * International Civil Aviation Organization Public Key Directory * National biometric id card * Self-sovereign identity * Vaccination card ==References== ==External links== ICAO passport standards and related materials: *ICAO Doc 9303 Series.

Although the treaty was not approved by the Cherokee National Council nor signed by Principal Chief John Ross, it was amended and ratified in March 1836, and became the legal basis for the forcible removal known as the Trail of Tears. == Background == === Early discussions === By the late 1720s, the territory of the Cherokee Indian nation lay almost entirely in northwestern Georgia, with small parts in Tennessee, Alabama, and North Carolina. It extended across most of the northern border and all of the border with Tennessee. An estimated 16,000 Cherokee people lived in this territory. Others had emigrated west to present-day Texas and Arkansas. In 1826, the Georgia legislature asked President John Quincy Adams to negotiate a removal treaty. Adams, a supporter of Indian sovereignty, initially refused, but when Georgia threatened to nullify the current treaty, he approached the Cherokee to negotiate. A year passed without any progress toward removal. Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and supporter of Indian removal, was elected president in 1828. === Georgia laws over Cherokee Indian territory === Shortly after the 1828 election, Georgia acted on its nullification threat. The legislature passed a series of laws abolishing the independent government of the Cherokee and extending state law over their territory. Cherokee officials were forbidden to meet for legislative purposes. White people (including missionaries and those married to Cherokee) were forbidden to live in Cherokee country without a state permit, and Cherokee were forbidden to testify in court cases involving European Americans. Soon after his inauguration, Jackson wrote an open letter to the Southeastern Indian nations, urging them to move west. After gold was discovered in Georgia in late 1829, the ensuing Georgia Gold Rush increased white residents' determination to see the Cherokee removed. The Cherokee were forbidden to dig for gold, and Georgia authorized a survey of their lands to prepare for a lottery to distribute the land to whites. The state held the lottery in 1832. In the following session, the state legislature stripped the Cherokee of all land other than their residences and adjoining improvements. By 1834 this exception was also removed. When state judges intervened on behalf of Cherokee residents, they were harassed and denied jurisdiction over such cases. === Cherokee reaction === The new laws targeted the Cherokee leadership in particular. The hereditary chiefs were selected from men who belonged to the important clans of the matrilineal culture. They gained their status from their Cherokee mothers and their clans, although by this time, there were several of mixed race. Principal Chief John Ross was also of mixed race, and had tried to make use of his heritage to benefit the Cherokee in relations with whites. Since the Georgia laws made it illegal for the Cherokee to conduct national business, the National Council (the legislative body of the Cherokee Nation) cancelled the 1832 elections. It declared that current officials would retain their offices until elections could be held, and established an emergency government based in Tennessee. The Council tried to force Jackson's hand against Georgia by suing the state in federal courts and lobbying Congress to support Cherokee sovereignty. In 1832, the United States Supreme Court struck down Georgia's laws as unconstitutional in Worcester v. Georgia, ruling that only the federal government had power to deal with the Native American tribes, and the states had no power to pass legislation regulating their activities. However, the state ignored the ruling and continued to enforce the laws. == Negotiations == John Ridge === Jackson's initial proposal === Shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling, Jackson met with John Ridge, clerk of the Cherokee National Council, who headed a Cherokee delegation that went to Washington, DC, to meet with him. When asked whether he would use federal force against Georgia, Jackson said he would not and urged Ridge to persuade the Cherokee to accept removal. Ridge, until then a supporter of the National Council's position, left the White House in despair. John McLean, a Jackson appointee to the Supreme Court, likewise urged the Cherokee representatives in Washington to negotiate. Jackson quickly dispatched Secretary of War Lewis Cass to present his terms, which included western land titles, self-government, relocation assistance, and several other long-term benefits—all conditioned on a total Cherokee removal. He would allow a small number of Cherokee to stay if they accepted state authority over them. In the following months, Ridge found supporters for the removal option, including his father Major Ridge and the major's nephews Elias Boudinot and Stand Watie. In October 1832, he urged the National Council to consider Cass's proposal, but the Council was unmoved. === Divisions among the Cherokee === While Ross's delegation continued to lobby Congress for relief, the worsening situation in Georgia drove members of the Treaty Party to Washington to press for a removal treaty. Boudinot and the Ridges had come to believe that removal was inevitable, and hoped to secure Cherokee rights by agreeing to a treaty. In December 1833, the Cherokees supporting removal formed a party, with the former principal chief William Hicks as their head and John McIntosh as his assistant. They sent a delegation led by Andrew Ross, younger brother of Principal Chief John Ross. The administration refused to deal with them, but invited them to return with leaders more involved in the Cherokee Nation's affairs. They returned with Boudinot and Major Ridge, and entered negotiations with Cass. When Cass urged John Ross to join the negotiations, he denounced his brother's delegation. Andrew Ross and other members signed a harsh treaty in June 1834 without the Ridge family's support. The progress of separate negotiations finally moved John Ross to discuss terms. He made offers to cede all land except the borders of Georgia, and then to cede all land, on the condition that the Cherokee could remain in the east subject to state laws. Cass refused, saying that he would discuss only removal. Andrew Ross's treaty was submitted to the Senate, where it was rejected as not having the support of all Cherokees. In the October meeting of the Cherokee General Council (comprising all members of the Nation able to attend), a federal representative presented this treaty for consideration. John Ross condemned the treaty. The Ridges and the Waties left the Council, and they and other treaty advocates began holding their own council meetings. == Division of the Cherokee Nation East == A division developed between Ross supporters (the \\"National Party\\") advocating resistance, and the Ridge supporters (the \\"Treaty Party\\"), who advocated negotiation to secure the best terms possible for the removal, which they considered inevitable, and later protection of Cherokee rights. The Treaty Party included John Ridge, Major Ridge, Elias Boudinot, David Watie, Stand Watie, Andrew Ross, Willam Coody (Ross's nephew), William Hicks (Ross's cousin), John Walker Jr., John Fields, John Gunter, David Vann, Charles Vann, Alexander McCoy, W. A. Davis, James A. Bell, Samuel Bell, John West, Ezekiel West, Archilla Smith, and James Starr. Eventually tensions grew to the point that several Treaty advocates, most notably John Walker Jr., were assassinated. In July 1835, hundreds of Cherokee, from both the Treaty Party and the National Party (including John Ross), converged on John Ridge’s plantation, Running Waters (near Calhoun, Georgia). There they met with John F. Schermerhorn, President Jackson's envoy for a removal treaty, Return J. Meigs, Jr., the Commissioner for Indian Affairs, and other U.S. officials. In October 1835, the General Council rejected the proposed treaty, but appointed a committee to go to Washington to negotiate a better treaty. The committee included John Ross, and also treaty advocates John Ridge, Charles Vann, and Elias Boudinot (later replaced by Stand Watie). They were authorized to make a removal treaty, with the stipulation that the Cherokees would receive more than $5,000,000 in compensation and assistance. Schermerhorn, who was present at the meeting, advocated a meeting at New Echota, the Cherokee capital. The National Council approved a delegation to meet there. Both delegations (U.S. and Cherokee) were specifically charged with negotiating a removal treaty. === New Echota meeting and final treaty === Detail of memorial at New Echota 100 to 500 men converged on the Cherokee capital in December 1835, almost exclusively from the Upper and Lower Towns. (Heavy snow in the western North Carolina mountains made it nearly impossible for those from the Hill and Valley Towns to travel.) After a week of negotiations, Schermerhorn proposed that in exchange for all Cherokee land east of the Mississippi River, the Cherokees would receive $5,000,000 from the U.S. (to be distributed per capita to all members of the tribe), an additional $500,000 for educational funds, title in perpetuity to land in Indian Territory equal to that given up, and full compensation for all property left behind. (By contrast, the entire Louisiana Territory was purchased from Napoleon for just over $23,000,000.) The treaty included a clause to allow all Cherokees who so desired to remain and become citizens of the states in which they resided, on individual allotments of of land. With that clause, it was unanimously approved by the contingent at New Echota, then signed by the negotiating committee of twenty, but that clause later was struck out by President Jackson.Brown, p. 498-499 The committee reported the results to the full Council gathered at New Echota, which approved the treaty unanimously. In a lengthy preamble, the Ridge party laid out its claims to legitimacy, based on its willingness to negotiate in good faith the sort of removal terms for which Ross had expressed support. The treaty was signed by Major Ridge, Elias Boudinot, James Foster, Testaesky, Charles Moore, George Chambers, Tahyeske, Archilla Smith, Andrew Ross, William Lassley, Caetehee, Tegaheske, Robert Rogers, John Gunter, John A. Bell, Charles Foreman, William Rogers, George W. Adair, James Starr, and Jesse Halfbreed. After Schermerhorn returned to Washington with the signed treaty, John Ridge and Stand Watie added their names. The treaty was concluded at New Echota, Georgia, on December 29, 1835, and signed on March 1, 1836. == Ratification == After news of the treaty became public, the officials of the Cherokee Nation from the National Party representing the large majority of Cherokee objected that they had not approved it and that the document was invalid. John Ross and the Cherokee National Council begged the Senate not to ratify the treaty (and thereby invalidate it) due to it not being negotiated by the legal representatives of the Cherokee Nation. But the Senate passed the measure in May 1836 by a single vote. Ross drew up a petition asking Congress to void the treaty—a petition which he personally delivered to Congress in the spring of 1838 with almost 16,000 signatures attached. This was nearly as many persons as the Cherokee Nation East had within its territory, according to the 1835 Henderson Roll, including women and children, who had no vote. == Enforcement == Ross's petition was ignored by President Martin Van Buren, who directed General Winfield Scott to forcibly move all those Cherokee who had not yet complied with the treaty and moved west. The Cherokee people were almost entirely removed west of the Mississippi (except for the Oconaluftee Cherokee in North Carolina, the Nantahala Cherokee who joined them, and two or three hundred married to whites). That summer (1839) a council to effect a union between the Old Settlers and the Late Immigrants convened at Double Springs in Indian Territory. It broke up sixteen days later without having reached an agreement when John Brown, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation–West, became frustrated with Ross's intransigence. The latter insisted that the Old Settlers accept him as Principal Chief over the united Nation without an election and recognize his absolute authority. Ross was easily elected in the following elections. Ross’s partisans blamed Brown’s actions on the Treaty Party, particularly those, such as the Ridge and Watie families, who had emigrated prior to the forced removal. They had settled with the Old Settlers. A group of these men targeted members of the Ridge faction for assassination, to enforce the Cherokee law (written by Major Ridge) making it a capital crime for any Cherokee to cede national land for private profit. There is no evidence, however, that John Ross supported or knew of their plans. The list of targets included Major Ridge, John Ridge, Elias Boudinot, Stand Watie, John A. Bell, James Starr, George Adair, and others. (Notably absent from the list were Treaty Party leaders David Vann, Charles Vann, John Gunter, Charles Foreman, William Hicks, and Andrew Ross. William Hicks died sometime before or in the year 1837. His death was before removal took place.) On 22 June 1839, teams ranging up to twenty-five in number converged on the houses of John Ridge, Major Ridge, and Elias Boudinot, and murdered them; their attempt on Stand Watie was unsuccessful. They did not attack any others, but the assassinations marked the beginning of the Cherokee Civil War; it continued until after the American Civil War. James Starr was also killed during this period. The Ross partisans forced the Old Settlers to give up their established political system and accept the majority vote and John Ross's authority. Ridge Party families fled Oklahoma and found refuge in what was then Nacogdoches County, Texas (in the area that later became known as the Mount Tabor Indian Community), near present-day Kilgore. Many of their descendants still live in the area along with the Thompson-McCoy Choctaws. == Later developments == In 2019, Cherokee Nation principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. cited a provision of the treaty that states that the Cherokee \\"shall be entitled to a delegate in the House of Representatives of the United States whenever Congress shall make provision for the same,\\" in announcing that he intended to appoint, for the first time, a Congressional delegate from the Cherokee Nation. Pending a decision of the Cherokee National Council, Hoskin said he would nominate Kimberly Teehee, a member of the Cherokee Nation who formerly served as a policy advisor in the administration of President Barack Obama, to the post. == See also == *Cherokee removal (Trail of Tears) *Timeline of Cherokee removal == Notes == == References == *Blankenship, Bob.

The mill was built in 1800 by order of Sir Rowland Blennerhassett and has two grinding couples with on the spindle a gear that is driven by the wheel with wooden combs. The grinding stones are French bir. The mill was used for milling grain, both for local people and for export to Great Britain. At the end of the 19th century the mill began to decay due to the rise of the steam engine, the salinisation of the river channel to Blennerville, the opening of the Tralee Ship Canal in 1846 and the construction of the Fenit harbor in 1880. In 1981 the town of Tralee in the Urban District Council buy the mill and began the restoration of the mill in June 1984. The restored mill was officially opened in 1990 by Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles Haughey. Nowadays again wheat is ground. The wooden windshaft has a one-ton stock housing cast. The mill has wings of 18.29 meters (60 feet) with wooden breast rods. The brake wheel and the crown wheel have a conical toothing with iron teeth. The winding mechanism is operated outside the mill with a jug chain over a sprocket. The small transmission makes the crossing very slow, 180 degrees of cross takes about two hours. The sack hoist has a conical wheel, which is driven under the crown wheel. On the now empty intermediate floor is tentering of the main shaft of douglas fir with an iron construction, which used to have a motor. Also here are the tentering of the grinding couples and the great spur wheel. There is also a visitor center with a craft center, model railways, art gallery, audio-visual presentation and restaurant. Guided tours with a guide are given in the mill.

Erimo is famous for its strong winds, kelp (konbu), and its scenic cape, Cape Erimo (Erimo- misaki). The cape was made famous by Shinichi Mori's enka song Erimo Misaki. It is supposed to be a romantic place to visit. The cape hosts a population of Kurile seals, as well as a museum dedicated to wind (kaze-no-yakata). Winds in Erimo are strong enough that in addition to two windmills on the cape, Erimo Elementary School (built in 2000) is completely powered by electricity generated by its own windmill. This is a common location in Hokkaido to view the first sunrise of the year, and hundreds of people from all over Japan brave the strong, cold wind to watch. While the main industry is fishing (salmon and squid in particular), Erimo's most famous harvest is kelp which is harvested by most of the native residents during the summer months. The kelp is sold in Japan as Hidaka konbu, and Erimo has a museum in the main part of town dedicated to kelp and fishery. The Hidaka Mountains come right down to the ocean at Erimo. For that reason, the road north to Hiroo had to be carved out of the rock. The road is known as the , because it cost so much to build. In March 2006, due to steady population decline, Erimo's Elementary and Junior High School along this road were closed, and students began busing into the main Junior High in the center of town. ==Events== Cape Erimo is a popular place for the first sunrise of the new year and visitors come not only from Hokkaido but all around Japan. Additionally, since the building of the Museum of the Wind, tourists can enjoy watching the sunrise from within the museum's \\"Theatre of the Wind\\". Mid-January holds the annual Pickling Competition. The housewives of Erimo battle in a competition of homemade pickles. The entrants compete for bragging rights with various pickles, such as sushi rice with pickled radish and sake lees, the locally produced salmon and sandfish.

The townspeople are promoting the creation of a rich forest by planting Sakhalin fir and pine every year. Thanks to the endeavors of projects such as this the area around Erimo has changed from a desert into a lush forest. Starting in mid-July kelp harvesting begins. Fishing and kelp harvesting are a major industry for Erimo and so from mid-July until September many townspeople assist the harvest in the early morning and then go on to their regular jobs. On a clear day following a rainy day, it is not uncommon for many people to take a day off work/school to assist the harvest. is held every August. Spectators can enjoy an array of performances of local entertainers and popular songs. However, the most highly anticipated festival event for residents of Erimo and the Hidaka area is the absolutely awe-inspiring display of fireworks.

He attended Cambridge University and learned the classics and five languages. He stated that he had been shipwrecked and wandered through South America for some time before he reached North America and Prescott, Arizona, in 1863. He told John G. Bourke that he had been born at Marseilles and that his family served in the diplomatic service. Having made friends with Jack Swilling and realizing the value of land, drilling, and canal building, he moved to the future site of Phoenix, Arizona, with Swilling in 1867.

He is buried at the small Pioneer and Military Memorial Park a few blocks from the state Capitol. ==Legacy== Duppa is recognized as one of the founders of Phoenix, Arizona, with his friend Swilling, and eventually built a ranch north of Phoenix. Phoenix was founded in 1868and incorporated in 1881, and the name proposed by Duppa came from the story of the mythical Phoenix's rebirth from the ashes.

Saeqeh aircraft were tested successfully in Iran 20 September 2007. ==Development== The first prototype of the jet was shown on state television making a test flight in July 2004. In that exercise, which began on August 19, 2006, the new fighter carried out actions described as \\"a mission to bomb virtual enemy targets\\" and \\"a mock bombing mission\\". Two prototypes, which appeared to differ from the one that had been shown previously, conducted a fly-past at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport on 20 September 2007. Three prototypes took part in a military parade on 22 September 2007. Iran has announced that it will test fly the other variants of the Saeqeh in the near future which will differ from the previous aircraft due to major changes in its weapon system, aerodynamics and operational range. In September 2010, Iran displayed the first squadron of Saeqeh fighter jets produced during an air show staged during the military parades at the beginning of the Iranian Sacred Defence Week according to the FARS News Agency. In May 2012 Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi stated that three new-generation Saeqeh fighters had been manufactured and delivered to the Air Force. On 26 August 2012, deputy Defence Minister Mohammad Eslami announced that an upgraded version of the Saeqeh would be introduced in the Iranian Air Force by the end of 2013. ==Design== Little information on the specifications of the Saeqeh has been released.

In the 6th century, the poet Senchán Torpéist gathered the poets of Ireland together to see if any of them knew the story of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, but they all only knew parts of it. His son Muirgen came to the grave of Fergus mac Róich and spoke a poem, and Fergus' ghost appeared to him and related the events of the Táin as they happened.Thomas Kinsella, \\"How the Táin Bó Cúailnge Was Found Again\\", The Táin, 1969, pp. 1–2 ==Legend== He was originally a man named Friuch, a pig- keeper, who worked for Bodb Dearg, king of the Munster sidh. He fell out with Rucht, who was a pig-keeper for Ochall Ochne, king of the Connaught sidh. The two fought, transforming into various animal and human forms, ultimately becoming two worms which were swallowed by two cows and reborn as two bulls, Donn Cuailnge and Finnbhennach (\\"White-horned\\"). Donn belonged to Dáire mac Fiachna, a cattle-lord of Ulster; Finnbhennach was born into the herds of queen Medb of Connacht, but considered belonging to a woman beneath him and joined the herds of her husband, Ailill. The Mórrígan had a heifer which she took to Cooley to be bulled by Donn. The result was a bull-calf which fought Finnbhennach and narrowly lost. After seeing that, Medb was determined to see Finnbhennach fight the bull-calf's sire. When Medb discovered that owning Finnbhennach made Ailill richer than her, she resolved to even the account by possessing Donn Cuailnge. She sent messengers to Dáire with an extremely generous offer of land and treasure, and if necessary sexual favours, if he would loan the bull to her for a year. Dáire agreed. However the messengers got drunk, and one boasted that if he hadn't agreed Medb would have taken the bull by force. When Dáire heard that he backed out of the deal. Medb raised an army to steal Donn, and marched on Ulster. As Fergus mac Róich knew the terrain he was chosen to lead. The Mórrígan, in the form of a crow, warned Donn of the coming army, and Donn Cuailnge goes on a rampage. The men of Ulster were intent on fighting Medb's army but were disabled by the curse of Cruinniuc's wife, Macha. The only person fit to defend Ulster is seventeen- year-old Cúchulainn but he lets the army take Ulster by surprise because he's off on a tryst when he should be watching the border. Medb ultimately tracked Donn Cuailnge down and he gores the first Connaught herdsman that attempts to capture him. He then stampeded with fifty heifers through the camp killing fifty warriors before charging off into the countryside.MacKillop, James. \\"Táin Bó Cúailnge\\", Myths and Legends of the Celts, Penguin UK, 2006 Cúchulainn meets Medb's army on the mount of Slieve Foy, who invoked the right of single combat at a ford, defeating a series of champions in a standoff lasting months. While Cúchulainn is thus engaged Buide mac Báin has found Donn Cuailnge and is driving him and twenty-four cows to Connaught. Cúchulainn kills Buide mac Báin and his twenty-four followers, but in the carnage Donn Cuailnge again runs off. Eventually, after a pitched battle with the Ulster forces, Medb's armies were forced to retreat, but they managed to bring Donn Cuailnge back to Cruachan. He and Finnbhennach fight. After a long and gruelling battle Donn killed his rival. Mortally wounded himself, he wandered around Ireland inspiring placenames before returning to Cooley to die. Julius Caesar, in his Gallic Wars, refers to a Gaulish ally called Valerius Donnotaurus, an interesting Celtic parallel to the Donn Tarbh of Cooley.\\"Donn Cuailnge\\", Oxford Index ==Versions== The oldest recension of the tale is found in the Lebor na hUidre (\\"The Book of the Dun Cow\\").

Wiśniewski (May 2, 1931 in Poland – February 28, 1994 in Tucson, Arizona, United States) was a Polish astronomer. Wisniewski was born and educated in Poland. He survived the Nazi occupation and many of his later insights and viewpoints may have grown from the hardships suffered during the war and the years afterwards. He began his career as a high school mathematics teacher before receiving his M.A. degree in astronomy from Poznan University in 1952 and his D.Sc. degree in astronomy from Jagiellonian University, Poland, in 1962. He joined the staff of the Cracow Observatory at Jagiellonian University as a research assistant in 1953. From 1957 to 1959, he participated as a Scientist of the International Geophysical Year Expedition to Spitsbergen. Wisniewski moved to the United States in 1963 to work as an astronomy professor at the newly founded Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson Arizona. Wisniewski returned to Poland in 1967, but eventually made his permanent home in Tucson, Arizona in 1971. His main interests were comets and asteroids. Wisniewski was heavily involved in astronomical photometry which he learned while working with Harold Johnson at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. His later years were occupied with observations of asteroids and comets, especially of the light-curves of small asteroids as well as taxonomic measurements of asteroids. At the time of his death, he was actively planning to participate in a network of telescopes to observe the impacts of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter. He had obtained one of the early high resolution images of the comet on March 28, 1993 while using the Steward Observatory 90 inch telescope. ==See also== * 2256 Wiśniewski, an asteroid named in his honour == References == ==External links== *Dictionary Of Minor Planet Names (Google Books) *Wiesław Z.

Four different models were available: a pickup truck, convertible, roadster and wagon. The Jeepster remained in production after American Motors Corporation (AMC) bought the Jeep line from Kaiser in 1970. After AMC's acquisition, the Jeepster Commando C101 (101\\" wheelbase) steadily grew in popularity. In 1972, AMC shortened the vehicle's name to Commando C104, extended the wheelbase to 104\\", and changed the front-end design to accept the AMC I6 and V8 304ci, similar to the Ford Bronco. The new configuration, formerly an AMC best seller, quickly caused the line to drop in popularity and was taken out of production in 1973; it was replaced with the full size Cherokee. The Jeepster is an ancestor of the modern Jeep family produced by Chrysler. There are several Jeepster enthusiast clubs across the United States. Willys-Overland, the original producers of the \\"Jeep\\" (originally manufactured for military use), also produced a \\"Jeepster\\" from 1948 until about 1950. This vehicle led to the later Kaiser productions. ==C101== The Jeepster was revived in 1966 as a 1967 model in the form of the Jeepster Commando (\\"C101\\"). The F-head Hurricane straight-4 was used (a direct descendant of the original Go Devil engine) and four-wheel drive was finally added. This engine produced at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm. The Dauntless V6 was optional and preferred with its of torque. A total of 57,350 Kaiser-spec \\"C101\\" Jeepster Commandos were sold between 1966 and 1971. Body styles of the Jeepster Commando included station wagon (with full-length metal hardtop), convertible, pickup, and roadster (with optional half- or full- length softtop). The deluxe station wagon included sliding rear windows and full interior trim—and available two-tone exterior.

Standard equipment included a Champagne White exterior with red and blue stripes, a roof rack, a sports steering wheel, and Goodyear G70 x 15 raised white letter tires mounted on wider steel wheels. Hurst equipment included special exterior insignia, an 8,000-rpm tachometer on the back of the hood scoop in the driver's line of sight, as well as a Hurst T-handle shifter on manual-transmission cars or a console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter with the optional automatic transmission. The Jeepster Commando came in three types: Revival Jeepster, Commando convertible, and an open body roadster with no top at all. The Revival Jeepster, named \\"Jeepster\\", as shown in hood side emblem an VIN decode or Jeepster Convertible was the showcase vehicle of the fleet, offering deluxe interior appointments, powered convertible top, and a Continental tire kit (available only for this model).

He inherited the title from his father on 29 April 1831. Clifford, eldest son of Charles Clifford, 6th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, and Eleanor Mary Arundell, daughter of Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour, was born in 1790. He was educated at the Roman Catholic college of Stonyhurst, and in 1814 attended Cardinal Consalvi to the Congress of Vienna. He served as a volunteer through a large portion of the Peninsular campaigns. On succeeding to his father's estates in 1831 he took his seat in the House of Lords. He gave his general support to the ministry of Lord Grey and afterwards of Lord Melbourne, but seldom took part in the debates except on questions connected with Roman Catholicism. In his later years he lived chiefly in Italy, where he had a house near Tivoli. He died at Rome on 28 February 1858 from an injury.

Berton. In spite of what the title might imply, this is more of a horror film than a child-friendly fantasy. The film stars Ernest Borgnine as a grandfather telling his grandson a story about the wizard Merlin opening up a store in modern-day America. He tells him two separate stories about Merlin and the store. == Plot == Although the opening segment implies that Merlin's magical interventions in people's lives are intended to have a benign effect, in practice this proves to be far from the case. The first story focuses on a married couple, Jonathan and Madeline Cooper. Jonathan is a respected, though obnoxious columnist, and Madeline is desperate for a baby, as she and Jonathan have been unable to conceive. The couple visit the store, where Jonathan berates Merlin and threatens to write a negative article in the newspaper that will cause his readers to avoid the store. Merlin loans Jonathan his spell book as proof that he is actually the legendary wizard. Jonathan takes the book home and begins to toy with several of the spells. Jonathan becomes convinced of the book's authenticity when an unsuccessful spell to summon a spirit results in him having a vision of Satan and causing Jonathan to breathe fire. Jonathan quickly grows excited and becomes obsessed with the book's powers, but begins to dramatically age due to the rapid depletion of one's life force required to cast the spells. Jonathan attempts to transform his pet cat into a mystical servant, but it becomes demonic and proceeds to attack him. Using the spell from earlier, Jonathan breathes fire and burns the cat alive. By then, Jonathan has aged so severely that his hair is white and receded. Jonathan retrieves the book's rejuvenation spell and proceeds to create the required potion. He takes a sample of Madeline's blood and adds it to the mixture. Jonathan drinks the potion, but the spell backfires: Jonathan regresses into infancy. Madeline happily decides to raise her former husband as her own child. In the second story, which bears a very close resemblance to Stephen King's short story \\"The Monkey\\", a thief steals a cymbal-banging- monkey toy from Merlin's shop, and sells it to a novelty store, where it is quickly bought as a present for a young boy. Every time the monkey's cymbals are struck, a nearby living thing dies. The boy's father takes the monkey and attempts to bury it, but it finds its way back into the boy's house. But before the monkey's cymbals are struck again, Merlin shows up and takes the toy back to his shop. ==Cast== *Ernest Borgnine - Grandfather *Mark Hurtado - Grandson ===First Subplot=== *George Milan - Merlin *Bunny Summers - Zurella *John Terrence - Jonathan Cooper III *Patricia Sansone - Madeline Cooper *Nicholas Noyes - Nicholas *Hillary Young - Nicholas' Mother *Julia Leigh Miller - Antique Store Clerk *Ben Sussman - Jake Cosgrove *Randy Chandler - Burglar *Richelle Hurtado - Baby ===The Devil's Gift=== *Bob Mendelsohn - David Andrews *Struan Robertson - Michael Andrews *Bruce Parry - Pete *Vicki Saputo - Susan *Madelon Phillips - Adrianne the Psychic *J.

Large elements of the original film's storyline are missing, and segments with Merlin are added to show him pursuing the toy monkey. The original film's dark ending, in which the monkey kills the entire family, is replaced with Merlin arriving just in time. == Mystery Science Theater 3000 version == The film was one of the last works to be featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000s original run (although its airing was delayed due to rights issues), the hosts and writers of which used the sloppy editing on the second subplot, the nigh-total disconnection between the two halves of the movie, and the wildly varying tone of the film (which is presented as though it were a family-friendly fantasy, but frequently features horrific incidents, something made even more disturbing by the fact that the halves of the film are stories that a grandfather is telling a little boy) as the basis for many of the jokes. For example, a wraparound segment depicted host Mike (Michael J. Nelson) and his robot companions taking a look at an (invented) range of Ernest Borgnine children's books, whose benign titles and presentation belied the frightful nature of the stories therein, with the exception of one which has a macabre appearance but features an innocent story. Another host segment depicted Mike turning into a baby due to his disbelief in magic. ==References* Category:1996 films Category:1996 horror films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Merlin Category:1990s fantasy films Category:Arthurian films ","title":"Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders"},{"id":"1439066","text":"Rudolph Martin Anderson (June 30, 1876 - June 21, 1961) was an American born Canadian zoologist and explorer. ==Early life== He was born in Decorah, Iowa in 1876, the son of John E.

He was known to hunt down and execute resistance fighters during World War II, as well as for his participation in anti-semitic programs, including the deportation of French Jews to Drancy and extermination camps. After his escape from France, he was convicted of war crimes and condemned to death. He was aided in entering Quebec, Canada in 1946 by leading Catholics of the province. In 1948 his true identity was discovered by immigration officials, who instituted deportation proceedings. De Bernonville fled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he lived the rest of his life. In 1957 the Supreme Court of Brazil refused to approve an extradition order. He was murdered by asphyxiation in 1972 by his servant's son. ==Early life and education== Count Jacques Dugé de Bernonville was born in Paris to an aristocratic family and educated in Jesuit schools. He became aligned with conservative political groups. ==Career== In 1938, he was imprisoned for several months, charged with having taken part in the conspiracy of La Cagoule, a far right terrorist group. He was released because of lack of proof. Following the 1940 defeat of France against Nazi Germany, Jacques de Bernonville joined the Vichy government. In 1943 he was appointed as a commander of the collaborationist Milice, the Vichy police. Working in conjunction with the head of the Milice Joseph Darnand, de Bernonville hunted down members of the French Resistance. They were almost always summarily executed. As a right-hand man to Klaus Barbie (later convicted for crimes against humanity), de Bernonville participated in the establishment and enforcement of the Vichy regime's program of anti-Semitic policies. They carried out the deportation of thousands of French Jews, refugee Jews and other \\"undesirables\\" to the Drancy deportation camp en route to Auschwitz and other German extermination camps. == Post-war escape to Canada == After the liberation of France by the Allied Forces, de Bernonville was charged with war crimes but fled the country. He was tried in absentia by a French War Crimes tribunal in Toulouse. There he was found guilty and condemned to death. Escaping French authorities in 1946, de Bernonville sailed to New York City. According to historians such as Kevin Henley, professor of history at Collège de Maisonneuve in Montreal, the politically powerful Roman Catholic priest Lionel Groulx helped de Bernonville get into Quebec. He was welcomed by a significant number of the Quebec nationalist elite, but in 1948 Canadian immigration authorities discovered his identity and instituted deportation proceedings. In an attempt to keep de Bernonville in Canada, 143 Quebec notables signed a 1950 petition defending him and stating that he should be allowed to stay. Signers included the secretary general of the Université de Montréal; Camillien Houde, mayor of the city of Montreal; plus Camille Laurin and Denis Lazure, two future cabinet ministers in the Parti Québécois government. Faced with a deportation order, de Bernonville fled again, going to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1954 the French government was advised of his location but, since Brazil had no extradition treaty with France, he escaped punishment. The Supreme Court of Brazil refused to extradite him in October 1957. Bernonville remained in Brazil. He died in 1972, murdered by the son of his servant. ==Further reading== *The Bernonville Affair: A French War Criminal in Quebec After World War II – Yves Lavertu (1995) original French edition: L'affaire Bernonville: Le Québec face à Pétain et à la Collaboration (1948-1951) (1994). *Unauthorized Entry: The Truth about Nazi War Criminals in Canada, 1946-1956 - Howard Margolian (2000) == See also == *Collaborationism *Pursuit of Nazi collaborators Category:1897 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Deaths from asphyxiation Category:French collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:French emigrants to Canada Category:French emigrants to Brazil Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:French military personnel of World War II Category:French people convicted of war crimes Category:French people murdered abroad Category:French police officers convicted of murder Category:French prisoners sentenced to death Category:People from Paris Category:People murdered in Brazil Category:People sentenced to death in absentia Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by France ","title":"Jacques de Bernonville"},{"id":"1439077","text":"Siamsa Tíre Theatre Siamsa Tíre (, meaning \\"entertainment of the land\\") is home to Ireland's National Folk Theatre and is located in Tralee Town Park, Tralee, County Kerry, Ireland. ==History and activities== Siamsa, pronounced \\"Shee-am-sa\\", comes from the Irish language.

In recent years, Siamsa Tíre has become increasingly involved in exploring new ways of interpreting folk culture, including a number of multidisciplinary projects incorporating contemporary dance, visual arts and site specific work. ===History=== The origins of Siamsa Tire date back to 1957 when a young curate, Fr Pat Ahern, was sent to Kerry to establish a new choir in St John's church in Tralee. The success of the choir and the talents of some of the members inspired Pat Ahern to stage a Passion Play entitled, Golgotha, in 1963. This performance met with such acclaim that a celebratory night was organised to acknowledge the performers and organisers. The night concluded with a special presentation of song, dance and music by some of those involved. This too was so warmly received that Pat Ahern and a number of others decided to continue to explore further possibilities for the informal group. They decided to call themselves, Siamsóirí na Ríochta. A core impetus for the group was the preservation of some of the traditions in music, song and dance in North Kerry that were in danger of disappearing. Chief among these was the ‘Munnix’ style of dancing as taught by the travelling dance master, Jeremiah Molyneaux, or Jerry Munnix as he was known. Many of the pieces included in the initial presentations focused on the Amhráin Saothar or work song which accompanied many of the traditional occupations and tasks in rural Ireland. Threshing, tending to animals, scything, churning, cobbling, along with festivals such as Bealtaine and Lughnasa formed the core of these productions. During these early years, Siamsóirí na Ríochta performed in a variety of venues in Ireland (including the Abbey Theatre) and abroad and were also invited to perform on a number of Raidio Telefís Éireann productions. In 1968, Michael Maye, a Bord Fáilte representative in Tralee, suggested that the group stage a season of productions during the summer. This was to be Siamsa Tíre's first Summer Season. Pat Ahern prepared a plan to foster the development of Irish folk culture in 1972 and in the ensuing years he proceeded to implement it. With the formation of Siamsa Tíre Teo in 1974, Pat Ahern was appointed Artistic Director, a position he held until his retirement in 1998. A vital element of Pat Ahern's plan was the fostering of traditional Irish folk culture in a series of Tithe Siamsa or Folk Academies located in strategic, tradition-rich parts of rural Ireland. The first of these was built in Finuge in North Kerry in 1974 and the second some years later in Carraig in the Chorcha Dhuibhne Gaeltacht. Here, training in music, dance, song and movement continues to be delivered to selected students over a period of three years, free of charge. Those students who show significant promise then graduate to an advanced class in Siamsa Tíre in Tralee, and from there to the Community Cast of the company. The other key individual in the development of Siamsa Tíre was Martin Whelan. Martin initially became involved in a voluntary capacity when the Teach Siamsa in Finuge was being built. His energy and commitment to this development lead him to take a more full-time role in the organisation and in 1974, he was appointed manager of Siamsa Tíre, a position he retained until his untimely death in 2002. At the time of his passing, Martin Whelan had become one of the best known and best loved arts administrators in the country. Martin, along with Pat Ahern and architect, Patrick O’Sullivan were instrumental in the building of the current theatre and arts centre in Tralee, travelling as far afield as the United States to study other arts facilities. The new theatre and arts centre was officially opened in 1991. Prior to this, Siamsa Tíre had a number of temporary homes, including the Ashe Memorial Hall and the old Theatre Royal in Tralee. The current theatre and arts centre is a testament to the vision of all three men and is still widely regarded as one of the best arts facilities in the country. Siamsa Tíre continues to play a central role in Irish cultural life, regionally and nationally. Tours abroad over the past 40 years have also contributed to a growing international reputation for the company. Siamsa Tíre continues to place a strong emphasis on development, working with visiting choreographers such as :Cindy Cummings, Catherine Young, Stacey Printz, Mary-Ellen McCarthy and Directors Jo Mangan, Brian Brady, John Sheehan and writer Michael Harding. “There is a sense in which we do not own our culture, we are only trustees. The treasure is only on loan and we must take it, refurbish it in the light of our experience and hand it on.\\" Fr Pat Ahern. == External links == * Siamsa Tíre website Category:1974 establishments in Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in County Kerry Category:Theatres in the Republic of Ireland Category:Tourist attractions in County Kerry Category:Tralee ","title":"Siamsa Tíre"},{"id":"1439082","text":"In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, Finnbhennach (\\"white-horned\\" sometimes rendered as \\"Whitehorn\\") was an extremely fertile stud bull owned by king Ailill of Connacht. He was originally one of Bodb Dearg's pig-keepers, who fell out with one of his colleagues. The two fought, taking a series of animal and human forms, before finally becoming two worms who were swallowed by two cows and reborn as two bulls, Finnbhennach and Donn Cuailnge. Finnbhennach was born into the herds of queen Medb, but thought belonging to a woman beneath him and joined her husband's herds instead. Donn Cuailnge was born into the herds of Dáire mac Fiachna of Cooley. He bulled a heifer belonging to the Mórrígan, and the resulting bull-calf fought Finnbhennach, and narrowly lost. After seeing that Medb was determined to see Finnbhennach fight the bull- calf's sire. When Medb discovered that owning Finnbhennach made Ailill richer than her, she resolved to even the account by possessing Donn Cuailnge. She launched the Táin Bó Cuailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley) and eventually brought Donn back to Cruachan. The two bulls fought. Finnbhennach was killed, Donn Cuailnge mortally wounded.

It was described as a farmer and fishery village and stood at first under Pomeranian, then Swedish and Prussian sovereignty. A beach hotel was built in 1895, marking the beginning of Zempin as a seaside resort. In 1911, Zempin railway connection was established, joined the German bath federation in 1928 and in 1933 a sea-bridge was established. Between 1943 and 1945 in the forest area between Zinnowitz and Zempin three launching sites of V1 cruise missiles were built for experimental purposes. Still today some remains are present. In 1956 a camping site was created and since 1990, Zempin has been nationally recognized as a seaside resort. ==References== ==External links== * Seebad Zempin (official German website) Category:Seaside resorts in Germany Category:Populated coastal places in Germany (Baltic Sea) Category:Vorpommern-Greifswald Category:Province of Pomerania (1815–1945) Category:Bezirk Rostock ","title":"Zempin"},{"id":"1439103","text":"Wug or WUG may refer to: * Wake Up, Girls!, a Japanese mixed-media project, consists of idol group/seiyuu unit and anime series * Wireless user group, a wireless network run by enthusiasts * Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft, the original title of Max Weber's magnum opus Economy and Society * Universiade (translated as World University Games), an international athletic event for university students * An imaginary creature depicted in the psycholinguistic investigative tool known as the Wug Test * , the State Mining Authority in Poland ","title":"Wug"},{"id":"1439106","text":"1921 Partition The Irish Question was the issue debated among, mainly, the British ruling classes from the early 19th century until the 1920s of how to respond to Irish nationalism and the calls for Irish independence. The phrase came to prominence as a result of the Acts of Union 1800 which merged the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and merged the Parliament of Ireland into a single governing body with the Parliament of Great Britain, the Parliament of the United Kingdom based in Westminster. Doing so forced the British political class to pay attention to the state of Ireland and its people. In 1844, a future British prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli, defined the Irish Question: In the United Kingdom general election of 1868, a coalition of Liberals and Irish Nationalists formed based on the fact that a wrong was done to Ireland and that it must be corrected. From the general election of 1868 to 1929, and most likely past the latter year, the Liberal Party's primary platform of reform was based on Irish reform. During the first ministry of William Ewart Gladstone, a total of 3 \\"grievances\\" were made to him by the Irish: \\"religious, agrarian, and nationalist\\". These were, but not limited to, the Roman Catholic faith being persecuted since the 16th century, the poverty wrought upon by legislation, such as Ireland's woolen industry, and English landlords, and \\"Poyning's Law\\", which held the Irish government's action subject to the acceptation of the government of England under Henry VII. In 1886, with the introduction of the first Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons, the term 'the Anglo-Irish Quarrel'The Anglo-Irish Quarrel: A Plea for Peace, John O'Connor Power, London, 1886 gained favour and became more acceptable than the implied condescension of 'the Irish Question'. Issues relating to Northern Ireland since the 1920s are often referred to as either \\"The Troubles\\" or \\"The Irish Problem\\". The Irish question affected British politics much the way that the nationalities problem affected Austria-Hungary. Normal British domestic issues could not be adequately addressed because of the political divisions created by the oppression of Ireland. The Liberal Party split over Home Rule, with the unionist faction leaving to create the Liberal Unionist Party, ceding control to the Conservatives, thus hurting the cause of further social and political reform. In 2017, the term was also used to describe issues associated with the UK-Irish border and Brexit. The term Irish border question has been used more widely in recent years. ==See also== * Armenian Question * German Question * Jewish question * Negro Question * Polish question * The Race Question == References == Category:History of Ireland (1801–1923) Category:19th century in the United Kingdom Category:National questions ","title":"Irish question"},{"id":"1439111","text":"Karlshagen is a Baltic Sea resort in Western Pomerania in the north of the island Usedom. Karlshagen has 3400 inhabitants and lies between Zinnowitz and Peenemünde. In 1885, a pier was developed in Karlshagen. Today it is the most important yachting port of Usedom. Between 1939 and 1945, Karlshagen lay in the restricted area of the army laboratory Peenemünde Army Research Center. Karlshagen also was the location of the housing development for high-level personnel and scientists working in the nearby laboratory. Although the buildings were largely destroyed in the air raids of 1943/44, some parts are preserved. From 1949 to 1989, Karlshagen belonged to the German Democratic Republic. During this period, the area north of Karlshagen, including the village Peenemuende, was a restricted-access area. The 75-metre-high pylons of a three-phase 110 kV alternating current overhead line running between Peenemuende and Karlshagen are visible for a considerable distance. This line was built in the early 1950s, in order to transport the electrical power generated on the island to the mainland, as it was no longer needed in Usedom after the laboratory was shut down. Later, a branch line was established to the transformer station in Karlshagen. After the Peenemuende power plant was shut down in 1990, the branch of the overhead line to the plant was dismantled, so now only the Karlshagen transformer station is fed by the line running across the Peene. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of Ostseebad Karlshagen (German) * Category:Seaside resorts in Germany Category:Populated coastal places in Germany (Baltic Sea) Category:Vorpommern- Greifswald Category:Bezirk Rostock ","title":"Karlshagen"},{"id":"1439115","text":"Edinburgh Athletic Football Club were a Scottish football team based in Edinburgh.

When the monastery was dissolved in 1563, Tzys reverted to Pomerania. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, in 1648, the island of Usedom on which Zinnowitz is situated fell to Sweden, which changed the town's name to Zitz. In the middle of the 18th century, Zitz became part of Prussia. In 1751 the town was renamed Zinnowitz. When the Prussian state fell into financial need because of the Napoleonic Wars, it sold Zinnowitz to a businessman, the merchant F. W. Krause of nearby Swinemünde, who in turn sold it in 32 parcels it to a group of colonists. In June 1851 Zinnowitz was designated an official spa.Meyers Reisebuch Deutsche Ostseeküste, II.

Their original products were accordions that they initially imported from Germany and then Italy before opening their own facility in 1932. During the late 1950s, the company started making electric guitars and later amplifiers. The early guitars were heavily influenced by the accordion production and had a special look and feel. Hagström were the first company to mass-produce 8 string bass guitars as well as the first to build a guitar/synthesizer hybrid (Swede Patch 2000). The company ceased production in 1983. In 2004 the brand was resurrected and is now in production in China. In 2008 Hagström expanded their line of products and launched their own line of basses including a re-issue of their famous Hagström H8, an 8 string bass. ==Accordions 1925 to 1970== Albin Hagström began importing accordions from Germany and Italy in 1925 and founded \\"Firma Albin Hagström\\". Albin expanded his business with shops in Sweden, Norway and Denmark and in 1932 he started manufacturing accordions himself in Älvdalen. In 1936, Hagström hired two Italian accordion builders who helped to update and streamline the manufacturing process. In 1939 Hagström started to establish themselves in USA by opening \\"Hagstrom Music Company Inc.\\" in Rockefeller Center in New York as well as \\"Albin Hagstrom Inc.\\" in Jamestown. However, in 1940 the launch was canceled due to World War II and the people hired to run the company disappeared with the company's funds. In 1946 Sven Hillring was sent over from Sweden to oversee a new launch of the new accordion factory in Jamestown, which was in business until 1949. Back in Sweden the brand continued to grow throughout the 1940s and 1950s and at one time had a total of forty-eight shops in northern Europe. In 1953 the accordion production reached its peak with 15,000 units being built. At this time the company also started a number of accordion schools; it is estimated that over 70,000 people have attended these schools. Founder Albin Hagström died in 1952 at the age 47 and was succeeded by Erik Wisén. In 1968 the Super Cromatic was introduced which came to be the last accordion built, with the last one made in 1970. In 1984 the company returned to its roots by once again importing accordions from Germany and Italy. The shops were sold, and employees were encouraged to venture out on their own, which resulted in two new companies in Älvdalen. Musitech was started by Hagstrom and sold to Rolf Lindhamn, who was the official Swedish retailer of Aria and Guild guitars. Per-Åke Olsson who participated in the development of the Super Swede founded Amtech which is producing PA systems and light rigs as well as computer equipment. The original \\"AB Albin Hagström\\" company still exists to this day and still owns many of the facilities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. === Hagströms Accordions === * 1930s ** Excellent - The first accordions manufactured by Hagström.. ** Granesso * 1940s ** 389-31 ** \\"Granesso 70 ** Accordia Superior and Extra * 1950s ** Castello\\" and Minor - Built in Italy. ** Skandia ** 773 and 813 ** Constellation, Marita and Rosella ** Master 4/5 ** Rigoletto I, II and III ** Rosita I and II ** Consul Maestro and Maestoso ** Constella II and Estrella ** Accordia Royal ** \\"Diana\\" Prod in Älvdalen ca 1955-1960. * 1960s ** Walter Special 40 - Named after Andrew Walter, well-known contemporary accordionist. ** Super Cromatic - The last accordion manufactured, widely considered to be one of the best accordions available. ==Guitars: 1958 to 1983== Kent II made in 1964 and a HIIN OT made in 1975 In 1958, Swedish-based Hagström started manufacturing electric guitars, being one of the first to produce the instrument professionally outside of the United States. The early Hagström Deluxe solid body guitars featured a distinctive sparkle and pearloid celluloid finish that was previously used on their line of accordions. Soon Hagström expanded their line-up of guitars to include hollow bodies like the Viking and the Jimmy. In 1961 the first line of Hagström basses was available to the public, this eventually came to include the groundbreaking 8 string bass. Models of electric guitar included the Hagström 1, the H series (h II, h III, h II N), the Swede (Originally called The Hagström LP, or Les Paul, due to the instrument's resemblance to the popular Les Paul manufactured by Gibson Guitars), the Super Swede, the Impala, the Corvette (called the Condor in the US), the Viking, the Swede Patch 2000 (one of the first synthesizer guitars) and the Jimmy (named for Jimmy D'Aquisto, a respected New York luthier brought in by Hagström to design the guitar). Basses include The Swede Bass and the Hagström H8 - the first ever mass-produced eight stringed bass guitar, which found fame when used by the likes of Noel Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Mike Rutherford, and others. Another innovation was the H-Expander Truss Rod, which gives the neck extra strength and allows it to be extra thin as well as allows the action to be set extra low. Beside their line of instruments Hagström also produced amplifiers, speakers, effects units, guitar strings and mixing consoles, which were used by ABBA on their first world tour. A very small run of lap steels, banjos and mandolins were also built but are rare to come across. In 1962 Albin's son, Karl-Erik Hagström returned from working five years in the US with establishing their Line O guitars. In 1967 he took over as CEO of the company. In their native Sweden, the company became well known not only for selling music hardware, but also for \\"teach-yourself\\" books and mail courses on electric guitar, bass, keyboards etc., learning tools that deliberately took in a rock and pop repertory, chord analysis and tuning apart from teaching how to read music. By recognizing the electric guitar as an instrument in its own right, and not just an amped-up version of the acoustic and by accepting the new repertory, Hagström popularized the instrumental skills of the new music outside of the networks associated with rock clubs, and record shops, and at a time when rock music was barely ever being written about from a musical perspective. Production ended for Swedish-made Hagströms in 1983 as the company were outpriced by other major guitar brands that had moved their stock production lines to Asia. Hagström did make some Japanese prototypes; however, they were not pleased with the workmanship and would rather close down the company than cheapen the brand. The interest in the original Hagström brand still has a cult following around the world and a Hagström Festival takes place in Älvdalen, Sweden around the first week of June every year since 2006. ===Hagström Guitars=== A vintage Hagström leaning against a Hagström amplifier combo * Standard, DeLuxe and DeLuxe A, 1958–1962 - Sold in America under the name Goya (not to be confused with Goya guitars, acoustic guitars by Levin).

They are marketing new versions of a great number of the more famous models from Sweden. The official Hagström design team have taken certain liberties with the designs and made some improvements and other deviations from the original Swedish designs. Hagström has again started the production of more exclusive Hagstrom guitars within Europe, which have been specially developed to reproduce the sounds of the originals. These models are called the Northen Series. ===Current Hagström Guitars=== * Deluxe D2H and Deluxe-F D2F. The Deluxe models come with two humbuckers and are single cutaway guitars. They have simple wiring with two potentiometers for master volume and tone control. These models were some of the first made when manufacturing resumed in 2004; however, they are no longer in production. The shape and dimensions of the D2H appear to have been based on that of the early [1958-62] pearloid-covered models such as the Standard 80 [pictured]. * Deuce and Deuce-F. The Deuce models come with two humbuckers and are dual cutaway guitars, where Hagstrom claims that these are siblings based upon the Super Swede model. Both guitars have independent push/pull tone pots for coil splitting each individual pickup. *Fantomen. The Fantomen models come with two humbuckers and are asymmetrical in design closely resembling the Gibson RD. The models come with two volume and two push/pull tone pots. The Fantomen was designed in collaboration with Ghost (Swedish band). *RetroScape. Hagstrom’s RetroScape Series consist of authentically recreated guitars from Hagstrom's history. The intention being to bring modern playability to these great designs without compromising any of the retro-vibe. There are two ranges of guitars: the 3-pickup Condor (& its 2-pickup sister the Impala) and the 3-pickup H-iii (along with 2-pickup H-ii). All of these feature modified headstocks from the 1960s originals as well as an upgraded bridge and re-engineered “Vintage Tremar” vibrato for functional improvement. * UltraLux Series XL-5 and Ultralux Series XL-2. The XL-5 comes with two humbuckers and one single coil pickup, the XL-2 is identical except it lacks the single coil pickup. Equipped with the FCS-2 bridge system. * UltraLux Series Ultra Swede. Comes with a coil tap switch that gives the humbucker pickups a single coil sound when tapped. Also includes \\"Custom 62\\" pickups being considered a more aggressive and hot set of pickups.

Pat Smear is known for having one of the largest Hagström collections in America and reportedly claimed that Hagströms are the most roadworthy guitars he's ever used. The world's largest collection of Hagström guitars was previously owned by Arne Johansson in Östersund, Sweden and consisted of more than 80 Hagström guitars plus a number amplifiers and other instruments and Hagström products. The entire collection was bought by the publicly owned museum of the Dalarna province, that owned a smaller collection of instruments, on 4 May 2012. Their collection now consists of more than 100 Hagström guitars. The red Viking II that Elvis Presley used on Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special was sold in the early nineties for more than $50,000 and was on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A 1981 Super Swede with custom blue and yellow graphics was sold for 60,100 Swedish kronor (approx. $8,850 USD), making it one of the most expensive Hagströms ever sold.

His visual style is distinctive in its use of primitive, often skeletal figures and minimalist backgrounds. Mulloy has made over 30 animated films many of which are in themed groupings based on Hollywood genres. Mulloy has won many international awards for his work and has conducted several workshops for young animators. ==Early life== Mulloy was born in Wallasey to an Irish father, Michael Mulloy, who migrated to Liverpool to work on the docks and an English mother named Elizabeth. ==Education== Mulloy studied painting at Ravensbourne College followed by film at the Royal College of Art graduating in 1973.

Casement was involved in an attempt to land arms for Irish Republicans from the German vessel the Aud. A monument for Casement and another man, Robert Monteith, stands near the dunes with the inscription: \\"At a spot on Banna beach adjacent to here Roger Casement - Humanitarian & Irish revolutionary leader - Robert Monteith & a third man came ashore from a German submarine on Good Friday morning 21 April 1916 in furthering the cause of Irish freedom.\\" The mysterious 'third man' was Daniel Julian Bailey, a soldier in the Royal Irish Rifles in the British army who when a POW was recruited (as Daniel Beverley) into the 'Casement Brigade'. The monument was erected in 1966 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the landing. A decision was taken by the 1966 Banna Strand committee to deliberately omit the name of the \\"third man\\" from the monument because, following his capture, he turned \\"King's evidence.\\" The sod was turned, for the construction of the monument, by Florrie Monteith, the daughter of Robert Monteith.

Technoscience is the study of how humans interact with technology using the scientific method. \\"Technoscience.\\". “Technoscience.” Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, Encyclopedia.com, 2019, www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/technoscience. Technoscience thus comprises the history of human application of technology and modern scientific methods, ranging from the early development of basic technologies for hunting, agriculture, or husbandry (e.g. the well, the bow, the plow, the harness) and all the way through atomic applications, biotechnology, robotics, and computer sciences. This more common and comprehensive usage of the term technoscience can be found in general textbooks and lectures concerning the history of science. An alternate, more narrow usage occurs in some philosophic science and technology studies. In this usage, technoscience refers specifically to the technological and social context of science. Technoscience recognises that scientific knowledge is not only socially coded and historically situated but sustained and made durable by material (non-human) networks. Technoscience states that the fields of science and technology are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. The latter, philosophic use of the term technoscience was popularized by French philosopher Gaston Bachelard in 1953.Gaston Bachelard, La materialisme rationel, Paris: PUF, 1953.Don Ihde, Expanding Hermeneutics: Visualism in Science, Northwestern University Press, 1999, p. 8.James M. M. Good, Irving Velody, The Politics of Postmodernity, Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 178. It was popularized in the French-speaking world by Belgian philosopher Gilbert Hottois in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and entered English academic usage in 1987 with Bruno Latour's book Science in Action.Bruno Latour (1987). Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society. Harvard University Press. In translating the concept to English, Latour also combined several arguments about technoscience that had circulated separately within science and technology studies (STS) before into a comprehensive framework: # the intertwinement of scientific and technological development as e.g. shown by the lab studies; # the power of laboratories (and engineering workshops) to change the world as we know and experience it; # the seamless webs that connect scientists, engineers and societal actors in actual practice (cf. John Law's concept of heterogeneous engineering); # the propensity of technoscientific world to create new nature–culture hybrids, and hence to complicate the borders between nature and culture. ==Conceptual levels of philosophical technoscience== We look at the concept of technoscience by considering three levels: a descriptive-analytic level, a deconstructivist level, and a visionary level. ===Descriptive- analytic=== On a descriptive-analytic level, technoscientific studies examine the decisive role of science and technology in how knowledge is being developed. What is the role played by large research labs in which experiments on organisms are undertaken, when it comes to a certain way of looking at the things surrounding us? To what extent do such investigations, experiments and insights shape views of 'nature' and of human bodies? How do these insights link to the concept of living organisms as biofacts? To what extent do such insights inform technological innovation? Can the laboratory be understood as a metaphor for social structures in their entirety? ===Deconstructive=== On a deconstructive level, theoretical work is being undertaken on technoscience to address scientific practices critically, e.g. by Bruno Latour (sociology), by Donna Haraway (history of science), and by Karen Barad (theoretical physics). It is pointed out that scientific descriptions may be only allegedly objective; that descriptions are of a performative character, and that there are ways to de-mystify them. Likewise, new forms of representing those involved in research are being sought. ===Visionary=== On a visionary level, the concept of technoscience comprises a number of social, literary, artistic and material technologies from western cultures in the third millennium. This is undertaken in order to focus on the interplay of hitherto separated areas and to question traditional boundary-drawing: this concerns the boundaries drawn between scientific disciplines as well as those commonly upheld for instance between research, technology, the arts and politics. One aim is to broaden the term 'technology' (which by the Greek etymology of 'techné' connotes all of the following: arts, handicraft, and skill) so as to negotiate possibilities of participation in the production of knowledge and to reflect on strategic alliances. Technoscience can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in these recent years such as technoetic, technoethics and technocriticism. ==Facets== ===Social=== As with any subject, technoscience exists within a broader social context that must be considered. Science & Technology Studies researcher Sergio Sismondo argues, \\"Neither the technical vision nor the social vision will come into being without the other, though with enough Concerted Effort both may be brought into being together\\". Despite the frequent separation between innovators and the consumers, Sismondo argues that development of technologies, though stimulated by a technoscientific themes, is an inherently social process. Technoscience is so deeply embedded in people's everyday lives that its developments exist outside a space for critical thought and evaluation, argues Daniel Lee Kleinman (2005). Those who do attempt to question the perception of progress as being only a matter of more technology are often seen as champions of technological stagnation. The exception to this mentality is when a development is seen as threatening to human or environmental well-being. This holds true with the popular opposition of GMO crops, where the questioning of the validity of monopolized farming and patented genetics was simply not enough to rouse awareness.Klienmen, Daniel Lee. Science and Technology in Society: From Biotechnology to the Internet. Blackwell Pub, 2005 ===Political=== Science and technology are tools that continually change social structures and behaviors. Technoscience can be viewed as a form of government or having the power of government because of its impact on society. The impact extends to public health, safety, the environment, and beyond.Langdon Winner, The Whale and the Reactor: The Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986) Innovations create fundamental changes and drastically change the way people live. For example, C-SPAN and social media give American voters a near real-time view of Congress. This has allowed journalists and the people to hold their elected officials accountable in new ways. ===Environmental=== Chlorine chemists and their scientific knowledge helped set the agenda for many environmental problems: PCBs in the Hudson River are polychlorinated biphenols;\\"Hudson River PCBs — Background and Site Information\\". United States Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 2007-12-31. http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm DDT, dieldrin, and aldrin are chlorinated pesticides; CFCs that deplete the ozone layer are chlorofluorocarbons. Industry actually manufactured the chemicals and consumers purchased them. Therefore, one can determine that chemists are not the sole cause for these issues, but they are not blameless.Woodhouse, Edward. The Future of Technological Civilization.

It was designed with the German police forces in mind, who sought to replace existing 7.65mm pistols with a modern service sidearm incorporating enhanced safety features and chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. A subsequent bid resulted in the Walther P5 being introduced into service alongside the SIG Sauer P225 (designated P6 within the West German Federal Police) and Heckler & Koch P7. ==Design details== The pistol incorporates many new design features, including a new aluminum alloy frame, trigger mechanism, dual-control mechanism, firing pin safety (US patent number 4313274 dated 1979, authored by Walter Ludwig). The Walther P5 is a recoil-operated, locked-breech, 9 mm semi-automatic pistol. It utilizes the same design principles as the Walther P38 pistol of World War II fame. The barrel does not tilt following firing in the way that Browning's system does, but rather moves straight back approximately . This system results in a very accurate pistol since the barrel is kept parallel with the frame during/after firing. The trigger is a standard double- action/single-action trigger. The slide lock also doubles as the decocker and is found on the left side of the frame. Pressing it once will release the slide, pressing it a second time will safely de-cock the hammer. Manufactured in Ulm, West Germany, by Carl Walther Sportwaffen GmbH, the P5 was a further development of the famous Walther P38 and P1 series. Development began following requests by German police and federal agencies for a new sidearm. Walther engineers decided to use the P1 model as the basis of the P5 and gave it a similar locking system, reinforced frame, and dual recoil springs. In addition, the Walther improved the extractor, shortened the barrel, and increased the slide length. Safety was enhanced by utilizing an innovative pivoting firing pin that can move forward only when the trigger is pulled. In addition, the P1's slide-mounted decocker/safety was moved to a frame mounted decocker/slide stop multi-lever. Unlike most modern semi-automatic pistols, the P5 ejects spent casings to the left. This may make it a more attractive firearm for left-handed shooters. ==Variants== ===Walther P5 Compact=== Walther P5 Compact The Walther P5 Compact is the shorter and lighter version of the full-size P5. Approx 6,500 units were made for the commercial market with the \\"P5 Compact\\" slide marking. ===Walther P5 Lang=== Walther P5 Lang Walther P5 Lang - also known as P5L - is a variant with an extended barrel whose shape is reminiscent of that of the P38. ==Reception== Although the P5's successful and functional design and high level of functional reliability were confirmed by experts, there was no great sales success within Germany nor for export. As such, while successor of the P38, the P5's popularity limited compared to its predecessor. Reason for this is believed to be its high asking price, as at that time, Walther's products, not just P5, were significantly more expensive than products from other manufacturers. And so, only few law enforcement outfits, let alone civilians, could afford to acquire it.Chris McNab, Handfeuerwaffen des 20. und 21. Jahrhunderts, Neuer Kaiser Verlag, Neuauflage von 2009 Domestically, only the police of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate procured the standard model in 9x19mm between 1976-1979. The compact version were issued to few criminal police departments in Baden- Württemberg. Due to pricing, the SIG Sauer P225 generally outbid Walther P5 in the domestic law enforcement sales.Chris McNab, Handfeuerwaffen des 20. und 21. Jahrhunderts, Neuer Kaiser Verlag, Neuauflage von 2009 3,000 units of Walther P5 Compact were adopted in the 1980s by the British Army as Pistol L102A1 and were marked as such with the British military model number on the left side and NATO number on the right side instead of the standard Walther model markings. They were issued to the Royal Irish Regiment (Home Service) as a Personal Protection Weapon, also a small number may have been issued to 14 Intelligence Company, a unit active in Northern Ireland.

The key distinguishing feature is the absence of external authority to establish rules enforcing cooperative behavior. In the absence of external authority (such as contract law), players cannot group into coalitions and must compete independently. == Analysis == Non-cooperative games are generally analysed through the framework of non-cooperative game theory, which tries to predict players' individual strategies and payoffs and to find Nash equilibria. It is opposed to cooperative game theory, which focuses on predicting which groups of players (\\"coalitions\\") will form, the joint actions that groups will take, and the resulting collective payoffs. Cooperative game theory does not analyze the strategic bargaining that occurs within each coalition and affects the distribution of the collective payoff between the members. Non-cooperative game theory provides a low-level approach as it models all the procedural details of the game, whereas cooperative game theory only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions. Non-cooperative game theory is in this sense more inclusive than cooperative game theory. It is also more general, as cooperative games can be analyzed using the terms of non- cooperative game theory. Where arbitration is available to enforce an agreement, that agreement falls outside the scope of non-cooperative theory: but it may be possible to state sufficient assumptions to encompass all the possible strategies players may adopt, in relation to arbitration. This will bring the agreement within the scope of non-cooperative theory. Alternatively, it may be possible to describe the arbitrator as a party to the agreement and model the relevant processes and payoffs suitably. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework. But in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process; or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers. == See also == * Assured destruction * Grim trigger * Intra-household bargaining * Nash equilibrium * Proper equilibrium * Tit for tat * Trembling hand perfect equilibrium * Trigger strategy * War of attrition (game) * Zero-sum game == References == == External links == * A brief introduction to non-cooperative game theory * An Introductory Course in Noncooperative Game Theory (requires password) * Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics) it:Teoria dei giochi#Giochi non cooperativi ","title":"Non-cooperative game theory"},{"id":"1439244","text":"The Searles Castle is located in Windham, New Hampshire, in the United States. Edward Francis Searles commissioned its design and construction. Construction began in 1905 and was completed in 1915. It was intended to be a 1/4-scale replica of the medieval Tudor manor of Stanton Harcourt in Oxfordshire, England, but since most of the manor had been torn down in the 18th century, the castle bears little resemblance to the historical structure.Headley, Gwyn (1996). Architectural Follies in America, pp. 71–72. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ==History and construction== Searles hired architect Henry Vaughan to design Searles Castle. It is built of cut granite, fieldstone, and dark red sandstone, most of which came from Searles' own quarries in Pelham, New Hampshire. The castle is situated high atop the Searles estate. The cost of construction was about $1,250,000. The castle consists of an entrance, a reception hall, a foyer, a dining room, a music room, a sun porch, a library, a grand stairway, a second floor guest suite, a third floor guest suite, a second floor rotunda (or balcony), servants' rooms, a kitchen, a butler's pantry, butlers' rooms, and a master bedroom suite which consists of a master bedroom, a sitting room, a bathroom, and a sun room. ==Later ownership== When Searles died on August 6, 1920, he left the castle to his executive secretary, Arthur T. Walker. When Mr. Walker died seven years later, he left the castle to his niece, Iva C. McEachern, who sold it to real estate broker Frank M. Andrew in 1930 for $2,000,000. Mr. and Mrs. Andrew lived in the castle from 1943 to 1952, at which time it was sold to the Religious Order of the Sisters of Mercy. For a while, they used it as a novitiate for young women who were entering the Sisters of Mercy. From 1962 to the mid-1980s, classes were held in the castle. Due to water damage and other problems, the castle was closed for about five years. The roof was replaced, and in 1990 the decision was made to reopen the castle. ==Current uses== In 1991, in an effort to restore the interior of the castle, a \\"Decorators' Showcase\\" was held. Through the generosity of those interior designers and contributions received over the years from many benefactors, the interior of the building has been refurbished. Since that time, the castle has been available to the public for social, cultural, religious, and business events. In November 2001, the Sisters of Mercy contracted David and Linda Kolifrath of Salem, New Hampshire, to organize and manage events held at the castle. At this time it was decided that operations would be expanded to include weddings and receptions in the castle courtyard in an effort to better utilize the facility, better serve the needs of the public, and to raise additional funds to further the charitable programs of the Sisters of Mercy. The property, along with several surrounding properties, sold in February 2019 to a California pharmaceutical company owner for $3.4 million. ==References== Category:Castles in the United States Category:Houses in Rockingham County, New Hampshire Category:Windham, New Hampshire ","title":"Searles Castle (New Hampshire)"},{"id":"1439263","text":"James John Lange (; August 15, 1932 – February 25, 2014) was an American game show host and disc jockey.

The most obvious developments have been procedures developed to allow anastomosis of successively smaller blood vessels and nerves (typically 1 mm in diameter) which have allowed transfer of tissue from one part of the body to another and re-attachment of severed parts. Microsurgical techniques are utilized by several specialties today, such as: general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, gynecological surgery, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery and pediatric surgery. ==History== Otolaryngologists were the first physicians to use microsurgical techniques. A Swedish otolaryngologist, Carl- Olof Siggesson Nylén (1892–1978), was the father of microsurgery. In 1921, in the University of Stockholm, he built the first surgical microscope, a modified monocular Brinell-Leitz microscope. At first he used it for operations in animals. In November of the same year he used it to operate on a patient with chronic otitis who had a labyrinthine fistula. Nylen's microscope was soon replaced by a binocular microscope, developed in 1922 by his colleague Gunnar Holmgren (1875–1954). Gradually the operating microscope began to be used for ear operations. In the 1950s many otologists began to use it in the fenestration operation, usually to perfect the opening of the fenestra in the lateral semicircular canal. The revival of the stapes mobilization operation by Rosen, in 1953, made the use of the microscope mandatory, although it was not used by the originators of the technique, Kessel (1878), Boucheron (1888) and Miot (1890). Mastoidectomies began to be performed with the surgical microscope and so were the tympanoplasty techniques that became known in the early 1950s. The stapes mobilization operation had varying results and was soon replaced by stapedectomy, first described by John Shea, Jr.; this was an operation that was always performed with the microscope. Today neurosurgeons are very proud to use microscopes in their procedures. But it was not always so: many prestigious centers did not accept that idea and it had to be developed in relative isolation. In the late 1950s William House began to explore new techniques for temporal bone surgery. He developed the middle fossa approach and perfected the translabyrinthine approach and began to use these techniques to remove acoustic nerve tumors. The first neurosurgeon to make use of the surgical microscope was a Turkish emigrant, Gazi Yasargil. In 1953 he studied neurovascular surgery during work with Prof. Hugo Krayenbühl in Switzerland. His ideas interested Dr. Pete Donaghy, who invited Yasargil to his microvascular laboratory in Burlington, Vermont. After his return to Zürich in 1967 Yasargil concentrated on discovering clinical applications to their novel inventions.Tew, John M. Jr M. Gazi Yasargil:Neurosurgery's Man of the Century. Neurosurgery 45(5):1010, November 1999 Publications on that topic: Micro-Vascular SurgeryDonaghy RMP, Yasargil MG (eds) Micro-Vascular Surgery: Report of First Conference, October 6–7, 1966, Mary Fletcher Hospital, Burlington, Vermont. Stuttgart, Georg Thieme, 1967 and Microsurgery Applied to NeurosurgeryYasargil MG Microsurgery Applied to Neurosurgery. Stuttgart, Georg Thieme, 1969. won him international recognition. His lifelong experiences with microsurgery were recapitulated in the four-volume textbook entitled simply Microneurosurgery.Yasargil MG: Microneurosurgery Stuttgart, Georg Thieme, 1984-1996, volumes I-IVB The advances in the techniques and technology that popularized microsurgery began in the early 1960s to involve other medical areas. The first microvascular surgery, using a microscope to aid in the repair of blood vessels, was described by vascular surgeon, Julius H. Jacobson II of the University of Vermont in 1960. Using an operating microscope, he performed coupling of vessels as small as 1.4 mm and coined the term microsurgery. Hand surgeons at the University of Louisville (KY), Drs. Harold Kleinert and Mort Kasdan, performed the first revascularization of a partial digital amputation in 1963. A podiatrist prepares for microsurgery. Nakayama, a Japanese cardiothoracic surgeon, reported the first true series of microsurgical free-tissue transfers using vascularized intestinal segments to the neck for esophageal reconstruction after cancer resections using 3–4 mm vessels. Contemporary reconstructive microsurgery was introduced by an American plastic surgeon, Dr. Harry J. Buncke. In 1964, Buncke reported a rabbit ear replantation, famously using a garage as a lab/operating theatre and home-made instruments. This was the first report of successfully using blood vessels 1 millimeter in size. In 1966, Buncke used microsurgery to transplant a primate's great toe to its hand. During the late sixties and early 1970s, plastic surgeons ushered in many new microsurgical innovations that were previously unimaginable. The first human microsurgical transplantation of the second toe to thumb was performed in February 1966 by Dr. Dong-yue Yang and Yu-dong Gu, in Shanghai, China. Great toe (big toe) to thumb was performed in April 1968 by Dr. John Cobbett, in England. In Australia work by Dr. Ian Taylor saw new techniques developed to reconstruct head and neck cancer defects with living bone from the hip or the fibula. A number of surgical specialties use microsurgical techniques. Otolaryngologists (ear, nose, throat and head and neck surgeons) perform microsurgery on structures of the inner ear and the vocal cords. Otolaryngologists and maxillofacial surgeons use microsurgical techniques when reconstructing defects from resection of head and neck cancers. Cataract surgery, corneal transplants, and treatment of conditions like glaucoma are performed by ophthalmologists. Urologists and gynecologists frequently now reverse vasectomies and tubal ligations to restore fertility. ==Free tissue transfer== Free tissue transfer is a surgical reconstructive procedure using microsurgery. A region of \\"donor\\" tissue is selected that can be isolated on a feeding artery and vein; this tissue is usually a composite of several tissue types (e.g., skin, muscle, fat, bone). Common donor regions include the rectus abdominis muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle, fibula, radial forearm bone and skin, and lateral arm skin. The composite tissue is transferred (moved as a free flap of tissue) to the region on the patient requiring reconstruction (e.g., mandible after oral cancer resection, breast after cancer resection, traumatic tissue loss, congenital tissue absence). The vessels that supply the free flap are anastomosed with microsurgery to matching vessels (artery and vein) in the reconstructive site. The procedure was first done in the early 1970s and has become a popular \\"one-stage\\" (single operation) procedure for many surgical reconstructive applications. Image:footwound.JPGTraumatic foot/ankle soft tissue wound from motor vehicle accident Image:footwound2.JPGAnterio-lateral thigh flap free-tissue transfer reconstruction ==Replantation== Replantation is the reattachment of a completely detached body part. Fingers and thumbs are the most common but the ear, scalp, nose, face, arm and penis have all been replanted. Generally replantation involves restoring blood flow through arteries and veins, restoring the bony skeleton and connecting tendons and nerves as required. Robert Malt and Charles Mckhann reported the first replantation two human upper extremities by microvascular means in 1964 with the first arm replanted in a child after a train injury in 1962 in Boston. Initially, when the techniques were developed to make replantation possible, success was defined in terms of a survival of the amputated part alone. However, as more experience was gained in this field, surgeons specializing in replantation began to understand that survival of the amputated piece was not enough to ensure success of the replant. In this way, functional demands of the amputated specimen became paramount in guiding which amputated pieces should and should not be replanted. Additional concerns about the patients ability to tolerate the long rehabilitation process that is necessary after replantation both on physical and psychological levels also became important. So, when fingers are amputated, for instance, a replantation surgeon must seriously consider the contribution of the finger to the overall function of the hand. In this way, every attempt will be made to salvage an amputated thumb, since a great deal of hand function is dependent on the thumb, while an index finger or small finger might not be replanted, depending on the individual needs of the patient and the ability of the patient to tolerate a long surgery and a long course of rehabilitation. However, if an amputated specimen is not able to be replanted to its original location entirely, this does not mean that the specimen is unreplantable. In fact, replantation surgeons have learned that only a piece or a portion may be necessary to obtain a functional result, or especially in the case of multiple amputated fingers, a finger or fingers may be transposed to a more useful location to obtain a more functional result. This concept is called \\"spare parts\\" surgery. ==Transplantation== Microsurgical techniques have played a crucial role in the development of transplantation immunological research because it allowed the use of rodents models, which are more appropriate for transplantation research (there are more reagents, monoclonal antibodies, knockout animals, and other immunological tools for mice and rats than other species). Before it was introduced, transplant immunology was studied in rodents using the skin transplantation model, which is limited by the fact that it is not vascularized. Thus, microsurgery represents the link between surgery and transplant immunological research. The first microsurgical experiments (porto- caval anastomosis in the rat) were performed by Dr. Sun Lee (pioneer of microsurgery) at the University of Pittsburgh in 1958. After a short time, many models of organ transplants in rat and mice have been established. Today, virtually every rat or mouse organ can be transplanted with relative high success rate. Microsurgery was also important to develop new techniques of transplantation, that would be later performed in humans. In addition, it allows reconstruction of small arteries in clinical organ transplantation (e.g. accessory arteries in cadaver liver transplantation, polar arteries in renal transplantation and in living liver donor transplantation). ==Treatment of infertility== Microsurgery has been used to treat several pathologic conditions leading to infertility such as tubal obstructions, vas deferens obstructions and varicocele which is one of the most frequent cause of male infertility. Microsurgical drainages by placing micro vascular bypasses between spermatic and inferior epigastric veins as proposed by Flati et al. have been successfully performed in treating male infertility due to varicocele. Microsurgical treatment has been shown to significantly improve fertility rate also in patients with recurrent varicocele who had previously undergone non microsurgical treatments. ==References== ==External links== * E-Medicine Microsurgery Principles * Video recorded through Microscope of Ulnar Artery Repaired using Microsurgical Techniques Category:Surgery Category:Oral and maxillofacial surgery Category:Plastic surgery Category:Otorhinolaryngology ","title":"Microsurgery"},{"id":"1439280","text":"Mikko Henrik Julius Paananen (born 19 December 1974), better known as Mige, is a Finnish musician and songwriter, best known as the bassist and founding member of the gothic rock band HIM. Born to an artistic family, Mige attended the Sibelius Upper Secondary School of music and dance, when he first formed HIM with Ville Valo. The band broke up after Mige began his national military service, but they reformed in 1995. HIM would go on to release eight studio albums and become one of the most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time. The band announced their retirement in March 2017, and played their final show on New Year's Eve 2017. Aside from HIM, Mige has performed several times with Daniel Lioneye, the side-project of HIM guitarist Linde Lindström. In 2010, Mige released a solo album, titled Cimmerica, under the pseudonym MZ. ==Early life== Mikko \\"Mige\\" Paananen was born on 19 December 1974 in Helsinki, Finland.Juho K.

After the additions of keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana \\"Pätkä\\" Rantala, the band, now called HIM, released their debut album Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 in 1997.Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 album sleeve notes. In 2000, now with drummer Gas Lipstick and keyboardist Juska Salminen, HIM released Razorblade Romance, which reached number 1 in Finland, Austria and Germany. Its first single, \\"Join Me in Death\\", also charted at number 1 in Finland and Germany, eventually going platinum in the former. Following the addition of Janne \\"Burton\\" Puurtinen on keyboards, the band released Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights and Love Metal in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Both cracked the top ten in several countries, and became the band's first albums to chart in the United Kingdom and the United States. After relocating to the US, HIM released Dark Light in 2005, which became the group's most successful album to date, going gold in Germany, the UK, the US, and platinum in Finland. In 2007, HIM released Venus Doom, which went gold in Finland and Germany, and gave the band their highest US-chart position at number 12. After 2010's Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice, the band went on hiatus after drummer Gas Lipstick was diagnosed with a repetitive stress injury and nerve damage in his hands.Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine - pg. 10 After eight months of uncertainty, the band regrouped and eventually released the album Tears on Tape in 2013. In 2015, Gas Lipstick announced his departure from HIM after 16 years, to pursue other musical projects. He was subsequently replaced by Jukka \\"Kosmo\\" Kröger. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the end of the band following a farewell tour in 2017. The band played their final show on New Year's Eve 2017 as a part of their annual Helldone Festival. ===Other musical work=== In 2001, Mige played bass on the album The King of Rock 'n Roll by Daniel Lioneye, which also included Linde Lindström on guitar and vocals, and Ville Valo on drums.

She represented the riding of Brampton—Springdale in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2011 as a member of the Liberal Party. Dhalla and British Columbia Conservative MP Nina Grewal were the first Sikh women to serve in the House of Commons of Canada. She was defeated by Conservative Parm Gill in the 2011 federal election. ==Early life== Dhalla was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to an immigrant family from Punjab, India. She first attracted international attention in 1984, when she was ten years old and living in Winnipeg's north end. When Indian soldiers took part in military actions at Punjab's Golden Temple, Dhalla wrote a letter to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, advocating for peace and justice. Gandhi personally replied to Dhalla's letter and referred to it at a press conference held in the months before her assassination, inviting Dhalla to visit India; however, Gandhi was assassinated before Dhalla arrived. She attended McMaster University for her first year of university on a full scholarship. Dhalla then resumed her remaining studies at the University of Winnipeg and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry with a minor in Political Science from the University of Winnipeg in 1995 and was also short listed as a Rhodes Scholarship Nominee from Manitoba. She instead moved to Toronto in the same year, and graduated with a Doctor of Chiropractic from the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in 1999. Upon graduating she started a chain of multidisciplinary health care clinics in the Greater Toronto Area. Dhalla has also pursued a career in acting, working in India for six months and playing a leading role in Kyon? Kis Liye? (translated as Why? and for Whom?), a Bollywood-inspired Hindi-language film shot in Hamilton, Ontario.Randall King, \\"Screen Gem\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 May 2003, D1; \\"Liberal Ruby Dhalla trying to block release of movie in which she co-starred\\", Canadian Press, 12 March 2009, 6:11 am. Dhalla later tried to block the DVD release of Kyon? Kis Liye? in 2009, arguing that publicity photos and posters from the movie had been doctored by putting her face on someone else's body. She also argued that the film was being reissued to exploit her status as an elected official. Producer Charanjit \\"Chico\\" Sihra has said that no images were doctored, also remarking that there is no unsuitable content in the movie. See Mark McNeil, \\"Bollywood poster body not me: MP\\", Hamilton Spectator, 13 March 2009, A5. She finished second in the Miss India Canada pageant in 1993.Rebecca Myers, \\"Unconventional Resumes\\", Time Magazine (Canadian edition), 14 June 2004, p. 17. Dhalla was politically active from a young age and volunteered for Winnipeg Liberal candidate David Walker in the 1988 federal election, and later became a prominent member of the MANITOBA Young Liberals.Canada Votes 2004, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Brampton—Springdale riding profile. Dhalla worked on numerous political campaigns co-chairing different election committees and volunteering in many provincial and federal political campaigns in 1998, she was elected as youth representative the liberal part of Canada's standing committee on multiculturalism at the annual policy convention.\\"Young Liberals elevate Manitoban\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 April 1998, A4. Dhalla was elected as a delegate to the 1992 Liberal Leadership Conventin and was one of the first young liberals in Manitoba to support Paul Martin. Dhalla again supported Paul Martin's bid to become Liberal Party leader in 2003.Jim Brown, \\"BC-Martin-Democracy, Bgt\\", Canadian Press, 9 May 2004, 16:43 report. ==Member of Parliament== ===Government member (2004–2006)=== In May 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin nominated Dhalla as the Liberal candidate for Brampton—Springdale in the 2004 federal election. This decision was opposed by the local Liberal Party riding executive, who had favoured Andrew Kania for the nomination.\\"Would-be Liberal candidates cry foul\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 10 May 2004, A4. The deputy campaign director for the Liberal Party defended Dhalla's selection, describing her as a star candidate who would be beneficial to the party. Even though the Liberal Party was reduced to a minority government Dhalla as elected by a comfortable margin on June 28, 2004 and made history as one of the first women of Indian origin to get elected in Canada as a Member of Parliament. Her victory was also historic as she was the woman of Indian origin to get elected in the world outside of India. Given her health care credentials and business experience Dhalla was appointed to the Standing Committee on Health. In Parliament Dhalla came to be known as an articulate and aggressive speaker on issues affecting her constituents, minorities and women. Dhalla was a prominent organizer of the \\"Canada for Asia\\" benefit concert in January 2005, along with Senator Jerry Grafstein and singer Tom Cochrane. The event raised money for victims of the previous month's tsunami disaster in southeast Asia.Randall King, \\"MP plans relief concert\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 January 2005, D10. She travelled with the Prime Minister to Sri Lanka and India in 2005 on a trade mission visit to promote trade between both nations. In October 2005, Dhalla organized a relief effort for victims of an earthquake in Pakistan.\\"Indo-Canadian MP seeks quake relief\\", Hindustan Times, 21 October 2005, page number not listed. In parliament Dhalla introduced her first private members bill to create a secretariat for foreign credentials recognition. This bill was passed in the House of Commons thus assisting recent Canadian immigrants in gaining professional employment.Ishani Duttagupta, \\"New Canada govt may serve Indian immigrants better\\", Economic Times (English edition), 25 January 2006. Dhalla voted in favour of Canada's same-sex marriage legislation in 2005, on the grounds that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms must confer equality on different groups in society.Heba Aly, \\"Tories say stand on gay marriage tightens race in Brampton\\", The Globe and Mail, 23 December 2005, A15. In late 2005, The Liberal government was defeated by a motion of no confidence, and a new election was called for early 2006. Dhalla officially launched her re- election campaign in early December, with Bollywood actor Arjun Rampal as a star attendee.\\"Arjun Rampal kick-starts Canadian MP's campaign\\", Hindustan Times (English edition), 8 December 2005. Conservative candidate Sam Hundal attempted to use same-sex marriage as a wedge issue among recent immigrant voters, but was unsuccessful. Dhalla was easily re-elected, while the Conservatives won a minority government at the national level. ==Opposition MP (2006–2011)== ===39th Canadian Parliament=== After the election, Dhalla was appointed as the Liberal Health Critic in the Official Opposition. In June 2006, she criticized Health Minister Tony Clement over a possible conflict-of- interest relating to his ownership of shares in Prudential Chem Inc.Bill Curry, \\"Clement resists conflict claims\\", The Globe and Mail, 14 June 2006, A4. The following month, she described Prime Minister Stephen Harper's refusal to attend an international AIDS conference in Toronto as \\"an embarrassment for Canada on the world stage\\".Beth Duff-Brown, \\"Canada's PM will not be among record number of delegates at Toronto AIDS summit\\", Associated Press, 31 July 2006, 16:45 report. In June 2006, It came to light that Conservatives had tried to convince Dhalla to cross the floor and join the party, as part of a campaign to win the support of youth, women and ethnic voters. She turned down the offer, saying that the Conservatives do not represent her values.John Ivison and Peter O'Neil, \\"Indo-Canadian Liberal MP invited to join Tory ranks\\", Vancouver Sun, 16 June 2006, A6. She later criticized Wajid Khan for crossing from the Liberals to the Conservatives.Richard Brennan, \\"Taxpayers have right to see Khan's report, critics argue\\", Toronto Star, 15 January 2007, A10. (Khan was defeated in the 2008 federal election.) Paul Martin resigned as Liberal leader after his party's defeat in the 2006 election. Given her ability to speak, outreach initiatives and her youthfulness, Dhalla was urged by many party members to initially considered enter the contest to succeed him. Dhalla launched a platform to encourage youth and women to participate in the political party and leadership process with voices.ca. Eventually Dhalla gave her support to Michael Ignatieff. And was announced as the Ignatieff Leadership Campaign's national co-chair, alongside Senator David Smith and Member of Parliament Denis Coderre.[21] Ignatieff was defeated by Stéphane Dion on the final ballot of the 2006 Liberal leadership convention. Dion announced his new shadow cabinet in January 2007, and reassigned Dhalla from Health to Social Development.Juliet O'Neill, \\"47 Liberals to shadow 30 Tories\\", National Post, 19 January 2007, A4. She criticized the Conservatives for canceling the Martin government's national day-care plan, and spoke against the prospect of large, for-profit foreign firms taking over the industry.Tonda MacCharles, \\"Opposition parties unite to fight big-box daycare\\", Toronto Star, 1 November 2007, A1; Laurie Monsebraaten, \\"Canada letting kids down, report says\\", Toronto Star, 20 November 2007, A4. She also wrote an opinion piece for the Toronto Star newspaper in early 2008, calling for developed countries to invest the necessary resources to target tuberculosis in the global south.Ruby Dhalla, \\"It's time for action; Tuberculosis is easy to cure but the lack of resources permits epidemic to spread\\", Toronto Star, 26 March 2008, A6. In Parliament Dhalla founded the HAT (HIV, Aids, Tuberculosis) caucus for parliamentarians of all political parties to bring greater awareness on the issues. Dhalla opposed the Conservative government's changes to Canada's immigration laws in early 2008, wherein the government set an annual limit on the number of cases to be heard and gave the Immigration Minister the discretion to fast-track some applicants. Dhalla suggested that the Conservatives would show favouritism to immigrants from certain communities. She was quoted as saying, \\"I think they're really picking and choosing for political purposes which communities they want to work with, and that is why there is a fear among these communities that the immigration laws being proposed right now are going to have an impact on them.\\"Susan Delacourt, \\"Opposition raises discrimination fears; But immigration plan clears one challenge\\", Toronto Star, 10 April 2008, A21; David Akin, \\"Tory budget legislation passes with help from Grits\\", Ottawa Citizen, 10 June 2008, A1. The Liberals as a whole decided not to bring down Harper's minority government on this bill; Dhalla was one of a number of Liberal MPs who voted in opposition. Dhalla also was successful in lobbying the government to allow Sikhs whose last name is Singh or Kaur to not have to attach an additional last name to immigrate to Canada. Dhalla issued a Private Member's Bill in April 2008, calling on the federal government to apologize for the 1914 Komagata Maru incident, in which a ship with 376 mostly Sikh immigrants was denied access to Canada. The bill was unanimously passed the following month.Kim Bolan, \\"Apology on the way for Indo-Canadians\\", Vancouver Sun, 12 May 2008, B1; Joanna Smith, \\"Apologies for past wrongs abound\\", Toronto Star, 20 May 2008, A13. In 2008 Dhalla faced a difficult re-election in 2008, and ultimately defeated Conservative candidate Parm Gill by a small margin amid a provincial swing from the Liberals to Conservatives. This contest was marked with the Opponents (Parm Gills) brother being charged with the slashing of Dhalla's signs.Theresa Boyle, \\"Bitter battle between Dhalla and Gill\\", The Globe and Mail, 15 October 2008, U10. In the 2008 election the Conservatives were re-elected to a second minority government on the national level. Shortly after the election, a Toronto man was charged with making death threats and stalking Dhalla.\\"Toronto man charged with threatening MP\\", The Globe and Mail, 21 October 2008, A10. In Parliament Dhalla continued to raise issues affecting women, minorities and youth and worked to promote trade between Canada and emerging economies. ===January 2008 Indian visit=== Dhalla traveled to the Indian state of Punjab in January 2008. While attending a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) seminar, she called on the state government to introduce more stringent laws to prevent the abuse of married women.\\"Canadian lawmaker calls on Punjab to check domestic violence\\", Asian News International, 7 January 2008. She later visited her parent's village of Mullanpur.\\"NRIs cherish visiting their ancestral villages\\", Asian News International, 21 January 2008. During this trip, a member of Dhalla's staff had a purse stolen by two children. Allegations later surfaced that the children were beaten by the police after being apprehended, and a local television station ran an out-of-context quote from Dhalla that seemed to imply she condoned the violence. The station later issued a full retraction and acknowledged that Dhalla's comments had been presented out of context.Sonya Fateh, \\"Indian police quietly drop case of MP, stolen purse\\", Toronto Star, 10 March 2008, A1. Dhalla clarified that she condemned any type of violence against children and called for an investigation into the incident.CTV.ca News Staff, \\"It MP touring India calls for change after kids beaten \\", CTV.ca, 10 January 2008, , accessed January 2008. ===40th Canadian Parliament=== Stéphane Dion stepped down as Liberal leader after a very poor showing in the 2008 federal election, and Dhalla was mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed him.For instance, see Norma Greenaway, \\"Possible successors a varied lot\\", Montreal Gazette, 21 October 2008, A2; Juliet O'Neill, \\"Dion vows 'respectful' leadership contest\\", Edmonton Journal, 24 October 2008, A6; \\"Two Manitobans among Liberal leadership contenders\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 October 2008, W1; Brian Laghi, Jane Taber, Campbell Clark, \\"The race to renew the Liberal identity\\", The Globe and Mail, 30 October 2008, A17. The Toronto Star listed her as an outside contender, noting that her national profile was not very strong.\\"Taking bets on next Liberal leader\\" [editorial], Toronto Star, 23 October 2008, A6. Before she was able to make her decision, other prominent candidates withdrew from the contest and gave their support to Michael Ignatieff. In December, Dhalla announced she would not be a candidate.Roger Belgrave, \\"Leadership run not in the cards for local MP\\", Brampton Guardian, 18 December 2008. Ignatieff was duly acclaimed as interim leader in January 2009, and was officially confirmed as party leader later in the year. In January 2009, Ignatieff appointed Dhalla as the Liberal critic for Youth and Multiculturalism.\\"No place for Dion on Ignatieff's front bench\\", National Post, 23 January 2009. In a 2008 poll of parliamentary staffers from the Hill Times, Dhalla was voted the second-sexiest female MP, while that year Maxim magazine ranked her third in \\"The World's Hottest Politicians\\". The Globe and Mail columnist Margaret Wente has described Dhalla as unpopular among her colleagues in the Liberal parliamentary caucus, where she is viewed as a \\"high maintenance\\" self-promoter. In a survey of parliamentary staffers from the Hill Times, Dhalla was voted the worst MP to work for, and the pollsters suggested that she had \\"more [staff] turnover than anyone on the hill\\". She was also said to be more interested in the limelight than in doing parliamentary work, with a former caucus colleague saying \\"It's everything starting with making sure she's in every photo-op with the leader. I often hear of events where she calls the organizers and says 'I want to speak,' even though she wasn't invited\\", and she showed up at the 2009 Liberal convention in a white stretch limo. When the caregivers' controversy broke out, one MP was quoted as saying \\"I don't get the sense that too many people are feeling all that sorry for her\\" https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090511.wcowent12/BNStory/specialComment/home Dhalla has tried to block the release of a DVD of a Bollywood movie she starred in before she was elected to Parliament.CTV, \\"Liberal MP Dhalla in 'Bollywood' DVD flap\\", CTV, 11 April 2009. Dhalla has claimed that images of her used for promoting the film were doctored—something the film's producers have denied. Dhalla has also denied producers claims she signed a distribution waiver, was paid $2,000, or gave a supportive TV interview at the premiere in an cinema that screens made-in-India movies. The producers claim to have a witness who saw Dhalla sign the waiver, although purporting that the waiver itself was \\"destroyed in a fire\\". ===Caregivers controversy=== On May 5, 2009, the Toronto Star newspaper ran a front-page story with allegations that two caregivers hired to look after Dhalla's mother had been illegally employed and mistreated. During a public forum with Ontario Liberal cabinet ministers Peter Fonseca and Kathleen Wynne present, the caregivers said that their passports were seized, they worked unpaid overtime, and they were forced to do non- caregiver jobs. Fonseca and Wynne faced accusations in the Ontario legislature that they covered up the incident, with Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath describing it as \\"\\"absolutely shocking\\" that the ministers did nothing to investigate these allegations. Premier Dalton McGuinty defended his ministers, while conceding that both of them \\"exhibited a bit of a tin ear\\". A third caregiver later came forward with similar charges.Dale Brazao, \\"Housekeeper 'paid under table'\\", Toronto Star, 8 May 2009, A1. Dhalla responded that she was \\"shocked and appalled\\" by the allegations and that the caregivers had never been abused. She later released a statement indicating that she had no involvement with the hiring or supervision of the women.Dale Brazao, \\"Ruby's nanny trouble\\", Toronto Star, 5 May 2009, A1. Dhalla stepped down as the Liberal Youth and Multiculturalism Critic on May 6 and called for a federal ethics investigation to clear her name.\\"Dhalla quits critic's role amid family controversy\\", Canadian Press, 6 May 2009, 10:36am; Mike de Souza, \\"Dhalla resigns critic post, vows to clear name\\", National Post, 7 May 2009, A6; Susan Delacourt, \\"Dhalla seeks federal ethics investigation\\", Toronto Star, 7 May 2009, A1. She held a press conference two days later in which she described the allegations against her as a coordinated attack on her reputation. A subsequent The Globe and Mail article suggested that she had few supporters within the federal Liberal caucus, and that other MPs considered her a \\"high maintenance\\" self-promoter, demanding on her staff and unwilling to engage in the mundane details of parliamentary life.CAMPBELL CLARK, GLORIA GALLOWAY AND KAREN HOWLETT, \\"Scandal sidelines ‘high-maintenance' Liberal MP\\", The Globe and Mail, 7 May 2009, A3. Some Liberal MPs have publicly defended her, however, including Judy Sgro.Susan Delacourt, \\"Fellow MP says Dhalla 'devastated'\\", Toronto Star, 8 May 2009, A6. Dhalla's lawyer suggested that the controversy was part of a partisan smear campaign orchestrated by her political opponents.Caroline Alphonso, Kate Hammer and Daniel LeBlanc, \\"Political conspiracy fuelling nanny scandal, Dhalla says; Caregivers' claims ‘complete nonsense'\\", The Globe and Mail, 9 May 2009, A1; David Akin, \\"Dhalla caregivers' allegations a partisan smear, lawyer says\\", Ottawa Citizen, 9 May 2009, A3. Her lawyer later informed the media that one of the caregivers had made unfounded charges against another employer in the past.Emily Senger, \\"Dhalla counsel turns tables on accuser; Man says he was falsely accused of mistreating nanny at centre of issue\\", National Post, 15 May 2009, A2. On the day after Dhalla's appearance, Agathe Mason, the executive director of a Toronto support group for immigrant women called Intercede, testified before the Commons committee that she had called Dhalla (rather than her brother) when one of the caregivers complained about her passport being withheld. Mason said that she informed Dhalla she was breaking the law and had 24 hours to return the passport, and that to her recollection the passport was returned the following day.Gloria Galloway, \\"Foreign-caregiver advocate contradicts Dhalla\\", The Globe and Mail, 14 May 2009; Susan Delacourt and Dale Brazao, \\"Advocate for caregivers says MP's recollections are the opposite of hers\\", Toronto Star, 15 May 2009, A1. Dhalla had previously rejected Mason's accusations, saying that she had never spoken with anyone at Intercede.Susan Delacourt and Dale Brazao, \\"Nanny trouble\\", Toronto Star, 6 May 2009, A1. Immigration Minister Jason Kenney denied the suggestion of political interference, saying he had no personal knowledge of the matter until it was reported by the media.\\"Tory minister Kenney denies conspiring against Ruby Dhalla\\", Canadian Press, 10 May 2009, 2:19pm; Gloria Galloway, \\"Tory minister rejects Dhalla ‘conspiracy'; Kenney says he has never met caregivers\\", The Globe and Mail, 11 May 2009, A3. His ministerial assistant Alykhan Velshi was later seen handing out documents at a meeting of the Immigration Committee in a bid to discredit Dhalla. Some believe Velshi's actions caused a chilling effect among civil servants in Kenney's department, preventing them from reviewing the case in a fair and open manner.Sue Bailey, \\"Kenney's stance on Dhalla could taint probe: critics\\", Canadian Press, 14 May 2009, 5:01pm. Ultimately, no charges were filed. Dhalla asked the public and media to \\"hold judgment and give [her] family privacy\\".\\"Statement from Dr. Ruby Dhalla, Member of Parliament Brampton-Springdale\\", Ruby Dhalla, 8 May 2009. This document is available at Dhalla's website. ==Attempted political comeback== Dhalla was defeated by Conservative Parm Gill in the 2011 federal election. Dhalla organized a press conference on October 5, 2014, with the intention of declaring her candidacy to be the Liberal nominee in Brampton—Springdale for the 2015 federal election but she instead announced that, \\"After much thought and much reflection, I will not be running in the next federal election\\". At her announcement she was surrounded by election signs that had the name of the Liberal Party blacked out. She later told CTV News that after scheduling her press conference she was contacted by Liberal officials who tried to convince her not to run but she subsequently denied this, claiming instead that Liberal Party did want her to run, but that she decided at the last minute that she couldn’t commit to serving as an MP again. ==Electoral record== All electoral information is taken from Elections Canada.

It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen. The breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; approval by Agriculture Canada is pending. Reportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier. Glens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \\"strong dogs\\" rather than \\"sounders\\"—they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers. According to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers. The breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Paddy Brennan Tinahely Co Wicklow, and Willie Kane Tipperary are recognised as two breeders that revived the breed. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year. == Appearance == A \\"big dog on short legs,\\" the Glen of Imaal Terrier is an achondroplastic dwarf breed. It is more substantial than might be expected from photographs; a typical adult Glen weighs about 36 pounds and stands 14\\" tall at the withers. The AKC breed standard specifies a height of 12\\" to 14\\" and a weight of \\"approximately\\" 35 pounds for males and \\"somewhat less\\" for females, with a length-to-height ratio of 5:3. Many champion Glens are larger than breed standard, with some individuals exceeding 40 or even 45 pounds. With three growth stages, a Glen can take up to four years to reach full maturity. Glens have a large head, with rose or half-prick ears; short, bowed legs; and a straight topline that rises slightly toward the tail. The shoulders, chest, and hips are sturdy and muscular (the AKC breed standard specifies an impression of \\"maximum substance for size\\") and the front feet are turned out. The breed is considered unrefined, with antique features that were common in early terriers but which have since fallen out of favor with fanciers and breeders. On their back, Glens have a unique double coat that is wiry with a soft undercoat. The head, sides, and legs have only the softer coat, which typically develops a degree of waviness. The color of the coat may be wheaten or blue (the latter usually with brindling), with both wheaten and blue encompassing a range of shades. Other colorings do occasionally occur in Glens (including a mixture of wheaten and blue referred to as \\"grizzle\\" and a \\"blue and tan\\" that is blue on top with wheaten furnishings) but these rare variations, while not disqualifications, are not favored by fanciers. Wheaten Glen of Imaal Terrier puppy with black highlights in coat Wheaten Glen of Imaal puppies often have black highlights in their fur, and when young may show a \\"dorsal stripe\\" of darker fur down the middle of their backs, but this usually does not appear in their adult coat. The Glen of Imaal terrier does not molt or shed much, and needs to be brushed or combed every week or two to keep the soft coat in good condition and free of matting. It is also typical to strip excess hair from the hard coat two to four times per year; this \\"dead\\" hair pulls out easily and painlessly with the proper tools. Although some extra grooming is needed for showing (for example, the light-colored soft undercoat is often \\"carded\\" from the back to enhance the color of the darker wiry coat), the Glen is intended to have a \\"rough and ready\\" appearance, and show grooming requires less effort than in many other breeds. Glens should look tidy but natural, never manicured or clipped, in the conformation ring. Historically, the breed's tail was typically docked to a length just sufficient to serve as a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Many countries, however, ban docking for showing completely. Ireland has banned showing of dogs whose tails were docked on or after March 6, 2014 (the procedure is also itself illegal with very limited exceptions). In the UK, working terriers can still be shown with docked tails, but dogs kept as pets cannot. == Health == Blue brindle Glen of Imaal Terrier puppy A genetic test is available for progressive retinal atrophy (type crd3), a congenital disorder that gradually results in blindness beginning at about five years of age. As blindness from this cause did not become apparent until well into the breeding years, it was difficult to breed out this trait before the advent of the test. Completely eliminating the defective gene will be tricky even now, as breeding only clear-to-clear would severely restrict choices in an already small gene pool. It is straightforward, however, to produce litters that will never be affected by this type of PRA, even though some individuals in the litter may carry the gene. (Because the trait is recessive, animals with only one copy of the defective gene do not develop PRA, and it is necessary only that one parent be clear to achieve this.) Responsible breeders use the test to plan PRA-free litters and continue to test their animals' eyes annually to validate the test and to monitor for other eye problems. Heart problems are virtually nonexistent in the breed. Some Glen of Imaal Terriers suffer from allergies and skin itching, especially on paws, the typical problem with paws is redness, itching and sores during spells of wet weather. The Glen is not generally affected by the back problems common in certain other long-backed breeds. Hip dysplasia, though occasionally seen, is usually mild, and does not often result in lameness due to the breed's typically muscular build. Responsible breeders use OFA or PennHIP evaluations to ensure that their breeding stock's hips are healthy. Because they are front-heavy and achondroplastic, young Glens are particularly susceptible to growth plate injuries that can significantly affect the development of front leg bones. Owners are advised to discourage their Glens from jumping off sofas, chairs, and beds until at least a year of age and to consult a veterinarian at the first sign of limping. After the age of 12 months, Glens generally do best on a diet lower in protein than other breeds. ==Temperament and behavior== Glen of Imaal terrier demonstrating the \\"Glen sit\\". Glen of Imaal terriers can be energetic and tenacious, but they tend to be more even-tempered, more easygoing, and less vocal than most other terriers. While they love activity, they are not demanding, and are happy to relax by their owner's side. Their bark is deep and authoritative, like that of a much larger dog, and they are said to be good watch dogs. The \\"Glen sit,\\" in which the dog sits on its hind end and holds its entire body vertical, is a posture not commonly seen in other breeds. As terriers, Glens can have a stubborn streak, but they respond well to a firm hand and can withstand correction when necessary. They are intelligent, learn quickly, and socialize easily. They are typically fearless and loyal, and are superb with people, including children. However, some can be dog-aggressive, especially when provoked. By maturity, most Glens develop a robust prey drive and will readily go for vermin such as rats, so they need to be well-socialized with other animals when young—particularly with small household pets that they might mistake for quarry, such as cats and rabbits. Glens often do well at Earthdog trials, Barn Hunt, and in agility. Although not typically strong swimmers due to their short legs and dense body, some Glens can work in water, and others have been trained to herd and drive sheep and cattle. ==Relationship to other breeds== Though the exact origin of the Glen of Imaal Terrier is lost to history, some say that the breed may be related to the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, another Irish terrier breed (in fact, some sources claim all Irish terrier breeds to be derived from the Soft- Coated Wheaten) and/or the Kerry Blue Terrier. The \\"low-slung hounds\\" in the Glen's heritage are sometimes held to be forerunners of the PBGV and the source of the dwarfism. Though the Glen bears a passing resemblance to Scotland's Dandie Dinmont terrier, and even comes in two colors similar to the Dandie's \\"mustard\\" and \\"pepper,\\" it does not seem to be particularly closely related to that breed. DNA analysis indicates that the Glen of Imaal Terrier is more closely related to the mastiff-type dogs than it is to the terriers. The researchers noted that the Glen of Imaal Terrier was one of the breeds where genetic assignments conflict with phenotypic/functional designations. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Dog breeds originating in Ireland Category:FCI breeds Category:Rare dog breeds Category:Terriers Category:Vulnerable Native Breeds ","title":"Glen of Imaal Terrier"},{"id":"1439361","text":"Paul John Mark Szabo (born May 10, 1948) is a Canadian politician. He is a former member of the House of Commons of Canada who represented the riding of Mississauga South for the Liberal Party from 1993 to 2011. ==Early life and education== Szabo was born in Toronto, Ontario. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Western Ontario in 1970. He worked as an accountant for Price Waterhouse in Toronto from 1970 to 1974, and received certification from the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1973. He received an M.B.A. from York University in 1975, was a Corporate Controller for Heede International Ltd. in 1975–76, and served the Director of Finance for TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. from 1977 to 1983. He then worked as a Corporate Treasurer for United Cooperative of Ontario from 1984 to 1990, when he opened a private accounting practice in Mississauga. Szabo has also served as Vice-Chair and Director of the Mississauga Hospital for nine years, Director of Interim Place shelter for abused women for five years, and was a Director of the Peel Regional Housing Authority for five years. ==Politics== Szabo has long been involved with the Liberal Party. He was the party's candidate in Mississauga South for the federal elections of 1980 and 1984, losing to Progressive Conservative Don Blenkarn on both occasions (the first time by 473 votes, the second time by a greater margin). Szabo was first elected in the election of 1993, defeating both Blenkarn and Reformer John Veenstra by a significant margin. He was re-elected in the 1997 election, easily defeating Reformer Joe Peschisolido (who later became a Liberal MP) and PC candidate Dick Barr. He won another comfortable victory in the 2000 election. Szabo is known as one of the more socially conservative members of the Liberal caucus. He is anti-abortion, and has written two works on the perceived breakdown of traditional family values: Divorce - The Bold Facts and Strong Families Make a Strong Country. Szabo also led the opposition within the Liberal caucus with over 50 proposed amendments to a wide-ranging Reproductive Technologies bill cloning, stem cell research, animal-human hybrids etc, and has been credited with modifying the final wording of the bill earning the support of the House for 5 of his key amendments. He was also an opponent of same-sex marriage. In 2004, Szabo was awarded the Joseph P. Borowski Award for his pro-life activities. Szabo has also promoted children's issues, and has brought forward private member's legislation to provide stiffer criminal sentences for abusers of women and children. He has supported greater funding for maternal and parental leave. Here, as well, Szabo's views are strongly influenced by social conservatism. He believes that only a stronger support for the family unit would provide a viable solution to poverty issues. In addition to the two works mentioned above, Szabo has written four other monographs: Tragic Tolerance of Domestic Violence, The Child Poverty Solution, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome - The Real Brain Drain and The Ethics and Science of Stem Cells. All 6 of his books can be viewed on his web site paulszabo.com. Szabo was never appointed to cabinet, but he served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services from 2000 to 2003. He also served as chair of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group for four years. In 2004, Szabo faced a serious challenge from Charles Sousa for the Liberal nomination in Mississauga South. Sousa was supported by many on the left-wing of the Liberal Party, and Szabo was supported by many on its right-wing. Szabo won the challenge, 966 votes to 838. The nomination proved to be Szabo's most difficult challenge in the 2004 campaign. Although the newly founded Conservative Party of Canada targeted his riding, Szabo was able to win re-election with over 50% support. In the 2006 election, Szabo faced a tough effort from Conservative candidate Phil Green (who also ran for the Conservatives in 2004), but still managed to win by just over 2000 votes. However, the Liberals dropped seats to become the Official Opposition while the Conservatives formed a minority government. On October 14, 2008, Szabo won re-election over Hugh Arrison. Szabo was defeated in the May 2, 2011 election when the Conservatives won a majority and the Liberals were reduced to third party status in Parliament. ===Honours=== Notably, Szabo was determined to have spoken the most words in the 38th Parliament—154,683. He also was ranked first in speaking in Parliament in the 39th Parliament and second in the 40th Parliament. During his 17-year career as a Member of Parliament, he spoke in the House on over 2,000 occasions. On November 21, 2006, Szabo was honoured as \\"The Hardest-Working\\" Member of Parliament at the First Annual Parliamentarian of the Year Awards ceremony held at the National Gallery in Ottawa. Sponsored by Macleans, l'Actualite and the Dominion Institute, the selection was based on an Ipsos-Reid survey of all 306 current Members of Parliament. On November 21, 2007, Szabo was honoured with the same award for a second consecutive year at a ceremony held at the Chateau Frontenac Hotel in Ottawa. On May 14, 2009, he was honoured in a ceremony on Parliament Hill with the same award for the third consecutive year. In July 2009, in recognition of his career achievements and leadership contributions to the community, he was also elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. The FCA designation is the highest honour conferred by the Chartered Accounting profession. On December 6, 2011, he was honoured to receive the Rotary International Paul Harris Fellowship for his long career of service to the community and for his longstanding support for the work of Rotary. Among his many chairmanship appointments, his position as Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, commonly known as the \\"Ethics Committee\\", reached high- profile public recognition in late 2007 and early 2008 as the committee was convened to review the monetary and business dealings between former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and German-Canadian Karlheinz Schreiber.PARLINFO - Parliamentarian File - Federal Experience - SZABO, Paul John Mark, B.Sc., M.B.A., F.C.A., F.C.P.A. == References == ==External links== *Official website * Category:1948 births Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Politicians from Toronto Category:University of Western Ontario alumni Category:York University alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Paul Szabo"},{"id":"1439369","text":"The Honda A series inline-four-four-cylinder engine is used in 1980s Honda Accord and Prelude models.

Most upgrades and modifications to the A-series engines are of the do-it-yourself variety, with one of the more popular being a turbo setup and OBD-1 conversion for more tuneability options. ==A-Series engines== The engine of the A-series is based on the cylinder block of the 1.8-liter engine: the 1.6-liter engine has a reduced piston stroke, and the 2.0-liter engine is obtained by increasing the cylinder bore. ===A16A1=== The A16A1 was a carbureted 1.6-liter engine used in 1986–1989 Accords and Vigors outside the North American market. This engine was known as the EZ in 1984 and 1985, non-US Accords.

It has a SOHC 12-valve NON-CVCC cylinder head, with two intake valves and one exhaust valve per cylinder. They were found in both Accords and Preludes during the 1980s. A20A1 & A20A2 The A20A1 and A20A2 were the carbureted versions of the A20A engines. It was available in the 1986–1989 Accord DX and LX. They are the same engine, the only difference between them being that the A20A2 has no emissions components, so it has a slightly higher power output. Specifications * Induction: Single 2bbl Keihin Feedback Carburetor * Exhaust: 4-1 Cast Manifold * Displacement: * Bore x Stroke: * Compression Ratio : 9.2:1; 9.1:1 (Accord KX model) * Power (A20A1): ** ** at 3500 rpm * Power (A20A2, Indonesia): ** at 5500 rpm ** at 3500 rpm A20A3 and A20A4 The A20A3 and A20A4 were the fuel injected versions of the A20A engines. They were run by Honda's PGM-FI system on a partial OBD-0 computer. The A20A4 gives a slightly higher power output because of not having emissions components. The A20A3 was offered in the 1984–1987 Honda Prelude 2.0Si, the 1986-1989 Honda Accord LX-i as well as the 1989 Honda Accord SE-i. In 1988, the A20A3 injection system in the US and Canada has been upgraded with a new two-stage intake manifold (Dual-Stage Intake Manifold) and 4-2-1 exhaust manifold and the compression ratio has been increased from 8.8 to 9.3 netting extra 10hp and 8lb-ft of torque.

Soon after graduation, she obtained her first television role in Lexx. She also moderated the children Pumuckl TV broadcast on German TV (1995/1996). Lexx was on a two year hiatus between seasons 1 and 2. During this time Habermann appeared in the ZDF series Rosa Roth and the ARD series Gegen den Wind as well as appearing in the Rosamunde Pilcher film Two Sisters. Due to scheduling conflicts, she was ultimately unable to commit to the second season of the show, although she was able to free up enough time in her schedule to appear in the first two episodes, allowing the writers to deal with her character properly. In 1999, she took drama lessons and played in such German TV series as Tatort, Der Ermittler, Die Kommissarin and '. In 2005, she was in the new episodes of the twenty-year-old series The Black Forest Clinic and in 2006 she was seen in the TV movie In Heaven You Write Love Differently alongside Erol Sander.

Founded in 1925 in St. Louis, they have performed at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, since 1932. Until 2015, they also had a touring company. They are best known for starring in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual Christmas show, and for performing annually at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. The Rockettes also conduct the Rockette Summer Intensive for dancers aspiring to be Rockettes. ==History== ===Early years=== Parade of the Wooden Soldiers\\" at the Christmas Spectacular The Rockettes were originally inspired by the Tiller Girls, a precision dance company of the United Kingdom established by John Tiller in the 1890s. Tiller sent the first troupe of Tiller Girls to perform in the United States in 1900, and eventually there were three lines of them working on Broadway. In 1922, choreographer Russell Markert saw one of these troupes, known as the Tiller Rockets, perform in the Ziegfeld Follies and was inspired to create his own version with American dancers. As Markert would later recall, \\"If I ever got a chance to get a group of American girls who would be taller and have longer legs and could do really complicated tap routines and eye-high kicks, they'd really knock your socks off.\\" The Rockettes have long been represented by the American Guild of Variety Artists. In 1967, they won a month-long strike for better working conditions, which was led by American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA) salaried officer Penny Singleton. In August 2002, contract negotiations for the troupe's veteran members resulted in a buyout by the owners of The Radio City Music Hall. Roughly a fourth of the veteran Rockettes were offered retirement options, while the remaining dancers were offered the opportunity to re-audition. ===Radio City Rockettes=== A Rockette in Radio City Music Hall On August 1, 2007, the Rockettes were inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. ==Controversies== ===Discrimination and lack of diversity=== The Rockettes were created in 1925, but the first non-white Rockette, a Japanese-born woman named Setsuko Maruhashi, was not hired until 1985. The Rockettes did not allow dark-skinned dancers into the dance line until 1987. The justification for this policy was that such women would supposedly distract from the consistent look of the dance group. The first African American Rockette was Jennifer Jones; selected in 1987, she made her debut in 1988 at the Super Bowl halftime show. The first person with a visible disability hired by the Rockettes (Sydney Mesher, missing a left hand due to symbrachydactyly), was hired in 2019. ===Trump inauguration controversy=== In late 2016, the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the troupe, agreed to have the Rockettes perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump. According to a report in the New York Daily News, there was an initial \\"edict\\" to perform at the inaugural. Immediately several Rockettes dissented, including Rockette Phoebe Pearl who complained that she was being forced to perform at the inaugural against her wishes. One Rockette felt reluctant to \\"perform for this monster\\", referring to president-elect Donald Trump, and another said she \\"wouldn't feel comfortable standing near a man like that in our costumes.\\" Madison Square Garden issued a statement saying that \\"For a Rockette to be considered for an event, they must voluntarily sign up and are never told they have to perform at a particular event, including the inaugural. It is always their choice. In fact, for the coming inauguration, we had more Rockettes request to participate than we have slots available.\\" Another report suggested that dancers were allowed to \\"opt-out\\" if they thought that they would feel uncomfortable performing. Many on social media believed attendance was mandatory, including Julissa Sabino, a performer who is part of the union, who tweeted that the issue \\"breaks my heart\\" and urged supporters to \\"help these ladies.\\" Autumn Withers, a former Rockette, supported a boycott, saying \\"take a knee, ladies!\\" In December 2016, according to The Atlantic, three of the thirteen full-time dancers had chosen to sit out the event. The company danced to a medley of Irving Berlin songs at the Inaugural Ball on the evening of January 20. ==Notable former Rockettes== * Lucille Bremer * Pat Colgate * Maria Fletcher * Jennifer Jones * Suzanne Kaaren * Alicia Luciano * Margaret E.

He played college football for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the 12th round of the 1991 NFL Draft, and he was also a member of the Cleveland Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Diego Chargers and Houston Texans. A two-time Pro Bowl selection, McCardell won two Super Bowl rings, with the Redskins in 1991 and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002. He is currently the wide receivers coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars. ==Early years== McCardell is the son of Arthur and Mattie McCardell. He attended Waltrip High School in Houston, Texas.\\"Distinguished HISD Alumni .\\" Houston Independent School District. He was a three-sport athlete, playing quarterback in football as well as participating in basketball and track. ==College career== McCardell starred at UNLV, where his speed and athleticism enabled him to become one of the premier wide receivers in college football. He left as the school’s leading all-time receiver with 141 catches for 2,189 yards (15.5 yards per catch) and 15 touchdowns. He emerged as UNLV’s big-play receiver during his junior year, catching 54 passes for 883 yards (16.4 avg.) and five touchdowns, while being named team MVP and becoming the first UNLV receiver to post four consecutive 100-yard games. ==Professional playing career== ===Washington Redskins=== McCardell was selected in the 12th round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, but he never took the field in a Redskins’ uniform. He, however, got a Super Bowl ring with the Redskins while being on injured reserve. He was cut after the 1991 season. ===Cleveland Browns=== McCardell signed with the Cleveland Browns in 1992. He saw his first regular season action, but only recorded one reception for eight yards. His 1993 season wasn't much better in terms of catches, but he did score his first professional touchdown. He would record three more before the 1993 season was over. His production steadily increased during his time in Cleveland. Although he only started five games in 1995, he racked up 56 catches, 709 yards, and four touchdowns. Following the season, he became a free agent.

During his first season with the team he made 85 catches for 1,129 yards and three touchdowns, and earned himself a trip to his first ever Pro Bowl. With the emergence of teammate Jimmy Smith, the Jaguars had one of the best duos at wide receiver in the NFL. They earned the nickname \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" with McCardell as \\"Thunder\\" because of his ability to run routes in the middle of the field. After the 2001 season, McCardell, along with many other Jaguar starters, were waived due to salary cap reasons. He finished his six-year career with the Jaguars recording 499 receptions for 6,393 yards and 30 touchdowns. ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== McCardell signed with the Tampa Buccaneers before the 2002 season. The Buccaneers would go on to win Super Bowl XXXVII, beating the AFC champion Oakland Raiders 48-21 with McCardell scoring two touchdowns in that game. He became the team’s primary receiver late in the 2003 season, making his second Pro Bowl, mainly due to a dispute between receiver Keyshawn Johnson and the Buccaneers organization, which ultimately ended in Johnson being traded to the Dallas Cowboys for Joey Galloway. McCardell started the 2004 season as a holdout with the Buccaneers after wanting a new contract. ===San Diego Chargers=== After the dispute with the Buccaneers, McCardell was traded to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for a third- and fifth-round draft pick in the 2005 NFL Draft. In 2005, he was the team’s second-leading receiver behind tight end Antonio Gates, totaling 70 catches for 917 yards, and a career-high nine touchdown receptions.

They released a minority report recommending that current anti-discrimination policies remain in place. Paige ultimately decided to only pursue the recommendations that earned unanimous support from the commission. Julie Foudy and Ian Sawyers have been married since 1995. Foudy gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Isabel Ann, on January 1, 2007. Their second child, a son named Declan, was born in December 2008. She appeared in the HBO documentary Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team. Brandi Chastain and Julie Foudy in Brazil in 2014. In 2014, Brandi Chastain and Julie Foudy worked together to host clinics for young women in Brazil to encourage young women to play soccer. ==See also== * List of FIFA Women's World Cup goalscorers * List of Olympic medalists in football * List of 1996 Summer Olympics medal winners * List of 2000 Summer Olympics medal winners * List of 2004 Summer Olympics medal winners * List of footballers with 100 or more caps * List of MLS Cup broadcasters * List of FIFA World Cup broadcasters * List of ESPN Major League Soccer personalities * List of people from San Diego * List of Stanford University people ==References== ==Further reading== * Grainey, Timothy (2012), Beyond Bend It Like Beckham: The Global Phenomenon of Women's Soccer, University of Nebraska Press, * Kassouf, Jeff (2011), Girls Play to Win Soccer, Norwood House Press, * Lisi, Clemente A.

Poe and Kelly were married in 1940 after their first two children were born. Actor Conrad Poe, meanwhile, was his illegitimate son by actress Patricia Mijares. The original spelling of his surname was Pou () via his father, playwright Lorenzo Pou, a Catalan immigrant from Majorca in the Balearic Islands. Pou established a mining business in the Philippines and married a Pangasinense woman named Marta Reyes. Poe graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from the University of the Philippines in 1935 and the degree of Doctor of Dental Medicine from the Philippine Dental College in 1942. Poe died in 1951 while working on a film, after he had permitted a rabid puppy to lick his wound. == Selected filmography == * Darna (1951) * Forbidden Women (1948) * Giliw ko (1939) * Zamboanga (1938) also known as Fury in Paradise (UK) * Eseng ng Tondo (1937) == References == == External links == * Category:1916 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Deaths in Metro Manila Category:People from San Carlos, Pangasinan Category:Male actors from Pangasinan Category:Accidental deaths in the Philippines Category:Deaths due to dog attacks Category:Deaths from rabies Category:Filipino Roman Catholics Category:Filipino people of Catalan descent Category:Infectious disease deaths in the Philippines Fernando Category:20th- century Filipino male actors Category:Burials at the Manila North Cemetery ","title":"Fernando Poe Sr."},{"id":"1439408","text":"Westminster Catechism may refer to: *Westminster Shorter Catechism *Westminster Larger Catechism ","title":"Westminster Catechism"},{"id":"1439425","text":"Michael Ruse (born 21 June 1940) is a British-born Canadian philosopher of science who specializes in the philosophy of biology and works on the relationship between science and religion, the creation–evolution controversy, and the demarcation problem within science. Ruse currently teaches at Florida State University. ==Career== Ruse was born in Birmingham, England, attending Bootham School, York. He took his undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol (1962), his master's degree at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario (1964), and Ph.D. at the University of Bristol (1970). Ruse taught at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada for 35 years. Since his retirement from Guelph, he has taught at Florida State University and is the Lucyle T. Werkmeister Professor of Philosophy (2000–present). In 1986, he was elected as a Fellow of both the Royal Society of Canada and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has received honorary doctorates from the University of Bergen, Norway (1990), McMaster University, Ontario, Canada (2003) and the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada (2007). In September 2014 he was made an Honorary Doctor of Science by University College London. Ruse was a key witness for the plaintiff in the 1981 test case (McLean v. Arkansas) of the state law permitting the teaching of \\"creation science\\" in the Arkansas school system. The federal judge ruled that the state law was unconstitutional. His 1996 book on the idea of progress in biology (orthogenesis), Monad to Man, had a mixed reception from other philosophers of biology. Peter J. Bowler described it as an important and controversial book on the status of evolutionism. Ron Amundson called Ruse an analytic and empiricist philosopher, but found Ruse's handling of structuralism \\"less satisfactory\\" than of the adaptationist, Darwinian traditions. He called Ruse's writing style \\"bluff, unselfconscious, and opinionated\\" and finds Ruse sarcastic, \\"scarcely a neutral observer\\". Michael Ghiselin criticised Ruse as a \\"politically correct\\" \\"academic bigot\\", disagreed with Ruse's narrative about phylogenetics, and accused him of \\"completely ignor[ing] recent work such as by Carl Woese, \\"neglect[ing] data\\" that contradict his thesis. Ironically, in Ghiselin's view, Ruse's own epistemological ideal for science relied on the idea of Progress. Ruse delivered some of the 2001 Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology at the University of Glasgow. His lectures on Evolutionary Naturalism, \\"A Darwinian Understanding of Epistemology\\" and \\"A Darwinian Understanding of Ethics,\\" are collected in The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding (ed. Anthony Sanford, T & T Clark, 2003). Ruse debates regularly with William A. Dembski, a proponent of intelligent design. Ruse takes the position that it is possible to reconcile the Christian faith with evolutionary theory. Ruse founded the journal Biology and Philosophy, of which he is now Emeritus Editor, and has published numerous books and articles. He cites the influence of his late colleague Ernan McMullin. Since 2013, Ruse has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. In 2014, Ruse was named the Bertrand Russell Society's award winner for his dedication to science and reason.Philosophy professor honored by Bertrand Russell Society for dedication to science and reason; Florida State University Arts and Sciences; May 20, 2014 Ruse has sought to reconcile science and religion, a position which has brought him into conflict with Richard Dawkins and Pharyngula science blogger PZ Myers. Ruse has engaged in heated exchanges with new atheists. According to Ruse in 2009, \\"Richard Dawkins, in his best selling The God Delusion, likens me to Neville Chamberlain, the pusillanimous appeaser of Hitler at Munich. Jerry Coyne reviewed one of my books (Can a Darwinian be a Christian?) using the Orwellian quote that only an intellectual could believe the nonsense I believe in. And non-stop blogger P. Z. Myers has referred to me as a 'clueless gobshite.'\\" Ruse said new atheists do the side of science a \\"grave disservice\\", a \\"disservice to scholarship\\", and that \\"Dawkins in The God Delusion would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course\\", and that The God Delusion makes him \\"ashamed to be an atheist\\". Ruse concluded, saying \\"I am proud to be the focus of the invective of the new atheists. They are a bloody disaster\\". ==Personal life== Ruse has two children from his first marriage, and has been married to his second wife since 1985, with whom he has three children. Ruse is an atheist. ==Selected works== *The Darwinian revolution (1979) *Is science sexist? and other problems in the biomedical sciences (1981) *Darwinism defended, a guide to the evolution controversies (1982) *Sociobiology, sense or nonsense?

Other features included in the product are a personal firewall, email spam filtering, and phishing protection. With the release of the 2015 line in summer 2014, Symantec officially retired Norton Internet Security after 14 years as the chief Norton product. It is superseded by Norton Security, a rechristened adaptation of the Norton 360 security suite. Symantec distributed the product as a download, a boxed Compact Disc (CD) copy, and as OEM software. Some retailers also distributed it on a USB flash drive. Norton Internet Security held a 61% market share in the United States retail security suite category in the first half of 2007. In this study, competitors, in terms of market share, included security suites from CA, Inc., Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab. ==Windows edition== In August 1990, Symantec acquired Peter Norton Computing from Peter Norton Norton and his company developed various applications for DOS, including an antivirus. Symantec continued the development of the acquired technologies, now marketed under the name of \\"Norton\\", with the tagline \\"from Symantec\\". Norton's crossed-arm pose, a registered U.S. trademark, was featured on Norton product packaging. However, his pose was later moved to the spine of the packaging, and later dropped altogether. Users of the 2006, and later versions, can upgrade to the latest version of the Norton software without buying a new subscription. The upgraded product retains the same number of days left on a user's subscription. Releases are named by year but have internal version numbers as well. The internal version number was advanced to 15.x in the 2008 edition to match the Norton AntiVirus release of the same year. As of the 2013 (20.x) release the product has dropped the year from its name, although it still is referenced in some places. ===Version 2000 (1.0, 2.0)=== Norton Internet Security 2000, released January 10, 2000, was Symantec's first foray beyond virus protection and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics that were not ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted the lack of information presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked. Norton LiveUpdate downloads and installs program updates. The Family Edition adds parental controls. Parental controls are backed by a quality control team of 10 searching the web for inappropriate content. Found content is categorized in subject matter and placed on a blacklist of about 36,000 sites. A designed administrator can add blocked sites, however the pre- supplied blacklist cannot be viewed or edited since it is hard coded. Administrators can block certain subject matters. Another option is to block all sites, then create a whitelist of allowed sites. Family Edition can also block transmission of specified personal information. Such information is replaced with the letter \\"X\\". However, CNN noted X-rated sites are retrieved when personal information is queried by a search engine. Version 2.0 was released June 12, 2000 ===Version 2001 (2.5, 3.0)=== Version 2001 (2.5) was released September 18, 2000, adding support for Windows ME in addition to the Windows 9x series, Windows NT, and Windows 2000. Following attacks by the ILOVEYOU and Anna Kournikova script viruses, this version can block malicious scripts without virus signatures, but by analyzing behavior. The firewall scans for Internet-enabled applications and creates access rules based on a knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750 MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts. The Family Edition, like the prior version, includes parental controls and the information filtering feature. Parental controls come with a list of objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time. Version 3.0 was released March 19, 2001 ===Version 2002 (4.0, 5.0)=== Version 2002 was announced August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release. The installation was noted as quick and simple by both PC Magazine and CNET. An installation requires a reboot, and afterwards the Security Assistant guides users through a questionnaire to best configure the settings. A problem CNET encountered when upgrading from the prior release was the loss of customized settings. PC Magazine found the default settings, aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat permissive. Windows 95 support was also dropped. Running a full scan complies a list of Internet-enabled applications. Users set permissions or accept Norton's default settings. The firewall detects and blocks port scans and logs intrusion attempts. This version does not run a trace on attackers, however Symantec is planning an online tool to do so. To ensure rogue programs can not masquerade as trustworthy applications, Norton verifies programs against a list of digital signatures for known programs, update Tracker warns users if hackers attempt to gain access to users' computers. The firewall blocked all access attempts from Shields Up and Port Checker. This version includes a wizard to simplify firewall setup to accommodate for multiple computers sharing an Internet connection. With this release, Norton can prevent specified personal information from being transmitted via a compatible instant messenger client, e-mail, and websites. Ad-blocking includes the Ad Trashcan, where users can place ads that slipped past ad-filtering. A Professional Edition was announced December 11, 2001, with marketing aimed towards business owners. This version features Norton Intrusion Detection, which intercepts suspicious connections and attacks, such as the Code Red worm. Intrusion Detection focuses on Windows-based attacks only. Central management is also present in this version. Administrators configure firewall and productivity settings for client computers. Productivity settings allow administrators to block newsgroups, websites, and advertisements. The suite integrates with XP user accounts; settings can be personalized for each user. ===Version 2003 (6.x)=== Version 2003 was announced September 16, 2002, scheduled to be available for purchase later that month. This version adds Norton Spam Alert to reduce. Spam filtering scans the whole message and its context, rather than looking for keywords to ensure accuracy. A POP3 client must be used. When a message is identified as spam, Norton inserts an identifier, by default it is \\"Spam Alert:\\", in the subject line. Using the mail client, users can create a rule to delete or move flagged messages. Users can also create strings of text for Spam Alert to look for when classifying e-mail. In PC Magazine testing, Spam Alert mistakenly classified 2.8 percent of legitimate e-mail as spam. 47 percent of spam slipped past the filter. Although false positive rate was low, the feature did not fare well at finding actual spam. The updated main interface has green and red indicators to show which features are active and which need attention. The firewall has several updated features in this version. A Block Traffic button present in the main interface blocks all incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. Another new feature, the Visual Tracker, graphically maps attacks back to their origin. The firewall blocked all port scans conducted by CNET, stealthing each port. Following the Nimda and Code Red worms, this version scans all incoming and outgoing traffic for suspicious data exchanges against a routinely updated database, a feature ported from Norton Internet Security 2002 Professional Edition. Connection to the offending computer is automatically severed if the traffic matches a database item. Symantec announced a Professional Edition on November 19, 2002. Data recovery tools in this version allow users to recover deleted or malware- damaged files. The inclusion of a data erasure tool allows users to delete files while minimizing the chance of recovery. Web Cleanup removes browser cache files, history, and cookies. To maintain dial-up connections, Connection Keep Alive simulates online activity during periods of user inactivity. Norton Productivity Control enables users to filter Internet content and block newsgroups. When used with the User Access Manager, multiple filtering profiles can be created, assigned to different users. ===Version 2004 (7.x)=== Announced September 8, 2003, version 2004 adds adware, spyware, and keylogger protection. PC Magazine found the added protection to be weak. Out of the spyware samples Norton detected, a significant number were not removed completely, requiring manual removal. Norton also did little to prevent spyware infections. Norton AntiSpam, the renamed spam filtering feature, has a set of spam rules, which cannot be viewed or edited. Whitelists and blacklists of senders can be created. Users may also create their own spam definitions. AntiSpam integrates with Outlook, Outlook Express, and Eudora, allowing users to tag e-mail as spam on-the-fly. E-mail identified as spam are either quarantined by default, however the feature can be configured to delete such messages automatically. In CNET testing, AntiSpam correctly identified 94 percent of spam messages. Product activation was introduced in this release. After installation, users are allowed a 15-day grace period to activate their copy of Norton Internet Security 2004. The program will not work after the deadline without the 24-character product key. The product key used to activate a copy of Norton Internet Security ties in with an alphanumeric code based on a computer's hardware configuration. Users may activate their product five times with the same product key, however licensing terms dictate users are allowed only to install Norton Internet Security 2004 on one computer. ===Version 2005 (8.x)=== Symantec introduced Version 2005 on August 17, 2004. This version is sometimes referred to with the tagline of \\"AntiSpyware Edition\\", since spyware detection is integrated with Norton and is by default enabled. Found threats are listed, separating the ones already dealt with and the ones requiring user interaction. More detailed information is provided through a link to Symantec's website. However, PC Pro and PC Magazine noted lengthy scan times. A full scan took 24 minutes to over half an hour, respectively. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 61 percent of the spyware samples, compared to an average of 68 percent for all the tested products. Removal rates were above average, 72 percent versus the average of 68 percent. Norton blocked reinstallation with a score of 48 percent, compared to the group average of 43 percent. Overall, Norton ranked fifth among the tested products. In PC Magazine testing, Norton installed slowly on infected systems and failed to install on one altogether. Contacting Symantec did not resolve the issue. Other new features include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The addition of the feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements. Privacy Control can warn users when sending confidential information. It can also be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item- specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted on the list of confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information. Norton AntiSpam now scans e-mails for spoofed URLs and deals with any offending e-mail as spam. E-mails can also be blocked based on language, however by default the filter allows all languages. AntiSpam can sync its own list of allowed senders with POP3 address books. Users can train the spam filter by pointing out valid e-mail marked as spam and vice versa. Support for Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail was added in this release. ===Version 2006 (9.x)=== Norton Internet Security 2006's main interface. Norton Internet Security 2006 debuted on September 26, 2005. The new main interface, the Norton Protection Center, aggregates all information in a central location. Security status is shown by how secure the computer is for tasks such as e-mail and Internet browsing, not in the context of which features are enabled. The Protection Center can also recognize third-party software protecting the computer. The new interface advertises additional products from Symantec; some categories of protection, such as \\"Data Protection\\", will read \\"No Coverage\\" until the user purchases and installs Norton SystemWorks. An additional system tray icon is created by the Protection Center. The installation was noted as lengthy by PC Magazine, especially on malware-infected systems. Spyware detection has been tweaked since the last release. It has been updated to better identify keyloggers. In PC Magazine testing, Norton successfully detected all 11 spyware threats and removed all but two. PC Magazine did give Norton credit even when manual removal was required. The suite also removed three of four commercial keyloggers. When attempting to install the spyware on a clean system, Norton blocked all 11 and two of the four commercial keyloggers. In most cases, it did not block the installation, however Norton did call for a scan after the spyware was installed. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 78 percent of spyware, removed 82 percent, and blocked 65 percent from installing. Norton AntiSpam was discontinued as a separate product from Symantec, now only available in Norton Internet Security. The feature can block all e-mail from unknown senders, and automatically blocks messages with suspicious elements such as invisible text, HTML forms, and phishing URLs. To improve accuracy, Norton analyzes outgoing e-mails and messages whose categorization is corrected by users by hitting the \\"This is spam\\" and \\"This is not spam\\" buttons. In PC Magazine testing, the feature marked one in ten valid e-mail as spam and let one in every six spam messages in the inbox. 400 messages were used, and the program was allowed to process the messages for over a week. In PC Pro testing, the feature performed better, blocking 96 percent of spam, with a false positive rate of 0.2 percent. Norton recommends disabling the Windows Firewall to avoid redundant alerts. The firewall stealthed all significant ports in PC Magazine testing. Attacking the firewall itself was unsuccessful, and PC Magazine was unable to stop its service, terminate its process, or disable the firewall using simulated mouse clicks. The firewall also passed PC Pros tests, successfully stealthing all ports. Other features include Bloodhound technology, which looks for virus-like behavior to better find zero day viruses. The Security Inspector looks for common vulnerabilities, including insecure user account passwords and browser insecurities. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. Parental controls, an optional component, can block certain programs from accessing the Internet, such as IM clients, and restrict newsgroup access. Restrictions can be assigned to different Windows users accounts. Sites are classified in 31 categories, and the four profiles which can be assigned each block different categories of sites. Supervisors define exceptions, add global blocked sites, or block all access to sites not on a user-created whitelist. Both PC Magazine and PC Pro noted the exclusion of time-based restrictions. Information filtering can be controlled on a per-user basis. Windows 98 compatibility was dropped from this release. ===Version 2007 (10.x)=== The 2007 version was announced September 12, 2006. A tabbed interface allows users to access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate tray icons and windows open. Symantec revised Norton Internet Security and made this version more modularized, which has reduced the suite's memory usage to 10–15 megabytes and scan times by 30–35 percent. Another result is that spam filtering and parental controls are separate components to install. When installed, the features consume 100 MB of disk space. Anti-phishing integrates with Internet Explorer. It analyzes sites, examining the website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, and uses a blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let over half of the spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update. The firewall makes all decisions by itself to lessen the chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was blocked by the firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were blocked by the intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services had no effect on the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses. In PC Magazine testing, Norton detected 15 of 16 spyware samples. 13 of the 16 were removed. Against eight commercial keyloggers, the suite removed all the samples. On a clean system, Norton blocked 14 of the 16 spyware samples from installing, and stopped seven of the eight keyloggers from installing. ===Version 2008 (15.x)=== The 2008 version was announced on August 28, 2007, adding support for Windows Vista 64-bit. New features include SONAR, the Norton Identity Safe, and Browser Defender. SONAR monitors applications for malicious behavior. The Identity Safe supersedes the information filtering function; instead of blocking personal information from leaving the computer, it stores personal information to fill webforms. It is password protected and checks a website's authenticity before filling any forms. Browser Defender inspects and blocks suspicious API calls, intended to stop drive-by downloads. The Network Map identifies networked computers with Norton Internet Security 2008 installed. Remote monitoring allows checking the status of other installations on different computers; problems are identified with a red \\"X\\" icon. Using the feature, users also can control network traffic between computers. It also warns users if they are using an unencrypted wireless network. The startup application manager and advertisement blocking features were dropped from this release. Information filtering, although superseded by the Identity Safe in the suite, is available separately. It can be used in conjunction with the Identity Safe. Phishing protection now integrates with Mozilla Firefox. Testing by PC Magazine found that Norton blocked 94 percent of phishing sites, compared to 83 percent for Internet Explorer 7 and 77 percent for Firefox 2. CNET identified an issue with the feature; when anti-phishing is disabled, the Identity Safe still offers users to automatically submit personal information to websites, including phishing sites. Symantec declined to call it a \\"flaw\\", stating it is recommended to use the Identity Safe with anti-phishing enabled. Alternatively, the Identity Safe could be used with Firefox and Internet Explorer's built-in anti-phishing capability. PC Magazine found that the firewall put all ports in stealth mode. The firewall blocked ten of 12 leak tests, used to see if malware can evade the firewall's control of network traffic. Previous versions did not identify the tests because none carried a malicious payload. Another test was conducted using Core Impact, which successfully exploited one vulnerability on the test computer. However, other components of Norton stopped the exploit from causing harm. The other attempts were unsuccessful either because the system was invulnerable or Norton's Intrusion Prevention System stopped it. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful by PC Magazine. On the contrary, PC Pro identified 15 open ports on a computer with Norton installed. In PC Magazine testing, Norton completely detected most of the malware samples. For two- thirds of the samples, all traces were removed. Norton found and removed all the commercial keyloggers. A full scan took nearly an hour to complete though, twice as long as the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the malware from installing and all the commercial keyloggers, regardless of any modifications made to the samples. PC World noted that Norton removed 80 percent of malware- associated files and Registry entries. Spam filtering imports users' address books to compile a whitelist of allowed senders. Addresses to which users send mail and e-mail tagged as valid mail can be automatically added to the whitelist. Using several thousand messages, PC Magazine found that Norton marked over 40 percent of valid e-mail as spam. Over 80 percent of valid newsletters were marked as spam. Norton did correctly identify 90 percent of spam e-mail. ===Version 2009 (16.x)=== The main user interface of Norton Internet Security 2009 The 2009 version was released for sale September 9, 2008. Symantec set several goals for version 2009 while in development: complete installations under minute and a footprint of 100 MB. Average installation times range from eight to ten minutes, and the previous 2008 version had a 400 MB footprint. Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20–30 seconds to 10 seconds, and file scanning times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files. The technology works on the basis that if a piece of software runs on a significant proportion of computers, then it is safe. A public beta was released July 14. A reduction in memory consumption was made, prompted by the fact 40 percent of people contacting Symantec support had 512 MB of RAM. The beta uses about 6 MB of memory, compared to 11 MB by the prior version. To reduce scan times, Norton Insight uses data from Norton Community participants to avoid scanning files that are found on a statistically significant number of computers. Citing a NPD Group study finding that 39 percent of consumers switching antiviruses blamed performance, a CPU usage meter will be available within the final product to allow users to find the cause of high CPU usage, whether it be Norton or another program. This version features more frequent updates, a change called Norton Pulse Updates. Rather than deliver an update every eight hours, as the 2008 version does, Pulse Updates are delivered five to fifteen minutes. The Silent Mode automatically suspends alerts and updates when a program enters fullscreen mode and can be manually enabled. The suite's activities take place while the computer is idle, and terminate once user activity is registered. The final release (16.5) bundles spam filtering, which used to be a free download from Symantec. This release also bundles Norton Safe Web, which identifies malicious websites, compatible with Internet Explorer and Firefox. Norton Safe Web color codes search results from famous search engine such from Google and Yahoo for safety. The Norton Safe Web toolbar also includes an Ask.com search box. The search box does not share code with the Ask toolbar; instead the box redirects queries to the Ask search engine. Norton Safe Web is compatible with Internet Explorer and Firefox. Norton Safe Web. Benchmarking conducted by PassMark Software highlights the 2009 version's 52 second install time, 32 second scan time, and 7 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software. Tests were conducted in Windows Vista running on a dual core processor. PC Magazine found the suite added 15 seconds to the boot time, with a baseline of 60 seconds. Norton added less than 5 percent to the time it takes to complete file operations. 25 percent more time was taken to unzip and zip a set of files. In PC Magazine testing, Norton removed most traces of 40 percent of the malware. On a similar test, specifically using commercial keyloggers, Norton was able to remove most of the keyloggers, beating other tested products. Norton blocked all attempts to install malware on a clean system. Modifications made to the samples did not fool Norton. Norton was not able to block the installation of all the commercial keyloggers. Phishing protection blocked 90 percent of verified phishing websites in PC Magazine testing. Internet Explorer 7 caught 75 percent, and Firefox caught 60 percent. Norton stealthed all ports, according to PC Magazine. Port scans were unsuccessful. The firewall blocked all exploit attempts by Core Impact. Malware blocking and removal garnered good results in PC Magazine testing. All but one malware samples contained within a folder were removed once the folder was opened. The last one was removed when executed. Modifications made to the samples did not affect detection. On a similar test, specifically using commercial keyloggers, Norton did not successfully detect all. In removing threats, Norton almost completely removed 40 percent of the malware samples and related executables. Norton was also able to remove more commercial keyloggers than any other product. ===Version 2010 (17.x)=== Version 2010 was released officially on September 8, 2009. This version features a technology code named, Project Quorum, which introduces reputation-based threat detection to keep up with the 200 million attacks each month, many of which Symantec claims evade signature based detection. The new approach relies on Norton Community Watch, in which participants send information about the applications running on their computers. Safe applications exhibit common attributes, such as being of a known origin with known publishers. Conversely, new malware may have an unknown publisher, among other attributes. Using the data a \\"reputation score\\" is calculated and can be used to infer the likelihood of an unknown application being safe, or malicious. Other facets of Quorum are parental controls and spam filtering. Norton Internet Security 2010 bundles a free subscription of OnlineFamily.Norton, which PC Magazine found to be an improvement over the parental controls bundled with prior releases. Spam filtering uses technologies Symantec acquired from Brightmail. Two filters are used to find spam: a locally installed one and a check against Symantec's servers to see if the message is known spam. In PC Magazine testing, no valid e-mail were marked as spam. However, 11 percent of spam still made it to the inbox. This was a significant improvement over prior releases. Another improvement to the product is the improved heuristic feature called SONAR 2. It leverages reputation data to judge if a program is malicious or clean. Norton Insight has also been expanded, showing users the number of Norton Community participants who have a certain program installed, its impact of system resources, and how long it has been released. Information about the program's origin and a graph of its resource usage is also provided. A new feature codenamed \\"Autospy\\" helps users understand what Norton did when malware was found. The malware's actions and Norton's resolution are presented to the user. Previous releases removed threats on sight and quietly warned users, potentially confusing when users are deceived in downloading rogue security software. Another addition to the product is the new \\"Flip Screen\\". With a compatible graphics card, the main display \\"flips over\\" to show the opposite side of the main interface, consisting of a chart of CPU or memory usage and a timeline of security events. Without one, the \\"Flip Screen\\" link is replaced by a \\"back\\" link, which opens the back of the windows as a separate window. The product also adds a search engine labeled \\"Safe Search\\". The custom search allows the user to filter out unsafe sites, get insight on them, and keep track of HTTP cookies. Malware removal and blocking performed well, setting or meeting records in PC Magazine testing. It achieved a detection rate of 98%. The highest out of 12 tested antivirus products. The exception was blocking commercial keyloggers, where Norton made an above average score. File operations took 2 percent longer, and the file compression and extraction test took 4 percent longer. The only area where Norton introduced a significant delay was when the system was booting, the beta version of the suite added 31 percent to the boot time, significantly longer than prior versions. According to the Norton performance comparison website, Norton Internet Security scans 31 percent faster, is 70 percent lighter, and installs 76 percent faster than the leading Anti-virus product. According to AV-comparatives, Norton Internet Security was \\"Best Product of 2009\\",av-comparatives.org (24 December 2009), Antivirus Comparative Report 2009, retrieved 4 October 2012 Bronze award for 98.6% detection rate in 2010 and Norton Internet Security 2010 blocked 99/100 internet threats from infecting the user's computer.av-comparatives.org (16 December 2009), Whole Product Dynamic Test, retrieved 4 October 2012 ===Version 2011 (18.x)=== The old Norton logo before the merger. Norton Internet Security 2011 was released for Beta testing on April 21, 2010. Changes include a new user interface and improved scanning of internet sites for malware. With the 2011 version, Symantec also released an application that \\"scans\\" the user's Facebook feed for any malware links. This application does not require a valid subscription. In a test sponsoredDennis Technology Labs (3 August 2010), PC Anti-virus Protection 2009, retrieved 4 October 2012 by Symantec, Norton Internet Security 2011 was the only security suite to ever achieve a 100 percent protection score in a new third-party test from Dennis Labs. Improved reputation scan provides the user with an easy to understand interface on files stored on the user's computer. Marking them as trusted, good, poor, or bad. The final version of Norton Internet Security 2011 was released on August 31, 2010. New features in version 2011 also include Norton Rescue Tools. These tools include Norton Bootable Recovery tool and Norton Power Eraser. On December 9, 2010, Symantec released the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this update was later pulled due to numerous reports on the Norton forums that the update is causing system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this update are advised to uninstall the product, run the Norton Removal Tool, and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed the bugs and re-released the update. Following the acquisition of VeriSign Security by Norton's parent company Symantec, several of VeriSign's features were incorporated into the 2011 edition. The new product features a new Norton logo which uses the VeriSign checkmark formerly seen in VeriSign's own logo, as well as several new icon changes to the Norton Safe Web and Norton Identity Safe features. ===Version 2012 (19.x)=== Released (19.1.0.28) on September 6, 2011, Norton Internet Security 2012 brought new features. One of the new features included in the new release is Download Insight 2.0, which not only monitors files for safety but also the stability of a given file. That means that if a file is stable on Windows 7, but unstable on Windows XP, XP users will be notified of the file's instability. Enhanced removal tools are tightly integrated for better cleanup of already infected systems. Once triggered, the new, more powerful version of Norton Power Eraser restarts the system to locate and remove fake antivirus software fake antivirus software and other deeply embedded threats that are otherwise hard to remove. A new tool called Norton Management helps manage different computers and devices equipped with Norton software from a single location. Other changes in this release include SONAR 4, Google Chrome compatibility for Identity Safe and Safe Web and the ability to store passwords and notes in the cloud. However, the License Agreement does not guarantee passwords are stored securely and provides no remedy if the cloud vault is compromised. The user interface is also simplified with only three buttons. The third button opens a more advanced and complicated menu, where the user is able to manage settings and access different product features. The CPU meter that was removed from Norton 2011, also makes a return (only on the \\"advanced screen\\"). Combining the netbook and desktop line, Norton Internet Security integrates Bandwidth metering, which controls the product's traffic usage and takes it down to minimum if necessary. This is ideal for networks with limited traffic. Also, the user interface window adjusts accordingly to the size of the computer screen. This version of Norton Internet Security includes several Easter eggs. Pressing Shift+1, 2, 3 or 4 would change the theme to default background (plain black), ray, animals, and floral respectively. Also holding Control + Win Key + Alt while pressing \\"performance button\\" to activate \\"Crazy Flip\\", which will make the window flip head over heels. The effect would continue until the main window is closed and reopened. Furthermore, scans are no longer scheduled through the Windows Task Scheduler, but through the Symantec's proprietary one, which performs tasks while the computer is idle (i.e., when the user is away from the computer). ===Version 20.x (2013)=== Version 20 (2013) began a \\"Version-less\\" approach by dropping the 20xx naming convention, and will automatically update itself as new releases become available. Notable changes include a new user interface better suited for touchscreen devices, \\"Social Networking Protection,\\" which intends to protect against threats targeted at social networks, and was also the first release to officially support Windows 8. ===Version 21.x (2014)=== This version, released on October 7, 2013, became the last version to be marketed by Symantec. Norton Internet Security, along with Norton Antivirus and Norton 360, have been replaced with Norton Security. ===Version 22.x (2015)=== A version 22.5 update was released in June 2015. It includes a restyled user interface and Windows 10 Support. ===Norton Security=== In September 2014 Norton Internet Security was folded into Norton Security, as part of Symantec's streamlined Norton line. ==Netbook edition== Symantec has released a special edition of Norton Internet Security optimized for netbooks. This is available as download from the Symantec website or in a USB thumb drive. Symantec states that the Netbook edition is optimized for netbooks. The main display is optimized to provide support for the 800 x 480 screen resolution. In addition, non-critical tasks are delayed while the netbook is on battery. Furthermore, the Netbook edition contains complimentary access to Norton's secure online backup and parental control to protect children as they surf the web. ==Macintosh edition== ===Version 1.0=== Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was released November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, and the ability to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor. ===Version 2.0=== Norton Internet Security version 2.0 for Mac was released on ( date unknown if you know please provide it). Version 2.0 also ties in with the WHOIS database, allowing users to trace attacking computers. Users can inform network administrators of the attacking computers for corrective actions. When running under Mac OS 8.1 or 9, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under Mac OS X 10.1, a PowerPC G3 processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. ===Version 3.0=== Norton Internet Security version 3.0 for Mac was released on ( date unknown if you know please provide it). The subsequent release, version 3.0, maintained the feature set found in version 2.0. The firewall now allocates internet access as needed rather than relying on user input using predefined rules. Compatibility with OS 8 was dropped. When running under OS 9.2, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under OS X 10.1.5 through 10.3, a PowerPC G3, 128 MB of RAM, and 150 MB of free space is required. However, version 3.0 is not compatible with Mac OS X 10.4, or \\"Tiger\\". ===Version 4.0=== Version 4.0 was released on December 18, 2008. Symantec also markets a bundle of Version 4.0 and the 2009 version for Windows, intended for users with both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installed. iClean was dropped from this release. The firewall now blocks access to malicious sites using a blacklist updated by Symantec. To prevent attackers from leveraging insecurities in the Mac or installed software, exploit protection was introduced in this release. Phishing protection was introduced in this release as well. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. A PowerPC or Intel Core processor, 256 MB of RAM and 150 MB of free space are required. ===Version 5.0=== Features *Norton Safe Web: Proactively protects you while you surf the Web by warning you of and blocking unsafe and fake websites right in your search results.

Norton products now have only two running processes, using about 15 MB of RAM.Passmark Software (17 August 2011), 2012 Consumer Security Products Performance Benchmarks (Edition 1), retrieved 4 October 2011 According to PassMark Security Benchmark 2012,PassMark Security Benchmark 2012 Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security are the lightest suites available. AV-Comparatives.org also tested these products and gave similar results.Passmark Software (17 August 2011), 2012 Consumer Security Products Performance Benchmarks (Edition 1), retrieved 4 October 2011 PC Magazine recognized the 2011 and 2012 lines as the fastest and strongest in protection. PCWorld's tests of security software put Norton Internet Security 2009 in first place. In a 2011 test conducted by PC World, Norton Internet Security was the winner. Dennis Technology Labs (in tests sponsored by Symantec) confirmed the performance and effectiveness of Norton 2011 and 2012 lines.Dennis Technology Labs (26 January 2011), PC Total Protection Suites 2011 - A Dynamic Anti-Malware Comparison Test, retrieved 4 October 2012 ==Criticism of older versions before 2009== ===FBI cooperation=== Symantec, in compliance with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), whitelisted Magic Lantern, a keylogger actively developed by the FBI. The purpose of Magic Lantern is to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on November 20, 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press.Ted Bridis. \\"FBI Develops Eavesdropping Tools,\\" Washington Post, November 22, 2001. Magic Lantern is deployed as an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, a trojan horse is installed on the suspect's computer. The Trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting it. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law. Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from Sophos, said, \\"We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn’t know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party\\". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, \\"Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools.\\" FBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response to the question of whether Magic Lantern needed a court order to be deployed, said, \\"Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process.\\" Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Unlike a predecessor, Carnivore, implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, which would necessitate a court order. ===Uninstallation=== Older versions of Norton were hard and slow to uninstall, leaving many traces and sometimes completing with errors. However, in the 2009 versions, Symantec featured their own uninstaller, that removes their products better and more quickly, usually in less than a minute. Norton Removal Tool is a well known instrument that removes Norton products completely, without any trace. The tool can be downloaded from Symantec's website].Symantec's website Symantec reports that Norton 2010 range of products feature a cleaner uninstall and over-installs is the recommended update route to 2011. Link ===Windows Service Packs=== When Norton Internet Security 2008 is installed, users may encounter incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users report numerous invalid registry keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters. Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility. Dave Cole, Symantec's Vice President & General Manager, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done \\"extensive testing\\" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue was not encountered. Cole blamed Microsoft \\"This is related to XP SP3.\\" Microsoft recommended that users contact Windows customer support. To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading. Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect. A tool to remove the added registry entries is also available from Symantec. ===Windows Vista=== Sarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel, a part of an operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits often hide in an operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, \\"The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous\\", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions. ==See also== * Internet security * Comparison of antivirus software * Comparison of firewalls * Peter Norton * Norton Antivirus * Norton 360 ==References== ==External links== *Official website **Norton Internet Security For Windows **Norton Internet Security For Mac **Norton Partner Portal Category:Symantec software Category:Antivirus software Category:Proprietary software pt:Norton AntiVírus ","title":"Norton Internet Security"},{"id":"1439429","text":"Chadwick Everett Brown (born July 12, 1970) is a former American football linebacker of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 1993 NFL Draft. He played college football at Colorado. ==Early life and college== Born in Altadena, California, Brown graduated from John Muir High School in 1988. At the University of Colorado, Brown was a four-year starter on the Colorado Buffaloes football team. ==Professional career== Brown was initially drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round, and became an important part of the \\"Blitzburgh\\" defense. Initially, he played at the inside linebacker position in the 3-4 with Levon Kirkland. He started at right inside linebacker in Super Bowl XXX for the Steelers, a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He then moved to the outside when Greg Lloyd was lost for the 1996 season due to injury, where he went to his first Pro Bowl after that season. His success would continue with the Seattle Seahawks, going to two more Pro Bowls in the 1990s. He signed with the Patriots as a replacement for injured inside linebacker Tedy Bruschi in 2005. After several games of what was thought to be subpar performance at his new position, Brown spent most of the rest of the season only on special teams. In September of 2006, after re-signing with the Patriots, Brown was released by the Patriots as one of their final cuts. He then signed with the Steelers and finished the season on their injured reserve. On July 19, 2007, he re-joined the Patriots but was released on September 1, 2007. On September 11, 2007, the Pats re-signed him, and released him again on October 10, 2007. Brown was re- signed by the Patriots yet again on November 27, 2007, after linebacker Rosevelt Colvin was placed on season-ending injured reserve. He was released on December 27, 2007, before the Patriots became AFC champions for the season in Super Bowl XLII. ==Broadcasting career== Since retiring as a player, Brown has worked as a color analyst and sideline reporter for college and NFL football on a variety of networks, including Compass Media Networks, the Pac-12 Network, ESPN3, Westwood One, and NBCSN. ==Personal life== Since his NFL career began, Brown has also operated a business named Pro Exotics that sells non-venomous snakes. ==References== ==External links== *New England Patriots bio Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Altadena, California Category:American football linebackers Category:Colorado Buffaloes football players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles County, California Category:New England Patriots players Category:Players of American football from California Category:College football announcers Category:National Football League announcers ","title":"Chad Brown (linebacker)"},{"id":"1439435","text":"April Dawn Heinrichs (born February 27, 1964) is an American former soccer player and coach.

Grosvenor first began playing in local bands in his hometown of Evesham. He met Jim Capaldi, who later played with Traffic, with whom he formed a group called Deep Feelin. Later he joined a group called The V.I.P.'s, in which Keith Emerson played for some time. The V.I.P.'s were renamed Art and later became Spooky Tooth. After leaving Spooky Tooth, he released a solo album, Under Open Skies (Island Records, 1971). For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender at the suggestion of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul for his stint with the Mott the Hoople. According to Mott's lead singer Ian Hunter, interviewed in the documentary The Ballad of Mott the Hoople, the band were in Germany with Lynsey de Paul for the TV show, Hits-a-Go-Go in Germany on 24 June 1973 when lead guitarist Mick Ralphs walked down a street bending a succession of car aerials in frustration. De Paul came out with the phrase \\"aerial bender\\" which Hunter later suggested to Grosvenor as a stage name.Ballad of Mott the Hoople documentary, c. 39:30 Grosvenor joined the band in 1973, replacing Ralphs. Grosvenor toured with Mott in 1973 and 1974 and performed on the band's seventh album, The Hoople (1974). The years with Spooky Tooth (1967 to 1970), Stealers Wheel (1973) and Mott the Hoople (1973 to 1974) were the most successful years in Grosvenor's musical career. After leaving Mott in 1974 - he was replaced by Mick Ronson - Grosvenor published a few solo albums, and formed Widowmaker, releasing Widowmaker in 1976 and Too Late to Cry in 1977.

The album again featured Mike Kellie on drums & featured Jess Roden singing vocals on two tracks, Luther did the vocals on the rest of the album. The album was produced by Luther & Mick Dolan who produced albums for Steve Winwood. In 1999 Grosvenor returned in a Spooky Tooth reunion (sans Gary Wright), \\"Cross Purpose\\" again for the Brilliant Recording Company.In actuality it was more of a VIP's release other than Spooky Tooth. In 2005, he revived his pseudonym, forming the Ariel Bender Band. In 2007 and 2008 he performed under the name Ariel Bender's Mott The Hoople performing both Spooky Tooth and Mott The Hoople songs, as well as cover songs. In 2009, he worked with London act, The Winter Olympics, recording guitar parts for their song, \\"The Great Outdoors\\", which was released in August 2010.

Datastream is a wholesale product in which the wholesale customer can purchase connectivity between their own point of presence and a number of end users. Some authors use the term \\"datastream\\" for replacing the term dataflow to avoid confusion with dataflow computing or dataflow architecture, based on an indeterministic machine paradigm (a research scene which is dead meanwhile). == Technical details == The connections between the end users and the Other Logical Operator (OLO) (the wholesale customer of the DataStream product) were provided in three parts. # BT provided connectivity between the end user and the nearest BT Serving Exchange via asymmetric digital subscriber line, symmetric digital subscriber line, and fibre to the x. The end user access line could have a bandwidth ranging between 288 kbit/s and 8,128 kbit/s (8 Mibit/s) downstream and up to 832 kbit/s upstream for Asymmetric digital subscriber line, and up to 2048 kbit/s (2 Mibit/s) for Symmetric digital subscriber line. For fibre-based connections, speeds can be as high as 100 Mbit/s although most connections of this type are fibre from exchange to cabinet so therefore limited to a maximum of 40 Mbit/s. # For each serving exchange involved in providing end user access lines, a virtual path is provisioned to a BT ATM switch on BT's core network. A virtual path can range in size from 250 kbit/s to 34 Mbit/s. One or more Digital Subscriber Line Digital Multiplexers at the serving exchange combine the traffic from the end user access lines for delivery to the ATM switch. # From the BT switch, the traffic from the various virtual paths is combined and an ATM Customer Access Link (CAL) is used to connect to the Network Terminating Equipment (NTE) at the wholesale customer's point of presence. == Comparison to IPStream and LLU == IPstream, DataStream, and local loop unbundling (LLU) are all products that can be used for the delivery of bit-stream products, but represent different degrees of involvement from BT. In the case of LLU, the OLO has direct access to the twisted pair delivered to the end-user's NTE and has near total control of the connection from end-to-end. With DataStream, BT still manages the DSL multiplexing equipment at the various local exchanges, and hands off the aggregated traffic to the OLO at one or a few points of presence.

It was the debut film of Bennett Miller, who became prominent after directing Capote (2005). The film records the worldview and personality of Timothy \\"Speed\\" Levitch, who was then a guide for bus tours of New York City. Levitch had become popular for his unconventional narrative about the city that he delivered at a frenetic pace. ==Production== The production of the film has also drawn critical commentary. James Berardinelli wrote, \\"'The Cruise' is a typical example of low-budget documentary film making. It's in grainy black-and-white (a blowup from the video it was shot on) with a flat audio. Oddly, however, this approach gives Levitch's New York a timeless quality. The Gershwin song \\"But Not for Me\\" plays as the camera captures the modern skyline, creating a sense of the past and present blurring together. The film was in production for 3.5 years and Miller worked as a one-man camera crew, solely operating a handheld video camera, a wireless microphone on Levitch, and a Sennheiser shotgun microphone that was collapsible and thus easily transportable. Miller discarded the first 80 hours of footage he captured of Levitch only to start from scratch. Levitch reportedly chose not to sit in on the majority of the editing process, choosing instead to stick to his core principles: to succumb to the chaos of the universe. The production team, including editor Michael Levine, spent 8 months editing the film. ==Release== The Cruise was initially rejected by many film festivals. It premiered at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival in 1998 and was later screened at New York's Docfest. On October 14, 1998, The Cruise was released in New York City at the Angelika Film Center. After being picked up by distributor Artisan Entertainment, it was released nationwide on November 6, 1998. The Cruise was released to DVD in 2006. ==Reception== At the time of the film's release, Stephen Holden wrote, \\"Filmed in high-contrast black and white that makes the city look harshly magnificent, at once irresistible and forbidding, The Cruise could be described as a whirlwind tour both of New York and of Levitch's feverish mind.\\" Following the film's release to DVD in 2006, Brett Cullum wrote, \\"Although we do get to see some familiar sites, including winsome glimpses of the World Trade Center towers, the camera hardly ever leaves the face of our tour guide. This is all one extended character study, and is not concerned with narrative or sight seeing. No, this is a dadaist manifesto delivered off the pavement leading to the Brooklyn bridge. It runs like an hour of poetic jazz—verbal scats and flourishes aplenty.\\" The Cruise was nominated for several awards, including Best Documentary from the Online Film Critics Society and the Satellite Awards. Michael Levine, the film's editor, was nominated for the Best Edited Documentary Film award (\\"Eddie\\") by the American Cinema Editors. \\"The Cruise\\" was also nominated for the Daring Digital Award at the Jeonju Film Festival. It won the Wolfgang Statuote Award and the Don Quixote Award at the Berlin International Film Festival, demonstrating the film's international diffusion, and the Best Documentary Audience Award and the Feature Competition Special Jury Award at the Newport International Film Festival. ==References== ==Further reading== * Quotes of Levitch from the film. * Interview with Bennett Miller and Timothy \\"Speed\\" Levitch. ==External links== * * www.speedlevitchonline.com: The official website of Timothy Speed Levitch Category:1998 films Category:Artisan Entertainment films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about actors Category:1998 documentary films Category:Documentary films about New York City Category:Films directed by Bennett Miller Category:1998 directorial debut films ","title":"The Cruise (1998 film)"},{"id":"1439500","text":"Jericho is the eighth studio album by Canadian-American rock group the Band. Coming seventeen years after their \\"farewell concert\\", it was released in 1993 and was the first album to feature the latter-day configuration of the group, as well as their first release for the Rhino subsidiary Pyramid Records. Joining original members Levon Helm (drums/mandolin/guitar/vocal), Rick Danko (bass/guitar/vocal) and Garth Hudson (organ/keyboards/horns) were Jim Weider (who had played guitar for the group from the time of their 1983 reformation), Randy Ciarlante (who had joined on drums in 1990) and Richard Bell (who had joined as keyboardist in 1991). There were an additional fourteen guest musicians. Having so many guests would be commonplace on the latter-day group's albums. ==Recording== In 1985, the Band went into the studio for the first time since 1977 with the intent of recording tracks for an eventual album. Richard Manuel had recently expressed interest in writing new material for the group, and had written \\"Breaking New Ground\\" with Gerry Goffin and Carole King. However, on March 6, 1986, Manuel was found dead of suicide, and the Band abandoned efforts to make an album for several years. In 1990, Sony offered the Band a recording contract. The group hired fellow Hawks member Stan Szelest to replace Manuel on keyboards, and proceeded to record new material with songwriter Jules Shear. However, these recordings were rejected by Sony, which suggested the group take submissions from various songwriters. Just as recording continued, Szelest died of a heart attack. The Band then requested release from Sony and found a new contract with Great Pyramid Records. Without Manuel or Robbie Robertson as songwriters, the group relied mostly on outside sources, such as Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Bruce Springsteen, and their friends Bob Dylan and Artie Traum. A few sessions also involved Champion Jack Dupree. \\"Country Boy\\", a song from the 1985 sessions with Manuel on vocals, was also selected for inclusion on the album. John Simon, who had produced the Band's first two albums, was again brought in to produce along with Aaron L. Hurwitz (Engineer, Record Producer),http://theband.hiof.no/albums/jericho.html to form the collection which would ultimately become Jericho. The album was finally completed in 1993, with new members Richard Bell, Randy Ciarlante and Jim Weider on keyboards, second drums and lead guitar respectively. ==Cover== The album cover is a painting by Peter Max of the \\"Big Pink\\" house in West Saugerties, New York, where Bob Dylan and the Band recorded music during the mid to late 1960s. The albums The Basement Tapes and Music from Big Pink both originated from the music created in this house. The painting depicts the same view of the house used in the photographs on the cover of Music from Big Pink. ==Track listing== ==Reception== Mark Deming of AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5.

He said though initially he was hesitant to take up the responsibility, the then RSS Sarsanghachalak M. S. Golwalkar helped him to make up his mind. \\"I was able to discharge my duties because people senior to me fully co-operated with me,\\" he said. A strong votary of swadeshi, he was seen as one of the hard-liners within the RSS. He had often criticised the National Democratic Alliance government in general and the Bharatiya Janata Party in particular for its economic policies. In 2005, his statements suggesting that both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L. K. Advani step aside and let a younger leadership take charge of the BJP created a rift within the Sangh parivar. He stepped down as Sarsanghachalak on 21 March 2009, due to poor health. He was popularly known in Sangh circles as \\"Sudarshan Ji\\". He died at the age of 81 in Raipur on 15 September 2012. == References == Category:1931 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Sarsanghchalaks Category:People from Raipur, Chhattisgarh Category:Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh sanghchalaks Category:Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharaks ","title":"K.

He received the kingdom of Austrasia plus the cities (civitates) of Poitiers, Tours, Le Puy-en-Velay, Bordeaux, and Châteaudun, as well as the Champagne, the Auvergne, and Transjurane Alemannia. During his early years, his grandmother Brunhilda ruled for Theudebert and his brother Theuderic II, who had received the realm of Burgundy. After the two brothers reached adulthood, they were often at war, with Brunhilda siding with Theuderic. In 599, Theuderic defeated Theudebert at Sens, but then the two brothers allied against their cousin Chlothar II and defeated him at Dormelles (near Montereau), thereby laying their hands on a great portion of Neustria (600-604). At this point, however, the two brothers took up arms against each other; Theuderic defeated Theudebert at Étampes and he refused to aid his brother when Theuderic's kingdom was invaded by Clothar II in 605. In 610, he extorted Alsace from his brother and Theuderic took up arms against him, yet again.

Until 2008, he was a member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Mississauga—Streetsville as a Conservative Member of Parliament. In March 2018, he was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and charged with three counts of fraud, three counts of false pretense and one count of uttering a forged document. ==Early life== Khan served as an officer and a pilot in the Pakistan Air Force from 1966 to 1973.Turley-ewart, John. National Post,For Liberals, the wrong kind of Muslim, January 10, 2007 He took part in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 as a Shenyang J-6 fighter pilot. He moved to Toronto, Canada in 1974. ==Political career== Khan entered politics as a member of the Liberal Party, and supported Paul Martin for the party leadership in 2003. He was elected with over 50% support in Mississauga—Streetsville in the 2004 federal election, defeating Conservative Nina Tangri by nearly a 20 percentage point margin. Along with Yasmin Ratansi, Khan was the first Muslim Member of Parliament (MP) to be elected for the Liberal Party. Khan voted against his government's same-sex marriage bill on June 28, 2005. Khan was re-elected in the 2006 federal election, defeating Conservative Raminder Gill by an 11% margin. After his reelection, he was appointed Associate Critic for National Defence, and more recently Associate Critic for Treasury Board. Khan initially supported Joe Volpe in the 2006 Liberal leadership campaign, and later joined Volpe in throwing his support behind Bob Rae. As a Liberal, Khan voted against the extension of Canada's combat mission in Afghanistan until 2009. ===Relationship with Qayyum Jamal=== When Khan began attending the Ar-Rahman mosque in the summer of 2005, Qayyum Jamal introduced him to the congregation saying that he had come to bring messages from the government, and countered that he would like to send the government a message of his own - that Canadian troops in Afghanistan were not doing any good. Khan interrupted Jamal to state that such comments would not be tolerated, before walking out of the mosque angrily. Khan later referred to the altercation, saying he pushed Jamal aside because he was \\"speaking nonsense\\" and referred to him as an \\"idiot\\" with \\"piss-poor\\" command of the English language. Khan, who had been chastised by Jamal's wife in the past,Jihad Unspun - Conceived In A Seething Cauldron: The History Of Hizbullah later reported Jamal's behaviour to the authorities, leading to his being charged in the as the ringleader of a Toronto terrorism plot, and jailed for two years before being found innocent.Stewart, John. Mississauga News MP Khan argued with accused terrorist, June 5, 2006 Macleans later reported that \\"the possibility that a member of Parliament was among those who raised the alarm about Jamal is an intriging twist in the complex story of how police built their case leading to the arrests\\".Geddes, John. Macleans, Wajid Khan: 'I did my duty' , June 14, 2006 ===Advisor for the Middle East and Afghanistan=== He was appointed as special advisor to Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the Middle East and Afghanistan on August 8, 2006. In response to criticisms about providing support for his Conservative political opponents, Khan emphasized the non-partisan nature of his appointment, noting that he sought and received the approval of Liberal leader Bill Graham prior to taking on the responsibility. Khan was sent to the Middle East on a 16-day trip to prepare a report on conditions there; before departing, he promised that the report would be made public upon his return, a promise which later became a point of contention. ===Crosses the floor=== Early in January 2007, media outlets began reporting speculation that Khan was considering crossing the floor to join the Conservative Party. Liberal leader Stéphane Dion had stated that he would not permit Khan to continue in his role as an advisor to Stephen Harper while sitting as a Liberal MP. On January 5, Khan crossed the floor to the Conservatives. Following his defection to the Tories, there were calls from Khan's former Liberal colleagues for his Middle East report to be made public as promised; however, Prime Minister Harper refused this, saying that publication of the report would make Khan \\"a pundit and not an advisor.\\" On January 15, 2007 it was revealed that Khan's old Liberal riding association had been de-registered by Elections Canada effective December 31, 2006. Khan's businesses lent nearly $180,000 to the riding association in a two-year period. While loans to riding associations are permissible, the magnitude of the loans from Khan's business was considered highly unusual. However, Elections Canada ruled that no wrongdoing had been committed by Khan. On November 15, 2007, Khan was charged under the Elections Act with overspending by $30,000 in the previous election campaign. Khan, his business, and his riding president were also charged with election spending unauthorized by his official agent. On November 23, 2007, he announced that he would withdraw from the Conservative caucus and sit as an Independent MP.\\"Ontario Tory MP charged under the Elections Act\\" , Canadian Press, 23 November 2007. On February 3, 2008, Chief Government Whip Jay Hill announced that Khan had fully concluded the matter with Elections Canada and had been readmitted to the Conservative caucus.\\"Conservatives welcome Khan back into the fold\\" , Ottawa Citizen, 3 February 2008. In the October 14, 2008 federal election, Khan lost his reelection bid to Liberal candidate Bonnie Crombie by 4,725 votes. === Criminal charges === In March 2018, Khan and his business partner, Nadeem Imtiaz Ahmed of Mississauga, Ontario, were arrested and charged by RCMP in an investment fraud scheme. The RCMP Sensitive and International Investigative Section, which focuses on “criminal activity that poses a threat to Canada’s government institutions, public officials, the integrity of the Crown, or that imperils Canada’s political, economic and social integrity,” began an investigation into the matter in early 2015. After a nearly 3-year investigation by the RCMP's financial crimes unit, Khan was charged with three counts of fraud, three counts of false pretense and one count of uttering a forged document in relation to a scheme to use the money for investment properties in Pakistan. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian Muslims Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Independent MPs in the Canadian House of Commons Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Pakistani emigrants to Canada Category:Pakistan Air Force officers Category:Canadian politicians of Pakistani descent Category:Canadian businesspeople of Pakistani descent Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Edwardes College alumni Category:Shot-down aviators Category:Pakistani prisoners of war ","title":"Wajid Khan (Canadian politician)"},{"id":"1439575","text":"Sylvain Cossette (born May 8, 1963) is a French-Canadian singer-songwriter from Grand-Mère, Quebec (located in the Mauricie region).

Glyder Fawr, to the north, is also accessible from here. Situated at the high point of the Llanberis Pass at an altitude of , (about a third of the height of Snowdon) the road was built in the 1830s to allow ore from the mines on Snowdon to be transported to Llanberis.

The film was directed by Maurice Joyce, and stars the regular television cast of Tom McHugh, Fred Newman, Chris Phillips, Constance Shulman, Frank Welker, Alice Playten, Guy Hadley, and Doris Belack. It was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and Jumbo Pictures with animation provided by Plus One Animation, and released by Buena Vista Pictures on March 26, 1999. The film received mixed to negative reviews, who criticized its plot, writing, and character development. However, the voice acting, ending and animation was praised. Despite the title and its success at the box office, no further films based on Doug were made. It serves as the series finale of the entire Doug series for Nickelodeon and Disney. ==Plot== Doug and Skeeter discover a monster that lives in Lucky Duck Lake. At first they are scared of him, but later they find he is nice. Bill Bluff is polluting the lake, and the pollution created this monster. The Monster almost eats the book Moby Dick but Skeeter stops him, and they named him Herman for the book's author, Herman Melville. Doug remembers that he was supposed to meet Patti at Mr. Swirly's. He runs to Swirly's as fast as he can using the quickest short-cuts that he knew. Once he gets there, he does not see Patti. Mr. Swirly says the she was there and looked very upset, and then left with a guy who kept talking about his big plans for a dance. When Doug heard this, he knew that this guy was no one else but Guy Grahm, a snobby upper class-man who wants Patti. Meanwhile, Roger and the A/V nerds are building a robot to kidnap Herman, but when they build the robot it acts like Roger's babysitter. Doug then rushes to the Funkytown night club, where Guy and Patti are working on the dance. He apologizes to Patti there and she accepts his apology. But Guy cuts in and says that Doug is just a stupid little kid. Doug, very angry now, says that he has proof that Bluff is evil and is polluting the lake. Guy calls Doug a liar. Doug then invites them both to the announcement to be held in front of Mr. Dink's house about Herman and the pollution, with Doug knowing he can trust Mr. Dink since his wife is the current mayor of Bluffington. Doug leaves, but the picture of the monster falls out of his pocket without him knowing. Guy realizes that Doug was telling the truth. Guy calls Bluff, who he is tight with. Then at the announcement, Doug sees that a news reporter's camera is inflatable. He realizes that the news company is a fake, that it is supporting Bill Bluff and trying to compensate Bluff to cover up the monster and Bluffco's polluting of Lucky Duck Lake. Doug then has to tell everyone that there has been a mistake, Patti gets mad at him, thinks that he is a liar and walks away with Guy. That night, Bluff finds the boys with Herman and kidnaps the monster. The next morning, Doug knows that this is his last chance to save Herman. He goes to the school newspaper room, hoping to find Guy who can lead him to Bluff. Guy isn't in the room, but Doug sees a newspaper article that says that Mr. Bluff and his men blast a monster to smithereens at a school dance. Doug is at first sad and believes that Herman has died, but he than realizes that the school dance is not until tonight and this is what is being planned to happen so, Doug and Skeeter call Roger and The Sleech twins to help. At the school dance, he has to make the biggest choice of his life, going after Patti or saving Herman. When he does that, Bluff catches Doug and Skeeter in front of Crystal Lake after Herman escapes into it and starts to enslave them, promising to make their lives a living nightmare, but is silenced and told off by his own daughter Beebe, who defends her friends, before then being confronted by Mrs. Dink, who hints at Bluff facing a massive lawsuit from the federal government for polluting Lucky Duck Lake that could bankrupt him and Bluffco unless he agrees to clean up the lake. With little choice, Bluff concedes to clean up the lake to save his own neck, and is left crawling on his knees after Beebe, begging for her forgiveness. Doug then finds Patti in front of the woods and Doug tries to tell her he is in love with her but is interrupted by Herman, who proves that Doug had been telling the truth and Guy lied to Patti, leading to Patti dumping Guy in fury for his deception. Then, the kids say goodbye to Herman. After Herman jumps back into the lake, Doug tells Patti he likes her and Roger almost becomes friends with Doug but is interrupted by the robot. ==Voice cast== * Tom McHugh as Doug Funnie, Lincoln * Fred Newman as Skeeter Valentine, Mr. Dink, Porkchop, Ned * Chris Phillips as Roger Klotz, Boomer, Larry, Mr. Chiminy * Constance Shulman as Patti Mayonnaise * Frank Welker as Herman Melville * Alice Playten as Beebe Bluff, Elmo (this would be her final role in an animated movie before her death in 2011) * Guy Hadley as Guy Graham * Doug Preis as Mr. Funnie, Mr. Bluff, Willie, Chalky, Bluff Agent * Eddie Korbich as Al & Moo Sleech, Robocrusher * David O'Brien as Quailman Announcer * Doris Belack as Mayor Tippi Dink * Becca Lish as Judy Funnie, Mrs. Funnie, Connie * Greg Lee as Principal White * Bob Bottone as Bluff Assistant * Bruce Bayley Johnson as Mr. Swirly * Fran Brill as Mrs. Elaine Perigrew * Melissa Greenspan as Briar Langolier ===Additional voice artists=== * Rodger Bumpass as Green Police Officer * Paul Eiding as Red Police Officer * Jackie Gonneau as Kid #1 * Sherry Lynn as Kid #2 * Mickie McGowan as Lunch Lady * Phil Proctor as Brian the A/V Nerd * Brianne Siddall as Kid #3 * Claudette Wells as Kid #4 ==Production== Nickelodeon was originally planning a Doug film in 1993 when they made a deal with 20th Century Fox to make films based on their properties along with films like Rugrats and Ren & Stimpy. However, the plans evaporated when the deal expired in 1995. Only The Rugrats Movie materialized, by Paramount Pictures, in November 1998. In 1996, when Disney bought Jumbo Pictures along with the cartoon, they decided to re-circle the project for the Doug film. This film was originally planned as a direct-to-video release under the title The First Doug Movie Ever as shown in trailers, but due to the success of The Rugrats Movie, they decided to make it a theatrical release. This is the last American theatrical animated film to use traditional cels, in which the title sequence of the film used digital ink and paint. ==Release== The film was theatrically released with the short \\"Opera Box\\", featuring Donald and Daisy Duck, from the television series Mickey Mouse Works. ===Critical reception=== The film garnered a 26% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with 9 of a total 34 reviews being determined as positive. The critical consensus reads, \\"Doug's 1st Movie may entertain very young fans of its main character, but essentially amounts to a forgettable feature-length episode of his show.\\" Critics were harsh to Doug's 1st Movie when it was released theatrically. Many noted that the film felt too much like an extended episode of the show (story and animation-wise) and many mention that the film should have stayed a direct-to-video release. Most of the criticism came from the plot, writing, music, though they praised the animation, voice acting and ending. Screenit.com awarded the film 4 out of 10, determining that it was mediocre and did not have \\"that magic or cinematic feel to warrant the big screen treatment\\" and it felt like the regular series. ===Box office=== Doug's 1st Movie opened at #5 in its opening weekend with $4,470,489, for an average of $1,971 from a very wide 2,268 theaters. While this may be deemed as low for an average Hollywood film, Doug only cost $5 million to make due to its direct-to-video budget and a somewhat low-key promotional campaign. As such, the film still managed to gross $19,421,271 in ticket sales, creating a large profit for Disney and making it a box office success. ===Awards and nominations=== The film was nominated for a Stinker Award for Worst Achievement in Animation. ===Home media=== The film was released on VHS on September 21, 1999, and on DVD as a Disney Movie Club exclusive on July 20, 2012. The DVD used a TV edit when it was aired in Australia on the Seven Network with fade-ins and fade-outs in some parts to make way for the commercial breaks and the closing credits were sped up to fit the time slot. The film, along with Disney’s Doug, was released on Disney+ on November 12, 2019, its first day of release. This version of the film did not use the TV edit found on the DVD release, allowing the end credits to be seen at their intended speed. ==References* * Category:1999 films Category:1999 animated films Category:1990s American animated films Category:1990s children's comedy films Category:American films Category:Animated films based on animated series Category:American children's animated comedy films Category:Disney animated films Category:DisneyToon Studios animated films Category:Films based on television series Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:Disney Television Animation films Category:1999 directorial debut films Category:1999 comedy films ","title":"Doug's 1st Movie"},{"id":"1439607","text":"A currency band is a range of values for the exchange rate for a country’s currency which the country’s central bank acts to keep the exchange rate within.

The Burgundian kingdom of Guntram (pink) was inherited first by Childebert II and then by Theuderic II. Theuderic II (also Theuderich, Theoderic, or Theodoric; in French, Thierry) (587–613), king of Burgundy (595–613) and Austrasia (612–613), was the second son of Childebert II. At his father's death in 595, he received Guntram's kingdom of Burgundy, with its capital at Orléans, while his elder brother, Theudebert II, received their father's kingdom of Austrasia, with its capital at Metz. He also received the lordship of the cities (civitates) of Toulouse, Agen, Nantes, Angers, Saintes, Angoulême, Périgueux, Blois, Chartres, and Le Mans. During his minority, and later, he reigned under the guidance of his grandmother Brunhilda, evicted from Austrasia by his brother Theudebert II. In 596, Clotaire II, king of Neustria, and Fredegund, Clotaire's mother, took Paris, which was supposed to be held in common. Fredegund, then her son's regent, sent a force to Laffaux and the armies of Theudebert and Theuderic were defeated. In 599, Brunhilda was forced out of Austrasia by Theudebert and she was found wandering near Arcis in Champagne by a peasant, who brought her to Theuderic. The peasant was supposedly rewarded with the bishopric of Auxerre. Theuderic welcomed her and readily fell under her influence, which was inclined to vengeful war with Theudebert at the time. Soon, Theuderic and his brother were at war. He defeated Theudebert at Sens, but their cousin Clotaire's restless warmaking prompted them to ally against him. They resumed the fight against Neustria and, in 600, defeated Clotaire at Dormelles (near Montereau) on the Orvanne. The land between the Seine and the Oise was divided between Theuderic and Theudebert, with Theuderic receiving the territory between the Seine and the Loire including the Breton frontier. They also campaigned together in Gascony, where they subjugated the local population and instated Genialis as duke. At this point, however, the two brothers took up arms against each other resulting in Theuderic's defeat of Theudebert at Étampes. Theuderic's kingdom was invaded by Clotaire in 604, and was also confronted by Clotaire's son Merovech and his mayor Landric. Theuderic met them at Étampes on the Louet, but Theudebert refused him aid. Theuderic won the day, but his mayor of the palace, Berthoald was killed. The next mayor, Protadius, a partisan of Brunhilda, encouraged war with Austrasia, but the nobles assassinated him and battle was never met, a pact being enforced by Theuderic's men. In 610, he lost Alsace, the Saintois, the Thurgau, and Champagne to his brother and his men east of the Jura were soundly defeated by the Alemanni. However, he routed Theudebert at Toul (c.611) and later at Tolbiac in 612. He captured the fleeing Theudebert in the latter battle and gave him over--after taking his royal paraphernalia--to his grandmother Brunhilda, who had him put up in a monastery.

Funeral Dirge for the Rotting Sun appeared in 2003 before the band jumped to Metal Blade for the fall release of 2006's A Haunting Curse. They performed at both Ozzfest 2008 and Ozzfest 2010. In 2009, Goatwhore released their fourth album, entitled Carving out the Eyes of God, and toured with Obituary, among others. In January and February 2010, Goatwhore embarked on the 'Bound By The Road' Tour with DevilDriver, Suffocation, and Thy Will Be Done. In 2010, the band was confirmed as being part of the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games' 2010 remake of Splatterhouse. In early 2012, the band released their fifth album, entitled Blood for the Master.

In general, for a given scale S, the scalar transpositions of a line L can be grouped into categories, or transpositional set classes, whose members are related by chromatic transposition.

He worked mainly for Raidió Teilifís Éireann, and was the first Irish celebrity to die from an AIDS-related illness. He has been described as \\"Ireland's first gay celebrity.\\" Hanley began presenting pop music shows on RTÉ Radio Cork in 1976. He also did stints in Dublin on RTÉ Radio 1 and RTÉ television, including a special on Gilbert O'Sullivan. When the first dedicated pop station, RTÉ Radio Two (now branded 2FM), was started in 1979, he was one of its best-known DJs. While in Dublin he shared accommodation with Charles Self. In 1981, he moved to London to work for Capital Radio. In 1984, he declined a lucrative offer to remain there and moved to New York City. Hanley founded Green Apple Productions in 1983 with Conor McAnally, an RTÉ television producer and son of actor Ray McAnally. The company produced MT-USA (Music Television USA), a three-hour-long music video show modelled on the new American cable channel, MTV. MT-USA was broadcast on RTÉ from 1984–87 on Sunday afternoons. Each block of videos was followed by a segment filmed in New York City with Hanley introducing the videos, discussing American music and culture, and interviewing a celebrity. RTÉ described him as Europe's first VJ (video jockey). In 1987, Hanley died shortly after his 33rd birthday. He had been visibly ill for some time, and was rumoured to have an AIDS-related illness, which he denied. This reflected the stigma then associated with the disease and with homosexuality in Ireland, which was not decriminalised until 1993. The illness admitted by Hanley was congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis, described as an \\"eye disorder\\"; he was blind in one eye by his death. Toxoplasmosis is very rarely fatal in adults who do not have a weakened immune system. In 2000, Hanley's friend and colleague Bill Hughes, who had himself come out in the 1990s, agreed that Hanley had in fact died of an AIDS-related illness. The same year, the Sunday Tribune newspaper placed Hanley at the top of a list of Irish gay icons. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:1987 deaths Category:AIDS-related deaths in the Republic of Ireland Category:Irish DJs Category:LGBT broadcasters Category:LGBT DJs Category:LGBT musicians from Ireland Category:People from Clonmel Category:RTÉ 2fm presenters Category:RTÉ television presenters Category:Gay musicians Category:Electronic dance music DJs ","title":"Vincent Hanley"},{"id":"1439685","text":"The Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, also known as the Winter Battle of the Masurian Lakes, was the northern part of the Central Powers' offensive on the Eastern Front in the winter of 1915. The offensive was intended to advance beyond the Vistula River and perhaps knock Russia out of the war. == Background == The Central Powers planned four offensives on their Eastern Front in early 1915. The Germans, led by Paul von Hindenburg, would attack eastward from their front line in western Poland, which had been occupied after the Battle of Łódź in 1914, toward the Vistula River and also in East Prussia in the vicinity of the Masurian Lakes (site of the 1914 Battle of the Masurian Lakes). The Austro-Hungarians would emerge from the Carpathian Mountain passes to attack the Russians by driving toward Lemberg. They would be led by General Alexander von Linsingen. Further south General Borojevic von Bojna would attempt to relieve the besieged fortress at Przemysl. ==Battle== German Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn strongly believed that the war would be won on the Western Front. Nonetheless, he sent four additional army corps to Paul von Hindenburg, commander of their Eastern Front. By February 1915, thirty-six percent of the German field army was in the east. German Ninth Army attacked from Silesia into Poland at the end of January; they released tear gas, which stopped their assault by blowing back on the attackers. The Russians counterattacked with eleven divisions under a single corps commander, losing 40,000 men in three days. In East Prussia, further Russian incursions were blocked by trench lines extending between the Masurian Lakes; they were held by the German Eighth Army, commanded by General Otto von Below. The Eighth Army was reinforced by some of the newly arrived corps, while the rest of them became the German Tenth Army, commanded by Colonel- General Hermann von Eichhorn, which was formed on the German left. The Tenth Army was to be one wing of a pincers intended to surround their opponents: General Sievers' Russian Tenth Army. A new Russian Twelfth Army under General Pavel Plehve was assembling in Poland roughly to the southwest.Stone 1998, pp. 116-119 Sievers warned the Northwest Front commander, General Nikolai Ruzsky, that they were likely to be attacked, but was ignored. On February 7, despite a heavy snowstorm, the left wing of Below's Eighth Army launched a surprise attack against Sievers, whose trenches were shallow, disconnected ditches, with little or no barbed wire because the first shipments had not arrived until December 1914. The following day, the German Tenth Army also drove forward. Snow, with drifts as high as a man, slowed German progress down the roads for the first two days; off the roads, the ground was too boggy for fighting. Despite these formidable obstacles, the German pincers advanced in a week, inflicting severe casualties on the Russians. As the Russians withdrew, the center of the German Eight Army began to thrust forward. The Russian withdrawal was disorderly; many prisoners were taken. Russian counterattacks on the lengthening flank of the German Tenth Army were beaten back. German men and horses fed on captured provisions, so only ammunition had to be hauled up to them. The snow was then washed away by torrential rain. The climax of the battle was on February 18, when the Russian 20th Army Corps, under General Bulgakov, was surrounded by the German Tenth Army in the vast Augustow Forest. On February 21, the survivors from the corps surrendered. The heroic stand of the Russian 20th Corps provided the time required for the rest of the Russian Tenth Army to form a new defensive position. On February 22, the day after the surrender of the 20th Corps, Plehve's Russian Twelfth Army counterattacked, which checked further German advances and brought the battle to an end. One source gives Russian losses as 92,000 prisoners and 300 guns, while another gives 56,000 men and 185 guns.Stone 1998, p. 118. The Germans lost 7,500 men and 14 guns. The Germans besieged the Russian fortress at Osowiec, but were unable to take it.Stone 1998, p.118 == Outcome == The Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes gave the Germans a toehold in Russia; however, the Russians blocked further advances. In the following weeks, the Germans drove the Russians out of their remaining small enclaves in East Prussia.Hindenburg, 1921, p.159 Further south, Alexander von Linsingen's offensive had failed with severe losses, and the fortress at Przemysl had been forced to surrender to the Russians. Clearly, the first Austro-Hungarian offensives of 1915 were abject failures. Henceforth, the Austro-Hungarians and Germans would work together more closely (see the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive). == See also == * First Battle of the Masurian Lakes == References == == Sources == *Tucker, Spencer C.

As a , right guard, Kramer was an integral part of the famous Packers sweep, a signature play in which both guards rapidly pull out from their normal positions and lead block for the running back going around the end. Kramer was an All-Pro five times, and a member of the National Football League 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in . Before his election into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018 at age 82, Kramer was noted for being a finalist for the Hall ten times without being voted in. In 2008, he was rated No. 1 in NFL Network's Top 10 list of players not in the Hall. Kramer was inducted into the Hall of Fame on August 4, 2018. At his induction speech, he quoted something his high school coach had often told him: \\"You can if you will\\".https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/8/4/17634798/nfl-hall-of- fame-2018-time-tv-schedule-inductees-ceremony-live-stream- resultshttps://www.krem.com/article/sports/after-50-years-of-waiting-jerry- kramer-becomes-18th-offensive-guard-to-enter-the-hall-of-fame/293-580152060 ==Early years== Born in eastern Montana in Jordan, Kramer moved with his parents and five siblings from northern Utah to northern Idaho when he was in the fourth grade, settling in Sandpoint. After graduating from Sandpoint High School in 1954, he accepted a football scholarship to the University of Idaho in Moscow to play for new head coach Skip Stahley. In that era, Idaho was a member of the Pacific Coast Conference, the forerunner of the Pac-12. Kramer was a standout two-way player for the Vandals, along with teammate (and road roommate) Wayne Walker of Boise, a future All-Pro linebacker with the Detroit Lions. Following the 1957 season, both played on the winning side in the East- West Shrine Game in late December in San Francisco, and at the College All- Star Game in Chicago in mid-August, in which they defeated the defending NFL champion Lions. Kramer was also a starter for the winning North team in the Senior Bowl in January in Mobile, Alabama. Kramer's number 64 was retired by the university in 1963, on his 27th birthday. (He wore #74 as a sophomore tackle in 1955, and #57 on the freshman team in 1954.) While at UI, Kramer joined Sigma Nu fraternity, and also lettered in track and field (discus and shot put). ==NFL career== Kramer was the 39th selection of the 1958 NFL Draft, taken in the fourth round by the Green Bay Packers. Two other hall of famers for the Packers were taken in this draft: fullback Jim Taylor of LSU in the second round (15th overall), and linebacker Ray Nitschke of Illinois in the third round (36th overall). Kramer played every game in his rookie season of 1958 under first-year head coach Ray \\"Scooter\\" McLean, but the Packers finished with the worst record (1–10–1) in the twelve-team league. In January 1959, the Packers hired a new head coach, Vince Lombardi, the offensive coach of the New York Giants. With Kramer playing right guard, the Packers won five NFL titles and the first two Super Bowls. He was also the team's placekicker in 1962, 1963, and part of 1968. As a kicker, he made 29 field goals, 90 extra points, for a total of 177 points. He also scored ten points, on three field goals and an extra point, in the Packers 16−7 victory over the New York Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game at frigid Yankee Stadium. In 1963, he was jovially described as \\"the best knuckleball kicker in the NFL.\\" In college at Idaho, he was also a kicker, with Walker as his long snapper; Walker was also a part-time kicker in the NFL for Detroit. During his NFL career, Kramer was often injured: among these were surgery to remove sizable wood fragments embedded in his abdomen from a teenage accident over a decade earlier, and a badly injured ankle suffered in 1961. In all, Kramer played in 129 regular season games; he also had 22 surgeries in 11 seasons, including a colostomy, which he described as \\"a horror movie that hasn't been made yet.\\" Despite these setbacks, Kramer was selected as an All-Pro five times (, , , , and ); he was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. Kramer is a member of the NFL's 50th Anniversary All-Time team, and was the final member of the team to be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association's inaugural HOVG class On August 24, 2017, Kramer and Houston Oilers linebacker Robert Brazile were named as Seniors Committee finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for 2018. On February 3, 2018 both were selected for induction into the Hall of Fame as part of its 2018 class, with induction occurring on Saturday, August 4. Kramer also did some broadcasting as color commentary for the NFL on NBC - Week 2 , with Chuck Thompson on the play-by-play, Miami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills , on September 11, 1988. ==Work as author== In his penultimate season of 1967, Kramer collaborated with Dick Schaap on his first book, the best-selling Instant Replay, a diary of the season which chronicled the life of a professional football offensive lineman. The book climaxed with Kramer's lead block in front of Bart Starr to win the \\"Ice Bowl\\" championship game. Kramer and Schaap wrote two more books together. Kramer played one more year, under new head coach Phil Bengtson in 1968. Following that season, in which the aging Packers fell to a record of 6–7–1 and missed the playoffs, he wrote a second book, Farewell to Football. After retiring as a player in May 1969, Kramer briefly worked as a color commentator on CBS' NFL telecasts. Following Lombardi's death from cancer in , Kramer edited Lombardi: Winning Is the Only Thing, a collection of reminiscences from coaches, players, friends and family of Lombardi whom Kramer interviewed for the book. In 1985, Kramer wrote Distant Replay, which updated the whereabouts of the members of the Packers' Super Bowl I championship team following a team reunion at Lambeau Field during the 1984 season. In October 2005, he released Inside the Locker Room, a CD set that includes Lombardi's final locker room address as the head coach of the Packers in January 1968, immediately after Super Bowl II. In September 2006, Kramer re-released his 1968 best seller, Instant Replay. ==Health issues== Kramer was noteworthy for overcoming a series of accidents and health issues prior to and during his professional football career. The most serious was in 1964; he played the first two games then missed the rest of the season, later diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic with actinomycosis. After his wood fragment removal surgery in May 1965, he reclaimed his starting position at right guard and the Packers won three straight NFL titles (and the first two Super Bowls) and he was a first-team All-Pro twice more. The original accident in the summer of 1953 occurred when Kramer was chasing a calf on his family's farm and the calf stepped on board, shattering it and shooting lance-shaped splinter of wood into Kramer's abdomen; after piercing his abdomen, the splinter partially exited Kramer's back between two vertebrae. Doctors cut the piece in two and pulled it out front and back; two weeks later, Kramer was at pre-season football practice at Sandpoint High School for his senior season. As a freshman, he backed into a lathe in shop class and incurred muscle damage to a hip, and was later in a car accident. While hunting, Kramer's shotgun exploded, which significantly injured his right forearm. He suffered broken bones, torn muscles, and nerve damage, which required plastic surgery and skin grafts. Some of the lead shot also penetrated his liver. To this day, Kramer cannot use the little finger on his right hand. In college at Idaho, Kramer was on the field for nearly every play until the final game when he incurred a minor knee injury. He played in two All-Star games shortly after. ==Personal life== After retirement from the NFL, Kramer lived on a ranch near Parma in southwestern Idaho with his second wife Wink, then later moved to Boise.Idaho Press-Tribune - Kramer remembers gridiron life - Football great enjoys exciting year, strives to make living better for others – April 2, 2011 Twice divorced, Kramer has six children: Tony, Diane, Daniel, Alicia, Matthew, and Jordan. He has five grandchildren. His youngest sons, Matt and Jordan Kramer, also played college football at the University of Idaho. Jordan, named after the Montana town in which Kramer was born, played two seasons in the NFL as a linebacker with the Tennessee Titans in 2003 and 2004. After turning eighty in early 2016, Kramer auctioned off several items of memorabilia to raise college funds for his grandchildren, including his ring from the first Super Bowl, which was sold for $125,000. ==ReferencesCategory:1936 births Category:Living people Category:People from Parma, Idaho Category:People from Sandpoint, Idaho Category:People from Jordan, Montana Category:Sportspeople from Boise, Idaho Category:Players of American football from Idaho Category:Players of American football from Montana Category:American football offensive guards Category:American football placekickers Category:Idaho Vandals football players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Western Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:National Football League announcers ","title":"Jerry Kramer"},{"id":"1439747","text":"Sharon Olds (born November 19, 1942) is an American poet. Olds has won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry, the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award, and the first San Francisco Poetry Center Award in 1980.San Francisco Poetry Center AwardSharon Olds : The Poetry Foundation She teaches creative writing at New York University.Sharon Olds, Faculty of CWP  NYU ==Early life== Sharon Olds was born on November 19, 1942, in San Francisco, California,Academy of American Poets but was brought up in Berkeley, California, along with her siblings. She was raised as a \\"hellfire Calvinist\\", as she describes it.Olds' Biog at Poetry Foundation Her father, like his before him, was an alcoholic who was often abusive to his children. In Olds' writing she often refers to the time (or possibly even times) when her father tied her to a chair.The Barclay Agency Olds' mother was often either unable or too afraid to come to the aid of her children. The strict religious environment in which Olds was raised had certain rules of censorship and restriction. Olds was not permitted to go to the movies and the family did not own a television. Olds once said she won a singing contest in church choir. \\"[The prize] was a book of child martyrs who had been killed for their belief and died very politely.\\" She liked fairy tales, and also read Nancy Drew and Life magazine. As for her own religious views and her exposure to religious literary art she says she was by nature \\"a pagan and a pantheist\\" and notes: \\"I was in a church where there was both great literary art and bad literary art, the great art being psalms and the bad art being hymns. The four-beat was something that was just part of my consciousness from before I was born.\\" She adds: \\"I think I was about 15 when I conceived of myself as an atheist, but I think it was only very recently that I can really tell that there's nobody there with a copybook making marks against your name.\\" Olds was sent east to Dana Hall School, an all-girls school for grades 6 to 12 in Wellesley, Massachusetts that boasts an impressive list of alumnae.Dana Hall School: Sharon Olds 1960 There she studied mostly English, History, and Creative Writing. Her favorite poets included William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, but it was Allen Ginsberg's Howl and Other Poems that she carried in her purse through tenth grade. For her bachelor's degree Olds returned to California where she earned her BA at Stanford University in 1964. Following this Olds once again moved cross country to New York, where she earned her Ph.D. in English in 1972 from Columbia University. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on \\"Emerson's Prosody\\", because she appreciated the way he defied convention. ==Personal life== On March 23, 1968, she married Dr. David Douglas Olds in New York City and, in 1969, gave birth to the first of their two children. In 1997, after 29 years of marriage, they divorced, and Olds moved to New Hampshire, though she commutes to New York three days a week. There, she lives in the same Upper West Side apartment she has lived in for the past 40 years while working as a Professor at New York University. In New Hampshire she lives in Graylag Cabins in Pittsfield, with her partner of seven years, Carl Wallman, a former cattle breeder. In 2005, First Lady Laura Bush invited Olds to the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. Olds responded, declining the invitation in an open letter published in the October 10, 2005 issue of The Nation. The letter closes: > \\"So many Americans who had felt pride in our country now feel anguish and > shame for the current regime of blood, wounds and fire. I thought of the > clean linens at your table, the shining knives and the flames of the > candles, and I could not stomach it\\". ==Poetry== Following her PhD, Olds let go of an attachment to what she thought she 'knew about' poetic convention and began to write about her family, abuse, sex, focusing on the work not the audience. Olds has commented that she is more informed by the work of poets such as Galway Kinnell, Muriel Rukeyser and Gwendolyn Brooks than by confessional poets like Anne Sexton or Sylvia Plath. Plath, she comments \\"was a great genius, with an IQ of at least double mine\\" and while these women charted well the way of women in the world she says \\"their steps were not steps I wanted to put my feet in.\\" When Olds first sent her poetry to a literary magazine she received a reply saying,\\"This is a literary magazine. If you wish to write about this sort of subject, may we suggest the Ladies' Home Journal. The true subjects of poetry are... male subjects, not your children.\\" Olds eventually published her first collection, Satan Says, in 1980, at the age of 37. Satan Says sets up the sexual and bodily candour that would run through much of her work. In \\"The Sisters of Sexual Treasure\\" she writes, As soon as my sister and I got out of our mother's house, all we wanted to do was fuck, obliterate her tiny sparrow body and narrow grasshopper legs. The collection is divided into four sections: \\"Daughter\\", \\"Woman\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"Journeys\\". These titles echo the familial influence that is prevalent in much of Olds' work. The Dead and the Living was published in February 1984. This collection is divided into two sections, \\"Poems for the Dead\\" and \\"Poems for the Living\\". The first section begins with poems about global injustices. These injustices include the Turkish Massacre of the Armenians during WWI, the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, and even the death of Marilyn Monroe. Olds' book The Wellspring (1996), shares with her previous work the use of raw language and startling images to convey truths about domestic and political violence and family relationships. A reviewer for The New York Times hailed her poetry for its vision: \\"Like Whitman, Ms. Olds sings the body in celebration of a power stronger than political oppression.\\" Alicia Ostriker noted Olds traces the \\"erotics of family love and pain.\\" Ostriker continues: \\"In later collections, [Olds] writes of an abusive childhood, in which miserably married parents bully and punish and silence her. She writes, too, of her mother's apology \\"after 37 years\\", a moment when \\"The sky seemed to be splintering, like a window/ someone is bursting into or out of\\" Olds' work is anthologized in over 100 collections, ranging from literary/poetry textbooks to special collections. Her poetry has been translated into seven languages for international publications. She has been published in Beloit Poetry Journal. She was the New York State Poet Laureate for 1998–2000.Sharon Olds Stag's Leap was published in 2013. The poems were written in 1997, following the divorce from her husband of 29 years. The poems focus on her husband, and even sometimes his mistress. The collection won the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry. She is the first American woman to win this award. It also won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. ==Women's Movement== Olds did not participate in the Women's Movement at first, but she says, \\"My first child was born in 1969. In 1968 the Women's Movement in New York City—especially among a lot of women I knew—was very alive. I had these strong ambitions to enter the bourgeoisie if I could. I wasn't a radical at all. But I do remember understanding that I had never questioned that men had all the important jobs. And that was shocking—well, I was twenty years old! I'd never thought, \\"Oh, where's the woman bus driver?\\" So there's another subject—which was what it felt like to be a woman in the world.\\"Advice to Young Poets: Sharon Olds in Conversation ==Honors and awards== * 1978 Creative Artists Public Service GrantOLDS, Sharon * 1978 Madeline Sadin Award, New York QuarterlyIssue 22 * 1979 Younger Poets Award, Poetry Miscellany * 1980 Satan Says inaugural San Francisco Poetry Center Award. * 1981–1982 Guggenheim Fellowship, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial FoundationSharon Olds Guggenheim Fellowship Member Page * 1982–1983 National Endowment for the Arts FellowshipCreative Writing Fellowship Winners and National Awards * 1983 The Dead and the Living Lamont Poetry Prize, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. * 1992 The Father, shortlisted for the T.
