It is the largest company in Australia by revenue and the second-largest in New Zealand. In addition, Woolworths Group is the largest takeaway liquor-retailer in Australia, the largest hotel and gaming poker-machine operator in Australia, and was the 19th-largest retailer in the world in 2008. Despite similar names, Woolworths Group has no affiliation with the F.W. Woolworth Company based in the United States, the now-defunct Woolworths Group in the UK or the South African chain of retail stores, Woolworths Holdings Limited. Its main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and the Countdown brand in New Zealand), liquor retailing (as BWS and Dan Murphy's in Australia), hotels and pubs under the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH Group) umbrella, and discount department-stores under the Big W name in Australia. On 25 August 2016, the company announced a loss of $1.235 billion for the 2016 financial year, the biggest loss in the more than 20 years since it has been publicly listed on the ASX, mainly due to more than $2 billion in write-downs of the failed Masters business and losses in the Big W business. ==History== Woolworths flagship store in the Sydney CBD Woolworths opened its first store, the Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement, in the old Imperial Arcade Pitt Street, Sydney, where Westfield Sydney now stands, on 5 December 1924. Its nominal capital was just £185,000, and although 85,000 shares were offered to the public, only 81,707 shares were subscribed for by 619 people, including the five founders – Percy Christmas, Stanley Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George Creed and Ernest Williams. One of the foundation investors was Preston Lanchester Gowing, the then chairman of Gowings. The name on the draft prospectus drawn up by Cecil Scott Waine was \\"Wallworths Bazaar\\" – a play on the name of F.W. Woolworth, the owner of the Woolworth's chain in the United States and United Kingdom. Moreover, according to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead, which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was available for use in New South Wales. Accordingly, Woolworths Ltd in Australia has no connection with the F.W. Woolworth Company in the United States, nor the Woolworths Group of UK. It also has no connection to the Woolworths Group in South Africa. The new Woolworths store was the first variety store in the world to use cash registers that print receipts for customers. Christmas set up a New Zealand general merchandise operation in Wellington in 1929. Woolworths New Zealand opened its first food store in Auckland in 1956, and supermarkets in 1971. Woolworths New Zealand was sold to the company that is now Lion Nathan in 1979, then sold to Dairy Farm International in 1990, now owned by Progressive Enterprises, a subsidiary of Foodland Associated Limited of Australia. In 2005 Woolworths Limited and Metcash Holdings agreed to purchase a demerged Foodland, and Progressive Enterprises and 23 of Foodland's Action supermarkets came under Woolworths' ownership. This acquisition brought total store numbers in Australia to near 750. During the late 1920s, the company grew, with a second store in Sydney and stores in Brisbane and Perth. It grew further in the 1930s, despite the depression, until by the end of 1933 it had 23 stores. In 1933 the first store in Melbourne was opened. On 1 April 1936 the company bought eight stores from Edments Ltd and opened its first store in Adelaide. The original Imperial Arcade store was moved to larger premises in Her Majesty's Arcade, a short distance along Pitt Street near the Market Street corner. World War II slowed the growth of Woolworths and the Australian and United States military used Woolworths' warehouses in Sydney for storage. After the war expansion was rapid and in 1955 Woolworths opened its 200th store, in the Civic Centre in Canberra (since closed). At this point Woolworths was still mainly a variety chain and had not moved into the food sector that uses the \\"Woolworths\\" brand today. This move began in 1955 when it opened its first supermarket at Beverly Hills, south-west of Sydney. The company bought the Rockmans chain of women's clothing stores in 1960. In the 1970s, the company started to open Big W discount department stores and the slow removal of many variety products from the supermarket and variety stores began. This process finished in 1989 when the last of the Woolworths Variety stores was closed (except the one in Rundle Mall) and the \\"Family Centres\\" were split into separate Big W and Woolworths supermarket stores. Woolworths acquired the Dick Smith Electronics consumer electronics chain in 1981 and expanded the consumer electronics arm of its business with the purchase of the Tandy chain in Australia from InterTan Inc in 2001. The company sold the Rockmans chain in 2000, and the Dick Smith Electronics chain in 2012. === 1980s === In 1985, the acquisition of the 126 Safeway stores in eastern Australia made Woolworths the largest food retailer in Australia. Safeway stores were in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and included Food Barns in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The stores were acquired following an agreement whereby Safeway acquired a 20% interest in Woolworths Limited. Woolworths and Safeway supermarkets in Victoria traded under the Safeway brand, and Safeway's Food Barns in Queensland and New South Wales became part of Woolworths. Around this time, the supermarket chain had run eight small supermarket chains including the Queensland-based Food For Less and the Sydney-based Flemings, both of which survive. In 1989, Woolworths was acquired by Industrial Equity Limited, which was in turn one-third owned by the Adelaide Steamship Company, David Jones Limited and Tooth & Co. It was a wholly owned subsidiary until 1993, when it was floated in the biggest share sale (at that time) in Australia's history. === 1990s === In 1996, Woolworths entered the petrol market, initially with wholly owned \\"Plus Petrol\\" outlets located in shopping centre parking lots. In 2003, as part of a loyalty program aimed at attracting customers to supermarkets through the lure of four-cent a litre discounts, Woolworths entered into an agreement with Caltex to co-brand some Caltex outlets as Caltex Woolworths. These joint venture outlets are supplied with fuel by Caltex and with groceries by Woolworths, and accept Woolworths cards and discount dockets. In 1999, Woolworths began a joint venture with the Commonwealth Bank called Woolworths Ezy Banking, but was scaled back by 2006. In 2005, the company reached an agreement with the ANZ Banking Group to install ATMs at Woolworths, Big W and Caltex Woolworths locations. Additionally, by 2008, it had invested in financial services infrastructure and expertise, building a team of 50 staff for this purpose. In 1997, Woolworths opened its first Metro convenience store, in Sydney, converting their premier multi-level variety store for 32 years to this format with the lower ground floor specialising in a large range of 'prepared meals' to cater for the increasing numbers of city dwellers. Known for its rainbow branding with the slogan \\"Fine food without the fuss\\", subsequent stores were opened in Coogee, Boronia Park, West Pennant Hills, Newtown, Waterloo and its flagship Town Hall store in Sydney and Ascot in Brisbane. Currently the \\"Woolworths Metro\\" brand is used for smaller format convenience stores in the major cities and towns across Australia. Woolworths expanded into liquor businesses with the acquisition of Dan Murphy's in 1998. === 2000s === By 2001, the BWS chain had been established. With Queensland licensing laws dictating that retail outlets must be operated by a hotelier, Woolworths moved into the hotel industry in 2005 in a joint venture with experienced hotel operator Bruce Mathieson, purchasing hotelier Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group (ALH). Later in 2005 the ALH Group expanded its portfolio to 250 hotels by acquiring the Taverner Hotel Group and the Bruce Mathieson Group. The ALH Group is 25% owned by Bruce Mathieson and 75% owned by Woolworths. Statistics provided during the acquisition of the Taverner group showed that over one third of sales are made up of gaming/poker machine takings.Woolworths Limited taverners analyst presentation The number of poker machines owned by Woolworths and Bruce Mathieson after ALH acquisitions was 10,722.\\"Retail Giants Place Side Bet on Pokies\\", theage.com.au, 28 March 2006. In June 2006, the company opened a buying office in Hong Kong to cut out the intermediary in sourcing foreign-produced items. In September 2006, Woolworths announced that it had taken a 10% strategic stake in The Warehouse Group in New Zealand. Also in 2006, it announced a venture with the Tata Group in India to introduce Dick Smiths Electronics stores to that country. In 2006, Woolworths rolled out new Retalix point of sale systems running on IBM POS hardware with LCD touchscreens throughout all its stores. These self-serve checkouts were initially trialled in Carlingford, NSW. In August 2007, Woolworths announced that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008. It is expected to offer credit cardholders reward vouchers redeemable through its store network. HSBC was subsequently named as its credit card partner. Woolworths subsequently announced that the Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard would be launched on 26 August 2008 and allows customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths group retailers. It was suggested Woolworths could earn approximately $20m from credit cards in three years and that it was targeting 100,000 to 150,000 cardholders in the first year. Into 2008, a Wake Up Woolworths campaign, largely funded by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, was pushing Woolworths to sever its relationship with Asia Pulp & Paper over claims of deforestation of Indonesian rainforests. Asia Pulp & Paper supplies Woolworths' Select Brand tissue products. During 2009, Woolworths Ltd. and Lowes purchased Danks Ltd. owners of the Home Timber and Hardware brand. They entered joint venture with Lowes, one of North America's largest home improvement chains, to launch a new hardware brand named Masters Home Improvement. The first of these stores was opened to the public in Braybrook, Melbourne, Victoria, on 1 September 2011.http://miy.masters.com.au/about/media/first-masters-store-opens-today-in- braybrook-melbourne Aiming to open 150 stores within the next five years, as of June 2014 there were 49 stores operational with more being constructed and/or planned. The business was not profitable, and in 2015 Masters lost . On 18 January 2016 Woolworths announced that it intended to \\"either sell or wind up\\" Masters hardware and Home Timber and Hardware. Chairman Gordon Cairns said that it would take years to become profitable and that the ongoing losses could not be sustained. On 24 August 2016 it was announced that all Masters stores would close on or before 11 December 2016. It was also announced that Woolworths would sell the Home Timber and Hardware brand to Metcash. == Other ventures == The Australian Leisure & Hospitality Group, 75% owned by Woolworths, operates over 12,650 poker machines across Australia, making it the largest operator of pokies in Australia. The poker machines are estimated to raise $1.2 billion in net revenue each year. Michael Luscombe in 2010 told shareholders he has no intention of leaving the poker machines business, and the company has lobbied against mandatory precommitment technology. When mandatory pre-commitment was implemented, the Woolworths owned hotels created a loyalty card scheme to offer incentives to frequent gamblers, giving them free food and drink. In July 2019, Woolworths announced plans to sell its gambling and liquor interests. It said ALH and Endeavour Drinks would potentially be spun-off into a separate company and launched on the stockmarket in 2020, but Woolworths shareholders would first need to approve the plan at an annual general meeting. ===Shopping Centres Australasia Property Group=== In 2012, Woolworths Limited placed 69 shopping centres it owned into a real estate investment trust known as Shopping Centres Australasia Property Group (or SCA Property Group), which listed as a separate entity on the ASX on 26 November 2012. Most of the locations contain a Woolworths Limited owned store as an anchor tenant. The trust derives most of its rental income from Woolworths Limited stores. ===Cartology=== In 2019, Woolworths Group launched a stand-alone media business called Cartology to communicate with supplier partners and customers. The company will be managed by Mike Tyquin who has worked in media for over 25 years. ==See also== * List of Woolworths Limited companies ==References== ==External links== *Woolworths Group *Woolworths Limited *Woolworths supermarkets Category:Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange Category:Conglomerate companies of Australia Category:Companies based in New South Wales Category:Conglomerate companies established in 1924 Category:Retail companies established in 1924 Category:Australian brands Category:Online retailers of Australia Category:Gambling companies of Australia Category:The Hills Shire ","title":"Woolworths Group (Australia)"},{"id":"514890","text":" USS Edsall (DD-219), named for Seaman Norman Eckley Edsall (1873-1899), was a of the United States Navy. She was sunk 1 March 1942. ==Construction and commissioning== Edsall was laid down by the William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company on 15 September 1919, launched on 29 July 1920 by Mrs. Bessie Edsall Bracey, sister of Seaman Edsall and commissioned on 26 November 1920, Commander A. H. Rice in command. ==Service history== Edsall sailed from Philadelphia on 6 December 1920 for San Diego, California on shakedown. She arrived at San Diego 11 January 1921, and remained on the United States West Coast until December, engaging in battle practice and gunnery drills with fleet units. Returning to Charleston, South Carolina, 28 December, Edsall was ordered to the Mediterranean and departed 26 May 1922. Arriving at Constantinople on 28 June, Edsall joined the U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters to protect American lives and interests. The Near East was in turmoil with civil strife in Russia and Greece at war with Turkey. She did much for international relations by helping alleviate postwar famine in eastern Europe, transporting American commercial operatives, evacuating refugees, furnishing a center of communications for the Near East, and standing by for emergencies. When the Turks expelled the Anatolian Greeks from Smyrna (Izmir), Edsall was one of the American destroyers which evacuated thousands. On 14 September 1922, she took 607 refugeesDD-219's Log states 664 persons were evacuated off in Smyrna and transported them to Salonika, returning to Smyrna 16 September to act as flagship for the naval forces there. In October she carried refugees from Smyrna to Mytilene on Lesbos Island. She made repeated visits to ports in Turkey, Bulgaria, Russia, Greece, Egypt, Mandate Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, Dalmatia, and Italy, and kept up gunnery and torpedo practice with her sisters until her return to Boston, Massachusetts, for overhaul 26 July 1924. Edsall sailed to join the U.S. Asiatic Fleet on 3 January 1925, joining in battle practice and maneuvers at Guantanamo Bay, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor before arriving at Shanghai on 22 June. She was to become a fixture of the Asiatic Fleet on the China coast, in the Philippines and Japan. Her primary duty was protection of American interests in the Far East. She served during the civil war in China, and the early part of the Sino-Japanese War. Battle practice, maneuvers and diplomacy took her most frequently to Shanghai, Chefoo, Hankow, Hong Kong, Nanking, Kobe, Bangkok, and Manila. In late October 1927, for example, Edsall visited the Siamese capital at Bangkok, and had three of the Royal Princesses aboard for tea. In return Edsalls skipper, Commander Jules James, was given an engraved silver cigarette case by the Royal Family. ===World War II=== On 25 November 1941, two days in advance of the \\"war warning\\" which predicted that hostile Japanese action in the Pacific was imminent, Admiral Hart, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, dispatched Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 57 (, , and Edsall) with the destroyer tender , to Balikpapan, Borneo, to disperse the surface ships of his fleet from their vulnerable position in Manila Bay. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (local date 8 December 1941 due to the International Date Line), Edsall was en route to Batavia (Jakarta) with her sister ships when word of the start of hostilities was received. DesDiv 57 was ordered to Singapore to rendezvous with the Royal Navy Force Z. She embarked a British liaison officer and four men at Singapore from and was sent to search for survivors of and , sunk by Japanese aircraft off the east coast of Malaya on 10 December. Edsall intercepted a Japanese fishing trawler, Kofuku Maru (later renamed and used extensively by Australian special forces) with four small boats in tow and escorted them into Singapore before turning them over to . Edsall and her division mates then joined the heavy cruiser and other US units at Surabaya on 15 December 1941, then escorted shipping retiring to the relative safety of Darwin, Australia. During the first week of 1942 Edsall escorted the so-called Pensacola Convoy from Torres Strait back to Darwin. After fueling operations in the Lesser Sunda Islands, Edsall and Alden were escorting the Darwin-bound oiler in the Beagle Gulf west of Darwin, Australia, on the morning of 20 January 1942, when the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine sighted Trinity. Misidentifying Trinity as a transport, I-123 fired four Type 89 torpedoes at Trinity at shortly after 0630. The sound man aboard I-123 reported hearing one torpedo hit Trinity, but in fact all four torpedoes missed, although Trinity sighted three of them and reported the attack. Alden then searched for I-123, made sound contact, and conducted a brief depth charge attack at 06:41 before losing contact on I-123 and abandoning the search. I-123 escaped unscathed. Later that day, Edsall became the first U.S. destroyer to participate in the sinking of a full-sized enemy submarine in World War II. With three Australian corvettes — (, , and ) — Edsall helped sink the off Darwin. Contrary to rumor, this sunken submarine was never entered, nor were classified documents ever recovered from it. Continuing to escort convoys in northern Australian waters, Edsall was damaged when one of her own depth charges exploded prematurely during an anti-submarine attack on 23 January 1942 in the shallow — — Howard Channel. On 3 February Edsall and other American units of ABDA moved up to Tjilatjap, Java in order to be closer to the combat theater and also to fuel stocks. She continued in her service as a patrol vessel off southern Java. On 23 February 1942 she and the old gunboat operated off Tjilatjap on antisubmarine patrols. USAT Willard A. Holbrook off Java, 15 February 1942 On 26 February she steamed from Tjilatjap with her sister ship to rendezvous with the converted seaplane tender , which was bringing in P-40E fighters and U.S. Army Air Force personnel for the defense of Java. On 27 February, the three ships were attacked by sixteen (16) Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's Takao Kōkūtai, led by Lieutenant Jiro Adachi, flying out of Den Pasar airfield on Bali, and escorted by fifteen (15) Mitsubishi A6M Reisen (Zero) fighters. The attack damaged Langley so severely that she had to be scuttled. Edsall picked up 177 survivors; Whipple, 308. On 28 February the two destroyers rendezvoused with the oiler off Flying Fish Cove, Christmas Island some southwest of Tjilatjap. More Japanese bombers forced Edsall and the other ships to head for open sea. They headed directly south into the Indian Ocean for the rest of 28 February in high winds and heavy seas; in the early pre- dawn hours of 1 March all Langley crew were transferred to Pecos. This was completed between 0430 (USN/local time) and 0815 on 1 March. Whipple then set off for Cocos as protection for the tanker Belita sent to meet her there; Pecos, carrying about 700 survivors from Langley, and Houston, plus assorted stragglers, was ordered to Australia. Edsall was directed to return to Tjilatjap, carrying U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) pilots and ground crew who had been passengers on Langley. The USAAF personnel were to assemble and fly 27 disassembled and crated P-40 fighters which had been delivered to Tjilatjap aboard the cargo ship . Following orders, at 0830 she headed back to the northeast for Java, and was never seen again by Allied forces. ===Last engagement of Edsall=== Pecos was detected later that morning by air patrols from the carriers of Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's Kido Butai (or KdB) and came under heavy air attack. For some time she sent out distress calls to any Allied ships in the area, as it was assumed the ship would probably be lost. Whipple, less than distant, copied some of these calls, but was too far away to return quickly. , a troopship many hundreds of miles/kilometers away in the Indian Ocean also read some of the signals. At approximately 1548 hours Pecos sank after being attacked for several hours by four waves of IJN dive-bombers from Nagumo's KdB. At 1550 hours (USN/local time) a single \\"light cruiser\\" was spotted about behind the Japanese task force, approximately SSE of Christmas Island; this was in fact Edsall. The destroyer was perhaps no more than from the last reported position of Pecos and likely attempting to get to her stricken comrades. At about 1603 hours she was seen from the Japanese heavy cruiser and within another five minutes the cruiser opened fire with her guns. Fifteen minutes later the battleships of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa's Sentai 3/1 (Hiei and Kirishima) opened fire with their main battery of guns at extreme range (). All shots missed as the destroyer fled and conducted evasive maneuvers that ranged from flank speed – about for the hobbled ship – to full stop, with radical turns and intermittent smoke-screens. USS Edsall sinking Edsall also disrupted the Japanese with counter-attacks, firing her torpedoes – which narrowly missed Chikuma – and with 4-inch gunfire, even though outranged. Edsall signalled that she had been surprised by two enemy battleships; this was copied by the Dutch merchant ship Siantar more than away. The Japanese surface vessels (2 cruisers, 2 battleships) fired 1,335 shells at Edsall that afternoon with no more than one or two hits, which failed to stop the destroyer. Vice Admiral Nagumo ordered airstrikes: 26 Type 99 divebombers (Aichi D3A) (kanbaku) in three groups (chutai) took off from the carriers (8), (9), and (9). The dive bombers were led by Lieutenants Ogawa, Kobayashi, and Koite respectively. Their bombs immobilised Edsall. At 17:22 the Japanese ships resumed firing on the destroyer. A Japanese camera- man, probably on the cruiser , filmed about 90 seconds of her destruction. (A single frame from this film was culled for use as a propaganda photo later, misidentified as \\"the British destroyer HMS Pope\\".) Finally, at 17:31 hrs (19:01 IJN/Tokyo time) Edsall rolled onto her side, \\"showing her red bottom\\" according to an officer aboard the , and sank amid clouds of steam and smoke. Subsequent Japanese navy reports referred to the incident as \\"a fiasco\\". ===The fate of Edsall survivors=== Japanese Imperial Navy officers aboard the cruiser Chikuma many years later reported that a number of men may have survived the sinking of Edsall—they were found in the water on liferafts, cutters, clinging to debris, etc. However, due to a submarine alert, the nervous Japanese only stopped long enough to rescue a handful (the Japanese word is jakkan) before they received orders to steam off for home base, leaving the others to perish in the Indian Ocean. On board Chikuma the survivors were treated well, clothed & fed, and interrogated by their captors, giving the name of their ship as \\"the old destroyer E-do-soo-ru\\". After a few days the details of these interrogations were shared with the other ships of Nagumo's Kido Butai during their return journey. There is some suggestion that the cruiser Tone may have picked up a survivor or two as well, but there is no confirming evidence of this. The Americans were held on Chikuma for the next ten days before returning to the Japanese force's advance base on 11 March 1942. On 21 September 1946 several mass graves were opened in a remote locale in the East Indies, over from the point of Edsalls disappearance. In two graves, containing 34 decapitated bodies, were the remains of six Edsall crewmen and what are thought to be five more USAAF personnel from Langley, along with numerous Javanese, Chinese, and Dutch merchant sailors from the Dutch merchant-ship Modjokerto, sunk the same day as Edsall in the same area south of Christmas Island. The American bodies were reinterred in U.S. cemeteries between December 1949 and March 1950. War crimes trials conducted in 1946–1948 concerning other murders that occurred in or near Kendari by IJN personnel contain fragmentary information about the killings of Edsall survivors but were not recognized as such by Allied investigators, and were not pursued. ==Awards== Edsall received two battle stars for her World War II service. ==L. Ron Hubbard claim== L. Ron Hubbard claimed he served on Edsall during World War II. Following her sinking he swam to shore, and remained in the jungle as the ship's sole survivor. He claimed that this is where he was during the bombing of Pearl Harbor, despite the fact that Edsall was sunk in 1942, and the U.S. Navy has no record of his service on the ship. Navy records show that Hubbard was in training in New York when the war broke out. He was supposed to be posted to the Philippines, but his ship was diverted to Australia. There he angered the Naval Attache for assuming \\"unauthorized duties,\\" he was relieved from his assignment and returned to the United States.Lawrence Wright \\"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief,\\" ==References== * Primary source: Donald M.

Then reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, she transited the Panama Canal and arrived at San Francisco, California 5 August 1937. She operated continuously with the Pacific Fleet until the outbreak of World War II, homeported at San Diego, California. ===World War II=== On 5 December 1941, Porter got underway from Pearl Harbor, escaping the Japanese attack by two days. She patrolled with cruisers and destroyers in Hawaiian waters before steaming in convoy 25 March 1942 for the west coast. She operated off the west coast with Task Force 1 (TF 1) for the next 4 months. Returning to Pearl Harbor in mid-August, she trained in Hawaiian waters until 16 October when she sortied with TF 16 and headed for the Solomon Islands. Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands On 26 October 1942, TF 16 exchanged air attacks with strong Japanese forces northeast of Guadalcanal in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

It is a vigorous biennial plant with coarse, spiny leaves and conspicuous spiny- winged stems.Tutin, T. G. et al., eds. (1976). Flora Europaea vol. 4. Cambridge University Press ==Description== Detailed image It is a biennial plant, producing a large rosette of spiny leaves the first year. The plants typically germinate in the autumn after the first rains and exist as rosettes throughout the first year, forming a stout, fleshy taproot that may extend down 30 cm or more for a food reserve. In the second year, the plant can grow to as much as 3 m tall with a width of up to 1.5 m. The leaves are 10–50 cm wide, alternate, spiny, and often covered with white woolly hairs with the lower surface more densely covered than the upper. The leaves are deeply lobed with long, stiff spines along the margins. Fine hairs give the plant a greyish appearance. The massive main stem may be 10 cm wide at the base and branched in the upper part. Each stem has a vertical row of broad, spiny wings (conspicuous ribbon-like leafy material), typically 2–3 cm wide, extending to the base of the flower head. The flowers are globe shaped, 2–6 cm in diameter, from dark pink to lavender, and are produced in the summer. The flower buds form first at the tip of the stem and later at the tip of the axillary branches. They appear singly or in groups of two or three on branch tips. The plants are androgynous, with both pistil and stamens, and sit above numerous, long, stiff, spine-tipped bracts, all pointing outwards, the lower ones wider apart and pointing downwards. After flowering, the ovary starts swelling and forms about 8,400 to 40,000 seeds per plant.Flora of NW Europe: Cotton ThistleYoung, J.A. and R.A.

The plant prefers habitats with dry summers, such as the Mediterranean region, growing best in sandy clay and calcareous soils which are rich in ammonium salts. It grows in ruderal places, as well as dry pastures and disturbed fields. Its preferred habitats are natural areas, disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, and especially sites with fertile soils, agricultural areas, range/grasslands, riparian zones, scrub/shrublands valleys and plains along with water courses. Temperature and moisture, rather than soil nutrient concentrations, determine the ecological performance of Onopordum species. In Europe, the plant tends to colonise disturbed pastures. In its native range, cotton thistle is considered a weak competitor that needs regeneration gaps to develop and maintain stands; populations tend to retreat when disturbance ceases. The plant has been widely introduced at mid-latitudes across much of North America.Taylor, R.J. 1990. \\"Northwest Weeds: The Ugly and Beautiful Villains of Fields, Gardens, and Roadsides\\". Mountain Press Publishing, Missoula, Montana. Scotch thistle can spread rapidly. For example, it was first found in Utah in 1963. By 1981, it covered approximately 6070 hectares in 17 counties. Eight years later, it had spread to cover more than 22,540 hectares in 22 counties.Dewey, S.A. (1991). Weed thistles of the western United States. In: James, L.F., J.O. Evans, M.H. Ralphs, and R.D. Child, eds. Noxious Range Weeds. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado. pp. 247-253. ==Ecology== Onopordum acanthium reproduces only by seeds. Most seeds germinate in autumn after the first rains, but some seeds can germinate year round under favourable moisture and temperature conditions. Seeds that germinate in late autumn become biennials. But when they germinate earlier, they can behave as annuals. Buried seed can remain viable in the soil seed bank for at least seven years and possibly for up to twenty years or more. Yearly seed production and seed dormancy are highly variable depending on environmental conditions. The slender and smooth achenes are about 3 mm long and are brown with gray markings. They are tipped with a pappus of slender bristles. Mainly locally dispersed by wind, or more widely by humans, birds, wildlife, livestock or streams, the seeds are sensitive to light and only germinate when close to the surface. Seedlings will emerge from soil depths up to 4.5 cm, with 0.5 cm being optimal. While some seeds will germinate in the dark, studies indicate that most germination occurs with alternating light/dark cycles, with 8 hours being the optimal day length. The leaves of cotton thistle provide food for the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the thistle ermine (Myelois circumvoluta). ==Taxonomy and naming== Three subspecies are accepted: *Onopordum acanthium subsp. acanthium. Most of the species' range. *Onopordum acanthium subsp. gautieri (Rouy) Franco. France, Spain. *Onopordum acanthium subsp. parnassicum (Boiss. & Heldr.) Nyman. Greece. The genus botanical name is derived from the Ancient Greek words όνος (ónos=donkey), πέρδω (pérdo=to fart), and άκανθος (ácanthos=thorn), meaning 'donkey fart thorny food'.Bill Thayer, Pliny the Elder: the Natural History, Liber XXVIIPline l'Ancien, Histoire Naturelle, Tome second, Livre XXVII, Traduction française: É. LittréVaillant S., Etablissement de nouveaux caractères de trois Familles ou Classes de Plantes à Fleurs composées, à savoir des Cynarocéphales..., Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences. Avec les Mémoires de Mathematique & de Physique, Paris 4,: 152, 1718 The common name of cotton thistle derives from the cotton-like hairs on the leaves. Other names include Scots thistle or Scottish thistle, heraldic thistle and woolly thistle. The name Scots thistle comes from the flower used as the national emblem of Scotland. Despite its name, it has nothing to do with the actual thistle that is used as the emblem of Scotland, which is the Cirsium vulgare. ==Uses== It is grown as an ornamental plant for its bold foliage and large flowers.Holliday, C. (2005). Sharp Gardening. Timber Press It has been used to treat cancers and ulcers and to diminish discharges of mucous membranes. A recent study of a crude extract from the leaves of the plant proved the activity against glioblastoma cell line, a very malignant brain tumor.Abusamra YA et.al., 2015. Evaluation of putative cytotoxic activity of crude extracts from Onopordum acanthium leaves and Spartium junceum flowers against the U-373 glioblastoma cell line. Pak J Pharm Sci. 2015 Jul;28(4):1225-32. The receptacle was eaten in earlier times like an artichoke. The cottony hairs on the stem have been occasionally collected to stuff pillows. Oil from the seeds has been used for burning and cooking.Henriette's Herbal: Onopordum acanthium Thistles produce abundant nectar for pollinators and provide seeds and floss for birds such as the goldfinch. Large-flowered tall thistles in particular provide considerable nectar. ==Invasive species== Galong, Australia An example of Onopordum acanthium in southwest Idaho In the late 19th century, it was introduced to temperate regions of North America, South America, and Australia as an ornamental plant, and is now considered a major agricultural and wildland noxious weed. It has been recorded from nearly 50 countries. It is difficult to eradicate because of its drought resistance. It can spread rapidly and eventually dense stands prohibit foraging by livestock. Infestations of cotton thistle often start in disturbed areas such as roadways, campsites, burned areas, and ditch banks. The weed adapts best to areas along rivers and streams, but can be a serious problem in pastures, grain fields and range areas. A single plant is imposing enough, but an entire colony can ruin a pasture or destroy a park or campsite, sometimes forming tall, dense, impenetrable stands. This issue is often amplified by the prolific thorns found on this species. Besides creating an impenetrable barrier to humans and animals, the plant nearly eliminates forage use by livestock and some mammal species such as deer and elk.Global Invasive Species Database: Onopordum acanthium Known infestations include most of the Pacific Northwest along with Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota. On western rangeland, infestations directly result in significant economic losses for ranchers. It is also widespread in Australia and New Zealand.Tamar Valley Weed Strategy: Cotton Thistle In Australia it commonly hybridises with the related invasive Onopordum illyricum. ===Control=== ;Mechanical Small infestations may be physically removed or cut a few centimetres below the soil surface ensuring that no leaves remain attached to prevent regrowth. Mowing during early flowering will not kill the plant but will reduce seed production. Repeated treatments may be required because populations typically exhibit a wide range of developmental stages among individual plants. Slashing should be done prior to flowering since seed may mature in the seed head after cutting. Plants should not be mowed following seed set, as this increases chances for seed dispersal.Cotton Thistle (Onopordum acanthium L.) Control Guide ;Chemical Because of their shorter life cycle, cotton thistle plants can be effectively treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments should be applied at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling cotton thistle.Beck, K.G. (1991). Biennial thistle control with herbicides. In: James, L.F., J.O. Evans, M.H. Ralphs, and R.D. Child, eds. Noxious Range Weeds. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado. pp. 254-259. Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the family Asteraceae, but will also injure or kill legumes. ;Biological There are no biological control agents that have been specifically released for cotton thistle control in the United States. A thistle head weevil Rhinocyllus conicus that feeds on Carduus pycnocephalus has also been shown to feed on cotton thistle. This insect was the object of imprudent biological control introduction, and it became an invasive species that has threatened endangered native thistles in North America (Strong 1997). Establishment of this thistle head weevil as a biological control agent for cotton thistle has been unsuccessful in the Pacific Northwest. A thistle crown weevil (Trichosirocalus horridus) that feeds on musk, bull, plumeless, Italian, and creeping thistles will also feed on cotton thistle. In Australia, this insect has been shown to kill cotton thistle rosettes. The related Trichosirocalus briese is also being tested as a control agent. The Australian painted lady butterfly has been known to use this invasive species as a host plant, but the larvae do not do enough damage to the plant for this butterfly to be used as biological control agent. In Australia, a total of seven insects have been released to control cotton thistle.Swirepik, A., Smyth, M., 2002. Biological control of broad-leafed pasture weeds (Paterson's curse, Onopordum and nodding thistles): what have we achieved and where to from here?. In: Spafford J.H., Dodd, J., Moore, J.H. (Eds.), Proceedings of the 13th Australian Weeds Conference, Plant Protection of WA, Perth, pp. 373-376. Two of the seven released insects are weevils, including Larinus latus which feeds on the seeds, and Lixus cardui, which bores in the stems. ;Integrated management A combination of methods (IPM) is often more effective than any single method. An integrated pest management plan deals with prevention as well as control. Eradication of weed species is often not a practical goal, but in many cases reducing infestation to manageable levels is an achievable objective. Seed bank longevity is a major factor in managing cotton thistles. Re-establishing competitive perennial grasses and monitoring infested areas on a yearly basis is critical. Herbicides can successfully be used for reducing thistle populations and giving grasses a competitive advantage, but they cannot be used as a stand- alone solution. These techniques must be linked with good grazing practices in rangeland areas. Otherwise, the thistles will recolonize and rapidly replenish the seed bank to pre-control levels. ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Species Profile - Scotch Thistle (Onopordum acanthium), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.

Bush addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 12, 2002 to outline the complaints of the United States government against the Iraqi government == Richard Butler == Richard Butler, who led the UN inspection teams in Iraq until 1998, accused the United States of promoting \\"shocking double standards\\" in considering unilateral military action against Iraq. He said, \\"The spectacle of the United States, armed with its weapons of mass destruction, acting without Security Council authority to invade a country in the heartland of Arabia and, if necessary, use its weapons of mass destruction to win that battle, is something that will so deeply violate any notion of fairness in this world that I strongly suspect it could set loose forces that we would deeply live to regret.\\" In pointing out that the United States has not responded in the same way to Syria, which is also suspected of having weapons of mass destruction, and that several US allies, including Pakistan, India, and Israel, have such weapons without having signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, Butler asked why the United States is \\"permitting the persistence of such shocking double standards\\". However, part of the U.S.'s position is that Iraq is a unique case. Iraq is the only country out of this list that has had 12 years of defiance against 17 U.N. resolutions calling for its disarmament. Butler himself, upon leaving Iraq for the last time in 1998 said he could not say that Iraq had disarmed. Nor could he confirm that Iraq possessed WMDs. ==Pope John Paul II== In 2003, the Vatican of Pope John Paul II tried to prevent the US-led invasion of Iraq, instead urging a peaceful solution. In his 2003 State of the World address, the Pope declared his opposition to the invasion by stating, \\"No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity.\\"John Paul II, \\"Address to the Diplomatic Corps,\\" Vatican, 13 January 2003 (Retrieved 7 February 2007). He sent former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States Pío Cardinal Laghi to talk with American President George W. Bush to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law. == Nelson Mandela == In February, 2003, Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa, sharply criticized Bush and his drive for war, saying, \\"If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America.\\" Mandela also said, \\"One power with a president who has no foresight – who cannot think properly – is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust.\\" Mandela also accused Bush of \\"ignoring the U.N.\\". Mandela went on by asking \\"Is this because the secretary general of the United Nations is now a black man?\\" Mandela and Sir Richard Branson planned, with Kofi Annan's blessing, a secret trip to Iraq to convince Saddam to step down, but the bombing starting just before they were to leave.Branson planned Mandela mission to prevent Iraq war, The Scotsman, December 18, 2004 Bush's supporters argue that he had been working through the U.N. on this issue since the previous September; however, he and his Cabinet made it clear that they would act with or without UN agreement. == Scott Ritter == As of August 2002, former UNSCOM weapons inspector Scott Ritter, who believes U.N. inspections effectively verified the destruction of over 90% of Iraq's weapon capabilities, is actively campaigning against an invasion, and challenging the Bush administration to make public any evidence that Iraq has rebuilt the capabilities which were destroyed under the auspices of UNSCOM. Says Ritter, \\"If Iraq was producing weapons today, we would have definitive proof.\\" However, critics of Ritter point out that four years earlier he had exactly the opposite view as inspectors were forced to leave Iraq. In 1998, upon leaving Iraq, Ritter sharply criticized the Clinton administration and the U.N. Security Council for not being vigorous enough about insisting that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction be destroyed. Ritter also accused U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan of assisting Iraqi efforts at impeding UNSCOM's work. \\"Iraq is not disarming,\\" Ritter said on August 27, 1998, and in a second statement, \\"Iraq retains the capability to launch a chemical strike.\\" == Mary Robinson == Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and ex-president of Ireland Mary Robinson was also highly critical, in an article published in The Irish Times. == Lech Wałęsa == Leader of the opposition to the communist regime in Poland during the 1980s, former president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Lech Wałęsa supports the invasion and said that the UN should accept the war because it has done nothing worthy of its name in the last few years. == Václav Havel == The most well known and highly regarded dissident in Communist Czechoslovakia and later President of democratic Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic, Václav Havel spoke in favour of a projected American and Allied invasion of Iraq as early as September 2002, stating that \\"Saddam Hussein's regime poses a major threat to many nations and to his own people ... there should be international intervention.\\" == Adam Michnik == Adam Michnik, the most important intellectual of the Polish Solidarity movement, also issued statements in support of the war, pointing to historical reasons for the former eastern bloc countries' support for the American action in Iraq. == Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton == Former American Presidents Carter and Clinton have both offered criticism on the war. While Clinton was in favor of regime change, and supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he strongly objected to the ways in which he perceived the Bush administration to be ignoring the will of the America's traditional allies and undermining proper UN procedures. President Carter opposed the war entirely, and the Carter Center outlined a specific \\"alternative to war\\" plan that involved an increased presence of weapons inspectors. ==References== Category:Iraq War Category:Stances and opinions regarding the Iraq War ","title":"International figures' positions on invasion of Iraq"},{"id":"514918","text":"The year 1947 saw a number of significant happenings in radio broadcasting history. __TOC__ ==Events== *10 February – Nederlandse Radio Unie is established. *17 February – Voice of America begins shortwave radio transmissions to the Soviet Union. *19 February – CBS Radio premiere performance of Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras No. 3. *March – Margaret Truman, daughter of US President Harry S.

Cursive handwriting is very functional, and is intended to be used in everyday writing. Other than that, it is also used in art and calligraphy hand-lettering. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as \\"looped\\", \\"italic\\" or \\"connected\\". The cursive method is used with many alphabets due to infrequent pen lifting and beliefs that it increases writing speed. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. A 2013 study found that speed of writing cursive is the same, regardless if the children first learned print handwriting or first learned disjoint handwriting. == Descriptions == Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a conjoined and/or flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from \\"print-script\\" using block letters, in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letter-form rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive copybooks join all letters: formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the Arabic, Syriac, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected (while other must not), sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In Hebrew cursive and Roman cursive, the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra, there is a version of Cursive called 'Modi' === Subclasses ===  Ligature  Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters. Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called \\"cursive\\" (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.  Looped  Looped cursive as taught in Britain in the mid-20th century In looped cursive penmanship, some ascenders and descenders have loops which provide for joins. This is generally what people refer to when they say \\"cursive\\".  Italic  Cursive italic penmanship—derived from chancery cursive—uses non-looped joins or no joins. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged. Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term \\"italic\\" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with italic typed letters. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic. == Origin == The origins of the cursive method are associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the quill. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. They also run out of ink faster than most contemporary writing utensils. Steel dip pens followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see Signature) was a factor also, as opposed to machine font. Cursive was also favored because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper. The term cursive derives from Middle French cursif from Medieval Latin cursivus, which literally means running. This term in turn derives from Latin currere (\\"to run, hasten\\"). Although the use of cursive appeared to be on the decline, it now seems to be coming back into use. == Bengali == Half of the National Anthem of Bangladesh, written in cursive Bengali In Bengali cursive script (also known in Bengali as \\"professional writing\\") the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter (matra) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the standard Bengali alphabet as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting. == Roman == Example of old Roman cursive Roman cursive is a form of handwriting (or a script) used in ancient Rome and to some extent into the Middle Ages. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called majuscule cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even by emperors issuing commands. New Roman, also called minuscule cursive or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; \\"a\\", \\"b\\", \\"d\\", and \\"e\\" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line. == Greek == Ancient Greek cursive script, 6th century CE The Greek alphabet has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on papyrus. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many ligatures. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed. == Western Europe  English === Cursive in English letter from 1894 William Shakespeare's will, written in secretary handCardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy, pp. 131–3: By William Shakespeare, Charles Hamilton, John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) Cursive writing was used in English before the Norman conquest. Anglo-Saxon Charters typically include a boundary clause written in Old English in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—secretary hand—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century. Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the British Empire. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of William Bradford, though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French ronde style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the British Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries as round hand by John Ayers and William Banson. In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, it is notable that Thomas Jefferson joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the United States Declaration of Independence. However, a few days later, Timothy Matlack professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, Abraham Lincoln drafted the Gettysburg Address in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today. Not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word. Cursive handwriting from the 19th-century USA. In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a \\"fair hand\\", meaning it looked good, and firms trained their clerks to write in exactly the same script. In the early days of the post office, letters were written in cursive – and to fit more text on a single sheet, the text was continued in lines crossing at 90 degrees from the original text. Block letters were not suitable for this. Although women's handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men's, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached. After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by Paul Standard in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be: that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, a number of various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including Getty-Dubay, and Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are Spencerian, Palmer Method, D'Nealian, and Zaner-Bloser script.  Decline of English cursive in the United States  D'Nealian Script, a cursive alphabet, shown in lower case and upper case One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the ballpoint pen, patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. With their design, it was guaranteed that the ink would not smudge, as it would with the earlier design of pen, and it no longer required the careful penmanship one would use with the older design of pen. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold for a cheap price, changing the way people wrote. Over time the emphasis of using the style of cursive to write slowly declined, only to be later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard. Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century due to its perceived lack of necessity. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a \\"dying art\\". Many consider cursive too tedious to learn and believe that it is not a useful skill. On the 2006 SAT, a United States post-secondary education entrance exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive. However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests due to exams written in hard-to-read handwriting receiving fewer marks, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive. In a 2007 survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive. A 2008 nationwide survey found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting to students. Only 12 percent of teachers reported having taken a course in how to teach it. In 2012, the American states of Indiana and Hawaii announced that their schools will no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach \\"keyboard proficiency\\". Since the nationwide proposal of the Common Core State Standards in 2009, which do not include instruction in cursive, the standards have been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011, all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.\\"Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools\\". Education. The Huffington Post. 1 August 2011.  Conservation efforts and cognitive benefits  Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format. Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of schools in the United States. States such as California, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, and Tennessee have already mandated cursive in schools as a part of the Back to Basics program designed to maintain the integrity of cursive handwriting. Cursive instruction is required by grade 5 in Illinois, starting with the 2018–2019 school year. Some argue that cursive is not worth teaching in schools and \\"in the 1960s cursive was implemented because of preference and not an educational basis; Hawaii and Indiana have replaced cursive instruction with 'keyboard proficiency' and 44 other states are currently weighing similar measures.\\" With the widespread use of computers, researchers set out to test the effectiveness of both mediums. In a study done by Pam Mueller which compared scores of students who took notes by hand and via laptop computer showed that students who took notes by hand showed advantages in both factual and conceptual learning. Another study done by Anne Mangen showed that children showed an acceleration in learning new words when they wrote them by hand rather than on a computer screen. Learning to write in cursive is alleged (by its practitioners) to be a stepping stone to developing neat handwriting, and, in a third study conducted by Florida International University, professor Laura Dinehart concluded that students with neater handwriting tend to develop better reading and writing skills, though it is difficult to conclude causation from such an association. Aside from these cognitive benefits, students with dyslexia, who have difficulty learning to read because their brains have difficulty associating sounds and letter combinations efficiently, have found that cursive can help them with the decoding process because it integrates hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and other brain and memory functions. However, students with dysgraphia may be badly served, or even substantially hindered, by demands for cursive. === German === Up to the 19th century, (also known as German cursive) was used in German-language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but rather in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of , , was widely used in the period 1911–1941 until the Nazi Party banned it and its printed equivalent . German speakers brought up with continued to use it well into the post-war period. Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the (introduced in 1953), the (1968), and the (1969). The German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union has proposed replacing all three with , a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by Hamburg schools. == Russian == The standard modern Russian Cyrillic cursive alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, used in school education The Russian Cursive Cyrillic alphabet is used (instead of the block letters) when handwriting the modern Russian language. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet, although use of block letters in private writing has been rising. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the 1st grade how to write using this Russian script. == Chinese == Cursive forms of Chinese characters are used in calligraphy; \\"running script\\" is the semi- cursive form and \\"rough script\\" (mistakenly called \\"grass script\\" due to misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes within an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in hanzi and in the derived Japanese kanji characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

Begala was a chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton–Gore campaign, which carried 33 states and made Clinton the first Democrat to occupy the White House in twelve years. As counselor to the President in the Clinton White House, he coordinated policy, politics, and communications. Begala gained national prominence as part of the political consulting team Carville and Begala, along with fellow Clinton advisor James Carville. He was a co-host on the political debate program Equal Time on MSNBC from 1999 to 2000, and a co-host on the similar debate program Crossfire on CNN from 2002 to 2005. He now appears regularly on CNN as a Democratic pundit. He is an Affiliated Professor of Public Policy at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. == Early life and education == Begala was born in New Jersey, to an Irish American mother, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" (née Cass), and a Hungarian American father, David Begala. He was raised in Missouri City, Texas, where his father was an oil-field equipment salesman. In 1979, Begala graduated from Dulles High School in Sugar Land, Texas. He earned both his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor from the University of Texas at Austin, where he taught briefly. While at the University of Texas, Begala was a candidate for student government president. However, he finished second to a write-in campaign for Hank the Hallucination, a character from the campus comic strip Eyebeam. Following his loss, Begala wrote a tongue-in-cheek complaint for the Daily Texan, arguing \\"I cannot help but feel Hank's platform is illusory at best...I must say that the candidate himself lacks substance\\". Begala was declared the winner, following a ruling that imaginary characters could not hold the position.SG helps foster future leaders , The Daily Texan, April 19, 2004; accessed February 5, 2008. == Career == Begala in 2005 Begala, along with business partner James Carville, helped then-Governor of Arkansas Clinton win the 1992 presidential election. Begala was a chief strategist for the 1992 Clinton–Gore campaign. Clinton carried 33 states and became the first Democrat elected President since 1976. Begala later served as a counselor to the President in the Clinton White House, where he coordinated policy, politics, and communications. Aside from the 1992 presidential election, Begala and Carville had other well-known political victories including the 1991 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate victory of Harris Wofford, the 1988 re-election campaign of incumbent New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, and the gubernatorial victories of Robert Casey in Pennsylvania in 1986, Wallace G. Wilkinson in Kentucky in 1987, and Zell Miller in Georgia in 1990. Begala later revealed he had favored his former client, Pennsylvania senator Harris Wofford, over Al Gore as Bill Clinton's running mate in the 1992 presidential election. He was a contributor to John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s political magazine George in the late 1990s. From 1999 until its cancellation in 2000, Begala co- hosted the political debate show Equal Time with Oliver North on MSNBC. From 2002 until its cancellation in 2005, he co-hosted the political debate show Crossfire on CNN, alternating with Carville as the left-wing host, while the position of right-wing host alternated between Robert Novak and Tucker Carlson. As an author and co-author, Begala has written five political books: Is Our Children Learning?: The Case Against George W. Bush; Buck Up, Suck Up and Come Back When You Foul Up (with James Carville); It's Still the Economy Stupid; and Third Term: Why George W. Bush (Hearts) John McCain. He was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential primaries. However, after she dropped out of the race, he became a backer of Barack Obama. On January 12, 2008, Begala appeared on NPR's radio show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, playing the game Not My Job. He won by answering two out of three questions correctly. Begala was a consultant in the service of mortgage lender Freddie Mac, an arrangement that ended in September 2008.Calmes, Jackie; Kirkpatrick, David D. \\"McCain Aide's Firm Was Paid by Freddie Mac\\", New York Times, September 23, 2008; accessed November 8, 2008. Begala is currently a CNN political commentator and a research professor of public policy at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy. He is a member of the board of directors of Democratic Majority for Israel, an organization that promotes U.S.-Israel cooperation and whose political arm, DMFI PAC, ran attack ads against Senator Bernie Sanders's candidacy before the 2020 presidential election. Looking back at his career and the U.S. political scene, Begala has remarked that a \\"presidential campaign is like a film. It never comes together until it's scored and tracked\\". == Personal life == Begala and his wife, Diane Friday, have four sons.

The core personnel of Flagship Studios had been collaborating as a team since 1993 when they founded Condor Studios (later bought out and renamed Blizzard North) and in addition to creating the Diablo franchise many were key high level executives in the development of Warcraft, StarCraft and World of Warcraft games. Flagship Studios was formed following the resignation en masse of Blizzard North management following a dispute with Blizzard Entertainment parent company Vivendi regarding the potential fate of the company, development team, and titles, which were in doubt at that time. Flagship Studio's primary target platform for their games was the PC. Flagship Studios had a partnership with Namco Hometek and HanbitSoft to cover an international market for game marketing and distribution. The company dissolved in August 2008 because of financial troubles. Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer moved on to help form Runic Games. ==TitlesHellgate: London=== In March 2005, following months of teasing concept art for an unknown game, Flagship Studios' first title named Hellgate: London was announced via an exclusive article in the computer magazine PC Gamer. It was formally released October 31, 2007 as an action role-playing game (RPG) in the same vein as the Diablo games, but with the twist of being played in 3D, primarily from a first-person perspective. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic demon-infested London, following a great battle between demons and humans. Unlike regular first- person shooters, the game features RPG content in the form of e.g. random quests, and where a character's combat efficiency is more determined by statistics than player reflexes. In addition, the game features random levels, uncommon in games of similar perspective and scale. Expectations from the game were high, as earlier games the developers have been involved in, especially titles from Blizzard Entertainment, have become best sellers with few exceptions. However, it received mixed reviews, and complaints by many gamers that the game was released in an unfinished state, which was later admitted by CEO Bill Roper. The company no longer owns the intellectual property rights to the game. ===Mythos=== Mythos was a game under development by a division of Flagship Studios commonly called \\"Flagship Seattle\\". An online RPG, similar in style to Diablo, the game was used to test the networking technology behind the multiplayer component of Hellgate: London. It was expected to be free to play and download, although the financing model was never set in stone. Following the layoffs at Flagship Studios due to the financial issues, the intellectual property rights over Mythos have now been claimed by the Korean company Hanbitsoft, which was offered as collateral for loans earlier in the year. Mythos lead designer Travis Baldree and Flagship Studios co-founder Max Schaefer have subsequently formed the new game company Runic Games along with the remaining staff of 14 behind the game from Flagship Seattle.

This species has now been accidentally introduced into the United States, where it was first discovered in 1996, as well as Canada, and several countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and UK. This beetle is believed to have been spread from Asia in solid wood packaging material. ==Taxonomy and description== Common names for A. glabripennis in Asia are the starry sky beetle, basicosta white-spotted longicorn beetle, or smooth shoulder-longicorn, and it is called the Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) in North America. Adults are very large insects with bodies ranging from in length and antennae which can be as long as or 1.5-2 times longer than the body of the insect. They are shiny black with about 20 white spots on each wing cover and long antennae conspicuously banded black and white. These beetles can fly, but generally only for short distances, which is a common limitation for Cerambycidae of their size and weight. The upper sections of the legs of the adults are whitish-blue. A. glabripennis can be distinguished from related species by the markings on the wing covers and the pattern of the antennae. ==Range and habitat== Asian long-horned beetle is native to eastern Asia, primarily in eastern China and Korea. Japan is often erroneously included in its native range. It is invasive outside its native range. In its native range, A. glabripennis primarily infests plants like maple, poplar, willow, and elm trees. In the United States, A. glabripennis has completed development on species of these genera and also Aesculus, Albizia, birch, katsura, ash, planes, and Sorbus. In Canada, complete development has been confirmed only on maple, birch, poplar, and willow, although oviposition has occurred on other tree genera. Maple is the most commonly infested tree genus in North America, followed by elm and willow. In Europe, complete development has been recorded on maple, Aesculus, alder, birch, hornbeam, beech, ash, planes, poplar, Prunus, willow, and Sorbus. The top five host genera infested in Europe, in decreasing order, are maple, birch, willow, Aesculus, and poplar. Not all poplar species are equally susceptible to attack. First detections of Asian long-horned beetle in North America as of July 2, 2015. In North America, established populations were first discovered in August 1996 in Brooklyn, New York and has since been found in other areas of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, and Ontario in Canada.September 18, 2003 Asian Longhorned Beetle discovered in York Region However, it has also been eradicated from some regions within these states and provinces. In Europe, established populations have been found in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, though the beetle had also been intercepted in areas through inspection of international trade goods such as wood packaging. ==Life cycles== Egg-laying site chewed by the female Asian long-horned beetle. Adult females lay 45-62 eggs in their lifetime by chewing a small pit through the bark of the host tree to the cambium and lay one long egg underneath the bark in each pit. Eggs hatch in 13-54 days depending on temperature. Eggs that have not developed enough, such as those laid in late summer or early fall, will overwinter and hatch the following season. Larvae are cylindrical and elongate and can be long and wide. Larvae first create a feeding gallery in the cambial region, but more mature larvae tunnel to the heartwood as they feed. Larvae go through at least five instars over 1-2 years; which can vary due to host or temperature conditions. Larvae expel frass from their tunnels near the original oviposition site. A larva can consume up to 1,000 cubic cm of wood in its lifetime. Asian long-horned beetle larvae do not pupate before they reach a critical weight, so additional larval instars can occur. Pupation usually occurs in spring at the end of the larval tunnel in the sapwood, eclosion occurs 12–50 days later, and adults will chew out of the tree approximately one week after eclosion. Adults feed on leaf petioles and can chew through bark on small branches to feed on the vascular cambium. Eggs, larvae or as pupae can overwinter within the tree. In their overwintering phase, pupae are inactive and development does not occur. They resume their life cycle when temperatures are above . Upon emergence, adult females can copulate, although an obligatory maturation period is required for feeding after emergence for ovarian maturation. Laboratory studies have estimated the female maturation period lasts 9–15 days. Adult males have mature spermatozoa before emergence, and feeding is necessary only to sustain their normal activity. Adults typically lay eggs on the plant they developed on during immature stages rather than colonizing new plants unless population density is high or the host plant is dead. However, when they do disperse, they can travel up to approximately from their host tree in a growing season in search of new hosts, although in a mark-recapture experiment about 98% of adults were recaptured within of their release point. Adults will typically infest the crown and main branches first and will begin to infest the trunk as the crown dies. Adult longevity and fecundity are influenced by conditions such as the larval host plant and temperature. Laboratory reared males and females can live up to 202 and 158 days, respectively.

File:ALBadult.jpgAdult beetle. ==As an invasive species== Due to high tree mortality caused by larval feeding outside its native range, A. glabripennis can change both forest and urban ecosystems. In the United States, it can potentially destroy 30.3% of urban trees and cause $669 billion in economic loss. Early detection is used to manage infestations before they can spread. ===Monitoring=== Tree infestation can be detected by looking for exit holes 3/8 to 3/4 inches in diameter (1–2 cm) often in the larger branches of the crowns of infested trees. Sometimes sap can be seen oozing from the exit holes with coarse sawdust or \\"frass\\" in evidence on the ground or lower branches. Dead and dying tree limbs or branches and yellowing leaves when there has been no drought also indicate A. glabripennis infestation. Traps can also be used containing a pheromone and a plant kairomone to attract nearby adults. Some acoustic sensors can also differentiate larval feeding within trees. Dogs can also be trained to detect the smell of frass on trees. Workers have found and reported infested material in warehouses in CA, FL, IL, IN, MA, MI, NC, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA, and WI in the United States, and in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada. After an aggressive containment program and with the last confirmed sighting in 2007, Canada declared itself free of the beetle on April 5, 2013 and lifted restrictions on the movement of tree materials. In September 1998, US customs regulations were changed to require wooden packing materials from China be chemically treated or kiln-dried to prevent further infestations of the Asian long-horned beetle from arriving. Pest inspection, new rules, and public awareness are the key steps to prevention of the spread of the Asian long-horned beetle. ===Quarantine=== Quarantines have been established around infested areas to prevent accidental spread of A. glabripennis by humans. The use of solid wood packing materials for maritime shipping is regulated for adequate treatment methods at certain ports. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is spearheading efforts to fight the ALB infestation in the Greater Toronto Area. ===Management=== All infested trees should be removed by certified tree care personnel to ensure that the process is completed properly, and chipped in place, their stumps ground to below the soil level. Insecticides such as imidacloprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran have been used to target adult beetles in canopies or as trunk injections to target larvae. Insecticides within the tree may not translocate evenly, which allows some A. glabripennis to survive treatments. Combined with efficacy concerns, high cost, and non-target effects on other insects, widespread prophylactic treatment of trees in an infestation area concern scientists. Over 1,550 trees in Chicago have been cut down and destroyed to eradicate A. glabripennis from Chicago. In New York, over 6,000 infested trees resulted in the removal of over 18,000 trees; New Jersey's infestation of over 700 trees led to the removal and destruction of almost 23,000 trees,Newspaper Archive (dead link as of at least March 16, 2009) but infested trees continue to be discovered. Some resistant trees have been developed that quickly fill oviposition pits with sap or produce callous tissue that encases and kills eggs. Non-host species are typically used to replace removed trees. Biological control has also been considered in some areas such as China. Fungi such as Beauveria brongniartii can increase mortality in larvae and adults while Metarhizium brunneum and Beauveria asiatica can reduce adult survival time. Most parasitoids in the native range of A. glabripennis have a broad host range, and are not suitable as classical biological control agents. Woodpeckers can also be a significant source of mortality. Countries working towards eradicating A. glabripennis typically do not initially utilize biological control. Eradication In areas such as North America where infestations are small, A. glabripennis can potentially be eradicated. As trees are removed or treated, all host trees on public and private property located within an established distance from an infested area are surveyed by trained personnel. Infested areas are re-surveyed at least once per year for 3–5 years after the last beetle or infested tree is found. A. glabripennis has been eradicated from Islip, Manhattan, and Staten Island in New York, Jersey City in New Jersey, Chicago in Illinois, and Boston in Massachusetts. It was also declared eradicated in Toronto and Vaughan, Ontario, but it was rediscovered there in 2013. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared New York City free of the beetle, after a 23-year-long battle. In June 2020, Marie-Claude Bibeau (the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) and Seamus O'Regan (the Minister of Natural Resources) declared that A. glabripennis had been eradicated in Mississauga and Toronto, the only two areas of known infestation in Canada. In 2012, the first recorded outbreak of Asian longhorn beetle in the UK was found at Paddock Wood in Kent, near small commercial premises that had imported stone from China. Novel techniques used to control the outbreak included the use of two detection dogs trained in Austria that can smell the beetles in trees. At the end of the first year’s survey, 1,500 trees had been felled and burned from fields and roadsides and 700 from commercial premises and private gardens. The beetle was declared eradicated in 2019. ==See also== *Citrus long-horned beetle *Emerald ash borer *Forest disturbance of invasive insects and diseases in the United States ==References== ==External links== *Asian longhorned beetle in Europe - life cycle, significance and combat infestation. *USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Asian long-horned beetle site. *Asian Long-horned Beetle, Natural Resources Canada *Bugged: The Race To Eradicate The Asian Longhorned Beetle Asian long-horned beetle Documentary *Forest Disturbance Processes - Asian Longhorned Beetle.

Renovated shikumen lanes in Xintiandi. Shikumen buildings in the process of demolition in 2007 – a fate that has befallen many buildings of this type. Shikumen (; Shanghainese: zakumen) is a traditional Shanghainese architectural style combining Western and Chinese elements that first appeared in the 1860s. At the height of their popularity, there were 9000 shikumen- style buildings in Shanghai, comprising 60% of the total housing stock of the city, but today the proportion is much lower as most Shanghainese live in large apartment buildings. Shikumen is classified as one type of lilong residences, sometimes translated as \\"lane houses\\" in English. In 2010, \\"construction techniques of shikumen lilong architecture\\" was recognised by the Chinese government on the national non-physical cultural heritage register (no. VIII-210). Shikumen houses were also introduced to other port cities in China. For example, many were built in the foreign concessions of Hankou (now part of Wuhan), and some can still be seen there today. Shikumen terraces can even be found as far afield as Beijing, where the two shikumen lanes Huakang Li and Tai’an Li, dating from the 1920s, are undergoing restoration. ==Structure== Shikumens are two- or three-story structures resembling Western terrace houses or townhouses, distinguished by high brick walls enclosing a narrow front yard. The name \\"stone gate\\" references these strong gateways. Each residence abuts another and all are arranged in straight side alleys called longtang (Chinese: t or , s , p lòngtáng; Shanghainese: longdhang). The entrance to each alley is usually surmounted by a stylistic stone arch. The shikumen is a cultural blend of the elements found in Western architecture with traditional Lower Yangtze architecture and social behavior. Traditional Chinese dwellings had a courtyard, and the Shikumen was no exception. Yet, to compromise with its urban nature, it was much smaller and provided an interior haven to the commotions in the streets, allowing for raindrops to fall and vegetation to grow freely within a residence.文汇报:从石库门走入上海城市文化 (Wen Wei Po: Stepping into Shanghai's urban culture through the Shikumen), Wen Wei Po 18 January 2010 The courtyard also allowed sunlight and improved ventilation into the rooms. ==HistoryOrigin=== longdang This style of housing originally developed when local developers adapted Western-style terrace houses to Chinese conditions.Shikumen architecture , Beijing Institute of Architectural Engineering Migrant labourers from surrounding provinces entered Shanghai in large numbers with the establishment of Shanghai as a treaty port in 1843. The 1853 Small Swords Rebellion and the Taiping Revolution drove more migrants and refugees into Shanghai. With the upsurge in demand, property developers began to build a large number of residential buildings for the new Chinese residents of the city. At first, these tended to be wooden buildings that were cheap and quick to build. These wooden buildings were built as terraces, and usually name with \\"Li\\" (里) as suffix. These were the first \\"lilong\\" buildings in Shanghai. Within 10 months from 1853, 800 dwellings of this type were built. Because of their flammability, this type of construction was banned by concession authorities in Shanghai. However, with a burgeoning property development market in Shanghai, developers adapted these wooden terraces into the Shikumen. They used the traditional Chinese \\"litie\\" technique of wooden frame and load-bearing brick veneer construction, and for each residence used the traditional three-sided courtyard or four-sided courtyard layouts commonly found in the Jiangnan region. Exterior of a shikumen residence, in the Chang Garden (张园) development A relatively elaborate \\"stone gate\\" with an archivolt and pediment, and columns inscribed with a couplet, from a Shikumen residence on North Xiangyang Road ===Development=== Shikumen residences had a much smaller footprint than traditional courtyard residences, and were accessed by narrow lanes. They were also cheaper to build than Western-style houses. Although more expensive to build than the wooden terraces they replaced, they were sturdier and so attracted higher rents. They were first built in the British concession (later part of the International Settlement; and still later, the pre-merger Huangpu District), but quickly became popular throughout the Old City and Chinese zones, and came to become the predominant form of residential construction in Shanghai. The high profit attracted a whole swathe of property companies to enter the shikumen market. From the 1910s, various innovations were made to the shikumen in response to social change. With a burgeoning middle class, designers increased the width of lanes between terraces, but the width of each dwelling decreased - from a three-bay hall and two side wings (as was standard in the 19th century) to a two-bay or one-bay hall, and one side wing. Decorations became more elaborate: the main doors of the houses acquired the characteristic elaborate lintels, featuring architraves, archivolts and pediments. By around 1919, increasing population pressures and an increasing wealth gap encouraged the development of smaller, but better equipped, \\"new type\\" shikumen. \\"New type\\" shikumen were three storeys tall instead of two, and were equipped with modern sanitary equipment. Great emphasis was placed on natural lighting, with most shikumen orientated towards the south, and an internal staircase skylight or atrium to supplement the front and back courtyards. Developments became larger, with a trunk lane leading off the street, and branch lanes leading off the trunk lane. Cars became more popular, so the trunk lanes were typically designed to accommodate cars. ===Later history=== The heyday of the \\"new type\\" shikumen was in the 1920s. From the 1930s they were replaced by newer building types, including newer types of lilong residences, as well as larger modern apartment buildings, before the civil war and the Second Sino-Japanese War completely disrupted the property market in Shanghai. It was common for families who could not afford the rent on a whole house to sub-let some of the rooms. They were known as \\"second landlords\\" (, èr fángdōng) (as opposed to the head-landlord (, dà fángdōng)). \\"Second landlords\\" often lived in the same shikumen residence with their tenants.区县志 >> 区志 >> 黄浦区志 >> 第十一编特色建筑 >> 第三章石库门房屋 >> 第三节 使用状况 上海地方志办公室. The phenomenon blossomed after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War: with refugees rushing into the unoccupied concessions from the Chinese zones in Hongkou and Zhabei, and further afield, there was dramatically increased demand for housing in the concessions. \\"Second landlords\\" used increasingly creative ways to sub-divide rooms and build add-ons and lean-tos in the courtyards and on the terraces. Shikumen residences became known for being crowded and disorderly. It was not uncommon for a single shikumen residence to be inhabited by dozens of families. A famous satirical comedy of the time, set in one of these houses, was called \\"The 72 Tenant Families\\" (《七十二家房客》). ===Use=== Although designed to be residential, other types of enterprises often operated from shikumen buildings as well, hidden within longtang developments. These include money lenders, traders, scribes, factories, entertainment venues and even schools. For example, one larger shikumen development, Xingren Li, featured more than 20 money lenders. Often, traders would use the ground floor rooms for storage, and live in the upper floors. Chemical and dye dealers were common. Even light industry was found within shikumen communities, such as sock factories and cosmetics factories. Even more common (and common even today in surviving and renovated shikumen lanes) are grocers, restaurants, inns and bath houses. Densely populated shikumen neighbourhoods provided camouflage for revolutionaries. The Communist Party of China held its first conference in a shikumen residence in Shude Li, and its second conference in another shikumen residence in the French Concession. The Communist Youth League first operated out of a shikumen residence on Avenue Joffre. Shikumen neighbourhoods were also often used for less salubrious trades. The lanes Huile Li and Qunyu Fang, on Foochow Road (now Fuzhou Road), formed the epicentre of Shanghai's red light district before 1949. Gambling and opium dens commonly appeared in shikumen neighbourhoods, along with fortune tellers. ===Demise=== By the late 1930s, shikumen buildings were already on their way out, overtaken by newer styles of lilong residences, and large apartment buildings. Commercial property development in Shanghai virtually ceased during the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War that followed it. After the end of the war 1949, shikumen construction ceased completely, replaced with planned construction of residential buildings on collectivist principles.区县志 >> 区志 >> 静安区志 >> 第八编房屋建筑 >> 第三章旧有住宅 >> 第四节 旧式里弄住宅 上海地方志办公室. In the early 1950s, it was calculated that there were more than 9000 shikumen buildings, comprising 65% of residential housing stock by area in Shanghai. While constructions of new residential buildings decreased this percentage over time, most shikumen neighbourhoods remained unchanged in their crowded state until economic reforms in the 1980s and 90s began the wave of demolition and reconstruction which, by the early 21st century, has left only a few shikumen developments intact. In Xuhui District alone, it has been calculated that shikumen residences had decreased from 2.68 million square metres in 1949, to 0.25 million square metres by the late 1990s.区县志 >> 区志 >> 徐汇区志 >> 第十四篇房屋建筑 >> 第二章里弄住宅 >> 第一节 旧式里弄 上海地方志办公室. The forced demolition of crowded and stable shikumen communities gave rise to controversies, such as a 2005 incident where a developer resorted to arson to persuade residents to leave, resulting in the death of two elderly residents. ==Classification and architecture== An entrance to a shikumen lilong on Shanhaiguan Road Architectural historians classify shikumen into two types, the \\"old type\\" and the \\"new type\\". The old type was predominantly built from the 1860s until the end of the First World War, while the new type prevailed from after the First World War until the development of shikumen ceased after 1949. Old type shikumen is further divided into an early period and a late period. The defining characteristic of a shikumen building is the prominent main gate - which also gives rise to the name \\"shikumen\\". Typically, this gate is located on the central axis of each dwelling, with twin doors made of heavy wood, painted glossy black. Typical width is around 1.4 metres, with a height of around 2.8 metres. The doors usually possess brass or iron knockers.典雅幽深的石库门和江南民居 (Sikumen and Jiangnan residential architecture), Local History Office of Shanghai The original documented name for such buildings was \\"shigumen\\" (石箍門), which in Shanghainese Wu meant \\"gate framed with stone\\", but over time corrupted into the similar-sounding \\"shikumen\\". Each individual dwelling displays typical characteristics of traditional Jiangnan architecture, while the layout of the development as a whole is adopted from Western terrace houses. ===Old type=== Early period An old image of Xingren Li (street front buildings pictured), a typical old type shikumen development from the early period. A shikumen lane in Zhenxing Li A traditional Chinese matou (\\"horse head\\") style gable - more typical of old type shikumen - seen at Jianye Li, a new type shikumen development. Early period old type shikumen were built between 1869 and 1910. They retained more of the style of traditional Chinese houses, but with a much condensed footprint. There are typically 3 to 5 bays to each dwelling, and two storeys. They used the traditional litie (立帖) (or \\"brick nogging\\") style of brick veneer for load-bearing walls. The houses possessed walls of equal height at the front and back, so that each dwelling (despite being part of a terrace) was an enclosed whole, separated from the outside world. This made them popular with the upper end of the residential property market. The early period shikumen also possessed more features of traditional Chinese architecture: on the external façade of the terrace there are often typically Chinese matou (\\"horse head\\") style or Guanyin dou (\\"Guanyin hood\\") style gables; the main hall uses floor-to-ceiling windows; decorative boards below eaves; and grid windows on the side wings. However, in contrast to later shikumen buildings, the gates of early period shikumen were not elaborately decorated, and were simply framed in stone. In terms of layout, the shikumen of this period were arranged in lanes of about 3 metres wide - narrower than later buildings - and the attention to orientation, and organization of trunk lanes and branch lanes, both features of later shikumen, were also absent. In terms of internal lay-out, immediately within the main gate is the front courtyard (tianjing 天井), flanked by wings (xiangfang 厢房) of the house on the left and right. At the centre, facing the courtyard is the hall, or ketang jian (客堂间). This large room typically has an area of about 12 square metres, and is used like a modern sitting room or living room. On either side of the hall are the cijian (次间) or \\"secondary rooms\\". Stairs to reach the first floor are located behind the cijian. Behind the hall and the cijian is the back courtyard (houtianjing 后天井), which is about half the size of the front courtyard. The well, which provided water for the house, was located here (though later houses were connected to tap water instead). At the back of the back courtyard are back buildings, usually used as the kitchen, toilet and storage room. On the whole, each dwelling preserved the main features required for traditional Chinese day-to-day living, while saving the land required. Most early period old style shikumen have been demolished or rebuilt. Representative examples include the Xingren Li, built in 1872 (demolished 1980), and Mianyang Li and Jixiang Li, both located near the Shiliupu dock area. Late period An empty lane in East Siwen Li, just before demolition began Late period shikumen were mostly built between 1910 and 1919. The three-bay wide frontage with two side wings was reduced to one- or two-bay wide, with one side wing. The back courtyard was reduced, but more attention was paid to natural lighting, and the laneways were widened. More Western architectural details found favour: bannisters, doors and windows, staircase, pillar capitals and arch buttresses all used Western decorative styles. The lintel of the main gate also became increasingly elaborate, decorated with semicircular archivolts, triangular pediments or rectangular architraves. Late period old type shikumen are far better preserved than early period examples. Representative examples include the west and east Siwen Li (in the process of being demolished), north Shude Li, and Daqing Li, built in 1915. One of the few old type shikumen developments to be preserved largely intact is Bugao Li, or Cité Bourgogne (built in the 1930s), in the former French Concession. ===New type=== A branch lane in Siming Cun, showing the characteristic gate leading to a residence. The trunk lane of Siming Cun, a new type shikumen New type shikumen were typically built from 1919 to the 1930s. They were also called \\"reformed style\\" shikumen residences. The main structural difference between new type and old type shikumen is that new style buildings are three storeys high. They were built of reinforced concrete, rather than brick veneer. Some were equipped with modern sanitary equipment, and natural lighting became a key concern. Developments are typically laid out with a main, trunk lane, with houses arranged along branch lanes leading from the trunk lane. With the advent of motor cars, the trunk lanes were usually built wide enough to accommodate cars. Instead of one lane with one or two rows of houses, new style shikumen were typically developed in large blocks. Standard triangular gables and party walls replaced the more elaborate matou or Guanyin dou styles, with concrete tops. Exposed brick was used for external walls. The main gate frame also switched from stone to brick and painted stone cladding. The architectural style became far more Westernised overall. Each dwelling was one to two bays wide. Two-bay wide houses \\"inherited\\" only one side wing, while one-bay wide houses discarded wings completely. Stairs became less steep. The new second floor typically contained bedrooms, along with a front and a back terrace (shaitai, 晒台). The ground floor were equipped with kitchens (zaopi jian 灶批间). At the back of the house, a \\"back wing\\" was added, as well as the tingzi jian (亭子间) or \\"pergola room\\", located above the kitchen and below the terrace. This was typically small, with low ceilings, and faced north, making it the least attractive room in the house. They were usually used for storage, or as living quarters for servants. Numerous new type shikumen have survived. Some well known examples include Jianye Li (now revamped into an upmarket hotel, commercial and residential complex), Siming Cun, and Mingde Li located on Avenue Joffre. ==Names== In Chinese, shikumen developments are typically named with a suffix of Li (里, \\"neighbourhood\\"), Fang (坊, \\"ward\\"), Long (弄, \\"lane\\") or Cun (邨, \\"village\\"). The first two are traditional suffixes for names of urban precincts, in common use since at least the Tang Dynasty. Where an English name was used, \\"Terrace\\" was a common suffix. The first part of the name typically derives from one of three sources.区县志 >> 区志 >> 黄浦区志 >> 第十一编特色建筑 >> 第三章石库门房屋 >> 附：石库门里弄名称特色 上海地方志办公室. The first kind takes the name of the freeholder or related party: for example Siming Cun is named after the Chinese name (\\"Siming Bank\\") of the project's main sponsor, the Ningpo Commercial & Savings Bank; similarly, Meilan Fang takes one syllable from each of the two owners' names - brothers Wu Meixi and Wu Silan. The second kind takes the name of a nearby road or landmark, for example Bao'an Fang is named after the nearby Temple to the Bao'an Situ. The third type uses an auspicious words: such as Jixiang Li (\\"auspicious\\"), Ruyi Li (\\"happiness\\") and Ping'an Li (\\"safety\\"). The Chinese name for Cité Bourgogne, Bugao Li, is both phonetically similar to the French name and has an auspicious meaning of \\"stepping upwards\\". The names are typically inscribed, along with the year of construction, on the arch above the lane entrance. ==Notable shikumen neighbourhoods today== Xinxin Li under demolition An unreconstructed laneway in Shangxian Fang, with numerous shops Few old type shikumen neighbourhoods survive. Xingren Li, built in 1872, was regarded as a characteristic old type shikumen development. It was located on East Beijing Road, and composed of 24 two-storey residences, which varied in size between three-bay wide and five-bay wide styles. The main lane was 107.5 metres long, and the end walls featured Guanyin dou-style gables. It was demolished in 1980. Another notable now-demolished development was Siwen Li, located on Xinzha Road. This late period old type shikumen development occupied 4.66 hectares, with 48,000 square metres of floor space. There were a total of 706 residences of two or three storeys. Most of these buildings were one-bay wide, without modern sanitary equipment. The house gates were noted for intricate baroque style lintels. Originally a middle-class neighbourhood, the area became dense slums due to the influx of refugees in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The entire neighbourhood was razed progressively in 2012-2014. Cité Bourgogne (Bugao Li), located on South Shanxi Road, is a typical old type shikumen development despite being built in the 1930s. The neighbourhood includes 87 two-storey brick veneer residences with a red brick exterior. The trunk lane is about 2.5 wide, and there are numerous branch lanes. The lanes are noted for their main gateways, modeled after traditional Chinese pailou gates. Cité Bourgogne is well preserved in situ as a municipal heritage site, and remains mostly residential. The largest shikumen neighbourhood which survives in a mostly original state is Jianye Li (建业里), also heritage protected. A new type development located on West Jianguo Road and Yueyang Road, the development is composed of 260 residences, all of which are two storey red brick buildings. This development is noted for its use of traditionally Chinese matou gables, and arched doorways. In 2003, the original residents were relocated, and the buildings were somewhat controversially renovated to become serviced apartments and to house restaurants and other commercial uses. Shangxian Fang (尚贤坊), located on the site of the main hall of the International Institute of China of Gilbert Reid, is another heritage protected shikumen precinct, which is now being renovated to become \\"shikumen hotels\\". Other re-developed shikumen precincts include Xintiandi, where the buildings were extensively reconstructed, and Tianzi Fang, which has been redeveloped for small businesses with an artistic bent, while largely preserving the fabric of the buildings. All of these redevelopment projects have been controversial. Other than Cité Bourgogne, Shangxian Fang and Jianye Li, other heritage protected shikumen precincts are Siming Cun, Meilan Fang and Rongkang Li. ==GalleryDifferent types of end-wall gables=== File:A Type of Shikumen Gable in JixiangLi Shanghai.JPGJixiang Li File:A Type of Shikumen Gable in Cité Bourgogne Shanghai.JPGCité Bourgogne File:Gable of a Buling in Jianye Li.JPGJianye Li (matou style) File:A Type of Shikumen Gable in ZhangYuan Shanghai.JPGChang Garden File:The Wall with Decoration in Siming Cun Shanghai.JPGSiming Cun ===Different types of house gates=== File:The Door of a Shikumen Building in East Siwenli before demolished.JPGEast Siwen Li (demolished) File:A Shikumen Door in Cité Bourgogne.JPGCité Bourgogne File:A Shikumen Door in Siming Cun Shanghai.JPGSiming Cun File:A Type of Shikumen Gate in Shanghai.JPGA shikumen on Xinzha Road File:A Type of Shikumen Gate in a Lilong on Daming Ed..JPGA shikumen on Daming Road File:The Door of a Shikumen Building in Rongkangli.jpgRongkang Li File:A Type of Shikumen Gate in a Lilong on North Xiangyang Ed..JPGA shikumen on North Xiangyang Road File:Entrance of Provisional Government of ROK in Shanghai.JPGA shikumen on Madang Road ===Different types of lane entrances=== File:Shangxian Fang.JPGShangxian Fang File:Shanghai - Cité Bourgogne - 2.jpgCité Bourgogne File:CCP Xintiandi 2209.JPGShude Li File:The Entrance to East SiwenLi.JPGEast Siwen Li (demolished) File:Xinxinli.JPGXinxin Li File:XingshundongLi on Jiashan Rd..JPGXingshun East Li File:Entrance of a Shikumen Lilong on Shanhaiguan Rd..JPGA shikumen lane on Shanhaiguan Road ==See also== * Shikumen Open House Museum * Xintiandi * Tianzifang ==References== ==External links== *The Herbert Offen Research Collection of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum *Historic Shanghai Category:Architecture of China Category:Buildings and structures in Shanghai Category:History of Shanghai Category:Tourist attractions in Shanghai ","title":"Shikumen"},{"id":"514987","text":"The diplomonads (Greek for \\"two units\\") are a group of flagellates, most of which are parasitic. They include Giardia lamblia, which causes giardiasis in humans. They are placed among the metamonads, and appear to be particularly close relatives of the retortamonads. Most diplomonads are double cells: they have two nuclei, each with four associated flagella, arranged symmetrically about the body's main axis. Like the retortamonads, they lack both mitochondria and Golgi apparatuses. However, they are now known to possess modified mitochondria, in the case of G. lamblia, called mitosomes. These are not used in ATP synthesis the way mitochondria are, but are involved in the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins. ==Possible sexual reproduction in Giardia== The common intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis (synonyms Giardia lamblia, G. duodenalis) was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex. However, G. intestinalis has now been found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes. These results suggested that G. intestinalis is capable of meiosis and thus sexual reproduction. Furthermore, Cooper et al. found direct evidence in G. intestinalis for infrequent meiotic recombination, indicative of sexual reproduction between individuals. Lasek-Nesselquist et al. also detected molecular signatures consistent with meiotic sex. The possibility of sexual reproduction is still debated. G. intestinalis contains two functionally equivalent nuclei that are inherited independently during mitosis. In the giardial cyst these nuclei fuse (karyogamy) and undergo homologous recombination facilitated by meiosis gene homologs. The recombination associated with karyogamy may primarily function to repair DNA damage. G. intestinalis is divided into eight assemblages based on host specificities and genetic divergence of marker genes. Although recombination can occur infrequently within assemblages, Xu et al. found that recombination between individuals from different assemblages is very rare. They suggested that the assemblages are genetically isolated lineages, and thus could be viewed as separated Giardia species. == References == Category:Flagellates Category:Metamonads ","title":"Diplomonad"},{"id":"515018","text":"Thomas (Tom) Cavalier-Smith, FRS, FRSC, NERC Professorial Fellow (born 21 October 1942), is a Professor of Evolutionary Biology in the Department of Zoology, at the University of Oxford. His research has led to discovery of a number of unicellular organisms (protists) and definition of taxonomic positions, such as introduction of the kingdom Chromista, and other groups including Chromalveolata, Opisthokonta, Rhizaria, and Excavata. He is well known for his system of classification of all organisms. ==Life and career== Cavalier-Smith was born on 21 October 1942 in London. His parents were Alan Hailes Spencer and Mary Maude Cavalier-Smith. He was educated at Norwich School, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (MA) and King's College London (PhD). He was under the supervision of Sir John Randall for his PhD thesis between 1964 and 1967; his thesis was entitled \\"Organelle Development in Chlamydomonas reinhardii\\". From 1967 to 1969, he was a guest investigator at Rockefeller University. He became Lecturer of biophysics at King's College London in 1969. He was promoted to Reader in 1982. In 1989 he was appointed Professor of botany at the University of British Columbia. In 1999, he joined the University of Oxford, becoming Professor of evolutionary biology in 2000. ==Awards and honours== Cavalier-Smith was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (FLS) in 1980, the Institute of Biology (FIBiol) in 1983, the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in 1987, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in 1988, the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in 1997, and the Royal Society of London in 1998. He received the International Prize for Biology from the Emperor of Japan in 2004, and the Linnean Medal for Zoology in 2007. He was appointed Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) between 1998 and 2007, and Advisor of the Integrated Microbial Biodiversity of CIFAR. He won the 2007 Frink Medal of the Zoological Society of London. ==Contributions== Tree of life and major steps in cell evolution after Cavalier-Smith, ca 2010, before his 2015 revision Cavalier- Smith has written extensively on the taxonomy and classification of protists. One of his major contributions to biology was his proposal of a new kingdom of life: the Chromista. He also introduced a new group for primitive eukaryotes called the Chromalveolata (1981), as well as Opisthokonta (1987), Rhizaria (2002), and Excavata (2002). Though fairly well known, many of his claims have been controversial and have not gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community to date. His taxonomic revisions often lead to changes in the overall classification of all life forms. ===Eight kingdoms model=== Cavalier- Smith's first major classification system was the division of all organisms into eight kingdoms. In 1981, he proposed that by completely revising Robert Whittaker's Five Kingdom system, there could be eight kingdoms: Bacteria, Eufungi, Ciliofungi, Animalia, Biliphyta, Viridiplantae, Cryptophyta, and Euglenozoa. In 1993, he revised his system particularly in the light of the general acceptance of Archaebacteria as separate group from Bacteria. In addition, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered. As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom Archezoa. This was known as the Archezoa hypothesis. The eight kingdoms became: Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Archezoa, Protozoa, Chromista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. However, kingdom Archezoa is now defunct. He now assigns former members of the kingdom Archezoa to the phylum Amoebozoa. ===Six kingdoms models=== By 1998, Cavalier-Smith had reduced the total number of kingdoms from eight to six: Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae (including Glaucophyte, red and green algae), Chromista and Bacteria. Nevertheless, he had already presented this simplified scheme for the first time on his 1981 paper and endorsed it in 1983.Cavalier-Smith T (1983) A 6-kingdom classification and a unified phylogeny. In: Schenk HEA, Schwemmler WS, editors. Endocytobiology II: intracellular space as oligogenetic. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter & Co. pp. 1027–1034 Table 11 From Eukaryote kingdoms: seven or nine? Five of Cavalier-Smith's kingdoms are classified as eukaryotes as shown in the following scheme: *Eubacteria *Neomura **Archaebacteria **Eukaryotes ***Kingdom Protozoa *** Unikonts (heterotrophs) ****Kingdom Animalia ****Kingdom Fungi *** Bikonts (primarily photosynthetic) ****Kingdom Plantae (including red and green algae) ****Kingdom Chromista The kingdom Animalia was divided into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa, and Bilateria (all other animal phyla). He created three new animal phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, and gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids), and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tardigrades) and recognised a total of 23 animal phyla. Cavalier-Smith's 2003 classification scheme: * Unikonts ** protozoan phylum Amoebozoa (ancestrally uniciliate) ** opisthokonts *** uniciliate protozoan phylum Choanozoa *** kingdom Fungi *** kingdom Animalia * Bikonts ** protozoan infrakingdom Rhizaria *** phylum Cercozoa *** phylum Retaria (Radiozoa and Foraminifera) ** protozoan infrakingdom Excavata *** phylum Loukozoa *** phylum Metamonada *** phylum Euglenozoa *** phylum Percolozoa ** protozoan phylum Apusozoa (Thecomonadea and Diphylleida) ** the chromalveolate clade *** kingdom Chromista (Cryptista, Heterokonta, and Haptophyta) *** protozoan infrakingdom Alveolata **** phylum Ciliophora **** phylum Miozoa (Protalveolata, Dinozoa, and Apicomplexa) ** kingdom Plantae (Viridaeplantae, Rhodophyta and Glaucophyta) ===Seven kingdoms model=== Cavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised the classification in 2015, and published it in PLOS ONE. In this scheme they reintroduced the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms, Bacteria (=Eubacteria) and Archaea (=Archebacteria). This is based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) and the Catalogue of Life. ===Rooting the tree of life === In 2006, Cavalier-Smith proposed that the last universal common ancestor to all life was a non-flagellate negibacterium with two membranes. == References == == External links == * University of Oxford Faculty Web Page for T.

Métal hurlant (literal translation: \\"Howling Metal\\")https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/M%C3%A9tal%20hurlant was a French comics anthology of science fiction and horror comics stories, created in December 1974 by comics artists Jean Giraud (better known as Mœbius) and Philippe Druillet together with journalist-writer Jean-Pierre Dionnet and financial director Bernard Farkas. The four were collectively known as \\"Les Humanoïdes Associés\\" (United Humanoids), which became the name of the publishing house releasing Métal hurlant. It was published in the United States by National Lampoon under the title Heavy Metal. It was published in Germany under the title '. ==Overview== The magazine was originally released quarterly; it consisted of 68 pages, of which only 16 were in colour. Contributors included Moebius and Druillet, depicting such characters as Arzach and Lone Sloane. Later issues featured Richard Corben, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Enki Bilal, Caza, Serge Clerc, Alain Voss, Berni Wrightson, Nicole Claveloux, Milo Manara, Frank Margerin, Masse, Chantal Montellier, and many others. It became bi-monthly with No. 7 and monthly with No. 9. Apart from comics, the magazine contained articles about science fiction books and movies, as well as music and videogame reviews. Métal hurlant, emphasising complex graphics, cinematic imagery and surreal storylines, was highly influential throughout the world as one of the first mature expressions of \\"adult\\" comic book making. It ceased publication in July 1987. Métal hurlant began publishing again in July 2002 by Humanoids Publishing, with a French, English, Spanish and Portuguese version, under the French name. As a \\"two- headed\\", transatlantic (France-US) magazine, led by Fabrice Giger in Los Angeles, it published original short stories, sometimes related to existing or to be published comic books. Its aim was to discover young creators and promote the products from the publisher. This incarnation of the magazine ceased publication with issue No. 14, dated November/December 2004. In May 2020, Vincent Bernière announces the return of Metal Hurlant for 2021. ==Stories== Stories that were published in Métal hurlant include: *Arzach *Exterminator 17 *Fragile by Stefano Raffaele *Jeremiah *Lone Sloane *Milady 3000 *The Zombies That Ate the World by Guy Davis and Jerry Frissen *The Long Tomorrow by Dan O'Bannon and Jean Giraud *1996 by Chantal Montellier ==Adaptations== Some of their titles have gone on to be adapted into other media. In November 2009, Hicham Benkirane announced that a film based on Stefano Raffaele's Fragile is in development. In October 2011, it was announced that a live-action TV series based on Métal hurlant titled Métal Hurlant Chronicles went into production in France. A French-United Kingdom co- production, the series consists of 12 half-hour episodes to be shown over two seasons. Featured actors include Rutger Hauer, Scott Adkins, Michael Jai White, Karl E. Landler, Joe Flanigan, David Belle, Matt Mullins and James Marsters. In the United States, the series began airing on the Syfy Channel on 14 April 2014. ==Notes== ==References== * Métal Hurlant at BDoubliées * Métal Hurlant at Bedetheque * Métal Hurlant (Hors Série) at Bedetheque * * * ==External links== * Metal Hurlant at Humanoids Publishing * 2002+ checklist Category:1974 establishments in France Category:Adult comics Category:Comics magazines published in France Category:French science fiction Category:Magazines established in 1974 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1987 Category:Magazines reestablished in 2002 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2004 Category:1974 comics debuts Category:1987 comics endings Category:2002 comics debuts Category:2004 comics endings Category:Defunct magazines published in France Category:Defunct comics Category:Magazines about comics Category:Comics adapted into television series Category:Monthly magazines published in France Category:French-language magazines ","title":"Métal hurlant"},{"id":"515030","text":"Lundu documented by Von Martius in Brazil, 1817-1820. . Lundu (also spelled landu or landum) is a style of Afro-Brazilian music and dance with its origins in the African Bantu and Portuguese people. ==History== The interconnectedness of Lusophone countries dates back to the Atlantic Slave Trade, between Portugal, Brazil and regions of Africa. In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the primary exporters of African slaves to the Americas, and with slaves came their musical traditions. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a massive Brazilian presence in Angola, enabling a cultural exchange between the two Portuguese colonies. This exchange enabled subtle amalgamations of musical styles between Angola, Brazil and other African slave trade countries. The establishment of a creole population in Brazil led to further cultural developments in language, religion and art. ==Dissemination== Records from the inquisition of the 18th century reveal that the Europeans initially considered gandus and lundus to be witchcraft. Many slave-owning Europeans in Brazil tolerated the dance in an attempt to avoid slave rebellion. Eventually, the style became attractive to Europeans in Brazil for its sexualized quality and its believed effectiveness in reversing witchcraft. de Mattos was disgruntled by the blurring by dance and drums of strict racial and cultural boundaries in Brazil. Gradually, the lundu style grew in popularity among the elite population in Brazil. In 1749, Brazilian musician Manuel de Almeida Botelho immigrated to Lisbon, bringing with him the modinha and lundu musical styles. By the 19th century, lundu had become the music of choice for the Luso-Brazilian bourgeoisie. Historians have even called the style the “…most characteristic late 18th century [genre] of dance and song in Portugal and Brazil”. A Lundu performance in the 18th century, as depicted in a print from artist Rugendas ==Style== Lundus are characterized by varying structure, the interplay of tonic and dominant harmony, and strummed chords layered atop a syncopated rhythm reminiscent of traditional West African music. Limited recordings are available of traditional lundus style. Usually a flirtatious ritual of a couple dance, accompanied by a guitar, or sometimes a thumb piano or drums, Lundu is related to the Spanish fandango and other new-world dances like the Argentine Zamba, the Peruvian Zamacueca and the Cuban Bolero - they all involve, to some degree, handkerchiefs, castanets, and holding one's arms above one's head. In the 19th century, the lundu was one of the sources of the Choro, the Maxixe and the Samba ==References== Category:Brazilian styles of music Category:Brazilian dances ","title":"Lundu (dance)"},{"id":"515036","text":"Robert Rutherford Beatty (19 October 1909 – 3 March 1992) was a Canadian actor who worked in film, television and radio for most of his career and was especially known in the UK. ==Early years== Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Beatty was the son of Charles Thompson Beatty and Blanch Sarah Rutherford.

It is found in Venezuela and north-central Brazil. Until 1983, all the owl monkeys were regarded as subspecies of Aotus trivirgatus, and all were referred to as douroucoulis. The use of the name douroucouli exclusively for the three-striped night monkey is not universally accepted; some authors use it for the entire genus, or for the grey-necked group of species within it (to which A. trivirgatus belongs). Like other owl monkeys, the three-striped night monkey lives in woodlands including rain forest. It is mainly black, with striking white markings on its face. Its body size is 27–48 cm, and its tail is about the same length again. Adults weigh up to 1 kg. It has very large eyes, and is most active on moonlit nights, feeding on fruit, nuts, leaves, insects and other small invertebrates, and birds' eggs. The three-striped night monkey forms pair bonds which are broken only by the death of one partner. It lives in family groups, with the immature young staying with their parents until sexual maturity at the age of 3 or 4. Normally only one infant is born, after a gestation period of a little over 4 months. == References == three-striped night monkey Category:Mammals of Venezuela Category:Mammals of Brazil three-striped night monkey ","title":"Three-striped night monkey"},{"id":"515046","text":"Pushbutton and touch screen Deutsche Bahn ticket machines in Hinterzarten, Germany A ticket machine, also known as a ticket vending machine (TVM), is a vending machine that produces paper or electronic tickets, or recharges a stored-value card or smart card or the user's mobile wallet, typically on a smartphone. For instance, ticket machines dispense train tickets at railway stations, transit tickets at metro stations and tram tickets at some tram stops and in some trams. Token machines may dispense the ticket in the form of a token which has the same function as a paper or electronic ticket. The typical transaction consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a payment method of either cash, credit/debit card or smartcard. The ticket(s) are then printed on paper and dispensed to the user, or loaded onto the user's smartcard or smartphone. ==Ticket and fare formats== For most of the twentieth century, ticket machines issued paper tickets, or tokens worth one fare each. Later, fare value was loaded onto stored-value cards (first paper, later smart cards). Passengers could load any amount within a range; it did not necessarily have to correspond to any particular single fare. The cards could be reloaded until their expiration date, again with any monetary amount within a given range. To encourage usage of ticket machines and reduce the need for salespersons, machine prices may in some cases be lower than those at a ticket counter. ==Timeline== *1904: first self-service ticket machines on the Central London Railway, now part of London UndergroundM.

Their functions may include printing tickets, recording of sales and payments. Some manufacturers are TIM, Almex, Setright, AEG, CAMP (Compagnie d'Ateliers Mecaniques de Precision), Gibson GFI Genfare, Parkeon, Xerox, Beckson and Corvia (Ticketer). Since the 1970s (jobs), electronic computer terminals and printers are used. Handheld ticket machines are used on buses in India to sell tickets, validate smart cards and renew passes. These machines replaced the earlier manual fare collection system where tickets were often punched to indicate journey and fare stages. ==Enforcement== In many countries where trains and urban transport tickets operate largely on the honor system (with enforcement by roving inspectors or conductors), there are also machines in stations (or in vehicles) for validating tickets. This is for the situation where one buys a ticket in advance and decides to use it later. Usually, the ticket is time-stamped to determine its validity period. A common problem is forgetting to validate and then being fined as if one had no ticket at all. Such machines are generally not used in the United States. Nearly all American mass transit networks operating on the honor system expect their users to buy tickets immediately before use; regular riders can avoid that inconvenience by buying period passes in advance (often from the same machines that sell daily or one-time tickets). Recently, however, a handful of regional rail systems like Metrolink have adopted the use of validation machines for at least some ticket types. ==Issues== Ticket machines that are out of service or accept 'exact change only' result in losses for transport providers. Ticket machines on trams in Melbourne, for example, often run out of change when passengers use a higher ratio of $2 and 50c coins, depleting the ticket machine of smaller coin denominations (10c, 20c).

It is the largest endorheic basin in Australia and amongst the largest in the world, covering about , including much of inland Queensland, large portions of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and a part of western New South Wales. The basin is also one of the largest, least-developed arid zone basins with a high degree of variability anywhere. It supports about 60,000 people and a large amount of wildlife, and has no major irrigation, diversions or flood-plain developments. Low density grazing is the major land use, occupying 82% of the total land within the basin. The basin began as a sinking landmass mostly covered by forest and contained many more lakes than now. The climate has changed from wet to arid over the last 60 million years. Most of the rivers in the Lake Eyre basin are now slow flowing, flat and completely dry for lengthy periods. When the country north of the basin floods, floodwaters drain via the main rivers of the basin, Cooper Creek, Georgina River and Diamantina River southwards towards Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, the country's lowest point at below sea level. The water overflows the river banks, across the floodplains, filling waterholes and wetlands and carving new channels, giving rise to the name Channel Country. Most of the rain which falls in the north never reaches the lake 1,000 km away, which only fills occasionally. Management of the area has been problematic as it is covered by four different states' jurisdictions. As the ecological significance of the basin has become known and mismanagement of the Murray- Darling Basin became apparent during several drought cycles, it became clear that ongoing management issues had to be resolved. In 2001 the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was signed, and the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was set up to ensure the sustainability of the Lake Eyre Basin river systems. In 2014, the Queensland Government changed the laws protecting the rivers and floodplains, which, according to environmentalists, could lead to shale gas mining or fracking in the area. ==Geology== Lake Eyre in 1990, as seen by STS-35 The basin began to form in the early Paleogene (about 60 million years ago) when south-eastern South Australia started to sink and rivers began to deposit sediment into the large, shallow basin. A remnant of an old oceanic plate is currently sinking in the mantle beneath the basin. The suction effect of this sinking likely caused both the Lake Eyre Basin as well as the Murray-Darling basin to form. The basin is still gradually sinking, and still gradually accumulating sediment.Sprigg, R.C. (1991): Geological Summary in: A natural history of the Lake Eyre Region. The South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service's Northern Consultative Committee. State Print, Adelaide. For many millions of years, the Lake Eyre Basin was well supplied with water and largely forested. About 20 million years ago, large shallow lakes formed, covering much of the area for about 10 million years. From that time on, as Australia drifted further north and the climate became gradually more arid, the lakes and floodplains started to dry. Only in the last 2.6 million years did the onset of the ice ages bring about the present climatic regime and the consequent fairly rapid desertification of the area. The basin covers just under one- sixth of all Australia and is the largest endorheic basin in Australia and amongst the largest in the world, covering about ,Map of the Lake Eyre basin including much of inland Queensland, large portions of South Australia and the Northern Territory, and a part of western New South Wales.Lake Eyre Basin . Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The basin is also one of the largest, least-developed arid zone basins with a high degree of variability anywhere. It supports about 60,000 people and a large amount of wildlife, and has no major irrigation, diversions or flood-plain developments. Low density grazing is the major land use, occupying 82% of the total land within the basin. Significant minerals deposits such as oil and natural gas, including Australia's most significant onshore petroleum reserves, are found within the basin. The mining and petroleum industries account for the greatest economic activity in the Lake Eyre Basin. Opals, coal, phosphate, gypsum and uranium are also mined from the basin. In 2009, the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that heavy metals from mining operations near Mount Isa had entered the upper reaches of the Georgina River. The spill has the potential to contaminate parts of the basin as far south as Lake Eyre. == Geography == Strzelecki Desert, South Australia During years of especially high rainfall, all the riverbeds in this vast, mostly flat, arid and semi-arid area lead inland (not towards the sea) towards Lake Eyre in central South Australia. Lake Eyre itself lies approximately below sea level, and usually contains only salt. In flood years, it fills and, for a short time, undergoes a period of rapid growth and fertility: long-dormant marine creatures multiply and large flocks of waterfowl arrive to feed and raise their young before the waters evaporate once more. The annual mean runoff in the Lake Eyre Basin is lowest of any of the world's major drainage basins. None of the creeks and rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin are permanent: they flow only after heavy rain – a rare to very rare event in the arid interior of Australia. Average annual rainfall in the area surrounding Lake Eyre is , and the pan evaporation rate is . Annualised average figures are misleading: since 1885 annual rainfall over the of the Lake Eyre Basin has ranged from about in 1928 to over in 1974. Most of the water reaching Lake Eyre comes from the river systems of semi-arid inland Queensland, roughly to the north. To provide a sense of scale, the Lake Eyre Basin is about the size of France, Germany and Italy combined. It is slightly larger than the Murray-Darling basin (which drains inland eastern Australia and is responsible for a large proportion of the continent's agricultural productivity) but has vastly less water. Nevertheless, the entire flow of the Murray-Darling would be insufficient to fill Lake Eyre, merely keeping pace with evaporation. In contrast, the flow of the Mississippi could fill Lake Eyre in 22 days, that of the Amazon in just 3 days. Other lakes in the basin include Lake Frome, Lake Yamma Yamma and Lake Hart. === Rivers === The Cooper Creek, Finke River, Georgina River and Diamantina River are the four main rivers of the basin. Other desert rivers include the Hale River, Plenty River and Todd River that flow from the south east of the Northern Territory, south. In the western parts of the basin the Neales River and Macumba River flow into Lake Eyre. Rivers within the basin have a low gradient, slow flow rate and a naturally turbid water quality. Several of the major Lake Eyre Basin river systems are well-known. Because the Lake Eyre Basin is almost flat, rivers flow slowly and frequently split up into floodplains or multiple braided channels. Water is lost to evaporation, to seepage, and in the many ephemeral wetland systems, with the result that downstream flows are typically smaller than upstream flows. Only in exceptional years is there sufficient upstream rain to provide a flow into Lake Eyre itself. The Finke River, starting roughly west of Alice Springs is thought to be the oldest riverbed in the world and although it flows for only a few days a year (in many years it does not flow at all) is home to seven species of fish, two of which are found nowhere else. The waters of the Finke disappear into the sands of the Simpson Desert and are not definitely known to ever make it as far south as Lake Eyre, although the story is told that this happened once early in the 20th century. In extreme events, water from the Finke River flows into the Macumba River, which empties into Lake Eyre, a total distance from headwater streams of around . Major tributaries include Ellery Creek, and the Palmer and Hugh Rivers. The Georgina River system originates on the Barkly Tableland, near the Northern Territory-Queensland border, north-west of Mount Isa and not far south of the Gulf of Carpentaria. In this relatively humid northern area, rainfall can be as high as per year and evaporation as low as . The Georgina flows through innumerable channels leading south through far-western Queensland for over , eventually reaching Goyder Lagoon in the north-eastern corner of South Australia. Australia's early bush poets immortalised the Diamantina River, making it a symbol of the remote outback. It too rises in northern Queensland, roughly between Mount Isa and Winton, flowing 800 kilometres south and west through Birdsville and the Channel Country to join the Georgina at Goyder Lagoon (and then, if there is sufficient flow, down Warburton Creek towards Lake Eyre). Of all the Lake Eyre Basin river systems, however, Cooper Creek is by far the most famous, in particular because it was along Cooper Creek that the explorers Burke and Wills met their deaths. It rises in the form of two central Queensland rivers, the Thomson between Longreach and Charters Towers, and the Barcoo in the area around Barcaldine, about inland from Rockhampton. Cooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of meandering ephemeral channels, making its way roughly south into the far south-west corner of Queensland before turning due west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre. It takes almost a year for water to reach Lake Eyre from the headwaters. In most years, none does: it is absorbed into the earth, goes to fill channels and the many permanent waterholes, or simply evaporates. Water from Cooper Creek reached Lake Eyre in 1990 and then not again until 2010. === Deserts === The deserts that have formed in the basin, including Sturt Stony Desert, Tirari Desert and the Strzelecki Desert, are most probably the southern hemisphere's largest source of airborne dust. ==History== Wangkangurru (also known as Arabana/Wangkangurru, Wangganguru, Wanggangurru, Wongkangurru) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Wangkangurru country. It is closely related to Arabana language of South Australia. The Wangkangurru language region was traditionally in the South Australian-Queensland border region taking in Birdsville and extending south towards Innamincka and Lake Eyre, including the local government areas of the Shire of Diamantina as well as the Outback Communities Authority of South Australia. ==Management== Indigenous Australians have lived with the cycles of the land for thousands of years and traditional owners are protective of its natural systems. Management of the area has been problematic as it is covered by four different states' jurisdictions. As the ecological significance of the basin has become known and mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin became apparent during several drought cycles, it became clear that ongoing management issues had to be resolved. In 2001 the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was signed, and the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement was set up to ensure the sustainability of the Lake Eyre Basin river systems, particularly to avoid or eliminate cross-border impacts. The Lake Eyre Basin Ministerial Forum was established as the decision making body responsible for overseeing of the Agreement. The Ministerial Forum created a Community Advisory Committee to provide advice and facilitate community participation and a Scientific Advisory Panel to advise on scientific and technical issues. On 7 September 2018 the Lake Eyre Basin Ministerial Forum agreed to release the second review of the agreement. In 2014, the Queensland Government changed the laws protecting the rivers and floodplains, which, according to environmentalists, could lead to shale gas mining or fracking in the area. ===Protected areas=== The Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park, Strzelecki Regional Reserve, Witjira National Park, Sturt National Park, Diamantina National Park, and Simpson Desert National Park are among a number of protected areas established within the Lake Eyre Basin. ===River diversion schemes=== The Bradfield Scheme was an ambitious proposal by Dr John Bradfield in 1938. It would use large pipes, tunnels, pumps and dams to divert water from the monsoon-fed Tully, Herbert and Burdekin rivers into the Thomson River, Queensland. Other less-developed diversion schemes have been proposed to divert river or sea water into the Lake Eyre Basin from time to time. ==Fauna== A total of 27 individual species of fish are found in Lake Eyre basin, 13 of them are endemic. The largest fish species is the Macquaria, reaching a maximum weight of about . ==References== ==Further reading/viewing== *Lakeeyrebasin.gov.au: Report on the hydrology of the Lake Eyre Basin * *Dr Vincent Kotwicki: Floods of Lake Eyre - an interesting site with much data, including Lake Eyre inflows 1885–2012. * Category:Drainage basins of Australia Category:Landforms of New South Wales Category:Landforms of the Northern Territory Category:Landforms of Queensland Category:Landforms of South Australia Category:Regions of the Northern Territory Category:Regions of New South Wales Category:Regions of Queensland Category:Regions of South Australia ","title":"Lake Eyre basin"},{"id":"515055","text":"The Man-eaters of Tsavo is a book written by John Henry Patterson in 1907 that recounts his experiences while overseeing the construction of a railroad bridge in what would become Kenya. It is titled after a pair of lions which killed his workers, and which he eventually killed. ==Overview== Following the death of the lions, the book tells of the bridge's completion in spite of additional challenges (such as a fierce flood) as well as many stories concerning local wildlife (including other lions) local tribes, the discovery of the maneaters' cave and various hunting expeditions. An appendix contains advice to sportsmen visiting British East Africa. The book also includes photographs taken by Patterson at the time which include the railway construction; the workers; local tribes; scenery and wildlife; and the man- eaters. Several publications about and studies of the man-eating lions of Tsavo have been inspired by Patterson's account. The book has been adapted to film three times: a monochrome, British film of the 1950s, a 1952 3-D film titled Bwana Devil, and a 1996 color version called The Ghost and the Darkness, where Val Kilmer played the daring engineer who hunts down the lions of Tsavo. ==Historicity of the account of the man-eaters== The Victorian style of the prose may appear today as overwritten; however, the editor's note to the 1986 reprint claims that the facts suggest that some aspects were actually downplayed, such as the death of Haslem, about which more grisly facts are known.Patterson, J.H., The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, 1986, New York: St. Martin's Press, , editor's note to the reprint edition. The book describes attacks by two man-eating lions on workers building the Uganda Railway through British East Africa in 1898 and how the pair were eventually killed by Patterson. It was remarkable that 135 people were killed by the man-eaters in less than a year before Patterson managed to kill them (although this number is contested, it is not disproven). Patterson's 1907 book itself states that \\"between them [the lions] no less than 28 Indian coolies, in addition to scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was kept\\" were killed. Later accounts exaggerated this number: 135 'Indian and African artisans and labourers' (Patterson, 1925), '135 armed men' (Patterson & Neiburger, 2000) and 140 (Caputo, 2000). In 2001, Julian Kerbis Peterhans and Tom Gnoske published their definitive paper on man-eating behavior among lions with special reference to the Tsavo situation. They documented between 28 and 31 victims. This lesser number was confirmed in Dr. Bruce Patterson's definitive book The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man- Eaters. He showed that the greater toll attributed to the lions resulted from a pamphlet written by Colonel Patterson in 1925, stating \\"these two ferocious brutes killed and devoured, under the most appalling circumstances, 135 Indian and African artisans and laborers employed in the construction of the Uganda Railway.\\"The man-eating lions of Tsavo. Zoology: Leaflet 7, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago The skins of the lions may be found at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. ==Setting== The book is set in East Africa. The nearest large city to the man-eater attacks is Mombasa, the largest city then and second largest city now in Kenya. The Tsavo man-eater attacks occurred while working on the Uganda Railway. The railway reached Lake Victoria at Port Florence, now Kisumu, which at that time was in Uganda territory. It was separate from railway developments elsewhere in East Africa, for instance in German-run Tanganyika. The railway project was controversial and the British Press referred to it as \\"The Lunatic Express\\", as critics considered it a waste of funds, while supporters argued it was necessary for transportation of goods. ==Plot== Colonel John Patterson is to build a bridge in East Africa (later Kenya). While he is working on this, two man-eating lions show up. They will stop at nothing for a bite of human flesh and the first attempts to stalk, capture or keep them out of the camp fail. They attack the camp hospital and kill a patient. Even after the hospital is moved, one lion penetrates the thick, thorn fence called a boma built to protect it and drags the water carrier away to his death. In the course of hunting these lions, Patterson encounters a red spitting cobra, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a pack of wild dogs, a wildebeest that faked dying, and a herd of zebra, of which he captured six. He also shoots a new type of antelope, T. oryx pattersonianus. Eventually, the first lion is defeated by baiting it with a tethered donkey while Patterson keeps watch from an elevated stand – though for a few tense moments Patterson himself becomes the hunted. Patterson and Mahina hunt the second lion on the plains. When they find and shoot it, the lion charges them and it takes repeated shots to bring it down. The lions are not the only challenge to completing the bridge project. Tensions between native workers and Sikhs brought in from British East India to work on the project (coolies) threaten to stop the project. At one point, Patterson meets a danger far greater than the lions – a fierce flood. It wipes out the supply bridges and wraps iron girders around tree trunks like wire. Uprooted tree trunks act like battering rams trying to annihilate the bridge. But the well- built bridge stays intact. This challenge proves that the year spent working on the bridge has not been wasted. After Patterson completes the bridge, he learns that a lion has been trying to destroy the train station. When he goes to see, he finds big bloodstains where the lion was trying to slash the roof. There were three men in one compartment and an uncertain number of coolies in another. Two of the men had been sleeping on the floor when the lion gained entrance. The lion was on one of the men while trying to attack another. The third man, in an effort to get to the other section, which the coolies had been holding shut with their turbans, leapt onto the lion's back, and tried desperately to get through. The coolies opened the door just wide enough for him to get through, and then tied it shut again. As for the other men, one got carried off and eaten by the lion, while the other man lay very still, probably saving his own life. Hearing this, Patterson decides to go after this lion, eventually finding it and slaughtering it. Another close encounter with a lion occurs when a lion is aboard a gharri, a means of transportation in Kenya similar to a small trolley. Another time, on the way back to the train station, Patterson converses with a friend who has never shot a lion. A couple of hundred yards away, Patterson points out a pair of lions and encourages the friend to shoot them. One runs off at the first shot, but he successfully bags the other lion. The end of the book includes a photo of the lion that the friend killed. When the time comes for Patterson to leave, some of the coolies and the natives want to go with him. However, Patterson knows that they do not have the immune defense system to combat the diseases outside of Africa. So he politely says no and leaves Africa for some years. (He later returns to Africa, but this part of his life is not recorded in this book.) ==CharactersThe lions=== *Man Eater 1 (\\"The Ghost\\") is long, and high. *Man Eater 2 (\\"The Darkness\\") is long and high. ===Cast=== John Patterson is the author and main character in the book.

Symptoms depend on the site of nerve damage and can include motor changes such as weakness; sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or pain; or autonomic changes such as urinary symptoms. These changes are thought to result from microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum). Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include distal symmetric polyneuropathy; third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsy; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; and autonomic neuropathy. ==Signs and symptoms== Illustration depicting areas affected by diabetic neuropathy Diabetic neuropathy can affect any peripheral nerves including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, diabetic neuropathy has the potential to affect essentially any organ system and can cause a range of symptoms. There are several distinct syndromes based on the organ systems affected. ===Sensorimotor polyneuropathy=== Longer nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length. In this syndrome, decreased sensation and loss of reflexes occurs first in the toes on each foot, then extends upward. It is usually described as a glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, dysesthesia and night time pain. The pain can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull. A pins and needles sensation is common. Loss of proprioception, the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. These patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are developing a callus from an ill-fitting shoe. Consequently, they are at risk of developing ulcers and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to amputation. Similarly, these patients can get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint. Loss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, contractures of the toes, loss of the interosseous muscle function that leads to contraction of the digits, so-called hammer toes. These contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand where the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal. The loss of muscular function is progressive. ===Autonomic neuropathy=== The autonomic nervous system is composed of nerves serving the heart, lungs, blood vessels, bone, adipose tissue, sweat glands, gastrointestinal system and genitourinary system. Autonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems. One commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetics is orthostatic hypotension, or becoming dizzy and possibly fainting when standing up due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. In the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, it is due to the failure of the heart and arteries to appropriately adjust heart rate and vascular tone to keep blood continually and fully flowing to the brain. This symptom is usually accompanied by a loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia – the usual change in heart rate seen with normal breathing. These two findings suggest autonomic neuropathy. Gastrointestinal manifestations include gastroparesis, nausea, bloating, and diarrhea. Because many diabetics take oral medication for their diabetes, absorption of these medicines is greatly affected by the delayed gastric emptying. This can lead to hypoglycemia when an oral diabetic agent is taken before a meal and does not get absorbed until hours, or sometimes days later when there is normal or low blood sugar already. Sluggish movement of the small intestine can cause bacterial overgrowth, made worse by the presence of hyperglycemia. This leads to bloating, gas and diarrhea. Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and retention. Again, because of the retention of urine, urinary tract infections are frequent. Urinary retention can lead to bladder diverticula, kidney stones, and reflux nephropathy. ===Cranial neuropathy=== When cranial nerves are affected, neuropathies of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve #3 or CNIII) are most common. The oculomotor nerve controls all the muscles that move the eye except for the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles. It also serves to constrict the pupil and open the eyelid. The onset of a diabetic third nerve palsy is usually abrupt, beginning with frontal or pain around the eye and then double vision. All the oculomotor muscles innervated by the third nerve may be affected, but those that control pupil size are usually well-preserved early on. This is because the parasympathetic nerve fibers within CNIII that influence pupillary size are found on the periphery of the nerve (in terms of a cross-sectional view), which makes them less susceptible to ischemic damage (as they are closer to the vascular supply). The sixth nerve, the abducens nerve, which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye (moves the eye laterally), is also commonly affected but fourth nerve, the trochlear nerve, (innervates the superior oblique muscle, which moves the eye downward) involvement is unusual. Damage to a specific nerve of the thoracic or lumbar spinal nerves can occur and may lead to painful syndromes that mimic a heart attack, gallbladder inflammation, or appendicitis. Diabetics have a higher incidence of entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. ==Pathogenesis== The following processes are thought to be involved in the development of diabetic neuropathy: ===Microvascular disease=== Vascular and neural diseases are closely related. Blood vessels depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depend on adequate blood flow. The first pathological change in the small blood vessels is narrowing of the blood vessels. As the disease progresses, neuronal dysfunction correlates closely with the development of blood vessel abnormalities, such as capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished oxygen tension and hypoxia. Neuronal ischemia is a well-established characteristic of diabetic neuropathy. Blood vessel opening agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors, α1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow, with corresponding improvements in nerve conduction velocities. Thus, small blood vessel dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy. ===Advanced glycated end products=== Elevated levels of glucose within cells cause a non- enzymatic covalent bonding with proteins, which alters their structure and inhibits their function. Some of these glycated proteins have been implicated in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy and other long-term complications of diabetes. ===Polyol pathway=== Also called the sorbitol/aldose reductase pathway, the polyol pathway appears to be implicated in diabetic complications, especially in microvascular damage to the retina, kidney, and nerves. ==Diagnosis== Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be diagnosed with a history and physical examination. The diagnosis is considered in people who develop pain or numbness in a leg or foot with a history of diabetes. Physical exam findings may include changes in appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and diminished ankle reflexes, the most useful physical examination findings for large fiber neuropathy are an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely. Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition. === Classification === Diabetic neuropathy encompasses a series of different neuropathic syndromes which can be categorized as follows: * Focal and multifocal neuropathies: ** Mononeuropathy which affects one nerve ** Amyotrophy or radiculopathy such as proximal diabetic neuropathy, affecting a specific pattern of nerves ** Multiple lesions, affecting nerves that don't follow a specific pattern, also called \\"mononeuritis multiplex\\" ** Nerve damage from entrapment (e.g. median, ulnar, peroneal) * Symmetrical neuropathies: ** Sensory ** Autonomic ** Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN), the diabetic type of which is also known as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) (most common presentation) ==Prevention== Diabetic neuropathy can be largely prevented by maintaining blood glucose levels and lifestyle modifications. Enhanced glucose control methods include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral antidiabetic agents, while lifestyle modifications may include exercise alone, or in combination with dietary modifications. Enhanced glucose control prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve abnormalities in type 1 diabetes, and delays the onset of neuropathy in both types of diabetes. However, such methods may increase the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event, and many of these more aggressive methods require more frequent insulin use which has been associated with excessive risk of falls. ==TreatmentBlood glucose management=== Treatment of early manifestations of sensorimotor polyneuropathy involves improving glycemic control. Tight control of blood glucose can reverse the changes of diabetic neuropathy if the neuropathy and diabetes are recent in onset. This is the primary treatment of diabetic neuropathy that may change the course of the condition as the other treatments focus on reducing pain and other symptoms. ===Topical agents=== Capsaicin applied to the skin in a 0.075% concentration has not been found to be more effective than placebo for treating pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions for more concentrated forms of capsaicin, clonidine, or lidocaine applied to the skin. About 10% of people who use capsaicin cream have a large benefit. === Medications === Medication options for pain control include antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A systematic review concluded that \\"tricyclic antidepressants and traditional anticonvulsants are better for short term pain relief than newer generation anticonvulsants.\\" A further analysis of previous studies showed that the agents carbamazepine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, and amitriptyline were more effective than placebo, but that comparative effectiveness between each agent is unclear. The only three medications approved by the United States' Food and Drug Administration for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) are the antidepressant duloxetine, the anticonvulsant pregabalin, and the long-acting opioid tapentadol ER (extended release). Before trying a systemic medication, some doctors recommend treating localized diabetic peripheral neuropathy with lidocaine patches. Antiepileptic drugs Multiple guidelines from medical organizations such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Academy of Neurology, European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommend AEDs, such as pregabalin, as first-line treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy. Pregabalin is supported by low-quality evidence as more effective than placebo for reducing diabetic neuropathic pain but its effect is small. Studies have reached differing conclusions about whether gabapentin relieves pain more effectively than placebo. Available evidence is insufficient to determine if zonisamide or carbamazepine are effective for diabetic neuropathy. The first metabolite of carbamazepine, known as oxcarbazepine, appears to have a small beneficial effect on pain. A 2014 systematic review and network meta-analysis concluded topiramate, valproic acid, lacosamide, and lamotrigine are ineffective for pain from diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The most common side effects associated with AED use include sleepiness, dizziness, and nausea. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors As above, the serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) duloxetine and venlafaxine are recommended in multiple medical guidelines as first or second-line therapy for DPN. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded there is moderate quality evidence that duloxetine and venlafaxine each provide a large benefit in reducing diabetic neuropathic pain. Common side effects include dizziness, nausea, and sleepiness. Tricyclic antidepressants TCAs include imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, and nortriptyline. They are generally regarded as first or second-line treatment for DPN. Of the TCAs, imipramine has been the best studied. These medications are effective at decreasing painful symptoms but suffer from multiple side effects that are dose-dependent. One notable side effect is cardiac toxicity, which can lead to fatal abnormal heart rhythms. Additional common side effects include dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, and sedation. At low dosages used for neuropathy, toxicity is rare, but if symptoms warrant higher doses, complications are more common. Among the TCAs, amitriptyline is most widely used for this condition, but desipramine and nortriptyline have fewer side effects. Opioids Typical opioid medications, such as oxycodone, appear to be no more effective than placebo. In contrast, low-quality evidence supports a moderate benefit from the use of atypical opioids (e.g., tramadol and tapentadol), which also have SNRI properties. Opioid medications are recommended as second or third-line treatment for DPN. ===Medical devices=== Monochromatic infrared photo energy treatment (MIRE) has been shown to be an effective therapy in reducing and often eliminating pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. The studied wavelength of 890 nm is able to penetrate into the subcutaneous tissue where it acts upon a specialized part of the cell called the cytochrome C. The infrared light energy prompts the cytochrome C to release nitric oxide into the cells. The nitric oxide in turn promotes vasodilation which results in increased blood flow that helps nourish damaged nerve cells. Once the nutrient rich blood is able to reach the affected areas (typically the feet, lower legs and hands) it promotes the regeneration of nerve tissues and helps reduce inflammation thereby reducing and/or eliminating pain in the area. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential current (IFC) use a painless electric current and the physiological effects from low frequency electrical stimulation to relieve stiffness, improve mobility, relieve neuropathic pain, reduce oedema, and heal resistant foot ulcers. ===Physical therapy=== Physical therapy may help reduce dependency on pain relieving drug therapies. Certain physiotherapy techniques can help alleviate symptoms brought on from diabetic neuropathy such as deep pain in the feet and legs, tingling or burning sensation in extremities, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, sexual dysfunction, and diabetic foot. Gait training, posture training, and teaching these patients the basic principles of off-loading can help prevent and/or stabilize foot complications such as foot ulcers. Off- loading techniques can include the use of mobility aids (e.g. crutches) or foot splints. Gait re-training would also be beneficial for individuals who have lost limbs, due to diabetic neuropathy, and now wear a prosthesis. Exercise programs, along with manual therapy, will help to prevent muscle contractures, spasms and atrophy. These programs may include general muscle stretching to maintain muscle length and a person's range of motion. General muscle strengthening exercises will help to maintain muscle strength and reduce muscle wasting. Aerobic exercise such as swimming and using a stationary bicycle can help peripheral neuropathy, but activities that place excessive pressure on the feet (e.g. walking long distances, running) may be contraindicated. Heat, therapeutic ultrasound, hot wax are also useful for treating diabetic neuropathy. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can improve sexual dysfunction caused by neuropathy. ===Other=== Low-quality evidence supports a moderate-large beneficial effect of botulinum toxin injections. There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions for the utility of the cannabinoids nabilone and nabiximols. ==Prognosis== The mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy are poorly understood. At present, treatment alleviates pain and can control some associated symptoms, but the process is generally progressive. As a complication, there is an increased risk of injury to the feet because of loss of sensation (see diabetic foot). Small infections can progress to ulceration and this may require amputation. ==Epidemiology== Globally diabetic neuropathy affects approximately 132 million people as of 2010 (1.9% of the population). Diabetes is the leading known cause of neuropathy in developed countries, and neuropathy is the most common complication and greatest source of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. It is estimated that neuropathy affects 25% of people with diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy is implicated in 50–75% of nontraumatic amputations. The main risk factor for diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia. In the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, 1995) study, the annual incidence of neuropathy was 2% per year but dropped to 0.56% with intensive treatment of Type 1 diabetics. The progression of neuropathy is dependent on the degree of glycemic control in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Duration of diabetes, age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, height, and hyperlipidemia are also risk factors for diabetic neuropathy. ==References== ==Further reading== * * == External links == *Diabetic Neuropathy at WebMD *Diabetic Polyneuropathy at Medscape *Diabetic Nerve Problems.

They gained public attention when their single \\"Relapse\\" gained popularity on alternative radio stations such as Triple J, leading them to be signed by the record label Eleven: A Music Company. They released three studio albums (all three of which entered the top ten in the ARIA charts), two EPs, and ten singles. == Early history == Katy Steele's father Rick Steele is a local blues musician in various cover bands, and her brothers Jesse and Luke were both members of The Sleepy Jackson. Jesse left the band in 2000. Steele was the singer-songwriter and guitarist in her band, The Plastik Scene. A friend of Luke's, Simon Leach, heard Steele singing at her brother's 21st birthday party. \\"Katy was always there... She was around 15 when I saw her sing. Three years later, Katy and I were playing together.\\" Steele left her band and, with Leach as drummer, they performed several gigs as a duo. Scott ('Barney') O'Donoghue later offered to play bass guitar. Leach became tired of percussion and began playing guitar when Matt Chequer joined on drums. In 2002 Little Birdy was formed, named after the Ween song of the same name. A demo, leaked to radio, was played on alternative stations. A friend of the band dropped a copy at band manager Phil Stevens' home (manager of The Waifs, John Butler Trio and The Flairz). Stevens offered his management services. The band supported Placebo, Morcheeba, and The Superjesus in Perth concerts. A home recording of one of their songs won a WAMi Award for \\"Indie-Alternative Song of the Year\\". Triple J, a national radio station, started playing an early version of \\"Relapse\\", while local Perth radio station Nova 93.7 aired a demo of \\"Baby Blue\\". As a result of independent media coverage and radio playing demos, Australian labels sought to sign the band. Little Birdy opted for the independent Eleven label with distribution through Virgin Records-EMI. Steele, along with Leach, who was a graphic designer, quit their jobs and became full- time musicians after the signing. == Recording career == Little Birdy released their self-titled debut EP Little Birdy in October 2003, which peaked at No. 27 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \\"Relapse\\" reached No. 16 on the Triple J Hottest 100 and \\"Baby Blue\\" attained No. 25\\\\. In September, Steele, in an interview on Whammo.com.au, described the band's progress: \\"I think we've already written a lot of the first album already. A lot of songs we play live would be awesome if they were recorded\\". The band played gigs in London and New York City later that year, with interest from international record companies. Their second EP, This Is a Love Song, was issued in March 2004 and debuted at No. 22. Also in that month, Steele won the inaugural Jessica Michalik Contemporary Music Award, presented by The Big Day Out. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, \\"Relapse\\" was nominated for 'Breakthrough Artist - Single'. In October, the band released their debut album, BigBigLove, which was produced and engineered by Paul McKercher (The Cruel Sea, Spiderbait, Augie March) and peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It contains new versions of \\"Beautiful\\" (renamed \\"Beautiful to Me\\") and \\"Relapse\\", and includes \\"I Should've Known\\" with its original title of \\"Andy Warhol\\". The album received generally positive critical reviews. Two tracks reached the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2004, \\"Beautiful to Me\\" at No. 8 and \\"Tonight's the Night\\" at No. 78\\\\. Another track, \\"This Is a Love Song\\", taken from their This Is a Love Song, attained No. 40\\\\. In 2005, at the WAMi Awards, Steele won 'Best Female Vocalist' and \\"Beautiful to Me\\" won 'Most Popular Music Video'. Additional nominations were, Leach for 'Best Guitarist', the band for 'Best Popular Act', 'Most Popular Commercial Pop Act' and 'Best Indie/Pop Act', and BigBigLove as 'Most Popular Album'. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2005, BigBigLove was nominated in four categories: 'Breakthrough Artist - Album', 'Best Rock Album', 'Producer of the Year\\" (McKercher), and 'Engineer of the Year' (McKercher). Also that year, Little Birdy's version of \\"Six Months in a Leaky Boat\\" from the tribute album, She Will Have Her Way, of Neil and Tim Finn songs performed by female Australian and New Zealand musicians, reached No. 96 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2005. During 2006, the band recorded tracks for their second album, Hollywood, which peaked at No. 9 in October. The first single was \\"Come on Come on\\", in September, which reached No. 18 – the group's highest charting single to date. It was placed 11th on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006. In 2008, the band relocated to Melbourne and started recording a third album, Confetti, which they released in May 2009 and peaked at No. 6. A website was created for previews of new recordings and videos of studio sessions. The album was self- produced and the band worked with engineer-mixer Steven Schram. It was nominated for 'Best Adult Contemporary Album' and 'Engineer of the Year' (Schram) at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009. In February, they issued a music video for the first song, \\"Brother\\". The song features Paul Kelly on backing vocals and harmonica. Confetti's first official single, \\"Summarize\\", was released in April, it was followed by \\"Hairdo\\" and \\"Stay Wild\\". In February 2010, Chequer announced on the band's website that Steele moved to New York and expected to work on her debut solo album, Leach was working on solo material, O'Donoghue was working with other bands, and Chequer himself was doing production work. Steele trialled some solo material at four Australian concerts in May. == Touring == Little Birdy undertook their own concerts throughout Australia in 2004 and 2005. They supported R.E.M. during the Australian leg of their world tour in 2005. Little Birdy appeared at national festivals in 2007, including Falls Festival, Big Day Out, Sonic Bloom Festival, Southbound (in Busselton, Western Australia), and Great Escape Festival (Sydney). The band played at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne and supported Eskimo Joe's national tour in May. They were unlisted performers at the 18th East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival. Little Birdy appeared at Sound Relief at the Sydney Cricket Ground in March 2009, which was a benefit concert for victims of Victorian bush fires and Queensland floods. The Sydney concert included, Coldplay featuring John Farnham, Eskimo Joe, Hoodoo Gurus, Icehouse, Jet, Josh Pyke, The Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I, Architecture in Helsinki, Marcia Hines, Taylor Swift, and Barry Gibb with Olivia Newton-John. == Members == * Matt Chequer – drums, percussion * Simon Leach – guitar, synthesiser, steel guitar * Scott 'Barney' O'Donoghue – bass guitar, vocals, melodica, harmonica * Katy Steele – vocals, guitar * Fergus Deasy – keyboards, vocals, synthesiser, guitar == Discography == ; Studio albums * BigBigLove (2004) * Hollywood (2006) * Confetti (2009) == References == == External links == * Category:Australian indie rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:Western Australian musical groups Category:Musical groups from Perth, Western Australia Category:2002 establishments in Australia ","title":"Little Birdy"},{"id":"515070","text":"Destination Games was an American computer game development company created in April 2000 by Richard Garriott, Robert Garriott and Starr Long, following their departure from Origin Systems. (\\"Destination\\" is a play on \\"Origin\\", the company the Garriotts founded nearly two decades earlier.) Destination was founded in Austin, Texas to develop massively multiplayer online role-playing games. At E3 2001, Richard Garriott announced a partnership making Destination the United States headquarters of South Korean MMORPG giant NCSOFT. As NCSOFT Austin, Destination has mainly focused on developing and supporting the North American version of NCSOFT's Lineage games. In 2007 Destination Games released its first game, Tabula Rasa, a sci-fi MMORPG. The game did not sell as well as was hoped, Richard Garriott left NCSOFT in 2008, and the game service closed in February 2009. The Destination Games website was taken down when NCsoft moved its United States headquarters from Austin to Seattle—calling it NCSOFT West—in 2008. NCSOFT Austin employed five people to run the casual MMOG Dungeon Runners, but announced in 2009 that support for this game will be ending in early 2010 due to low subscription numbers. As of October 2009, NCSOFT employs about 150 people in the former Destination Games office in Austin mainly working in server operations, quality assurance, and customer support for various NCSOFT MMO titles, however development operations have moved completely to other NCSSOFT subsidiaries on the West Coast.

A besom is a broom, a household implement used for sweeping. The term is now mostly reserved for a traditional broom constructed from a bundle of twigs tied to a stout pole. The twigs used could be broom (i.e. Genista, from which comes the modern name \\"broom\\" for the tool), heather or similar. The song \\"Buy Broom Buzzems\\" from Northern England refers to both types of twig. From the phrase broom besom the more common broom comes. In Scotland, besoms are still occasionally to be found at the edge of forests where they are stacked for use in early response to an outbreak of fire. ==Description== As a result of its construction around a central pole, the brush of the besom is rounded instead of flat. The bristles can be made of many materials including, but not limited to straw, herbs, or twigs. Traditionally the handle is of hazel wood and the head is of birch twigs. Modern construction uses bindings of wire and string (instead of the traditional split withy) and the head is secured by a steel nail instead of a wooden dowel. ==In Wicca== A besom is a tool used in Wicca to cleanse and purify a space which will be used for ritual. A traditional Wiccan besom is a hawthorn stave handle with bristles made from birch twigs. These twigs are tied on using thin pieces of willow wood. It is used to cleanse the ritual area before circle casting. While it does not usually touch the ground, it is used to \\"sweep out\\" the negative energies in a room, and is often held a few inches above the ground to do so. As a tool, the besom is usually thought of as masculine in nature due to its phallic shape and symbolism. However the besom's components are of both masculine and feminine orientation. The handle, an ash stave, is masculine in nature while the birch used for the bristles is thought of as feminine in nature. The besom is thought to be involved with fairies. The besom is an important part of Wiccan handfasting ceremonies in some traditions. The couple jump over the besom during the ceremony. Alternatively, the couple may jump over a small bonfire. ===Besoms and flying=== There is a theory that the origin of the idea of witches flying with their brooms is based in a ritual involving a psychoactive drug trip. The witches would prepare a flying ointment to aid them in their journey. There are many recipes for this ointment all having a base of either Atropa belladonna or Mandragora officinarum, both highly psychoactive drugs producing visions and encouraging astral projection. Witches mounted broomsticks and would leap around the fields, hallucinating with the aid of the flying ointment, in order to \\"teach the crops how high to grow\\". The ointment would give them hallucinations, which made them believe that they flew distances. == References == == External links == * Category:Witchcraft Category:Wiccan terminology Category:Cleaning tools nl:Bezem no:Sopelime nn:Sopelime ","title":"Besom"},{"id":"515081","text":"Circus Oz performing in 2009 Circus Oz is a contemporary circus company based in Australia. Its shows incorporate theatre, satire, rock 'n' roll and a uniquely Australian humour. It is the world's longest-running contemporary circus company. ==History== Circus Oz was incorporated in December 1977 in Melbourne and funded by the Australian Performing Group, with its first performance season in March 1978. Circus Oz was the amalgamation of two already well-known groups: Soapbox Circus, a roadshow set up by the Australian Performing Group in 1976; and the New Ensemble Circus, a continuation of the New Circus, established in Adelaide in 1973. The founding members were: Sue Broadway, Tony Burkys, Tim Coldwell, John ‘Jack’ Daniel, Laurel Frank, Kevin Gedye, Jon Hawkes, Ponch Hawkes, Robin Laurie, John Pinder, Michael Price, Alan Robertson, Jim Robertson, Pixie Roberstson, Helen Sky, Jim Conway, Mic Conway, Rick Ludbrook, Peter Mulheisen, Gordon McLean, Steve Cooney and Colin Stevens. Significant developments in Circus Oz's early years included: a 32-week season in 1979 at the Last Laugh Theatre Restaurant in Melbourne; the company's first international tour in 1980 (including London's Roundhouse, Belgium and New Guinea); the \\"Nanjing Project\\" (Chinese acrobatic master classes); and the group's relations with The Flying Fruit Fly Circus. As part of its international touring, Circus Oz has been to 29 countries and 210 cities all over the world, including New York City, London and Jerusalem. In late 2013 Circus Oz relocated to a new custom-built home base in Collingwood, an inner suburb of Melbourne. The Victorian government owns the facility, but it has been designed specifically to Circus Oz's requirements. This location includes a permanent Spiegeltent, large rehearsal spaces, outdoor areas, and workshop and props-making facilities. The buildings are approximately half of an abandoned college campus, and there is work being done by Arts Victoria to convert the remainder of the campus into an arts precinct, making it a vibrant multi-arts and community hub. ==Shows== With the exception of its first show, Waiter, There's a Circus in My Soup, Circus Oz did not name their seasons or tours until 2006 with the Laughing at Gravity tour. Each subsequent tour was then named until 2017. * Laughing at Gravity (2006) * Barely Contained (2009-2010) * See It To Believe It (2010) * Steampowered (2011-2012) * From the Ground Up (2012) * Cranked Up (2013) * But Wait...There's More (2014-2016) * Twentysixteen (2016) * Model Citizens (2017) * Precarious (2018-2019) * Rock Bang (2018-2019) ==Values== The founders wanted to create a \\"contemporary circus\\" (words used in their show programme \\"history\\" as early as 1980), with elements of rock'n'roll, popular theatre and satire. The company has an ongoing social justice agenda and has generally been open about supporting humanitarian causes. Over the years this has included women's rights, land rights for indigenous Australians and strong feelings about the plight of asylum seekers. One of the first \\"new\\" or \\"contemporary\\" circuses without animals (it predates Cirque du Soleil by several years), Circus Oz continues to make a show with only a dozen multi-skilled performers who all perform the entire show, doing \\"a bit of everything\\", from acrobatics and clowning to music and aerial work. The skills are high-level circus, but the show is usually comic and character-driven. The cast is a diverse mix of body shapes and ages, with an equal number of men and women. Their style is generally cheeky, anarchic and subversive, a balance of strong women and graceful men. The company have an ongoing social justice agenda and have generally been open about supporting humanist causes. Over the years this has included women's rights, land rights for First Nations Australians and strong opposition to the mandatory indefinite detention of asylum seekers. Circus Oz has performed in twenty-seven countries across five continents including four seasons on 42nd Street in New York, a number of seasons at Queen Elizabeth and Royal Festival Halls in London, a refugee camp in the West Bank, indigenous communities in the Australian desert and a glass opera house in the Brazilian rainforest. Over four million people have seen the company perform, and the show has been translated and performed in more than a dozen languages, including Hindi, Catalan and Danish. The troupe has broken box office records at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and represented Australia at many international festivals. ==Ensemble== Until 2017, the company employed a full-time ensemble of 12 performers (an equal number of men and women), plus a technical crew, production and artistic departments. Apart from touring nationally and internationally with their various shows, other parts of Circus Oz include: *BLAKFlip, a programme connecting Australian Aboriginal performers and artists with the circus, including masterclasses, casting, performances, traineeships and guest artists; *Circus Classes, public circus classes for the general public, adults, schools, and community groups to learn circus skills; *The Melba Spiegeltent, a venue with a programme of cabaret, innovative performance, and local community events; *SideSault, a Sector Support Programme, providing access to space for a selected series of small/medium- sized local performance groups (primarily using a circus vocabulary); *High Flying Teams, a corporate team-building and training programme using circus as a skill-base for corporate training. ==See also== *List of circuses and circus owners ==References== * * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Official website *Circus Oz Collection at the Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre Melbourne. *Circus in Australia at the Australian culture and recreation portal *The Circus Oz Living Archive collection.

The Armed Services Committee was created as a result of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 following U.S. victory in the Second World War. It merged the responsibilities of the Committee on Naval Affairs (established in 1816) and the Committee on Military Affairs (also established in 1816). Considered one of the most powerful Senate committees, its broad mandate allowed it to report some of the most extensive and revolutionary legislation during the Cold War years, including the National Security Act of 1947.

P. Meehan that was published in 1868.Meehan C.P. The Fate and Fortunes of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell, Earl of Tyrconnel; their flight from Ireland, and death in exile Dublin 1868 Historians disagree to what extent the earls wanted to start a war with Spanish help to re-establish their positions, or whether they accepted exile as the best way of coping with their recent loss of status since the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603. Meehan argued that the earls' tenants wanted a new war: \\"Withal, the people of Ulster were full of hope that O'Neill would return with forces to evict the evictors, but the farther they advanced into this agreeable perspective, the more rapidly did its charms disappear.\\"Meehan CP, op cit, p.401 ==Background to the exile== A bronze sculpture commemorating the Flight in Rathmullan, County Donegal After their defeat at the Battle of Kinsale in 1601, and the end of the Nine Years' War in Ulster in 1603, Tyrone and the Prince of Tyrconnell, Lord Tyrconnell's elder brother and predecessor, had been forced into exile in January 1602 by the victorious English government of Ireland under the leadership of the Lord Mountjoy. They retained their lands and titles, although with much diminished extent and authority. However, the countryside was laid bare in a campaign of destruction in 1602, and induced famine in 1603. O'Neill was pardoned under the terms of the Treaty of Mellifont in March 1603 and submitted to the crown. When King James I took the throne in 1603, he quickly proceeded to issue pardons for the Irish lords and their rebel forces. As king of Scotland he had a better understanding of the advantages from working with local chiefs in the Scottish Highlands. However, as in other Irish lordships, the 1603 peace involved O'Neill losing substantial areas of land to his cousins and neighbours, who would be granted freeholds under the English system, instead of the looser arrangements under the former Brehon law system. This was not a new policy but was a well- understood and longstanding practice in the Tudor conquest of Ireland. On 10 September 1602, the Prince of Tyrconnell had already died, allegedly assassinated, in Spain, and his brother succeeded him as 25th Chieftain of the O'Donnell clan. He was later granted the Earldom of Tyrconnell by King James I on 4 September 1603, and restored to a somewhat diminished scale of territories in Tyrconnell on 10 February 1604. In 1605, the new Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester, began to encroach on the former freedoms of the two Earls and The Maguire, enforcing the new freeholds, especially that granted in North Ulster to the Ó Catháin chief. The Ó Catháins had formerly been important subjects of the O'Neills and required protection; in turn, Chichester wanted to reduce O'Neill's authority. An option was to charge O'Neill with treason if he did not comply with the new arrangements. The discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in the same year made it harder for Catholics to appear loyal to both the crown and the papacy. As the Dublin administration sided with Ó Catháin, O'Neill was invited by King James to make his case in 1607 to the Privy Council in London, which he never did. By 1607, O'Neill's allies the Maguires and the Earl of Tyrconnell were finding it hard to maintain their prestige on lower incomes. They planned to seek Spanish support before news of the Battle of Gibraltar arrived. When their ship dropped anchor, O'Neill seems to have joined them on impulse. He had three options: * Flee with his friends and hope for a reinvasion by Spain * Go to London and stay at court until his grievances were redressed * Do nothing and live on a reduced income as a large landowner in Ulster. Fearing arrest, they chose to flee to Continental Europe, where they hoped to recruit an army for the invasion of Ireland with Spanish help. However, earlier in 1607 the main Spanish fleet in Europe had been destroyed by the Dutch in the Battle of Gibraltar. Also, as the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) had been ended by the Treaty of London in 1604, King Philip III of Spain wanted to remain at peace with England under its new Stuart dynasty. As a part of the peace proposals, a Spanish princess was to marry James' son Henry, though this never happened. Spain had also gone bankrupt in 1598. Tyrone ignored all these realities, remained in Italy, and persisted with his invasion plan until his death in exile in 1616. ==End of the old Gaelic order== The earls left from the town of Rathmullan with some of the leading Gaelic families in Ulster; they travelled down Lough Swilly on a French ship. Their departure was the end of the old Gaelic order, in that the earls were descended from Gaelic clan dynasties that had ruled their parts of Ulster for centuries. The Flight of the Earls was a watershed event in Irish history, as the ancient Gaelic aristocracy of Ulster went into permanent exile. Despite their attachment to and importance in the Gaelic system, the Earls' ancestors had accepted their Earldoms from the English-run Kingdom of Ireland in the 1540s, under the policy of surrender and regrant. Some historians argue that their flight was forced upon them by the fallout from the Tudor conquest of Ireland, others that it was an enormous strategic mistake that cleared the way for the Plantation of Ulster.'The Flight of the Earls: A Popular History' by Liam Swords, Columba Press, 2016. From 1616 a number of bards outside Ulster had a poetic debate in the \\"Contention of the bards\\", and one of the arguments celebrated King James's Gaelic-Irish milesian ancestry through Malcolm III of Scotland. So it is debatable whether the Gaelic order had ended or was evolving. ==The journey== The Earls set sail from Rathmullan, a village on the shore of Lough Swilly in County Donegal, accompanied by ninety followers, many of them Ulster noblemen, and some members of their families. Several left their wives behind, hoping either to return or retrieve them later. The late Tomas Cardinal O’Fiaich, Archbishop of Armagh, gave a lecture at Rathmullan in September 1988 and recounted that the Earl of Tyrone allegedly “had a gold cross which contained a relic of the True Cross, and this he trailed in the water behind the ship, and according to O’Ciainain, it gave some relief from the storm” during the crossing to Quillebeuf-sur-Seine in Normandy, France. They finally reached the Continent on 4 October 1607.Donegal Historical Society in O’Domhnaill Abu, issue no. 11, of Summer 1989. This supposed relic of the True Cross was probably a minor relic taken from that kept at Holy Cross Abbey, which they had previously visited en route to Kinsale in 1601. Their destination was Spain, but they disembarked in France. The party proceeded overland to Spanish Flanders, some remaining in Leuven, while the main party continued to Italy. Tadhg Ó Cianáin (sometimes quoted by historians as O'Keenan) subsequently described the journey in great detail. While the party were welcomed by many important officials in the Spanish Netherlands, he makes no mention of any negotiations or planning between the earls and the Spanish to start a new war to regain the earls' properties.\\"The Flight of the Earls\\", text by Tadhg Ó Cianáin Ó Cianáin's diary is important as the only continuous and contemporaneous account of the Flight. Its original title, Turas na dTaoiseach nUltach as Éirinn – the departure of the Chiefs of Ulster from Ireland – has been changed since the creation of the more dramatic phrase \\"Flight of the Earls\\" to the latter's modern literal translation, Imeacht na nIarlaí.Ó Muraíle, N. ed. Turas na dTaoiseach nUltach as Éirinn: From Ráth Maoláin to Rome—Tadhg Ó Cianáin's contemporary narrative of the journey into exile of the Ulster chieftains and their followers, 1607–08; Pontifical Irish College, Rome, (2007); ==The attainders== King James issued \\"A Proclamation touching the Earles of Tyrone and Tyrconnell\\" on 15 November 1607, describing their action as treasonous, and therefore preparing the ground for the eventual forfeiture of their lands and titles.\\"A Proclamation touching the Earles of Tyrone and Tyrconnell\\", 1607 No reply that is known of was made to the proclamation Their titles were attainted in 1614, although they continued to be recognised on the Continent. The attainders were not considered legitimate in continental Catholic countries of the day. Even within the context of English and colonial Irish rule, the attainder came about six years after Rory, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, had already died. As accused, for him to have been properly tried, he should have been tried by his peers in the Peerage of Ireland, under the presiding authority of the Lord High Steward of Ireland. However, he was already dead, unable to stand in his own defence, and his title already inherited by his son Hugh “Albert” O'Donnell; therefore in order to attaint the title, the trial would have to have been of Hugh “Albert”, who had in fact committed no crime. The 6-year delay in hearing the attainders was unavoidable, as his peers in the Irish House of Lords next sat in 1613, and dealt with the matter in the usual manner. The attainder was however considered a travesty of justice by his supporters, and was considered null and void by many on the Continent. The succession of the Earl of Tyrconnell's son, Hugh “Albert” O'Donnell, as 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell (1st creation) was therefore recognized as valid in the Spanish Empire, and he was given the same status under a new Spanish title Conde de Tirconnel. Under the Common law, the title granted by King James and accepted by the earl had potentially lapsed as soon as the Earl embarked on the ship without his king's permission to leave Ireland, and when it lapsed it could not then pass down to his descendants without some special waiver. Assuming that Hugh Albert was being punished for a crime he did not commit, and was not being given a hearing, misses the whole point of the law of attainder. Hugh Albert was never issued a Writ of Summons to sit in the Irish House of Lords as his father's heir. Hugh Albert also never came to Dublin in 1614 to argue his case for a waiver, so far as is known, and never accepted James I as his king. Until he did so, his title and his claim to nobility was considered to be \\"in abeyance\\". These attainders had a much greater impact on the people of Ulster. The 1603 peace arrangement with the three lords was ended, as they had broken its conditions by leaving the kingdom without permission, and their remaining freehold lands were confiscated. Chichester proposed a new plantation of settlers from England, Wales and Scotland, sponsored in part by the City of London merchants, which became known as the Plantation of Ulster. This had an enormous negative impact on the lower class Gaelic-culture inhabitants of Ulster. ==Change in Spanish policy== In the Papal bull ' of 1555, the Pope had conferred the title King of Ireland on King Philip II of Spain when he was married to Queen Mary. Philip II made no claim to the kingship of Ireland after Mary's death in 1558.Text of the Bull ' (in Latin) He engaged in a lengthy war from 1585 with her sister Elizabeth I, and he and his successor Philip III supported the Irish Catholic rebels up to the siege of Kinsale in 1601. He had been offered the kingship in 1595 by O'Neill and his allies, but turned it down. Given this lengthy support, it was reasonable for Tyrconnell and Tyrone to imagine that they might solicit help from Philip III, but Spanish policy was to maintain the recent (1604) Treaty with England, and its European fleet had been weakened from several conflicts, and destroyed at the Battle of Gibraltar by the Dutch over four months earlier. Therefore by mid-1607 Spain had neither the desire nor the means to assist an Irish rebellion. While the Flight is often described as a first step in arranging a new war, this must be seen as an emotional and false conclusion, as there were no plans or proposals at all from the Spanish side to support the earls. Spanish policy in the 1590s had been to help the Irish warlords as a nuisance against England, but they had been defeated by 1603. It could not be in any way in the interest of Spain to assist their unsuccessful former allies in 1607. ==Commemoration on the 400th anniversary== President of Ireland Mary McAleese arrives to unveil a statue depicting The Flight of the Earls at Rathmullan on 4 September 2007. The 400th anniversary of the Flight of the Earls was marked on 14 September 2007, throughout Donegal, including a regatta of tall ships, fireworks, lectures, and conferences. The President of Ireland Mary McAleese unveiled a statue depicting the Flight at Rathmullan. There is a permanent exhibition dedicated to the Flight of the Earls and the subsequent Plantation in Draperstown in Northern Ireland and at the \\"Flight of the Earls Centre\\" in the Martello tower at Rathmullan. In 2008 there were also celebrations to mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the Earls in Rome, with a celebratory performance by the Cross Border Orchestra of Ireland in Sant'Ignazio Church in Rome.Irish Get Special Place for Corpus Christi Events , Zenit, 21 May 2008 ==See also== *Tudor conquest of Ireland *Contention of the bards *O'Cahan *Tadhg Ó Cianáin *\\"The Hunting of the Earl of Rone\\" *Regiment of Hibernia ==References== ==Further reading== *Turas na dTaoiseach nUltach as Éirinn from Ráth Maoláin to Rome: Tadhg O Cianáin’s contemporary narrative of the so- called ‘Flight of the Earls’, 1607–8, Nollaig Ó Muraíle, Four Courts Press, Dublin, October 2007 *The Flight of the Earls, An Illustrated History, 2007, by Dr. John McCavitt FRHistS. *The Life of Hugh Roe O'Donnell, Prince of Tyrconnell (Beatha Aodh Ruadh O Domhnaill) by Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh.

The band took their name from the Back to the Future character Marty McFly. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, guitar, and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica, and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar) and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records. McFly rose to fame after fellow band Busted helped launch them by inviting them to tour in 2004. In 2005, they won the Brit Award for Best British Pop Act.\\"McFly BRITs Profile\\" . Brits.co.uk. Retrieved 21 November 2012 McFly's debut album Room on the 3rd Floor debuted at number 1 in the UK Album Chart and is certified as double platinum; this led to them becoming known as the youngest band ever to have an album debut at number one—a title taken from the Beatles. A month after the album was released, the band had their first UK headlining tour. The band's second album, Wonderland, which was released in 2005, also charted at number 1 in the UK making them the youngest band to have topped the UK album charts twice. Their third album, Motion in the Ocean, was released on 6 November 2006 and charted at number 6 in the UK. McFly released their All the Greatest Hits compilation album on 5 November 2007, which charted at number 4 in the UK. The band's fourth studio album, Radio:Active, was given away for free as a supplement in the Mail on Sunday on 20 July 2008, before being released in the conventional manner (via physical release) on 2 September 2008. Fifth album Above the Noise was released in November 2010 and charted at number 20. As of 2016, McFly have had 18 consecutive UK top 20 singles, seven of which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and seventeen of which were consecutive top ten singles. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), McFly has been certified for 2 million albums and 1.8 million singles in the UK. and more than 10 million records worldwide. In 2006, McFly appeared as themselves in the film Just My Luck, starring Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine. They released a US album, Just My Luck, which was also used as the film's soundtrack. They have also performed at various charity projects such as Comic Relief, Children in Need, Live 8, Sport Relief and Earth Hour. In November 2013, it was announced that McFly would be joining forces with Busted to form the \\"supergroup\\" McBusted. They played a 34-date tour with both Busted and McFly songs. The only member of the original groups not to participate in the new lineup was former Busted singer Charlie Simpson. After Simpson's return to Busted in November 2015, McFly made a return and sold out their Anthology Tour in September 2016. After that, the band took an indefinite hiatus, with their Twitter account confirming that the boys were focusing on solo projects in 2018. In January 2019, Poynter confirmed via a podcast that the band would be reforming that year with a new album and tour. In September the band announced a new album of previously unreleased material and a concert at the O2 Arena in November 2019, followed by a 2020 come-back arena tour. ==History2002–2004: Formation and Room on the 3rd Floor=== In 2001, Tom Fletcher auditioned for Busted, but lost out on the place to Charlie Simpson. Fletcher was originally accepted as part of Busted's line-up, but Island Records went on to reassess the situation and eventually decided to have the band as a three-piece rather than a four-piece. Though the record label decided against offering Fletcher a place in Busted, they were intrigued by his songwriting talents and later offered him a place on Busted's songwriting 'team', alongside band member (and already accomplished songwriter) James Bourne, whom Fletcher credits with helping him to compose melodies. While writing Busted's second album, A Present for Everyone, Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Danny Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boyband, for which they were intended. Fletcher was impressed with Jones' unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne) to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the NME magazine. The pair, both Essex lads, coincidentally turned up at the same audition and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band The Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd's T-shirt. McFly's early sound was surf/pop rock. Their debut single, \\"5 Colours in Her Hair\\", released 29 March 2004, entered the UK Singles Chart at number 1 in April 2004 and stayed there the following week. In July 2004 their second single, \\"Obviously\\", also topped the charts. This was followed by the album Room on the 3rd Floor debuting at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. It would go on to be certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album broke records, as McFly earned an award from Guinness World Records for being the youngest band to have a debut album enter the charts in the top position, a distinction previously held by The Beatles. The idea for the album name came from where Jones and Fletcher wrote most of the songs for the album: room 363 in the InterContinental Hotel in London. The third single, \\"That Girl\\", was released on 6 September 2004, placing at number 3. The fourth single, Room on the 3rd Floor, the album's title track, was released on 15 November 2004 and reached number 5. McFly supported Busted on their nationwide arena tour along with V in February 2004 and then had their first headlining tour in September 2004. ===2004–2007: Wonderland and Motion in the Ocean=== In March 2005, McFly released a double A-side of \\"All About You/You've Got a Friend\\" from their second album, Wonderland, which featured a 60-piece orchestra.

The album itself was released on 29 August 2005 entering at number 1. The third single from Wonderland, \\"I Wanna Hold You\\", was released on 17 October 2005 with an unknown song Easy Way Out on the single and it gave them their 6th top 3 single. Their fourth and final single, \\"Ultraviolet/The Ballad of Paul K\\" from Wonderland was released on 12 December 2005 and reached number 9. McFly headlined their Wonderland Arena Tour, which started on 15 September 2005, supported by Tyler James and Famous Last Words.

The original single release date was due to be 26 February, but the band took up the offer to return at that time to the town of Kamwokya in Uganda, which they previously visited for Comic Relief in 2005. Until 1 January 2016,\\"Baby's Coming Back/Transylvania\\" held the record for the biggest fall from number one for a non-limited edition single.

The band are currently on a hiatus but hint on a future reunion, with Jones stating \\"It's really nice to have a bit of breathing space after 12½ years with McFly.

Talking to 1883 Magazine, Fletcher said: \\"After doing two massive Arena tours with McBusted, we really wanted to do something different for this tour to herald the return of McFly. So we're playing some iconic rock venues that will allow our fans to experience the songs in a much more up close and personal environment.\\" They also revealed that they'll be making new music after the tour, with Judd stating, \\"We all agreed to go on tour first and then that will be the catalyst of what's to come.\\" On 25 May 2016, it was announced the band would have to postpone the Anthology Tour due to Judd herniating a disc in his neck. McFly eventually toured in September 2016. ===2016–2019: Indefinite hiatus=== After the tour, the band revealed that they had scrapped two albums worth of songs recorded since Above the Noise. Fletcher said: \\"After a certain amount of time, you feel like that was where you were at, at a moment[...]If we released stuff we recorded three years ago, we wouldn't be 100 per cent behind it any more. We still love the songs but we'd be excited about doing new things.\\" The following day, they announced that they would finally begin recording new material in January 2017. In December 2016, Judd revealed that the McBusted-recorded song 'Getting It Out' would have appeared on the band's scrapped album.

In early 2018, it was announced Poynter was to go on tour with the band A. Those tour dates are now completed and it is unknown whether Poynter will play with them again. Judd is currently promoting his new book 'Get Fit, Get Happy' as well as raising his new son Kit. A writing trip was last taken in January 2017 for their sixth album, otherwise no obvious progression has been made towards album six.

The members still support each other on their individual projects such as Tom, Jones and Judd collaborating in March 2018. All members have stated that new music will eventually be released when the time and music is right. Poynter has started a band called Ink.

Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said \\"it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band in the world right now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!\\". Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was \\"something special\\" because \\"they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up\\". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said \\"Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band.\\" Also citing McFly as influences are British pop rock band The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 Memory Lane tour. Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated \\"McFly is a band we love to be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances.\\" Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining \\"McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like the next generation of their take on pop,\\" while bassist Connor Ball continued \\"They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful.\\" Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating \\"Their debut album was a first in all of our collections\\". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said \\"How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance.\\" McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating \\"Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now.\\" The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, \\"That Girl\\", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally \\"Five Colours in Her Hair\\", which featured on the digital EP for their second single \\"Wild Heart\\". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song \\"High Hopes\\" which was co- written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said \\"We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation... We find ourselves going to the same minor guitar chords like McFly would.\\" 5 Seconds of Summer have themselves confirmed that McFly are an influence on their music on a number of occasions, while they have also been compared to McFly in reviews. Fletcher is credited as having co-written the 5 Seconds of Summer track \\"Try Hard\\". The song was originally released onto YouTube on 1 June 2013, and in 2014 featured as a B-Side to their hit single \\"Don't Stop\\". The band had written with McFly during a 6-month stay in London, and Guitarist and vocalist, Luke Hemmings had mentioned a second song called \\"Take It Away\\" that was penned with McFly for their debut album. Despite this, the track did not feature on the release. When UK pop/R&B; group Rixton were asked which bands they had looked up to when they were younger, Jake Roche said, \\"I listened to a lot of McFly when I was growing up. I was a part of that era.\\" He continued \\"these guys came out with instruments and they played and wrote all their own stuff and I was like, that's great – I want to do that.\\" Band member Charley Bagnall agreed, saying, \\"McFly was a huge part of my life.\\" Roche's mother, English singer and TV presenter Coleen Nolan, said, \\"To me he's still that little boy I watched singing and dancing around to McFly records...I took him to their show in Manchester when he was nine or 10 and he said to me, 'Mum, one day that will be me up there.'\\" Other acts to cite McFly as musical influences include R5. Especially in their early years the pop-rock band cited McFly as a big influence, and were a favourite of oldest band member and bassist Riker Lynch, mentioning them in multiple interviews, as well as covering their songs as part of interviews as well as during soundchecks and early concerts, which included covers of McFly's That Girl and All About You. Plus Riker sang a cover of Obviously while on the Glee Live tour to which Fletcher commented, and covers of Love is Easy, Star Girl and All About You with fans at a Glee event after learning of the passing of castmate Cory Monteith. Asked about influencing a new generation of bands, Jones stated, \\"There's a few bands, like the 1D boys, and they're all getting to that age where Busted or McFly was the first gig they ever went to. It's really nice to see that bands are taking influence from what you do.\\" He continued, \\"to actually see people in bands picking up guitars and doing their thing – any musical influence that we can give them – is amazing to see.\\" ==Discography== Studio albums * Room on the 3rd Floor (2004) * Wonderland (2005) * Motion in the Ocean (2006) * Radio:Active (2008) * Above the Noise (2010) * Young Dumb Thrills (2020) ==Members== * Tom Fletcher – Lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, ukulele, backing vocals * Danny Jones – Lead vocals, lead guitar, harmonica, backing vocals * Dougie Poynter – Bass guitar, backing and occasional lead vocals * Harry Judd – Drums, percussion Touring members * Isaac Aryee – keyboards ==Tours== * McFly: The Tour (2004) * Wonderland (2005) * Motion in the Ocean (2006) * Up Close and Personal (2007) * Greatest Hits (2007) * Radio:Active (2008) * Up Close ... and This Time It's Personal (2009) * Before the Noise (2010) * Above the Noise (2011) * Keep Calm & Play Louder (2012) * Memory Lane (2013) * 10th Anniversary Shows (2013) * Anthology Tour (2016) * The Lost Songs Tour (2019, 2020) ==Awards== 2004 * Walt Disney Awards – Best Newcomer * Smash Hits Awards – Best UK Band * Smash Hits Awards – Best Album for Room on the 3rd Floor * Smash Hits Awards – Best Video for \\"That Girl\\" * Smash Hits Awards – Best Stars of the Year * Smash Hits Awards – Most Fanciable Male (Danny Jones) 2005 * Smash Hits Awards – Best UK Band * Smash Hits Awards – Most Snoggable Male (Danny Jones) * Smash Hits Awards – Best Single for \\"All About You'\\" * Smash Hits Awards – Best Album for Wonderland * BRIT Awards – Best Pop Act 2006 * Virgin.net Music Awards – God Group * BT Digital Music Award for People's Choice Award for Best Official Music Site 2007 * Nickelodeon UK Kids Choice Awards – Best Band (also hosted) * UK Festival Awards – Best Pop Act (for appearance at V Festival) * Virgin.net Music Awards – Best Live Act 2008 * Nickelodeon UK Kids Choice Awards – Best Band * Star Smash Awards 2008 – Best Album (Radio:ACTIVE) * Star Smash Awards 2008 – Best Band * Star Smash Awards 2008 – Artist of the Year 2009 * Meus Premios Nickelodeon Brazil 2009– Best International Artist * UK Music Video Awards – Best Live Music Coverage * News of the World – The Most Sexiest Men of the Year (Dougie Poynter) * Also nominated for MTV Latin Awards 2010 * 4Music Video Honours – Best Video of 2010 for Party Girl 2011 * Nordoff Robbins – American Express Digital Innovation Award * In Rock Magazine – Best British Band 2012 * Nordoff Robbins Music Awards – Best Live Act 2013 * The Verified Teen Awards – Best Live Act * The Verified Teen Awards – Best Band 2014 * Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards UK – Favourite UK Band of the Decade (Honorary award) ==Publications== * McFly – Unsaid Things...Our Story ==References* Category:Brit Award winners Category:English pop rock music groups Category:English pop punk groups Category:Island Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 2003 ","title":"McFly"},{"id":"515133","text":"Leonard Darwin in April 1916 Leonard Darwin (15 January 1850 – 26 March 1943) was an English politician, economist and eugenicist. He was a son of the naturalist Charles Darwin, and also a mentor to Ronald Fisher, a statistician and evolutionary biologist. ==Biography== Leonard Darwin was born in 1850 at Down House, Kent, into the wealthy Darwin–Wedgwood family. He was the fourth son and eighth child of the naturalist Charles Darwin and his wife Emma Wedgwood, and the last of Darwin's immediate offspring to die. He considered himself the least intelligent of their children – brothers Frank, George and Horace were all elected Fellows of the Royal Society. He was sent to Clapham School in 1862. Darwin joined the Royal Engineers in 1871. Between 1877 and 1882 he worked for the Intelligence Division of the Ministry of War. He went on several scientific expeditions, including those to observe the Transit of Venus in 1874 and 1882. In 1890, Darwin was promoted to the rank of major, but soon left the army and from 1892 to 1895 was a Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield constituency in Staffordshire,Retrieved 15 May 2020. where his grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood II, had also been an MP. He wrote vigorously on the economic issues of the day: bimetallism, Indian currency reform and municipal trade. Darwin married Elizabeth Frances Fraser on . She died 16 years later, on . On , he married his first cousin, Charlotte Mildred Massingberd, granddaughter of Charlotte Wedgwood, his mother's sister. Their shared ancestor was Josiah Wedgwood II. His wife Charlotte's paternal grandfather married his paternal aunt, after her grandmother Charlotte's death. Since Leonard's parents were cousins, Charlotte was also a second cousin on his father's side. Leonard had no children from either marriage. He was president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1908 to 1911 and chairman of the British Eugenics Society from 1911 to 1928 – succeeding his half-cousin once removed Francis Galton. He became the society's honorary president in 1928. In 1912 the University of Cambridge conferred on him an honorary doctorate of science.Details of career. Retrieved 15 May 2020. Darwin played an important part in the life of the geneticist and statistician Ronald Fisher, supporting him intellectually, morally and sometimes financially. Fisher, replying to Darwin's congratulations on his election to the Royal Society, replied on , \\"I knew you would be glad, and your pleasure is as good to me almost as though my own father were still living.\\" Some years before, Fisher had resigned from the Royal Statistical Society after a disagreement. Darwin regretted this and engineered Fisher's re-entry by making him a gift of a life-time subscription. Fisher's 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is dedicated to Darwin. After Darwin's death in 1943 at the age of 93, Fisher wrote to Darwin's niece, Margaret Keynes, \\"My very dear friend Leonard Darwin... was surely the kindest and wisest man I ever knew.\\" Darwin retired to Cripps Corner at Forest Row, East Sussex in 1921, with his second wife Charlotte Mildred Massingberd (died 1940), and lived there until his death in 1943.Tim M.

The screenplay was written by William Goldman. The story is a fictionalized account of the Tsavo Man-Eaters, two Tsavo lions that attacked and killed workers at Tsavo, Kenya during the building of the Uganda-Mombasa Railway in East Africa in 1898. The film received mixed reviews and became a box office success. It won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing for supervising sound editor Bruce Stambler. ==Plot== In 1898, Sir Robert Beaumont, the primary financier of a railroad project in Tsavo, Kenya, is furious because the project is running behind schedule. He seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel John Henry Patterson, a British military engineer, to get the project back on track. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, telling his wife, Helena, he will complete the project and be back in London for the birth of their son. He meets British supervisor Angus Starling, Kenyan foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne tells Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the project. That night, Patterson kills an approaching lion with one shot, earning the respect of the workers and bringing the project back on schedule. However, not long afterwards, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent in the middle of the night. His half-eaten body is found the next morning. Patterson then attempts a second night-time lion hunt, but the following morning, another worker is found dead at the opposite end of the camp from Patterson's position. Patterson's only comfort now is the letters he receives from his wife. Soon, while the workers are gathering wood and building fire pits around the tents, a lion attacks the camp in the middle of the day, killing another worker. While Patterson, Starling and Samuel are tracking it to one end of the camp, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, killing Starling with a slash to the throat and injuring Patterson on the left arm. Despite the latter's efforts to kill them, both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of man-eaters; they have always been solitary hunters. The workers, led by Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson. Work on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England to protect the workers, but is denied. During a visit to the camp, Beaumont tells Patterson that he will ruin his reputation if the bridge is not finished on time and that he will contact the famous hunter Charles Remington to help because Patterson has been unable to kill the animals. Remington arrives with skilled Maasai warriors to help kill the lions. They dub the lions \\"the Ghost\\" and \\"the Darkness\\" because of their notorious methods of attack. The initial attempt fails when Patterson's borrowed gun misfires. The warriors decide to leave, but Remington stays behind. He constructs a new hospital for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. When the lions seemingly fall for the trap, Remington and Patterson shoot at them; but they flee and attack the new hospital, killing many patients and Hawthorne. Abdullah and the construction men leave, and only Patterson, Remington, and Samuel remain behind. Patterson and Remington locate the animals' lair, discovering the bones of dozens of the lions' victims, leading Remington to the realization that the lions are killing many of their victims merely for sport. That night, Remington kills one of the pair by using Patterson and a baboon as bait. The three hunters spend the evening drinking and celebrating but the next morning, Patterson awakes to find that the remaining lion has slaughtered Remington as he and Samuel slept. After the two men cremate Remington, they burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the camp and the ambush that they set there. The lion attacks them on the partially constructed bridge, and after a lengthy fight Patterson finally kills it. Abdullah and the construction workers return, and the bridge is completed on time. Patterson reunites with his wife and meets his son for the first time. ==Cast== * Michael Douglas as Charles Remington * Val Kilmer as Col. John Henry Patterson * John Kani as Samuel * Brian McCardie as Angus Starling * Bernard Hill as David Hawthorne * Tom Wilkinson as Sir Robert Beaumont * Emily Mortimer as Helena Patterson * Om Puri as Abdullah * Henry Cele as Mahina ==Production == The film is based upon The Man-Eaters of Tsavo by Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Patterson, the man who actually killed both real lions. ===Screenplay=== William Goldman first heard about the story when travelling in Africa in 1984, and thought it would make a good script. In 1989 he pitched the story to Paramount as a cross between Lawrence of Arabia and Jaws, and they commissioned him to write a screenplay which he delivered in 1990. \\"My particular feeling is that they were evil,\\" said Goldman of the lions. \\"I believe that for nine months, evil popped out of the ground at Tsavo.\\" The script fictionalizes Patterson's account, introducing an American big game hunter called Charles Remington. The character was based on Anglo- Indian big game hunter Charles H. Ryall, superintendent of the Railway Police. In original drafts the character was called Redbeard, and Goldman says his purpose in the story was to create an imposing character who could be killed by the lions and make Patterson seem more brave; Goldman says his ideal casting for the role would have been Burt Lancaster. According to Goldman, Kevin Costner expressed interest in playing Patterson, but Paramount wanted to use Tom Cruise who ultimately declined. Work on the film slowed until Michael Douglas moved his producing unit with partner Steven Reuther, Constellation Films, to Paramount. Douglas read the script and loved it, calling it \\"an incredible thriller about events that actually took place.\\" Douglas decided to produce and Stephen Hopkins was hired to direct. Val Kilmer, who had just made Batman Forever and was a frequent visitor to Africa then expressed enthusiasm for the script, which enabled the project to be financed. The part of Remington was originally offered to Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins but both declined; the producers were considering asking Gérard Depardieu when Douglas decided to play the role himself. Stephen Hopkins later said he was unhappy about this. In early drafts of the script, Remington was originally going to be an enigmatic figure but when Douglas chose to play him, the character's role was expanded and was given a history. In Goldman's book Which Lie Did I Tell?, the screenwriter argues that Douglas' decision ruined the mystery of the character, making him a \\"wimp\\" and a \\"loser\\". ===Locations=== The film was shot mainly on location at Songimvelo Game Reserve in South Africa, rather than Kenya, due to tax laws. Many Maasai characters in the film were actually portrayed by South African actors, although the Maasai depicted during the hunt were portrayed by real Maasai warriors who were hired for the movie. ===Filming=== While the real man-eaters were, like all lions from the Tsavo region, a more aggressive, maneless variety, those used for filming were actually the least aggressive available, for both safety and aesthetic reasons. The film's lions were two male lions with manes. They were brothers named Caesar and Bongo, who were residents of the Bowmanville Zoo in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, both of whom were also featured in George of the Jungle. The film also featured three other lions: two from France and one from the USA. Director Stephen Hopkins later said of the shoot: > We had snake bites, scorpion bites, tick bite fever, people getting hit by > lightning, floods, torrential rains and lightning storms, hippos chasing > people through the water, cars getting swept into the water, and several > deaths of crew members, including two drownings.... Val came to the set > under the worst conditions imaginable. He was completely exhausted from > doing The Island of Dr. Moreau; he was dealing with the unfavorable > publicity from that set; he was going through a divorce; he barely had time > to get his teeth into this role before we started; and he is in nearly every > scene in this movie. But I worked him six or seven days a week for four > months under really adverse conditions, and he really came through. He had a > passion for this film. ==Reception== The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing (Bruce Stambler) at the 69th Academy Awards. However, Val Kilmer was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor. Reviews were mixed, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 49% rating based on 49 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"The Ghost and the Darkness hits its target as a suspenseful adventure, but it falls into a trap of its own making whenever it reaches for supernatural profundity.\\" Roger Ebert said the film was so awful it \\"lacked the usual charm of being so bad it's funny\\" adding it was \\"an African adventure that makes the Tarzan movies look subtle and realistic\\". Ebert would put the film on his list of the worst movies of 1996. Conversely, the late David R. Ellis listed this film at #8 on his \\"Top 10 Animal Horror Movies\\" countdown, a list he made to promote the release of Shark Night 3D. Hopkins said in a 1998 interview that the film \\"was a mess... I haven't been able to watch it.\\" In India, the film was remade in Telugu as Mrugaraju and released in 2001. ==Home release== The Ghost and the Darkness was released by Paramount Home Video on VHS on April 1, 1997. Later on, the film is available as a one- disc DVD. There are no special features besides a theatrical trailer. The film was released on LaserDisc in 1997 as a one-disc, double-sided release featuring a Dolby Digital audio track. ==Historical accuracy== The Tsavo Man- Eaters on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago Although Patterson claimed the lions were responsible for up to 135 deaths, a peer- reviewed paper on man-eating lions and the circumstances surrounding this notorious event states that only about 28–31 killings can be verified (Kerbis Peterhans & Gnoske, 2001). (This figure does not take into account any people who may have been killed but not eaten by the animals.) Patterson's 1907 book itself states that \\"between them (the lions) no less than 28 Indian coolies, in addition to scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was kept\\" were killed. This lesser number was confirmed in the definitive paper on man-eating behavior and the Tsavo lions by Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske (2001) and soon thereafter in Dr. Bruce Patterson's definitive book The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters published by McGraw-Hill in 2004. Patterson wrote the book at the Field Museum in Chicago, where the lions are on display. Kerbis Peterhans & Gnoske showed that the greater toll attributed to the lions resulted from a pamphlet written by Col. Patterson in 1925, stating \\"these two ferocious brutes killed and devoured, under the most appalling circumstances, 135 Indian and African artisans and laborers employed in the construction of the Uganda Railway.\\" The location where the bridge was built is now called Man-Eater's Camp. It is in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya, about east of Mount Kilimanjaro and southeast of Nairobi, at ==See also== * Bwana Devil (1952) * Mrugaraju * The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, by J. H.

An example is the colourful and elaborate peacock plumage compared to the relatively subdued peahen plumage; the costly ornaments, notably the bird's extremely long tail, appear to be incompatible with natural selection. Fisherian runaway can be postulated to include sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits such as behaviour expressed by either sex. Extreme and apparently maladaptive sexual dimorphism represented a paradox for evolutionary biologists from Charles Darwin's time up to the modern synthesis. Darwin attempted to resolve the paradox by assuming genetic bases for both the preference and the ornament, and supposed an \\"aesthetic sense\\" in higher animals, leading to powerful selection of both characteristics in subsequent generations. Fisher developed the theory further by assuming genetic correlation between the preference and the ornament, that initially the ornament signalled greater potential fitness (the likelihood of leaving more descendants), so preference for the ornament had a selective advantage. Subsequently, if strong enough, female preference for exaggerated ornamentation in mate selection could be enough to undermine natural selection even when the ornament has become non-adaptive. Over subsequent generations this could lead to runaway selection by positive feedback, and the speed with which the trait and the preference increase could (until counter-selection interferes) increase exponentially. Fisherian runaway has been difficult to demonstrate empirically, because it has been difficult to detect both an underlying genetic mechanism and a process by which it is initiated. pheasant, a sexually dimorphic species ==History== Peacock spider males perform courtship dances that display their boldly patterned mandibles, legs, and abdomens. Females are cryptic brown. Charles Darwin published a book on sexual selection in 1871 called The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, which garnered interest upon its release but by the 1880s the ideas had been deemed too controversial and were largely neglected. Alfred Russel Wallace disagreed with Darwin, particularly after Darwin's death, that sexual selection was a real phenomenon. Ronald Fisher was one of the few other biologists to engage with the question. When Wallace stated that animals show no sexual preference in his 1915 paper, The evolution of sexual preference, Fisher publicly disagreed: Fisher, in the foundational 1930 book, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, first outlined a model by which runaway inter-sexual selection could lead to sexually dimorphic male ornamentation based upon female choice and a preference for \\"attractive\\" but otherwise non- adaptive traits in male mates. He suggested that selection for traits that increase fitness may be quite common: A strong female choice for the expression alone, as opposed to the function, of a male ornament can oppose and undermine the forces of natural selection and result in the runaway sexual selection that leads to the further exaggeration of the ornament (as well as the preference) until the costs (incurred by natural selection) of the expression become greater than the benefit (bestowed by sexual selection). ==Peacocks and sexual dimorphism== The peacock, on the right, is courting the peahen, on the left. The plumage dimorphism of the peacock and peahen of the species within the genus Pavo is a prime example of the ornamentation paradox that has long puzzled evolutionary biologists; Darwin wrote in 1860: > The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me > sick! The peacock's colorful and elaborate tail requires a great deal of energy to grow and maintain. It also reduces the bird's agility, and may increase the animal's visibility to predators. The tail appears to lower the overall fitness of the individuals who possess it. Yet, it has evolved, indicating that peacocks who have longer and more colorfully elaborate tails have some advantage over peacocks who don't. Fisherian runaway posits that the evolution of the peacock tail is made possible if peahens have a preference to mate with peacocks that possess a longer and more colourful tail. Peahens that select males with these tails in turn have male offspring that are more likely to have long and colourful tails and thus are more likely to be sexually successful themselves. Equally importantly, the female offspring of these peahens are more likely to have a preference for peacocks with longer and more colourful tails. However, though the relative fitness of males with large tails is higher than those without, the absolute fitness levels of all the members of the population (both male and female) is less than it would be if none of the peahens (or only a small number) had a preference for a longer or more colorful tail. ==Initiation== Fisher outlined two fundamental conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the Fisherian runaway mechanism to lead to the evolution of extreme ornamentation: #Sexual preference in at least one of the sexes #A corresponding reproductive advantage to the preference. Fisher argued in his 1915 paper, \\"The evolution of sexual preference\\" that the type of female preference necessary for Fisherian runaway could be initiated without any understanding or appreciation for beauty. Fisher suggested that any visible features that indicate fitness, that are not themselves adaptive, that draw attention, and that vary in their appearance amongst the population of males so that the females can easily compare them, would be enough to initiate Fisherian runaway. This suggestion is compatible with his theory, and indicates that the choice of feature is essentially arbitrary, and could be different in different populations. Such arbitrariness is borne out by mathematical modelling, and by observation of isolated populations of sandgrouse, where the males can differ markedly from those in other populations. ==Genetic basis== Fisherian runaway assumes that sexual preference in females and ornamentation in males are both genetically variable (heritable). ==Female choice== Fisher argued that the selection for exaggerated male ornamentation is driven by the coupled exaggeration of female sexual preference for the ornament. ==Positive feedback== Over time a positive feedback mechanism will see more exaggerated sons and choosier daughters being produced with each successive generation; resulting in the runaway selection for the further exaggeration of both the ornament and the preference (until the costs for producing the ornament outweigh the reproductive benefit of possessing it). ==Alternative hypotheses== Several alternative hypotheses use the same genetic runaway (or positive feedback) mechanism but differ in the mechanisms of the initiation. The sexy son hypothesis (also proposed by Fisher) suggests that females that choose desirably ornamented males will have desirably ornamented (or sexy) sons, and that the effect of that behaviour on spreading the female's genes through subsequent generations may outweigh other factors such as the level of parental investment by the father. Indicator hypotheses suggest that females choose desirably ornamented males because the cost of producing the desirable ornaments is indicative of good genes by way of the individual's vigour. Other hypotheses for the evolution of male ornamentation include the sensory bias hypothesis, the compatibility hypothesis and the handicap principle. ==See also== * Good genes hypothesis * Handicap principle * Secondary sex characteristic * Sexy son hypothesis ==References== Category:Sexual selection * Category:Philosophy of biology ","title":"Fisherian runaway"},{"id":"515153","text":"Interactive proof can refer to: * The abstract concept of an Interactive proof system * Interactive theorem proving software ","title":"Interactive proof"},{"id":"515157","text":"Santa Cruz County is the name of two counties in the United States: * Santa Cruz County, Arizona * Santa Cruz County, California Category:United States county name disambiguation pages ","title":"Santa Cruz County"},{"id":"515163","text":"A quark is an elementary particle.

After finishing high school (today’s Wolker Grammar School) in Prostějov, Wichterle began to study at the Chemical and Technological Faculty of the Czech Technical University (now the independent University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague) but he was also interested in medicine. He graduated in 1936 and stayed at the university. In 1939 submitted his second doctorate thesis on chemistry, but the Protectorate regime blocked any further activity at the university. However, Wichterle was able to join the research institute at Baťa's works in Zlín and continue his scientific work. There he led the technical preparation of plastics, namely polyamide and caprolactam. In 1941, Wichterle's team invented the procedure to throw and spool polyamide thread thus making the first Czechoslovak synthetic fiber under the name silon (the invention came independently of the original American nylon procedure in 1938). Wichterle was imprisoned by the Gestapo in 1942 but was released after a few months. Merkur based apparatus for centrifugal casting of contact lenses ==Chemistry background== After World War II Wichterle returned to the university, specializing in organic chemistry, and was active in teaching general and inorganic chemistry. He wrote an inorganic chemistry textbook, the concept of which was ahead of its time, and also wrote a German and Czech organic chemistry textbook. In 1949 he expanded his second doctorate with the technology of plastics and devoted himself fully to the establishment of a new department of plastics technology. In 1952 he was made the dean of the newly established Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague. ==Prototype development== From that time he devoted himself to studying of the synthesis of cross-linking hydrophilous gels, with the aim of finding a material suitable for employment in permanent contact with living tissues. Wichterle accepted the help of one of his colleagues, Drahoslav Lím, and together they succeeded in preparing a cross-linking gel which absorbed up to 40% of water, exhibited suitable mechanical properties and was transparent. This new material was the Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), that they patented in 1953. Wichterle thought pHEMA might be a suitable material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses. On 1954 this material was first used as an orbital implant. On 1957 Wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses from closed polystyrene molds but the edges split and tore as the lenses were removed. In addition, they required hand finishing. He was determined to find a better way. Unfortunately, Wichterle and other prominent teachers had to leave the Institute of Chemical Technology after a political purge staged by its Communist leadership 1958. Research into contact eye lenses at the Institute of Chemical Technology came to an end. The International Symposium on Macromolecular Chemistry held in Prague in 1957 convinced the state leadership of the need to establish a centre for research into synthetic polymers. The Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (CSAS) came into being in 1958, with Professor Wichterle appointed its director. Since the institute's building was under construction at that time, Professor Wichterle conducted the decisive experiments to transform hydrogels into a suitable shape of a contact lens at his own home. ==Early contact lenses== By late 1961 he succeeded in producing the first four hydrogel contact lenses on a home-made apparatus built using a children's building kit (Merkur) and a bicycle dynamo belonging to one of his sons, and a bell transformer. All the moulds and glass tubing needed to dose them with monomer were also individually made by himself. On Christmas afternoon, with the help of his wife Linda, using the machine on his kitchen table, he finally succeeded. He tried the lenses in his own eyes and although they were the wrong power they were comfortable. Thus, he invented a new way of manufacturing the lenses using a centrifugal casting procedure. A few days later, he completed his patent application and produced over 100 lenses by spin casting. He built several new prototype machines using Merkur toys with increasing numbers of spindles which required the stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these rudimental devices, in the first four months of 1962 they made 5,500 lenses. The early experimental lenses were called Geltakt and the later production lenses Spofalens after the state enterprise SPOFA which manufactured them. In 1965 National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb which started to manufacture them in the USA. In 1977 the patents were challenged, mainly by Continuous Curve Contact Lenses and in May 1977 the CSAS sold these patents to avoid any liability if the court case failed. However, Wichterle and NPDC won the court case in 1983. ==Other achievements== Wichterle came to be well-known beyond the frontiers of his country not only through his achievements but also because of his activities in international organizations, chief among which was the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). He took part in the preparations for its Prague symposia in 1957 and 1965, which were much applauded by participants; he had a hand in the inauguration of its fifth, macromolecular, division, of which he was to become the first president, and he gained further credit by combining within it what were for normal administrative purposes the separate fields of pure and applied chemistry. Wichterle is the author of a large number of studies both great and small as well as several independent books on various aspects of organic, inorganic and macromolecular chemistry, polymer science and biomedical materials, while he had an even higher number of patents out for organic synthesis, polymerization, fibres, the synthesis and shaping of biomedical materials, production methods and measuring devices related to biomedical products. He is the author or co-author of approximately 180 patents and over 200 publications. This was typical of his attitude to scientific research which, he considered, ought to serve society and its requirements by any means possible, without distinction as to \\"pure\\" and \\"applied\\" science. In 1970, Wichterle was expelled again from his position in the institute, this time for signing \\"The Two Thousand Words\\" -- a manifesto asking for the continuation of the democratization process begun in 1968 during the Prague Spring. Punishment by the regime included removing him from his executive positions and making his research more and more difficult mainly by cutting off contacts from abroad and limiting his teaching opportunities. Full recognition did not come until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. In 1990, he was made president of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences till the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and was the honorary president of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic after that. Wichterle was a member of a number of foreign academies of science, he received many awards and honorary doctorates from several universities. The asteroid number 3899 was named after Wichterle in 1993. Furthermore, a high school in Ostrava (in the district of Poruba) in the Czech Republic was named after him on September 1, 2006. ==Publications== *Allgemeine organische Chemie, Berlin : Akademie-Verlag, 1955, 2nd ext. ed. 1959 ==References== ==External links== * ASCR Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Archives * Troublemaking Genius A biographical documentary about Otto Wichterle * The History of Contact Lenses (article) * Contact Lens History Category:1913 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Prostějov Category:People from the Margraviate of Moravia Category:Czech chemists Category:Czech inventors Category:Recipients of the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk Category:Czech Technical University in Prague alumni Category:Members of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin ","title":"Otto Wichterle"},{"id":"515170","text":"The sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) (previously: Tetrao phasianellus) is a medium-sized prairie grouse. It is also known as the sharptail or fire grouse. ==Taxonomy== The greater prairie chicken, lesser prairie chicken, and sharp-tailed grouse make up the genus Tympanuchus, a genus of grouse found only in North America. The full scientific name of the sharp-tailed grouse is Tympanuchus phasianellus. Six extant and one extinct subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse have been described:Hoffman et al. (2007), p. 15. * T. p. phasianellus: the nominate race or northern sharp-tailed grouse is found in Manitoba, northern Ontario, and central Quebec. It is partly migratory. * T. p. kennicotti: the northwestern sharp-tailed grouse is resident from the Mackenzie River to the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada. * T. p. caurus: the Alaskan sharp-tailed grouse inhabits north-central Alaska eastwards to the southern Yukon, northern British Columbia, and northern Alberta. * T. p. columbianus: the Columbian sharp- tailed grouse can be found in isolated pockets of native sagebrush and bunchgrass plains of Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and British Columbia. * T. p. campestris: the prairie sharp-tailed grouse lives in Saskatchewan, southeastern Manitoba, southwestern Ontario, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. This subspecies coexists with the plains race around the northern Red River Valley and prefers low seral stages of recently converted forests to shrubland. * T. p. jamesi: the plains sharp-tailed grouse makes its home in the northern Great Plains in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, eastern Montana, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and northeastern Wyoming. This race lives in the mixed-grass prairie, preferring a mosaic of native grasslands, cropland, and brushy/woody riparian draws, creeks, and rivers for a winter food source above the snow cover as buds and berries. * T. p. hueyi: the New Mexico sharp-tailed grouse is extinct. ==Description== Close-up of a male sharp-tailed grouse Adults have a relatively short tail with the two central (deck) feathers being square- tipped and somewhat longer than their lighter, outer tail feathers giving the bird its distinctive name. The plumage is mottled dark and light browns against a white background, they are lighter on the underparts with a white belly uniformly covered in faint \\"V\\"-shaped markings. These markings distinguish sharp-tailed grouse from lesser and greater prairie chickens which are heavily barred on their underparts(Connelly et al. 1998). Adult males have a yellow comb over their eyes and a violet display patch on their neck. This display patch is another distinguishing characteristic from prairie chickens as male prairie chickens have yellow or orange colored air sacs(Connelly et al. 1998). The female is smaller than the male and can be distinguished by the regular horizontal markings across the deck feathers as opposed to the irregular markings on the males deck feathers which run parallel to the feather shaft. Females also tend to have less obvious combs. Measurements: * Length: 15.0-19.0 in (38.1-48.3 cm) * Weight: 21.0-31.0 oz (596-880 g) * Wingspan: 24.4-25.6 in (62-65 cm) ==Distribution== Sharp-tailed grouse historically occupied eight Canadian provinces and 21 U.S. states pre-European settlement (Johnsgard 2002). They ranged from as far north as Alaska, south to California and New Mexico, and east to Quebec, Canada (Johnsgard 2002). Following European settlement the sharp-tailed grouse has been extirpated from California, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and New Mexico, (Johnsgard 1973; Connelly et al. 1998). ==Behavior== Sharp-tailed grouse nest with eggs ===Feeding=== These birds forage on the ground in summer, in trees in winter. They eat seeds, buds, berries, forbs, and leaves, also insects, especially grasshoppers, in summer. A male performing its mating display ===Breeding=== The sharp-tailed grouse is a lekking bird species. These birds display in open areas known as leks with other males, anywhere from a single male to upwards of 20 will occupy one lek (averaging 8-12). A lek is defined as an assembly area where animals carry on display and courtship behavior (Merriam-Webster Dictionary 2010). During the spring, male sharp-tailed grouse attend these leks from March through July with peak attendance in late April, early May (Conelly et al. 1998). These dates do fluctuate from year to year based on the weather. Johnsgard (2002) observed weather delayed lekking of up to two weeks by sharp-tailed grouse in North Dakota. The males display on the lek by stamping their feet rapidly, about 20 times per second, and rattle their tail feathers while turning in circles or dancing forward. Purple neck sacs are inflated and deflated during display. The males use \\"cooing\\" calls also to attract and compete for females (Sisson 1969; Bergerud and Gratson 1988; Conelly et al. 1998). The females select the most dominant one or two males in the center of the lek, copulate, and then leave to nest and raise the young in solitary from the male. Occasionally a low-ranking male may act like a female, approach the dominant male and fight him. ==Habitat selection== The sharp- tailed grouse is found throughout different prairie ecosystems in North America. They inhabit ecosystems from the pine savannahs of the eastern upper Midwest to the short grass, mid grass, and shrub steppe prairies of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain West (Aldrich 1963; Johnsgard 1973; Johnsgard 2002). Selection of specific habitat characteristics and vegetation communities is variable among the different subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse. Selection of these specific habitats depends on the quality of habitat available to grouse (Johnsgard 1973; Kohn 1976; Swenson 1985; Roersma 2001; Goddard et al. 2009). The major habitats used by sharp-tailed grouse, recorded in the literature, are savannah style prairie with grasses dominant and shrub patches mixed throughout, with minimal patches of trees (Hammerstrom 1963; Robel 1972; Moyles 1981; Johnsgard 2002; Goddard et al. 2009). In fact, Hammerstrom (1963) states the taller the woody vegetation, the less of it there should be in the habitat. The savannah style habitat is mostly preferred during the summer and brood rearing months through autumn. This general habitat is used during all four seasons for different features. Habitat selection and usage vary by season with; lekking, nesting, brood rearing, and winter habitat selected and utilized differently. ===Lekking habitat=== The lek, or dancing ground is, usually made up of short, relatively flat native vegetation (Manske and Barker 1987; Hanowski et al. 2000). Other habitat types utilized for leks are cultivated lands, recent burns, mowed sites, grazed hill tops, and wet meadows (Ammann 1957; Kobriger 1965; and Johnsgard 1973; Johnsgard 2002). Manske and Barker (1987) reported sun sedge (Carex inops), needle and thread grass (Hesperostipa comata), and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) on lekking grounds in the Sheyenne National Grassland in North Dakota. The males also select for upland or midland habitat type on the tops of ridges or hills (Manske and Barker 1987). Leks surrounded by high residual vegetation were observed by Kirsch et al. (1973). They noticed lek distribution was influenced by the amount of tall residual vegetation adjacent to the lek. Lek sites eventually became abandoned if vegetation structure was allowed to get too high. The invasion of woody vegetation and trees into lekking arenas also caused displaying males to abandon leks (Moyles 1981; Swenson 1985). Moyles (1981) observed an inverse relationship of lek attendance by males with an increase in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) within 0.8 km of arenas in the Alberta parklands. Berger and Baydack (1992) also observed a similar trend in aspen encroachment where 50% (7 of 14) of leks were abandoned when aspen coverage increased to over 56 percent of the total area within 1 km of the lek. Males select hilltops, ridges, or any place with a good field of view for leks. So they can see the surrounding displaying males, approaching females to the dancing ground, and predators (Sisson 1969; Manske and Barker1987; Johnsgard 2002). ===Nesting habitat=== Nesting cover is one of the most important habitat types needed by sharp-tailed grouse hens. Nesting habitat varies widely among the different subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse (Roersma 2001). Hamerstrom Jr. (1939) found the majority of prairie sharp-tailed grouse (T.p.campestris) nests occupied dense brush and woods at marsh edges. Gieson and Connelly (1993) reported that Colombian sharp-tailed grouse (T.p.columbianus) selected for dense shrub stands with taller, denser shrubs located at the nest site. Plains sharp-tailed grouse (T.p.jamesii) selected nest sites with dense residual vegetation and a shrubby component (Kirby and Grosz 1995;Roersma 2001). However, nest sites are usually characterized by dense tall residual vegetation (last year’s growth) with the presence of woody vegetation either at the nest site or nearby (Manske and Barker 1987; Prose et al. 2002). Goddard et al. (2009) state that the use of shrub dominated habitats has not been documented by many other researchers. Goddard et al. (2009) found that sharp-tailed grouse hens in Alberta, Canada selected more for shrub steppe habitats in their first nest attempts because of increased concealment provided by the shrubs than the residual grass earlier in the breeding season. Roersma (2001) also found that grouse in southern Alberta selected taller, woody vegetation compared to all other habitats assessed, and grouse used this area in greater proportions to available woody habitat. These findings contradict Prose et al. (2002), who states that residual vegetation is critical to sharp-tailed grouse nest success due to the early seasonal nesting nature of the grouse. ===Brood habitat=== Sharp-tailed grouse are a precocial species, meaning that they hatch with their eyes open, are self- reliant, and do not require the mother to feed them. Shortly after hatching, the chicks and mother leave the nest site in search of cover and food. Brood rearing habitats of sharp-tailed grouse have many characteristics including: shrubby vegetation for concealment, short vegetation nearby for feeding, and high amounts of forbs present (Hamerstrom 1963; Kohn 1976; Manske and Barker 1987; Roersma 2001; Goddard et al. 2009). This could explain why sharp-tailed grouse nest in or close to shrub communities. The shrub component in brooding habitat provides good canopy protection from direct sunlight and avian predators (Roesmra 2001; Goddard 2009). Hamerstrom (1963) and Goddard et al. (2009) both observed the greatest number of sharp-tailed grouse broods present in open, rather than wooded landscapes. Both hypothesized this use of open landscape was due to an abundance of insects for the chicks and green herbaceous cover for the hen to feed on. Habitat usage by sharp-tailed grouse broods is a function of time of day, available habitat, and weather (Ammann 1957; Kohn 1976). Brood habitats are made up of many complex habitat types. Broods may utilize shrubby areas or oak grassland savannah type habitats (Hamerstrom 1963). Broods utilize these types of habitats for cover, while remaining close to prime foraging habitats in the form of shorter vegetation with a mixture of native vegetation. ===Winter habitat=== Winter habitat usage by sharp-tailed grouse seems to shift toward denser cover for thermal insulation. Hammerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) noticed that grouse use thicker edge type habitat more than the open ground during the winter in Michigan and Wisconsin. Hammerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) also noted that birds, when found in open habitat, were no more than a few hundred meters from thicker cover. These birds were usually utilizing grain fields. Swenson (1985) observed the same trend in Montana. Hamerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) declared that use of forested habitat by sharp-tailed grouse vary by location, noting that sharp-tailed grouse in more semi-arid and arid areas utilize brush less frequently in winter. However, Hammerstrom and Hammerstrom (1951) did report that sharp-tailed grouse in Washington and California were observed using edge type habitats more frequently during winter months. Manske and Barker (1987) noticed a similar trend in winter habitat usage in North Dakota, noting that sharp-tailed grouse in small flocks joined together to form larger packs in severe weather. These packs move from open prairie, to shelterbelts, and adjacent croplands with standing corn and sunflowers. Habitat usage in winter varies greatly as a function of snow depth (Swenson 1985). As snow depth increases, habitat selection shifts from cropland and prairie to shelterbelts and woody vegetation. One habitat change seen by Hamerstrom and Hamerstrom (1951), was grouse would select large snow banks to burrow into, to keep warm during cold nights. The use of burrows was also noted by Gratson (1988). ==Habitat fragmentation== Habitat fragmentation has been one of factors driving the decline of all subspecies of sharp-tailed grouse across its entire range throughout North America (Silvy and Hagen 2004). The type of habitat fragmentation varies from ecological succession, as shrub/grassland areas transition into forested areas. Fire suppression, tree plantings, limiting logging practices, and an increase of invasive woody species have also led to habitat fragmentation. The largest contributor to habitat fragmentation has been the agriculture industry. The Homestead Act 1862 opened up great expanses of virgin prairie in the west to early settlers. By 1905 about 41 million hectares of the west had been homesteaded (Olsen 1997). Much of this land was in semi-arid rangelands with sub-marginal precipitation to support crop production (Olsen 1997). The plowing of this land represented a permanent change in the nature of the land. Another contributor to habitat fragmentation for grouse is unmonitored and excessive cattle grazing (Kirsch et al. 1973; Giesen and Connelly 1993; Kirby and Grosz 1995; Reece et al. 2001; Sidle 2005). Cattle can be an important tool to manage habitat structure for sharp- tailed grouse when managed properly (Evens 1968; Kirby and Grosz 1995; Sidle 2005). The habitat of sharp-tailed grouse was severely affected by early settlers before cattle grazers understood the impact to the environment from overgrazing. A secondary effect of early agriculture during the years of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s was when homesteaders abandoned the unproductive land (Olsen 1997). The United States government bought up much of this land through the Land Utilization Program, with management eventually controlled by the United States Forest service and the Bureau of Land Management (Wooten 1965; Olsen 1997). During the drought years of the 1930s, these agencies re-vegetated some of these areas with non- native highly competitive vegetation such as smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) (USDA- US Forest service 2001). These plants served their purpose by re-vegetating and protecting the soil. But these invaders became great competitors and directly affected native vegetation. In some instances crested wheatgrass and smooth brome have forced out native vegetation, creating monoculture habitats. Monoculture habitats are not favored by sharp-tailed grouse, as they prefer sites with high heterogeneity. Hamerstrom (1939) was quoted as saying \\"More important than the individual cover plants is the fact that most of the nests of all species were in cover mixtures rather than pure stands.\\" ==Habitat assessment== Research conducted before 1950 on sharp-tailed grouse habitat assessment was done visually. Hamerstrom (1939) reported sparse vegetation was seldom selected for nesting due to lack of adequate cover. Habitat generalizations were formed based on the number of individuals found at a given local. These assumptions were if more birds were present at one location and less at another, then the first must be the better habitat. Hamerstrom (1963) observed 119 of 207 (57%) grouse broods frequenting savannah style habitat. He concluded that the savannah style habitat was the habitat needed for best management. As the research on habitat for grouse species matured, so did the techniques used for assessment. Cover boards and Robel poles were developed to measure visual obstruction (VO) and create habitat indices. Cover boards were developed as early as 1938 by Wight (1938) to study white-tailed deer habitat. Wight’s (1938) cover board was 6 feet in height, marked and numbered every foot. Visible marks were counted to measure obstruction by plants. Kobriger (1965) developed a 4×4-foot board marked at 3-inch intervals with alternating white and black squares. He placed a camera in the center of the breeding ground at a height of 3 feet. He then placed the cover board 30 feet away taking photographs of the cover board. After compiling all the photographs, they were analyzed with a hand lens to assess the number of squares visible. This number gave him a vegetation index of cover classes. This method has been modified by Limb et al. (2007). Instead of taking photographs 30 feet away like Kobriger (1965), Limb et al. (2007) took photographs of vegetation back-dropped by a 1×1-meter cover board at a height of 1 meter, 4 meters away. These digital photographs were uploaded to Adobe Acrobat and digitized to the 1×1-meter backdrop (Limb et al. 2007). Robel et al. (1970) developed a pole to determine height based on correlated vegetation weight. The pole was duly named the Robel pole. Robel et al. (1970) found that VO measurements taken at a height of 1 m and a distance of 4 m from the pole gave a reliable index of the amount of vegetation production at a location. Hamerstrom et al. (1957) were quoted as saying \\"Height and density of grass were clearly more important to the prairie chickens than species composition\\" as reported by Robel et al. (1970). This was also believed to be true for the sharp-tailed grouse. These key aspects can now be assessed using the Robel pole, Nudds cover board, and Limb et al. digital photography method effectively and efficiently. ==Management== It is apparent that the effects of habitat fragmentation across all habitat types selected by sharp-tailed grouse are impacting this species. The management of sharp-tailed grouse habitat has changed over the years from observational (making sure current habitat is maintained) to more hands on approach. The management of lekking habitat and winter habitat are not as clearly defined in the literature as nesting and brood rearing habitat assessment and management. The development of the Robel pole and cover boards has become a key tool in habitat assessment providing land managers a means to inventory and study habitat preferences based on vegetation structure and density. The Robel pole has become the more favored of the two methods in recent years for habitat assessment. The United States Forest Service (USFS) uses visual obstruction readings (VOR) to set stocking densities for cattle based on the current years standing residual vegetation . This method is currently conducted on the USFS Little Missouri Grasslands, Sheyenne National Grasslands, Cedar River National Grassland, and Grand River National Grassland, all found in the Dakota Prairie National Grasslands in North and South Dakota(Forest Service, Northern Region (USDA).2001) . The Robel pole is a non-destructive method for inventorying vegetative biomass (Robel 1970; Benkobi et al. 2000). This method was used to create a habitat suitability index based on vegetation visual obstruction (VO), ranging from 0-30.5 cm with a suitability index rating of 0-1.0 (Prose 1987). Studies of nesting habitat by Prose et al. (2002) in the Nebraska Sandhills found that nesting sharp- tailed grouse selected nest sites with visual obstruction readings (VOR) of more than 4 cm. Similarly, Clawson and Rottella (1998) observed that 58% of nests (432 of 741) in Southwestern Montana were located in sites with an average VOR of 24 cm. The other nests in this study were located in sites with VOR’s of 11–18 cm. Reece et al. (2001) observed that sites with a VO of less than 5 cm near possible nesting locations indicated a decline in quality nesting habitat as average VO declined. The use of the Robel pole to assess habitat for sharp-tailed grouse has given managers a target height of vegetation structure to have at the end of the grazing season. This allows managers to set the appropriate stocking rate to best attain a desired vegetation height. As a rule of thumb, the average VOR reading for suitable grouse nesting habitat is 3.5in (8.89 cm). Lekking habitat can be managed by burning, mowing, clear cutting, and grazing across the entire range of the sharp-tailed grouse subspecies. Ammann (1957) found that leks that contained woody vegetation did not exceed 30% of the total lek area. Similarly, Moyles (1989) found a negative correlation with increased in aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) on lekking sites and the number of displaying males present. Trees may provide perches for avian predators but further work needs to be done on the effects of tree encroachment (Manzer and Hannon 2005). ==Provincial bird== The sharp-tailed grouse is the provincial bird of Saskatchewan. ==Status and conservation== These birds are declining in numbers and range due to habitat loss, but overall they are not considered a threatened species. ==Notes== ==References== *Aldrich, J.W. 1963.

The park is located in the south-east of Kettering, on the western edge of Barton Seagrave village. The park is owned by the Wicksteed Charitable Trust, with the amusement park being run by its trading subsidiary company Wicksteed Park Ltd (replaced by Wicksteed Trading Ltd after going into administration in 2020). ==Foundation== The park was founded by Charles Wicksteed, a wealthy industrialist who owned the engineering works of Charles Wicksteed & Co. Ltd in Kettering. In 1913 he purchased the meadowland, which was part of the Barton Seagrave Hall estate, with the intention of building a model village for his workers, to be called the Barton Seagrave Garden Suburb Estate. The Wicksteed Village Trust was set up to run the enterprise. After World War I, when local authorities were building public housing, Wicksteed decided instead to create a park with leisure facilities for local people, with refreshments and attractions, for which a modest charge was made, funding the provision of a free playground and sporting facilities. The first playground equipment, manufactured by Wicksteed's company, had been installed in 1917 and an artificial lake fed by the Ise Brook was constructed in 1921, with the park officially opened that year. By 1926 the park had a pavilion and theatre building, a rose garden, a water chute, bandstand, and fountain. The water chute, like many of the items of equipment in the playground, was invented by Charles Wicksteed. Barton Seagrave Hall was purchased by Charles Wicksteed in 1928. In 1931 a railway track was built around the edge of the lake. Charles Wicksteed died in 1931 and the Wicksteed Village Trust continued his work, adding features and facilities to the park. ==Development== The park continued to develop during the 1930s with the addition of a golf course, toy shop and aviary. A tunnel was added to the railway. The park attracted a record 40,000 visitors on August bank holiday Monday in 1935. During World War II the park remained partially open, with American troops billeted in the pavilion. Improvement continued in the 1950s, with the opening of a cinema, a miniature car track, a pets corner and an ice cream factory. In 1969 a new office and administration block was built. The 1970s saw the addition of a nature trail, a skateboarding rink and a ferris wheel. In April 1980 the park played host to the It's a Knockout TV show. Attendance had fallen during the 1970s but had recovered to an annual 750,000 visitors by 1982. Two roller coasters, nautic jets, a cup and saucer ride and a pedal cycle monorail were added during the 1990s.Peter Scott (2002) A history of the Wicksteed Park Railway, Reading, pp. 22-32. ==21st century== A ride at Wicksteed Park A mascot for the park, Wicky Bear, was acquired in 2000. The park hosts the local weekly parkrun and an annual fireworks display. During the display in November 2005, eleven people were injured in an accident when a firework shot into the crowd. In 2012 the park received over £1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards the cost of restoration of the lake.. Northamptonshire County Council and Kettering Borough Council also helped fund the work, which was completed in 2014. Baron Seagrave Hall was sold in 2012 to help fund the park. In 2016 the water chute at Wicksteed Park was given Grade II listed building status, as the oldest water chute in Britain, surviving almost as it was built in 1926. Wicksteed Park was awarded a further £1.78 million by the National Lottery Heritage Fund in 2018 for a project to preserve the park's history. In March 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic forced the closure of the attractions in the park, and in June 2020 Wicksteed Park Ltd announced that it had gone into administration. An appeal to save the amusement park raised £140,000 in donations from the public and £247,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. A new company, Wicksteed Trading Ltd, was set up and bought most of the park's assets and thankfully the park is now saved but a lot more fundraising still needs doing . ==Wicksteed Park railway== Locomotive \\"Cheyenne\\" at Wicksteed Park Railway in 1976 The narrow gaugeA History of the Wicksteed Park Railway - Introduction Wicksteed Park railway is one of the most iconic features of the park.

Goodrich Company, was an American manufacturing company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in Akron, Ohio in 1870 as Goodrich, Tew & Co. by Benjamin Goodrich, the company name was changed to the \\"B.F. Goodrich Company\\" in 1880, to BFGoodrich in the 1980s, and to \\"Goodrich Corporation\\" in 2001\\\\. Originally a rubber manufacturing company known for automobile tires, the company diversified its manufacturing businesses throughout the twentieth century and sold off its tire business in 1986 to focus on its other businesses, such as aerospace and chemical manufacturing. The BFGoodrich brand name continues to be used by Michelin, who acquired the tire manufacturing business in 1988. Following the acquisition by United Technologies in 2012, Goodrich became a part of UTC Aerospace Systems. In 1869 Benjamin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio, to relocate his business there. The company grew to be one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world, helped in part by the 1986 merger with Uniroyal (formerly the United States Rubber Company). This product line was sold to Michelin in 1988, and the company merged with Rohr (1997), Coltec Industries, and TRW Aeronautical Systems (formerly Lucas Aerospace) in 2002\\\\. The sale of the specialty chemicals division and subsequent change to the current name completed the transformation. In 2006, company sales were $5.8 billion, of which 18%, 16% and 12% of total revenues were accounted for by the U.S. government, Airbus and Boeing, respectively. Though BFGoodrich is a popular brand name of tires, the Goodrich Corporation exited the tire business in 1988. The tire business and use of the name was sold to French company Michelin. Before the sale to Michelin, Goodrich ran television and print ads showing an empty blue sky, to distinguish themselves from the similar-sounding Goodyear tire company. The tag line was, \\"See that blimp up in the sky? We're the other guys!\\" The company was also sometimes confused with Mr. Goodwrench as the two last names were similar, especially when B.F. Goodrich tires were featured on many General Motors cars and trucks. ==History== Goodrich dealer's decorated car in Salt Lake City c. 1913 1920 advertisement for Goodrich Silvertown Tires B.F.

The Goodrich Corporation sold off its automotive tire division in 1988. ===Early history=== In 1869 Benjamin Goodrich purchased the Hudson River Rubber Company, a small business in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. The following year Goodrich accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio, to relocate his business there. In March 1912, the Diamond Rubber Company, founded by the owner of the Diamond Match Company, was bought out by and merged with the B.F. Goodrich Company. The Diamond brand name and product line were retained and a subsidiary Diamond Rubber Company created for the marketing and manufacturing of them. The company helped found and start the Yokohama Rubber Company on Oct 13, 1917, in a joint venture between Yokohama Cable Manufacturing and B.F. Goodrich. B.F. Goodrich sold radios from the 1930s to the 1950s, under the brand name \\"Mantola\\". These radios were actually made by a variety of manufacturers for B.F. Goodrich. In 1936 the company entered the Mexican market in a joint venture, Goodrich-Euzkadi (now part of Continental AG). Goodrich ranked 67th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 The Troy, Ohio plant was purchased in 1946 from Waco. Since then, Goodrich has manufactured wheels and brakes for a variety of aircraft. Among these are commercial, military, regional, and business programs. This successful operation lies at the core of Goodrich's business. Competitors include the aerostructures divisions of companies such as Honeywell, Messier-Bugatti, Aircraft Braking Systems, (Howmet/Huck) and SNECMA.

By May 1990, Michelin Group had completed its buyout of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company from Clayton & Dubilier of New York. The deal was valued at about US$1.5 billion.INSIDE, New York Times, Published: September 23, 1989 B.F. Goodrich surrendered its 7% warrant to Michelin Group, and received $32.5 million additional revenue from the sale. ===Leaving tire business=== B.F. Goodrich by then exited the tire business entirely, in line with its plan to build its chemicals and aerospace businesses through reinvestment and acquisitions. In 1997 it acquired Rohr, a maker of jet aircraft engine nacelles (the aerodynamic structures that surround aircraft engines), expanding its presence in integrated aircraft components industry. In 1999 it acquired Charlotte, North Carolina-based Coltec Industries for $2.2 billion in stock and assumed debt, making the former tire maker the No. 1 supplier of landing gear and other aircraft parts. Headquarters were moved to Charlotte following this merger. In 2001, the company divested its specialty chemicals business to focus on aerospace and industrial products and, to signify the completion of its transformation, it was renamed Goodrich Corporation and adopted a new logo. In October 2002, Goodrich acquired TRW Aeronautical Systems, this division was mainly the former Lucas Aerospace activity, mostly based in the UK and France. In November 2010, Goodrich opened a large new manufacturing centre in Krosno Rzeszow, Poland. ===Fate=== In September 2011, United Technologies Corporation () announced a deal to buy Goodrich for $18.4 billion, paying $127.50 per share and assuming $1.9 billion in debt. On July 26, 2012, United Technologies Corporation purchased Goodrich. Unsold divisions of Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich were then merged to create UTC Aerospace Systems. Rocketdyne, Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial pumps and compressors operations, Clipper Windpower, and UTC Power (United Technologies' fuel-cell business) would be sold off to raise cash for the deal. On October 16, 2012, United Technologies Corporation secured an agreement to sell the Power Systems division of Goodrich (Twinsburg Ohio, Pitstone Green Buckinghamshire) to Safran for $400 million. The sale of this business unit was a condition that the Chinese competition regulators set in approving UTC's purchase of Goodrich. The Power Systems division had to be divested by the 16th December 2012. In the event the sale was completed on 27 March 2013. ==TechnologiesActuation and landing systems=== *Actuation systems *Aircraft wheels and brakes *Aviation technical services *Landing gear *Engine components ===Electronic systems=== *Sensors and Integrated systems *Engine control and electrical power systems *ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) systems and ===Nacelles and interior systems=== *Aerostructures *Interiors *Customer services ==PlatformsCivil=== *AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter (electronic ice protection system) *Airbus A320 series *Airbus A330/A340 *Airbus A350XWB *Airbus A380 *Boeing 737 *Boeing 747-400 *Boeing 757-200 *Boeing 767 *Boeing 777 *Boeing 787 *Bombardier Global Express *Canadair Regional Jet *Cessna Citation *Bombardier Dash-8 Q400 *Embraer 170 *Embraer 190 *Handley Page Jetstream *Lear Jet *Piaggio P180 ===Military=== *A-6 Intruder *Airbus A400M (Electrical power generation, flaps, transmission ice detection sensors) *B-52 Stratofortress *CH-46 Sea Knight (wheels or rotor brakes) *C-141 Starlifter *C-5 Galaxy *CH-47 Chinook (wheels or rotor brakes) *CH-53 Sea Stallion (wheels or rotor brakes) *Embraer KC-390 *F-14 Tomcat *F-15 Eagle (radome erosion boot) *F-16 Fighting Falcon (nosewheel) *F-117 Nighthawk *F-111 Aardvark *Harrier Jump Jet – all versions (hydromechanical fuel systems) *P-3 Orion *Panavia Tornado – all versions (engine controls, high lift control unit, flap and slat actuation, nozzle control) *S-3 Viking *SEPECAT Jaguar – all versions (hydromechanical fuel systems) *Space Shuttles (wheels and brakes; tire business sold to Michelin in 1988) *V-22 Osprey (wheels or rotor brakes) ==Restatements== On Feb 24, 2004, Goodrich restated its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings results for 2003 after Pratt & Whitney notified the company that it was drastically cutting its order for engine casing components. ==Notable employees== *Benjamin S.

The plot concerns the struggle for survival after a catastrophic earthquake destroys most of the city of Los Angeles, California. Directed by Mark Robson and with a screenplay by George Fox and Mario Puzo, the film starred a large cast of well-known actors, including Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Geneviève Bujold, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner, Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Victoria Principal, and (under an alias) Walter Matthau. It is notable for the use of an innovative sound effect called Sensurround, which created the sense of actually experiencing an earthquake in theatres. ==Plot== Early one morning, an earthquake jolts the Los Angeles metro area. On his way to work, former USC football player Stewart Graff, having just fought with his wife Remy, visits Denise Marshall, an actress who is the widow of one of his friends and co- workers. He drops off an autographed football for her son Corry and helps Denise rehearse her lines for a scene she is shooting later that day. At the California Seismological Institute, staffer Walter Russell has calculated that Los Angeles will suffer a major earthquake within the next day or two. He frantically tries to reach his superior, Dr. Frank Adams. Another tremor hits as Adams and his assistant are working in a deep trench, and they are buried alive. The scientists at the center debate about whether or not to go public with their prediction of a major quake. The acting supervisor insists that if they are wrong, their funding will be jeopardized. They agree on a compromise to alert the National Guard and police so that they can at least mobilize to help deal with the fallout. While checking out at a grocery store, Rosa Amici realizes she does not have enough money to pay for all her items, but Jody Joad, the store manager, says she can pay the difference next time. Joad learns that his Guard unit is being called up on the radio, so he leaves work to change into his NCO uniform. At home, his housemates harass and tease him for having posters of male bodybuilders on his wall. The tremor cancelled Denise's shoot, so she heads to Stewart's office, pretending to meet with a friend. The pair go back to Denise's house for drinks and end up making love. He promises to come back later that night and invites her and Corry to spend the summer with him in Oregon while he oversees a project. Returning to work, his boss and father in-law Sam Royce offers to hand over the company presidency to Stewart. After asking for time to think about it, Stewart calls Denise and breaks off their plans for later that night. He goes to Sam's office to accept his offer but is stunned to see Remy there. He assumes she has convinced her father, Sam, to offer the promotion to Stewart in order to save their marriage. Stewart storms out of the building, followed by Remy, when a major earthquake measuring 9.9 on the Richter Scale strikes, destroying much of Los Angeles and killing thousands. Sam and most of his employees find themselves trapped on the upper floors of their 30-story skyscraper as it fills with phosgene gas. They descend most of the way by the stairs, but the earthquake has collapsed part of the stairwell. Sam rigs a fire hose to a chair and lowers his staff down one at a time. Before he can descend himself, Sam suffers a heart attack, and Stewart climbs up to rescue him. Denise's son, meanwhile, has been caught on a bridge over a spillway, which has become entangled with high voltage electric cables. Denise finds him unconscious on the concrete and climbs down to save him. Unable to climb back out with her son, she hails a passing truck, driven by stuntman Miles Quade and his partner, Sal Amici. After saving Denise and her son, they drive in search of help, coming across LAPD Sgt. Lou Slade, who is organizing rescue efforts and commandeers their truck to use it as an ambulance. The simulated collapse of Mulholland Dam – and the subsequent deluge – forms the film's climax.Rosa is arrested for looting by a National Guard unit led by Jody Joad. Rosa assumes Jody is going to let her go, but he orders her to stay inside a secluded store for safety. Another group of troops arrive with Jody's housemates as prisoners. Jody executes them in an act of revenge for all the ridicule he has endured from them, terrifying Rosa and his subordinates. Stewart escorts his co-workers to the Wilson Plaza shopping center, now converted into a triage center, then goes off in search of Denise and her son. Soon after, Sam dies from his heart attack. Stewart ends up driving Lou around in search of survivors and they come across Jody and his regiment. Jody threatens to fire on them if they come any closer. Rosa emerges from the store, screaming and begging for help. Lou and Stewart drive away, but stop out of sight. Lou sneaks back and gets the jump on Jody, shooting Jody in self-defense and rescuing Rosa. As they drive away, they hear that another aftershock has destroyed Wilson Plaza. Surveying the damaged building, Stewart realizes there are survivors trapped in an underground garage three stories below ground. He and Lou crawl into the sewer and, using a jackhammer, drill through to the garage. Stewart is overjoyed to find Denise, who is one of the people trapped inside. As he hugs her, he sees his wife Remy standing just behind her. The Mulholland Dam, damaged by the earlier tremor, finally gives way, flooding the sewers. Lou and Denise make it up the ladder to safety, but as Remy climbs out, a man steps on the rung she's holding and she falls back into the flooded sewer. Stewart looks up at Denise, but he cannot bring himself to abandon his wife to death. He sacrifices himself when he swims after her and both of them are swept away, along with others. Denise walks away from the manhole in shock and grief. Dr. Vance turns to Slade, and says: \\"This used to be a hell of a town, officer.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" replies Slade, as tears well up in his eyes. Meanwhile, the remaining survivors take in the devastated Los Angeles cityscape. ==Cast== * Charlton Heston as Stewart Graff * Ava Gardner as Remy Royce-Graff * George Kennedy as Lou Slade * Lorne Greene as Sam Royce * Geneviève Bujold as Denise Marshall * Richard Roundtree as Miles Quade * Marjoe Gortner as Jody Joad * Barry Sullivan as Dr. Willis Stockle * Lloyd Nolan as Dr. James Vance * Victoria Principal as Rosa Amici * Walter Matthau as Drunk (credited as \\"Walter Matuschanskayasky\\") * Monica Lewis as Barbara * Gabriel Dell as Sal Amici * Pedro Armendáriz, Jr. as Emilio Chavez * Lloyd Gough as Bill Cameron * John Randolph as Mayor Lewis * Kip Niven as Walter Russell * Scott Hylands as Max * Tiger Williams as Corry Marshall * Donald Moffat as Dr. Harvey Johnson * Jesse Vint as Buck * Alan Vint as Ralph * Michael Richardson as Hank * John Elerick as Carl Leeds * John S.

Inspiration came in the form of the San Fernando earthquake of February 1971. Director Mark Robson and Lang were intrigued by the idea of creating a disaster on film that would not be confined to an airliner, but rather take place over a large area. Producer Bernard Donnenfeld helped produce the film, but was uncredited. Budgeted at $7,000,000, Earthquake found itself in a race against the clock with the bigger-budgeted disaster film, The Towering Inferno, which was being produced by Irwin Allen (The Poseidon Adventure) and financed by two studios (20th Century Fox and Warner Bros., a motion picture first). ===Development=== Lang scored a coup when he was able to sign screenwriter Mario Puzo to write the first draft during the summer of 1972. Puzo, fresh from the success of his novel and film, The Godfather, delivered the draft script in August. However, Puzo's detailed script necessitated a large production budget, as the action and characters were spread over a vast geographical area in Los Angeles. Universal was faced with either cutting the script or increasing the projected budget. Puzo's involvement with Earthquake was short-lived, as Paramount Pictures was anxious to begin development with the followup to The Godfather, The Godfather Part II. Because Puzo's services contractually were obligated to the sequel, he opted out of continuing any further work on Earthquake. The Earthquake script languished at Universal Studios for a short period, but was brought back to life by the huge success of the 20th Century Fox hit The Poseidon Adventure, released in December 1972. Fueled by that film's enormous box-office receipts, Universal Studios put pre- production on Earthquake back into high gear, hiring writer George Fox to continue work with Puzo's first draft. Fox was principally a magazine writer and never had written a screenplay, so director Mark Robson worked with him to narrow the scope of the script to fit into the budgetary constraints. After 11 drafts, Earthquake went before the cameras in February 1974. ===Casting=== While The Towering Inferno featured a larger \\"all star\\" cast, Universal was able to land Charlton Heston in the lead role. Rounding out the top billing were Ava Gardner (who co-starred with Heston in 1963's 55 Days at Peking), George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, and Geneviève Bujold. Richard Roundtree (riding a wave of success from the Shaft film series) was brought in after filming had already started, filling the part of an Evel Knievel-like motorcycle stuntman. Former evangelical Marjoe Gortner was hired as the antagonist, Jody. Relative unknown Victoria Principal was hired to play the sister of Roundtree's business partner, Sal, played by veteran actor Gabriel Dell. Walter Matthau was cast in a cameo role, for which he was credited as \\"Walter Matuschanskayasky\\". ===Set design=== Production necessitated the simulated destruction of the Universal Studios backlot in order to simulate the catastrophic earthquake of the title. Along with a clever use of miniatures of actual buildings, matte paintings, and full-scale sets (some of which were placed on rollers for a shaking effect), Earthquake used a new technique developed especially for the film: a \\"shaker mount\\" camera system that mimicked the effects of an earthquake by moving the entire camera body several inches side to side. This camera mount was used for most exterior scenes or other instances where shooting on location. ===Stunts=== Extensive use of highly trained stunt artists for the most dangerous scenes involving high falls, dodging falling debris, and flood sequences, set a Hollywood record for the most stunt artists involved in any film production up until that time: 141. Major stunt sequences in the film required careful choreography between the stunt artists and behind-the-scenes stunt technicians who were responsible for triggering full-scale effects, such as falling debris. Timing was critical, since some rigged effects involved dropping six ton chunks of reinforced concrete in order to flatten cars, with stunt performers only a few feet away. In other scenarios, some stunt artists were required to fall sixty feet onto large air bags from the rafters of Universal's largest stage (Stage 12) – for which they were paid the sum of $500. While every precaution was taken to prevent injuries, several did occur during filming. One stunt person suffered a concussion during the flood sequence (the accident was used in the film), and several stunt artists were injured during the elevator crash scene, since the set was designed to collapse upon them. ===Sound effects=== Universal Studios and Jennings Lang wanted Earthquake to be an \\"event film\\", something that would draw audiences into the theatre multiple times. After several ideas were tossed about (which included bouncing styrofoam faux \\"debris\\" over audience members' heads), Universal's sound department came up with a process called \\"Sensurround\\" – a series of large speakers made by Cerwin-Vega powered by BGW amplifiers, that would pump in sub-audible \\"infra bass\\" sound waves at 120 decibels (equivalent to a jet airplane at takeoff), giving the viewer the sensation of an earthquake. The process was tested in several theatres around the United States prior to the film's release, yielding various results. A famous example is Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, where the \\"Sensurround\\" cracked the plaster in the ceiling. The same theatre premiered Earthquake three months later - with a newly installed net over the audience to catch any falling debris - to tremendous success. The \\"Sensurround\\" process proved to be a large audience draw, but not without generating a fair share of controversy. When the film premiered in Chicago, Illinois, the head of the building and safety department demanded the system be turned down, as he was afraid it would cause structural damage. In Billings, Montana, a knick-knack shop next door to a theatre using the system lost part of its inventory when items from several shelves were thrown to the floor when the system was cued during the quake scenes. Sensurround was used again for the films Midway (1976), Rollercoaster (1977), and Battlestar Galactica (1979). The 2006 Universal Studios Home Entertainment DVD release features the original \\"Sensurround\\" 3.1 audio track, duplicating the original theatrical \\"Sensurround\\" track (but oddly in mono directed to the front 3 speakers rather than the original stereo mix), but no actual 'rumble' generator was used, and only the two control tones that activated the generator can be heard. In addition, the film's original soundtrack was remixed in Surround Sound 5.1 which was simply a tag as once again only the control tones feature on the track. ===Music=== John Williams' music for Earthquake was the second of his trio of scores for large-scale disaster films, having previously scored The Poseidon Adventure and following with The Towering Inferno. Williams scored both Earthquake and The Towering Inferno in the summer of 1974, both scores showing similarities to one another (notably Earthquake's theme and The Towering Inferno's love theme sharing the same eight-note melody). The music of the song \\"C'est si Bon\\" by Henri Betti is played on the guitar in the middle of the film. ===Pretests and re-edits=== After October, 1974 test screenings, Universal opted to cut 30 minutes from the film, notably from the pre-quake sequences, at the cost of some of the dramatic flow. This included a narration sequence about the San Andreas fault and an impending catastrophic earthquake that would occur in either Los Angeles or San Francisco. This scene was filmed and was set to be shown before the opening title credits (although it was removed at the last minute, it was eventually included as the opening sequence of the NBC television edit for the September, 1976 broadcast premiere). Also excised were lengthy scenes of Remy (Gardner) and Stewart (Heston) arguing at the beginning of the film. After Remy's fake suicide, Dr. Vance (Lloyd Nolan) arrives at the Graff home and begins to talk with Stewart (an old friend). Dr. Vance inadvertently informs Stewart that Remy had an abortion two years prior (he was told it was a miscarriage). Remy appears, and they fight because Stewart wanted the baby and Remy did not. Stewart storms off. This explains why Stewart resents Remy so much. (In the final cut of the film, they just seem angry at one another.) There was more of Slade's leaving the police station, and footage of Rosa's leaving the market was shot as well. She was filmed waiting for a bus and being offered a lift from a man on a motorcycle (this footage eventually was used in the film's television cut). Just before the earthquake, Stewart and Remy had a final fight (in front of Stewart's car) that was deleted as well. During the earthquake, there was a scene of a nearby lumberyard's falling apart, and this was removed from the final cut. Other deleted scenes were shot to wrap up many characters' stories after the earthquake. Walt Russell and Dr. Stockle – whose fates are undetermined after the quake in the theatrical release – were shown alive in the seismology laboratory post-quake. They were shown finding the earthquake's magnitude to be 9.9 on the Richter scale. The film's final scene originally had Denise's asking Lou Slade if Stewart had survived; upon hearing of his death, she walks over to Corry who has regained consciousness. ===The elevator scene=== The elevator scene, one of the film's more infamous shots, was compromised as a result of difficulties during filming. Originally, the occupants were pressed to the ceiling of the elevator as it fell down the shaft, and then dropped to the floor when the elevator crashed to the bottom. The scene was filmed several times, with several stunt people involved. Copious amounts of stage blood were rigged to spray the stunt people inside the elevator set with blood when the set came crashing to the ground. After several tries over two separate filming days weeks apart (the break in filming was an attempt to perfect the mechanical effects involved), and with unsatisfactory results, the decision was made on-set by director Robson to edit the scene with an \\"animated blood\\" effect to be added in post production. The optical effect was superimposed over a still frame of part of the unusable footage, resulting in the \\"cartoonish\\" nature of the shot. The television version removed the animated blood sequence. == Reception == Released in the United States on November 15, 1974, Earthquake ranked third among the high-grossing film of the year; The Towering Inferno was the highest. ===Box office=== The disaster film trend reached a zenith in 1974 with the combined releases of Airport 1975 (the first Airport sequel), Earthquake and The Towering Inferno. The films enjoyed staggering success, with The Towering Inferno earning $55 million in rentals, Earthquake earning $36 million and Airport 1975 earning $25 million. By 1976, the disaster film cycle had also left its mark on the list of all-time box-office champions, with The Towering Inferno ranking eighth, Airport fourteenth, The Poseidon Adventure sixteenth, and Earthquake twentieth. These successes ensured the flood of similar films throughout the decade. Earthquake eventually grossed $79.7 million ($379.8 million, adjusted for inflation in 2019 dollars). ===Critical response=== At its release, critics generally acknowledged the special effects in Earthquake while discounting other aspects. Without either panning or praising the film, Nora Sayre of the New York Times wrote that it was an improvement on Airport '75 and observed, \\"The impulse to shout advice to the screen—get out! go away! don't enter that building—is quite powerful, so this does rank as a participatory movie.\\" Judith Crist wrote in New York Magazine that \\"the nonsense is bearable for the spectacle. And ... here we have a feast of feats of destruction.\\" Pauline Kael wrote \\"The picture is swill, but it isn't a cheat; it's an entertaining marathon of Grade-A destruction effects\\". Roger Ebert criticized the \\"witless Earthquake\\" for \\"regarding [the effects] with awe\\". Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote the special effects were \\"terrific\\" but identified a basic problem with the story: \\"With a Poseidon Adventure or an Airport the ending is clear — people are saved ultimately thru their own or somebody else's enterprise. But with an earthquake, the final solution is out of one's hands, anyone's hands - even Allstate's. If the tremors don't stop, then everybody'll die; if they do, then only a few people will die. End of story.\\"Siskel, Gene (November 19, 1974). \\"Earthquake: Rattling experience\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 5. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the Sensurround vibrations \\"succeed very nicely in making themselves felt as well as heard and they set up an anxiety which makes watching 'Earthquake' a very ambivalent experience for anyone who, so to speak, has been there before.\\"Champlin, Charles (November 15, 1974). \\"Rattled by 'Earthquake'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote \\"Thanks to Sensurround, 'Earthquake' figures to be the gimmick hit of 1974. Without the gimmick, it would be difficult to distinguish this perfunctory, mediocre piece of storytelling from Universal's other disaster vehicle, Airport 1975.\\"Arnold, Gary (November 16, 1974). \\"In an 'Earthquake' Tremor\\". The Washington Post. B1. Rotten Tomatoes collected reviews from 26 critics, some contemporary with the film and some from subsequent years, to give the film a score of 42% with an average of 4.76 out of 10. The critical consensus reads: \\"The destruction of Los Angeles is always a welcome sight, but Earthquake offers little besides big actors slumming through crumbling sets.\\" Leonard Maltin gave the film a \\"BOMB\\" rating, stating \\"[the] title tells the story in hackneyed disaster epic ... Marjoe as a sex deviate and Gardner as Lorne Greene's daughter tie for film's top casting honors.\\" Gardner was only 8 years younger than Lorne Greene. ===Accolades=== Earthquake was nominated for four Academy Awards. including Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Alexander Golitzen and E. Preston Ames; Set Decoration: Frank R. McKelvy) and Best Sound (Ronald Pierce and Melvin Metcalfe Sr.). It won for Best Sound (Ronald Pierce and Melvin Metcalfe Sr.) and a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects (Frank Brendel, Glen Robinson and Albert Whitlock). The film was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Original Score (John Williams). The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2001: AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated ==Television version== For the film's television premiere on September 26, 1976 on NBC, additional footage was added to expand the film's running time so it could be shown over two nights. This \\"television version\\" made no use of material left out of the theatrical release (save one brief scene featuring Victoria Principal and Reb Brown), but rather incorporated new footage filmed nearly two years after the original using two of the original film's stars, Marjoe Gortner and Victoria Principal, as well as Jesse Vint and Michael Richardson (reprising their film roles of Marjoe Gortner's taunting roommates), expanding on the original storyline from the theatrical film. Editing and re-recorded dialogue helped integrate this expansion into the original film. An entirely new storyline shot specifically for the television version was that of a young married couple (Debralee Scott and Sam Chew) flying to Los Angeles on an airplane. The husband seeks a job with the Royce Construction company of the film (in fact, hoping to work with Charlton Heston's character, Stewart Graff), while his wife has the eerily accurate ability to see the future with tarot cards. Their airliner attempts to land at Los Angeles International Airport as the titular earthquake hits, and the airliner makes a touch-and-go landing on a runway that is breaking up, diverting to San Francisco. Throughout the remainder of the television version, the film cuts back to the couple as they discuss their future together, and the husband's wish to return to Los Angeles and help rebuild the city. The \\"Sensurround\\" audio of the original film was simulcast in FM stereo in the Los Angeles and New York markets. This theoretically allowed the home viewer with the properly equipped sound system to experience a similar effect as in the theater. ==Theme park attractions== Earthquake inspired the attractions Earthquake: The Big One at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. The Hollywood attraction opened in March 1989 as part of the Studio Tour tram ride. The tram enters a sound stage, the interior designed to look like a San Francisco underground BART station, whereupon a two-and-a-half- minute simulation of an 8.3 earthquake takes place, featuring a gas truck falling into the station, a runaway train and a flood. The Florida attraction opened in June 1990. It began with an introductory film on the making of Earthquake with Charlton Heston appearing to explain the special effects, followed by a live demonstration based on the film with audience participation. The attraction culminated in a simulated 8.3 earthquake aboard an underground train at Embarcadero Station in San Francisco. In the fall of 2002, the pre-show was changed to a more generic \\"magic of making movies\\" theme, with slight modifications which included mentioning special effects used in other films besides Earthquake. The Florida attraction officially closed on November 5, 2007, and reopened several months later as \\"Disaster!: A Major Motion Picture Ride...Starring You!.\\" ==Stock footage== Many scenes from the film, especially those featuring the destruction of Los Angeles, have appeared in other productions, often those of Universal Studios itself. Some examples include: * Damnation Alley: In this 1977 film, the earth shifts from its axis after a full-scale nuclear war. Flood scenes from the dam burst in Earthquake are used to help depict the earth returning to its correct axis. * Quantum Leap: The episode \\"Disco Inferno\\" has Sam Beckett leaped in as a film stuntman. One of his jobs is on the set of Earthquake, where he is the character seen hanging from a piece of debris whom Sam Royce (Lorne Greene's character) attempts to save, but Beckett loses his grip and falls. * Galactica 1980: In the episode \\"Galactica Discovers Earth\\", in a \\"computer simulation\\" of a devastating Cylon attack on Los Angeles, which was in turn shown in the Tom Petty music video for the song \\"You Got Lucky\\". * V: The Final Battle: Footage from the sequence featuring the collapse of the Hollywood dam was reused during the destruction of the Visitors water pumping station. * Barenaked Ladies music video for \\"Another Postcard\\": Parts of the film, namely when the big earthquake struck, were used. * The Incredible Hulk: In the first-season episode \\"Earthquakes Happen\\", several building collapse scenes, the collapsing freeway overpass scene, the collapsing Spanish bells, the sliding and falling stilt houses, and the collapsing high tension wires and parts of the wooden foot bridge scenes were reused with slightly zoomed or slightly reoriented focus to minimize association with Earthquake. * Scarface has a scene where Tony Montana is going to buy cocaine from some drug dealers, and the TV set in the motel room shows the scene in this film where the graduate assistant is explaining his earthquake theory to the director of the Seismology Institute. ==Notes== ==See also== * List of American films of 1974 ==References* * Disaster Films at filmsite.org * \\"Introduction to Sensurround\\" March 2004 article in the 70mm Newsletter Category:1974 films Category:1970s disaster films Category:1970s thriller drama films Category:American disaster films Category:American films Category:American survival films Category:American thriller drama films Category:English-language films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department Category:Films about earthquakes Category:Films directed by Mark Robson Category:Films scored by John Williams Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films that won the Best Sound Mixing Academy Award Category:Films that won the Best Visual Effects Academy Award Category:Films with screenplays by Mario Puzo Category:Universal Pictures films Category:1974 drama films ","title":"Earthquake (1974 film)"},{"id":"515231","text":"Diagram of a base bleed unit. The top diagram shows the bottom of the shell and the location of the gas vents. The bottom diagram is a cut-away view showing the gas generator mechanism. Base bleed is a system used on some artillery shells to increase their range, typically by about 20–35%. Since base bleed extends the range by a percentage, it is more useful on longer range artillery where an increase of approximately can be achieved. Until the late 1980s the small gains in range were not considered worthwhile for field artillery. Base bleed shells are becoming more common in units equipped with modern artillery which have far greater range than the old ones, but are usually only used at close to, and beyond, normal maximum ranges due to the higher cost per shell. == Function == Most (50–60%) of the drag on an artillery shell comes from the nose of the shell, as it pushes the air out of its way at supersonic speeds. Shaping the shell properly can reduce this drag but it is difficult to remove. However, another powerful source of drag is the low-pressure area left behind the shell due to its blunt base. Base bleed can reduce this drag without extending the base of the shell. Instead, a small ring of metal extends just past the base, and the area in the rear of the shell is filled with a small gas generator. The gas generator provides little to no thrust, but fills the vacuum in the area behind the shell with an inflow of gas, dramatically reducing the drag. The lessened turbulence also turned out to produce tighter grouping due to the projectiles having a more consistent trajectory. The only disadvantage, apart from a higher price per shell, was a small loss in explosive payload in older shells due to some of the space inside the shell being taken up by this mechanism, but modern gas generators are both smaller and incorporated in the shell casing. ==History== The principles were developed in Sweden in the mid 1960s, by the Försvarets forskningsanstalt (abbreviated FOA), and the Artillery bureau at the Kungliga Materielförvaltningen (later the Försvarets Materielverk (FMV)) while working on a rocket-assisted projectile called \\"reatil\\". Their goal was to increase the range of coastal artillery.Grenander By 1966, it had been concluded that a small, slow-burning charge at the base of the projectile would alleviate the low pressure behind the shell, hence increasing the range by lessening the difference between the pressure due to aerodynamic drag on the nose of the shell and the low pressure behind the base. The first full-scale tests took place in 1969 with modified 10.5 cm steel shells with excellent results, and the Swedish patent was granted FOA in 1971 although both application and patent were classified. Since the development was done, the patent was transferred to FMV for procurement to the armed forces of Sweden. The concept was quickly implemented into the 7.5 cm sjömålsgranat m/66 (7.5 cm anti- shipping shell m/66) used in the 7.5 cm tornpjäs m/57 fixed coastal artillery gun, and then rapidly into all anti-shipping shells in the Swedish military. Since FMV was to contract a company in the US to manufacture the gas generator for the 12 cm sjömålsgranat m/70 (12 cm anti-shipping shell m/70), used in the 12 cm TAP m/70 fixed coastal artillery gun, the classification secret was removed from the patent. Shortly thereafter the international rights were sold, eventually ending up with the Space Research Corporation (SRC), then owned by aeronautical engineer Gerald Bull. At the end of the 20th century, the technology was generally available world-wide. ==See also== * Rocket Assisted Projectile (RAP) ==References== * (in Swedish) * (in Swedish) Category:Artillery ammunition ","title":"Base bleed"},{"id":"515233","text":"Benjamin Franklin Goodrich (November 4, 1841 – August 3, 1888) was an American industrialist in the rubber industry and founder of B.F. Goodrich Company.Goodrich Corporation website ==Early life== Goodrich was born in the farming town of Ripley, New York on November 4, 1841. He was a son of Anson Goodrich (1792–1847) and Susannah (née Dinsmoor) Goodrich (born 1799). Orphaned at the age of eight, he was raised by his uncle.Goodrich Corporation website He received his M.D. from Cleveland Medical College (now Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine) in 1861, studied surgery at the University of Pennsylvania in 1863 and served as a battlefront surgeon for the Union Army in the Civil War with the rank of Captain. After a few years in a struggling medical practice, he went to work in Pennsylvania's oilfields and became a real estate speculator. ==Career== After the war, he reached a licensing agreement with Charles Goodyear and bought the Hudson River Rubber Company in partnership with J.P. Morris in 1869. The company, located in Melrose, New York, failed. The following year he accepted an offer of $13,600 from the citizens of Akron, Ohio to relocate his business there. He founded Goodrich, Tew & Co. in 1870. Goodrich bought out Tew, and in 1880 the company became the B.F. Goodrich Company. Goodrich was the first in Akron to own a telephone, which was a gift from Alexander Graham Bell in 1877. The telephone connected Goodrich's house on Quaker Street to his factory on Rubber Street. According to a story, Goodrich had seen a friend's home burn to the ground, with firefighters rendered helpless because their leather hoses had frozen and cracked. Once settled in Akron, Goodrich ordered his company to begin producing cotton-wrapped rubber hose that would resist freezing. A few years later Goodrich started selling garden hoses (allowing bucketless garden watering) and bicycle tires. Still, the company teetered near bankruptcy and went through numerous name changes, its success still uncertain when Goodrich died at the age of 46 in 1888. The business began booming at B.F. Goodrich Company a few years after Goodrich's death with the company's introduction of a pneumatic tire that could endure the speed and load of the evolving automobile. The radial tire was designed by an advertising employee in his company. Over subsequent decades, Goodrich Company chemists invented plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in 1926, synthesized rubber in 1937 and built spacesuits for NASA astronauts in the 1960s. Now renamed Goodrich Corporation, the company abandoned the tire business in 1988 and subsequently described itself as a global supplier of systems and services to the aerospace, defense, and homeland security markets. In 2012 the Goodrich Corporation was sold to United Technologies. The brand name Goodrich now appears on tires made by Michelin, which bought the Uniroyal-B. F. Goodrich tire business in 1994. ==Personal life== Portrait of his wife, by Ellen Emmet Rand, 1906. On November 4, 1869, Goodrich was married to Mary Elizabeth Marvin (1841–1907), a daughter of U.S. Representative Richard Pratt Marvin and Isabella (née Newland) Marvin. Her uncle, William Marvin, was a United States federal judge and the 7th Governor of Florida. Together, Mary and Benjamin were the parents of: * Charles Cross Goodrich (1871–1932), who was a Goodrich chemist and member of the Maine Legislature. He married Mary Anna Gellatly in 1895. * Richard Marvin Goodrich (1872–1872), who died in infancy. * Isabella Goodrich Breckinridge (1874–1961), who married John Cabell Breckinridge II (1870–1941), a grandson of John C. Breckinridge (the former Vice President of the United States under James Buchanan, a Confederate general and Confederate Secretary of War). * David Marvin Goodrich (1876–1950), who became a Goodrich executive. He married Ruth Williams Pruyn, a daughter of banker Robert C. Pruyn in 1903. They divorced and in 1936 he married Beatrice (née Morgan) Pruyn, daughter of William Fellowes Morgan Sr. and the ex-wife of his first wife's brother. Goodrich died on August 3, 1888, in Manitou Springs, Colorado, where he had been in hopes of improving his health. He was buried in at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown, New York. After his death, his wife hired architect Guy Lowell in 1905 to design a 23-room mansion known as River House in York, Maine. His widow died in April 1907. ===Descendants=== Through his daughter Isabella, he was a grandfather of Marvin Breckinridge Patterson, the photojournalist, cinematographer, and philanthropist, who married diplomat Jefferson Patterson. == References == ==External links== * *Goodrich Corporation: Doctor BF Goodrich Category:1841 births Category:1888 deaths Category:People from Ripley, New York Category:American businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Akron, Ohio Category:American Civil War surgeons Category:People from Schaghticoke, New York Category:Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine alumni Category:Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:Grand River Academy alumni ","title":"Benjamin Goodrich"},{"id":"515239","text":"Libertarianz was a political party in New Zealand (hence the suffix -nz) that advocated libertarianism, favouring self-government and limiting the power of the government over the individual. Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is a major influence on the party. Its slogan, \\"More Freedom, Less Government\\", is indicative of the party's basic policy platform. It went into recess and was deregistered by its own request in early February 2014. ==History== Libertarianz was founded in late 1995 by Ian Fraser, who served as the party's first leader. Later, Lindsay Perigo, a well-known New Zealand broadcaster for Radio New Zealand and TVNZ, assumed the leadership. Perigo was followed as leader by Peter Cresswell and then Russell Watkins. At the time of its deregistration the leader was Richard McGrath, and the Party president was Shane Pleasance. The party's first campaign was the 1996 election, the first to be held under the MMP electoral system. Libertarianz's involvement in the election produced negligible public interest.Miller, Raymond. New Zealand Politics in Transition. Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1997. p. 183 They gained 671 votes (0.03%), which placed them in 19th place. In the 1999 elections, the party performed somewhat better, gaining 5,949 votes (0.29%). This put them in 11th place, and in fourth place among the parties which did not gain seats in parliament. Libertarianz did not contest the party vote in the 2002 elections – due to an oversight, the party's bank cheque was not transmitted to the electoral authorities by the appointed time. The party was therefore able to contest the election only through individual electorate candidates. Its five candidates gained 672 votes amongst them. ===Darnton v Clark=== On 29 June 2006, Bernard Darnton filed proceedings in the High Court, suing Helen Clark for allegedly misappropriating public funds to pay for the Labour Party's pledge cards during the 2005 election. Some commentators labelled the lawsuit a stunt, although it received some media coverage as concern about the \\"pledge card\\" funding grew. The New Zealand Herald The New Zealand Herald On Sunday 10 September 2006, the lawsuit was the subject of a front-page storyFairfax New Zealand - Stuff.co.nz in The Sunday Star-Times newspaper. The Labour party promptly accused the Libertarianz party of being part of a conspiracy with National party, alleging that the small party could not afford to bring such a case to court.Yahoo!Xtra News In October 2006, after the Auditor-General released a report declaring that the misappropriation of funds was illegal, Labour and other political parties immediately announced that they would pay back the money. On 17 and 18 October, a majority, including the Labour Party, passed a law through Parliament to 'retrospectively validate' the spending, making it legal, which is required under the Public Finance Act 1989. In the circumstances, however, it also effectively makes the misspending immune from court proceedings. In response, the Libertarianz party declared 18 October 2006 to be \\"Banana Republic Day\\", and issued press releases. ===Dissolution (2014)=== In February 2014, Party Leader Richard McGrath asked the Electoral Commission to deregister the party, given that practical administrative tasks such as maintaining membership were rendered impossible by the part-time and voluntary status of its membership and executive. Instead, McGrath advised former party members to support ACT New Zealand, under the organisational leadership of newly elected party president Jamie Whyte. ==Election results (1996–2011)== { class= - !

Produced by Carlos and Rachel Elkind, the album is a collection of pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach performed by Carlos and Benjamin Folkman on a Moog synthesizer. It played a key role in bringing synthesizers to popular music, which had until then been mostly used in experimental music. Switched- On Bach reached number 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart and topped the Billboard Classical Albums chart from 1969 to 1972. By June 1974, it had sold over one million copies, and in 1986 became the second classical album to be certified platinum. In 1970, it won Grammy Awards for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. == Background == Around 1967, Carlos asked the musician Rachel Elkind to listen to her electronic compositions. They included compositions written ten years earlier, and some written from 1964 with her friend Benjamin Folkman at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City. One recording was a rendition of Two-Part Invention in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach, which Carlos described as \\"charming\\". Soon after, Carlos began plans to produce an album of Bach pieces performed on the recently invented Moog synthesizer, with the intention of using the novel technology to make \\"appealing music you could really listen to\\", not \\"ugly\\" music being produced by avant-garde musicians at the time. Elkind was impressed with the recording of Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G major and became the album's producer. Elkind contacted her friend, producer and conductor Ettore Stratta at Columbia Records, who \\"generously spread his enthusiasm throughout the rest of the company\\" and assisted in the album production. Paul Myers of Columbia Masterworks Records granted Carlos, Folkman, and Elkind artistic freedom to record and release it. == Recording == Switched-On Bach features ten pieces by Bach available under the public domain, performed by Carlos, with assistance from Folkman, on a Moog synthesizer. Carlos worked closely with Moog designer Robert Moog, testing his components and suggesting improvements. The album was recorded in a studio in the basement of a brownstone building acquired by Carlos and Elkind in the West Side of Manhattan in New York City, using a custom-built 8-track recording machine constructed by Carlos from components built by Ampex. According to Carlos, Switched-On Bach took approximately five months and one thousand hours to produce. As the synthesizers were monophonic, meaning only one note can be played at a time, each track was assembled one at a time. Carlos said: \\"You had to release the note before you could make the next note start, which meant you had to play with a detached feeling on the keyboard, which was really very disturbing in making music.\\" The synthesizer was unreliable and often went out of tune; Carlos recalled hitting it with a hammer prior to recording to obtain correct levels. After several notes were played, it was checked again to make sure it had not drifted. Bach provided only two chords for the second movement of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major, intending that the musician would improvise on these chords. Carlos carefully constructed this piece to showcase the capabilities of the Moog. == Artwork == Switched-On Bach was released with two different covers. The most common features a man dressed as Bach standing before a Moog synthesizer. Early pressings feature the same man seated. Carlos and Elkind objected to the original cover and had it replaced, finding it \\"was a clownish, trivializing image of a mugging Bach, supposedly hearing some absurd sound from his earphones\\". They also objected to the fact that the synthesizer was incorrectly set up: \\"[The earphones] were plugged into the input, not output, of a 914 filter module, which in turn was connected to nothing, [assuring] that silence is all that would have greeted Johann Sebastian's ears.\\"Switched- On Boxed Set liner notes == Release == In 1968, shortly before the release of Switched-On Bach, Moog spoke at the annual Audio Engineering Society conference and played one of Carlos' recordings from the album. Moog recalled: \\"I walked off the stage and went to the back of the auditorium while people were listening, and I could feel it in the air. They were jumping out of their skins. These technical people were involved in so much flim-flam, so much shoddy, opportunistic stuff, and here was something that was just impeccably done and had obvious musical content and was totally innovative. The tape got a standing ovation.\\"Robert Moog, quoted in Vintage Synthesizers by Mark Vail (Miller Freeman, Inc.) Switched-On Bach was released in October 1968. In 1969, it entered the top 40 on the US Billboard 200 before it reached a peak of No. 10 that year, for a total of 59 weeks on the chart. From January 1969 to January 1972, the album was No. 1 on the Billboard Classical Albums chart. In February 1974, Columbia Records estimated 960,000 copies of the album had been sold in the US. In June that year, Billboard reported the album's sales surpassed one million, the second classical music record in history to achieve the feat. In August 1969, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for sales in excess of 1 million copies. It reached Platinum certification in November 1986. === Reception === Switched-On Bach was met with a negative response from some classical music traditionalists, but gained popularity among many younger listeners. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Bruce Eder noted that Carlos' approach \\"was highly musical in ways that ordinary listeners could appreciate ... characterized by ... amazing sensitivity and finely wrought nuances, in timbre, tone, and expressiveness.\\" Canadian pianist Glenn Gould spoke highly of Switched-On Bach, saying: \\"The whole record, in fact, is one of the most startling achievements of the recording industry in this generation and certainly one of the great feats in the history of 'keyboard' performance\\". In 1970, the album won three Grammy Awards: Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. === Influence === Following the album's success, Moog received requests from producers and artists for his synthesizers and a number of synthesizer albums were released to capitalise. Notable examples of this trend include Switched-On Rock by the Moog Machine, and Music to Moog By by Gershon Kingsley, both released in 1969. Moog credited the album for demonstrating that synthesizers could be used for more than avant-garde music and sound effects. He said of the album's success: In 1972 Columbia Records released an orchestral album, Switched Off Bach, with the same track listing as Switched- On Bach.https://www.amazon.com/Switched-Off-Bach/dp/B00U88894I The musician and producer Giorgio Moroder credits the album for bringing synthesizers to his attention. It was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2005. === Reissues === In 1992, Carlos released Switched-On Bach 2000 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her first album, featuring a re-recording of the record using digital synthesizers and computer-assisted recording with an added introductory composition styled as a birthday fanfare for the project. Switched-On Bach was remastered and included as part of the Switched- On Boxed Set, a four-CD box set released in 1999 with The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, Switched-On Bach II, and Switched-On Brandenburgs. In 2001, a remastered edition of Switched-On Bach was released with a previously unreleased track, \\"Initial Experiments, demonstration\\".

Two prototypes were constructed, but the project was abandoned without the aircraft entering production. Elements of its design were incorporated into later Junkers aircraft. ==Development== From the very beginnings of the Luftwaffe in 1933, General Walther Wever, the chief of staff, realised the importance that strategic bombing would play in any future conflict. A Langstrecken-Grossbomber (\\"long-range big bomber\\") was needed to fulfill this role. Under the Ural bomber programme, he began secret talks with two of Nazi Germany's leading aircraft manufacturers - Dornier and Junkers - requesting designs for a long-range bomber. The two companies responded with the Dornier Do 19 and the Junkers Ju 89, respectively, and the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) ordered prototypes for both aircraft in 1935. The RLM request asked for two prototypes and a prototype series of nine aircraft. The Ju 89 and its competitor, the Dornier Do 19, both proved promising, but fell victim to a change of direction within the Luftwaffe. Wever was killed in a plane crash in 1936. His successors – Albert Kesselring, Ernst Udet, and Hans Jeschonnek – favoured smaller, tactical aircraft, since they could be used to support army operations; they also did not require as much material and manpower. They were proponents of the dive bomber (Ju 87 Stuka) and the doctrine of close support and destruction of the opposing airforces on the battle-ground rather than through attacking enemy industry. They convinced Hermann Göring by emphasising the need for tactical bombers to act in an army support role. While their beliefs seemed validated by Germany's early successes in the Blitzkrieg, the lack of strategic bombing capability severely hampered the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain and Operation Barbarossa. ===First prototype=== On 11 April 1937, the Ju 89 prototype D-AFIT (V1, c/n 4911) was first flown by Hesselbach. Just 2½ weeks after the first flight, on 29 April 1937, the further development of both strategic bombers was cancelled by the RLM. The reason for this step was the high fuel consumption of heavy bombers, as well as because a large number of bombers could only be manufactured if these bombers were medium bombers, like the Ju 88. ===Second prototype=== Junkers completed the second Ju 89 prototype D-ALAT July 1937. Junkers used both prototypes for extensive flight tests to get experience of the stability and flight controls of large aircraft, but the third prototype V3 was stopped after the programme was cancelled. On 4 June 1938, Junkers achieved a new payload/altitude world record with the second prototype D-ALAT with payload at an altitude of , ( more than a Short Stirling with the same payload). On 8 June 1938, D-ALAT reached an altitude of with . In late 1938, both aircraft were transferred to the Luftwaffe, where they were used as heavy transport aircraft. Both Ju 89 prototypes seem to have been scrapped by the end of 1939, although some sources claim that they were still in use the following year in Norway. During testing, Luft Hansa expressed an interest in an airliner to be developed from the type, which led Junkers to rebuild the incomplete third prototype as the Ju 90. ==Specifications (Ju 89 V2)== thumb ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * WW2 in Color Category:1930s German bomber aircraft Category:World War II heavy bombers of Germany Category:Abandoned military aircraft projects of Germany Ju 089 Category:Four-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1937 Category:Four-engined piston aircraft ","title":"Junkers Ju 89"},{"id":"515250","text":"Soil compactor A compactor is a machine or mechanism used to reduce the size of material such as waste material or bio mass through compaction. A trash compactor is often used by a home or business to reduce the volume of trash it produces. A baler-wrapper compactor is often used for making compact and wrapped bales in order to improve logistics. Normally powered by hydraulics, compactors take many shapes and sizes. In landfill sites for example, a large tractor (typically a converted front end loader with some variant of a bulldozer blade attached) with spiked steel wheels called a landfill compactor is used to drive over waste deposited by waste collection vehicles (WCVs). WCVs themselves incorporate a compacting mechanism which is used to increase the payload of the vehicle and reduce the number of times it has to empty. This usually takes the form of hydraulically powered sliding plates which sweep out the collection hopper and compress the material into what has already been loaded. Different compactors are used in scrap metal processing, the most familiar being the car crusher. Such devices can be of either the \\"pancake\\" type, where a scrap automobile is flattened by a huge descending hydraulically powered plate, or the baling press, where the automobile is compressed from several directions until it resembles a large cube. ==Commercial use== Landfill compactor Many retail and service businesses, such as fast food, restaurants, and hotels, use compactors to reduce the volume of non-recyclable waste as well as curb nuisance such as rodents and smell. In the hospitality industry tolerance for such nuisances is particularly low. These compactors typically come in electric and hydraulic operation, with quite a few loading configurations. Most popular loading configurations fall under the following: * Ground-access; * Walk-on; * Secured indoor chute. These compactors are almost exclusively of welded steel construction for two reasons: durability under pressure and exposure to the elements, as compactors are installed either completely outdoors or sometimes under a covered loading dock. == Agricultural use == Agricultural baler-wrapper compactor As a means to preserve and store forage, baler-wrapper compactors are used to exclude oxygen from the forage and wrap it in air tight film. Without access to air the forage is preserved fresh for longer periods of time. ==Residential use== A solar trash compactor on a residential corner in Jersey City, New Jersey. There are also trash compactors, hydraulic or manual, designed for residential use. Likewise, they reduce the volume of garbage. For example, some compactors reduce the volume of polystyrene to 1/30. ==Municipal use== In addition to the waste vehicle and landfill use, there are solar-powered trash compactors that can hold the equivalent of 200 gallons of trash before they need to be emptied.Solar Compactors Make Mincemeat of Trash, All Things Considered, NPR, July 17, 2007 The large compactors in garbage trucks can be dangerous for workers, and played a role in the US Civil Rights Movement. The 1968 Memphis sanitation strike took place when two sanitation workers were crushed to death in garbage compactors, after which 700 of their 1300 black coworkers decided to strike. == Recycling and energy == Baler-wrapper compactors are used for efficient storage and transport of materials like RDF (refuse-derived fuel) and bin waste, as well as compost and saw dust, enabling higher rates of recycling. ==Construction industry== In construction, there are three main types of compactor: the plate, the rammer, and the road roller. The roller type compactors are used for compacting crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor, vibrating plate, or tamper, has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the rammer compactor has a smaller foot. The rammer, or trench rammer, is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have vibrating rollers. In plates and rollers the vibration is provided by rapidly rotating eccentric masses. In smaller plates the vibration causes a tendency to move forwards, while some larger plates are provided with a directional control. In the rammer the foot is mounted on a sleeve that slides vertically in the leg. Inside the sleeve, a piston is driven up and down by the engine through a reduction gear, crank and connecting rod. Substantial coil springs above and below the piston connect it to the sliding sleeve. The connection between the sleeve and foot is at small angle so that the whole rammer leans away from the operator. The vibrating motion is therefore slightly off the vertical, and this gives the rammer a tendency to 'walk' forwards. The sliding joint in the leg is protected by a flexible bellows. In England the name \\"wacker plate\\" or just \\"wacker\\" is commonly used to refer to plate compactors, derived from the name of Wacker Neuson, a well-known manufacturer of such devices. The name is pronounced in the English style as whacker as opposed to the correct German vacker. A rammer is colloquially referred to as \\"Paddy's Motorbike\\", due to the traditional resource of Irish construction labourers, and the way that the operator appears to \\"ride\\" the hammer holding the handles like a motorcycle.

After a stint shooting with photographer Mario Testino for fashion magazines such as Vogue, Miller began working for both companies in 2002. In 2007, she became a Victoria's Secret Angel, and appeared on the cover of the 2008 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue to record-setting numbers. Her accomplishments have led to her being dubbed the \\"return of the great American supermodel.\\" She is known for contracts with companies such as Harley-Davidson, for whom she is the first spokesperson in the history of the company, and the NFL, for whom she became a spokesperson in 2010. Miller is considered a sex symbol; she ranked No. 1 on Maxim magazine's 2008 \\"Hot 100\\" list and in FHM's global 2010 \\"Sexiest Women in the World\\" poll. Aside from modeling, she was an ambassador for both the American Cancer Society and the USO. Miller made her film debut in R.I.P.D. (2013). ==Early life== Miller was born as Marisa Lee Bertetta in Santa Cruz, California, to Krista (née Useldinger) and Marc Bertetta. She has two younger sisters. Miller attended high school at Aptos High and Monte Vista Christian School. She considered herself a tomboy growing up, with mostly male friends and little awareness of anything girly. Out of shyness, she often wore large t-shirts to hide her body and would get fully dressed just to go to the trash-can while at the beach. Miller was first \\"discovered\\" at age sixteen walking through a San Francisco café by two Italian modeling agents. After talking to her mother, she was on a plane to Italy with her mother a few months later, despite her \\"shy and conservative\\" personality. During the 1990's, fashion modelling was going through a phase of the androgynous look, and Marisa thought herself too curvy and too short to fit that trend. Miller gained attention in 1997 when she appeared nude in the first issue of Perfect 10 magazine. Although she came in third behind Ashley Degenford and Monica Hansen in Perfect 10 magazine's first annual model search, she was repeatedly showcased in following issues, including the covers of the Winter 1998 and August/September 1999 editions, as well as a reprint for the Fall 2004 edition cover.Perfect 10 magazine cover.

By 2002 Miller was working for Victoria's Secret and appearing in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, in which she appeared in every issue from 2002 to 2008. In particular, she famously posed wearing only an iPod in the 2007 issue. She has appeared in a diverse range of magazines, many of them international editions, such as GQ, Maxim, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Elle, and Vanity Fair. She has appeared in advertisements for Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, Andrew Marc, Victoria's Secret, J.Crew, Guess?, Nordstrom, Bath & Body Works, and True Religion jeans. It was not until 2007 that she filmed her first television commercial for Victoria's Secret, appearing alongside Heidi Klum for the It bra. On December 4, 2007, Miller made her debut in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and opened a segment in the following year's edition. Other runway work include 2007's Fashion for Relief show, benefiting victims of Hurricane Katrina, as well as MTV's Fashionably Loud, Imitation of Christ, Inca, and Amir Slama's Rosa Cha, for which she was one of the most anticipated models. In the February 12, 2008, episode of the Late Show with David Letterman, it was revealed via a three-story billboard in New York City that Miller would occupy the cover of that year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The tandem online launch of the issue drew record page views to the SI website: 228 million, a 41% increase over 2007. In September 2008, Sports Illustrated released a \\"Best of Marisa Miller\\" swimsuit calendar for the 2009 year. Victoria's Secret put her to work in 2008, with a five-city tour to promote the 2008 Swim collection's release in stores; the April–May tour included stops in New York City, Miami, Chicago (where she threw the opening pitch at a Chicago Cubs baseball game), Boston, and Minneapolis. The relaunch of Victoria Secret's sports line, VSX, soon followed, along with her first official campaign as an Angel: promoting the company's fragrance Very Sexy Dare. For the 2009 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, Miller was chosen to wear the year's \\"Fantasy Bra,\\" a harlequin design featuring 2,300 white, champagne, and cognac diamonds, and a 16-carat heart-shaped brown-yellow diamond pendant for a $3-million value and 150 total carats. In response to claims that Miller had parted with Victoria's Secret in January 2010, the Chief Marketing Officer for Limited Brands responded, saying the claims were \\"unfounded and untrue\\" while adding \\"we adore Marisa and we will continue to work with her in the future.\\" In late 2010, Miller confirmed she had moved on to other projects. ===Beyond modeling=== In a July 2010 interview with Forbes, Miller explained her shift in focus from modelling to becoming a celebrity brand herself. For that reason, she moved to promoting consumer products in line with her own brand and personality. In July 2008, Miller launched a line of shoes she had developed with skateboarder/surfer-oriented company Vans . Miller starred in a 2008 viral video on YouTube with All Star baseball player Ryan Braun for Remington's ShortCut hair clippers In 2008, Miller became the first spokesperson in motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson's one-hundred-year history. She first partnered with Harley to launch the VRSCF V-Rod Muscle motorcycle and rejoined the company in November 2009 to act as the face of their first \\"Military Appreciation Month\\" campaign, featuring Miller as a classic pin-up in military-themed advertisements and online content. 2010 found her again working for the company, this time for their \\"Start Something\\" campaign, encouraging dreamers to become new riders. Miller represented the rum brand Captain Morgan as the company's \\"Official First Mate\\" in advertising, social responsibility communication, and event appearances, starting in 2010. In October 2010, the NFL announced Miller had been hired as a spokesperson for the 2010-2011 season, with duties including hosting the NFL International Series game between the San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos in London. The announcement drew accusations toward the league of sending a \\"mixed message\\" in hiring a well-known lingerie and swimsuit model on the heels of controversies over reporter Ines Sainz's treatment at the New York Jets' facilities and the messages and photos Brett Favre allegedly sent Jenn Sterger. New York Times columnist William C. Rhoden noted that \\"Miller reveals a lot of flesh in the N.F.L. advertisements featuring her. This is Miller’s business, but it shouldn’t be the N.F.L.’s.\\" In 2010, she designed and released a paddle board line with Surftech aimed at female riders and in 2012 she appeared in a beach-theme commercial for Buick. Miller's first work in television was as a judge on the Bravo reality series Manhunt: The Search for America's Most Gorgeous Male Model in 2004, the same year she appeared in Puddle of Mudd's \\"Spin You Around\\" music video. 2007 brought appearances in the pilot episode and finale of the VH1 reality show The Shot and cameos in HBO's Entourage and the CBS comedy How I Met Your Mother, the latter with her fellow Victoria's Secret Angels. In 2009, she had a guest judge role on an episode of America's Next Top Model and a minor role in an episode of Gary Unmarried; in 2010, she co-hosted an episode of GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley. She has appeared in commercials for the NFL Network and the California Travel and Tourism Commission's \\"Visit California\\" campaign. Miller's 2008 commercial for Activision's Guitar Hero: World Tour, was deemed too sexy to air. The advert was part of a campaign featuring various celebrities, and was based on the famous scene from Risky Business where Tom Cruise dances to Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" in a shirt and underwear. Miller's first film role was in R.I.P.D. (2013), with Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges. ==FilmographyFilm=== { class = \\" sortable\\" - ! Year ! Title ! Role !

This marked the first time anyone has debuted on the list in the number one position. In her subsequent cover story for the July issue, Maxim proclaimed her as the \\"return of the great American supermodel.\\" Of such acclaim, Miller admits, \\"I get a kick out of it, but it would be stupid to let it go to my head. It’s modeling—I didn’t find the cure for cancer.\\" Miller continued to be highly rated and appeared on the list in 2009 in 18th place, and in 2010 in 10th place. 10\\\\.

In 2010, Miller came in third in FHM magazine's UK edition of the 16th annual \\"Sexiest Women in the World\\" poll, placing behind actress Megan Fox and winner, British singer Cheryl Cole. Miller topped the poll in the US edition of FHM and was declared the global winner of the poll, receiving the most combined votes from FHM's 24 international editions. ==Personal life== Miller in 2020 She married Jim Miller, a Los Angeles surfing contest promoter and lifeguard from California, in 2000. The couple separated in 2002; they divorced soon after. Following the divorce, Marisa continued using the surname Miller. She married music producer Griffin Guess on April 15, 2006. Miller gave birth to the couple's son, Gavin Lee Guess, on December 13, 2012. She gave birth to the couple's second son, Grayson Lee Bazyl Guess, on May 29, 2015. From an early age she loved surfing, and her aunt was on the pro tour. In 2004, she placed second in the celebrity division of the Kelly Slater Surf Invitational and says of the sport, \\"I feel my absolute best—physically, mentally and spiritually—when I'm surfing every day.\\" She also won the most valuable player award at the 4th annual Celebrity Beach Bowl. She was a standout volleyball player in high school and has taken up boxing. After signing with Harley-Davidson, Miller received her motorcycle license and rides a Harley Nightster. She has said that she would like to be a sportscaster. Miller comes from a family of nurses. Her mother returned to college to become a pediatrics nurse and her sisters are also nurses. She has expressed an interest in following the same career path if she stops modeling. As of 2009, Miller is an ambassador for the American Cancer Society.Coyte, Matt. \\"A Model Citizen\\" (Faces of Change inset), Rolling Stone Magazine, July 2009. Proceeds from her online store are donated to the charity. She also supports the Young Survival Coalition, which raises awareness of breast cancer in women under 40, as well as environmental organization the Surfrider Foundation, which aims to preserve the world's oceans and beaches. In 2014 she was honored with the inaugural Paul Walker Ocean Leadership Award. In October 2009, Miller hosted the Monte Foundation music festival, an annual fundraiser for schools in the Aptos area, where she and Guess own a home. She is also an ambassador for the USO; she visits military bases and receives frequent fan mail from American troops worldwide. In May 2015, Miller posed while pregnant with her second child as part of a PETA campaign against SeaWorld's practice of separating baby orca from their mothers. ==ReferencesMagazines=== * Marisa Miller in Sports Illustrated, published by Time Inc. ** Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, 2003 - 2006 ** Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, 2007 ** Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, 2008 ==External links== * * * Category:1978 births Category:Female models from California Category:American film actresses Category:American television actresses Category:Harley-Davidson people Category:Living people Category:Actresses from Santa Cruz, California Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Actresses of Italian descent Category:People from Aptos, California Category:Victoria's Secret Angels ","title":"Marisa Miller"},{"id":"515255","text":"Sitkwin (, BGN/PCGN: sitkwin) is a small town in Minhla Township, Bago Region, of Myanmar. ==Important events== February 7, 1998: Bertrand Piccard and Crew arrived with their Breitling Orbiter balloon.

Balsam (from Latin balsamum \\"gum of the balsam tree\\", ultimately from Semitic, Aramaic busma, Arabic balsam and Hebrew basam, \\"spice\\", \\"perfume\\") owes its name to the biblical Balm of Gilead. Balsamum tolutanum, Myroxylon balsamum Myroxylon, the source of Balsam of Peru and Balsam of Tolu, is a genus of tree grown in Central America and South America. Pictured Myroxylon peruiferum. == Chemistry == Balsam is a solution of plant-specific resins in plant-specific solvents (essential oils). Such resins can include resin acids, esters, or alcohols. The exudate is a mobile to highly viscous liquid and often contains crystallized resin particles. Over time and as a result of other influences the exudate loses its liquidizing components or gets chemically converted into a solid material (i.e. by autoxidation). Some authors require balsams to contain benzoic or cinnamic acid or their esters. Plant resins are sometimes classified according to other plant constituents in the mixture, for example as: * pure resins (guaiac, hashish), * gum-resins (containing gums/polysaccharides), * oleo-gum-resins (a mixture of gums, resins and essential oils), * oleo-resins (a mixture of resins and essential oils, e. g. capsicum, ginger and aspidinol), * balsams (resinous mixtures that contain cinnamic and/or benzoic acid or their esters), * glycoresins (podophyllin, jalap, kava kava), * fossil resins (amber, asphaltite, Utah resin). Usually, animal secretions (musk, shellac, beeswax) are excluded from this definition. == The Balsam of Matariyya == The Balsam of Matariyya was a substance famous as a panacea among physicians in the Middle East and Europe during the Antique and Medieval periods. The substance has long been used as a medicine, with early references to the substance recorded as far back as 285 BC. The Balsam of Matariyya was said to be derived from an Egyptian plant and is sometimes also referred to as the balm of Gilead or the balm of Mecca. == List of balsams == * Acaroid resin (Xanthorrhoea sp.) * Acouchi balsam (Protium sp.) * Ammoniacum * Asafoetida (Laser) * Balm of Gilead * Balm of Mecca * Balsam fir - Abies balsamea * Balsam of Peru * Balsam of Tolu * Balsam Specific * Bisabol * Bdellium * Benzoin resin * Bukhoor * Cabreuva balsam (Myrocarpus frondosus, Myrocarpus fastigatus) * Camphor * Canada balsam * Chinese lacquer (Japanese lacquer) * Copaiba balsam * Copal * Corneiba balsam (Schinus terebinthifolius or Lithraea brasiliensis) * Damar * Dragon's blood (Calamus draco) * Elemi * Frankincense (Olibanum) * Galbanum * Guayac (Guaiacum officinale) * Guggul * Gurjun balsam * Imbauba balsam (Cecropia adenopus) * Labdanum * Mastic * Myrrh * Obira balsam (Apocynaceae) * Opopanax * Umiri balsam (Humiria floribunda) * Rosin (Colophony) * Sagapenum * Sandarac * Sarcocolla * Storax balsam * Turpentine * Venice turpentine (Larch turpentine) (Larix europaea) * Wallaba balsam (Eperua sp.) == Safety == Some balsams, such as Balsam of Peru, may be associated with allergies.

Buddhist adoption in Asia, Mahayana Buddhism first entered China through Silk Road during the Kushan Era. Greco-Buddhism, or Graeco-Buddhism, is the cultural syncretism between Hellenistic culture and Buddhism, which developed between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE in Bactria (modern day Afghanistan) and the Indian subcontinent. It was a cultural consequence of a long chain of interactions begun by Greek forays into India from the time of Alexander the Great. The Macedonian satraps then conquered by the Mauryan Empire, under the reign of Chandragupta Maurya. The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka would convert to Buddhism and spread the religious philosophy throughout his domain, as recorded in the Edicts of Ashoka. Following the collapse of the Mauryan Empire, Greco-Buddhism continued to flourish under the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdoms, and Kushan Empire. Mahayana Buddhism was spread from Sanchi amd Mathura in India into Gandhara and then Central Asia during the Mauryan Era, where it became the most prevalent branch of Buddhism in Central Asia. Mahayana Buddhism was later transmitted through the Silk Road into the Han Dynasty during the Kushan Era under the reign of Emperor Kanishka. ==Historical outline== Indo-Greek territory. The introduction of Hellenistic Greece started when Alexander the Great conquered the Achaemenid Empire and further regions of Central Asia in 334 BCE. Alexander would then venture into Punjab (land of five rivers), which was conquered by Darius the Great before him. Alexander crossed the Indus and Jhelum River when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the Battle of the Hydaspes. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the Beas River when confronted by the Nanda Empire, thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely. Alexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the Amu Darya and Bactria, and Greek settlements further extended to the Khyber Pass, Gandhara (see Taxila), and the Punjab. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323 BCE, the Diadochi or \\"successors\\" founded their own kingdoms. General Seleucus set up the Seleucid Empire in Anatolia and Central Asia and extended as far as India. The Mauryan Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya, would first conquer the Nanda Empire. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the Seleucid-Mauryan War. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the Indus Valley and Gandhara to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained. The Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the largest Indian empire. Following the destructive Kalinga War, Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place. As ascribed in the Edicts of Ashoka, the Emperor spread Dharma as Buddhism throughout his empire. Ashoka claims to have converted many, including the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism: The decline and overthrow of the Mauryans by the Shunga Empire, and of the revolt of Bactria in the Seleucid Empire led to the formation of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BCE). The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BCE – CE 10). Even though the region was conquered by the Indo-Scythians and the Kushan Empire (1st–3rd centuries CE), Buddhism continued to thrive. Buddhism in India was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as Bengal largely ended during the Islamic invasions of India. ==Cultural interaction== The length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane. ===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331–325 BCE)=== \\"Victory coin\\" of Alexander the Great, minted in Babylon , following his campaigns in India. Obverse: Alexander being crowned by Nike. Reverse: Alexander attacking King Porus on his elephant. Silver. British Museum. When Alexander invaded Bactria and Gandhara, these areas may already have been under Sramanic influence, likely Buddhist and Jain. According to a legend preserved in the Pali Canon, two merchant brothers from Kamsabhoga in Bactria, Tapassu and Bhallika, visited Gautama Buddha and became his disciples. The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.Foltz, Religions of the Silk Road, p. 43 In 326 BCE, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as Taxiles, surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander. Alexander fought an epic battle against King Porus of Pauravas in the Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BCE. ===Mauryan empire (322–183 BC)=== The Indian emperor Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, reconquered around 322 BC the northwest Indian territory that had been lost to Alexander the Great. However, contacts were kept with his Greco- Iranian neighbours in the Seleucid Empire. Emperor Seleucus I Nicator came to a marital agreement as part of a peace treaty,\\"The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. He crossed the Indus and waged war with Sandrocottus [Chandragupta], king of the Indians, who dwelt on the banks of that stream, until they came to an understanding with each other and contracted a marriage relationship. Some of these exploits were performed before the death of Antigonus and some afterward.\\" Appian History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55 and several Greeks, such as the historian Megasthenes, resided at the Mauryan court. The Hellenistic Pataliputra capital, discovered in Pataliputra, capital of the Maurya Empire, dated to the 3rd century BC. Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka embraced the Buddhist faith and became a great proselytizer in the line of the traditional Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism, insisting on non-violence to humans and animals (ahimsa), and general precepts regulating the life of lay people. According to the Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in GreekFor an English translation of the Greek edicts: and some in Aramaic, the official language of the Achaemenids, he sent Buddhist emissaries to the Greek lands in Asia and as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts name each of the rulers of the Hellenistic period: Ashoka also claims he converted to Buddhism Greek populations within his realm: Finally, some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as the famous Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (\\"Yona\\") Buddhist monks active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII), founding the eponymous Dharmaguptaka school of Buddhism. ===Greek presence in Bactria (325–125 BC)=== Greco-Bactrian city of Ai-Khanoum (–145 BC) was located at the doorstep of India. Alexander had established in Bactria several cities (Ai- Khanoum, Bagram) and an administration that were to last more than two centuries under the Seleucid Empire and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, all the time in direct contact with Indian territory. The Greeks sent ambassadors to the court of the Maurya Empire, such as the historian Megasthenes under Chandragupta Maurya, and later Deimachus under his son Bindusara, who reported extensively on the civilization of the Indians. Megasthenes sent detailed reports on Indian religions, which were circulated and quoted throughout the Classical world for centuries:Surviving fragments of Megasthenes:Full text The Greco-Bactrians maintained a strong Hellenistic culture at the door of India during the rule of the Maurya Empire in India, as exemplified by the archaeological site of Ai-Khanoum. When the Maurya Empire was toppled by the Shunga Empire around 180 BC, the Greco-Bactrians expanded into India, where they established the Indo-Greek Kingdom, under which Buddhism was able to flourish. ===Indo-Greek Kingdom and Buddhism (180 BC – AD 10)=== Greek Gods and the \\"Wheel of the Law\\" or Dharmachakra: Left: Zeus holding Nike, who hands a victory wreath over a Dharmachakra (coin of Menander II). Right: Divinity wearing chlamys and petasus pushing a Dharmachakra, with legend \\"He who sets in motion the Wheel of the Law\\" (Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin). The Greco- Bactrians conquered parts of North India from 180 BC, whence they are known as the Indo-Greeks. They controlled various areas of the northern Indian territory until AD 10\\\\. Buddhism prospered under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to protect the Buddhist faith from the religious persecutions of the Shungas (185–73 BC), who had overthrown the Mauryans. Zarmanochegas was a śramana (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo, Cassius Dio and Nicolaus of Damascus traveled to Antioch and Athens while Augustus (died AD 14) was ruling the Roman Empire.Strabo, xv, 1, on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73).Dio Cassius, liv, 9. Coinage The coins of the Indo-Greek king Menander I (reigned 160–135 BC), found from Afghanistan to central India, bear the inscription \\"Saviour King Menander\\" in Greek on the front. Several Indo-Greek kings after Menander, such as Zoilos I, Strato I, Heliokles II, Theophilos, Peukolaos, Menander II and Archebius display on their coins the title \\"Maharajasa Dharmika\\" (lit. \\"King of the Dharma\\") in Prakrit written in Kharoshthi. Some of the coins of Menander I and Menander II incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight-spoked wheel, associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess Nike. According to the Milinda Pañha, at the end of his reign Menander I became a Buddhist arhat,Extract of the Milinda Panha: \\"And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to Arahatship!\\" (The Questions of King Milinda, Translation by T. W. Rhys Davids, 1890) a fact also echoed by Plutarch, who explains that his relics were shared and enshrined.Plutarch on Menander: \\"But when one Menander, who had reigned graciously over the Bactrians, died afterwards in the camp, the cities indeed by common consent celebrated his funerals; but coming to a contest about his relics, they were difficultly at last brought to this agreement, that his ashes being distributed, everyone should carry away an equal share, and they should all erect monuments to him.\\" (Plutarch, \\"Political Precepts\\" Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6) p147–148 Full text A coin of Menander I (r.160–135 BC) with a dharmacakra and a palm. The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant in Indo-Greek coinage may also have been associated with Buddhism, as suggested by the parallel between coins of Antialcidas and Menander II, where the elephant in the coins of Antialcidas holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coins of Menander II. When the Zoroastrian Indo-Parthian Kingdom invaded North India in the 1st century AD, they adopted a large part of the symbolism of Indo-Greek coinage, but refrained from ever using the elephant, suggesting that its meaning was not merely geographical. Vitarka Mudra gestures on Indo-Greek coinage. Top: Divinities Tyche and Zeus. Bottom: Depiction of the Indo-Greek kings Nicias and Menander II. Finally, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as Amyntas Nikator, Nicias, Peukolaos, Hermaeus, Hippostratos and Menander II, depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka mudra (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of Buddha's teaching. Cities According to Ptolemy, Greek cities were founded by the Greco-Bactrians in northern India. Menander established his capital in Sagala (modern Sialkot, Punjab, Pakistan) one of the centers of the blossoming Buddhist culture.Milinda Panha, Chap. I A large Greek city built by Demetrius and rebuilt by Menander has been excavated at the archaeological site of Sirkap near Taxila, where Buddhist stupas were standing side-by-side with Hindu and Greek temples, indicating religious tolerance and syncretism. Scriptures Evidence of direct religious interaction between Greek and Buddhist thought during the period include the Milinda Pañha or \\"Questions of Menander\\", a Pali-language discourse in the Platonic style held between Menander I and the Buddhist monk Nagasena. According to the Mahavamsa, the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, was dedicated by a 30,000-strong Yona delegation from Alexandria on the Caucasus around 130 BC. The Mahavamsa, chapter 29, records that during Menander's reign, a Greek thera (elder monk) named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \\"the Greek city of Alexandria\\" (possibly Alexandria on the Caucasus, around north of today's Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of a stupa, indicating that Buddhism flourished in Menander's territory and that Greeks took a very active part in it. Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek meridarch (civil governor of a province) named Theodorus, describing in Kharosthi how he enshrined relics of the Buddha. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BC. Finally, Buddhist tradition recognizes Menander as one of the great benefactors of the faith, together with Ashoka and Kanishka the Great. Buddhist manuscripts in cursive Greek have been found in Afghanistan, praising various Buddhas and including mentions of the Mahayana figure of \\"Lokesvararaja Buddha\\" (). These manuscripts have been dated later than the 2nd century AD.Nicholas Sims-Williams, \\"A Bactrian Buddhist Manuscript\\" ===Kushan empire (1st–3rd century AD)=== The Kushan Empire, one of the five tribes of the Yuezhi, settled in Bactria around 125 BC, displacing the Greco-Bactrians and invading the northern parts of Pakistan and India from around AD 1\\\\. By that time they had already been in contact with Greek culture and the Indo-Greek kingdoms for more than a century. They used the Greek script to write their language, as exemplified by their coins and their adoption of the Greek alphabet. Hellenistic culture in the Indian subcontinent: Greek clothes, amphoras, wine and music. Detail from Chakhil-i- Ghoundi Stupa, Hadda, Gandhara, 1st century AD. The Kushan King Kanishka, who honored Zoroastrian, Greek and Brahmanic deities as well as the Buddha and was famous for his religious syncretism, convened the Fourth Buddhist council around 100 in Kashmir in order to redact the Sarvastivadin canon. Some of Kanishka's coins bear the earliest representations of the Buddha on a coin (around 120), in Hellenistic style and with the word \\"Boddo\\" in Greek script. Kanishka also had the original Gandhari Prakrit Mahāyāna sūtras translated into Sanskrit, \\"a turning point in the evolution of the Buddhist literary canon\\"Foltz, Religions of the Silk Road, p. 45 The Kanishka casket, dated to the first year of Kanishka's reign in 127, was signed by a Greek artist named Agesilas, who oversaw work at Kanishka's stupas (cetiya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date. ==Philosophical influences== Several Greek philosophers, including Pyrrho, Anaxarchus, and Onesicritus accompanied Alexander in his eastern campaigns. During the 18 months they were in India, they were able to interact with Indian ascetics, generally described as gymnosophists (\\"naked philosophers\\"). ===Pyrrhonism=== Pyrrho returned to Greece and founded Pyrrhonism, the first Western school of skepticism. The Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtius explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.\\"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach Anaxarchus, telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times.\\" (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon) Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist three marks of existence. ===Cynicism=== Another of these philosophers, Onesicritus, a Cynic, is said by Strabo to have learnt in India the following precepts: \\"That nothing that happens to a man is bad or good, opinions being merely dreams. ... That the best philosophy [is] that which liberates the mind from [both] pleasure and grief\\".Strabo, XV.I.65: Cynicism, particularly the Cynic Peregrinus Proteus was further influenced by the tales of the gymnosophists, particularly the examples set by Kalanos, Dandamis, and Zarmanochegas. ===Cyrenaicism=== The Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, from the city of Cyrene where Magas of Cyrene ruled, is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.\\"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed Peisithanatos, \\"The advocate of death\\") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching.\\" ==Artistic influences== Numerous works of Greco-Buddhist art display the intermixing of Greek and Buddhist influences in such creation centers as Gandhara. The subject matter of Gandharan art was definitely Buddhist, while most motifs were of Western Asiatic or Hellenistic origin. ===Anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha=== Mara's assault on the Buddha, 2nd century AD, Amaravathi village, Guntur district, India. Although there is still some debate, the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the Greco-Buddhist interaction. Before this innovation, Buddhist art was \\"aniconic\\": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the Bodhi Tree, Buddha footprints, the Dharmachakra). This reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the Digha Nikaya that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.\\"Due to the statement of the Master in the Dighanikaya disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time\\". Also \\"Hinayanis opposed image worship of the Master due to canonical restrictions\\". R.C. Sharma, in \\"The Art of Mathura, India\\", Tokyo National Museum 2002, p.11 Probably not feeling bound by these restrictions, and because of \\"their cult of form, the Greeks were the first to attempt a sculptural representation of the Buddha\\". In many parts of the Ancient World, the Greeks did develop syncretic divinities, that could become a common religious focus for populations with different traditions: a well-known example is Serapis, introduced by Ptolemy I Soter in Egypt, who combined aspects of Greek and Egyptian Gods. In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek god-king (Apollo, or possibly the deified founder of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Demetrius I of Bactria), with the traditional physical characteristics of the Buddha. Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: himation, the contrapposto stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and ushnisha apparently derived from the style of the Apollo Belvedere (330 BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism. A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the modern site of Hadda, Afghanistan. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the physical characteristics of the Buddha in the Buddhist sutras. The hair with curls turning to the right is first described in the Pāli canon; we find the same description in the Dāsāṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā. Greek artists were most probably the authors of these early representations of the Buddha, in particular the standing statues, which display \\"a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work. This is Classical or Hellenistic Greek, not archaizing Greek transmitted by Persia or Bactria, nor distinctively Roman.\\"Boardman p. 126 The Greek stylistic influence on the representation of the Buddha, through its idealistic realism, also permitted a very accessible, understandable and attractive visualization of the ultimate state of enlightenment described by Buddhism, allowing it to reach a wider audience: During the following centuries, this anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha defined the canon of Buddhist art, but progressively evolved to incorporate more Indian and Asian elements. ===Hellenized Buddhist pantheon=== A Buddhist coin of Kanishka I, with legend ΒΟΔΔΟ \\"Boddo\\" (=the Buddha) in Greek script on the reverse. Several other Buddhist deities may have been influenced by Greek gods. For example, Heracles with a lion-skin, the protector deity of Demetrius I of Bactria, \\"served as an artistic model for Vajrapani, a protector of the Buddha\\".See Images of the Herakles-influenced Vajrapani: In Japan, this expression further translated into the wrath-filled and muscular Niō guardian gods of the Buddha, standing today at the entrance of many Buddhist temples. According to Katsumi Tanabe, professor at Chūō University, Japan, besides Vajrapani, Greek influence also appears in several other gods of the Mahayana pantheon such as the Japanese Fūjin, inspired from the Greek divinity Boreas through the Greco-Buddhist Wardo, or the mother deity Hariti inspired by Tyche. In addition, forms such as garland-bearing cherubs, vine scrolls, and such semihuman creatures as the centaur and triton, are part of the repertory of Hellenistic art introduced by Greco-Roman artists in the service of the Kushan court. ==ExchangesGandharan proselytism in the East=== Central Asian monk teaching East-Asian monk. A fresco from the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves, dated to the 9th or 10th century (Kara-Khoja Kingdom). Greek monks played a direct role in the upper hierarchy of Buddhism, and in its early dissemination. During the rule (165–135 BC) of the Greco-Bactrian King Menander I (Pali: \\"Milinda\\"), Mahadharmaraksita (literally translated as 'Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma') was \\"a Greek (Pali: Yona, lit. Ionian) Buddhist head monk,\\" according to the Mahavamsa (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \\"the Greek city of Alasandra\\" (Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150 km north of today's Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura. Dharmaraksita (Sanskrit), or Dhammarakkhita (Pali) (translation: Protected by the Dharma), was one of the missionaries sent by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to proselytize the Buddhist faith. He is described as being a Greek (Pali: \\"Yona\\", lit. \\"Ionian\\") in the Mahavamsa, and his activities are indicative of the strength of the Hellenistic Greek involvement during the formative centuries of Buddhism. Indeed, Menander I was famously converted to Buddhism by Nagasena, who was a student of the Greek Buddhist monk Dharmaraksita. Menander is said to have reached enlightenment as an arhat under Nagasena's guidance and is recorded as a great patron of Buddhism. The dialogue of the Greek King Menander I (Pali \\"Milinda\\") with the monk Nagasena comprises the Pali Buddhist work known as the Milinda Panha. Buddhist monks from the region of Gandhara in Afghanistan, where Greco-Buddhism was most influential, later played a key role in the development and the transmission of Buddhist ideas in the direction of northern Asia. Greco-Buddhist Kushan monks such as Lokaksema () travelled to the Chinese capital of Loyang, where they became the first translators of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as indicated by the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves frescos from the Tarim Basin. In legend too Bodhidharma, the founder of Chán-Buddhism, which later became Zen, and the legendary originator of the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolin Kung Fu, is described as a Buddhist monk from Central Asia in the first Chinese references to him (Yan Xuan-Zhi in 547). Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian, and he is referred as \\"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\\" () in Chinese Chan texts. In 485, according to the 7th century Chinese historical treatise Liang Shu, five monks from Gandhara travelled to the country of Fusang (\\"The country of the extreme East\\" beyond the sea, probably eastern Japan), where they introduced Buddhism: Two half-brothers from Gandhara, Asanga and Vasubandhu (4th century), created the Yogacara or \\"Mind-only\\" school of Mahayana Buddhism, which through one of its major texts, the Lankavatara Sutra, became a founding block of Mahayana, and particularly Zen, philosophy. ===Greco-Buddhism in the West=== Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription (Greek and Aramaic) 3rd century BC by Indian Buddhist King Ashoka. This edict advocates the adoption of \\"godliness\\" using the Greek term Eusebeia for Dharma. Kabul Museum. Intense westward physical exchange at that time along the Silk Road is confirmed by the Roman craze for silk from the 1st century BC to the point that the Senate issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds. This is attested by at least three authors: Strabo (64/63 BC – ), Seneca the Younger ( – AD 65), and Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79). The aforementioned Strabo and Plutarch (–125) also wrote about Indo-Greek Buddhist king Menander, confirming that information about the Indo-Greek Buddhists was circulating throughout the Hellenistic world. Zarmanochegas (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) who, according to ancient historians such as Strabo and Dio Cassius, met Nicholas of Damascus in Antioch while Augustus (died AD 14) was ruling the Roman Empire, and shortly thereafter proceeded to Athens where he burnt himself to death. His story and tomb in Athens were well-known over a century later. Plutarch (died AD 120) in his Life of Alexander, after discussing the self-immolation of Calanus of India (Kalanos) witnessed by Alexander writes: \\"The same thing was done long after by another Indian who came with Caesar to Athens, where they still show you 'the Indian's Monument,'\\" referring to Zarmanochegas' tomb in Roman Athens. Another century later the Christian church father Clement of Alexandria (died 215) mentioned Buddha by name in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV): \\"The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called Sarmanæ and others Brahmins. And those of the Sarmanæ who are called \\"Hylobii\\" neither inhabit cities, nor have roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts, and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children. Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of Buddha (Βούττα) whom, on account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine honours.\\" Indian gravestones from the Ptolemaic period have been found in Alexandria in Egypt. The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria at this time is important, since \\"It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established\\". The pre-Christian monastic order of the Therapeutae is possibly a deformation of the Pāli word \\"Theravāda\\",According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy a form of Buddhism, and the movement may have \\"almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism\\". They may even have been descendants of Asoka's emissaries to the West. While Philo of Alexandria's description of the doctrines and practices of the Therapeutae leaves great ambiguity about what religion they are associated with, analysis by religious scholar Ullrich R. Kleinhempel indicates that the most likely religion the Therapeutae practiced was Buddhism.Ullrich R . Kleinhempel, \\"Traces of Buddhist Presence in Alexandria: Philo and the \\"Therapeutae\\"\\", Научно- теоретический журнал 2019 https://www.academia.edu/39841429/Traces_of_Buddhist_Presence_in_Alexandria_Philo_and_the_Therapeutae_ ===Buddhism and Christianity=== Queen Māyā's white elephant dream, and the conception of the Buddha. Gandhara, 2nd–3rd century AD. Although the philosophical systems of Buddhism and Christianity have evolved in rather different ways, the moral precepts advocated by Buddhism from the time of Ashoka through his edicts do have some similarities with the Christian moral precepts developed more than two centuries later: respect for life, respect for the weak, rejection of violence, pardon to sinners, tolerance. One theory is that these similarities may indicate the propagation of Buddhist ideals into the Western World, with the Greeks acting as intermediaries and religious syncretists. The story of the birth of the Buddha was well known in the West, and possibly influenced the story of the birth of Jesus: Saint Jerome (4th century) mentions the birth of the Buddha, who he says \\"was born from the side of a virgin,\\"McEvilley, p391 and the influential early Christian church father Clement of Alexandria (died 215) mentioned Buddha (Βούττα) in his Stromata (Bk I, Ch XV). The legend of Christian saints Barlaam and Josaphat draws on the life of the Buddha. On the Christian versions see A. S.

It was best known for its innovative waste collection vehicles that were the preferred choice of municipal authorities in the UK together with their gully emptiers, cesspool cleaning vehicles and street watering and washing vehicles.Shelvoke And Drewry Limited. The Times, Monday, 26 April 1937; pg. 23; Issue 47668 Cable drum carriers were supplied to the General Post Office and vehicles and ground equipment built for the Royal Air Force. Shelvoke and Drewry also manufactured fire engines, buses and fork-lift trucks. ==The Shelvoke and Drewry Freighter== The business began in 1921 as a partnership of Harry Shelvoke and James Drewry both of whom had successful careers in commercial vehicle design and manufacture. At that time municipal refuse vehicles were almost all horse- drawn, uneconomical and inconvenient and required the use of ladders. In their \\"S D Freighter\\" Shelvoke and Drewry offered a motorised, low-loading alternative which became almost universal. A selection of vehicles (From L-R: Freighter (x2), W-Type, T-Type, P-Type 1959 W-Type fore and aft tipper Ownership was soon transferred from their partnership to Shelvoke and Drewry Limited incorporated 10 October 1922. A stock market listing was achieved in 1937. The \\"Freighter\\", originally a multi-purpose flatbed truck notable for its tiny wheels and tiller-type steering, was adapted for refuse collection. Several vehicles were also converted into single-decker buses and used in Worthing, West Sussex, where there were known as the Worthing Tramocars. Shelvoke and Drewry rapidly became an established innovator in the field of refuse collection vehicle design, producing vehicles such as the Fore and Aft Tipper, which used a pivoting body to redistribute the load, and the Revopak of the 1970s which used a huge revolving fork to mutilate and compact refuse. ===War production=== During the Second World War, like most British manufacturers, Shelvoke and Drewry's entire output was devoted to the war effort, producing aircraft parts, equipment for landing craft and tanks, and even a miniature submarine (the Welfreighter) at their Letchworth plant. ===1960s=== Profits were falling by 1964. In that year the reasons given by the chairman were the introduction of their new Defiant forklift trucks, the transfer of production to a new factory building and a scarcity of labour and materials in the face of intense competition from the big motor manufacturers.Lower Profits for Shelvoke and Drewry.

London's Burning. 1982 P-Series Revopak dustcart In the late 1970s, Shelvoke and Drewry went head-to-head with its arch-rival Dennis, and once-again began to manufacture fire engines through its newly established Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) division. S&D; had also collaborated with Dennis along with Ogle Design to develop a new common cab for both companies' product lines - this emerged as the P-Series in 1978. By the end of 1979 the chairman reported that Shelvoke and Drewry turned out about 1,000 vehicles each year. Dustcarts left the factory as finished products but fire and air crash tenders were fitted out, completed, by outside contractors. A quarter of municipal vehicles were exported and 85 per cent of the special purpose chassis were sent overseas.Competitors clean up in British dustcarts. The Times, Saturday, 22 December 1979; pg. 17; Issue 60507 Early in 1981 Shelvoke and Drewry were obliged to report they had made another 150 redundant having previously cut the jobs of over 300 employees. Remaining workers were on a three-day week and apprentices on a two day week.1,000 more made redundant. The Times, Saturday, 7 February 1981; pg. 19; Issue 60846 The following year another 100 jobs were cut and factories were closed.Butterfield halves losses. The Times, Wednesday, 8 December 1982; pg. 14; Issue 61409 ===Shelvoke Dempster 1984 to 1990=== At the end of 1983 Butterfield was rescued by a short-term loan from an American investment company, Technology Incorporated. Butterfield was unable to raise alternative funds to make repayment and under the terms of the loan Technology Incorporated assumed control of Butterfield. Ownership was transferred to Shelvoke Dempster on 1 January 1984. Dempster Systems was an American subsidiary of Technology Incorporated.Butterfield-Harvey. The Times, Saturday, 7 July 1984; pg. 24; Issue 61877 Otherwise Shelvoke's circumstances did not change. Demand for dustcarts had not picked up again, Shelvoke was described as Butterfield's \\"running sore\\". One of the two Shelvoke factories was forced to close (160 jobs) and in-house component manufacture was contracted out. The first new Shelvoke Dempster product, Dempster's Routechief intermittent rear loader, went into production at Letchworth. Shelvoke Dempster also distributed these American-made products: Routeking II rear loader, Dumpster front loader, Dinosaur and Dragon III roll-on and roll-off systems and Dempster Dumpster products. Established Shelvoke products like Revopak and the special-purpose vehicles remained in production at Letchworth. The Letchworth workforce was now 350 people.Drewry Out Dempster In.

Commercial Motor, 21 June 1990, Page 18 ===Shutdown=== However the new venture went into receivership in July 1991. The receivers sold the saleable activities and the remaining assets and design rights were bought by Dennis Eagle. About 70 Shelvoke staff were made redundant. Dennis Eagle expected the extra business would add about £2.5 million to turnover but no new Shelvoke designs would be made once current orders were filled. Parts and maintenance would be supplied for the remaining (2,000?) Shelvoke vehicles still operating. The Letchworth factory closed.Trinity buys rival's assets. Commercial Motor, 5 September 1991, Page 15 ==Post mortem== Shelvoke's demise was attributed to a number of factors - for instance the deregulation of waste collection in the 1980s meant that many municipal authorities subcontracted this activity out to private companies. Their vehicles had traditionally been considerably more expensive than those of their competitors (largely due to their hand-built aluminium bodywork) and cost-conscious councils soon started investing in cheaper foreign vehicles. Shelvoke had also spent huge amounts trying to make money on the special purpose vehicles venture, and fought an increasingly futile battle with Dennis. They tenaciously stuck with their Revopak continuous loading system for waste collection vehicles, which, although effective, was more expensive to operate due to higher fuel consumption, and authorities looked for cost- saving intermittent-loading dustcarts instead. Dennis launched their Phoenix range of sweep/slide style refuse compactor dustcarts in 1979, which, with their lower operating costs, quickly eroded Shelvoke's market share. Many hundreds of Shelvoke and Drewry vehicles are still in service. For example, many fire engines are kept at small provincial airports, and many developing countries use ex-British second-hand refuse collection vehicles, most notably on the island of Malta. ==See also== *Waste collection vehicle *Preserved Shelvoke and Drewry Vehicles ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Kaleidoscope of Shelvoke and Drewry, Nick Baldwin & William Negus (1980) * Municipal Refuse Collection Vehicles, Barrie C.

The PMOM's pictorial includes nude photographs and a centerfold poster, along with a pictorial biography and the \\"Playmate Data Sheet\\", which lists her birthdate, measurements, turn-ons, and turn-offs. At the end of the year, one of the 12 Playmates of the Month is named Playmate of the Year (PMOY). Every Playmate of the Month is awarded a prize of US$25,000 and each Playmate of the Year receives an additional prize of US$100,000 plus a car (specifically, a short-term lease of a car) and other discretionary gifts. In addition, Anniversary Playmates are usually chosen to celebrate a milestone year of the magazine. Playboy encourages potential Playmates to send photos with \\"girl next door\\" appeal for consideration; others may submit photos of Playmate candidates, and may be eligible for a finder's fee if their model is selected. In addition, \\"casting calls\\" are held regularly in major US cities to offer opportunities for women to test for Playboy. Until just prior to the death of Hugh Hefner, he personally selected each Playmate of the Month and every Playmate of the Year, taking into account an annual readers' poll. According to Playboy, there is no such thing as a former Playmate because \\"Once a Playmate, always a Playmate\\". ==History== Marilyn Monroe, who was featured in the first issue, was the only one to appear as \\"Sweetheart of the Month\\". The first model called a Playmate of the Month was Margie Harrison, Miss January 1954, in the second issue of Playboy. Generally a woman may appear only once as a Playmate, but in the early years of the magazine, some models were featured multiple times. Marilyn Waltz (February 1954, April 1954, April 1955 her first appearance was as Margaret Scott) and Janet Pilgrim (July 1955, December 1955, and October 1956) are tied for the most appearances. Margie Harrison (January 1954, June 1954) and Marguerite Empey (May 1955, February 1956) are the only other women to appear more than once as Playmates. Under current law in most US jurisdictions, publishing nude pictures of a model younger than 18 would be a felony. However, in the early years of the magazine, laws regarding corruption of a minor were less well established. Several playmates including Nancy Crawford (April 1959), Donna Michelle (December 1963), Linda Moon (October 1966), Patti Reynolds (September 1965) and Teddi Smith (July 1960) posed when they were 17. Elizabeth Ann Roberts (January 1958) whose pictorial was called \\"Schoolmate Playmate\\" posed when she was 16. Hugh Hefner and Roberts' mother were arrested as a result, but the case was subsequently dismissed because Roberts' mother had signed a statement that her daughter was 18 before the photo shoot. In 1979 Ursula Buchfellner posed for the German edition of Playboy when she was 16 and subsequently posed for the American edition (October 1979) when she was 18. Dutch Playmate twins Karin and Mirjam van Breeschooten appeared at age 17 in their country's edition of Playboy in June 1988, at 18, they were Misses September 1989 in the US version. Some women have become Playmates in their 30s. Dolores Donlon (August 1957) is the oldest Playmate to date, appearing in her shoot at the age of 36. ===Playmate firsts=== * First Playmate: Margie Harrison (Miss January 1954) in the second issue of Playboy.

Although February 1954 Playmate Marilyn Waltz gained much popularity, receiving more fan mail than any other Playmate that year, she was not crowned PMOY. Neither was December 1956 Playmate Lisa Winters who was named Playmate of the Year, and although Joyce Nizzari, Miss December 1958, was named the \\"most popular\\" Playmate of 1958, the PMOY competition was first officially won in 1960 by Miss December 1959, Ellen Stratton. The 2009 PMOY, Ida Ljungqvist, was the 50th PMOY and the second model of African descent to win the title, the first being Renee Tenison. A PMOY makes her appearance the year following her first appearance as PMOM. This feature is usually published in the June issue, although sometimes it has been published in the May or July issue. Until 2003, each year's Playmate of the Year would routinely appear on the cover of her PMOY issue, in which her PMOY pictorial is featured. However, from 2003 to 2005, PMOYs did not appear on the covers of their PMOY issues, and 2007 PMOY Sara Jean Underwood did not either. Instead, celebrities appearing in celebrity pictorials in the PMOY issues appeared on the covers. The 2010 PMOY, Hope Dworaczyk, did appear on the cover, and was the first model to be the subject of a three-dimensional Playboy centerfold photograph. The average age of a Playmate of the Year, 23.5 years, is slightly higher than that of a Playmate of the Month, 22.4 years. In 1964, at the age of 18, Donna Michelle became the youngest PMOY ever. Jo Collins (1965) and Christa Speck (1962) both were 19. Sharon Clark (1971), Karen McDougal (1998) and Ida Ljungqvist (2009) became PMOY at the age of 27. Only three women became PMOY in their 30s: Tiffany Fallon (2005) at 31, Kathy Shower (1986) at 33, and Eugena Washington (2016) at 31. ==Notable Playmates== Playmates who attained fame for reasons in addition to their Playboy appearance(s) include (with the date of their appearance): * Pamela Anderson (February 1990), actress * Marina Baker (March 1987), journalist, children's book author, mayor of Telscombe, East Sussex, England * Bebe Buell (November 1974), author and mother of Liv Tyler * Lisa Dergan (July 1998), spokesmodel for St. Pauli Girl and Guess?

Also known as \\"E\\", he is known for writing songs tackling subjects such as death, loneliness, divorce, childhood innocence, depression, and unrequited love. ==Biography== Mark Oliver Everett is the son of physicist Hugh Everett III, originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. Everett's maternal grandfather was Harold \\"Kid\\" Gore, a legendary men's basketball, football and baseball coach at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. When Everett was in his early teens, there was an incident that occurred while he was attending a concert by English rock band The Who, where a laser directly hit Everett's eye. As a result of this incident, he has needed to wear glasses ever since. In 1987, Everett moved from his family home in Virginia and resettled in California. There, Everett began his professional musical career with two major-label albums: A Man Called E and Broken Toy Shop. The pseudonym \\"E\\" was used for both of these early recordings. He became known as \\"E\\" because there were several people in his life at the time who had the same first name. While it may have caused some confusion in record stores and radio stations, the single-letter name gave the press a playful handle. This playfulness was evident in a review by the eminent writer Daniel Levitin which began: \\"Excellent eponymous effort, energizingly eclectic. Early enthusiasm effectively ensures E's eminence.\\" A Billboard magazine review of his second album was similarly positive. In July 2014 Everett was given the Freedom of the City of London, at a ceremony held prior to his concert at the Barbican Centre. Everett has described himself as an agnostic and also explicitly used language about thanking God. ===Everett's family=== Everett's family has been an inspiration to him, e.g. the song \\"Things the Grandchildren Should Know\\" (he would later publish an autobiography of the same name) and the song \\"3 Speed\\", referencing the writings of his sister Liz. Everett made a documentary about both his father's theory and his own relationship with his father entitled Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives for the BBC that was aired on the PBS series NOVA in 2008. Everett's father, Hugh, died of heart failure when Everett was 19. Mark was the one to find him. His sister, Elizabeth, died by suicide in 1996, and in 1998 his mother, Nancy Everett née Gore, died of lung cancer. Following these tragedies, Everett and the Eels released Electro-Shock Blues in 1998. His cousin, Jennifer Lewis née Gore, was a flight attendant on the plane that struck The Pentagon during the September 11, 2001 attacks. The plane struck the side of the Pentagon where his father had worked, and Everett remarks in his autobiography that he wonders whether the plane hit his father's old office. In 2000 he married Natalia Kovaleva, a Russian dentist he met near Hamburg, Germany. The marriage ended after five years. Following the EELS' tour accompanying their eleventh studio album, The Cautionary Tales of Mark Oliver Everett, Everett took a break from music. During this period, he met a Scottish woman employed in the film industry, whom he ended up marrying. At the age of 54, Everett became a father for the first time, his then-wife having given birth to their son, Archie McGregor Everett. The couple, however, divorced some time later. ==Career== Everett has used everything from a toy piano in his early \\"Symphony for a Toy Piano in G Minor\\" to hammers on a radiator as percussion in 1998's \\"Cancer for the Cure\\". Despite his constant denials, he is suspected of being the man behind MC Honky, who released the album I Am the Messiah in 2003. Everett's music has also been featured on a number of films, including American Beauty (\\"Cancer for the Cure\\"), Road Trip (\\"Mr. E's Beautiful Blues\\"), Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (\\"Christmas is Going to the Dogs\\"), Holes (\\"Eyes Down,\\" \\"Mighty Fine Blues\\"), Shrek (\\"My Beloved Monster\\"), Shrek 2 (\\"I Need Some Sleep\\"), Shrek The Third (\\"Royal Pain\\" and \\"Losing Streak\\"), Shrek the Halls (\\"The Stars Shine in the Sky Tonight\\"), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (\\"Beautiful Freak\\"), Henry Poole is Here (Love of the Loveless), The Big White (Last Stop;This Town) Hot Fuzz (\\"Souljacker, pt.1\\"), The Big Year (\\"I Like Birds\\"), as well as most of the music in Yes Man. Additionally, his song Fresh Blood (off Hombre Lobo) forms the music played over the credits of HBO's The Jinx. During 2005, Everett and his ad hoc Eels went on tour promoting his album, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. It was during this recording that he worked with long-time hero and influence Tom Waits. In November 2007, Everett published his autobiography, entitled Things the Grandchildren Should Know. The 2007 BBC Scotland / BBC Four television documentary \\"Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives\\", followed Everett as he talked to physicists and his father's former colleagues about his father's theory. The documentary won a Royal Television Society award on March 19, 2008. The documentary was shown in lieu of a support act during their UK, US, Irish and Australian tours in the spring of 2008. In the U.S., the PBS program Nova broadcast the documentary in October 2008. The seventh Eels studio album—Hombre Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire—was released on June 2, 2009. On January 19, 2010, Everett released his eighth Eels album, entitled End Times, which deals with themes of aging and divorce. On August 23, 2010, Eels released a 9th album, 'Tomorrow Morning', which represents the final part of the trilogy begun by 'Hombre Lobo.' Everett plays an acoustic version of the Eels tune ‘What I Have to Offer’ in a deleted scene from This Is 40,Included in the bonus features on the dvd/Blu-ray release of This Is 40 and follows his performance by telling Rudd's record-executive character that the band has decided to sign a contract with a competing label. On February 4, 2013, the tenth album of Eels, Wonderful, Glorious, was released, followed by The Cautionary Tales Of Mark Oliver Everett, released only a year later on April 21, 2014. On February 19, 2016, Everett appeared as Brian in Series 1 Episode 4 (A Party in the Hills) of Judd Apatow's Love, playing a cover of Paul McCartney's song 'Jet.' He also briefly appeared in Series 1 Episode 9, Series 2 Episode 2 and Series 3 Episode 6. He had a small cameo in Bill & Ted Face the Music. The twelfth Eels album, The Deconstruction, was released on April 6, 2018.

Introduced in 1971, the Revopak was a British-built clone of the French Bennes-Ray \\"Superpac\\". It was one of the first vehicles to address the problem of compacting and destroying the high content of packaging materials now found in domestic refuse. By using a huge, hydraulic-powered rotating rake with large steel tines, refuse was scooped up from the loading hopper and forced through a set of stationary tines. The continuous rotation of the rake progressively mangled, mutilated and compacted the refuse so as to reduce the space required to dump it at the landfill site. Two generations of the Revopak were produced - the early 1971-1973 models used hydraulic motors which drove the compaction rake by means of chains, while the later models used a simpler and more robust drive system which consisted of twin synchronised hydraulic rams to operate the compaction system. Many variations were made of the basic design, including a multitude of different body lengths and payloads, plus SD developed bin lifters as an optional extra - a precursor to the modern wheeled bin collection systems of today. One disadvantage of the system was heavier fuel consumption, since the compaction system has to run continuously in order to be effective. The Revopak was in continuous production until 1990, when SD went out of business, although the French built unit is still manufactured by SEMAT.

Joe narrowly defeated Colin, but both became regulars in the comic, as Joe's victory was by just 1%.

He was born in Blåkrog in the Duchy of Schleswig (now in Aabenraa Municipality, in the southern part of Jutland in Denmark), to Henrik Vilhelm Eckersberg, painter and carpenter, and Ingeborg Nielsdatter. He went on to lay the foundation for the period of art known as the Golden Age of Danish Painting, and is referred to as the Father of Danish painting. ==LifeGrowing up and early training=== Self portrait at the age of twenty-eight (1811) In 1786 Eckersberg's family moved to Blans, a village near the picturesque Alssund, where he enjoyed drawing pictures of the surrounding countryside, and taking sailing tours in his father's boat. After confirmation he began his training as a painter under church and portrait painter Jes Jessen of Aabenraa (1797–1800). He continued his training at age 17 under Josiah Jacob Jessen in Flensborg, where he became an apprentice in May 1800. He, however, had his sights set on being accepted at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) in Copenhagen. ===Training at the Academy=== View north of Kronborg Castle Still under apprenticeship he produced proficient drawings and paintings. Having amassed some money, including financial support from local well-wishers, he arrived at Copenhagen's Tollbooth on 23 May 1803. He was accepted into the Academy without payment in 1803 where he studied with Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, among others. He made good progress, painting historical paintings, portraits and landscapes. However, friction between him and Abildgaard impeded his advancement, and he did not win the Academy's big gold medal until 1809, after Abildgaard's death. He also worked to earn living money as a hand laborer, and he made drawings for copperplate etchings. Although he received promise of a travel stipend in conjunction with the gold medal, the actual funds would not be made available until 1812. On 1 July 1810, he married E. Christine Rebecca Hyssing against his wishes, in order to 'legitimize' a son, Erling Carl Vilhelm Eckersberg, that was born to her. His son, Erling, eventually followed in his father's footsteps with an academy education, and a career as a copperplate engraver. ===Student travels=== Ulysses Fleeing the Cave of Polyphemus, 1812, Princeton University Art Museum, painted while under the tutelage of Jacques-Louis David Eager to travel, not only on account of his desire to stretch his artistic skills and knowledge, but also in order to escape the reality of this marriage, he made other arrangements for the financial support needed that would allow him to travel. On 3 July, a few days after the wedding, he began his travels out of the country. Along with Tønnes Christian Bruun de Neergaard, writer, enthusiastic art lover and financial supporter, he made his way over Germany to Paris. Here he studied under neoclassicist Jacques-Louis David from 1811 to 1812. He improved his skills in painting the human form, and followed his teacher's admonition to paint after Nature and the Antique in order to find Truth. It was here that he developed a lifelong friendship with Paris roommate, fellow artist Jens Peter Møller, and with engraver Johan Frederik Clemens, Jens Juel's collaborator. View of the interior of the Colosseum After two years he traveled further via Florence to Rome where he continued his studies between 1813 and 1816. He worked on improving his skills as a history painter, and enjoyed painting smaller studies of the local life and area. He lived there three years among a store group of artists, with Bertel Thorvaldsen as the cultural head. Eckersberg and Thorvaldsen developed a close lasting relationship, and the master served the younger Eckersberg as both loyal friend and advisor. Eckersberg painted one of his best portraits, a portrait of Thorvaldsen, in Rome 1814, which was donated to the Academy of Art. Life in Rome agreed with him, and he was greatly affected by the bright southern light he experienced there. He produced a large body of work during those years, including a number of exceptional landscape studies. His divorce from Hyssing was finalized during his stay out of the country, and on 2 August 1816 he had returned to Denmark. ===An academic career=== Shortly after his return to Denmark he arranged for his admission into the Academy, and received as the subject of his admissions painting the Norse legend, the Death of Baldur. On 8 February 1817 he wed Elisabeth Cathrine Julie Juel, daughter of Jens Juel, portrait painter and professor at the Academy. They had two sons and four daughters before her death in 1827. He was admitted as member of the Academy in October 1817, and was named professor at the Academy in 1818 having acceded to the vacant professorship caused by the death of Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard in 1809. The Academy had waited to fill the position until Eckersberg had returned to Denmark from his student travels, while delaying the attempts by Abildgaard's disciple, Christian Fædder Høyer, from Christian Gotlieb Kratzenstein-Stub, and from J. L. Lund to seek the same position. Finally the Academy awarded the position not only to Eckersberg, but also to Lund. A year after the death of his wife Elisabeth in 1827, he married her sister Susanne Henriette Emilie Juel, with whom he also had several children. He was director of the Academy from 1827 to 1829. His eyesight failed him in later life and he had to give up painting. He died in Copenhagen of cholera on 22 July 1853 during the great epidemic. He is buried in Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery. == Works == Thorvaldsen's Italian mistress, Anna Maria Magnani He was commissioned to do a number of historical paintings for Christiansborg Palace, as well as altarpieces. His best known works are portraits of the Copenhagen middle class, such as the \\"Nathanson family picture\\" (Det Nathansonske Familiebillede), 1818, and the official portrait of Frederick VI (Frederik VI). In spite of his abilities in this genre, his career in portraiture was short-lived, due to the competition he received from then popular Christian Albrecht Jensen. Marine paintings were another genre he developed with great interest. He had a passion for ships, and sailed around the Skagerrak, the Kattegat, the North Sea, and as far as the English Channel at the age of 56. The experience of sailing out on the open seas gave new dimension to his marine paintings, which until that point tended to be calm depictions. Now there was more attention given to movement and to waves. Woman Standing in Front of a Mirror) 1841 The Admiralty in 1819 had granted him free access to the Copenhagen Naval Station (Holmen), thus giving him occasion to view the many ships – a favorite motive in his paintings. During summer, the sailors would practice swimming here – of course all naked. This gave Eckersberg a unique opportunity to watch men in a state of complete undress and to make an artistic evaluation of their physical build. He could thus here select the models whom he needed for his paintings with motives from Greek or Roman antiquity. His biggest contribution to painting was through his professorship at the Academy. He revitalized teaching by taking students out into the field, where they were challenged to do studies from nature. In this way it was he who introduced direct study from nature into Danish art. He also encouraged his students to develop their individual strengths, thus creating unique styles. He developed an increasing interest in perspective on account of his marine paintings. He wrote a dissertation on the subject called \\"Linear perspective used in the art of painting\\" (Linearperspektiven, anvendt paa Malerkunsten), 1841, and taught classes on the subject at the Academy. He made a small number of etchings that combine daily life observations with classical, harmonious principles of composition. This led the way to the characteristic manner in which Golden Age painters portrayed common, everyday life. There is a self-portrait from 1803, a bust of him by Thorvaldsen from 1816 and a portrait by Marstrand from 1836. ==Pupils== Bella and Hanna. The Eldest Daughters of M. L.

Each year the houses compete for points in order to win the Allen Grant Trophy. The school motto is Dieu et mon droit (French for God and my right, referring to the monarch's divine right to govern) and is generally used as the motto of the British monarch. Originally it was spelled Dieut et mon droict, the Early Modern French spelling, but later the 't' in \\"Dieut\\" was dropped in accordance with present French orthography. The 'c' in droict was also dropped. In the 1970s the motto was 'Pax Huic Domui', 'Peace to this House' (traditionally the words a priest says when visiting a sick person). The school hymn is Our God, Our Help in Ages Past, written by a famous former pupil, Isaac Watts. The clock tower at the Civic Centre, Southampton plays the same tune at 4, 8, and 12 o'clock, after it has chimed the hour. In 2011, 100% of pupils achieved 5+ A*-C GCSEs (or equivalent) including English and maths, with 85% achieving all English Baccalaureate subjects.

In 1979 they created the Fairlight CMI, one of the earliest digital audio workstation (DAW) with digital audio sampler, quickly used by artists such as Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, and Jean Michel Jarre. They are now a manufacturer of media tools such as digital audio recording and mixing consoles. Fairlight became such a prominent part of 1980s pop music that Phil Collins included the text \\"there is no Fairlight on this record\\" in the liner notes of No Jacket Required. ==History== In 1975, Fairlight Instruments Pty Ltd was established by Peter Vogel and Kim Ryrie. They produced microprocessor-based music workstations with samplers, which were revolutionary for their time. New sounds could be created by drawing a 'sound wave' on the screen, which the computer would produce as sound. Theoretically, any sound was possible. Apart from opening up a world of new sounds, the Fairlight gave composers and performers instant playback. By changing the wave patterns presented on a screen they could tweak a sound into shape without singing or performing it all over again. The versatility of the early Fairlight was not lost on recording artists. The first record made entirely on a computer in the United States was done by EBN- OZN (Ned Liben, who represented Fairlight in New York, and Robert Ozn) – \\"AEIOU Sometimes Y\\" made in 1981, released in 1983. Their hybrid analogue/digital Computer Video Instrument, invented by Kia Silverbrook, debuted in 1984.1984 Billboard magazine article on Fairlight CVI The fact that the CVI was also a \\"computer\\" was transparent to its use: it did not use a conventional ASCII keyboard (though in later models one could be attached), but rather a set of sliders and a small graphics pad about the size of the palm of a hand. Menu selections were made with a stylus rather than a mouse. The CVI allowed you to paint directly over the top of video footage as well as \\"with\\" video footage via an extensive series of effects. In April 1989, Fairlight ESP (Electric Sound and Picture) was established by Kim Ryrie, with the financial backing of Australian distributor Amber. In September 2016 Fairlight was acquired by Blackmagic Design. ==Products== * CMI Music sampler (mid 1970s) * MXF Digital Audio Workstation with dedicated Audio control surface (at least 3 versions) (MXF3 released 1997) * Dream Constellation Digital Audio Workstation with integrated Audio control surface and Mixing console (2004) * Crystal Core processing engine – a sound processing device capable of sampling frequencies up to 384 kHz.

In July 2012, the company Fairlight Instruments changed its name to Peter Vogel Instruments. Peter Vogel announced the company was developing a completely new keyboard synthesizer which would be launched at Winter NAMM 2013. The name change was the result of a disagreement between the owners of the Fairlight Instruments trademark and himself that resulted in Fairlight revoking his license to use the name. According to them, the use of the Fairlight name only extended to the new version of the CMI, now called the CMI-30A in reference to the instrument's 30th anniversary. Additionally, it extended to several other CMI hardware products planned, including a PC-based \\"Series IV.\\" They claimed that because Vogel had also used the Fairlight name for the iOS CMI app as well, he had violated the terms of the agreement, and they were within their rights to terminate the agreement. Vogel said that he believed that the licensing agreement also extended to the app as well, but the Federal Court held the agreement had been validly terminated.. Vogel appealed to a full court of the Federal Court however the appeal was only partially successful,. and Fairlight was required to pay 50% of Vogel's costs for the appeal.. The iOS app was temporarily withdrawn from the App Store, but subsequently returned. The CMI-30A, however, has remained out of production, and visitors to the Vogel Instruments website are greeted with a notification that sales of the CMI-30A have been suspended pending the resolution of litigation with Fairlight. ==ReferencesCompany making the Fairlight CMI 30th Anniversary edition * FairlightUS North America * Fairlight Europe * Candor Chasma – The main French resource about the Fairlight CMI (English version available) * Image of Xynergi based studio * Some of Peter Vogel's historical Fairlight images and music collection. * http://www.fairlightau.com/Archive_Site/2006au2.html * http://www.vintagesynth.com/ * Technical and historical infos: CMI hardware + software (site by K.M.I.)

The team filled the void left by the Wausau Timbers of the Class A Midwest League, who relocated after the 1990 season to Geneva, Illinois, to become the Kane County Cougars. In 1998 Clark Eckhoff purchased The Wisconsin Woodchucks, and Eckhoff truly made an impact on the team as well as the community as a whole. Not only did attendance dramatically increase with Eckhoff as owner, but the Woodchucks would go on to win two league championships in 2001 and 2003.

They consist of all synapsids excluding the therapsids and their descendants. Because more advanced synapsid group therapsida evolved directly from the pelycosaurs, the pelycosaurs are paraphyletic. Thus the name \\"pelycosaurs,\\" similar to the term \\"mammal-like reptiles,\\" had fallen out of favor among scientists by the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature. ==Etymology== The term pelycosaur has been fairly well abandoned by paleontologists because it no longer matches the features that distinguish a clade. The modern word was created from Greek πέλυξ pelyx 'wooden bowl' or 'axe' and σαῦρος sauros 'lizard'. The intended etymology presents a problem, since pelycosaur as created basically means 'basin lizard', but there is a ambiguity between several original Greek words in that pélix is 'wooden bowl' and pelíkē 'basin', whereas pélyx is 'ax' like pélekys 'double-edged ax'. Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic taxon because it excludes the therapsids. For that reason, the term is sometimes avoided by proponents of a strict cladistic approach. Eupelycosauria is used to designate the clade that includes most Pelycosaurs, along with the Therapsida and the Mammals. In contrast to \\"Pelycosaurs\\", this is a monophyletic group. Caseasauria refers to a pelycosaur side-branch, or clade, that did not leave any descendants. ==Evolutionary history== Comparison of \\"pelycosaurian\\" skulls: 1 sphenacodont, 2 ophiacodont, 3 caseid. The quadratojugale is green, squamosale is red, jugale is blue. The pelycosaurs appear to have been a group of synapsids that have direct ancestral links with the mammals, having differentiated teeth and a developing hard palate. The pelycosaurs appeared during the Late Carboniferous and reached their apex in the early part of the Permian, remaining the dominant land animals for some 40 million years. A few continued into the Capitanian. They were succeeded by the therapsids. ==Description== Cotylorhynchus (background), Ophiacodon and Varanops Some species were quite large, growing to a length of or more, although most species were much smaller. Well-known pelycosaurs include the genera Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, Edaphosaurus, and Ophiacodon. Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America, although some small, late- surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa. Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles, pelycosaurs lacked reptilian epidermal scales. Fossil evidence from some varanopids shows that parts of the skin were covered in rows of osteoderms, presumably overlain by horny scutes. The belly was covered in rectangular scutes, looking like those present in crocodiles. Parts of the skin not covered in scutes might have had naked, glandular skin like that found in some mammals. Dermal scutes are also found in a diverse number of extant mammals with conservative body types, such as in the tails of some rodents, sengis, moonrats, the opossums and other marsupials, and as regular dermal armour with underlying bone in the armadillo. At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail, consisting of elongated vertebral spines: the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids. In life, this would have been covered by skin, and likely functioned as a thermoregulatory device or as a mating display. ==Taxonomy== Eothyris Cotylorhynchus – a caseid Dimetrodon – a sphenacodontid In phylogenetic nomenclature, \\"Pelycosauria\\" is not used formally, since it does not constitute a group of all organisms descended from some common ancestor (a clade), because the group specifically excludes the therapsids which are descended from pelycosaurs. Instead, it represents a paraphyletic \\"grade\\" of basal synapsids leading up to the clade Therapsida. In 1940, the group was reviewed in detail, and every species known at the time described, with many illustrated, in an important monograph by Alfred Sherwood Romer and Llewellyn Price. In traditional classification, the order Pelycosauria is paraphyletic in that the therapsids (the \\"higher\\" synapsids) have emerged from them. That means Pelycosauria is a grouping of animals that does not contain all descendants of its common ancestor, as is often required by phylogenetic nomenclature. In evolutionary taxonomy, Therapsida is a separated order from Pelycosauria, and mammals (having evolved from therapsids) are separated from both as their own class. This use has not been continued by a majority of scientists since the 1990s. The following classification was presented by Benton in 2004. * Order Pelycosauria* ** Family Eothyrididae ** Family Caseidae ** Family Varanopidae ** Family Ophiacodontidae ** Family Edaphosauridae ** Family Sphenacodontidae * Order Therapsida ==See also== * Evolution of mammals * List of pelycosaurs * Vertebrate paleontology ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Paraphyletic groups ","title":"Pelycosaur"},{"id":"515373","text":"Memory protection is a way to control memory access rights on a computer, and is a part of most modern instruction set architectures and operating systems. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself. Protection may encompass all accesses to a specified area of memory, write accesses, or attempts to execute the contents of the area. An attempt to access unauthorized memory results in a hardware fault, e.g., a segmentation fault, storage violation exception, generally causing abnormal termination of the offending process. Memory protection for computer security includes additional techniques such as address space layout randomization and executable space protection. == Methods  Segmentation === Segmentation refers to dividing a computer's memory into segments. A reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset within that segment. The x86 architecture has multiple segmentation features, which are helpful for using protected memory on this architecture. On the x86 architecture, the Global Descriptor Table and Local Descriptor Tables can be used to reference segments in the computer's memory. Pointers to memory segments on x86 processors can also be stored in the processor's segment registers. Initially x86 processors had 4 segment registers, CS (code segment), SS (stack segment), DS (data segment) and ES (extra segment); later another two segment registers were added - FS and GS. === Paged virtual memory === In paging the memory address space or segment is divided into equal-sized blocks called pages. Using virtual memory hardware, each page can reside in any location at a suitable boundary of the computer's physical memory, or be flagged as being protected. Virtual memory makes it possible to have a linear virtual memory address space and to use it to access blocks fragmented over physical memory address space. Most computer architectures which support paging also use pages as the basis for memory protection. A page table maps virtual memory to physical memory. There may be a single page table, a page table for each process, a page table for each segment, or a hierarchy of page tables, depending on the architecture and the OS. The page tables are usually invisible to the process. Page tables make it easier to allocate additional memory, as each new page can be allocated from anywhere in physical memory. It is impossible for an unprivilged application to access a page that has not been explicitly allocated to it, because every memory address either points to a page allocated to that application, or generates an interrupt called a page fault. Unallocated pages, and pages allocated to any other application, do not have any addresses from the application point of view. A page fault may not necessarily indicate an error. Page faults are not only used for memory protection. The operating system may manage the page table in such a way that a reference to a page that has been previously swapped out to disk causes a page fault. The operating system intercepts the page fault, loads the required memory page, and the application continues as if no fault had occurred. This scheme, known as virtual memory, allows in-memory data not currently in use to be moved to disk storage and back in a way which is transparent to applications, to increase overall memory capacity. On some systems, the page fault mechanism is also used for executable space protection such as W^X. === Protection keys === A memory protection key (MPK)Memory protection keys, Jonathan Corbet, May 13, 2015, LWN.net mechanism divides physical memory into blocks of a particular size (e.g., 4 KiB), each of which has an associated numerical value called a protection key. Each process also has a protection key value associated with it. On a memory access the hardware checks that the current process's protection key matches the value associated with the memory block being accessed; if not, an exception occurs. This mechanism was introduced in the System/360 architecture. It is available on today's System z mainframes and heavily used by System z operating systems and their subsystems. The System/360 protection keys described above are associated with physical addresses. This is different from the protection key mechanism used by architectures such as the Hewlett-Packard/Intel IA-64 and Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC, which are associated with virtual addresses, and which allow multiple keys per process. In the Itanium and PA-RISC architectures, translations (TLB entries) have keys (Itanium) or access ids (PA-RISC) associated with them. A running process has several protection key registers (16 for Itanium, 4 for PA-RISC). A translation selected by the virtual address has its key compared to each of the protection key registers. If any of them match (plus other possible checks), the access is permitted. If none match, a fault or exception is generated. The software fault handler can, if desired, check the missing key against a larger list of keys maintained by software; thus, the protection key registers inside the processor may be treated as a software-managed cache of a larger list of keys associated with a process. PA-RISC has 15–18 bits of key; Itanium mandates at least 18. Keys are usually associated with protection domains, such as libraries, modules, etc. In the x86, the protection keys architecture allows tagging virtual addresses for user pages with any of 16 protection keys. All the pages tagged with the same protection key constitute a protection domain. A new register contains the permissions associated with each of the protection domain. Load and store operations are checked against both the page table permissions and the protection key permissions associated with the protection domain of the virtual address, and only allowed if both permissions allow the access. The protection key permissions can be set from user space, allowing applications to directly restrict access to the application data without OS intervention. Since the protection keys are associated with a virtual address, the protection domains are per address space, so processes running in different address spaces can each use all 16 domains. === Protection rings === In Multics and systems derived from it, each segment has a protection ring for reading, writing and execution; an attempt by a process with a higher ring number than the ring number for the segment causes a fault. There is a mechanism for safely calling procedures that run in a lower ring and returning to the higher ring. There are mechanisms for a routine running with a low ring number to access a parameter with the larger of its own ring and the caller's ring. === Simulated segmentation === Simulation is the use of a monitoring program to interpret the machine code instructions of some computer architectures. Such an instruction set simulator can provide memory protection by using a segmentation-like scheme and validating the target address and length of each instruction in real time before actually executing them. The simulator must calculate the target address and length and compare this against a list of valid address ranges that it holds concerning the thread's environment, such as any dynamic memory blocks acquired since the thread's inception, plus any valid shared static memory slots. The meaning of \\"valid\\" may change throughout the thread's life depending upon context. It may sometimes be allowed to alter a static block of storage, and sometimes not, depending upon the current mode of execution, which may or may not depend on a storage key or supervisor state. It is generally not advisable to use this method of memory protection where adequate facilities exist on a CPU, as this takes valuable processing power from the computer. However, it is generally used for debugging and testing purposes to provide an extra fine level of granularity to otherwise generic storage violations and can indicate precisely which instruction is attempting to overwrite the particular section of storage which may have the same storage key as unprotected storage. === Capability-based addressing === Capability- based addressing is a method of memory protection that is unused in modern commercial computers. In this method, pointers are replaced by protected objects (called capabilities) that can only be created using privileged instructions which may only be executed by the kernel, or some other process authorized to do so. This effectively lets the kernel control which processes may access which objects in memory, with no need to use separate address spaces or context switches. Only a few commercial products used capability based security: Plessey System 250, IBM System/38, Intel iAPX 432 architecture and KeyKOS. Capability approaches are widely used in research systems such as EROS and Combex DARPA browser. They are used conceptually as the basis for some virtual machines, most notably Smalltalk and Java. Currently, the DARPA- funded CHERI project at University of Cambridge is working to create a modern capability machine that also supports legacy software. === Dynamic tainting === Dynamic tainting is a technique for protecting programs from illegal memory accesses. When memory is allocated, at runtime, this technique taints both the memory and the corresponding pointer using the same taint mark. Taint marks are then suitably propagated while the program executes and are checked every time a memory address m is accessed through a pointer p; if the taint marks associated with m and p differ, the execution is stopped and the illegal access is reported. SPARC M7 processors (and higher) implement dynamic tainting in hardware. Oracle markets this feature as Silicon Secured Memory (SSM) (previously branded as Application Data Integrity (ADI)). The lowRISC CPU design includes dynamic tainting under the name Tagged Memory. == Measures == The protection level of a particular implementation may be measured by how closely it adheres to the principle of minimum privilege.Cook, D.J. Measuring memory protection, accepted for 3rd International Conference on Software Engineering, Atlanta, Georgia, May 1978. == Memory protection in different operating systems == Different operating systems use different forms of memory protection or separation. Although memory protection was common on most mainframes and many minicomputer systems from the 1960s, true memory separation was not used in home computer operating systems until OS/2 (and in RISC OS) was released in 1987. On prior systems, such lack of protection was even used as a form of interprocess communication, by sending a pointer between processes. It is possible for processes to access System Memory in the Windows 9x family of Operating Systems. Some operating systems that do implement memory protection include: * Unix-like systems (since the late 1970s), including Solaris, Linux, BSD, macOS, iOS and GNU Hurd * Plan9 and Inferno, created at Bell Labs as Unix successors (1992, 1995) * OS/2 (1987) * RISC OS (1987) (The OS memory protection is not comprehensive.) * Microware OS-9, as an optional module (since 1992) * Microsoft Windows family from Windows NT 3.1 (1993) * Atari MultiTOS (since 1991) * Pharoshttps://sourceforge.net/projects/rtospharos/ (since 2017) On Unix-like systems, the \`mprotect\` system call is used to control memory protection. == See also == * Storage violation, for violation of memory protection * Separation of protection and security * Memory management (operating systems) == References == == Notes == == External links == * Intel Developer Manuals in-depth information on memory protection for Intel-based architectures Category:Memory management ","title":"Memory protection"},{"id":"515380","text":"Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of platelets, also known as thrombocytes, in the blood. A normal human platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Values outside this range do not necessarily indicate disease. One common definition of thrombocytopenia requiring emergency treatment is a platelet count below 50,000 per microliter. Thrombocytopenia can be contrasted with thrombocythemia, and thrombocytosis, conditions of an abnormally high level of platelets in the blood. (Thrombocythemia when the cause is unknown; thrombocytosis when the cause is known). ==Signs and symptoms== Petechia on the lower leg from thrombocytopenia Right upper limb with purpura caused by thrombocytopenia in person with septic shock Thrombocytopenia usually has no symptoms and is picked up on a routine complete blood count. Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding such as nosebleeds, or bleeding gums. Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. Bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms and petechiae in the feet, legs, and mucous membranes, may be caused by spontaneous bleeding under the skin. Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not secondary to another disorder. Ensuring that the other blood cell types, such as red blood cells and white blood cells are not also suppressed, is also important. Painless, round, and pinpoint (1 to 3 mm in diameter) petechiae usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form ecchymoses. Larger than petechiae, ecchymoses are purple, blue, or yellow-green areas of skin that vary in size and shape. They can occur anywhere on the body. A person with this disease may also complain of malaise, fatigue, and general weakness (with or without accompanying blood loss). Acquired thrombocytopenia may be associated with the use of certain drugs. Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding (petechiae or ecchymoses), along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled bullae in the mouth. If the person's platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/mm3, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/mm3, spontaneous bruising will be seen (mostly on the arms and legs). ==Causes== Thrombocytopenia can be inherited or acquired. ===Decreased production=== Abnormally low platelet production may be caused by: * Dehydration, Vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency * Leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or aplastic anemia * Decreased production of thrombopoietin by the liver in liver failure * Sepsis, systemic viral or bacterial infection * Leptospirosis * Hereditary syndromesAlmazni I, Stapley R, Morgan NV (2019) Inherited Thrombocytopenia: Update on genes and genetic variants which may be associated With bleeding. Front Cardiovasc Med ** ACTN1-related thrombocytopenia ** Alport syndrome ** Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia with radio-ulnar synostosis ** ANKRD26 related thrombocytopenia ** Autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia ** Bernard–Soulier syndrome (associated with large platelets) ** Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia ** Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and radioulnar synostosis ** CYCS-related thrombocytopenia ** ETV6 related thrombocytopenia ** Fanconi anemia ** Filaminopathies A ** FYB related thrombocytopenia ** Glanzmann's thrombasthenia ** GNE myopathy with congenital thrombocytopenia ** Gray platelet syndrome ** Macrothrombocytopenia and hearing loss ** May–Hegglin anomaly ** MYH9-related disease ** PRKACG-related thrombocytopenia ** Paris-Trousseau thrombocytopenia/Jacobsen syndrome ** SLFN14-related thrombocytopenia ** Stormorken syndrome ** TRPM7-related thrombocytopenia ** Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome ** Tropomyosin 4-related thrombocytopenia ** TUBB1-related thrombocytopenia ** Upshaw–Schulman syndrome ** Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome ** X-linked thrombocytopenia ** X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia ===Increased destruction=== TTP Abnormally high rates of platelet destruction may be due to immune or nonimmune conditions, including: * Immune thrombocytopenic purpura * Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura * Hemolytic–uremic syndrome * Disseminated intravascular coagulation * Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria * Antiphospholipid syndrome * Systemic lupus erythematosus * Post-transfusion purpura * Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia * Hypersplenism * Dengue fever * Gaucher's disease * Zika virus ===Medication-induced=== These medications can induce thrombocytopenia through direct myelosuppression: * Valproic acid * Methotrexate * Carboplatin * Interferon * Isotretinoin * Panobinostat * H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors ===Other causes=== * Lab error, possibly due to the anticoagulant EDTA in CBC specimen tubes; a citrated platelet count is a useful follow-up study * Snakebite * Niacin toxicity * Lyme disease * Thrombocytapheresis (also called plateletpheresis) * Niemann–Pick diseasehttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/niemann-pick/symptoms- causes/syc-20355887 ==Diagnosis== Laboratory tests for thrombocytopenia might include full blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, vitamin B12 levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral blood smear. If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, a bone marrow biopsy is usually recommended to differentiate cases of decreased platelet production from cases of peripheral platelet destruction. Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized alcoholics may be caused by spleen enlargement, folate deficiency, and most frequently, the direct toxic effect of alcohol on production, survival time, and function of platelets. Platelet count begins to rise after 2 to 5 days' abstinence from alcohol. The condition is generally benign, and clinically significant hemorrhage is rare. In severe thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow study can determine the number, size, and maturity of the megakaryocytes. This information may identify ineffective platelet production as the cause of thrombocytopenia and rule out a malignant disease process at the same time. ==Treatment== Treatment is guided by the severity and specific cause of the disease. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing drugs suspected to cause it or treating underlying sepsis. Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a hematologist. Corticosteroids may be used to increase platelet production. Lithium carbonate or folate may also be used to stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow. === Platelet transfusions === Platelet transfusions may be suggested for people that have a low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia. ===Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura=== Treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a medical emergency, since the associated hemolytic anemia and platelet activation can lead to kidney failure and changes in the level of consciousness. Treatment of TTP was revolutionized in the 1980s with the application of plasmapheresis. According to the Furlan-Tsai hypothesis, this treatment works by removing antibodies against the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS-13. The plasmapheresis procedure also adds active ADAMTS-13 protease proteins to the patient, restoring a normal level of von Willebrand factor multimers. Patients with persistent antibodies against ADAMTS-13 do not always manifest TTP, and these antibodies alone are not sufficient to explain how plasmapheresis treats TTP. ===Immune thrombocytopenic purpura=== Oral petechiae/purpura - Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Many cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, can be left untreated, and spontaneous remission (especially in children) is not uncommon. However, counts under 50,000 are usually monitored with regular blood tests, and those with counts under 10,000 are usually treated, as the risk of serious spontaneous bleeding is high with such low platelet counts. Any patient experiencing severe bleeding symptoms is also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s; hematologists recognize that patients rarely spontaneously bleed with platelet counts greater than 10,000, although exceptions to this observation have been documented. Thrombopoetin analogues have been tested extensively for the treatment of ITP. These agents had previously shown promise, but had been found to stimulate antibodies against endogenous thrombopoietin or lead to thrombosis. Romiplostim (trade name Nplate, formerly AMG 531) was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients, especially those who relapsed following splenectomy. ===Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia=== Discontinuation of heparin is critical in a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Beyond that, however, clinicians generally treat to avoid thrombosis. Treatment may include a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as lepirudin or argatroban. Other blood thinners sometimes used in this setting include bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Platelet transfusions are not routinely used to treat HIT because thrombosis, not bleeding, is the primary problem. Warfarin is not recommended until platelets have normalized. ===Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia=== Bone marrow/stem cell transplants are the only known cures for this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death before the transplant can be performed, although this is not always the case. === Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived platelets === Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived platelets is a technology currently being researched by the private sector, in association with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, that would create platelets outside the human body. ==Neonatal thrombocytopenia== Thrombocytopenia affects a few newborns, and its prevalence in neonatal intensive care units is high. Normally, it is mild and resolves without consequences. Most cases affect preterm birth infants and result from placental insufficiency and/or fetal hypoxia. Other causes, such as alloimmunity, genetics, autoimmunity, and infection, are less frequent. Thrombocytopenia that starts after the first 72 hours since birth is often the result of underlying sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis. In the case of infection, PCR tests may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes. Possible pathogens include viruses (e.g. cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, HIV), bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), fungi (e.g. Candida spp.), and Toxoplasma gondii. The severity of thrombocytopenia may be correlated with pathogen type; some research indicates that the most severe cases are related to fungal or Gram-negative bacterial infection. The pathogen may be transmitted during or before birth, by breast feeding, or during transfusion. Interleukin-11 is being investigated as a drug for managing thrombocytopenia, especially in cases of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). ==References== == External links == Category:Coagulopathies Category:Medical signs Category:Hematopathology ","title":"Thrombocytopenia"},{"id":"515382","text":"Beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In accelerator physics, a beamline refers to the trajectory of the beam of accelerated particles, including the overall construction of the path segment (guide tubes, diagnostic devices) along a specific path of an accelerator facility. This part is either * the line in a linear accelerator along which a beam of particles travels, or * the path leading from particle generator (e.g. a cyclic accelerator) to the experimental endstation (as in synchrotron light sources, cyclotrons, or spallation sources). Beamlines usually end in experimental stations that utilize particle beams or synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron, or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor. Beamlines are used in experiments in particle physics, materials science, chemistry, and molecular biology, but can also be used for irradiation tests or to produce isotopes. ==Beamline in a particle accelerator== It is impossible to see the beam pipe on this beamline. However the section of the big beam pipe is used with a grid system for alignment with a laser, known as the laser pipe. This particular beamline is approximately 3 kilometers long. In particle accelerators the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a concrete housing for shielding purposes. The beamline is usually a cylindrical metal pipe, typically called a beam pipe, and/or a drift tube, evacuated to a high vacuum so there are few gas molecules in the path for the beam of accelerated particles to hit, which otherwise could scatter them before they reach their destination. There are specialized devices and equipment on the beamline that are used for producing, maintaining, monitoring, and accelerating the particle beam. These devices may be in proximity of or attached directly to the beamline. These devices include sophisticated transducers, diagnostics (position monitors and wire scanners), lenses, collimators, thermocouples, ion pumps, ion gauges, ion chambers (for diagnostic purposes; usually called \\"beam monitors\\"), vacuum valves (\\"isolation valves\\"), and gate valves, to mention a few. It is imperative to have all beamline sections, magnets, etc., aligned (often by a survey and an alignment crew by using a laser tracker), beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation. ==Synchrotron radiation beamline== The exposed workings of a soft x-ray beamline and endstation at the Australian Synchrotron Inside the Optical Diagnostic Beamline (ODB) hutch at the Australian Synchrotron; the beamline terminates at the small aperture in the back wall Regarding synchrotrons, beamline may also refer to the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron radiation facility. A typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography, although many other techniques utilising synchrotron light exist. At a large synchrotron facility there will be many beamlines, each optimised for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station. A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron facility will be 25 to 100 m long from the storage ring to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines opening on day one of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits. The beamline elements are located in radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. Entrance to the hutches is forbidden when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. This is enforced by the use of elaborate safety systems with redundant interlocking functions, which make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is dumped, meaning the stored beam is diverted into a target designed to absorb and contain its energy. Elements that are used in beamlines by experimenters for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station include the following: *Windows - thin sheets of metal, often beryllium, which transmit almost all of the beam, but protect the vacuum within the storage ring from contamination *Slits - which control the physical width of the beam and its angular spread *Focusing mirrors - one or more mirrors, which may be flat, bent-flat, or toroidal, which helps to collimate (focus) the beam *Monochromators - devices based on diffraction by crystals which select particular wavelength bands and absorb other wavelengths, and which are sometimes tunable to varying wavelengths, and sometimes fixed to a particular wavelength *Spacing tubes - vacuum maintaining tubes which provide the proper space between optical elements, and shield any scattered radiation *Sample stages - for mounting and manipulating the sample under study and subjecting it to various external conditions, such a varying temperature, pressure etc. *Radiation detectors - for measuring the radiation which has interacted with the sample The combination of beam conditioning devices controls the thermal load (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or liquid nitrogen. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under ultra high vacuum conditions. ===Software for beamline modeling=== Although the design of a synchrotron radiation beamline may be seen as an application of X-ray optics, there are dedicated tools for modeling the x-ray propagation down the beamline and their interaction with various components. There are ray-tracing codes such as Shadow and McXTrace that treat the x-ray beam in the geometric optics limit, and then there are wave propagation software that takes into account diffraction, and the intrinsic wavelike properties of the radiation. For the purposes of understanding full or partial coherence of the synchrotron radiation, the wave properties need to be taken into account. The codes SRW, Spectra and xrt include this possibility, the latter code supports \\"hybryd\\" regime allowing to switch from geometric to wave approach on a given optical segment. ==Neutron beamline== Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a research reactor or a spallation source instead of photons. Since neutrons don't carry charge and are difficult to redirect, the components are quite different (see e.g. choppers or neutron super mirrors). The experiments usually measure neutron scattering from or energy transfer to the sample under study. == See also == * Ion beam * :Category:Neutron facilities * Klystron ==References== ==External links== * Macromolecular Crystallography at Synchrotrons: An Historical Introduction Category:Accelerator physics Category:Synchrotron instrumentation Category:Neutron instrumentation Category:Materials science Beamline ","title":"Beamline"},{"id":"515386","text":"An F-4G with WW payload; near to far: AGM-88 HARM, AGM-65 Maverick, ALQ-119 ECM pod, AGM-78 Standard ARM and AGM-45 Shrike, circa 1981. Wild Weasel patch. The letters at the bottom stand for \\"You gotta be shitting me.\\" Wild Weasel is a code name given by the United States Armed Forces, specifically the US Air Force, to an aircraft, of any type, equipped with anti-radiation missiles and tasked with the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses: destroying the radar and Surface-to-Air Missile installations of enemy air defense systems.Hewitt, W.A. \\"Planting the seeds of SEAD: The Wild Weasel in Vietnam.\\" School of Advanced Airpower Studies, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, PhD Thesis. May 1992. Accessed 5 October 2009. \\"The first Wild Weasel success came soon after the first Wild Weasel mission 20 December 1965 when Captains Al Lamb and Jack Donovan took out a site during a Rolling Thunder strike on the railyard at Yen Bai, some 75 miles northwest of Hanoi.\\" The Wild Weasel concept was developed by the United States Air Force in 1965, after the introduction of Soviet SAMs and their downing of U.S. strike aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam.Davies p. 4, 5 The program was headed by General Kenneth Dempster. Wild Weasel tactics and techniques began their development in 1965 following the commencement of Operation Rolling Thunder during the Vietnam War, and were later adapted by other nations during following conflicts, as well as being integrated into the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), a plan used by U.S. air forces to establish immediate air supremacy prior to possible full- scale conflict. Initially known by the operational code \\"Iron Hand\\" when first authorized on 12 August 1965, the term \\"Wild Weasel\\" derives from Project Wild Weasel, the USAF development program for a dedicated SAM-detection and suppression aircraft. The technique was also called an \\"Iron Hand\\" mission, though technically this term referred only to the suppression attack before the main strike.Iron Hand (National Museum of the United States Air Force website. Accessed 26 January 2009.)) Originally named \\"Project Ferret\\", denoting a predatory animal that goes into its prey's den to kill it (hence: \\"to ferret out\\"), the name was changed to differentiate it from the code-name \\"Ferret\\" that had been used during World War II for radar counter-measures bombers. In brief, the task of a Wild Weasel aircraft is to bait enemy anti- aircraft defenses into targeting it with their radars, whereupon the radar waves are traced back to their source, allowing the Weasel or its teammates to precisely target it for destruction. A simple analogy is playing the game of \\"flashlight tag\\" in the dark; a flashlight is usually the only reliable means of identifying someone in order to \\"tag\\" (destroy) them, but the light immediately renders the bearer able to be identified and attacked as well. The result is a hectic game of cat-and-mouse in which the radar \\"flashlights\\" are rapidly cycled on and off in an attempt to identify and kill the target before the target is able to home in on the emitted radar \\"light\\" and destroy the site. The modern term used in the U.S. Armed Forces for this mission profile is \\"Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses\\", or SEAD. ==EquipmentWild Weasel I=== The Wild Weasel concept was originally proposed in 1965 as a method of countering the increasing North Vietnamese SAM threat, using volunteer crews flying the two-seat F model of the F-100 Super Sabre; while the United States Navy primarily relied upon the A-4 Skyhawk.Michel III p. 35Hobson p. 43 While an effective airframe, the F-100F Wild Weasel did not have the performance characteristics to survive in a high threat environment. The first Wild Weasel squadron was the 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron based at Takhli Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand. After 45 days of operations against North Vietnamese targets, the 354th had one airplane left and of the 16 aircrew members, four had been killed, two were POW's, three had been wounded and two had quit. ===Wild Weasel II and III=== The Wild Weasel II version was the first unsuccessful attempt to use the F-4C as a Wild Weasel platform. When that effort failed, the Wild Weasel role was then passed to the F-105F in the summer of 1966. The F-105F was converted for the role and was designated Wild Weasel III. The F-105F was equipped with more advanced radar, jamming equipment, and a heavier armament. Anti-radiation missiles were outfitted that could seek out radar emplacements. The F-105F Wild Weasel airframes were eventually modified with improved countermeasures components in a standardized configuration and designated the F-105G. The F-105G was also designated Wild Weasel III; 61 F-105F units were upgraded to F-105G specifications. Although in some documentation the F-105F was referred to as an EF-105F, that designation never existed in the operational flying squadrons. ===Wild Weasel IV=== The F-105 was no longer in production by 1964. With severe combat attrition of the F-105 inventory, the need for a more sophisticated aircraft resulted in the conversion of 36 F-4C Phantom II aircraft, designated F-4C Wild Weasel IV. The F-4C Wild Weasel IV was also not designated as an EF-4C. ===Wild Weasel V=== The F-4E, the most advanced Phantom variant with extensive ground-attack capabilities and an internal gun, became the basis for the F-4G Wild Weasel V (also known as the Advanced Wild Weasel). This modification consisted of removing the gun and replacing it with the APR-38(t) Radar Homing and Warning Receiver (later upgraded to the APR-47), and a cockpit upgrade for the back seat to manage the electronic combat environment. A total of 134 F-4G models were converted from F-4Es with the first one flying in 1975. Squadron service began in 1978. F-4Gs were deployed to three active wings. One was stationed at George AFB, Victorville, California, as part of the Rapid Deployment Force; one wing was assigned to USAFE (US Air Forces in Europe) at Spangdahlem AB, Germany; and the other to PACAF (Pacific Air Forces) at Clark AB, Philippines. F-4Gs from George AFB, Clark AB and Spangdahlem AB saw combat during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, successfully protecting strike packages from enemy air defenses. During this conflict the F-4G saw heavy use, with only a single loss: an aircraft from Spangdahlem AB crashed in Saudi Arabia while returning from a mission, after one of the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles hang fired which left the aircraft's instruments not displaying the correct altitude information and a significant frame tweak from the damage made the plane hard to control. After an investigation into the loss of the aircraft which occurred during several aborted landing attempts in a sandstorm, it was determined that a fuel cell was punctured by anti-aircraft fire. The pilot and EWO safely ejected after the engines shut down when the aircraft ran out of fuel attempting to land at a forward airstrip. After Desert Storm, some of the George AFB aircraft were assigned to the 124th Wing of the Air National Guard at Boise, Idaho, 190th Fighter Squadron. Aircraft from Spangdahlem, Clark, and the remainder from George were assigned to the 561st Fighter Squadron, 57th Fighter Wing (Active Duty) at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas. The aircraft remained in service until 1996, with both squadrons participating in frequent deployments to Saudi Arabia and Turkey in support of Operation Provide Comfort, Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Vigilant Warrior enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq. By this time the F-4G was the last operational variant of the Phantom II in the US forces. Many of the airframes were later used as target drones and Aircraft Battle Damage Repair training aids. ===Current=== An F-16CJ of the 20th Fighter Wing. A change in aircraft design theory to stress versatile multi-role aircraft meant that the F-4G Phantom was the last aircraft in the USAF inventory specifically outfitted for the SEAD role. The Wild Weasel mission is now assigned to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, using the Block 50 and Block 52, with production beginning in 1991. The single-seat Block 50/52 F-16C is specifically tasked with this mission. The pilot now performs both the role of flying the airplane and targeting and employing against ground threats. Other aircraft, while capable of taking out anti-air emplacements, are typically tasked with other primary missions; the A-10 Thunderbolt II \\"Warthog\\", primarily tasked with CAS missions, lacks the avionics to perform a true SEAD mission and does not carry the AGM-88 HARM.The F-16C is the only aircraft in the Air Force current inventory to use the AGM-88. https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact- Sheets/Display/Article/104574/agm-88-harm/ The F-15E Strike Eagle, possessing advanced air-to-ground avionics but also high speed and long range, is typically tasked with \\"deep strike\\" missions, which can include SAM installations but typically focuses on high-value targets such as enemy command & control, infrastructure and production, and likewise does not carry HARM. The Tornado ECR variant is dedicated to SEAD missions and is currently operated by the German Air Force and Italian Air Force. The Royal Air Force used the GR4 variant to conduct similar missions utilising the ALARM missile, though they were mainly used in the interdiction/CAS role. The RAF retired the ALARM missile in 2013 and retired the Tornado in 2019. The F-35 Lightning II is slated to gradually replace these aircraft for various air-to-ground roles, including SEAD, beginning with its introduction in 2016. Its stealth capabilities promise a significant increase in effectiveness against air- defence radars, though to maintain its lowest radar signature, its payload capacity would be limited to the internal weapons bays, reducing the number of missile site attacks per sortie. However, it can carry more or larger air to ground weapons internally than even the F-22 and is more advanced in a ground attack capacity, potentially making it the best manned aircraft for destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses.However, it cannot carry dedicated anti- radiation missiles such as the AGM-88 HARM internally, negating much of its stealth advantage in a dedicated SEAD/DEAD role. Gates: Future Jet Supporters are Risking Today’s Troops ==Mission tactics== F-105 Thunderchief Wild Weasel. In 1966 over North Vietnam, Wild Weasel flights of four aircraft sometimes were led by a single F-105F/G two-seat aircraft (aided by its Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) with his electronic receivers & analyzers) plus three F-105Ds. Sometimes two \\"F\\"s, each with a \\"D\\" wingman, operated independently. The Wild Weasel mission was to precede strike flights, sanitizing the target area of radar guided Surface-to-Air Missile threats (predominantly SA-2 'Guideline' systems), leaving the threat area last, which sometimes would result in 3.5-hour missions, before returning to Royal Thai Air Force Bases. This was achieved by turning toward the air defense site in a threatening manner, firing radar homing missiles at the site, or visually locating the site to dive bomb it. These tactics were attempted while under attack by MiGs and anti-aircraft artillery. The F-105F did not use radar jamming devices since its purpose was to provide a decoy target, protecting the strike flights, and encouraging SAM launches that generated enough bright smoke to make possible seeing the SAM site for immediate dive bombing attack. With multiple incoming missiles in visual sight it was possible to dive abruptly or sharply break to avoid them. Failure to see the missiles approaching at three times fighter cruise speed would result in the destruction of the aircraft and failure of the mission. Vietnam War tactics of using \\"Hunter-Killer\\" teams,Davies p. 4, 5, 64, 68 where an F-4G Wild Weasel would be teamed with one or more conventional F-4E Phantoms, were improved upon with the newer equipment. The Wild Weasel would destroy missile radar emitters, clearing the way for the F-4E's to destroy the rest of the missile site using cluster munitions. A tactic used during Operation Desert Storm was known as \\"Here, kitty kitty\\", wherein one Weasel would get the attention of a SAM or anti- aircraft artillery site while other Weasels would then sneak up behind the site and destroy it. In one of the Wild Weasel concept's most famous uses in military operations, five F-105Gs, using the call-signs \\"Firebird 01–05\\", provided support for the Son Tay P.O.W. Rescue Mission, which was conducted in the early morning hours of 21 November 1970. One of these aircraft was shot down by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile, but its crew ejected safely and was rescued by the HH-53 \\"Super Jolly\\" helicopters that also participated in the raid. None of the aircraft of the raiding force protected by Wild Weasels was lost to enemy action. ==Motto and traditions== The unofficial motto of the Wild Weasel crews is YGBSM: \\"You Gotta Be Shittin' Me\\". This appears prominently on the logo patch of some squadrons. As the story goes, this was the response of Jack Donovan, a former B-52 EWO (Electronic Warfare Officer): > This was the natural response of an educated man, a veteran EWO on B-52s and > the like, upon learning that he was to fly back seat to a self-absorbed > fighter pilot while acting as flypaper for enemy SAMs.In Their Own Words #8: > Eleven Stories For Veterans Day – Lt Col Allen Lamb, USAF (ret.), (via > 'edefense.blogspot.com'), Friday, 11 November 2005. Accessed 26 January > 2009.Dinner speech by Joe Shriber (held at the 27 April 2000 event of the > Golden Gate Wing. Accessed 26 January 2009.) His exact words were: \\"I'm gonna fly with you, and we're gonna shoot a SAM site before it shoots us? You gotta be shittin' me!\\" The motto \\"First in, Last out\\" was also used. The \\"WW\\" tailcode of the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing and the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing derives from their Wild Weasel heritage. ==See also== * Operation Iron Hand The US Navy equivalent to the Wild Weasel operation * Anti-radiation missile * Active radar homing * Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses * Panavia Tornado ECR * List of U.S. Department of Defense code names ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * Broughton, J.

It borders the provinces of Buenos Aires (south), Corrientes (north) and Santa Fe (west), and Uruguay in the east. Its capital is Paraná (250,000 inhabitants), which lies on the Paraná River, opposite the city of Santa Fe. Together with Córdoba and Santa Fe, since 1999, the province is part of the economic-political association known as the Center Region. ==History== San José Palace, home of the first President of modern Argentina, Justo José de Urquiza The first inhabitants of the area that is now Entre Ríos were the Charrúa and Chaná who each occupied separate parts of the region. Spaniards entered in 1520, when Rodríguez Serrano ventured up the Uruguay River searching for the Pacific Ocean. The first permanent Spanish settlement was erected in the current La Paz Department at the end of the 16th century. As governor of Asunción first and then of Buenos Aires, Hernandarias conducted expeditions to Entre Ríos unexplored lands. Juan de Garay, after founding Santa Fe, explored this area, which he called la otra banda (\\"the other bank\\"). However, the region remained entirely indigenous and uninhabited by Europeans until a group of colonists from neighbouring Santa Fe Province settled on the Bajada del Paraná in the late seventeenth century, now the site of the provincial capital. At the same time towns appear, which we now know as Nogoyá, Victoria, Gualeguay, Gualeguaychú, Concepción del Uruguay and Concordia. Tomás de Rocamora further explored the area in 1783 under the threat of a Portuguese invasion from Brazil, and gave official status to many of the above-mentioned towns. He was also the first to refer to the region as Entre Ríos. At this stage, European settlement was minimal, though during the May Revolution, the few colonists in the cities along the Paraná shore supported Manuel Belgrano and his army on his way to Paraguay. On September 29, 1820, the leader (caudillo) Francisco Ramírez declared the territory an autonomous entity, the Republic of Entre Ríos. This lasted until his assassination on July 10 of the next year. In 1853, in a meeting of all the provinces except Buenos Aires, Paraná was elected as the capital of the Argentine Confederation, and the Governor of Entre Ríos and leader (caudillo) Urquiza as its first president. The provincial capital was moved to Concepción del Uruguay. Later Urquiza, who had first won against Buenos Aires at the Battle of Cepeda in 1859, let his troops move back in the even Battle of Pavón in 1861, which allowed his rival Bartolomé Mitre from Buenos Aires to become president. At the time he was fulfilling his third term as governor of the province from 1860 to 1864 and after a voluntary interruption was reelected in 1886, but he was assassinated in 1870 after altogether 16 years of governing before finishing his mandate, which had probably been ordered by his supportor Ricardo López Jordán, not trusting him anymore. Urquiza encouraged immigration through \\"colonization contracts\\", setting up many agricultural colonies with European (mainly Volga Germans, Russians (including Russian Jews and Poles), Italians, Swiss and French) settlers. According to data of the 1903 census, of the 425,373 inhabitants of the province, 153,067 were immigrants. ==Economy== Hotel Mayorazgo, Paraná. Entre Rios' economy is the sixth largest in Argentina. Its output in 2006 was estimated at US$7.71 billion, or, US$6,710 per capita in 2006 (about a fourth less than the national average). In 2013, its output was estimated at $63.814 billon Pesos (about US$11.688 billion) or, 48,327 pesos (about US$8,851) per capita at current market prices.The average exchange for 1 US dollar was 5.46 Argentine pesos in 2013 according to the World Bank This was 21% below the average GDP per capita of 69,678 pesos (about US$12,762) for Argentina in 2013 at current market prices. Its economy has long been more agricultural than the median in Argentina, comprising about 15% of output. Entre Rios' agricultural products include rice (60% of the national production), soybeans, wheat, maize, and citrus of which it is the second biggest producer, and exporting 16% of the production mainly to Europe. Livestock production focuses on cattle (4.5 million head), and in sheep production in a decreasing proportion, covering 60,000 km². The dairy industry, currently in expansion, produces almost 250 thousand tons per year of dairy products. Of the national production of chickens and eggs, Entre Ríos contributes 37% of the first and 25% percent of the second. Another emerging production is honey and its derivatives, mainly for export. Manufacturing has a sizable presence in Entre Rios, making up another 15% of output. Its industries are mostly linked to agriculture, as in food and drinks industry and flour and rice mills. Other industries include timber-wood, chemical, metallurgy, and machinery. ==Geography== Boats on the Uruguay River, Colón. As part of the Mesopotamic region, the land is almost completely flat, with hills some 100 meters in height. There are two main systems of low hills, called lomadas or cuchillas: the Cuchilla de Montiel (west) and the Cuchilla Grande (east), which are separated by the Gualeguay River. The name of the province means \\"between rivers\\". Entre Ríos is limited and traversed by many rivers and streams: the Paraná River and its delta to the west and south; the Uruguay River and the Mocoretá River to the east; and the Guayquiraró River to the north. Two national parks are located within the province: El Palmar National Park and Predelta National Park. There are also hot springs in several locations, especially along the basin of the Uruguay River, located in cities like Federación, Villa Elisa, Colón, etc. ===Climate=== Köppen climate map of Entre Ríos Province The province is divided into 2 climatic regions: The first one is a humid, temperate climate that covers most of the central and southern parts of the province. Mean temperatures range from in winter to in summer while the mean annual precipitation in this region is . The second climatic region is a subtropical climate located in the northern parts of the province where mean temperatures range from in winter to in summer. Winters are more shorter while precipitation is higher, averaging per year. == Government == Legislature of Entre Ríos The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The legislative branch is a bicameral body composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing local laws. The Constitution of Entre Ríos Province forms the formal law of the province. In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Entre Ríos Provincial Police. ==Political division== Pelay Beach on the Uruguay River, Concepción del Uruguay.

The series is characterized by its dark humour, frequent shifts in animation styles, and handling of taboo topics such as bestiality, murder, suicide and paedophilia. Three series were broadcast on BBC Three between 2003 and 2005. Following co-creator Harry Thompson's death, no further series were made. ==Episodes== Each episode featured animation by several different companies including Slinky Pictures, Nexus Productions, Sherbet Animation, Caroline Mabey, Picasso Pictures, and VooDooDog, but is linked by recurring themes/jokes and seamless transitions between sketches. The episodes are untitled but instead are known by the characters introduced or the one-off sketches included. The principal writers and creators of the series were Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye, although other contributors were responsible for a significant proportion of the work; sometimes collaborating with Thompson and/or Pye; sometimes contributing fully formed sketches to the show. A short overview of the main characters, called a nocturne, set in the various characters' bedrooms with no dialogue and a depressing accompanying song, usually precedes the final section. ==Music== The animation in each episode is accompanied by contemporary music which helps the transition between scenes. Numerous songs by Goldfrapp, Boards of Canada and Black Box Recorder. The theme music for all three series is by Eels (\\"That's Not Really Funny\\" from Souljacker). The inclusion of music from Goldfrapp during the first series would have pre-dated the commercial release of their debut album, but production on the series took so long that by the time of airing, Goldfrapp were about to release their second album. Thompson and Pye comment on this in the Series 1 DVD commentary. Ben River contributed a song he wrote and produced in collaboration with singer Rosamund Daegenhardt. It appeared in series 3, episode 6. ==Release== On 8 November 2004, the first series of Monkey Dust was released in the UK on DVD. Several musical substitutions had to be made from the television airing, as artists such as Cliff Richard and David Gray would not allow their work to be used on the DVD. Cover versions of the original songs were used instead. The second and third series were broadcast on BBC Two and BBC Three respectively. Only the first series of Monkey Dust was commercially released on DVD, however, in September 2009 eight episodes from across series 2 and 3 (along with four episodes from the already released series 1) were made available for download from iTunes, though these are no longer available. Another reason for the lack of DVD releases of the later series is thought to be the 'teenage jihadi' sketches being considered unsuitable in the wake of the 7 July 2005 London bombings that occurred a few months later. == Reception == In 2003, The Observer listed Harry Thompson as one of the 50 funniest or most influential people in British comedy, citing Monkey Dust as evidence and calling it: \\"the most subversive show on television. The topical animated series is dark and unafraid to tackle taboo subjects such as paedophilia, taking us to Cruel Britannia, a creepy place where the public are hoodwinked by arrogant politicians and celebrities. This edgy show doesn't always work, but when it does there is nothing quite like it\\".

It is used in at least two applications: * Luminescence dating of ancient materials: mainly geological sediments and sometimes fired pottery, bricks etc., although in the latter case thermoluminescence dating is used more often * Radiation dosimetry, which is the measurement of accumulated radiation dose in the tissues of health care, nuclear, research and other workers, as well as in building materials in regions of nuclear disaster The method makes use of electrons trapped between the valence and conduction bands in the crystalline structure of certain minerals (most commonly quartz and feldspar). The trapping sites are imperfections of the lattice — impurities or defects. The ionizing radiation produces electron-hole pairs: Electrons are in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The electrons that have been excited to the conduction band may become entrapped in the electron or hole traps. Under the stimulation of light, the electrons may free themselves from the trap and get into the conduction band. From the conduction band, they may recombine with holes trapped in hole traps. If the centre with the hole is a luminescence center (radiative recombination centre), emission of light will occur. The photons are detected using a photomultiplier tube. The signal from the tube is then used to calculate the dose that the material had absorbed. The OSL dosimeter provides a new degree of sensitivity by giving an accurate reading as low as 1 mrem for x-ray and gamma ray photons with energies ranging from 5 keV to greater than 40 MeV. The OSL dosimeter's maximum equivalent dose measurement for x-ray and gamma ray photons is 1000 rem. For beta particles with energies from 150 keV to in excess of 10 MeV, dose measurement ranges from 10 mrem to 1000 rem. Neutron radiation with energies of 40 keV to greater than 35 MeV has a dose measurement range from 20 mrem to 25 rem. In diagnostic imaging, the increased sensitivity of the OSL dosimeter makes it ideal for monitoring employees working in low-radiation environments and for pregnant workers. To carry out OSL dating, mineral grains have to be extracted from the sample. Most commonly these are so-called coarse grains of 100-200 μm or fine grains of 4-11 μm. Occasionally other grain sizes are used. The difference between radiocarbon dating and OSL is that the former is used to date organic materials, while the latter is used to date minerals. Events that can be dated using OSL are, for example, the mineral's last exposure to sunlight; Mungo Man, Australia's oldest human find, was dated in this manner. It is also used for dating the deposition of geological sediments after they have been transported by air (aeolian sediments) or rivers (fluvial sediments). In archaeology, OSL dating is applied to ceramics: The dated event is the time of their last heating to a high temperature (in excess of 400 °C). Recent OSL dating of stone tools in Arabia pushed the \\"out-of-Africa\\" date hypothesis of human migration back 50,000 years and added a possible path of migration from the African continent to the Arabian peninsula instead of through Europe. The most popular OSL method is called single-aliquot regeneration (SAR). ==References== Category:Particle detectors Category:Dating methodologies in archaeology ","title":"Optically stimulated luminescence"},{"id":"515409","text":"The British Virgin Islands Companies Registry. The term \\"offshore company\\" or \\"offshore corporation\\" is used in at least two distinct and different ways. An offshore company may be a reference to: * a company, group or sometimes a division thereof, which engages in offshoring business processes. * International business companies (IBC) or other types of legal entities, which are incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction, that prohibits local economic activities.T.J. van Koningsveld, 2016. De Offshore Wereld Ontmaskerd. Kerckebosch. The former use (companies formed in offshore jurisdictions) is probably the more common usage of the term. In isolated instances the term can also be used in reference to companies with offshore oil and gas operations. ==Companies from offshore jurisdictions== In relation to companies and similar entities which are incorporated in offshore jurisdictions, the use of both the words \\"offshore\\" and \\"company\\" can be varied in application. The extent to which a jurisdiction is regarded as offshore is often a question of perception and degree. Classic tax haven countries such as Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are quintessentially offshore jurisdictions, and companies incorporated in those jurisdictions are invariably labelled as offshore companies. Thereafter there are certain small intermediate countries or areas such as Hong Kong and Singapore (sometimes referred to as \\"mid-shore\\" jurisdictions) which, whilst having oversized financial centres, are not zero tax regimes. Finally, there are classes of industrialised economies which can be used as part of tax mitigation structures, including countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and particularly the United Kingdom, in commentary relating to corporate inversion and the use of British Overseas Territories for this purpose. Furthermore, in Federal systems, states which operate like a classic offshore centre can result in corporations formed there being labelled as offshore, even if they form part of the largest economy in the world (for example, Delaware in the United States). Similarly, the term \\"company\\" is used loosely, and at its widest can be taken to refer to any type of artificial entity, including not just corporations and companies, but potentially also LLCs, LPs, LLPs, and sometimes partnerships or even offshore trusts. ===Classifying offshore companies=== Historically, offshore companies were broadly divided into two categories. On the one hand were companies which were statutorily exempt from taxation in their jurisdiction of registration provided that they did not undertake business with persons resident in that jurisdiction. Such companies were usually called International Business Companies, or IBCs. Such companies were largely popularized by the British Virgin Islands, but the model was copied widely. However, in the early 2000s the OECD launched a global initiative to prevent \\"ring fencing\\" of taxation in this manner, and many leading jurisdictions (including the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar) repealed their International Business Companies legislation. But IBCs are still incorporated in a number of jurisdictions today including Anguilla and Panama. Separately from IBCs, there are countries which operate tax regimes which broadly achieve the same effect: so long as the company's activities are carried on overseas, and none of the profits are repatriated, the company is not subject to taxation in its home jurisdiction. Where the home jurisdiction is regarded as an offshore jurisdiction, such companies are commonly regarded as offshore companies. Examples of this include Hong Kong and Uruguay. However, these tax regimes are not limited to conventional offshore jurisdictions: the United Kingdom operates on broadly similar principles in relation to taxation of companies. Separately there are offshore jurisdictions which simply do not impose any form of taxation on companies, and so their companies are de facto tax exempt. Historically the best example of these countries were the Cayman Islands and Bermuda,Bermuda does, however, impose payroll tax on employees who actually work in Bermuda. although other countries such as the British Virgin Islands have now moved to this model. These could arguably fit into either of the previous two categories, depending on the fiscal point of view involved. To the Offshore Company definition, applies five (non-cumulative) limiting conditions: (1) The government in the country of incorporation does not levy an indirect tax on the OAC (however, the OSC must pay an annual fee to the government). (2) Separate laws and regulations apply. (3) The OSC doesn't have its own physical office (address), personnel, means of communication etc. This means that the OAC must have a representative (registered agent) and office address (registered office) in the county of the incorporation. (4) The OSC must be managed and governed by (an employee of) a local trust or law office. (5) There is an instance of elements that benefit anonymity such as bearer shares and no or limited filing obligations.T.J van Koningsveld, 2016. De Offshore Wereld Ontmaskerd. Kerckebosch. ===Characteristics of offshore companies=== Chart of an offshore company structure Although all offshore companies differ to a degree depending upon the corporate law in the relevant jurisdiction, all offshore companies tend to enjoy certain core characteristics: * They are broadly not subject to taxation in their home jurisdiction. * The corporate regime will be designed to promote business flexibility. * Regulation of corporate activities will normally be lighter than in a developed country.Classic offshore jurisdictions are very fond of the phrase \\"light touch\\" regulation, although in practice many offshore centres are witnessing increasingly invasive regulation. This is probably reflective of the global trend towards greater regulation of the financial system rather than a change within the offshore financial world in particular. The absence of taxation or regulation in the home jurisdiction does not exempt the relevant company from taxation or regulation abroad. For example, Michael Kors Holdings Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is subject both the U.S. taxation and to financial regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Another common characteristic of offshore companies is the limited amount of information available to the public. This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At one end of the scale, in the Cayman Islands and Delaware, there is virtually no publicly available information. But at the other end of the scale, in Hong Kong companies file annual returns with particulars of directors, shareholders and annual accounts. However, even in jurisdictions where there is relatively little information available to the public as of right, most jurisdictions have laws which permit law enforcement authorities (either locally or from overseas) to have access to relevant information,See for example, in the British Virgin Islands, the Mutual Legal Assistance (United States of America) Act, 1990. and in some cases, private individuals.See for example Anton Piller orders, which are available in most common law offshore jurisdictions. In relation to flexible corporate law, most offshore jurisdictions will normally remove corporate fetters such as thin capitalisation rules, financial assistance rules, and limitations on corporate capacity and corporate benefit. A number have also removed or watered down rules relating to maintenance of capital or restrictions on payment of dividends. Beyond the common themes, a number of jurisdictions have also enacted special corporate provisions to try to attract business through offering corporate mechanisms that allow complex business transactions or reorganisations to occur more smoothly.See for example: British Virgin Islands company law - Reorganisation and restructuring. ===Uses of offshore companies=== Offshore companies are used for a variety of commercial and private purposes, some legitimate and economically beneficial, whilst others may be harmful or even criminal. Allegations are frequently made in the press about offshore companies being used for money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, and other forms of white collar crime. Offshore companies are also used in a wide variety of commercial transactions from generic holding companies, to joint ventures and listing vehicles. Offshore companies are also used widely in connection with private wealth for tax mitigation and privacy. The use of offshore companies, particularly in tax planning, has become controversial in recent years, and a number of high-profile companies have ceased using offshore entities in their group structure as a result of public campaigns for such companies to pay their \\"fair share\\" of Government taxes. Detailed information in relation to the use of offshore companies is notoriously difficult to come by because of the opaque nature of much of the business (and because, in many cases, the companies are used specifically to preserve the confidentiality of a transaction or individual). It is a commonly held view that most uses of offshore companies are driven by tax mitigation and/or regulatory arbitrage, although there are some suggestions that the amount of tax structuring may be less than commonly thought.In Offshore 2020, a publication of market research published by Offshore Incorporations Limited, a leading offshore fiduciary services provider, recent surveys of industry practitioners suggest that the proportion of their work which is tax driven structuring is decreasing: from 15.9% in 2012 () to 10.3% in 2013 (). These figures need to be treated with caution as these are marketing reports, not systematic analyses. Other commonly cited legitimate uses of offshore companies include uses as joint ventures,For example, the Anglo-Russian oil joint venture, TNK-BP, was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a neutral third jurisdiction. financing SPVs, stock market listing vehicles, holding companies and asset holding structures, and trading vehicles. Intermediate uses of offshore companies (i.e. uses which might be considered legitimate or illegitimate depending upon a particular person's view of legitimacy of globalisation and tax planning) include uses as investment funds and private wealth holding vehicles. ==See also== *Corporate inversion *Global sourcing *Low-cost country sourcing *Offshore Financial Centres *Offshore bank *Offshore outsourcing *Offshore software R&D; *Offshoring *Tax avoidance and tax evasion *Tax haven *Conduit and Sink OFCs == References == == External links == * Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, OECD Category:Offshoring Category:International taxation Category:Offshore finance Category:Legal entities Category:Types of business entity ","title":"Offshore company"},{"id":"515410","text":"The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is one of two separate dog breeds known as Welsh Corgis that originated in Wales; the other is the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. It is one of the oldest breeds of the British Isles. Cardigan Welsh Corgis are known to be an extremely loyal dog breed. They are also versatile and can live in a variety of settings. They benefit from regular physical and mental stimulation. ==History== Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh Corgis were originally listed as one breed by The Kennel Club in Britain in 1925, but were declared separate breeds in 1935. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were lumped together under the heading Welsh Corgis. In 1934, the two breeds were recognized individually and shown separately. ===Origins=== blue merle-colored Cardigan One theory is that both breeds of the corgis descended from a line of northern spitz-type dogs. Another is that they descended from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced Dachshunds. ===Name=== The word \\"corgi\\" is derived from the , which means \\"dwarf dog\\". The breed was formerly called \\"yard-long dog\\" (). Today's name comes from their area of origin: Cardigan (Welsh 'Ceredigion'). ===Modern breed=== Originally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship. ==Description== The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox brush tail. The old American Kennel Club standard called it an \\"Alsatian on short legs\\". The Cardigan's tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, whose tail may be long,Hytönen et al. (2008), \\"Ancestral T-box mutation is present in many, but not all, short-tailed dog breeds\\", Journal of Heredity, Advance Access published online on October 14, 2008, naturally bobbed or docked). Cardigans, which are double coated, come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the \\"Irish pattern.\\" Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color.). An average Cardigan is around tall at the withers and weighs from for the male and for the female. Life expectancy is 12–16 years. Litter size can vary; usually four to six puppies. ===Health=== The most common causes of death for the breed were cancer (28.3%), old age (24.6%), and neurological disorders (15.2%). Canine Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) is known to occur in the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. This is likely due to the Cardigan being a dwarf (chondrodysplastic) breed, and these breeds frequently suffer from Type I disk disease. This disease is commonly found in the Dachshund breed. ==Temperament== * Originally bred for farm work, including herding sheep and cattle. Cardigan Welsh Corgis were bred long and low to make sure that any kicks by cattle would travel safely over the dogs' heads without touching them. * Cardigans are highly intelligent, active, athletic dogs. * Housepet They have proven themselves as excellent companion animals, Cardigans are affectionate, devoted companions that can also be alert and responsible guardians. If socialized at a young age, they can be nice with other dogs and housepets. * Competitive in sheepdog trials, dog agility, competitive obedience and rally obedience. * Guard Dogs They are great watch dogs, but if it's a guard dog it will do not as well as the better choices. ==Use as working dogs== Cardigan Welsh Corgis compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball and tracking events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

It is located in the western part of the country within the Trnava Region and is the seat of its own district. It is the biggest and best known spa town in Slovakia and has around 28,000 inhabitants. ==Etymology== The name Piešťany comes from Slovak Piesok (sand), referring to local sandbanks. The etymology is straightforward – Piešťanci – people who live on the sandy site and Piešťany – their settlement. ==History== Venus of Moravany The first human settlement in the area is dated to the prehistoric times, about 80,000 years ago. People were attracted to the site by abundance of game in the vicinity of the thermal springs that did not freeze in winter. A small female statue called Venus of Moravany was found in the nearby village Moravany nad Váhom. It is made of mammoth ivory and is dated to 22,800 BC. It currently resides in the Bratislava Castle museum. In another nearby village, Krakovany-Stráže, a treasure consisting of luxury items made of glass, bronze, silver, and gold was discovered in three graves from 200–300 AD. The surroundings of Piešťany also include the Great Moravian castle of Ducové. Piešťany was first mentioned in written records in 1113 (under the name Pescan). At that time it consisted of several smaller settlements. The medicinal springs were already popular in the Middle Ages. They were visited by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. The first book mentioning the Piešťany springs was De admirandis Hungariae aquis hypomnemation (About the Miraculous Waters of the Hungarian Monarchy) by Georgius Wernher, published in 1549 in Basel. In the 16th century, the Piešťany spa was also mentioned by two prominent physicians, Johann Crato de Crafheim (who served to several Holy Roman Emperors) and Andrea Baccius Elpidianus (a personal surgeon of the Pope). The first monography (Schediasma de Thermis Postheinsibus by Ján Justus Torkoš was published in 1745. But in the 16th and 17th centuries, Piešťany also suffered from Turkish raids and anti-Habsburg uprisings. Throughout the centuries Piešťany was owned by several noble families; the last of them, the Erdődys, owned the area from 1720 to 1848, and the spa until 1940. The Erdődy family built the first spa buildings in 1778. They were damaged by a destructive flood in 1813. In 1820 the spa buildings were expanded and remodeled in neo-classical style and named Napoleon spa. The Erdődy family also established the Spa park in this period. In the years 1889 to 1940 the Winter family rented the spa from the Erdődys and brought it to international fame. The Winters improved spa treatment as well as accommodation and entertainment for visitors. They built several spa buildings and hotels. The spa attracted many aristocratic visitors, including Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1917, three monarchs (Wilhelm II of Germany, Karl I of Austria-Hungary, and Ferdinand I of Bulgaria) orchestrated their war strategy during the negotiations in the Thermia Palace hotel. In 1945 Piešťany received the official status of a town. In 1959, Sĺňava water reservoir was built south of the town. In the late 1960s and 1970s more spa buildings were built. In 1973 the village of Banka, located on the left bank of the Váh river, was amalgamated with Piešťany, but it regained independence after a referendum in 1995. In 1996 the town became the seat of a district. The 1938 World Fencing Championships were held in Piešťany. On January 4, 1987, at the final match in the World Junior Championships of ice hockey between Canada and the Soviet Union there was a bench-clearing brawl, now famously known as the Punch-up in Piešťany. Both teams were disqualified from competition as a result. On July 5, 2001 three members of the Real Irish Republican Army were arrested in Piešťany. They were lured into a trap by agents of the British Security Service MI5 who were posing as arms dealers from Iraq. The Váh river in Piešťany ==Geography== Piešťany is situated in the western part of Slovakia, in the valley of the Váh river, at an elevation of . The Považský Inovec mountains form the eastern boundary of this part of the Váh valley. The highest hill of these mountains, Inovec , is about north of the town. The hills immediately east of the town ( away) reach a height of about . On the western side, the valley boundary is formed by the Little Carpathians, which are somewhat lower and further away from the town. The valley is open to the south, and thus has a warm and sunny temperate climate. Most of the town is located on the right bank of the river. South of the town is the Sĺňava water reservoir created by a dam on the Váh river. The artificial canal Biskupický kanál and the main river branch join in the town. Another short branch of the river (Obtokové rameno) creates the Spa Island. The hills of Považský Inovec are mostly covered with deciduous forests. These consist of oak and hornbeam in the lower elevations, and beech in the higher elevations. The Váh valley is used for agriculture. The main products are cereals, sugar beet, animal feed, and pork. Piešťany is located north-east of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, and north-east of the local regional seat Trnava. Upstream from Piešťany on the Váh river are the towns Nové Mesto nad Váhom ( north of Piešťany) and Trenčín ( north-east); downstream is Hlohovec. Piešťany is located on the route of the D1 motorway from Bratislava to Žilina with connections to Vienna and Brno. The main railway route from Bratislava to Žilina and Košice also goes through the town. The town has an airport, mostly used for international charter flights for spa clients (10,000 passengers in 2007). The municipality operates a local public transport system with 11 bus routes (). ==Main sights== Because of frequent floods in the past, most buildings are dated to the 19th and 20th century. The most notable exception are the ruins of a medieval monastery from the 13th century. The Napoleon Spa is a complex of Neoclassicist spa buildings built between 1822 and 1862. The town’s Catholic church dates from the same era. The Kolonádový most bridge, constructed by Emil Belluš in 1930–33, is a preeminent functionalist construction with many precious art objects. ===Spa=== The Napoleonic Spa The Piešťany spa has a capacity of two thousand beds () and treats over forty thousand patients a year. More than 60% of the clients are foreigners (mostly from Germany, the Czech Republic, Israel, Austria and Arab Countries). The spa specializes in treatment of chronic rheumatic and arthritic diseases and post- accident lesions of joints and bones. The spa is located on the Spa Island between two branches of the Váh river, at the site of several hot springs with temperatures of . The water originates in a tectonic break at depth. The sulfate–carbonate water from the springs is used in pools and tubs. Sulfurous mud extracted from the bed of a side channel of the river is also used for treatment in the form of thermal mud pools with temperature and for partial and full body packs. Spring water and mud therapy is complemented by electrotherapy, exercise, massage, medication, and diet. The spa is operated by the company Slovenské liečebné kúpele. The company was purchased in 2002 by Danubius Hotels Group. A small share is owned by the town. Danubius Hotels Group also owns hotels in Hungary, Mariánské Lázně spa in Czech Republic and Sovata spa in Romania. ==Demographics== According to the 2001 census, the town had 30,306 inhabitants. 96.30% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.69% Czechs and 0.27% Hungarians. The religious makeup was 72.65% Roman Catholics, 16.71% people with no religious affiliation and 5.96% Lutherans. ==Economy== The 8-bit PMD 85 personal computer produced in 1985–1990 by the Czechoslovak Tesla company in Piešťany One of important employers in the city during the communist era was the Czechoslovak electronics maker Tesla Piešťany. It closed down in 1991 and in 1998 its factories were acquired by ON Semiconductor, a former subsidiary of Motorola . However, the company closed down its Pieštany manufacturing unit in 2010 and moved production to Belgium , keeping a small customer support centre in the town. Delipro, s.r.o., manufacturer of quartz crystals founded in 1993, is another company building on the legacy of electronics manufacturing in the region . Other important employers in the town include Slovak headquarters of financial services company Home Credit Slovakia , and cosmetics distributor Nachema Group . Technický skúšobný ústav Piešťany, š.p. is an independent certification, testing and inspection body for conformity assessment of machinery and construction products and consumer goods. Historically, Technický skúšobný ústav Piešťany is one of the oldest and the largest testing bodies in Slovak Republic within testing activity. ==Culture== A World War I biplane of Milan Rastislav Štefánik in the military museum The town is known in Slovakia for its rich cultural programme throughout the year. In the summer tourist season, the town hosts several cultural events. Both opening (in June) and closing (in September) of the summer spa season is connected with big street festivals. An annual summer classical music festival, Piešťany Music Festival, established in 1955, takes place in the House of Arts of Piešťany. This venue, with a seating capacity of 622, is currently the largest cinema hall in Slovakia and also offers other concerts and theatre shows. Country Lodenica is a festival of folk and country music established in 1999. It takes place south of the town, on the shores of Sĺňava water reservoir. Since 2000s, various festivals were held at Piešťany Airport, among others second largest music festival in Slovakia - GrapeFestival, rock-centered Topfest, electronic music-focused BeeFree or Hodokvas. Furthermore, from 2006 to 2009 and since 2019 there have been air shows.Grape Festival PiešťanyTHE ORGANIZERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIR FEST DAYS MLD SIAF ESTABLISH THE NEW TRADITION OF THE FESTIVAL OF AVIATION In: Festival letectva, 5 April 2019 There were also regular car-, motorcycle- and truck- races. Between 1967 and 1993 the city was the site of an annual sculpture exhibition in the Spa Park . This tradition was renewed in 2005 and 2008. Piešťany also has several museums. The Balneological Museum of Imrich Winter , the only one of its type in the region, focuses on archeology, history and ethnography of the region, as well as the history of Slovakia's spas in general. It was established in 1933 by the Winter family. Another small museum belonging to Balneological Museum commemorates the life of the Slovak poet Ivan Krasko, who lived in Piešťany from 1945 to 1958. Finally, a new museum at the airport (active since 2004) exhibits a collection related to the Slovak military history from 1945 to 1992. The House of Arts is the first postwar Slovak theatre building outside Bratislava, being project of architect Ferdinand Milučký. In first half of September, the annual International Film Festival Cinematik is held in various areas of Piešťany. It is currently the second largest film festival in Slovakia.Cinematik ==Notable people== * An art colony established by several Slovak artists, including Janko Alexy, Martin Benka, Miloš Alexander Bazovský, and Zoltán Palugyay, existed in Piešťany in 1932–1937 * Ivan Krasko, Slovak poet lived in Piešťany in 1945–1958 (his former apartment houses a small museum) * Charles Korvin Hungarian-American actor, born Kárpáthy * Ivan Stodola, writer, playwright, and physician lived in Piešťany in 1953–1977 * Irena Belohorská, politician, former member of European Parliament, born in Piešťany in 1948 * Emire Khidayer, diplomat, entrepreneur and writer was born in Piešťany in 1971 * Ľudmila Cervanová, professional tennis player was born in Piešťany in 1979 * Slavic Patriota, remixer and DJ lives in Piešťany but was born in Serbia 2005 * Róbert Erban, world champion in the kayak K4 was born in Piešťany in 1972 * Slavomír Kňazovický, flatwater canoer was born in Piešťany in 1969 * Martina Moravcová, swimmer with 2 silver Olympic medals was born in Piešťany in 1976 and grew up in the town * Branko Radivojevič, ice hockey player was born in Piešťany in 1980 * Michel Miklík, ice hockey player was born in Piešťany in 1982 * Shmuel Dovid Ungar, Rabbi, Rosh yeshiva of the Nitra Yeshiva, born in Piešťany in 1886 * Victor Vasarely, Hungarian artist, father of op-art, grew up in Piešťany * Dominika Cibulková, professional tennis player, born in 1989, grew up in Piešťany * Filip Hološko, professional footballer * Ján Šlahor, professional footballer, born in Piešťany in 1977 * Ernö Rubik, Hungarian aircraft designer * Magdaléna Rybáriková, tennis player, born in Piešťany in 1988 * Lukáš Lacko, tennis player * Filip Horanský, tennis player, born in Piešťany in 1993 * Yissachar Shlomo Teichtal, the Chief Rabbi of Slovakia worked in Piešťany in 1920–1942 ==Twin towns — sister cities== Piešťany is twinned with: * Újbuda (Budapest), Hungary * Eilat, Israel * Hajdúnánás, Hungary * Heinola, Finland * Luhačovice, Czech Republic * Poděbrady, Czech Republic * Ustroń, Poland * Varaždinske Toplice, Croatia ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Vladimír Krupa (2001) \\"Kúpele Piešťany\\".

It was built in honour of William Tyndale, a translator of the New Testament, who was born nearby. It is a Grade II* listed building. The tower was constructed in 1866 and is 111 ft (34 m) tall. It is possible to enter and climb to the top of the tower, up a spiral staircase of 121 steps. The hill it is on allows a wide range of views, especially looking down to the River Severn. A nearby topograph points to some other landmarks visible. The hill on which the monument stands is quite steep. The path follows a rough fairly steep bridleway which is part of the Cotswold Way. The tower itself is surrounded by fencing and has floodlights that light up the tower at night. The stairway has automatic lighting. The Cotswold Way long- distance footpath passes the foot of the monument, and then descends the hill into North Nibley. The door to the tower is always open. Locally, it is commonly called Nibley Monument rather than its official name. The hill is called Nibley Knoll or occasionally Nibley Knob. There is a commemorative plaque on the front of the tower. The text engraved on it reads: William Tyndale. :ERECTED A.D. 1866 :IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF :WILLIAM TYNDALE :TRANSLATOR OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE :WHO FIRST CAUSED THE NEW TESTAMENT :TO BE PRINTED IN THE MOTHER TONGUE :OF HIS COUNTRYMEN :BORN NEAR THIS SPOT HE SUFFERED :MARTYRDOM AT VILVORDEN IN :FLANDERS ON OCT 6 1536 The monument is a landmark that can be seen for miles, even in places as far as Bristol over 20 miles away. In the town of Thornbury there is a street called Tyndale View where the tower can be seen from approximately 10 miles away. Further down the Cotswold Edge, at Hawkesbury, is the Somerset Monument, erected in 1846, and the design of the Tyndale tower has features in common with this. In October 2019 protesters from Extinction Rebellion used the monument to display a protest banner. ==References== ==External links== *Illustrated London News, November 17th 1866 - Monument opening announcement Category:Monuments and memorials in Gloucestershire Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1866 Category:Towers in Gloucestershire Category:1866 establishments in England ","title":"Tyndale Monument"},{"id":"515426","text":"Mount Cameroon is an active volcano in the South West region of Cameroon next to the city of Buea near the Gulf of Guinea. Mount Cameroon is also known as Cameroon Mountain or Fako (the name of the higher of its two peaks) or by its indigenous name Mongo ma Ndemi (\\"Mountain of Greatness\\"). It is the highest point in sub-Saharan western and central Africa,\\"Mount Cameroon\\", Encyclopedia Britannica the fourth-most prominent peak in Africa, and the 31st-most prominent in the world. The mountain is part of the area of volcanic activity known as the Cameroon Volcanic Line, which also includes Lake Nyos, the site of a disaster in 1986. The most recent eruption occurred on February 3, 2012. == Description == alt= Mount Cameroon is one of Africa's largest volcanoes, rising to above the coast of west Cameroon. It rises from the coast through tropical rainforest to a bare summit, which is cold, windy, and occasionally dusted with snow. The massive steep-sided volcano of dominantly basaltic-to- trachybasaltic composition forms a volcanic horst constructed above a basement of Precambrian metamorphic rocks covered with Cretaceous to Quaternary sediments. More than 100 small cinder cones, often fissure-controlled parallel to the long axis of the massive volcano, occur on the flanks and surrounding lowlands. A large satellitic peak, Etinde (also known as Little Mount Cameroon), is located on the southern flank near the coast. View of Mount Etinde Peak Mount Cameroon has the most frequent eruptions of any West African volcano. The first written account of volcanic activity could be the one from the Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator, who may have observed the mountain in the 5th century BC. Moderate explosive and effusive eruptions have occurred throughout history from both summit and flank vents. A 1922 eruption on the southwestern flank produced a lava flow that reached the Atlantic coast. A lava flow from a 1999 south-flank eruption stopped 200 m (660 ft) from the sea, cutting the coastal highway.

The lowland forests are part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion. They are composed of evergreen trees with a dense canopy 25 to 30 meters high, with taller emergent trees rising above the canopy. Many trees have buttress roots. The forests are diverse and species- rich, with numerous lianas. Much of the lowland forest has been converted to agriculture and agroforestry, including oil palm plantations. * Lower montane forest, also known as submontane forest or cloud forest, grows between 800 and 1,600 meters elevation. The lower montane forests are composed of evergreen trees, which form a 20 – 25 meter-high canopy that is either closed or discontinuous. There are scattered areas of meadow and scrubland, with grasses, herbs, tall herbaceous plants (including Acanthaceae), tree ferns, woody shrubs, and low trees. Frequent clouds and mists sustain profuse epiphytes, including mosses, ferns, and orchids. The lower montane forests are diverse and species-rich, with characteristic Afromontane plants and endemic species. Impatiens etindensisCheek, M. and S. Cable. 2000. Impatiens etindensis.

The lower montane forests, together with the higher-elevation forests, scrub, and grasslands, are part of the Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests ecoregion. * Upper montane forest grows from 1,600 – 1,800 meters elevation. Trees up to 20 meters high form an open-canopied forest with numerous epiphytes. The upper montane forests are less species-rich than the lower-elevation forests, and fires are more frequent. * Montane scrub grows between 1,800 and 2,400 meters elevation. Low trees of 1 to 15 meters form open-canopied forests, woodlands, and shrublands, with an understory of small shrubs, herbs, ferns, and climbers. * Montane grassland occurs between 2,000 and 3,000 meters elevation. The dominant vegetation is tussock grasses, with scattered fire-tolerant shrubs and low trees. * Sub-alpine grassland is found at the highest elevations, from 3,000 to over 4,000 meters. Frost-tolerant tussock grasses, dwarf trees and shrubs, and crustose, foliose, and fruticose lichens predominate. ==Fauna== Large mammals on the mountain include the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), with a population of over 100 individuals. Other herbivores include red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), and yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor). The mountain is home to several species of primates, including chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus), red-capped mangabey (Cercocebos torquatus), putty- nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans), mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona), red- eared monkey (Cercopithecus erythrotis), Preuss’ guenon (Cercopithecus preussii), and crowned guenon (Cercopithecus pogonias). Two species of birds are endemic to Mount Cameroon, Mount Cameroon spurfowl (Pternistis camerunensis) and Mount Cameroon speirops (Zosterops melanocephalus). ==Mount Cameroon National Park== alt= Mount Cameroon National Park (Parc National du Mont Cameroun) was created in 2009.

The son of a Welsh clergyman, he was for much of his life in the shadow of his elder brother Thomas Howell, who became Lord Bishop of Bristol. ==Education== In 1613 he gained his B.A. from Jesus College, Oxford - he was to be elected to a fellowship at Jesus College in 1623, but he was never formally admitted and his place was taken by another in 1626. Until he was 13, he was schooled in Hereford. He went to Oxford at the age of 19. ==Career== After graduation, he had a variety of employments, as an administrator for a glass manufacturer, and in the often combined roles of secretary and instructor to several noble families. As factory agent and negotiator he traveled widely in Europe and learned to speak several languages, apparently with great facility. He also met and befriended numerous literary figures, among them Ben Jonson and Kenelm Digby. Paramount amongst his priorities was however royal, or at least aristocratic patronage. On the eve of the English Civil War, he finally gained a secretaryship of the Privy Council, which according to one eminent critic, was \\"very close to the type of appointment that he had sought for 20 years\\". The conflict meant that he never took up the position, and at about the same time, he wrote his first book, or \\"maiden Fancy\\", Dodona's Grove, which represented the history of England and Europe through the allegorical framework of a typology of trees. It is worth noting that he started to publish at this time of ferment although he was already well established as a writer of what we would know today as 'newsletters' but were then known as 'tracts' or 'pamphlets'. He was the first writer to earn his living solely from writing in the English language. He was also the first writer of an epistolary novel, a novel of letters, in English (\\"Familiar Letters\\"). His \\"Lexicon Tetragloton\\" was not a dictionary in four languages, as its name would suggest, but in six; a dictionary of Latin vernacular (Romance language) proverbs. It is a highly respected work in the Portuguese and Spanish languages as well, quite apart from his native Welsh. He was a prolific writer. His \\"New English Grammar\\" is also considered, by modern historians of formal English, as a work of foreign language teaching and as the first work of its kind in the English language. Engraved titlepage of the 1645 edition of James Howell's Epistolae HoElianae Familiar Letters Domestic & Forren, engraving by William Marshall. He had a family tree parallel to the Herbert family of Swansea, Earl of Pembroke descendant of Nest and Hywel Dda of Wales. Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis) son of Nest, was a historiographer royal five hundred years before and on a journey of conquest to Ireland, the story of which is one of the finest works of literature in the Welsh language. James Howell may also have been closely linked, by family, to Thomas Howell, a 16th-century love poet who was probably his grandfather and who served the first Earl (see above) in a clerical capacity. While he corresponded with a certain Earl of Pembroke in his own Epistolae Ho-Elianae and was great friends with Ben Jonson, his literary 'father', he himself does not make mention of this family tie. His line of descent was from Dafydd Gam. Thomas Howell (born about 1538), who is thought to have hailed from Dunster, Somerset, with roots in Caerfyrddyn, may have been one of the gentry encouraged to learn Latin at the time. Howell's Proverbs (1659), contains probably his most famous quote; All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.http://www.famousquotesandauthors.com/authors/james_howell_quotes.html == Principal literary works== *Howell, James.

The McFlurry has a specially designed spoon with a hole in the handle which is attached to a blender. Various types of candy or cookies are added to the cup, which are then blended using the spoon. McFlurry flavors vary from market to market, and new flavors are introduced regularly. The ice cream in a McFlurry is the same that McDonald's uses for its cones and sundaes. The ice cream is made from UHT milk, extended with methylcellulose. CNBC reported that, beginning in the fall of 2016, McDonald's started phasing out artificial flavors from its vanilla ice cream. The change was part of an effort to recover the more than 500 million customer visits it had lost since 2012. ==Variants== Flavours include Oreo, Creme Egg and Smarties in the UK market. ==Reviews== Despite calling the McFlurry \\"a quick-serve medley of gelatinous, innocuous ice cream that some reviewers might consider closer to caulk than dairy,\\" Wil Fulton of the Thrillist ranked the M&M; McFlurry at the end of his list of the 17 Best Fast Food Desserts.

An insertion device (ID) is a component in modern synchrotron light sources, so called because they are \\"inserted\\" into accelerator tracks. They are periodic magnetic structures that stimulate highly brilliant, forward-directed synchrotron radiation emission by forcing a stored charged particle beam to perform wiggles, or undulations, as they pass through the device. This motion is caused by the Lorentz force, and it is from this oscillatory motion that we get the names for the two classes of device, which are known as wigglers and undulators. As well as creating a brighter light, some insertion devices enable tuning of the light so that different frequencies can be generated for different applications. ==History== The theory behind undulators was developed by Vitaly Ginzburg in the USSR. However it was Motz and his team who in 1953 installed the first undulator in a linac at Stanford, using it to generate millimetre wave radiation through to visible light. It was not until the 1970s that undulators were installed in electron storage rings to produce synchrotron radiation. The first institutions to take these devices were the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow, and the Tomsk Polytechnic University. These installations allowed a fuller characterisation of the behaviour of undulators. Undulators only became practical devices for insertion in synchrotron light sources in 1981, when teams at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), and at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) in Russia developed permanent magnetic arrays, known as Halbach arrays, which allowed short repeating periods unachievable with either electromagnetic coils or superconducting coils. Despite their similar function, wigglers were used in storage rings for over a decade before they were used to generate synchrotron radiation for beamlines. Wigglers have a damping effect on storage rings, which is the function to which they first put at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator in Massachusetts in 1966. The first wiggler used for generation of synchrotron radiation was a 7 pole wiggler installed in the SSRL in 1979. Since these first insertions the number of undulators and wigglers in synchrotron radiation facilities throughout the world have proliferated and they are one of the driving technologies behind the next generation of light sources, free electron lasers. ==Operation== Insertion devices are traditionally inserted into straight sections of storage rings (hence their name). As the stored particle beam, usually electrons, pass through the ID the alternating magnetic field experienced by the particles causes their trajectory to undergo a transverse oscillation. The acceleration associated with this movement stimulates the emission of synchrotron radiation. There is very little mechanical difference between wigglers and undulators and the criterion normally used to distinguish between them is the K-Factor. The K-factor is a dimensionless constant defined as: K=\\\\frac{q B \\\\lambda_u}{2 \\\\pi \\\\beta m c} where q is the charge of the particle passing through the ID, B is the peak magnetic field of the ID, \\\\lambda_u is the period of the ID, \\\\beta=v/c relates to the speed, or energy of the particle, m is the mass of the accelerated particle, and c is the speed of light. Wigglers are deemed to have K>>1 and undulators to have K<1\\\\. The K-Factor determines the energy of radiation produced, and in situations where a range of energy is required the K-number can be modified by varying the strength of the magnetic field of the device. In permanent magnet devices this is usually done by increasing the gap between the magnet arrays. In electromagnetic devices the magnetic field is changed by varying the current in the magnet coils. In a wiggler the period and the strength of the magnetic field is not tuned to the frequency of radiation produced by the electrons. Thus every electron in a bunch radiates independently, and the resulting radiation bandwidth is broad. A wiggler can be considered to be series of bending magnets concatenated together, and its radiation intensity scales as the number of magnetic poles in the wiggler. In an undulator source the radiation produced by the oscillating electrons interferes constructively with the motion of other electrons, causing the radiation spectrum to have a relatively narrow bandwidth. The intensity of radiation scales as N^2, where N is the number of poles in the magnet array. ==References== Category:Synchrotron instrumentation de:Insertion device ","title":"Insertion device"},{"id":"515441","text":"James Howell from Dodona's Grove (1641) by Abraham BosseDodona's Grove (1640) is a historical allegory by James Howell, making extensive use of tree lore. ==Description== This curiosity purports to be a history of Europe since the accession of James I of England put into an allegorical form in which the roles of the various kings, princes and nobles are taken by various trees. Its effect, however, is not quite what that would imply, as the tree-allegory remains on the level of the emblem, whereas the action demands if not people, then anthropomorphs convincingly capable of some sort of agency. Before the book is properly underway there is already a tension between its tenor and supposed vehicle. Having set up an allegorical apparatus, with a comprehensive 'Clavis', or key of the significance of the various names which he uses, as well as illustrations of the various trees, the text itself, though conforming vaguely to an allegorical mode, is anything but smooth in its allegorical workings, anything but subtle in its jarring clashes of style and treatment, which take it far away from earlier, more consistently executed examples of the genre. ==Publication== In England at the time of the publication of Dodona's Grove, the dominant paradigm for the writing of allegorical romance, particularly when of a political nature was John Barclay's Argenis, a work which told the story of the religious conflict in France under Henry III and IV. Both of the dedicatory poems which precede Dodona's Grove mention the volume, and indeed there are similarities between Barclay and Howell in their attitudes towards writing, but what they have to say equally points up their differences. In Barclay, the process is much more subtle, more comprehensively articulated as an allegory which is inclusive of all its aspects. Instead of putting forward any kind of manifesto himself, he lets one of the characters in the romance tell of \\"a new form of writing\\", which he intends to invent, and thus places the text's genesis within its own fictional space: :... I will compile some stately fable in manner of a history: in it will I fold up strange events and mingle together arms, marriages, bloodshed, mirth with many and various successes... And that they may not say, they are traduced, no mans Character shall be simply set down: I shall find many things to conceal them, which would not agree with them if they were made known. I know the disposition of our country-men: because I seem to tell them tales, I shall haunt them all. While they read, while they are affected with anger or flaw, as it were against strangers, they shall meet with themselves; and find in the glass held before them, the shew and merit of their own fame. For, I that bind not myself religiously to the writing of a true History, may take this liberty. ==Historical form== Like Barclay, Howell eschews conventional historical form, but the earlier writer's subtle combination of raison d'etre and moral considerations are quite distinct from Howell's intentions, or rather what he would like us to believe those intentions are. He writes as he does on the authority of the ancients, rather than political expedients he claims: : Nor is the Author the first, though the first in this peculiar Maiden fancy, who deeming it a flat and vulgar task to compile a plain and downright story, which consists merely of collections, and is as easier as walking horses or gleaning of corn hath under heiroglyphicks, allegories and emblems endeavour'd to diversifie and enrich the matter, to embroder it up and down with Apologies, Essays, Parables, and other flourishes; for we find this to be the ancient'st and most ingenious way of delivering truth, and transmitting it to posterity: Omnis fabula fundatur in Historia. ==Context== The book was written and published four years before the creation of the Royal Society, College for the Promoting of Physical-Mathematic Experimental Learning. As a Greco-Latin scholar he was well aware of Temenos. The tree of knowledge, which has been the watch phrase of the academic and scientist, has been replaced, in the last 30 years, by Genomics and genetics. Knowing the kingdoms and phyla, upon the tree, and even Darwinian species, is now more of a child's working tool, than that of a mature scientist. The suggestion that he was interested in Galen's medicine is far from inaccurate, since some of the trees of medical knowledge were known even then. Today they are known as systematics, cladistics, or phylogenetics, each classification being taken from a different node of the tree, and being treated as the top of a new tree. Digital technology now provides an alphabet-numeric system of classification. There are a great many different kinds of class in modern plant and animal taxonomy, from super- domain to sub-cross. Dodona's Grove was a serious commitment, a dedication, to the new learning which the Royal Society was set up to investigate. Law also has its own taxonomy, its own tree, which was considered by lawyers, such as Howell, to be a living entity. It still is. Kingdoms that he mentioned referred to the kingdoms of learning; as above kingdom.... phyla...class.... order... family...genus... species. (A mnemonic: KPCOFGS) Of similar date to Hartlib as he was, (His work has been compared to modern internet search engines) he may well have espoused pansophism. Hartlib was in favor of Cromwell whilst Howell was a courtier, against the country party. Nor did he exclude the Kingdoms, the family tree of languages, which he understood so well, the ethnology of language. It is a work by a man of profound learning, attempting to encapsulate the ambitions of the newly forming Royal Society. He was not a founding father of the Society but then he was not a scientist in the evolving sense of the word. The book is arguably not an allegory at all, and it is understandable, before the days of Cladistic kingdoms, that the proliferation of words, such as tribe, clan, ancestry, family, kingdom, used even now, should lead him to consider kings and queens as such. There are now other, better ways of memorizing facts than by using terms of an anthropological hierarchy. ==Styles== Epistemologically, therefore, what Howell will admit as truth is a broad spectrum of styles, and their heterogeneous nature, rather than undermining his viewpoint, confirms it in that the various styles that he uses do indeed clash with one another, demonstrating themselves as corollaries of the elemental conflicts in the extra-textual world, and upon which, as a neo-Stoic, he believed that world was based. This shall be discussed further below. On a first reading, these clashing registers of discourse are particularly noticeable; set uncomfortably with the parergon of the allegory, the text's main framework, sit a variety of discourses: an exposition of the various lands of Europe strides the topoi and genres of travel narrative in the first section, whilst later, diplomatic history and the romance ideal chafe against one another when Prince Charles' visit to Spain is dealt with. ==Main subject== The book's purported main subject, that of history, is often drowned out in the surface noise of the competing discourses in which it is expressed. The pulling of the text between narrative strategies, and between systems of mythology, medicine and philosophy can be arresting, and sometimes annoying, but these are disjunctions which are meant to be there, and the clashes and shifts in register which we see in this work are most probably intentional. Whether this makes good or bad historiography is another matter. In this case, the results are not important in terms of success or failure, but in terms of their invention. ==Rhetorical structure== The rhetorical form of Dodona's Grove is based on a series of frames, and a series of concomitant modes. Within its allegorical world of trees, the book has two main frames: that of the syncretic Stuart myth, which fuses elements of Greek, Roman and ancient British myth with hermetic neoplatonism, and that of a specific view of Galenic medicine, altered by an interest in neo-Stoical philosophy to be a radically unstable phenomenon. In these two clashing frameworks must exist the various modes in which the events are narrated: travel narrative, romance, diplomatic report, encomium, and medical treatise. ==See also== *Pembroke, William Herbert of Swansea *Dodona — The place in Greece, the myth and the Oracle. ==References== ==External links== *From The Abraham Cowley Text and Image Archive *http://www.calvin.edu/academic/clas/pathways/dodona/ninf.htm Category:English books Category:1640 books Category:Allegory ","title":"Dodona's Grove"},{"id":"515445","text":"Maurice Morning Wills (born October 2, 1932) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) primarily for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1959 through 1966 and the latter part of 1969 through 1972 as a shortstop and switch-hitter; he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1967 and 1968, and the Montreal Expos the first part of 1969. Wills was an essential component of the Dodgers' championship teams in the mid-1960s, and is credited for reviving the stolen base as part of baseball strategy. Wills was the National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1962, stealing a record 104 bases to break the old modern era mark of 96, set by Ty Cobb in 1915. He was an All-Star for five seasons and seven All-Star Games, and was the first MLB All-Star Game Most Valuable Player in 1962. He also won Gold Gloves in 1961 and 1962. In a fourteen-year career, Wills batted .281 with 20 home runs, 458 runs batted in, 2,134 hits, 1,067 runs, 177 doubles, 71 triples, 586 stolen bases and 552 bases on balls in 1,942 games. Since , Wills is a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization serving as a representative of the Dodgers Legend Bureau. In 2014, Wills appeared for the first time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015 which required 12 votes. Wills missed getting elected by 3 votes. All the other candidates on the ballot also missed being elected. The Committee meets and votes on ten selected candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. ==Early life== Wills was born in Washington, D.C. Maurice, or Sonny as he was called at Cardozo Senior High School in Washington, first showed up as an All City pitcher in the local Washington Daily News. He played on Sal Hall's undefeated '48 Cardozo football team that never had any points scored against them. In the '49–'50 school year, three-sport standout Sonny Wills was named an All City football quarterback, basketball player, and baseball pitcher. On May 8, 1950, in a game against Phelps, Wills threw a one-hitter and struck out seventeen. ==MLB career== PCL Seattle Rainiers in 1957. ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== Wills began his major league career in 1959 and played in 83 games for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1959 World Series, he played in each of the six games, hitting 5-for-20 with one stolen base and two runs in the Dodger victory. In Wills' first-full season in 1960, he hit .295 and led the league with 50 stolen bases, being the first National League player to steal 50 bases since Max Carey stole 51 in . In , Wills stole 104 bases to set a new MLB stolen base record, breaking the old modern era mark of 96, set by Ty Cobb in 1915. Wills also stole more bases than all of the other teams that year, the highest total being the Washington Senators' 99. Wills success in base stealing that year led to another remarkable statistic, he was caught stealing just 13 times all season. He hit .299 for the season, led the NL with 10 triples and 179 singles, and was selected the NL Most Valuable Player over Willie Mays (Mays hit .304 with 49 home runs and 141 runs batted in) by seven points. Not until Barry Larkin in would another shortstop win a National League Most Valuable Player Award. Late in that record-setting 1962 season, San Francisco Giants Manager Alvin Dark ordered grounds crews to water down the base paths, turning them into mud to hinder Wills' base-stealing attempts. Wills played a full 162 game schedule, plus all three games of the best of three regular season playoff series with the Giants, giving him a total of 165 games played, an MLB record that still stands for most games played in a single season. His 104 steals remained a Major League record for switch-hitters until 1985, when Vince Coleman eclipsed the mark with 110. In the 1963 World Series, he went 2-for-16 for a .133 batting average with one stolen base. In the 1965 World Series, he played in all seven games and went 11-for-30 with three runs and three stolen bases in a hard-fought Dodger victory, his third and last World Series title. Wills with the Dodgers, circa 1960 While playing for the Dodgers, Wills was a Gold Glove Award winner in 1961 and 1962, and was named a NL All-Star five times (5 seasons); selected seven times for the All-Star Game (2 games were played in 1961 and 1962). In the 1966 World Series, he went 1-for-13 with one stolen base on a .077 batting average as the Dodgers were swept in four games. Following the 1966 season, in which he dropped to 38 stolen bases and was caught stealing 24 times, the Dodgers traded Wills to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Bob Bailey and Gene Michael. ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== On December 1, 1966, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Bob Bailey and Gene Michael. In the 1967 season, he played in 149 games while having 186 hits, 29 stolen bases (his lowest since having 35 in 1961) and 45 RBIs for a .302 batting average. In the following season, he played in 153 games, getting 174 hits, 31 RBIs and 52 stolen bases, although he was caught stealing 21 times, with a .278 batting average. ===Montreal Expos=== On October 14, 1968, he was drafted by the Montreal Expos from the Pirates as the 21st pick in the expansion draft. Wills batted first in the lineup for the inaugural game of the Expos on April 8, 1969. He went 3-for-6 with one RBI and one stolen base in the 11-10 win.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN196904080.shtml He would play just 47 games for the team, getting 42 hits and 15 stolen bases on a .222 batting average. On June 11, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Manny Mota to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ron Fairly and Paul Popovich. ===Back to the Dodgers=== In 104 games, he hit safely 129 times while stealing 25 bases for a .297 batting average. He was 11th in MVP voting that year. In the following year, he played in 132 games while having 141 hits and 28 stolen bases on a .270 batting average. For 1971, he played in 149 games while having 169 hits, 15 stolen bases and a .281 batting average, although he finished 6th in MVP voting. 1972 was his final season, and Wills played 71 games for 17 hits and one stolen base and a .129 batting average. In his final appearance on October 4, 1972, he served as a pinch runner for Ron Cey in the top of the ninth inning, scoring a run on a home-run by Steve Yeager while also playing the bottom of the ninth inning at third base.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL197210040.shtml On October 24, 1972, he was released by the Dodgers. ===Base stealing=== Although Chicago White Sox shortstop Luis Aparicio had been stealing 50+ bases in the American League for several years prior to Wills' insurgence, Wills brought new prominence to the tactic. Perhaps this was due to greater media exposure in Los Angeles, or to the Dodgers' greater success, or to their extreme reliance on a low-scoring strategy that emphasized pitching, defense, and Wills' speed to compensate for their lack of productive hitters. Wills was a significant distraction to the pitcher even if he didn't try to steal, because he was a constant threat to do so. The fans at Dodger Stadium would chant, \\"Go! Go! Go, Maury, Go!\\" any time he got on base. While not the fastest runner in the major leagues, Wills accelerated with remarkable speed. He also studied pitchers relentlessly, watching their pick-off moves even when not on base. And when driven back to the bag, his fierce competitiveness made him determined to steal. Once when on first base against New York Mets pitcher Roger Craig, Wills drew twelve consecutive throws from Craig to the Mets first baseman. On Craig's next pitch to the plate, Wills stole second. In the wake of his record-breaking season, Wills' stolen base totals dropped precipitously. Though he continued to frighten pitchers once on base, he stole only 40 bases in 1963 and 53 bases in 1964. In 1965, Wills set out on a pace to break his own record. By the time of the All-Star Game in July, he was 19 games ahead of his 1962 pace. However, Wills at age 32, began to slow in the second half. The punishment of sliding led him to bandage his legs before every game, and he ended the 1965 season with 94 stolen bases which was the second highest in National League history at that time. ==Managing and retirement== After retiring, Wills spent time as a baseball analyst at NBC from 1973 through 1977. He also managed in the Mexican Pacific League—a winter league—for four seasons, during which time he led the Naranjeros de Hermosillo to the 1970–71 season league championship. Wills let it be known he felt qualified to pilot a big-league club. In his book, How To Steal A Pennant, Wills claimed he could take any last-place club and make them champions within four years. The San Francisco Giants allegedly offered him a one-year deal, but Wills turned them down. Finally, in 1980, the Seattle Mariners fired Darrell Johnson and gave Wills the reins. Wills in 1981 Baseball writer Rob Neyer, in his Big Book of Baseball Blunders, criticized Wills for \\"the variety and frequency of [his] mistakes\\" as manager, calling them \\"unparalleled.\\" In a short interview appearing in the June 5, 2006 issue of Newsweek, Neyer said, \\"It wasn't just that Wills couldn't do the in-game stuff. Wills's inability to communicate with his players really sets him apart. He said he was going to make his second baseman, Julio Cruz, his permanent shortstop. Twenty-four hours later he was back at second base. As far as a guy who put in some real time (as a manager), I don't think there's been anyone close to Wills.\\" According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencers Steve Rudman, Wills made a number of gaffes. He called for a relief pitcher although there was nobody warming up in the bullpen, held up another game for 10 minutes while looking for a pinch-hitter and even left a spring-training game in the sixth inning to fly to California. The most celebrated incident of Wills' tenure as manager occurred on April 25, 1981. He ordered the Mariners' grounds crew to make the batter's boxes one foot longer than regulation. The extra foot was in the direction of the mound. However, Oakland Athletics manager Billy Martin noticed something was amiss and asked plate umpire Bill Kunkel to investigate. Under questioning from Kunkel, the Mariners' head groundskeeper admitted Wills had ordered the change. Wills claimed he was trying to help his players stay in the box. However, Martin suspected that given the large number of breaking-ball pitchers on the A's staff, Wills wanted to give his players an advantage. The American League suspended Wills for two games and fined him $500. American League umpiring supervisor Dick Butler likened Wills' actions to setting the bases 88 feet apart instead of 90 feet. After leading Seattle to a 20-38 mark to end the 1980 season, new owner George Argyros fired Wills on May 6, 1981 with the M's deep in last place at 6-18. This gave him a career record of 26-56 for a winning percentage of .317, one of the worst ever for a non-interim manager. Years later, Wills admitted he probably should have gotten some seasoning as a minor-league manager prior to being hired in Seattle. However, the aforementioned Julio Cruz, himself an accomplished base stealer, credited Wills for teaching him how to steal second base against a left-handed pitcher. Dave Roberts, who stole second base and then scored for the Boston Red Sox when facing elimination in Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS, similarly credits Wills for coaching him to steal under pressure circumstances. \\"He said, 'DR, one of these days you're going to have to steal an important base when everyone in the ballpark knows you're gonna steal, but you've got to steal that base and you can't be afraid to steal that base.' So, just kind of trotting out on to the field that night, I was thinking about him. So he was on one side telling me 'this was your opportunity'. And the other side of my brain is saying, 'You're going to get thrown out, don't get thrown out.' Fortunately Maury's voice won out in my head.\\" Roberts' steal set amazing 2004 playoff run in motion https://www.mlb.com/news/dave-roberts- steal-set-amazing-2004-red-sox-playoff-run-in-motion/c-98844328 The Maury Wills Museum is in Fargo, North Dakota at Newman Outdoor Field, home of the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks. Wills was a coach on the team from 1996 to 1997 and currently serves as a radio color commentator for the RedHawks on KNFL \\"740 The Fan\\" with play-by-play announcer Jack Michaels. ==Music career== Throughout most of his major league playing career, Wills supplemented his salary in the off-season by performing extensively as a vocalist and instrumentalist (on banjo, guitar and ukelele), appearing occasionally on television and frequently in night clubs.\\"Entertaining Athletes: Negro Sports Stars Augment Salaries by Performing in Night Clubs\\".

The United States Tax Court supported the Commissioner and the tax case was brought up to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where the decision was subsequently affirmed by it. In 1969, Wills appeared in an episode of the television series Get Smart, entitled \\"Apes of Wrath\\" (season 5, episode 10). In his autobiography, On the Run: The Never Dull and Often Shocking Life of Maury Wills, Wills claimed to have had a love affair with actress Doris Day. Day denied this in her autobiography Doris Day: Her Own Story, where she said it was probably advanced by the Dodgers organization for publicity purposes. Wills was well known as an abuser of alcohol and cocaine until getting sober in 1989. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"In 3 1/2 years, I spent more than $1 million of my own money on cocaine.\\" In December 1983, Wills was arrested for cocaine possession after his former girlfriend, Judy Aldrich, had reported her car had been stolen. During a search of the car, police found a vial allegedly containing .06 grams of cocaine and a water pipe. The charge was dismissed three months later on the grounds of insufficient evidence. The Dodgers organization paid for a drug treatment program, but Wills walked out and continued to use drugs until he began a relationship with Angela George, who encouraged him to begin a vitamin therapy program. The two later married. In his New Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James is highly critical of Wills as a person, but still ranked him as the 19th-best shortstop of all time. Maury Wills is the father of former major leaguer Bump Wills, who played for the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs for six seasons. Due to a salacious anecdote in Wills' autobiography, the two had a falling out, but as of 2004 would occasionally speak. In 2009, Wills was honored by the city of Washington, D.C. and Cardozo Senior High School with the naming of the former Banneker Recreation Field in his honor. The field was completely renovated and serves as Cardozo's home diamond. ==MLB awards, achievements, recordsAwards=== * MLB All-Star Game MVP (1962) * NL MVP: 1962 * NL Gold Glove (1961, 1962) ===Achievements=== * NL All-Star (1961–63, 1965–66) * NL leader in At Bats (1961, 1962) * NL leader in Triples (1962) * NL leader in Stolen Bases (1960–65) * NL leader in Singles (1961–62, 1965, 1967) * NL leader in Sacrifice Hits (1961) * Los Angeles Dodgers Career Stolen Base leader (490) ===Records=== * Most Games Played in a single season (165 in 1962) * 7th player to hit home runs from each side of the plate in a game (1962) * Stole 104 bases in 1962, still an MLB-record among switch-hitters * Los Angeles Dodgers Career Stolen Bases (490) * Los Angeles Dodgers Single-Season at Bats (695 in 1962) ==Other awards== * Hickok Belt Award (1962) * The Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals (class of 2011).\\"Shrine of the Eternals – Inductees\\".

Wills' 97th stolen base had occurred after his team had played its 154th game; as a result, Commissioner Ford Frick ruled that Wills' 104-steal season and Cobb's 96-steal season of 1915 were separate records, just as he had the year before (the American League had also increased its number of games played per team to 162) after Roger Maris had broken Babe Ruth's single season home run record. Both stolen base records would be broken in 1974 by Lou Brock's 118 steals; Brock had broken Cobb's stolen base record by stealing his 97th base before his St. Louis Cardinals had completed their 154th game. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball stolen base records * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual stolen base leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * Major League Baseball titles leaders ==References== ==Further reading== * \\"Maury Wills Set to Play Banjo at Dinner\\".

Upon his death, The New York Times had described him as one of India's most popular movie stars. Rajkumar entered the film industry after his long stint as a dramatist with Gubbi Veeranna's Gubbi Drama Company, which he joined at the age of eight before he got his first break as a lead in the 1954 film Bedara Kannappa. He went on to work in over 205 films essaying a variety of roles and excelling in portraying mythological and historical characters in films such as Bhakta Kanakadasa (1960), Ranadheera Kanteerava (1960), Satya Harishchandra (1965), Immadi Pulikeshi (1967), Sri Krishnadevaraya (1970), Bhakta Kumbara (1974), Mayura (1975), Babruvahana (1977) and Bhakta Prahlada (1983).

His father, Puttaswamayya and mother, Lakshmamma were impoverished theatre artists from Singanallur. Puttaswamayya was good at playing roles such as Kamsa, Ravana, and Hiranyakashipu. Rajkumar left school at eight and was later discovered by film producers, who cast him in bit roles that he played till he was 25. At birth, he was named Muthuraju, after the Muthaththi Raya (a name for the Hindu deity Hanuman), which is a temple deity located in Muthathi, a settlement on the banks of river Kaveri in present-day Karnataka. ==CareerAs actor=== Rajkumar started his career with his father in a troupe led by Gubbi Veeranna. In 1953, he was spotted by film director H. L. N. Simha, who was on the lookout for well-built, pleasant-faced for Bedara Kannappa. Simha eventually signed him for the film and named him Rajkumar. Before acting in Bedara Kannappa, Rajkumar appeared as a child artist in the 1942 film Bhakta Prahlada in a small role and had also appeared in the 1952 movie Sri Srinivasa Kalyana as Sage Agasthya —one of the Saptarishi (seven sages). It was an insignificant role in which his scene was over even before he recognized himself. He acted only in Kannada movies throughout his career apart from Kalahasti Mahatyam in Telugu, a remake of his debut Kannada movie Bedara Kannappa. He acted in 205 movies in lead roles. He owned a production company called Sri Vajreshwari Combines under the banner Dakshayani Combines. Bhagyada Bagilu was his 100th film, Devatha Manushya was his 200th film and Shabdavedhi was his last film. His character depictions ranged from mythological, historical, devotional, James Bond styled spies to romantic, rural, action roles and portrayals of contemporary social causes in the span of over five decades.

His movie Ondu Muttina Kathe was reported to be the first ever Indian film to have an underwater action sequence shot in an oceanhttp://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31806&articlexml;=DID- YOU-KNOW--21072017110007 outside India without the help of oxygen mask.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9H2VraGw0c Rajkumar's 1971 movie Kasturi Nivasa was colorized and released in 2014. Even close to a decade after his death, the movie garnered a grand opening with the actor’s life-size cutout being immersed in milk. The colorized release also performed well at the box office over taking other Kannada movies released at the time. ===As singer=== Rajkumar trained in classical music when he was with Gubbi Veeranna's theatre troupe. The track \\"Om Namaha Shivaya\\" from the 1956 film Ohileshwara, that he also starred in, was his first song for a film. He subsequently sang \\"Thumbithu Manava\\", a duet with S. Janaki, for the movie Mahishasura Mardini (1959). However, he became a full-fledged singer only in 1974 when he sang in place of P. B. Sreenivas for Sampathige Savaal, who had till then sung for most songs picturised on Rajkumar, fell ill. Rajkumar sang the energetic \\"Yaare Koogadali\\" for the film which became widely popular during the time and is considered one of his best songs. Rajkumar has been credited for having sung across various genres and each rendition according to the mood of the scene in the film. In \\"Yaaru Tiliyaru Ninna\\" for Babruvahana (1977), a prosodic form of Kannada poetry that required the tone to be a combination of sarcasm and anger, he blended the twin skills of theatrics and music. For Nee Nanna Gellalare (1981), he sang two songs — \\"Jeeva Hoovagide\\" and \\"Anuraga Enaytu\\"— beginning both with the refrain \\"I love you\\", that is full of Carnatic gamakas. After the same tone in the refrain, they take on a life of their own with the form according to love and happiness in the former and love but a discord in the latter. He is known widely for his rendition of \\"Nadamaya\\" for Jeevana Chaitra (1992), a song based on the raga of Todi and with complex graces and strings other ragas as it progresses. He switches ragas with ease, and sings complex swara patterns like a professional classical artiste. For the rendition, he was awarded the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer. His frequent collaboration with the composer duo of Rajan–Nagendra gave musical hits such as Bangarada Hoovu (1967), Nyayave Devaru (1971), Swayamvara (1973), Sri Srinivasa Kalyana (1974), Nanobba Kalla (1979) and Chalisuva Modagalu (1982). Rajkumar's duets mostly recorded with S. Janaki and Vani Jairam. Other female singers who sang with him are P. Susheela, Bangalore Latha, K. S. Chitra, Manjula Gururaj, B. R. Chaya, Kasturi Shankar, Rathnamala Prakash, Sulochana and others. During his career, Rajkumar sang and performed for songs about Kannadigas, the Kannada language and culture, such as \\"Jenina Holeyo\\" from Chalisuva Modagalu, \\"Maanavanagi Huttidmele\\" from Jeevana Chaitra and \\"Huttidare Kannada\\" from the film Aakasmika. He sang a complete English song called \\"If You Come Today\\" (\\"Tick Tick Tick\\") in the movie—Operation Diamond Racket in 1978. This song became an internet meme in India following Rajkumar's demise in 2006. In later years, he lent his voice to a few actors and sang background solos. For the song Deepavali Deepavali from Muddina Maava, he provided playback to S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. This was a rare occasion. \\"Hrudaya Samudra Kalaki\\" from Ashwamedha and \\"Hey Dinakara\\" from Om are the two other popular songs sung by Rajkumar for other actors.https://m.rediff.com/movies/2006/apr/17songs.htm He also sang Kalidasa shlokas such as \\"Maanikya Veena\\" and ghazal-based songs such as \\"Sadaa Kannale\\", \\"Kanneera Dhaare\\" and \\"Yaava Kaviyu\\". Rajkumar recorded many devotional songs beginning in the 1970s for Columbia Recording Company starting with \\"Mantralayakke Hogona\\" in 1972. His widely popular LP record \\"Guruvara Bantamma\\" was also recorded during the time. In 1979, Sangeetha Cassettes became India's first licensed pre-recorded cassettes. Rajkumar sang the devotional songs glorifying the saint Raghavendra and the Hindu deity Hanuman. Apart from performing in about 75 musical nights, he has sung 300 movie songs and about 200 folk and devotional songs - the proceeds of which were given away to charity. ==Personal lifeFamily=== At the age of 24, Rajkumar married his 14-year-old cousin, Parvathamma, on 25 June 1953 in Nanjangud. It went ahead in accordance to the agreement that their fathers made following the latter's birth. Together, they had five children; sons Shiva, Raghavendra and Puneeth, and daughters Lakshmi and Poornima. Having lived a \\"hand to mouth existence\\" after marriage in a joint family that included 24 children in Madras, the family moved to Bengaluru in 1972, after Rajkumar began getting multiple film offers. == Abduction == On 30 July 2000, Rajkumar, his son-in-law Govindaraju and two others were abducted by Veerappan from the actor's palatial house at Gajanur . Veerappan demanded the release of his gang members who were being held in jail under a defunct anti-terrorism law. The event prompted a massive manhunt and threw the Karnataka government into crisis. The Supreme Court of India opined that it was \\"unpardonable\\" on the part of the government of Tamil Nadu for not providing security to Rajkumar, although they had information a year earlier that he faced a threat of being kidnapped by Veerappan. A Special Task Force (STF) set up to capture Veerapan had earlier warned Rajkumar against visiting the farmhouse, but his son Raghavendra later acknowledged that his father had not taken the threat seriously.Veerappan's prize catch. The Hindu (20 December 1998). After a total of 108 days in captivity, Rajkumar was released unharmed on 15 November 2000. His abduction and the manner in which his release was secured remains a mystery. == Death and memorial == Jayanagar On 12 April 2006, Rajkumar returned to his Sadashivanagar residence after his regular 20-minute walk and had a general medical check-up by 11:30 a.m. (IST). At 1:50 pm (IST), as he sat on a sofa, he asked a member of his family to slow the fan down and immediately collapsed. His personal physician Ramana Rao was called for, who rushed within three minutes, and performed external cardiac massage and mouth- to-mouth resuscitation. Rajkumar was then taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and was administered intracardiac injections. Efforts to revive him failed and he was pronounced dead at 2:05 pm (IST). His death occurred 12 days before his 77th birthday. His eyes were donated to two visually impaired persons the same day. Rajkumar's death triggered an outpouring of grief. There was major shutdown in the city of Bengaluru. An unofficial bandh (closure of all shops and other establishments) was observed. Several people attempted suicide after hearing the news; most of them were rescued. The funeral cortège the next day started from Sree Kanteerava Stadium to Kanteerava Studios a few minutes before 12:30 pm (IST), a distance of . Around two million people followed his remains. However, the entire procession was marked with violence with mourners attacking public property, and police, who resorted to lathi- charge and tear gas. Passing through Krishna Raja Circle, Palace Road, T. Chowdiah Road, Sadashivanagar, Yeswanthpur and Goraguntepalya localities, the cortège reached the Studios at 4:45 pm (IST). His body was buried with State honors at 5:45 p.m (IST) at the premises of the studios. The last rites were performed by his eldest son Shiva, guided by priests from the city's ISKCON and the Gayathri Temples. The then President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had condoled his death. In the condolence message, he had praised his versatility and everlasting contributions to the Indian cinema. On 19 April, the government of Karnataka announced that a memorial would be made in Rajkumar's honor at Kanteerava Studios in association with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce at the cost 100 million. The blueprint of the memorial was cleared by a panel comprising members of Rajkumar's family, representatives of the Kannada film industry and the state government. After a delay over allocation of funds and land, it was finally opened in November 2014, after a sum of 70 million was used in developing it over an area of . It included \\"an open-air auditorium, mini-water body, landscaping and a bust\\" of Rajkumar. 40 photographs of selected films of Rajkumar were kept on display at the inauguration. A permanent exhibition on the history of Rajkumar's films that included his photographs, trophies and souvenirs, alongside a stock of dialogue, scripts, songs and other memorabilia associated with him were put on display. An annual calendar for 2012 was released containing photographs of Rajkumar and stills from his films. His fan clubs conduct blood donation and eye donation camps on the occasion of his birth and death anniversaries every year. ==Acting Versatality== It was observed that after 15 years into his career, in the mid sixties, when new young filmmakers were searching for actors who were less theatrical, Rajkumar had to undergo a transformation in his acting style and succeeded in proving that he could handle roles which were subtle, mellow and soft without the need for theatrical histrionics. He went on to be known for portraying versatile roles with elan. He was also praised for his ability to integrate the virtues of an actor with the power of a superstar without letting one erase the another by acting as a gulf between the mainstream popular movies and the artistic cinemas. It was also noted that it was his subtle acting prowess, spontaneous style and his flair to give the reel characters a real credibility which singled him out to the top and helped him to never be out of the running by withstanding the onslaught of time, age and the ever changing demands of celluloid world. Jnanapith awardee U. R. Ananthamurthy had noted that movies of Rajkumar were less melodramatic in comparison to the movies of his counterparts at that time in other languages—MGR, Sivaji Ganesan and NTR. Amitabh Bachchan had praised Rajkumar's simplicity and his ability to perform any role to perfection. Anil Kapoor called him the \\"emperor of all the actors\\" and a pride of Indian film industry. Girish Kasaravalli had called him a great actor by any standards. Jayanth Kaikini had said that the variety and intensity which Rajkumar had managed as an actor was unmatched world over. When Rajkumar completed 200 movies in lead roles in Kannada films, P. Lankesh edited a special issue of Lankesh Patrike in 1988 titled Innooru Chitragala Raja dedicating to him. == Social Themes of movies == Rajkumar made movies against perceived social evils throughout his career - right from his first movie till the last movie. His debut movie Bedara Kannappa (1954) spoke about social discrimination.https://www.telugucinema.com/Bhakta-Kannappa-1976-Retrospective The 1957 movie Rayara Sose speaks against the evil practice of dowry. The 1958 movie Shree Krishna Gaarudi, which narrates the bickering and squabbling among the Pandavas for portfolios, allegorizes the politics in the then newly formed Mysore state. The 1962 movie Bhoodana was based Vinoba Bhave's Bhoodan movement. The 1964 movie Naandi was acclaimed for capturing the real-time plights of those with hearing impairments. The 1967 movie Bangarada Hoovu spoke about misconceptions about leprosy. The 1968 movie Hannele Chiguridaga deals with the empowerment of women in education and widow marriage. The 1969 movie Mayor Muthanna had a sub-plot of salvaging of the sub-standard grain and black marketing. The 1971 movie Sakshatkara speaks about superstitions and manipulation of beliefs.https://www.sunnxt.com/movie/detail/17425/sakshatkara The central theme of 1972 movie Bangaarada Manushya - returning to one's ancestral village - inspired youth to take up agriculture. The film also touched on very important topics like rural development, modern agricultural practices and co-operative movement. The 1973 movie Bidugade speaks about capital punishment based on circumstantial evidence be done away with. The 1973 movie Gandhada Gudi was reported to be the first Indian movie made on the concept of protection of forest and wildlife conservation with a focus on the need to preserve the flora and fauna at a time when the CITES treaty was signed with an aim to reduce the economic incentive to poach endangered species. The 1974 movie Sampathige Savaal speaks subtely about the abolishment of Zamindar system by portraying the rich versus poor in a rural backdrop. The 1985 movie Jwaalamukhi speaks about marks card forgery. The 1985 movie Dhruva Thare speaks about the oppression by the higher class and the need for the minimum wages. The 1986 movie Anuraga Aralithu speaks about the implementation of labour reforms in factory. The 1987 movie Shruthi Seridaaga made a strong statement against believing horoscope blindly. The 1992 movie Jeevana Chaitra instigated many villages to ban arrack shops. The 1993 movie Aakasmika was about woman trafficking and prostitution racquet. His last movie Shabdavedhi (2000) was about drug abuse and its ill effects on the youth. == Mass Appeal & Popularity== Veteran journalist and writer Patil Puttappa had described Rajkumar as a natural strength of Kannada whose mass appeal was much more than any leader in Indian politics. He was also praised for confining himself to the Kannada cinema through a conscious decision. His movies were praised for showing consistent interest in building a Kannada society and not a Kannada nation as such. His presence was reported to have filled the void between the state and the nation which neither the littérateurs nor the politicians could accomplish. Some observers are of the opinion that his star appeal helped bring together the diverse regions of Karnataka. The state was carved out in 1956, bringing together different regions like Hyderabad Karnataka, which were areas ruled by the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad; Mumbai Karnataka, which has a strong Marathi influence; Old Mysore region ruled by the Mysore royal family and the hilly regions and coastal belt. Each region has a distinct identity within the state and Rajkumar was accepted as a Kannada icon across all regions. He spoke Kannada in a distinct way which had a universal appeal across the state. This was an important aspect since his career played out when the state's identity was still evolving. Rajkumar's movies were largely credited for creating a unified Kannada cultural space after the formation of the state. It was reported that before linguistic reorganization of the states, the default state border for the Kannada speaking population was the last point where Rajkumar films were distributed. He was considered as a strong symbol of Kannada identity. He had even refused to appear in a cameo for Amitabh Bachchan's 1983 Hindi movie Coolie. In spite of having appeared only in Kannada movies, he was reasonably popular amongst the non- Kannadigas too. His films have inspired many non-Kannadigas to learn the language. During the interview for promotions of 2.0, Rajinikanth had said that 10 MGRs were equal to 1 Rajkumar.https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v;=tFgL4FfRZ1w He has also remarked that the only autograph he has ever taken in his life is of Rajkumar. Rajinikanth had also said that Rajkumar was a combination of MGR and Sivaji Ganesan. After Rajkumar's eyes were donated as per his last wish, the eye donation in Karnataka was reported to have increased by 400%. The initial move to shift the operations of the Kannada cinema gradually from Madras to Bangalore has been credited to Rajkumar's home productions. As of April 2016, 71 books and 9 souvenirs have been published on Rajkumar. On the occasion of his 90th birthday, an audio-visual musical extravaganza fund raiser programme titled Raj Vaibhava was conducted in Greater Boston for the benefit of a retirement home in Mumbai.https://indianewengland.com/2019/03/celebrating-90-years-of-rajkumar- the-kannada-matinee-idol/ ===Politics=== Political analyst MK Bhaskar Rao had revealed that the Janata Party's J. H. Patel and George Fernandes had approached Rajkumar to contest against Indira Gandhi in the 1978 Chikkamagaluru Lok Sabha byelection but he refused saying he wanted to remain apolitical. The Hindu had reported that Rajkumar could have swept any poll effortlessly but had decided that the affection and love of the people should not be used to attain power.This 'Sarkar', hardly rules. The Hindu (8 November 2018). Retrieved 12 November 2018. It was also reported that Rajkumar declined to enter politics despite immense pressure as he didn't want to be used only as a weapon to defeat anyone and not for any positive contribution. He shunned publicity and politics all his life. He was also credited for protecting and promoting the Kannada language without opting for a political career. ==Lifestyle== Rajkumar was best regarded by Kannada audiences and the Kannada film industry for being a highly disciplined man in both his personal and professional lives. He practised Carnatic music for an hour each day in the morning and in the evening. He was referred to as Gaanagandharva. His punctuality is another noted aspect. Waking up every morning at 4 am, he performed Yoga and Pranayama, which is said to be the reason behind his physical and mental fitness. His Yoga performances can be seen in the first clips of his film Kaamana Billu.Yoga keeps Rajkumar going. The Times of India. 16 August 2000. His waist size was 32 at the time of his death. This fitness is attributed to his practice of Yoga. He shunned smoking and drinking both on screen and off. To avoid setting a precedent among his fans, he made sure that the roles he accepted did not require him to smoke or drink or utter swear words, and extended this decision to real life. His dress code always consisted of a simple white dhoti and shirt. He spent most of his vacations in his hometown, Gajanur, near the forest area where he was later abducted.Times of India – Gajanur awaits the return of the native. The Times of India. (12 November 2001). He would always refer to his movie-producers as Anna Daataru (food providers) and adored fans as Abhimaani Devarugalu (Fan Gods).After losing breadwinners, these families struggle to eke out a decent living – KARNATAKA. The Hindu (12 April 2007). Retrieved 12 November 2018. He was a devotee of Raghavendra Swami. In 1961, he had lead a movement to collect funds for draught relief. Girish Kasaravalli had praised his simplicity, humility, innocence and straight-forwardness. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao called him as one of the two funniest people he has come across in his life. S.P.Balasubrahmanyam had praised his courteous and down to earth nature. Reminiscing his old days, Kannada director J.G.Krishna had revealed that Rajkumar was responsible for light boys being served food by the film production team after he came to know that they were not being served food on the sets and took initiative to make it mandatory for all Kannada film producers to bear the food cost of the light boys treating them on par with the employees of the production house.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp6wx7U6ydI&feature;=youtu.be A touching testimonial to his commitment to lead by example was that he had pledged his eyes in 1994 at the time of inauguration of Dr. Rajkumar Eye Bank and he rightly did so after his death in 2006. His act of eye donation was likened to the role in his debut movie Bedara Kannappa where he plucks his eyes in the climax to replace the bleeding eyes of the Shivalinga. ==Kannada language movement== Although Rajkumar rejected numerous offers to don the political mantle, he was able to influence the State's political fortunes without ever being officially involved in politics. However, his apolitical outlook did not prevent him from protecting and espousing the cause of Kannada and Karnataka. He had time and again advocated the cause of seeking primacy to Kannada, and hence was asked to lead a movement about making Kannada a compulsory language for primary education based on the \\"Gokak report\\", popularly known as Gokak Varadhi. He became actively involved in the movement and soon became the force behind the Gokak movement. He took a rally from Belagavi to Bengaluru and gave speeches about the importance of Kannada Gokak agitation. Millions of people gathered only to have a glimpse of Rajkumar and listen to his speech. The movement became such a rage that the government relented and made Kannada a compulsory language of education in Karnataka. == Filmography == ==Awards and honours== Stamp of Dr. Rajkumar in 2009 Rajkumar was awarded numerous State, National and International awards. He was a recipient of the Padma Bhushan, a doctorate from Mysore University and the Karnataka Ratna, the highest civilian honour of the State of Karnataka, recognising him as a Jewel of Karnataka State. In 1985, he was honored by a famous Kentucky colonel award by the then- governor of Kentucky, United States. By this, he became the only Indian actor to receive this prestige from the state of Kentucky, USA. In 1995, he received the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award for his outstanding contributions to the Kannada film industry. In 2011, during the 83rd birth anniversary of Rajkumar, the Chief Minister of Karnataka announced that the state government is recommending Rajkumar for a Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of the country for his outstanding contribution to the film industry.State to recommend Raj for Bharat Ratna.

Originally, this term applied only to crew members that were present at the ship's first commissioning. Today, however, plankowner is often applied to members of newly commissioned units, new military bases and recommissioning crews as well.\\"Plank Owners, Plank Owner Certificates, and Planking\\", Naval Historical Center ==In U.S. military== Plankowner is a term used by the United States Navy, and has consequently been variously defined by different units.

Historically, a plankowner in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, or his widow, could petition the Naval Historical Center's Curator Branch for a piece of the deck when the ship was decommissioned. This practice has been discontinued and stocks of planking that existed at the Curator branch have been donated to various veteran's organizations. Sailors who are plankowners at their current command often have the word \\"PLANKOWNER\\" embroidered on the back of their uniform ball cap to denote this designation.

Additional ingredients, such as vegetable oils, salt, food coloring, or sugar may be included. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist. Processed cheese typically contains around 50-60% natural cheese. Its invention is credited to Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland, in 1911. == Advantages == A slice of processed cheese Processed cheese has several technical advantages over natural cheese, including a far longer shelf life, resistance to separating when cooked (meltability), and a uniform look and physical behavior. Its mass- produced nature provides arguably its greatest advantage over natural cheese: a dramatically lower cost — to producers and consumers alike — than conventional cheesemaking. This, in turn, enables industrial-scale production volumes, lower distribution costs, a steadier supply, and much faster production time compared to traditional cheeses. The use of emulsifiers in processed cheese results in a product that melts without separating when cooked; with prolonged heating, some natural cheeses (especially cheddar and mozzarella) separate into a lumpy, molten protein gel and liquid fat combination. The emulsifiers (typically sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, tartrate, or citrate) reduce the tendency for tiny fat globules in the cheese to coalesce and pool on the surface. Because processed cheese does not separate when melted, it is used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. Unlike some unprocessed cheeses, heating does not alter its taste or texture. == Sale and labeling == Processed cheese is often sold in blocks, pressurized cans, and packs of individual slices, often separated by wax paper, or with each slice individually wrapped by machine. === United Kingdom === In the United Kingdom, processed cheese is typically sold in individually wrapped slices, often referred to as \\"singles\\", or in foil-wrapped portions. Dairylea and The Laughing Cow are leading brands. === United States === American cheese is a processed cheese. Pictured here in a single wrapped slice. In 1916, Canadian James L. Kraft applied for the first U.S. patent for a method of making processed cheese.Kraft, James Lewis, \\"Process of sterilizing cheese and an improved product produced by such process,\\" U.S. patent no. 1,186,524 (filed: March 25, 1916 ; issued: June 6, 1916). However, Kraft's process did not include the use of emulsifiers in processed cheese. The first U.S. patent for the use of emulsifiers was awarded in 1921 to George Herbert Garstin: * Garstin, George Herbert \\"Cheese and process for sterilizing same,\\" U.S. patent no. 1,368,624 (filed: October 28, 1920 ; issued: February 15, 1921). * Kraft Foods developed the first commercially available, shelf-stable, sliced, processed cheese; it was introduced in 1950. This form of sliced cheese (and its derivatives) have become ubiquitous in U.S. households ever since, most notably used for cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches because of its ability to cook evenly, distribute/stretch smoothly, and resist congealing, unlike traditional cheddar cheeses. Competitors lobbied unsuccessfully to require processed cheese be labeled \\"embalmed cheese\\". The first commercially available, individually wrapped, cheese slices were introduced in the U.S. by Clearfield Cheese Co. in 1956. U.S. Patent 2759308 by Arnold Nawrocki was assigned to Clearfield Cheese Co. in 1956. The best known processed cheese in the United States is marketed as American cheese by Kraft Foods, Borden, and other companies. It is yellow or off-white, mild, has a medium consistency and melts easily. It is typically made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and cheddar. Another type of processed cheese created in the United States is Provel pizza cheese, which uses cheddar, Swiss, and provolone cheeses as flavorants. Provel cheese is commonly used in St. Louis-style pizza. == Legal definitions == Owing to its highly mechanized (i.e., assembly line) methods of production, and additive ingredients (e.g., oils, salts, or colors), some softer varieties of processed cheese cannot legally be labeled as actual \\"cheese\\" in many countries, even those in which slightly harder varieties can be. Such products tend to be classified as \\"cheese food\\", \\"cheese spread\\", or \\"cheese product\\" (depending primarily on the amount of cheese, moisture, and milkfat present in the final product). === United States === A gift pack containing several varieties of labeled process cheese. Upper left: a \\"pasteurized process cheese food\\" and a \\"pasteurized processed cheese spread\\" Upper center: a \\"pasteurized process cheese spread Havarti-type flavor\\" Lowermost right: a \\"pasteurized process cheese food with jalapeño peppers\\" In the United States, processed cheese is defined, categorized, and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Section 133 (Cheeses and Cheese Related Products).Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Article 133, Section 169 (Pasteurized process cheese), the allowed usage of the term \\"American Cheese\\" for certain types of \\"Pasteurized process cheese\\" is detailed. Specifically, in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of section 133.169, it states, \\"In case it is made of cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, or granular cheese or any mixture of two or more of these, it may be designated 'Pasteurized process American cheese'; or when cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these is combined with other varieties of cheese in the cheese ingredient, any of such cheeses or such mixture may be designated as 'American cheese'.\\" Refer to U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs) Article 133 (Cheeses and Cheese Related Products) at the U.S. Government Printing Office. Pasteurized process cheese can be made from a single cheese, or a blend of several cheeses. Cream, milk fat, water, salt, artificial color, and spices may also be added. The mixture is heated with an emulsifier, poured into a mold, and allowed to cool. The definitions include: * Pasteurized process cheese, which is made from one or more cheeses (excluding certain cheeses such as cream cheese and cottage cheese but including American cheese). Moisture not more than 41 percent; fat in the solids, not less than 49 percent. * Pasteurized process cheese food, which is made from not less than 51 percent by final weight of one or more \\"optional cheese ingredients\\" (similar to the cheeses available for pasteurized process cheese), mixed with one or more \\"optional dairy ingredients\\" (milk, whey, etc.), and which may contain one or more specified \\"optional ingredients\\" (nondairy). Moisture must be <44 percent, and fat content >23 percent. * Pasteurized process cheese spread, which is made similarly to pasteurized process cheese food but must be spreadable at 70 °F. Moisture must be between 44-60 percent, and fat content >20 percent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not maintain a standard of identity for \\"pasteurized prepared cheese product\\", a designation which particularly appears on many Kraft products. Nor does the FDA maintain a standard of identity for \\"pasteurized process cheese product\\" (emphasis on the trailing \\"Product\\"), a designation which appears particularly on many American store- and generic-branded singles. Products labeled as such may use milk protein concentrate (MPC) in the formulation, an ingredient which does not appear in the above FDA definitions. The desire to use inexpensive imported milk protein concentrate is noted as motivation for the introduction of these and similar terms, and for the relabeling of some products.\\"U.S. Imports of Concentrated Milk Proteins: What We Know and Don't Know?\\", Jesse, Marketing and Policy Briefing Paper No. 80, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin- Madison Cooperative Extension, University of Wisconsin-Extension, February 2003.

The current resolution determined that \\"the magnitude of human tragedy caused by the conflict in Somalia, further exacerbated by the obstacles being created to the distribution of humanitarian assistance [constitutes] a threat to international peace and security\\". The Council once again, strongly condemned violations of international humanitarian law and demanded the cessation of all hostilities from all parties involved, urging them to co-operate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and military, including allowing access by military personnel and humanitarian organisations to the affected population and to ensure their safety. It also authorised a further deployment of 3,500 personnel of the United Nations Operation in Somalia I (UNISOM I) created in Resolution 775 to Somalia and informing it should proceed at the discretion of the Secretary-General. The resolution went on to endorse a recommendation by the Secretary-General that action should be taken under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and welcomed offers by Member States concerning the creation of an operation to create a secure environment for humanitarian operations, that later became known as UNITAF. At the time of his report, disarmament and the problem of security was not resolved. The Council authorised such action to be taken by Member States, and appointed an ad hoc commission composed of members of the Security Council to report on the implementation of the current resolution. Acting under Chapter VII and Chapter VIII, the Council urged states and agencies to ensure strict implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia imposed in Resolution 733. Resolution 794 ended by requiring states participating in UNITAF and the Secretary-General to report regularly on the progress they are making in Somalia so that arrangements can be handed back over to UNISOM II. Within days of passing the current resolution, on 9 December 1992, the first UNITAF troops arrived in the Somali capital, Mogadishu. It was the first Security Council resolution that authorised the use of force under Chapter VII to deliver humanitarian aid that was being obstructed by warlords, and the fourth major military engagement since the Cold War, following the invasion of Kuwait, the deployment of peacekeepers in Cambodia and a further deployment of peacekeepers in Yugoslavia. ==See also== * History of Somalia * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 701 to 800 (1991–1993) * Somali Civil War ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0794 Category:1992 in Somalia 0794 Category:United Nations operations in Somalia Category:December 1992 events ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 794"},{"id":"515482","text":"The German Academic Exchange Service or DAAD (), founded in 1925, is the largest German support organisation in the field of international academic co- operation. ==Organisation== DAAD headquarters in Bonn DAAD scholarship in Germany is a private, federally funded and state-funded, self-governing national agency of the institutions of higher education in Germany, representing 365 German higher education institutions (100 universities and technical universities, 162 general universities of applied sciences, and 52 colleges of music and art) [2003].

In the initial stage of the program, 271 Syrians seen as suitable for university scholarships were chosen from potential candidates who were \\"either still living in Syria or in one of the bordering countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey), or who had fled to Germany\\". The former were then brought to Germany to join those participants who were already there. The scholarships were to various universities throughout Germany. The German Foreign Office funded the bulk of the scholarships (200) with the balance being sponsored by Baden Wurttemberg (50) and North Rhine Westphalia (21). The scholarship curriculum included an introductory language course for those students who were not already fluent in, or otherwise had no prior knowledge of, German. Alongside this was a concomitant obligatory element intended to imbue the planned future Syrian elite with the \\"fundamental and practical knowledge and skills in political sciences, economics, social sciences, as well as operational competence.\\" ==See also== * Franco-German University * List of Nobel laureates ==External links== *DAAD Homepage ==References== Category:Academic transfer Category:Government scholarships Category:Organizations established in 1925 Category:Higher education in Germany Category:Educational foundations Category:Foundations based in Germany Category:Organisations based in Bonn Category:Study abroad programs Category:Social engineering (political science) Category:German involvement in the Syrian Civil War ","title":"German Academic Exchange Service"},{"id":"515483","text":"Medusa is the second studio album by English hard rock band Trapeze.

NSE was established in 1992 as the first dematerialized electronic exchange in the country. NSE was the first exchange in the country to provide a modern, fully automated screen-based electronic trading system which offered easy trading facilities to investors spread across the length and breadth of the country. Vikram Limaye is Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of NSE. National Stock Exchange has a total market capitalization of more than 2.27 trillion, making it the world's 11th-largest stock exchange as of April 2018. NSE's flagship index, the NIFTY 50, a 50 stock index is used extensively by investors in India and around the world as a barometer of the Indian capital market. The NIFTY 50 index was launched in 1996 by NSE.https://www.nseindia.com/global/content/about_us/history_milestones.htm However, Vaidyanathan (2016) estimates that only about 4% of the Indian economy / GDP is actually derived from the stock exchanges in India. Unlike countries like the United States where nearly 70% of the country's GDP is derived from large companies in the corporate sector, the corporate sector in India accounts for only 12-14% of the national GDP (as of October 2016). Of these only 7,800 companies are listed of which only 4000 trade on the stock exchanges at BSE and NSE. Hence the stocks trading at the BSE and NSE account for only around 4% of the Indian economy, which derives most of its income- related activity from the so-called unorganized sector and household spending. Economic Times estimates that as of April 2018, 6 crore (60 million) retail investors had invested their savings in stocks in India, either through direct purchases of equities or through mutual funds. Earlier, the Bimal Jalan Committee report estimated that barely 1.3% of India's population invested in the stock market, as compared to 27% in the United States and 10% in China. ==History== National Stock Exchange was incorporated in the year 1992 to bring about transparency in the Indian equity markets. Instead of trading memberships being confined to a group of brokers, NSE ensured that anyone who was qualified, experienced and met the minimum financial requirements was allowed to trade. In this context, NSE was ahead of its time when it separated ownership and management of the exchange under SEBI's supervision. Stock price information which could earlier be accessed only by a handful of people could now be seen by a client in a remote location with the same ease. The paper- based settlement was replaced by electronic depository-based accounts and settlement of trades was always done on time. One of the most critical changes involved a robust risk management system that was set in place, to ensure that settlement guarantees would protect investors against broker defaults. NSE was set up by a group of leading Indian financial institutions at the behest of the Government of India to bring transparency to the Indian capital market. Based on the recommendations laid out by the Pherwani committee, NSE was established with a diversified shareholding comprising domestic and global investors. The key domestic investors include Life Insurance Corporation, State Bank of India, IFCI Limited , IDFC Limited and Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited. Key global investors include Gagil FDI Limited, GS Strategic Investments Limited, SAIF II SE Investments Mauritius Limited, Aranda Investments (Mauritius) Pte Limited and PI Opportunities Fund I. The exchange was incorporated in 1992 as a tax-paying company and was recognized as a stock exchange in 1993 under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, when P. V. Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister of India and Manmohan Singh was the Finance Minister. NSE commenced operations in the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment in June 1994. The capital market (equities) segment of the NSE commenced operations in November 1994, while operations in the derivatives segment commenced in June 2000. NSE offers trading, clearing and settlement services in equity, equity derivative, debt, commodity derivatives, and currency derivatives segments. It was the first exchange in India to introduce an electronic trading facility thus connecting the investor base of the entire country. NSE has 2500 VSATs and 3000 leased lines spread over more than 2000 cities across India. NSE was also instrumental in creating the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) which allows investors to securely hold and transfer their shares and bonds electronically. It also allows investors to hold and trade in as few as one share or bond. This not only made holding financial instruments convenient but more importantly, eliminated the need for paper certificates and greatly reduced incidents involving forged or fake certificates and fraudulent transactions that had plagued the Indian stock market. The NSDL's security, combined with the transparency, lower transaction prices and efficiency that NSE offered, greatly increased the attractiveness of the Indian stock market to domestic and international investors. === NSE EMERGE === NSE EMERGE is NSE's new initiative for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) & Startup companies in India. These companies can get listed on NSE without an Initial public offering (IPO). This platform will help SME's & Startups connect with investors and help them with the raising of funds.

Successful candidates are awarded joint certification from NSE and the concerned. == NSE co-location case == On 8 July 2015, Sucheta Dalal wrote an article on Moneylife alleging that some NSE employees were leaking sensitive data related to high-frequency trading or co-location servers to a select set of market participants so that they could trade faster than their competitors. NSE alleged defamation in the article by Moneycontrol. On 22 July 2015, NSE filed a suit against Moneycontrol. However, on 9 September 2015, the Bombay High Court dismissed the case and fined NSE in this defamation case against Moneycontrol (www.moneylife.in). The High Court asked NSE to pay to each journalist Debashis Basu and Sucheta Dalal and the remaining to two hospitals. The Bombay High Court has stayed the order on costs for a period of two weeks, pending the hearing of the appeal filed by NSE.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bombay-high- court-stays-order-imposing-rs-50-lakh-cost-on-nse/articleshow/49043716.cms In May 2019 SEBI has debarred NSE from accessing the markets for a period of 6 months. While NSE confirmed this will not impact their functioning, they won't be able to list their IPO or introduce any new trading products for that period. Additionally, the watchdog also ordered NSE to disgorge Rs 624.9 crores (along with accrued interest for the period), an amount equivalent to the profits it made from the unfair trade practice of co-location servers they provided during the period from 2010–11 to 2013–14. The board also passed orders against 16 individuals including former managing directors and CEOs Ravi Narain and Chitra Ramakrishna ordering them to disgorge 25% of their salaries during that period along with interest. All money is to be paid into the Investor protection and education fund. These individuals have also been debarred from the markets or holding any position in a listed company for a period of five years. == See also == * Stock market crashes in India * Companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India * List of stock exchanges in the Commonwealth of Nations * List of South Asian stock exchanges * Mahurat trading * Clause 49 * Bombay Stock Exchange *NSE EMERGE ==References== ==External links== * Category:Stock exchanges in India Category:Financial services companies based in Mumbai Category:Companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Category:Financial services companies established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in India ","title":"National Stock Exchange of India"},{"id":"515493","text":"DAAD may refer to: * The German Academic Exchange Service (German Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst) ** DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program * Direct Action Against Drugs, a cover name for the Provisional Irish Republican Army * Damnation and a Day, a 2003 album by extreme metal band Cradle of Filth * Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship, a political group in Thailand ","title":"DAAD"},{"id":"515495","text":"Trapeze is the debut studio album by British hard rock band Trapeze. Recorded in 1969 at Morgan Studios and Decca Studios, it was produced by the Moody Blues bassist John Lodge and released in May 1970 as the second album on Threshold Records, a record label founded by Lodge's band. Trapeze is the band's only album to feature founding member John Jones (vocals, trumpet); both he and Terry Rowley (organ, piano, flute) left shortly after its release (Rowley rejoined in 1974) Contrary to the band's later material, which was primarily categorised as hard rock, Trapeze has been described by commentators as a progressive or psychedelic rock album, owing partly to the presence of brass instruments and keyboards on the album. Songwriting was typically led by Jones, Galley and Hughes, with Rowley also co-writing two tracks. \\"Send Me No More Letters\\" was released as the only single from the album in 1969, backed with fellow album track \\"Another Day\\". ==Background and release== Trapeze was formed in March 1969 by former The Montanas members John Jones (vocals, trumpet) and Terry Rowley (organ, guitar, piano, flute), along with former Finders Keepers members Mel Galley (guitar, vocals), Glenn Hughes (bass, piano, vocals) and Dave Holland (drums). The five-piece recorded their self- titled debut album later in the year at London's Morgan Studios and Decca Studios. The recordings were produced by John Lodge, whose band the Moody Blues had earlier signed Trapeze as the first act to their new record label Threshold Records. \\"Send Me No More Letters\\" was released as a single in 1969, and Trapeze was released in May 1970. The album was the band's only release to feature Jones and Rowley, both of whom left shortly after its release to return to The Montanas. ==Composition and style== The material featured on Trapeze was primarily written by Galley, Hughes and Jones – Galley was credited on seven tracks, Hughes and Jones on five each, and Rowley on two. Despite being the band's primary vocalist, Jones only contributed trumpet to the album, with Hughes being credited for all vocals on the release. The style of the album has been described by commentators as a mix between progressive rock, psychedelic rock and pop rock, with AllMusic's Bruce Eder claiming that \\"Those listeners who only know the subsequent albums by Trapeze may be surprised by this debut effort\\" due to their later hard rock style. The album was compared stylistically to the work of other British rock acts of the period, including Lodge's band the Moody Blues and Hughes's future group Deep Purple (particularly the first three albums). In the liner notes for a 2004 reissue of the album by Lemon Recordings, journalist Nigel Williamson described Trapeze as \\"a classic period example of English prog, mixing pastoral whimsy, swirling psychedelia, rock guitars and pop harmonies\\". Similarly, Eder identified that the album featured an array of \\"lush choruses, psychedelic interludes, and hook-laden romantic ballads\\", amounting to \\"high- energy music within the context of psychedelic pop/rock\\". ==Critical reception== Media response to Trapeze was generally positive. Eder praised the performances of the \\"core trio\\" of Galley, Hughes and Holland, who he claimed \\"[found] a good compromise with Rowley and Jones' more lyrical, psychedelic pop sensibilities\\", but noted that \\"it's clear that three of these musicians are holding back to one degree or another in these surroundings\\". He also highlighted \\"Fairytale\\" and \\"Am I\\" as the album's standout songs, which he claimed \\"[pointed] the way to [the band's] future sound\\" following their reduction to the aforementioned trio. Billboard hailed Trapeze as \\"a candidate for big chart action\\", praising the performance in particular of Hughes, highlighting \\"Send Me No More Letters\\" and \\"Fairytale\\", and praising the band's \\"strong rock personality\\" on the record. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1970 debut albums Category:Trapeze (band) albums Category:Threshold Records albums ","title":"Trapeze (1970 album)"},{"id":"515505","text":"Tongue ( from ) is a coastal village in northwest Highland, Scotland, in the western part of the former county of Sutherland. It lies on the east shore above the base of the Kyle of Tongue and north of the mountains Ben Hope and Ben Loyal on the A836. To the north lies the area of Braetongue. Tongue is the main village in a series of crofting townships that runs through Coldbackie, Dalharn, Blandy, and the harbour of Scullomie to the deserted township of Slettel. The village includes a youth hostel, a craft shop, a general store and garage, a bank, a post office and two hotels, the Tongue Hotel and the Ben Loyal Hotel. It is connected to the west side of the Kyle by the Kyle of Tongue Bridge and Causeway, built in 1971. ==Toponymy== Contrary to popular belief, the name Tongue does not refer to the shape of the Kyle of Tongue (though the kyle can be described as \\"tongue-shaped\\"). Rather it is a geographical term in Old Norse which refers to a piece of land shaped like a spit or tongue. That tongue of land projecting into the Kyle is the terminal moraine of the Kyle of Tongue glacier, and forms the eastern part of the Kyle of Tongue causeway. In Gaelic, Tunga indicates the village, whereas Caol Thunga indicates the kyle. The village is also known as Ceann Tàile and formerly as Circeabol. ==History== The area was an historic crossroad for Gaels, Picts and Vikings. Tongue House is the historic seat of the Clan Mackay, after they abandoned Castle Varrich (Caisteal Bharraich). The ruins of the castle, built at Tongue in the eleventh century after the clan were expelled from their ancestral Province of Moray to County Sutherland, are a popular tourist attraction. A battle for succession some time around 1427 to 1433 culminated in the Battle of Drumnacoub, in which two factions of the clan fought on Carn Fada, between the Kyle and Ben Loyal. The village saw a key battle between a Jacobite treasure ship and two ships of the Royal Navy in 1746, which resulted in the Jacobite crew trying to slip ashore with their gold. They were then caught by the Navy, supported by local people who were loyal to Hanover, which cost Bonnie Prince Charlie valuable support in the run-up to Culloden. In the Highland Clearances, many people who were cleared from the interior of Sutherland moved to this village. The Gaelic poet Ewen Robertson (, 1842–95) lived in Tongue his entire life, and is most famous for his song \\"Mo mhallachd aig na caoraich mhòr\\" (\\"My curses on the Border sheep\\") mocking, among others, the Duchess of Sutherland and Patrick Sellar. The song has been recorded by notable singers Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes. There is a monument to Robertson in Tongue. The American statesman George W. Campbell was born in Tongue. ==See also== * Tongue Bay ==Notes and references== * * Category:Populated places in Sutherland Category:National scenic areas of Scotland Category:Protected areas of Highland (council area) ","title":"Tongue, Highland"},{"id":"515508","text":"The Pembroke Welsh Corgi (; Welsh for \\"dwarf dog\\") is a cattle herding dog breed that originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, and both descend from the line of northern spitz-type dogs (such as the Siberian Husky).separate and distinct breed from the Cardigan. The corgi is one of the smallest herding dogs. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 during her reign. Although these dogs have been favored by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the British public, they have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand. However, they remain very popular in the United States. Cities such as New York, Boston, and Los Angeles hold annual \\"Corgi Meetups\\" in which hundreds of dogs and their owners congregate to spend the day. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked 11th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which states that the breed is considered an excellent working dog. According to the American Kennel Club, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 13th most popular breed of dog in 2018. ==Description== Pembroke Welsh Corgi ===Appearance=== The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears that are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The breed standard indicates that the ears should be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be \\"fox-like\\" in shape and appearance. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a \\"fairy saddle\\", somewhat lighter markings on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds mostly in the spring and autumn and may shed annually, with intact females shedding during heat. Breed faults exist; some which may acknowledge genetic health conditions such as \\"fluffies\\" which are corgis with very long coats, and \\"bluies,\\" which have a dilute colour (red coats present with a bluish cast). While some outlying Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short or missing, the majority often have their tails docked between 2–5 days old due to historical tradition or to conform to the Breed Standard.PWCCA Standard of Perfection Artificial docking was needed for the dog to do its job as a herding dog in the United Kingdom. A non-herding, \\"companion\\" dog was considered a luxury under tax law and attracted a tax, so to demonstrate that their dogs were herding dogs, owners had to ensure the dogs had docked or bobbed tails. The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than . In many countries, docking has been deemed illegal. ===Temperament=== Pembroke Welsh Corgis are very affectionate, love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs are easy to train and are ranked as the eleventh most intelligent dog in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets. It is important to socialize this breed with other animals, adults, and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behaviour or aggression later in life. Due to their herding instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owners' ankles. ==Health== Pembroke leaving teeter-totter during a dog agility competition. Pembrokes have an average life expectancy of 12–15 years. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are achondroplastic, meaning they are a \\"true dwarf\\" breed. As such, their stature and build can lead to certain non-inherited health conditions, but genetic issues should also be considered. Commonly, Pembrokes can suffer from monorchidism, Von Willebrand's disease, hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy (DM), and inherited eye problems such as progressive retinal atrophy. Genetic testing is available for Pembroke Welsh Corgis to avoid these issues and enhance the genetic health pool. Pembrokes are also prone to obesity given a robust appetite, characteristic of herding group breeds. ==History== The Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as 1107 AD. It is said that Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales. Ancient lore states that two children were running through a forest and stumbled upon the funeral of a fairy. The mourning fairies gave the two children two small corgi puppies and the children took them home, thus giving the breed popularity. Stories also state that Corgis played the role of war horses for fairies before they became herding dogs for humans. At the base of the haunches of Corgis, there is a line of slightly rougher fur that ancient Welsh lore states is the saddle line from fairy warriors. Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later. Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorized together under the single heading of Welsh Corgis before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct in 1934. Pembroke Welsh Corgi around 3 months old Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 20th (24th) in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2015 (2012). However, corgis are now listed as a \\"vulnerable\\" breed in the United Kingdom; the decline has been said to be due to a 2007 ban on tail-docking (the practice of cutting off the animal's tail) in the U.K., as well as the lack of breeders in the U.K. In 2009, the corgi was added to The Kennel Club's \\"At Watch\\" list of British breeds when annual registrations numbered between 300 and 450. In 2014, the breed was put on the Club's \\"Vulnerable Native Breeds\\" list when registrations dropped under 300. In 2018, the breed came off the \\"At-Risk\\" list with 456 puppies registered in December 2017. The Kennel Club has credited the renewed interest in the breed to the popular Netflix television series, The Crown. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has also appeared in the American television Brooklyn Nine-Nine as the pet dog of Captain Raymond Holt and Kevin M. Cozner and is shown to be extremely loyal. A Corgi with human-level intelligence is one of the 5 main characters in the TV show Cowboy Bebop. ==Activities== Pembroke Welsh Corgis can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Corgis, despite their dwarfism giving the illusion of small slow legs, can reach up to 25 mph if they are healthy and fit. This is because Corgis tend to use more upper body strength to run than most dogs, giving them enhanced abilities with such activities as agility and herding and racing. ==Queen Elizabeth's Corgis== At a young age, the Queen's passion for this breed started when her father, King George VI, brought home their first royal corgi who was later named “Dookie”. The Queen ceased breeding corgis around 2012 so as not to leave any behind after she dies; her last corgi, Willow, died 18 April 2018. On April 3 2019, the film The Queen's Corgi was released. ==References== ==External links== Category: FCI breeds Category: Dog breeds originating in Wales Category: Herding dogs Category: Spitz breeds ","title":"Pembroke Welsh Corgi"},{"id":"515514","text":"Puch () is a manufacturing company located in Graz, Austria (Former Austria- Hungary). The company was founded in 1899 by the industrialist Johann Puch and produced automobiles, bicycles, mopeds, and motorcycles. It was a subsidiary of the large Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate. ==HistoryFoundation=== Johann Puch in the 1890s From 1889 Johann Puch (1862–1914) worked as an agent for Humber vehicles and manufacturer of Styria safety bicycles in a small workshop in Graz and in 1890 he founded his first company, Johann Puch & Comp., employing 34 workers. Cyclists like Josef Fischer, winning the first edition of Paris–Roubaix in 1896, popularized Styria bicycles which were even exported to England and France. By 1895, Puch already employed more than 300 workers producing about 6000 bikes a year. In 1897 Puch left the company after a dispute with his business partners. Two years later he founded the First Styrian Bicycle Factory AG (Erste Steiermärkische Fahrradfabrik AG) in Graz. Puch's company became successful through innovation and quality handicraft, rapidly expanding over time. It soon began producing motorcycles and mopeds. The main production plant, later called Einser-Werk, was constructed in the south of Graz, in the district of Puntigam. Production of engines was started in 1901 and cars followed in 1904. In 1906 the production of the two-cylinder Puch Voiturette began and in 1909 a Puch car broke the world high-speed record with 130.4 km/h. In 1910, Puch is known to have produced sedans for members of the Habsburg imperial family. In 1912 Johann Puch went into retirement and became the company's honorary president. In that year the company employed about 1,100 workers and produced 16,000 bicycles and over 300 motorcycles and cars annually. Puch automobiles were successful at the pre-war Österreichische Alpenfahrt rally and from 1913, the four-cylinder 38 PS (horsepower) Type VIII Alpenwagen was manufactured in Graz. During World War I, Puch became an important vehicle supplier to the Austro-Hungarian Army. The Puch green and white chequered badge is in the colours of the Steyr town flag and is very similar in concept to the BMW badge, which is in the colours of the Bavarian flag. ===Between wars=== Puch XII Alpenwagen in Sweden, 1924/25 Puch 250 R, built 1935 Motorcycle Puch 500 VL with sidecar Felber, built 1937 With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire following the War, the market for automobiles shrank and production was discontinued. However, again in 1919, the new Type XII Alpenwagen was developed. In 1923 the Italian engineer and FIAT agent Giovanni Marcellino is said to have been sent by the banks to wind up the Puch factory in Graz. Instead of which, within a few weeks he had settled down to live in the town, designing and then producing a new version of the split-single. Taking his inspiration from industrial counter-piston engines, the new engine benefited from the improved breathing of the Italian original, to which he added asymmetric port timing.Puch's two-stroke double- piston engines (archive) asymmetric port opening of 1923 Puch Marcellino design, inspired by industrial counter-piston engines. In 1931 Puch won the German Grand Prix with a supercharged split-single, though in subsequent years the split-singles of DKW did better. In 1928 the company merged with Austro- Daimler into the new Austro-Daimler-Puchwerke. This company in its turn merged in 1934 with Steyr-Werke AG to form the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate. ===WWII=== Like all enterprises of its kind, the Puch production plants had to change to arms production during World War II. The existing capacity was insufficient, therefore a second plant was constructed and opened in 1941 in Thondorf, Graz. In the three original assembly halls, luxury vehicles for the American market were produced. Steyr-Daimler-Puch is one of the companies known to have benefited from slave labor housed in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp system during World War II. Slaves from the camp were used in a highly profitable system used by 45 engineering and war-effort companies, and amongst them Puch had an underground factory built at Gusen in 1943. ===Post-War years=== Steyr-Puch Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle, 1970-1999 During the period immediately after the war, late 1945 to 1947, the factory was requisitioned and run by the British Army (R.E.M.E.) who used the facilities and what remained of the workforce for the repairing and servicing of British and American military vehicles. In 1949, an assembly cooperation agreement was signed with Fiat in Turin. The 1950s to the mid-1970s saw a sharp increase in production of motorcycles, bicycles and mopeds. Even though Puch was a part of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, it still manufactured products under its own name, as well as for Steyr-Puch and other companies. Puch gave up racing in the 1950s and split-single production ended around 1970. * 1953: Puch launched two new motorcycles, the 125 and 175 SV. * 1954: The very successful MS 50 moped was launched. * 1957: The Puch 500 small car came on the market. * 1958: Production of the Steyr-Puch Haflingers started. 16,657 vehicles are produced in total and exported into 110 countries. * 1966: Sobiesław Zasada wins the European Rally Championship on a 650 TR II. * 1969: The most successful Puch product is launched, Puch Maxi moped, 1.8 million of which are built. * 1970: The cross-country Steyr-Puch vehicle Pinzgauer was launched - production continued until 1999 with over 24,000 built. * 1973: Production of the Fiat 126 with a Puch engine commenced. * 1975: Harry Everts wins the 1975 250 cc motocross world championship for Puch. * 1978: Record- setting year, seeing the production of over 270,000 mopeds and motorcycles as well as 350,000 bicycles. * 1979: A joint-venture with Mercedes-Benz saw Puch building the Mercedes-Benz G-Class in Graz. * 1981: Puch has Speed Unlimited of Wayne, NJ manufacture a BMX line called the Puch Trak Pro. * 1983: A joint- venture with Volkswagen saw the Volkswagen Type 2 (T3)'s engine being built in Graz. *1983: A joint-venture with Fiat, where Puch designed and built the four-wheel drive mechanics for the Fiat Panda 4x4 Mk1. ==VehiclesPuch scooters=== The late 1950s saw strong sales of the Puch 125cc two-stroke single motorscooters, which had three gears shifted from the left twistgrip. These machines developed a reputation for reliability and were popular for daily commuting, providing good weather protection and ease of use. In this role their moderate performance, with a top speed of around 45 mph, was not a problem. Later models had a 150cc engine and foot-operation, giving better performance of 6 hp instead of 5 hp but retaining the three gears. ===Puch mopeds=== Puch MS50 Moped Puch produced the Puch Maxi, Puch Newport, and MK mopeds, which were popular from the late 1970s to early 1980s. In Austria and the Netherlands, Puch mopeds played a big role in the 1960s popular culture. Puch mopeds in Sweden were, and still are, very popular despite the company ceasing production of mopeds in 1985. They were all named after US states, except the Maxi and the Monza. Some of the more popular models were: * VS50 50 cc 2-speed gearbox * The Dakota (VZ 50) 50 cc fan-cooled, 3-speed gearbox. In fact, the most popular by far. * The Florida (MV 50) 50 cc fan-cooled, 3-speed gearbox * The Alabama (DS 50) 50 cc fan-cooled, 3- or 4-speed gearbox The oldest mopeds often had a 50 cc fan-cooled engine with a 1- or 2-speeded gearbox (cric-crac) and newer mopeds had many different, (always 50cc), engines such as: *Fan-cooled, 3-speed (Dakota, Dakota 3000, Nevada) *Fan- cooled, 4-speed (Mexico) *Air-cooled, 3-speed (Arizona, Monza M50, Montana, Monza 3C) *Air-cooled, 4-speed (Monza 4speed) ===Puch BMX=== Puch began making BMX bikes as early as the 1970s. Many different models appeared including the Challenger, Invader and Trak Pro. A short-lived BMX style moped, the Maxi BMX Special was produced in the mid-70s however proved unpopular. Compared to the company's more successful models very few unmolested examples remain. In 1981 they worked with Speed Unlimited in Wayne, New Jersey to manufacture a line of high end BMX race bikes. Speed Unlimited also made bikes for Hutch and their own brand Thruster. The model they made for Puch was the Trak Pro. In 1981 Puch also began sponsoring BMX racers across the United States. The green, black and white uniform was soon showing up at BMX tracks across America, especially in the Northeast. There is a collection of Puchs at the BMX Museum - Puch Collection. ===Puch Maxi=== Puch Maxi S Moped The Maxi is one of Puch's most well known machines along with the Magnum and Newport models. The Puch Maxi is a moped fitted with a single cylinder, 50cc, two stroke engine . The engine produced around 2 hp and could propel the rider at speeds of 28 mph (48 km/h). It was started using the pedals which could be engaged and disengaged from the engine via a starting lever so it could be ridden as a normal bicycle. Later models did not have pedals, and instead were started with a kick start mechanism. ===Puch motorcycle marketed as the \\"Twingle\\"=== Puch motorcycle 250 SGSPuch is remembered in the US for importing the SGS 250, the first and last split-single seen there. Marketed by Sears in their catalogue as the \\"Twingle\\",\\"Allstate 250\\" 1966 from Sears. Note that \\"front\\" and \\"rear\\" pistons are labelled in reverse in this diagram. it was styled much like a BMW of the 1950s and 60s. The layout had been popular in Europe between the wars because it improved scavenging, and hence fuel consumption, a feature considered less important in the US. New models after World War II had an internal re-arrangement which improved piston lubrication, reducing wear on the most vulnerable part of the engine, while an early system of pumping the two-stroke oil, along with the twin spark-plug ignition, greatly improved day- to-day reliability. Despite the racing heritage and performance potential of the split-single engine, this particular Puch model, with a top speed around , was at a disadvantage against the loop-scavenged two-strokes that arrived in the late 1960s. A total of 38,584 of Puch 250 SGS motorcycles were produced between 1953 and 1970.Friedrich F. Ehn: Das große Puch-Buch. Weishaupt, Graz 1993, (German) ===Puch 500=== Steyr-Puch 500 The Puch 500 was a city car produced by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Graz under license from Fiat. Based on the Fiat 500, it was manufactured from 1957 until 1975. ==Foreign ventures== In 1970 Puch bought a 50% share of Spanish motorcycle and scooter manufacturer Avello located in the city of Gijón in Asturias, in northern Spain. During the following years that plant manufactured models with Puch motors and original frames and later built Puch models. Over the years, in spite of good sales, the Spanish venture was losing money and in 1983 Suzuki bought 36% from the Spanish owners so the Spanish venture became a Puch-Suzuki venture. In 1988 Suzuki bought all outstanding shares and became sole owner of the Spanish manufacturer. ==Legacy== A Puch bicycle head badge. In the late 1980s, the company was being squeezed out by competition. In 1987, a massive restructuring of the company led to the end of the production of two-wheelers in Graz. The company's technical know-how was always better than its marketing and commercial success. The Puch motorcycle company was sold to Piaggio, maker of the Vespa, in 1987 and still produces bikes under the name Puch. When the bicycle division of Piaggio, which also included Bianchi Bicycles was sold to the Swedish Grimaldi Industri group in 1997, Puch became part of Cycleurope. In 2011, Austrian entrepreneur Josef Faber took control of the brand, with the 2012 line of bicycles manufactured by Cycleurope in France. Steyr-Puch, assembler of four wheel drive vehicles and parts, still exists next to the Piaggio division. The so-called \\"Einserwerk\\", the first production plant, shut down in the early 2000s. The historical assembly-hall was declared a protected industrial monument. When Graz became European Capital of Culture in 2003, a Puch museum was opened in one of the former assembly halls. Puch sold the entire production line of Puch Maxi Plus to Hero Motors when production ended in Austria. It spawned the Hero Puch that sold extremely well in India from 1988 until the end of 2003 when production ended. ==See also== * Zündapp Bella * Maicoletta ==NotesPuch bikes * Johann-Puch-Museum in Graz * My Austro-Daimler Vent Noir II History of Steyr-Daimler-Puch with emphasis on bicycle production, and refurbishment of an AD bicycle Category:Car manufacturers of Austria Category:Moped manufacturers Category:Motorcycle manufacturers of Austria Category:Scooter manufacturers Category:Austrian brands Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1899 Category:1899 establishments in Austria-Hungary Category:Cycle manufacturers of Austria Category:Companies based in Graz ","title":"Puch"},{"id":"515517","text":"Aneto's summit and glacier seen from the upper Portillon Mountaineer 0n the last stretch to Aneto' summit, Mohammed's Pass Aneto (Pic de Néthou in FrenchSpanish Nature: Aneto.) is the highest mountain in the Pyrenees and in Aragon, and Spain's third-highest mountain,Following 3,718 m high Teide on the Canary Island of Tenerife and 3,479 m high Mulhacén in the Sierra Nevada. reaching a height of .

Its northern side holds the largest glacier in the Pyrenees, covering in 2005; it is shrinking rapidly due to warming summer temperatures and decreasing winter precipitations over the 20th century – it covered 106.7 ha in 1981, and over 200 ha in the 19th century.Boletín Glaciológico Aragonés, 2004. It is estimated that it has lost more than half of its surface in the last 100 years, and that it may disappear around 2050. ==Toponym== Initially, the mountain did not even have a name. There are indications that the shepherds and hunters from the southern valleys referred to it as Malheta or Malahita or Punta. The first cultured traveller who saw it from the port (or pass) of Benasque, Louis Ramond de Carbonnières, simply described its appearance as \\"needles of ice\\" in 1787.. The highest point of the Pyrenees eventually inherited the name of a village on its south-eastern side: Aneto. The French, on hearing the Argonese pronunciation of \\"Aneto\\", retained the last two clearly accentuated phonetic syllables, \\"ne\\" and \\"tu\\", ignoring the first syllable \\"a\\". Based on such oral transcription, the French name \\"Netou\\" came to exist along with several historical variants: Nelto, Nettou, Anetthou, Annetton, Anelthou, Nethom or Aréthon, all used by various cartographers. Even though the summit and slopes are entirely within Spanish territory, the first extensive studies of the Pyrenees - and the only ones for the following 100 years - were French ones from the 19th century - starting with the very detailed study by Jean Daniel François Schrader (1844-1924) in 1874. So these names were the toponyms that were then used. It took Émile Belloc's renown work on the Pyrenees (notably on its hydrology, glaciology and etymology) to establish the name of Aneto as the official toponym; he consistently used that name in 1898 already. ==History== Some 2km away on its north-west fringe lies the Maladeta peak that, though not being among the five highest peaks in the environment, gave its name to the entire massif.Maladeta Massif on summitpost.org. It subsequently earned the greatest interest of climbers, especially in the early 18th century. Mainly, it was a matter of perspective, since from the natural entrance to the valley or arriving from France, its top is in the foreground, while the crest hides the true extent of its eastern neighbor, taller and with larger glaciers. Only when Friedrich von Parrot reached the top of the Maladeta in 1817, came the realisation that both Aneto as well as its neighbours the Pico del Medio, the Punta Astorg, the Pico Maldito and la Aguja Schmidt Endell towered higher. Until then, the Monte Perdido had been considered the highest. However, the uncovering of the highest point of the Pyrenees had hardly been accomplished when the mountain began to earn a reputation, as several glacial disasters, some fatal, dissipated the interest in crowning it - notably with the death of Luchon Barrau, considered the dean and leading expert in the area. He fell in a crack in the ice on Maladeta. This caused a real shock and the natives, already very fearful of venturing on the glacier, became genuinely scared of the mountain which they considered cursed. ==Geography== Map of Aneto and the valleys and massifs that surround it. Aneto rises to above sea level in the centre of the Pyrenees mountain range. It lies entirely in Spain, just south of the main ridge of the Pyrenees and the border between France and Spain.. The peak lies in the north-east of the province of Huesca above the town of Benasque, Aneto occupies the eastern end of the Malditos Massif which primarily consists of a 6km long ridge, running from north-west to south east at over 3000m. The ridge connects Aneto towards the east with the more visible Maladeta peak, further to the west, and includes the Coronas peaks and Pico Maldito, which, together with the crest of the portillons, gives the massif its characteristic image. Photo of the Maladeta massif with names of its peaks. Although the valley to the north is the source of the Ésera river, which flows west and then south, the northern slopes of Aneto and its glacier drain into a sinkhole in the Plan de Aigualluts and flow underground to the east where they resurface to empty into the Aran Valley and the Garonne river, flowing north into France and the Atlantic Ocean. The waters of the western and southern sides, flow into the Coronas and Llosas lakes respectively before draining separately into the river Ballibierna, which flows into the Esera, then the Cinca before joining the Ebro and flowing to the Mediterranean. Thus although Aneto does not lie on the main ridge of the Pyrenees, it does lie on the watershed between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. ==Glaciers== This agglomeration of summits, all markedly Alpine, is the birthplace of what were once the largest glaciers in the Pyrenees, which stretched up to the mouth of the Congosto Ventamillo with depths of ice several hundred metres thick. Today, global warming has reduced the portentous mass to eleven glaciers that total only three hundred acres. No one knows for sure when the melting process began but despite a slight advance in the '50s it has now accelerated rapidly, and it is expected that the Aneto permafrost and the glaciers of the Pyrenees could disappear around the middle of the 21st century. The Aneto-Maladeta massif sustains a total of 286 acres' surface, representing more than half of all the glaciers in Spain - all of which being located in the Pyrenees. There are three glaciers on the slopes of the mountain: the oldest, Aneto glacier on the north side; the Barrancos, alongside the Las Tempestades on the north-east side; and the Coronas or Coronado glacier on the south side. The rest cannot truly be defined as glaciers without contention, as they have lost all mobility and do not behave as such. Among these are the Cregüella, Alba and Salenques glaciers, which are in a major state of decline. However, even considering them as snowfields, their past glacier state has kept them to date and they are expected to maintain their icy heart for decades. ==Climbing== The mountain's ascent is usually made from the Renclusa Refuge (2,140 m). From there, the itinerary traverses the longest part of the glacier that extends to the north of the peak. The summit is defended by a short rocky passage called the Bridge of Mohammed. It is a narrow ridge of large, stable blocks, with an exposed drop on either side. At the summit is an impressive cross and a contrasting view, with the snow-covered Maladeta massif north-west and the Alto Aragon region to the south. The usual ascent is a very easy although long (12-hour) alpine route. It is taken by many people each year, including many with little or no experience of alpine climbing or high level walking. The high number of people who come to climb Aneto each year makes a significant contribution to the local economy. The vast majority of the people staying at the Renclusa Refuge are there solely to climb Aneto. By comparison many of the adjacent peaks, which are arguably finer climbs, see relatively few ascents and are comparatively quiet. ===First ascent=== On 18 July 1842, Platon de Tchihatcheff (Чихачёв, Chikhachev), a former Russian officer vacationing in Luchon, left from Bagnères-de-Luchon accompanied by guides Pierre Sanio de Luz, Luchonnais Bernard Arrazau and Pierre Redonnet. Also in the party were Albert de Franqueville, a Norman botanist, and his guide, Jean Sors. They took the trail from the Hospice de France, crossed the Benasque Pass, then spent the night at the La Renclusa shelter, a simple construction of dry rocks that is now a large mountain refuge. The next day, they crossed a pass towards Alba pass and lost their way on the south slope around Lake Gregueña. Late in the day, at the end of their strength, they took refuge for the night in a cabin near the Vallibierna valley. As the sun rose the next morning, the group left for the Coroné pass. Despite a fear of crevasses, they decided to approach the summit by the glacier. After climbing a ridge only a few metres wide (named the \\"Bridge of Muhammad\\" by Albert de Franqueville as it is believed, according to a Muslim legend that says that the entrance to Paradise is as narrow as the blade of a scimitar on which only the righteous pass), they reached the summit on 20 July 1842, where they constructed a cairn and left a bottle containing each climber's name. Tchihatcheff wanted to open a more direct route back across the glacier, but his companions flatly refused, forcing him to yield. Four days later he performed a second ascent with another group, pursuing the same objective that his first companions had denied him. On crossing the Portillon, in view of the cracks that furrowed the glacier, a mutiny almost started, but finally, after everyone tied themselves to a big rope, they crossed the chasms and the passage of Muhammad was defeated a second time. Thereafter Aneto entered into the dynamics of dissemination and popularization of the Pyrenees peaks. In France, its ascension became a great classic and every spring tourist to Bagneres de Luchon had to try it. Henry Spont wrote a book reflecting on this experience, simply titled Le Néthou, describing the trip, the schedule and recommended equipment. ===First winter ascent=== The first winter ascent of the mountain was achieved on 1 March 1878 by Roger de Monts, B. Courrèges, and B. and V. Paget. ===First sea to summit ascent=== Starting from the Atlantic ocean, unresupplied and unsupported, Louis-Philippe Loncke reached the summit on day 25 of his crossing of the Pyrenees (August 19, 2020).. ==Flora== Pine forest at the foot of the massif of Maladeta. The uniqueness of the massif and its appeal has led to the virtual abandonment of farming activities, replaced by tourism. The flora of the environment, therefore, has been impeccably conserved, especially on hillsides and massifs, where the forests remain in their primary state. === Upper Alpine === This layer, which reaches 3,404 metres above sea level, is the one that presents greatest difficulties for the development of life. The harsh weather conditions that the plants have to endure at the top of the peaks, ridges and crests, require the development of an extraordinary resilience. There are a number of factors to endure such as strong insolation, low temperatures and short growing seasons in the presence of snow most of the year. Totally devoid of woody vegetation, it is colonized by more than 100 plant species, including lichens, mosses, succulents and microscopic algae. Among the flora present are the Androsace Vandelli, which is found at 2,800 metres, and the Silene acaulis. Eduardo Viñuales, Guía Total: Pirineo Aragonés, editions Anaya, 1st édition, April 2001, Madrid, . . 20% of these species are endemic to the Pyrenees. ==Air traffic boundary== An aviation intersection called ANETO exists very close to the mountain itself, exactly on the border of France and Spain. For pilots crossing the Pyrenees this intersection marks the boundary between the Bordeaux and Barcelona airspaces. ==See also== Aneto Peak (3404m) summit panorama, looking South West, Pyrenees range *List of Pyrenean three-thousanders ==References== ==External links== * Info on Climbing Aneto *Information on the glaciers of the Aneto-Maladeta area Category:Mountains of Aragon Category:Mountains of the Pyrenees Category:Pyrenean three-thousanders ","title":"Aneto"},{"id":"515529","text":"Shoreham may refer to: ==Places== * Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, UK ** Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency) 1974-1997 ** New Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency) 1295-1885 ** Shoreham Airport, West Sussex, UK ** Shoreham F.C., an association football club ** Shoreham-by-Sea railway station, West Sussex, UK * Shoreham, Kent, UK ** Shoreham railway station, Kent, UK * Shoreham, Michigan, US * Shoreham, New York, US * Shoreham, Vermont, US * Shoreham, Victoria, Australia * Port Shoreham, Nova Scotia, Canada ==Other== * Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, New York, US * HMS Shoreham * Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C., US ==See also== * New Shoreham (disambiguation) ","title":"Shoreham"},{"id":"515531","text":"Prince Maria Emanuel of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen (31 January 1926 – 23 July 2012) was the head of the Royal House of Saxony.Adam Bilinski.

After escaping his sentence he next had to escape from the approaching Soviets as his homeland Saxony became a part of communist East Germany as World War II wound down.

Maria Emanuel became head of the Royal House of Saxony upon the death of his father on 9 August 1968. ==Succession== As Maria Emanuel fathered no legitimate children, he had acknowledged as his eventual heir Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe, the son of his eldest sister Princess Anna and her late husband Prince Robert of Gessaphe (or \\"Assaphe\\"/\\"Afif-Assaf\\", descendants of a Lebanese Christian family which ruled a province north of Beirut).de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. Le Petit Gotha. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery, Paris 2002, p. 127 (French) Maria Emanuel adopted Alexander on 1 June 1999, who had married Princess Gisela of Bavaria in 1987. In 1997 the surviving male dynasts of the Albertine line of Wettins consented to the Margrave's decision, Subsequently, his brother Albert stated that he no longer accepted the decision. The royal line of the House of Wettin applies semi-salic law, which allows for inheritance through a female. Since the death of Maria Emanuel, if Albert was the last male dynast then this would lead firstly to the children of their sisters Maria Josepha (unmarried), Maria Anna and Mathilde, but only Mathilde's marriage indisputedly met equality requirements and her only son died in 1987. Therefore, if the Gessaphe claim is invalid, the succession would pass to the issue of the Margrave's paternal aunts, who were Margarete Karola (1900–1962), Maria Alix (1901–1990) and Anna (1903–1976), all of whom left children. Margarete having been the eldest, the heir would be her grandson Karl Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern (born 1932), head of the princely line of the royal House of Hohenzollern. The Margrave's brother Albert, however, supported discarding equality requirements to allow his cousin Prince Timo of Saxony's morganatic son, Rüdiger (born 1953), to eventually succeed. Rüdiger has, with his first wife Astrid Linke (1949–1989), three sons Daniel (born 1975), Arne (born 1977) and Nils (born 1978). Although the Albertine Saxons consist only of the royal branch, there are several extant lines of the House of Wettin which ruled the various Ernestine duchies until 1918 (as well as the cadet branches of the Coburg line which held several royal crowns). In a joint statement of 23 June 2015, the heads of the three remaining branches of the senior Ernestine line of the House of Wettin, Michael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Konrad, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, declared that, according to the house law of the House of Wettin and to traditional princely succession rules, Alexander Afif, bearing the name Prince of Saxony by adoption, were neither a member of nobility nor of the House of Wettin, nor had he succeeded Maria Emanuel as head of the Albertine branch (the Royal House of Saxony), nor were he entitled to style himself Margrave of Meissen.Joint Statement by the heads of the House of Wettin of 23 June 2015 ==Titles, styles and honoursTitles and styles=== *31 January 1926 – 9 August 1968: His Royal Highness Prince Maria Emanuel of Saxony, Duke of Saxony *9 August 1968 – 23 July 2012: His Royal Highness The Margrave of Meissen ===Honours=== * House of Wettin: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Rue Crown * House of Wettin: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Military Order of St. Henry * House of Wettin: Sovereign of the Order of Sidonia * House of Wettin: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Albert, Special Class * House of Wettin: Sovereign of the Order of Maria-Anna * House of Wettin: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Saxony * Ducal Family of Anhalt: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Albert the Bear * Princely Family of Hohenzollern: Knight Grand Cross of the House Order of Hohenzollern * Princely Family of Thurn and Taxis: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Parfaite Amitié * Austrian Imperial and Royal Family: 1, 300th Knight with Collar of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece ==Ancestry== ==References== ==External links== * House Laws of the Kingdom of Saxony * Website of his brother Prince Albert of Saxony *Website of the House of Wettin Category:Margraves of Meissen Category:1926 births Category:2012 deaths Category:House of Wettin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Rue Crown Category:Recipients of the Military Order of St. Henry Category:Grand Crosses of the Military Order of St. Henry Category:Recipients of the Albert Order Category:Grand Crosses of the Albert Order Category:Recipients of the Order of Albert the Bear Category:Recipients of the House Order of Hohenzollern Category:Grand Commanders of the House Order of Hohenzollern Category:Knights of the Order of Parfaite Amitié Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:Saxon princes Category:People from Regensburg Category:German Roman Catholics Category:Albertine branch ","title":"Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen"},{"id":"515534","text":"Injury, also known as physical trauma, is damage to the body caused by external force. This may be caused by accidents, falls, hits, weapons, and other causes. Major trauma is injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. In 2013, 4.8 million people world-wide died from injuries, up from 4.3 million in 1990. More than 30% of these deaths were transport-related injuries. In 2013, 367,000 children under the age of five died from injuries, down from 766,000 in 1990. Injuries are the cause of 9% of all deaths, and are the sixth-leading cause of death in the world. == Classification == Deaths from injuries per million persons in 2012 Deaths from intentional injuries per million persons in 2012 The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are classified by: * mechanism of injury; * objects/substances producing injury; * place of occurrence; * activity when injured; * the role of human intent; and additional modules. These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on causes and preventive efforts.Robertson, LS (2015) Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition. Free online at www.nanlee.net The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are classified by * nature, * part of body affected, * source and secondary source, and * event or exposure. The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated several times since. The Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) is used to classify injuries to enable research into specific sports injuries. === By cause === * Causes for injuries fall under two categories: intentional and accidental. Intentional injuries include acts of violence and war, or be self-imposed like suicide or self-harm. Accidental injuries can come from falling or motor vehicle accidents. Some cases of accidental injuries are injury by stingray or lightning injuries. === By modality === * Trauma ** Traumatic injuries are a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical collision or movement. Injuries associated with trauma are avulsion, bone fracture, injury by blast, internal bleeding and catastrophic injuries. * Strain, repetitive strain, or sprain ** Strain and repetitive strain are injuries to muscles or tendons. Sprain is an injury to a ligament or ligaments. * Toxins ** Injury from toxin or as adverse effect of a pharmaceutical drug. * Other external or internal injuries ** Other injuries can be from external causes, such as radiation, burn or frostbite. These injuries can include radiation-induced lung injury and microwave burn. Injuries from internal causes include reperfusion injury. === By location === Skin: * Wound, an injury in which skin is torn, cut or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a closed wound).

It is located along the east bluffs above the Grand River. According to the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), it is the site where Adam and Eve lived after being expelled from the Garden of Eden. It teaches that the place will be a gathering spot for a meeting of the priesthood leadership, including prophets of all ages and other righteous people, prior to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The Latter Day Saints once proposed building a temple on the site. Such efforts were halted in the 19th century as a result of the 1838 Mormon War to evict the Latter Day Saints from Missouri. Their having declared Adam-ondi-Ahman as a sacred site for a temple was a flash point in that confrontation. After the Latter Day Saints were evicted, residents renamed the site Cravensville. It was the site of a skirmish during the American Civil War on August 4, 1862, when Union troops attempted to stop Confederate reinforcements in the First Battle of Independence. Six Confederates were killed and 10 wounded. The Union forces had five wounded. Today, most of the site is owned by the LDS Church and is used predominantly as farmland. ==History== Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman (the Grand River valley) Panorama of Adam-ondi-Ahman In the 1830s, Latter Day Saints who were being forced out of Jackson County, Missouri, settled just south of Daviess County in Caldwell County, in the settlement of Far West. In February 1838, Lyman Wight built a home and established a ferry on the Grand River at a spot known as \\"Wight's Ferry.\\" That spring, Joseph Smith visited the site. He proclaimed there were either two or three (depending on subsequent interpretations) altars built by Adam at the site. One altar Smith called the \\"altar of prayer\\"; it was located by Wight's house on Tower Hill. It was described as \\"sixteen feet long, by nine or ten feet wide, having its greatest extent north and south. The height of the altar at each end was some two and a half feet, gradually rising higher to the center, which was between four and five feet high—the whole surface being crowning.\\" The other altar—called the \\"altar of sacrifice\\"—was said to be a mile to the north on top of Spring Hill.The two altar-concept was promoted by Alvin R. Dyer who has written much of the modern history of the site. But, the three-altar arrangement was recorded by Heber C. Kimball who wrote : \\"The Prophet Joseph called upon Brother Brigham, myself and others, saying, ‘Brethren, come, go along with me, and I will show you something.’ He led us a short distance to a place where were the ruins of three altars built of stone, one above the other, and one standing a little back of the other, like unto the pulpits in the Kirtland Temple, representing the order of three grades of Priesthood; ‘There,’ said Joseph, ‘is the place where Adam offered up sacrifice after he was cast out of the garden.’ The altar stood at the highest point of the bluff. I went and examined the place several times while I remained there.\\" On May 19, 1838, Smith formally revealed his belief that Adam-ondi-Ahman was the place where Adam and Eve went after being exiled from the Garden of Eden. compiled by Bruce Satterfield, BYU-Idaho Professor of Religion On June 25, 1838, at a conference in Wight's orchard, a Latter Day Saint settlement at Adam-ondi-Ahman was formally established. Within a few months, its population grew to 1500. Non-Mormon settlers grew worried that the Latter Day Saints would seize political control of Daviess County. On August 6, 1838, a group of non-Mormons tried to prevent Latter Day Saint settlers from voting in the local elections at Gallatin. The Mormons fought back and defeated the mob in a skirmish that came to be known as the Gallatin Election Day Battle. This was the opening skirmish in the Mormon War. In the course of the conflict, non-Mormon vigilantes from neighboring counties came to Daviess and burned Latter Day Saint homes. Latter Day Saint refugees gathered at Adam-ondi-Ahman for protection. Latter Day Saints responded to the attacks by leading their own forces from Caldwell County. Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44, in which he called out 2500 militiamen and threatened to \\"exterminate\\" the Mormon community. In October 1838, Smith, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and other Latter Day Saint leaders gathered to dedicate the temple square on the highest point on the bluff. Smith, Wight and others surrendered on November 1, 1838, on charges of murder, arson, theft, rebellion, and treason. After a preliminary court hearing was held November 12 to 29 in Richmond, Smith and Wight were transferred to the jail in Liberty. On November 7, 1838, the Latter Day Saints were told they had ten days to abandon the settlement. They moved to Far West, Missouri. On April 9, 1839, Smith was sent to the Daviess County Jail in Gallatin for a hearing, where a grand jury indicted him. On April 15, following the granting of a change of venue, Smith was permitted by his guards to escape while en route to Boone County, Missouri, a day after getting supplies at Adam-ondi-Ahman. Most of the Latter Day Saints had left Missouri by early 1839. The refugees gathered in Illinois and later regrouped at the new Mormon center of Nauvoo. Although many Latter Day Saints were tried for their part in the war, no non-Mormon vigilantes were brought to trial. Because the Latter Day Saints held their lands in Adam-ondi-Ahman by preemption, all of their rights and improvements were lost when they were forced to leave. Their losses are recorded in a set of Mormon Redress Petitions collected and edited by Clark V. Johnson. Most of the land in Adam-ondi-Ahman was purchased by John Cravens, who renamed the town \\"Cravensville.\\" Today, 3000 acres (12 km²) of Adam-ondi-Ahman is owned and maintained as a historic site by the LDS Church and remains largely undeveloped farmland. ==Religious significance== Adam-ondi-Ahman is the subject of a revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded in the LDS Church edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, a book of scripture within the Latter Day Saint movement: \\"Spring Hill is named by the Lord Adam-ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet.\\" (LDS Church edition). The naming of Adam-ondi-Ahman is also recorded in the History of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in volume 2, chapter 9, pages 153–54. Contemporaries of Smith stated that he taught that the Garden of Eden was located in the vicinity of Independence, Missouri,Bruce A. Van Orden, “I Have a Question: What do we know about the location of the Garden of Eden?”, Ensign, January 1994, pp. 54–55; see also Andrew Jenson, Historical Record, 7:438–39 (1888); Orson F.

McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, pp. 19-20 and that after Adam and Eve were banished from the garden, they went to Adam-ondi-Ahman.Adam-ondi- Ahman According to a revelation declared by Smith, Adam met his children at the site three years before his death to bestow his blessing. (LDS Church edition) LDS Church leader Joseph Fielding Smith has written that before the Second Coming, Adam will convene another meeting there to turn the government of the human family officially to Jesus Christ.Doctrines of Salvation, 3:13. ===Meaning of the name=== According to the belief of some Latter Day Saints, the term \\"Adam-ondi-Ahman\\" is part of the Adamic language.See, e.g., Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses 2:342. The name was first referenced in about 1832, in a revelation to Joseph Smith prior to being attached to a specific place. The name was also the title of a hymn that was popular in the early church. \\"Adam-ondi-Ahman\\" has been speculatively translated as the \\"Valley of God, where Adam dwelt\\" (by Latter Day Saint apostle Orson Pratt),Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol. 1, which cites Journal of Discourses 18:343. \\"the valley of God in which Adam blessed his children\\" (by John Corrill),Roberts, B.

A sign is anything that communicates a meaning, that is not the sign itself, to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste. The term was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of sign relations, or semiotics. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913). ==Overview== Peirce was interested primarily in logic, while Saussure was interested primarily in linguistics, which examines the functions and structures of language. However, both of them recognized that there is more to significant representation than language in the narrow sense of speech and writing alone. With this in mind, they developed the idea of semiosis to relate language to other sign systems both human and nonhuman. Today, there is disagreement as to the operating cause and effect. One school of thought argues that language is the semiotic prototype and its study illuminates principles that can be applied to other sign systems. The opposing school argues that there is a metasign system and that language is simply one of many codes for communicating meaning, citing the way in which human infants learn about their environment before they have acquired verbal language. Whichever may be right, a preliminary definition of semiosis is any action or influence for communicating meaning by establishing relationships between signs which are to be interpreted by an audience. ==Discussion== Semiosis is the performance element involving signs. Although a human can communicate many things unintentionally, individuals usually speak or write to elicit some kind of response. Yet there is little real explanation of how semiosis produces its effects, which is odd given that the word \\"sign\\" is in everyday use and most people would understand what it means. But semiotics has not offered clear technical definitions, nor is there agreement about how signs should be classified. As an insect (or any animal, human or otherwise) moves through its environment (sometimes termed the umwelt), all the senses collect data that are made available to the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only salient data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a model of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background noise. When this happens, the sign then triggers cognitive activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the semiosphere, the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle: *The plant, insect, or animal with the need to communicate (e.g., to recognise an object of food) will know what needs to be said and assess the best means of saying it (e.g., starting a searching behaviour); *This information will then be encoded and relevant muscle groups will effect transmission — although to some extent intentional in the human, the actual movements of the body are autonomic, i.e. the individual is not aware of moving individual muscles, but achieves the desired result by an act of will (see H. L. A. Hart on the nature of an action); *The audience filters ambient data and perceives the uttered code as a grouping of signs; *The audience then interprets the signs (sometimes termed decoding) to attribute meaning. This involves matching the signs received against existing patterns and their meanings held in memory (i.e. it is learned and understood within the community). In plants, insects and animals, the results of a successful interpretation will be an observable response to the stimuli perceived. In biology, scout bees and ants will return home to tell the others where food is to be found, the fact of fertility must be announced to prospective mates from the same species, and the presence of danger must be passed as a warning to others in the group. Such transmission may be chemical, auditory, visual, or tactile whether singly or in combination. There is a new field of research activity termed biosemiotics, and Jesper Hoffmeyer claims that endosymbiosis, self-reference, code duality, the availability of receptors, autopoiesis, and others are the general properties of all living systems. Thomas Sebeok suggests that a similar list of properties for life may coincide with the definition of semiosis, i.e. that the test of whether something is alive, is a test to determine whether and how it communicates meaning to another of its kind, i.e., whether it has semiosis. This has been called the Sebeok's Thesis. For humans, semiosis is an aspect of the wider systems of social interaction in which information is exchanged. It can result in particular types of social encounter, but the process itself can be constrained by social conventions such as propriety, privacy, and disclosure. This means that no social encounter is reducible to semiosis alone, and that semiosis can only be understood by identifying and exploring all the conditions that make the transmission and reception of signs possible and effective. When two individuals meet, the ways in which they think, the specific identities they assume, the emotional responses they make, and the beliefs, motives, and purposes they have, will frame the situation as it develops dynamically and potentially test the legitimacy of the outcomes. All these elements are, to a greater or lesser extent, semiotic in nature in that prevailing codes and values are being applied. Consequently, where the line is drawn between semiosis and semiotics will always be somewhat arbitrary. ==See also== *Index of semiotic terms ==References== *Bains, Paul.

Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman under wartime conditions (including at the Atlantic Charter). She was named after Augusta, Georgia, and was sponsored by Miss Evelyn McDaniel of that city. ==Construction== USS Houston is seen fitting out in the background. Augusta, a \\"Treaty\\" cruiser of 10,000 tons normal displacement, was laid down on 2 July 1928 at Newport News, Virginia, by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.; launched on 1 February 1930, sponsored by Evelyn McDaniel of Augusta, Georgia; and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 30 January 1931, Captain James O. Richardson in command. Originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-31, because of her thin armor. Effective 1 July 1931, Augusta was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-31, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. ==Service history== Damage to one of her turbines curtailed the ship's original shakedown cruise, but Augusta conducted abbreviated initial training during a cruise to Colón, Panama, and back, before she was assigned duty as flagship for Commander, Scouting Force, Vice Admiral Arthur L. Willard, on 21 May 1931. During the summer of 1931, she operated with the other warships of Scouting Force, carrying out tactical exercises off the New England coast. In September, Augusta moved south to Chesapeake Bay, where she joined her colleagues in their normal fall gunnery drills until mid-November, when the cruisers retired to their home ports. Augusta entered the Norfolk Navy Yard at that time. At the beginning of 1932 she and the other cruisers of the Scouting Force reassembled in Hampton Roads, whence they departed on 8 January on their way to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Augusta conducted training evolutions with the Scouting Force in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay until 18 February, when the force headed for the Panama Canal on its way to the eastern Pacific to participate in Fleet Problem XIII. She arrived in San Pedro, California, on 7 March but returned to sea three days later to execute the fleet problem. During the maneuvers Augusta and her colleagues in Scouting Force squared off against Battle Force in defense of three simulated \\"atolls\\" located at widely separated points on the West Coast. The exercises afforded the Fleet training in strategic scouting and an opportunity to practice defending and attacking a convoy. The Fleet Problem ended on 18 March, but Augusta and the rest of Scouting Force did not return to the Atlantic at its conclusion as was normal. In a gesture that presaged Roosevelt's retention of the Fleet at Pearl Harbor in 1940 after Fleet Problem XXI, the Hoover Administration kept the Fleet concentrated on the West Coast throughout 1932 in the unrealized hope that it might restrain Japanese aggression in China. In fact, Scouting Force was still on the West Coast almost a year later when the time came for Fleet Problem XIV in February 1933, and the Roosevelt Administration, which took office in March, proceeded to keep it there indefinitely. Consequently, Augusta continued to operate in the eastern Pacific until relieved of duty as Scouting Force's flagship late in October 1933. The cruiser left the Navy Yard, Puget Sound, Washington, and sailed for China on 20 October. ===Asiatic Fleet=== Steaming along the Northern Pacific \\"Great Circle\\" route from Seattle to Shanghai, Augusta moored in the Huangpu River, at Shanghai, on the morning of 9 November 1933. That afternoon, Admiral Frank B. Upham, Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet (CinCAF), broke his flag on board the newly arrived cruiser, and his old flagship, , sailed for the United States. Soon after she broke Admiral Upham's flag and Houston sailed for home, Augusta proceeded south from Shanghai in December 1933, and, over the next few months, operated in the Philippines, interspersing training with her yearly overhaul at Cavite and Olongapo. That spring, Augusta returned to China waters, \\"showing the flag\\", and then steamed to Yokohama, Japan, arriving there on 4 June 1934. At 07:30 the following morning, Admiral Upham left the ship to attend the state funeral ceremonies for the late Fleet Admiral Heihachiro Togo; Augusta commenced firing 19 one-minute guns in honor of the Japanese naval hero at 08:30. Departing Yokohama with Admiral Upham embarked on 11 June, the cruiser then visited Kobe (12 to 15 June) before she proceeded to Tsingtao, arriving there on 17 June, departing for Chinwangtao (Qinhuang Island) 10 September, departing for Chefoo 24 September, then departing for Shanghai 25 September, arriving 26 September. Augusta remained in Chinese waters, then departed Shanghai for Guam on 5 October 1934, under command of Captain Chester W. Nimitz, arriving there on the 10th. Sailing the next day, she proceeded to Australian waters for the first time, reaching Sydney on the 20th. Total complement at this time was 824: 64 officers and 760 enlisted. She remained there a week, while Admiral Upham visited the capital of Australia, Canberra, on 25 and 26 October. With CinCAF back on board on the 26th, Augusta cleared Sydney the following day for Melbourne, arriving there on 29 October. She remained there, observing the city's centenary ceremonies, until 13 November, when she sailed for Fremantle and Perth. On 20 November she sailed for the Dutch East Indies. Augusta reached Batavia (now Jakarta) on 25 November and remained there until 3 December, when she sailed for Bali, arriving at the port of Lauban Amok on 5 December. Underway again on the 8th, Augusta touched at Sandakan (14 to 16 December), Zamboanga (17 to 19 December), and Iloilo (20 to 21 December), before reaching Manila on the 22nd. The heavy cruiser remained in the Philippine Islands, receiving her usual yearly overhaul at Cavite and drydocking at Olongapo, in , before she re-embarked Admiral Upham and sailed for Hong Kong on 15 March 1935. Arriving on the 16th, Augusta remained there until the 25th, while CinCAF was embarked in for a trip to Canton (17 to 20 March 1935). (The cruiser's draft did not permit her to make the passage up the Pearl River to Canton.) Augusta got underway again on the 25th for Amoy (now Xiamen) and stayed there from 26 to 29 March, before she proceeded thence to Shanghai, arriving at that port city on the last day of March. Augusta remained at Shanghai until 30 April, when she sailed for her second visit to Japan, reaching Yokohama on 3 May 1935. The ship remained there for two weeks. Steaming thence to Kobe, and arriving there on 18 May for a week's sojourn, Augusta sailed for China on 25 May, and reached Nanking, the Chinese capital, on the 29th. The flagship remained at Nanking until 4 June, then sailed for Shanghai, arriving the following day. \\"Augie Maru\\", as her crew had affectionately nicknamed her, stayed at Shanghai until 27 June, and sailed for North China, reaching Tsingtao on the 29th. She remained there, carrying out exercises and gunnery practice, for the rest of the summer. Augusta departed Tsingtao on 30 September for Shanghai, arriving on 1 October, where, four days later, Admiral Orin G. Murfin relieved Admiral Upham as CinCAF. On 8 October, with the new CinCAF embarked, Augusta departed Shanghai for points south. Admiral Murfin transferred to Isabel to visit Bangkok (15 to 22 October), while he returned to the heavy cruiser to visit Singapore (24 to 30 October). Subsequently touching at Pontianak and Jesselton on Borneo, (31 October to 1 November and from 3 to 5 November respectively), \\"Augie Maru\\" visited the southern Philippine ports of Zamboanga (6 to 8 November) and Iloilo (9 to 10 November), before she returned to Manila on 11 November 1935. While Augusta underwent her annual overhaul at Cavite and Olongapo, Admiral Murfin flew his flag in Isabel from 14 December 1935 to 27 February 1936. Soon afterwards the heavy cruiser, again having CinCAF on board, sailed for the a succession of Philippine ports and places: Catbalogan, Cebu, Tacloban, Davao, Dumanquilas, Zamboanga, Tutu Bay, Jolo, and Tawi Tawi, before the ship returned to Manila on 29 March. On 31 March Augusta sailed to Hong Kong, arriving on 2 April, remaining there until the 11th. During this time, Admiral Murfin embarked in Isabel for the trip up the Pearl River to Canton (6 to 8 April), returning on the latter date to reembark in his flagship to resume his voyage up the China coast. Visiting Amoy on 12 and 13 April, Augusta then paused briefly at Woosung on 16 April before proceeding up the Yangtze, reaching Nanking on the following day. While Augusta navigated down the Yangtze to the Huangpu River, and Shanghai, Admiral Murfin continued up the Yangtze to Hankow (Wuhan) in Isabel, flew to Ichang (Yichang), then in to Crossing 22, and finally back to Hankow and Shanghai in Isabel, where he rejoined Augusta on 4 May. Augusta sailed for Japan on 21 May, for her third visit to that country, arriving at Yokohama on the 25th. The Asiatic Fleet flagship remained at that port until 5 June, when she sailed for Kobe, arriving there the following day. She remained in Japanese waters until 13 June, when she got underway for Tsingtao, arriving on the 16th. Augusta remained at Tsingtao, operating thence on exercises and training, for two months, then sailed for Chefoo, North China, on 17 August. Arriving the same day, she departed Chefoo on the 21st, and returned to Tsingtao, remaining there into mid-September. Underway for Chinwangtao, the port at the foot of the Great Wall of China, on 14 September, Augusta reached her destination on the 15th, where Admiral Murfin disembarked to visit the old imperial city of Peiping (Peking). Following his inspection of the Marine Corps legation guard at that city, CinCAF returned to Chinwangtao by train and reembarked in his flagship on 25 September. Underway from Chinwangtao on the 28th, Augusta visited Chefoo (28 September) before returning to Tsingtao on the following day, 29 September 1936. Augusta stood out of Tsingtao on the same day she arrived and reached Shanghai on 1 October. At the end of that month, on 30 October, Admiral Murfin was relieved as CinCAF by Admiral Harry E. Yarnell. Shortly afterwards, with her new CinCAF embarked, Augusta stood down the Huangpu River on 3 November 1936 on her annual southern cruise. Augusta again visited a succession of ports: Hong Kong (5 to 12 November), Singapore (16 to 23 November), Batavia (25 November to 1 December), Bali (4 to 7 December), Makassar (8 to 12 December), Tawi Tawi and Tutu Bay (14 December), Dumanquilas Bay (15 December), Zamboanga (15 to 16 December), and Cebu (17 December), before she returned to Manila on 19 December. Admiral Yarnell transferred his flag to Isabel on 2 January 1937, when Augusta entered Cavite Navy Yard for repairs and alterations that included the fitting of splinter protection around the machine gun positions at the foretop and atop the mainmast. The CinCAF used Isabel as his flagship through March, rejoining Augusta at Manila on 29 March 1937. Augusta remained in Philippine waters for the next several days, at Manila (29 March to 2 April) and Malampaya (on 3 and 4 April) before she returned to Manila on the 5th. Touching briefly at Port San Pio Quinto on 7 and 8 April, the Asiatic Fleet flagship sailed for Hong Kong on the 8th, arriving at the British Crown Colony the following day. Shifting his flag to Isabel for the trip to Canton(Guangzhou), Admiral Yarnell returned to Augusta on 13 April, and the heavy cruiser sailed for Swatow on the 18th. The ship visited that South China port on the 19th, and Amoy the following day, before the CinCAF shifted his flag again to Isabel for a brief trip to Pagoda Anchorage (21 to 22 April), rejoining the heavy cruiser on the 23rd. Augusta stood up the Huangpu River on 24 April and arrived at Shanghai that day, mooring just upstream from the city proper. She remained at Shanghai until 5 May, when she sailed for Nanking. The flagship remained at that Yangtze port from 6 May to 9 May before she got underway on the latter day for Kiukiang, further up the Yangtze. Shifting his flag to Isabel, Admiral Yarnell then visited Hankow (Wuhan)and Ichang (Yichang) in that ship, transferring thence on 22 May to Panay at Ichang for the voyage up the Yangtze through the gorges and rapids that lay above that port. After visiting Chungking (Chongqing), the CinCAF returned to Ichang in , where he rejoined Isabel for the trip to Hankow and Nanking. Admiral Yarnell eventually rejoined Augusta at Shanghai on 2 June 1937. Clearing Shanghai on 7 June, Augusta sailed for North China, and reached Chinwangtao (Qinhuang Island) on the 9th, where Admiral Yarnell disembarked with members of his staff to journey to Peking (Beijing) by rail, where the admiral would conduct the yearly CinCAF inspection of the legation guard. The admiral rejoined the cruiser at Chinwangtao (Qinhuang Island) on 22 June and the ship sailed for Chefoo (visiting that port on 24 and 25 June) and Tsingtao, arriving there on 26 June for the summer. Augusta was conducting her usual training from Tsingtao when events elsewhere in that region took a turn for the worse. Political relations between China and Japan had been strained for some time. The Chinese attitude toward the steady and unrelenting Japanese encroachment into North China in the wake of the 1931 seizure of Manchuria was stiffening. Chiang Kai-shek, China's leader, asserted that China had been pushed too far, and launched strenuous efforts to improve his nation's military posture. On the night of 7 July 1937 Japanese and Chinese units exchanged gunfire near the ornate Marco Polo Bridge in the outskirts of Peking (now Beijing). The incident quickly escalated into a state of hostilities in North China, with the Japanese taking Peking against little resistance by the end of July. Against this backdrop of ominous developments, Admiral Yarnell considered cancelling a goodwill visit to the Soviet port of Vladivostok, but was ordered to proceed. Keeping a wary eye on developments in China, Admiral Yarnell sailed for Vladivostok in Augusta on 24 July, accompanied by four destroyers. After passing through the edge of a typhoon, Augusta and her consorts reached that Soviet port on the 28th, and remained there until 1 August, the first United States naval vessels to visit that port since the closing of the naval radio station there in 1922. As Yarnell later wrote, \\"The visit of this force evidently has meant a great deal to these people\\", as both officers and men were lavishly entertained. Departing Vladivostok on 1 August, Augusta and the four destroyers sailed for Chinese waters, the latter returning to their base at Chefoo and Augusta returning to Tsingtao, where Admiral Yarnell continued to receive intelligence on the situation in North China and, as events developed around Shanghai, where increasing Chinese pressure on the comparatively small Japanese Special Naval Landing Force led to a build-up of Japanese naval units in the Huangpu River leading to that port. Hostilities commenced within days after the death of a Japanese lieutenant and his driver near a Chinese airfield on 9 August. With considerable American interests in the International Settlement of Shanghai, Admiral Yarnell deemed it best to sail there, on the morning of 13 August 1937, to make it his base of operations. Her passage slowed by a typhoon which caused the ship to reduce her speed to five knots (9 km/h) and which produced rolls of 30 degrees and washed away the port 26-foot (8 m) motor whaleboat and its davits, Augusta reached her destination the following day, and stood up the Huangpu River. En route to her moorings she passed many Japanese warships, principally light cruisers and destroyers, which duly rendered the prescribed passing honors to Augustas embarked admiral. Meanwhile, at Shanghai proper, Chinese Air Force Northrop 2E light attack bomber aircraft had tried to bomb Japanese positions in their portion of the International Settlement; the bombs fell short and caused extensive damage and heavy loss of life in the neutral portion of the settlement. One plane which had retained its bombs proceeded down the Whangpoo and dropped two bombs which exploded in the water off Augustas starboard bow. Large American flags were then painted on top of Augustas three main battery gunhouses to identify her as neutral. On 18 August Augusta unmoored, moved further upstream, and moored off the Shanghai Bund, assisted by tugs. She remained there, in a prominent position off the famous \\"Bund\\", into January 1938, observing the Sino-Japanese hostilities at close range. Initially, there was the problem of evacuating Americans from the war zone. American merchantmen called at Shanghai to do so, passengers travelling downstream to waiting steamships on the Dollar Line tender guarded by sailors from Augustas landing force. The flagship's Marine Detachment, meanwhile, went ashore to aid the 4th Marines in establishing defensive positions to keep hostilities out of the neutral enclaves. On 20 August 1937, while the flagship's crew gathered amidships on the well deck for the evening movies, a Chinese anti-aircraft shell landed among the sailors, killing Seaman 1st/Class F. J. Falgout and wounding 18 others.Reading Eagle 20 August 1937 Ten days later Chinese planes bombed the American Dollar Line SS President Hoover off the mouth of the Huangpu, with one death and several wounded. American ships ceased calling at Shanghai as a result, and Admiral Yarnell's attempts to get a division of heavy cruisers to carry out the evacuation met resistance from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At Shanghai Augustas officers and men could observe the war. Her moorings proved a good vantage point from which Americans could size up the Japanese Navy and judge how well its ships and planes operated, an opportunity not lost on Admiral Yarnell, who sent insightful intelligence reports back to Washington, striving to alert the United States Navy to the character and capabilities of the navy many regarded as the future enemy. On 12 December 1937 Japanese naval planes sank the US gunboat Panay and three Standard Oil tankers north of Nanking, in the Yangtze River. Soon afterwards the ship's survivors arrived at Shanghai in Panays sister ship, , which moored alongside Augusta on the 19th. They spent Christmas with 'Augusta's crew. On 6 January 1938 Augusta departed Shanghai for the Philippines for her yearly overhaul. Admiral Yarnell, however, his presence in China deemed necessary to uphold American prestige in the Orient, remained in Shanghai with a token staff on board Isabel. He ultimately rejoined Augusta when she returned to Shanghai on 9 April 1938 after her overhaul. Proceeding north along the China coast, Augusta visited Tsingtao (12 May to 13 May) and Chefoo (14 May) before she arrived at Chinwangtao on 15 May. There, Admiral Yarnell disembarked and entrained for Tientsin and Peking, inspecting the Marine detachments in both places before ultimately returning to Chinwangtao to reembark in his flagship on 29 May. Proceeding thence via Chefoo, Augusta reached Shanghai on 6 June; the CinCAF transferred his flag to Isabel on 23 June, and sailed for Nanking and Wuhu, returning to Shanghai and Augusta on 27 June. Returning to Tsingtao on 3 July 1938, Augusta operated in North China waters, between Tsingtao and Chinwangtao, for the remainder of the summer and through early October. Sailing for Shanghai on 10 October, the cruiser arrived at her destination two days later, and remained there through Christmas. She sailed again for the Philippines on 27 December 1938; once again, Admiral Yarnell remained in Shanghai with his flag in Isabel. Following her yearly navy yard overhaul, and training in Philippine waters, Augusta visited Siam, French Indochina, and Singapore en route back to Shanghai, making port at her ultimate destination on 30 April 1939. Again flying Admiral Yarnell's flag, she lay at Shanghai until 8 June, when she got underway for Chinwangtao. Arriving there on 10 June,she touched at Chefoo (24 to 25 June) and Tsingtao (26 June to 16 July) before she sailed down to Shanghai, arriving on the 18th. On 25 July 1939 Admiral Thomas C. Hart relieved Admiral Yarnell as CinCAF. The heavy cruiser then sailed for North China port Tsingtao, on 2 August. She remained based there—and was moored there on the day war broke out in Europe with the German invasion of Poland—through late September 1939. During this period, the ship twice visited Shanghai (5 to 7 September and 15 to 19 September), and also visited Chinwangtao, Chefoo, and Peitaiho. Late in September, Admiral Hart disembarked at Chinwangtao and inspected the Marine detachments at Peking and Tientsin. Returning to Shanghai on 12 October, Augusta remained there through mid-November; during this time Admiral Hart shifted his flag to Isabel and proceeded up the Yangtze to Nanking on an inspection trip (3 to 7 November 1939). Sailing for the Philippines on 21 November, she visited Amoy en route (22 to 23 November 1939), and ultimately reached Manila on 25 November, remaining there through early March 1940. Augusta operated in the Philippines through early April, visiting Jolo and Tawi Tawi. Admiral Hart wore his flag in Isabel during March, for cruises to Cebu, Iligan, Parang, Zamboanga, and Jolo, rejoining Augusta at Jolo on 19 March. Transferring his flag back to Isabel at Tawi Tawi two days later, Admiral Hart cruised to Malampaya Sound, ultimately rejoining his flagship on 26 March at Manila. Augusta then sailed for Shanghai while Admiral Hart, who had again transferred his flag to Isabel on 13 April, visited Swatow and Amoy, ultimately rejoining Augusta and breaking his flag on board the cruiser on 22 April. Following a month at Shanghai, Augusta sailed for North China, visiting Chinwangtao (12 June) before beginning her cycle of training operations from Tsingtao soon afterwards. Augusta operated out of Tsingtao into late September. Circumstances requiring Admiral Hart on several occasions to visit Shanghai, he travelled once to Shanghai in Isabel and back in Augusta; to Shanghai in and back to Tsingtao in Isabel; and one round trip to Shanghai and back in . Augusta departed Tsingtao for the last time on 23 September, arriving at Shanghai on the 25th. Moving on to Manila, arriving there on 21 October, Augusta remained there into late November, to be relieved by her recently modernized sister ship Houston as Admiral Hart's flagship on 22 November 1940. Augusta sailed for the United States, clearing Manila Bay that same day. On 24 November 1940, she was ordered to search the waters north of the Hawaiian chain, to investigate reports of the activity of \\"Orange\\" (Japanese) tankers in the vicinity. At this point on her way back from the Asiatic station, the cruiser encountered bad weather—heavy swells and fresh- to-strong cross winds—that rendered searching by her aircraft \\"impracticable.\\" As she neared the focal point of her search (35 degrees north latitude, 165 degrees west longitude), Augusta darkened ship and set condition III. As she passed between the two designated points on her search, she posted special lookouts from dawn to dark. Although the visibility varied between 8 to 15 miles (15 and 28 km), Augustas Captain John H. Magruder, Jr., estimated that his ship had swept a belt approximately 25 miles (45 km) wide, maintaining radio silence until well clear of the area searched. \\"Weather conditions were such that fueling at sea in the area would not have been practicable\\", Captain Magruder reported later, alluding to the reason why his ship had been dispatched to those waters, \\"and submarine operations at periscope depth would have been difficult due to the danger of broaching.\\" ===Refit=== After reaching Long Beach on 10 December 1940, Augusta entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for a major refit. While Augusta had been serving as the Asiatic Fleet flagship, alterations of the type accomplished in her sister ships had been deferred until her return to the United States. During this overhaul, the ship received significant changes in her antiaircraft battery. Four additional 5 inch (127 mm) guns were mounted atop the aircraft hangar; splinter protection was fitted for the 5 inch (127 mm) guns on the hangar and on the boat deck; interim 3 inch (76 mm) antiaircraft guns were installed (ultimate armament fit called for a one-to-one replacement of these mounts with 1.1 inch (28 mm) guns); and Mark XIX directors were installed for the 5 inch (127 mm) guns. The placement of directors and rangefinders altered her silhouette, and a pedestal was fitted atop the foremast to receive a CXAM radar antenna when it became available. Augusta was one of fourteen ships to receive the early RCA CXAM-1 radar. ===Atlantic Fleet=== Departing Mare Island on 11 April 1941, Augusta, her configuration altered and repainted, sailed for San Pedro, remaining there over 12 and 13 April. She transited the Panama Canal four days later, reporting for duty with the Atlantic Fleet on 17 April. Departing the Canal Zone on the 19th, the heavy cruiser arrived at Newport, R.I., on 23 April. Admiral Ernest J. King, now Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, returned from Washington, D.C., on 2 May and broke his flag in Augusta. The cruiser remained at Newport, serving as the administrative CINCLANT flagship (although Admiral King journeyed to Washington again during this time), through most of May, until she sailed for Bermuda on the 24th of that month. Reaching her destination on the 26th, she remained there only until the 28th, at which time she sailed for Newport once more. Augusta remained anchored at Narragansett Bay from 30 May to 23 June, when she sailed for the New York Navy Yard. She had been chosen for special duty, the inception of which had come in the developing personal relationship between US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Prime Minister of the UK (since 1939 at war with Nazi Germany), Winston Churchill. The two leaders had sought a face-to-face meeting for some time, and Harry Hopkins (President Roosevelt's personal representative) had visited Churchill and sounded him out on the proposal as early as February 1941. The President had also discussed the idea with Admiral King earlier that spring. Original intentions had been to hold such a conference in June, but British disasters in Greece and at the Battle of Crete had forced a postponement until later in the summer. Augusta had been chosen to serve as the President's flagship as early as mid-June, shortly after Admiral King had visited Roosevelt in connection with the drafting of Western Hemisphere Defense Plan No. Four. On 16 June, the New York Navy Yard commandant was informed that Augusta would soon require an availability for the installation of her CXAM radar and 1.1 inch (28 mm) antiaircraft guns, \\"incident to possible future Presidential use and other urgent work.\\" Details of the availability assignment, however, touched off a \\"little war\\" between the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) and CINCLANT. Since BuShips had no word concerning the President's plans, they issued orders to hold Augusta at New York Navy Yard for extended repairs. On 22 June, Admiral King informed BuShips, however, that alterations to the heavy cruiser \\"for possible use by the President were initiated by the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, after conversations with the President\\" and that the alteration should be limited to accomplish only \\"essential\\" items. Augusta remained in the yard at New York from 23 June to 2 July, after which time she resumed operations along the eastern seaboard, in waters off Hilton Head and Charleston, South Carolina (4 to 5 July), Hampton Roads (6 to 7 July) before she returned to Newport on 8 July. She remained there into August. During that time, details for the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill were worked out and plans set in motion to bring it to pass. While Churchill was making the Atlantic crossing in the modern battleship , the President was on his way; he departed Washington, D.C. at 1100 on 3 August for the Submarine Base at New London, Connecticut, where he embarked with his party on board the Presidential yacht , which, in company with her escort, , soon sailed for Appogansett Bay. At 2223 on 4 August Potomac anchored in Menemsha Bight, Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, joining Augusta, which had already arrived. and five destroyers lay nearby. At 05:30 on 5 August, Potomac came alongside Augusta and moored, the President and his party embarking in the heavy cruiser at 0617. For security purposes, the President's flag remained in Potomac while she, accompanied by Calypso, transited the Cape Cod Canal to New England waters. A Secret Serviceman, approximating the President in size and affecting his mannerisms when visible from a distance, impersonated the President. Press releases issued daily from Potomac led all who read them to believe that \\"FDR\\" was embarked in his yacht on a pleasure cruise. Meanwhile, Augusta, accompanied by Tuscaloosa and their screening destroyers, stood out of Vineyard Sound at 0640, at 20 knots (37 km/h), passing the Nantucket Shoals Lightship at 1125. Increasing speed slightly during the night, the ships steamed on, darkened. Outside a brief two-hour period the following day, 6 August, when the formation encountered heavy fog which forced them to slow to 14 knots (26 km/h), the ships maintained a 20 to 21 knot (37 to 39 km/h) pace for the rest of the voyage to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. Ultimately, on the morning of 7 August 1941, Augusta and her consorts stood into Ship Harbour, Placentia Bay, and anchored to await Churchill's arrival. During the forenoon, the Chief Executive indulged in one of his favorite leisure activities, fishing, from Augustas forecastle. Roosevelt \\"caught a large and ugly fish which could not be identified by name and which he directed be preserved and delivered to the Smithsonian Institute [sic] upon return to Washington.\\" At 1335, the President left the ship in a whaleboat to fish in the nearby waters, taking with him members of his party and his son, Ensign Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., USNR, an officer of on temporary duty as his father's aide. Later, after a somewhat less than successful fishing expedition, the President inspected the waterfront and the base development at Argentia. FDR and Churchill on AugustaOn 9 August, Prime Minister Churchill arrived at Argentia aboard Prince of Wales, the arrival of the battleship being viewed by the President and his party; Churchill visited the President at 1100 that day, and lunched with him in his cabin. Admiral King entertained members of the respective staffs at a luncheon in his cabin. The heavy cruiser also embarked Harry Hopkins, who had come across from England on board Prince of Wales. The Prime Minister later dined with the President, and ultimately left Augusta at 2345. The following day, came alongside and embarked the President and his party, transporting them to Prince of Wales for divine services, an inspection of the battleship's topsides, and a luncheon. President Roosevelt again entertained the Prime Minister on board Augusta that evening. On 11 and 12 August, Prime Minister Churchill and members of his staff came on board the heavy cruiser for conferences with the President and his aides; from these discussions emerged the famed \\"Atlantic Charter.\\" On the latter day, the final draft of the \\"Eight Points\\" of the charter was completed. With the meeting having been completed, President Roosevelt and his staff assembled on Augusta's quarterdeck at 1450 on 12 August to bid Prime Minister Churchill and his staff farewell. With the ship's guard and band paraded, the parting ended with the playing of God Save the King. A little over two hours later, Prince of Wales passed close aboard and rendered passing honors, after which the band stuck up Auld Lang Syne. Augusta then got under way in company with Tuscaloosa and their screening destroyers, en route to Blue Hill Bay, Maine, to rendezvous with Potomac and Calypso. The following day, a dense fog prompted the ships to reduce speed, and the President and the members of his staff rested, preparing for the transfer to the Potomac. The following morning, 14 August, off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, President Roosevelt went on deck to witness the operations of the first aircraft escort vessel (later CVE), , the prototype of a ship type that the Chief Executive had avidly pushed toward development. Long Island launched three Brewster F2A-2 Buffalos by the catapult method and six Curtiss SOCs by conventional carrier takeoff. That afternoon on board Augusta, Admiral King hosted a farewell luncheon for the President. Augusta anchored at Blue Hill Bay at 1228 on 14 August, and Potomac moored alongside to commence the transfer of baggage and other gear, ultimately casting off at 1418 for passage to Rockland, Maine. Augusta returned to Narragansett Bay on 15 August, and remained there for ten days, putting into the New York Navy Yard soon afterwards. She returned to Newport on 29 August. Admiral King retained Augusta as his flagship through the autumn, while she operated between Newport and Bermuda. During this time, she also briefly embarked Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. ===World War II=== The day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, found Augusta moored at Buoy 7, Newport. From that day until the 11th, she operated out of Newport; she remained in port until 11 January 1942. During this time, on 5 January 1942. Rear Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll (one of Augustas former commanding officers) relieved Admiral King as Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet. Augusta stood out of Newport on 12 January, en route to Casco Bay, Maine, via the Cape Cod Canal. She arrived the next day, and after conducting training exercises, returned to Newport. On 17 January, Rear Admiral Ingersoll shifted his flag from Augusta to Constellation. On 19 January, Augusta got underway for Bermuda, arriving two days later and joining Task Group (TG) 2.7. She operated with this unit when it proceeded to Martinique to conduct a \\"show offeree\\" between 22 February and 4 March, and returned to Shelley Bay, Bermuda, on 5 March. As part of TG 22.7—consisting of , , , , and —she stood out on 13 March to patrol the Caribbean. and joined the formation on 15 March, and the following day, Augusta was detached and, with Hambleton and Emmons, steamed to New York. While on passage, Augusta sent Hambleton to investigate a dim flashing light abaft her starboard beam during a heavy storm on 18 March. The destroyer rescued six survivors of the stricken Honduran steamer Ciepa, and rejoined Emmons and Augusta after nightfall. Augusta made landfall at New York on 19 March, and the heavy cruiser underwent repairs and alterations until 7 April, when, along with as escort, she sailed for Newport. The next morning, Wilkes was rammed by the steamer Davilla and was forced to proceed on one engine to Boston. Augusta steamed on alone to Casco Bay, arriving on 8 April. On 14 April, in company with and , she conducted experimental firings of turret guns against a drone simulating a torpedo plane approach, and returned to Casco Bay that night. Two days later, escorted by , she transited the Cape Cod Canal and touched at Newport. Joining Task Force (TF) 36 there, of which Ranger was flagship, the cruiser departed on 22 April for Trinidad. A minor collision between Hambleton and , and frequent submarine scares, accented the voyage. joined the task force on 28 April and fueled almost all of the ships, with Augustas scout planes maintaining an air patrol during the dangerous fueling evolution. Ranger launched 68 Army Curtiss P-40s on 10 May, the planes bound for Accra, on Africa's Gold Coast, where all landed safely. The formation arrived at Trinidad on 21 May, where Augusta fueled before putting to sea with the task force the next day bound for Newport. On 26 May, Augusta and Corry were detached and proceeded together to Hampton Roads, anchoring there on 28 May. Two days later, Rear Admiral Alexander Sharp hoisted his flag on board Augusta and assumed command of TF 22\\\\. With Corry and as escorts, the heavy cruiser sailed on 31 May for Newport, arriving on 1 June and leaving the next day with Corn for calibration of radio direction finders in waters west of Brenton Reef Lightship. Ranger joined the two ships the same day and all proceeded to Argentia, Newfoundland, arriving there on 5 June. With Ellyson and Corn, she formed an anti-submarine screen off Argentia on 17 and 18 June, and two days later joined TF 22 steaming through heavy fogs to Newport, mooring on 22 June. Augusta sailed south to New York for overhaul, arriving on 24 June. Completing repairs by 29 June, Augusta moved to Newport the following day, and on 1 July sortied with TF 22 for the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, and arrived on 6 July. The formation departed two days later, Ranger completing her second ferry mission with Army aircraft, launching 72 Army planes off the coast of West Africa. Another reinforcement successfully accomplished, the task force reached Trinidad on 30 July. The heavy cruiser then proceeded to Norfolk, and moored there on 5 August for limited availability. On 18 August, she conducted short range battle practice and night spotting exercises in Chesapeake Bay, and training continued until Augusta sortied with Ranger, Corry, and on 23 August, arriving at Newport two days later and returning to Norfolk with Corry on the last day of August. The task group also carried out gunnery training, shore bombardment, and antiaircraft defense exercises off the Virginia Capes from 7 to 11 September, and further training between 28 September and 1 October in Chesapeake Bay. On 23 October 1942, Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt came on board Augusta and broke his flag as Commander, TF 34\\\\. Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral John L. Hall, Jr. also came on board the same day for passage to North Africa. Augusta stood out on 24 October with TF 34, steaming for French Morocco and participation in Operation \\"Torch.\\" ===Operation Torch=== General Patton with Admiral Hewitt aboard Augusta off the coast of North Africa. With the initial element of surprise, at 0000 GMT on 8 November 1942, Augusta, under Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, reached the shores off Casablanca and the Task Force commenced disembarking the invasion troops under the command of General Patton who, at the time, was directing the assault from Augusta. The ship's war diary contains the following entry for that morning's Naval Battle of Casablanca: \\"The landing of our boats was heavily opposed by both shore installations and French troops and at 0617 the order to \\"Play Ball\\" was received – this meant that we were to carry out our Attack Plan and destroy to the best of our ability all resistance encountered.\\" At 0700 in Casablanca Harbor, five Vichy French submarines were preparing to stand out of the harbor to go on patrol. Merchantmen were beginning to load and unload their cargos, and on board the cruisers and destroyers the crews were at work scrubbing decks. At 0730, Ranger launched her first strike of bombers with Grumman F4F Wildcat escorts. Ten minutes later they were intercepted by French fighters, and in a dogfight five American and seven French planes were shot down. At 0804, as Rangers bombers were releasing their loads, opened up with salvoes of her 16 inch guns on Casablanca's quays and ships. In the commercial harbor ten cargo and passenger ships were sunk in 10 minutes, 40 crew killed and 60 wounded. Alongside the breakwater three Vichy submarines went down at their moorings. El Hank and Oukacha returned fire along with the battleship Jean Bart, which only had one operating turret. Wreckage hurled aboard from the quayside landed down on the turret. At 0900, the Vichy 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron under Rear- Admiral Gervais de Lafond raised sufficient steam to put to sea to head for Fedala. As his flagship Primauguet was undergoing minor engine repair, de Lafond hoisted his flag in the destroyer Milan. He steamed northwards at full speed hoping that the smoke and rising sun would blind the American naval forces. At 0920, Wildcats from Ranger strafed her decks. Every man on bridge, including Lafond, was wounded. The Vichy Boulonnais, was severely damaged. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Martinant de Preneuf, was killed on Albatross. The Brestois' anti-aircraft battery was put out of action. Primauguet was now off Fedala within range of Augusta, Brooklyn to the north and Massachusetts, Tuscaloosa and Wichita from the northeast. The first Vichy ship to sink was Fougueux, which was struck by shells from Massachusetts and Tuscaloosa. Milan, with her bow shattered and forward turret wrecked, beached. Boulonnais after being hit by eight 16-inch rounds while she was carrying out a torpedo run, turned turtle, and sunk with all hands. Primauguet, holed below her water line and with half of her engine room crew dead, dropped anchor near Milan. Brestois and Frondeur got back to harbor but capsized during the night. Finally, the destroyer Alcyon left harbor for survivors but was attacked by bombers and navy guns when she cleared the Casablanca breakwater. Albatross and Primauguet were hit again while trying to transfer 100 dead and 200 wounded. For the next three days the Augusta was engaged in protecting the transport ships and the invasion troops, and combating enemy naval and coastal resistance. On 10 November 1942 the Augusta helped turn back the French units sortieing from Casablanca who were attempting to disrupt the landings. The ship's scout observation planes played an active role in spotting the accuracy of gun splashes from ship's gunfire against the enemy ships and coastal batteries. The Augusta was straddled by shells from Jean Bart, which had been earlier mistakenly reported to Hewitt to have been out of commission. Jean Bart was subsequently put out of action by return ship and carrier plane bombardment. The invasion was successful and the ship and crew had the good fortune of being able to celebrate Thanksgiving Day 1942 with a special dinner with cuisine a la North Africa. A copy of the ship's program issued to the crew for that day is reproduced here. The message to the crew for that day summed up the feelings of all: \\"In its five engagements, one against a shore battery and four against enemy naval forces, the ship rendered a good account of itself and contributed in a large degree to the final defeat of the opposing forces and the establishing of a second front, in North Africa. In the course of each engagement the ship was subjected to accurate and heavy fire by the opposing forces. And yet, although bracketed many times by the projectiles of the enemy, the ship miraculously escaped without damage to herself or injury to the crew. It should be apparent to all that consistent escape from harm was due not alone to skill, or to good luck, but unquestionably to the intervention of divine providence.\\" ===Morocco and Atlantic Duties=== Arriving off Fedhala, French Morocco, on 7 November, Augusta went into general quarters at 2200. During the predawn hours of 8 November, the initial landings met with stiff opposition. At 0630, Augusta catapulted two Curtiss SOC scouting planes aloft, and at 0710, opened fire with her 8 inch (203 mm) guns at shore batteries. The nearby supported Augustas barrage, dodging near misses from enemy guns. A brief lull at 0730 permitted Augusta to launch her remaining two Curtiss SOC Seagulls, but 10 minutes later the enemy guns opened up again; several near misses fell within 50 to 100 yards of Augusta, the whistle of oncoming shells plainly audible to those on her bridge. Augusta shortly left at flank speed to intercept an enemy force of two light cruisers and four destroyers north of Casablanca. Closing the range at 0915, Augusta opened fire with her 8 inch (203 mm) battery on one enemy cruiser, barring the Vichy ships' passage and turning them back into Casablanca harbor by 0950. Augusta returned to her station to assist Brooklyn, firing on shore batteries. In the sortie of French ships from Casablanca harbor, destroyers and attempted a torpedo attack on Augusta and Brooklyn. Augustas main battery gunfire sank the latter, and forced the other away in a damaged condition; she sank later that day. Other Vichy ships attempting to escape were forced back into the harbor by 1122, and firing ceased for a time. Around noon, Augusta turned back s attempt to sortie, scoring an 8 inch (203 mm) hit on the French ship's turret 3. Vichy ships tried to sortie at 1305, only to be blocked and forced to retreat by 1350. Augusta spent the following day, 9 November, patrolling south and southwest of the transport area off Casablanca, and continued that patrol through 10 November. At 1135 on that day, she opened fire with her 8 inch (203 mm) guns on an enemy destroyer, straddling her and forcing her to retreat. Ten minutes later, Augusta was unexpectedly taken under fire by Jean Bart, reportedly \\"gutted by fire\\" and harmless. Geysers of water from near-misses erupted about Augusta and drenched the cruiser with yellow-dyed spray, but American carrier planes bombed Jean Bart later in the day and silenced her for the remainder of the campaign. A cease-fire agreement was signed by Allied forces with the French on 11 November, bringing the operation to an end, and opening Morocco to the Allies. Augusta departed on 20 November with TF 34, her part in the operation over. She touched at Bermuda on 26 November en route to Norfolk, arriving at the latter port four days later. There, Rear Admiral H. K. Hewitt left the ship, and TF 34 was dissolved. Augusta stood out of Norfolk on 9 December for extended overhaul at New York, during which time her antiaircraft battery was significantly improved. That period of yard work completed, Augusta proceeded to Newport, anchoring there on 15 February 1943. Refresher training took Augusta to Casco Bay two days later. She conducted air operations with her four scouting planes off the coast of Maine, and on 24 March conducted experimental fragmentation test shots, operating with Ranger on 26 to 28 March. She concluded that part of her training with night illumination exercises on 30 March and night battle practice the next day. Augusta stood out on 2 April with TF 22, flagship Ranger joining the formation on 4 April, and arrived at Little Placentia Harbor, Argentia, on 5 April. From 13 to 18 April, the heavy cruiser operated with Ranger, carried out antiaircraft practice on 22 April, and conducted flight operations with her own planes from 30 April to 1 May. In company with TG 21.7, Augusta sailed on 6 May, under orders to escort RMS Queen Mary to New York. Augusta rendezvoused with the huge liner on 9 May, and after seeing her safely into the swept channel, moored at New York on 11 May. Her mission accomplished, the heavy cruiser returned to Argentia with her task group, arriving on 17 May, and engaged in further local operations through June. Augusta closed TF 68 on 20 July and began escorting Convoy AT 54A across the submarine-infested Atlantic to the Clyde. After an uneventful passage, the convoy arrived at Greenock, Scotland, on 26 July, and Augusta continued as escort on the return voyage, relinquishing command as the convoy neared American waters, and proceeding with to Argentia, arriving on 8 August. She left the next day with Hilary P. Jones for Halifax, Nova Scotia, to rejoin TF 22, reported for duty on 10 August, and departed on 11 August for Scapa Flow, in Orkney. The British Admiralty assumed operational control of the task force, renaming it TG 112.1, as the ships neared Scotland. Augusta moored at Scapa Flow on 19 August, reporting to the British Home Fleet the same day. Augusta operated with units of the Home Fleet on 23 August and departed with for Hvalfjörður, Iceland, arriving the next day. She acted as covering force for training exercises with London and off Iceland from 2 to 10 October, and conducted gunnery training off Eyjafjörður, Iceland on 19 October. While returning to Scapa Flow, Augusta fired on a passing German Junkers Ju 88 bomber at 1139 on 27 October, firing 14 rounds from her 5 inch (127 mm) battery until the plane passed out of range. She moored at Scapa Flow on 31 October, proceeding to Greenock two days later, and returned to Scapa Flow on 7 November. On 22 November, she got underway with Ranger and other ships of the task force for Hvalfjörður, arriving two days later. Operational control passed to the United States Navy on 26 November when TF 68 stood out for Boston, Augusta mooring there on 3 December 1943. She remained there, undergoing repairs and alterations through the end of the year. Repairs completed, Augusta departed Boston on 29 January 1944 and steamed to Casco Bay for post-overhaul training exercises. She participated in bombardment, radar, illumination, and tactical exercises with TF 22 off Maine, until steaming to Boston on 7 April for limited availability. She left President Roads, Boston, and rendezvoused with convoy UT 11 the next day. However, she was soon detached from the convoy and escorted by across the Atlantic to Belfast, Northern Ireland. Arriving on 15 April, she steamed thence to Plymouth, England, on 17 April. There, Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, Commander, TF 122, came on board on 25 April and broke his flag. At 1300 on 25 May, King George VI of the United Kingdom came on board to lunch with Admiral Kirk, and departed the same day. ===Normandy=== Senior officers aboard Augusta during the Normandy Invasion. General Omar Bradley is the second man from the left. In June, Augusta took part in the Normandy invasion, standing out of Plymouth on 5 June with Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, USA, and his staff, embarked. Closing the shore on 6 June, the heavy cruiser commenced firing at 0618, hurling 51 rounds from her main battery at shore installations. VOS-7, a U.S Navy Spotter Squadron flying Supermarine Spitfire VBs and Supermarine Seafire IIIs, was one of the units which provided targeting coordinates and fire control. On 10 June General Bradley and his staff left the heavy cruiser to establish headquarters ashore. Augusta was bombed at 0357 on 11 June, but escaped damage as the bomb exploded 800 yards (730 m) off her port beam. The following day, anchored as before off Omaha Beach, she fired eight 5 inch (127 mm) rounds at an enemy plane at 2343, driving it off. On 13 June at 0352 she sent 21 rounds of 5 inch (127 mm) at a German plane, and shot it down. Augusta drove off other aircraft and bombarded the shore with her heavy guns on 15 June, and provided antiaircraft defense to the forces off Normandy on 18 June. The next day, while underway to shift berths, she lost a man overboard when he was swept overboard by heavy seas. Rear Admiral Kirk shifted his flag to on 1 July, and Augusta got underway the same day for Plymouth, mooring there on 2 July. Four days later, in company with TG 120.6, she departed for Mers el Kebir, Algeria, arriving there on 10 July, only to leave two days later with Hambleton for Palermo, Sicily. She moored at that port on 14 July and reported to TF 86 for duty. Rear Admiral Lyal A. Davidson came on board and broke his flag the same day, and Augusta stood out with Macomb and Hambleton for Naples, arriving the next day. She carried out shore bombardment exercises on 23 July. She returned to Palermo on 27 July and steamed to Naples the following day. She continued her training until 12 August, when as flagship for TF 86, she carried Brigadier General Benjamin W. Chidlaw, USA, to Propriano, Corsica, arriving the following day. On 14 August, the heavy cruiser departed the Golfe de Valinco at 1030 for Ile du Levant, southern France and the beginning of Operation \\"Dragoon\\". Augusta arrived at 2155 at the staging area, joining the Sitka Assault Group. On the morning of 15 August, Augusta trained her main battery against targets on Port Cros Island, and fired nine rounds. At 1125, she sent six. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal came on board at 2023 for an official visit with Admiral Davidson. The next day, Augusta patrolled the Sitka Assault Area and Secretary Forrestal left her at 0850. The heavy cruiser fired 63 more rounds at the fort on Port Cros Island to soften it up. On 17 August, she patrolled with and poured 138 rounds from her 8 inch (203 mm) battery into the island fort, which surrendered that day. The following day, General Chidlaw left the ship to establish his headquarters on shore, and Augusta turned her fire on the remaining coastal defense batteries. She departed on 19 August for a reconnaissance-in-force of St. Mandrier Island off Toulon, France, where the battery known as \\"Big Willie\\" was located, bombarding shore installations, and returning to the Sitka Assault Area the same day. The Golfe Hotel, Hyeres, France, was nearly leveled by 114 rounds from Augusta on 20 August. Toulon and Marseilles surrendered eight days later. On 29 August, a landing party drawn from the Marine detachments from Augusta and Philadelphia went ashore on the islands of Ratonneau and Chateau d'If in the harbor of Marseilles and accepted the surrender of German forces on those islands, taking 730 prisoners. In support of \\"Dragoon\\", Augusta had fired over 700 rounds of 8 inch (203 mm) projectiles, and had materially aided invading Allied forces. She steamed to the Gulf of San Tropez, France, on 30 August, where Admiral Davidson shifted his flag to , and Augusta was detached from TF 86. On 1 September, the heavy cruiser sailed via Propriano to Naples, where she joined Cruiser Division (CruDiv) 7. After calling at Oran, Algeria, on 6 September, Augusta, in company with Tuscaloosa, , and , stood out, bound for Philadelphia and an extensive overhaul. While undergoing these repairs and alterations, Augusta suffered an explosion of unknown origin on 20 November in her ice machine room, which killed three-yard workers and injured four crew members. Her overhaul completed, Augusta departed Boston on 26 January 1945 with and , bound for Trinidad, tested her guns en route, and arrived on 31 January. In the first week of February, she conducted refresher training in the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, polishing up on gunnery, night battle, radar, and antiaircraft techniques. She steamed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, calling there on 9 February. Sailing for the United States on 21 February, Augusta, along with , , and , rendezvoused with and her screen on 24 February as that cruiser steamed back to the United States with President Roosevelt embarked, following the Yalta Conference. After Augusta and her screen had covered the approach of the President to Hampton Roads, she underwent minor emergency repairs, remaining at Norfolk until 7 March when she steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arriving there three days later. She trained off Trinidad and Curaçao until 7 April, when joined her. Augusta returned to Norfolk on 10 April, and on 14 April, in accordance with orders from the Secretary of the Navy, half-masted her colors for a period of one month in honor of the late President Roosevelt. After a brief call at Annapolis, Maryland, she sailed north to Newport on 22 April to train 11 officers and 300 men from on a cruise. The ship conducted antiaircraft defense and other exercises in Long Island Sound until 27 April when she returned to Newport and disembarked the trainees. President Harry S. Truman tours Augusta, the ship that will take him to Europe to attend the Potsdam Conference in Germany. He and Commander C. L. Freeman are in the wardroom. (National Archives and Records Administration) Three days later, Augusta sailed for New York, and arrived there on 1 May. On 7 May, in company with , she headed for Casco Bay, where the end of the war in Europe found her, and returned to New York on 2 June. On the 13th, Augusta got underway to proceed back to Norfolk. She then conducted further training exercises in Chesapeake Bay until 7 July, when President Harry S. Truman, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy boarded her, and she stood out for Antwerp, Belgium, to carry her distinguished passengers on the first leg of their voyage to the Potsdam Conference. Met by a British escort, Augusta arrived on 14 July, and received dignitaries, including General Eisenhower. Her guests departed the same day, and Augusta got underway to proceed to Plymouth, arriving there on 28 July. On 2 August, she embarked her distinguished passengers again, and received another visit from King George VI. Harry Truman was on the ship when he got the news that Hiroshima had been bombed by an atomic bomb. The ship then sailed for the United States, arriving at Newport on 7 August to disembark the President. A week later she moored in Casco bay. After carrying out training at Baltimore, Maryland, she arrived at Norfolk on 11 September, and conducted exercises off the Virginia Capes until steaming to Casco Bay again on 5 October for temporary duty under the direction of Commander, Operational Training Command, Atlantic, Commander TF 69\\\\. She then proceeded to New York, and participated in Navy Day observances on 27 October at New York City, where President Truman reviewed the fleet. Open to the public from 25 to 30 October, Augusta hosted 23,362 visitors. === Postwar === On 31 October, Augusta moored at the New York Naval Shipyard, to be modified for \\"Magic Carpet\\" operations, bringing home American servicemen from Europe. She performed this duty through the end of the year 1945. On 16 July 1946, Augusta was ultimately placed out of commission, in reserve, in a deferred disposal status at Philadelphia. She remained in the Philadelphia group of the Reserve Fleet until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959. She was sold for scrap on 9 November 1959 to Robert Benjamin of Panama City, Florida, and her hulk removed from naval custody on 2 March 1960. ==Awards== Augusta was awarded three battle stars for her World War II service. ==See also== * Other ships named USS Augusta ==References== * ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Augusta (GA) Museum of History – Museum includes a permanent exhibit on the USS Augusta * * Film of the Augusta in port in Shanghai in the 1930s (commences 04:37) - Sign welcoming USS Augusta is at 01:27 Category:Northampton-class cruisers Category:World War II cruisers of the United States Category:United States Navy Georgia-related ships Category:1930 ships Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia ","title":"USS Augusta (CA-31)"},{"id":"515551","text":"The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century.

A mostly white breed with either a smooth, rough or broken coat, it conforms to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders. ==History== John \\"Jack\\" Russell, dog breed developer and namesake of this and other white terriers. :This breed shares a common history with the Jack Russell Terrier until the early 1980s. This type of small white terrier dates back to the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he purchased a small white and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier. In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club was founded by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed standard for this type of terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded. In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was reformed with the aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997. On 1 August 1999, the PJRTC successfully petitioned the Kennel Club (UK) to change the name of the breed to the Parson Russell Terrier, with the name of the breed club following suit. The international kennel association, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, recognised the Parson Russell Terrier on 4 June 2001. The American Kennel Club updated the name of the recognised breed from Jack Russell Terrier on 1 April 2003. The United Kennel Club adopted the new name on 23 April 2008. The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC), New Zealand Kennel Club and United Kennel Club (UKC) are the only three major kennel clubs to recognise both the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier separately. In 2009, there were 18 Parsons registered with the ANKC compared to 1073 Jack Russells. ==Description== A judge spanning a Parson Russell Terrier. The Parson Russell Terrier is bred to conform to a conformation show standard. Unlike its close relative, the Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terriers have noticeably longer legs that are about as tall as the length of the Terrier's body. It is a predominantly white breed with black, tan or tricolour markings and an easy to groom coat which is either smooth or broken (similar to a smooth coat, but with some longer hair on the head, face, legs or body). The breed standard does not recognise a Parson Russell with a curly or rough coat. There is a clear outline with only a hint of eyebrows and beard should the dog be broken coated. They possess moderately thick small \\"V\\" shaped drop ears with the tip pointed towards the eyes. The nose of the dog should be black. The normal range of sizes is between tall at the withers, with a weight around . The Parson Russell has a relatively square outline, with a body about as long as the dog is tall. Compared to the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell has a longer head and a larger chest along with overall a slightly larger body size. The Parson retains the flat skull but not the elongated shape of the Fox Terrier, and with lower set ears. In addition, the Jack Russell Terrier has a greater variation in size, ranging between in height at the withers. Two hands should be able to span the chest of the dog behind its elbows, with the thumbs at the withers. This is required in show judging, with the judge lifting the dog's front legs gently off the ground in this motion in order to measure the size of the chest. The judges fingers should meet under the chest and the thumbs on top of the spine. The American Kennel Club describes this as a \\"significant factor and a critical part of the judging process.\\" It is not done to measure the size of the chest, but rather to feel for the correct shape. Under the show standard, there are several physical points which would be treated as faults in the show ring. These are for the height of the dog at the withers to be outside of the standard range, or for the dog to possess either pricked up ears, a liver or brown coloured nose, an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings. ==Temperament== A broken coated Parson Russell Terrier The Parson is a feisty and energetic type of Terrier. They can excel in dog sports such as flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise in order to prevent them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench. They can be playful with other dogs, and get along with horses. The breed standard requires that shyness be treated as a fault, although it states that this should not be confused with submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring. ==Health== Eye conditions which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal and begin to disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support the lens of the eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds. Other eye conditions which appear in the breed include cataracts in juveniles, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related conditions which may affect a Parson are deafness and patella luxation. The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years. == In popular culture == * Uggie (2002 - 2015), a trained Parsons Russell Terrier, was an animal actor, appearing in commercials starting in 2005 and most notably cast in Water for Elephants and The Artist, both in 2011. In the same year, based on interest following The Artist, the \\"Consider Uggie\\" campaign was launched, which attempted to gain the dog a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2012, Uggie was named Nintendo's first-ever spokesdog. * Sykes (est. 2001 - 2019), a dog actor from Clifton, Oxfordshire, England, who appeared as \\"Harvey\\" in Thinbox's three televisions commercials and, under his real name, in five seasons of Midsomer Murders.

Sykes was also a champion agility competitor. ==References== ==External links== * Category:FCI breeds Category:Terriers Category:Dog breeds originating in England ","title":"Parson Russell Terrier"},{"id":"515556","text":"The Russell Terrier is a predominantly white working terrier with an instinct to hunt prey underground. The breed was derived from Jack Russell's working terrier strains that were used in the 19th century for fox hunting. Russell's fox working strains were much smaller than the Show Fox Terrier and remained working terriers. The size of the Russell Terrier (10\\" to 12\\") combined with a small flexible, spannable chest makes it an ideal size to work efficiently underground. Their unique rectangular body shape with the body being of slightly longer length than the leg makes them distinctly different from the Parson Russell Terrier and the Jack Russell Terrier of the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA). The Russell Terrier originated in England, but the country of development was Australia. ==History== The name Jack Russell Terrier was never used to describe a breed of dog. Rather, it became a common name for any predominantly-white earth-working terrier after the death of the clergyman Jack Russell. The only requisite was color, the instinct combined with the will to employ earth-work, and the size to work efficiently underground. Still today, the name is widely used for working terriers of the Parsons Reverend's style. It was in the country of development, Australia, that this 10-12 inch dog was first standardized by Kennel Club recognition with the official name \\"Jack Russell Terrier\\" applied to the breed. This ultimately led to recognition of the breed by FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale) countries, including Ireland and most recently, the US. Unfortunately, due to the previous use of the name in the US and England, the name Jack Russell Terrier is conflicting. In the US, a terrier conforming to the Australian/FCI standard is simply called a Russell Terrier. The Russell Terrier is a very popular companion breed in the US. The breed is a working breed, not a companion breed. They are bred by dedicated fanciers to preserve their working functional conformation and the instinct to employ their original purpose as earth terriers. This makes them an excellent performance breed participating in a variety of events: natural hunting which includes earthwork, agility, rally, obedience, tracking, go-to-ground, and conformation, etc. They are also therapy and service dogs. === Breed development in England and Australia === In the early 1970s, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain was formed, and this body instituted a very primitive form of registration. Soon, Jack Russell Terrier Clubs were being formed worldwide, including Australia. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of Australia was formed in 1972. This national organization set up a particularly comprehensive registration system, along with a formal breed standard. This club also initiated discussions with their KC regarding the possibility of the breed being accepted for registration as a pure breed. === The Russell Terrier in the US === The Russell Terrier, also known as the FCI type Jack Russell Terrier, is a recognized Kennel Club breed and is maintained separately from the AKC Parson Russell Terrier and the UKC Parson Russell Terrier. In 2001, the United Kennel Club accepted the application from the English Jack Russell Terrier Club to give dogs in their registry the official \\"FS\\" designation. UKC officially recognized the breed as the Russell Terrier because the name Jack Russell Terrier was already in use for the longer legged dog in 2001. The UKC breed standard was changed in 2005 from the original standard of 2001. In 2009 the UKC changed the name to Jack Russell to go back to their original standard and align themselves with the rest of the world. The American Kennel Club AKC accepted the breed into the FSS Program on December 8, 2004 based on the FCI Jack Russell standard also submitted by the EJRTC, aka the American Russell Terrier Club. The American Rare Breed Association recognized the \\"Russell Terrier\\" in 2003, with the old UKC standard originally written by the UKC. This standard was based on the same standard written by Australia and used also in Ireland. The original ARBA standard was then changed by the NRTFC to a new standard in November 2008, than again on January 1, 2010. The AKC parent club for the Russell Terrier changed the FCI breed standard in 2010 and introduced their own standard which is now different from the rest of the world and FCI. The NRTFC was the first and is the only organization in the world and history of the breed to recognize only the smooth coated dog. However, after 15 years of maintaining the Russell Terrier in the US and longer internationally as a distinctly separate breed, due to the rectangular appearance unique only to the Jack Russell/Russell Terrier, they can no longer be considered variations.Profile of a smooth Russell Terrier. ==See also== *Jack Russell Terrier Club of America ==References== * Burns, Patrick. \\"American Working Terriers\\". 2005. * Lucas M.C., Jocelyn M. \\"Hunt and Working Terriers\\" First published 1931.

This involved the billeting of ill-disciplined dragoons in Protestant households with implied permission to abuse the inhabitants and destroy or steal their possessions. The soldiers employed in this role were satirized as \\"missionary dragoons\\". ==Background== With the Edict of Nantes in 1598, Henry IV had ended France's Wars of Religion by granting a relatively high degree of toleration to the Huguenots, as well as political and military privileges. The latter were abolished in 1629 under the Peace of Alès following the Huguenot rebellions, but the provisions of the Edict granting religious tolerance were largely maintained under the governments of the Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin. Louis XIV, however, aimed to have religious uniformity in his kingdom. Initially he offered the Huguenots financial incentives to convert, but this had limited effect. By the late 1670s he decided upon a harsher policy. He began to order the destruction of Huguenot churches and the closure of Huguenot schools. ==Implementation== Louis XIV combined legal persecution with a policy of terrorizing recalcitrant Huguenots who refused to convert to Catholicism by billeting both dragoons and ordinary infantrymen in their homes. The soldiers were instructed to harass and intimidate the occupants, in order to persuade them to either convert to the state religion or emigrate. As mobile mounted infantry, the 14 regiments of dragoons in the French Army of the period were sometimes used for what would now be called internal security duties, and were an effective instrument for persecuting the Huguenots.Rene Chartrand, \\"Louis XIV's Army\\", The application of selective and coercive troop quartering had been initiated by the intendant René de Marillac in Poitou, in 1681. With the permission of the Secretary of State for War François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, Marillac systematically lodged troops with Protestants, in the expectation that existing laws exempting households newly converted to Catholicism from this practice would spur conversions. Billeted troops got so far out of hand that, after a series of reprimands in letters, the Marquis de Louvois was forced to recall Marillac from Poitou.This episode is recounted in L. L. Bernard, \\"Foucault, Louvois, and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes\\", Church History 25.1 (March 1956):27-40) p. 32ff, and remarked in Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Louis XIV: Louis XIV and Protestants\\"; Musée virtuel du protestantisme français\\" les draghonnades. ==Outcome== The persecution of Protestants caused outrage in England and created a wave of literature in protest against the inhumane treatment of Huguenots, thousands of whom fled to England to seek asylum. The dragonnades policy caused Protestants to flee France, some even before the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685 revoked the religious rights granted them by the Edict of Nantes. Most Huguenot refugees sought refuge in countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands (from where some migrated to the Cape Colony in southern Africa), England, and the German territories (notably Brandenburg- Prussia). Smaller numbers also fled to New France, the English colonies in North America, or Lutheran Scandinavia. On January 17, 1686, Louis XIV claimed that his policies had caused the Protestant population of France to decline from 800,000-900,000 to 1,000–1,500. Though he greatly exaggerated, their numbers did decline significantly. According to Hans J. Hillerbrand, an expert on Protestantism, Huguenot numbers had been steadily declining since the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572. The campaign ultimately proved detrimental to France's economy, as many were part of the nascent urban bourgeoisie, and many others possessed skills such as silkweaving, clock-making, silversmithing, and optometry. The Huguenot exodus boosted the economies of the countries to which they fled, including Louis's opponents: the United Netherlands and England. == See also == *Camisard *French Wars of Religion *Persecution of Huguenots under Louis XV *Religions in France == References== == Bibliography == * * ==External links== * Musée Virtuel du Protestantisme Français: \\"Les dragonnades (1681-1685)\\"— Category:Huguenot history in France Category:Anti-Protestantism Category:Louis XIV Category:Religion in the Ancien Régime Category:1681 establishments in France Category:17th century in France ","title":"Dragonnades"},{"id":"515570","text":"Wang Guangya (born March 1950; )http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/1344 is a Chinese diplomat who is the former Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China.

(1974) 'The origins of the term ethnomethodology', in R.Turner (Ed.) Ethnomethodology, Penguin, Harmondsworth, pp 15–18. It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream sociological approaches.Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge. In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.Garfinkel, H. (2002) Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism, Rowman & Littleford, Lanham. Its early investigations led to the founding of conversation analysis, which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see ).Psathas, G. (1995) Talk and Social Structure' and 'Studies of Work, in Human Studies, 18: 139–155. Ethnomethodology provides methods which have been used in ethnographic studies to produce accounts of people's methods for negotiating everyday situations.Randall Collins, Michael Makowsky (1978). The discovery of society. London: Random House. Page 232 It is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.Wes W. Sharrock, Bob Anderson, R. J. Anderson (1986) The ethnomethodologists. London: Taylor & Francis. . Page 18 However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.Rooke, J. & Seymour, D. (2005) 'Studies of Work: Achieving Hybrid Disciplines in IT Design and Management Studies', Human Studies 28(2):205–221. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/642 ==Definition== The term's meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: ethno – method – ology, for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: ethno refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); method refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ology refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the \\"how\\" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with sociological studies.Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993. ==Origin and scope== The approach was originally developed by Harold Garfinkel, who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954. His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room as a jury. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge This interest developed out of Garfinkel's critique of Talcott Parsons' attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of Alfred Schutz, though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz's ideas.Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. & Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London. Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of Durkheim and Weber; and the traditional sociological concern with the Hobbesian \\"problem of order\\".Anne Rawls, \\"Harold Garfinkel\\", Blackwell Companion to Major Social Theorists, ed. G. Ritzer. Blackwell: London, 2000. For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexivity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study. This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. John Heritage writes, \\"In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory.\\"Heritage, J. (1984). Garfinkel and ethnomethodology. Cambridge, U.K: Polity Press. Page 5. ==Theory and methods== Ethnomethodology has perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method.Doug Maynard & Steve Clayman, \\"The Diversity of Ethnomethodology\\", ASR, V.17, pp. 385–418. 1991. A survey of various ethnomethodological approaches to the study of social practices. Pages 413–418.John Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, Cambridge:Polity. 1991.(). Page 1 With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory. A multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to Ethnomethodology's Program, might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel's life.Harold Garfinkel (2002). Ethnomethodology's Program. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. . Page 4. However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology's understanding of the significance of \\"member's methods\\", and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure. It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. & Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London References are also made in Garfinkel's work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch (Gestalt Theory), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz's studies of the lifeworld (Lebenswelt); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein's understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of doing ethnomethodological investigations. Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied. Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways, and the point of these investigations is \\"to discover the things that persons in particular situations do, the methods they use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life.\\" Michael Lynch has noted that: \\"Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is adequate to the particular phenomena under study\\".Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.Garfinkel, H. & Wieder, D. L. (1992) 'Two Incommensurable, Asymmetrically Alternate Technologies of Social Analysis', in G. Watson & R. M. Seiler (eds.), Text in Context, Sage, London, pp. 175–206. ==Some leading policies, methods and definitions== ; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies : As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: \\"If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so\\". That is, \\"...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations.\\" ; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: \\"Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements.\\" \\"The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders.\\" Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empiricist. Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the unique adequacy requirement. ; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a 'vulgar competence' in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting. ; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference. ; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate agnosticism, or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of \\"deviance\\", analysis of behavior as rule governed, role theory, institutional (de)formations, theories of social stratification, etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny. The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member's) concern. ; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the indexical and reflexive properties of the actors', or observer's, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer's inescapable reliance on the hermeneutic circle as the defining \\"methodology\\" of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.Mark Okrent, Heidegger's Pragmatism, Cornell University Press, 1988. Pages 157–172 ; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared social order. For example, driving the wrong way down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise—a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household—is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach—especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting. ; Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned. ; Durkheim's aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: \\"...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts.\\" This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the objectivity of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study. An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a \\"misreading\\" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor. ; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive—they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe. ; Indexicality : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification operationalisation. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior.Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. () (first published in 1967) The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a \\"segment\\" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a \\"working consensus\\" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of meaning as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974). ; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, \\"alternate reading\\", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, \\"...translate point to point\\", but, \\"...instead, they go together.\\" No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading—the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: \\"incommensurable.\\" The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology. ; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use \\"reflexivity\\" as a synonym for \\"self-reflection,\\" the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant \\"to describe the acausal and non-mentalistic determination of meaningful action-in- context.\\"Michael Lynch, Mark Peyrot. \\"Introduction: A reader's guide to ethnomethodology\\". Qualitative Sociology. Springer Netherlands. 2005. See also: Reflexivity (social theory). ; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. Garfinkel recovered the concept from the work of Karl MannheimKarl Mannheim, \\"On the Interpretation of Weltanschauung\\" (1952),in, From Karl Mannheim (ed. Kurt Wolf), Transaction Publishers, 1993. and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology. Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the \\"document of\\", \\"as pointing to\\", as \\"standing on behalf of\\", a presupposed underlying pattern. These \\"documents\\" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle. This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of Gestalt theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.Aron Gurwitsch, The Field of Consciousness, Duquesne University Press, 1964 [out-of-print]. Pages 202–227 ; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group member's concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial (adumbrated) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual noema, and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: \\"you can't do anything unless you do read his texts.\\" ; Ethnomethodology's field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order. ==Differences with sociology == Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies.Attewell, Paul. (1974). \\"Ethnomethodology since Garfinkel,\\" Theory and Society 1(2): 179–210. However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices.Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. () (first published in 1967). Page: viii The Ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action.Hugh Mehan & Houston Wood, The reality of ethnomethodology. 1975. Chichester: Wiley. . Page 5. This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or 'poke fun' at traditional sociological forms . In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.Kenneth Leiter, A Primer of Ethnomethodology. 1980. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . Page 14. In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors' characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, \\"value states\\", \\"sentiments\\", \\"goal orientations\\", \\"mini-max economic theories of behavior\\", etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific \\"normative order\\" as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc. For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting's features. The job of the Ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual's party to those settings. The differences can therefore be summed up as follows: # While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the facticity (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared. # While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings. == Varieties == According to George Psathas, five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as: # The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel's seminal Studies in Ethnomethodology. # The organisation of talk-in-interaction. More recently known as conversation analysis, Harvey Sacks established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson. # Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings. # The study of work. 'Work' is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed. # The haecceity of work. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition? Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard & Clayman's work. ==Relationship with conversation analysis== The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is \\"inexorably intertwined\\" with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: \\"Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversation analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools.\\" On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and \\"formal analytic\\" enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology. The \\"danger\\" of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversation analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the unique adequacy requirement of methods. == Links with phenomenology == Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a \\"phenomenological sensibility\\", and reliable commentators have acknowledged that \\"there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology...\\" (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), orthodox adherents to the discipline—those who follow the teachings of Garfinkel—do not represent it as a branch, or form, of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. The confusion between the two disciplines stems, in part, from the practices of some ethnomethodologists (including Garfinkel), who sift through phenomenological texts, recovering phenomenological concepts and findings relevant to their interests, and then transpose these concepts and findings to topics in the study of social order. Such interpretive transpositions do not make the ethnomethodologist a phenomenologist, or ethnomethodology a form of phenomenology. To further muddy the waters, some phenomenological sociologists seize upon ethnomethodological findings as examples of applied phenomenology; this even when the results of these ethnomethodological investigations clearly do not make use of phenomenological methods, or formulate their findings in the language of phenomenology. So called phenomenological analyses of social structures that do not have prima facie reference to any of the structures of intentional consciousness should raise questions as to the phenomenological status of such analyses. Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being \\"appropriated\\" and intentionally \\"misread\\" for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order. These appropriations and methodical \\"misread[ings]\\" of phenomenological texts and findings are clearly made for the purposes of furthering ethnomethodological analyses, and should not be mistaken for logical extensions of these phenomenological texts and findings. Lastly, there is no claim in any of Garfinkel's work that ethnomethodology is a form of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. To state that ethnomethodology has a \\"phenomenological sensibility\\" or that \\"there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology\\" is not the equivalent of describing ethnomethodology as a form of phenomenology (see Garfinkel/Liberman 2007:3–7). Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the actual doing of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his \\"Field of Consciousness\\" (1964: ethnomethodology's phenomenological urtext): \\"you can't do anything unless you do read his texts.\\" == References  Notes = Bibliography === * Bar-Hillel, Y.

The name is derived from the Kifuru and kishi verb Kuragira ngavu, meaning to herd cows; ngavu means cow or cows. It has been described as Africa's most active volcano and has erupted over 40 times since 1885. As well as eruptions from the summit, there have been numerous eruptions from the flanks of the volcano, creating new smaller volcanoes that have lasted only for a short time (e.g. Murara from late 1976 to 1977). Recent eruptions occurred on 2 January 2010 and 8 November 2011. ==Geography and geology== Nyamuragira volcano is an active volcano near the city of Goma of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated about north of Lake Kivu. It is in the Nord-Kivu Province. It is north-north-west of Nyiragongo, the volcano which caused extensive damage to the city of Goma in its 2002 eruption. Nyamuragira has a volume of , and covers an area of . It has a low shield profile and contrasts with adjacent steep-sided Nyiragongo volcano. Sulfur dioxide emissions by volcanoes, 1979-2003. Nyamuragira volcano is responsible for a large portion of the sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere by volcanoes. Lava flows from Nyamuragira (upper left) extend to Lake Kivu. ==Recent activity2010 eruption=== At dawn on 2 January 2010, Nyamuragira began spewing out lava flows. There are no settlements close to the volcano, but wildlife officials feared that the eruption may threaten the chimpanzees in the area. Another danger was that the lava could have flowed into the southern sector of Virunga National Park, where there are settlements and villages. Extensive lava flows from the 2010 eruption can be seen on satellite photographsGoogle Earth shows the crater and lava flows very clearly at coordinates -1.408333, 29.200000 reaching south-west to Lake Kivu, about north-west and north-north-east. ===2011 eruption=== The volcano erupted again on 5 November 2011. That eruption produced a high column of lava, and it is said to have been its largest eruption in 100 years. ===2014 lava lake=== Part of crater of Nyamuragira volcano In 2014, a new lava lake appeared at the volcano for the first time in 75 years. The previous lava lake at the volcano was emptied in the 1938 lava flow. The formation of the new lake occurred between June and August 2014. It reached a depth of }. The eruption did not affect the communities in the area but left a lot of ash and air pollution. Sulfate aerosols formed by volcanic sulfur dioxide from the eruptions were observed as far away as over the central Amazon rain forest in South America. By 2018, the lava lake had hardened and the activity appeared to have stopped.

It is a tidal island, linked to the mainland by a natural shingle causeway called the Dhorlin near Campbeltown at low tide. The crossing can be made in around 40 minutes. Davaar was known as the island of Sanct Barre between the years 1449 to 1508. The modern form Davaar is from older Do Bharre - thy St Barre. Dr Gillies in his \\"Place Names of Argyll\\" appears to accept the popular derivation, Double-pointed (Da-Bharr) Island.

The Lookout, a square building standing on a small knoll close to the lighthouse, was built during World War II to house naval crews, whose task it was to stretch anti-submarine nets across the water, protecting Campbeltown. It is now rented out as a holiday home.Peter Caton (2011) No Boat Required - Exploring Tidal Islands. Matador. Entrance to the cave containing Archibald MacKinnon's painting The island is also known for its seven caves, one of which contains a life size cave painting depicting the crucifixion, painted in 1887 by local artist Archibald MacKinnon after he had a vision in a dream suggesting him to do so. The painting caused uproar in the area as it was seen as a sign from God; it is said that when the townsfolk discovered it was MacKinnon, and not God, he was exiled from the town indefinitely. Restored several times since, including twice by the original artist, the painting was vandalised in July 2006, having a red and black depiction of Che Guevara painted over the original masterpiece. It has since been restored again. Davaar Island is one of 43 tidal islands that can be walked to from the mainland of Great Britain and one of 17 that can be walked to from the Scottish mainland. There are 2 cottages available to let for holidays. ==Stamps== Local stamps were issued for Davaar in the 1960s. The stamps served the many visitors to the island who wished to have their mail posted there, and carried by the boatman to the nearest GPO Post Box at Campbeltown on the mainland. The boatman service ended some time in the early 1970s.

The population in 2011 was 175,136,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 23.78 km² (9.2 sq mi). It is the most densely populated municipality in Portugal. ==History== There is significant evidence of Neolithic settlements in the municipality. The Necropolis of Carenque consists of three artificial caves that served as tombs from around 3000 BCE. Originally named Porcalhota, for being a Majorat of the daughter of a man surnamed Porcalho who was called for being a female Porcalhota. The Aqueduto das Águas Livres, which brings water from the Sintra hills to Lisbon, and stretches , was finished in the 1770s and includes the largest masonry arch ever built, located in Campolide — the local coat of arms also displays the aqueduct (like others along its way). At the request of its population, in 1907, a decree issued during King Carlos I reign, merged the communities of Porcalhota, Amadora and Venteira into one town named Amadora. At the present time Amadora does not have any airfield. However, in the 1920s a small airfield (the first in Portugal) was located here. The first flight from Portugal to Brazil left from Amadora. The Captain of the airplane was Adm. Gago Coutinho, a well known Portuguese celebrity. The municipality was formed on 11 September 1979, when it ceased being a parish of the municipality of Oeiras. Few days later, on 17 September, Amadora was granted city status. The former Sorefame railway rolling stock factory was located in Amadora, but was closed in 2004. Most of the carriages for Portuguese Railways built during the second half of the 20th century were constructed here. ==Geography== One of the largest urban communities in Portugal, Amadora forms a conurbation with Lisbon, sharing the same subway, bus and train networks. It is dominated by large apartment blocks, commercial parks, industrial areas and some headquarters of international companies. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (freguesias): * Águas Livres * Alfragide * Encosta do Sol * Falagueira-Venda Nova * Mina de Água * Venteira ==Economy== Despite being essentially a residential city, Amadora has commercial zones, industries and headquarters of international companies operating in Portugal. As commercial zones, it has IKEA, Nokia, Decathlon, Alegro, Continente and Dolce Vita Tejo (one of the biggest shopping malls in Europe).

Wagner was most respected among his colleagues and students for his genius in discerning and articulating the differences in form between plant species in the context of their variation with environmental factors. He developed, in the early 1960s, the first algorithm for discerning phylogenetic relationships among species based upon their respective character states observed over a set of characters. This work was honored by James Farris and Arnold Kluge in their later appellation of related algorithms as \\"Wagner parsimony.\\" Wagner became a pteridologist later in life, specializing in ferns, especially the Botrychiaceae. Having served in the U.S. Military in the Pacific Theater in World War II, he maintained a lifelong interest in the diversity and origin of the ferns of Hawaii. Working with his wife Florence Wagner, an accomplished cytologist, he resolved the relationships of an array of polyploid complexes in North American ferns, first the Appalachian trio of Asplenium species, then in Dryopteris and Polystichum. He was President of the Botanical Society of America in 1977. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1985.

Rool (Japanese: キングクルール, Hepburn: Kingu Kurūru) is a fictional anthropomorphic crocodile and the main antagonist in Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game franchise, as well as the archenemy of Donkey Kong. K. Rool is the villainous leader of a group of crocodilian raiders known as the Kremlings, who have crossed paths with the Kongs on many occasions. First appearing in the 1994 video game Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, he has been described as being \\"to Donkey Kong what Bowser is to Mario.\\" He is depicted as a crazed Kremling who frequently feigns defeat in order to deceive the Kongs; he tricks them by wearing different disguises and utilizes a variety of weapons to his advantage. K. Rool resembles an overweight crocodile with an infected, bulging eye. The name \\"K. Rool\\" is a play on the word \\"cruel\\", a nod to his malevolent nature. In addition to video games, K. Rool has appeared in the manga adaption of Donkey Kong Country, the Donkey Kong Country animated series, comics and several pieces of Nintendo merchandise. In Donkey Kong 64 and the Game Boy Advance ports of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy, K. Rool's voice was provided by former Rare developer Chris Sutherland. K. Rool is currently voiced by Japanese voice actor Toshihide Tsuchiya, who also provides the voice of Funky Kong. ==Characteristics == Two prototype Kremlings; Krudd is an early version of King K. Rool. In his debut appearance, King K. Rool is depicted as a large obese crocodile with a red cape, golden wristbands, a golden belly plate, large crown and a large bloodshot eye. He was designed by Steve Mayles, an artist who worked at Rare and brother of Donkey Kong Country designer Gregg Mayles. In later appearances, K. Rool's attire changes depending on which persona he is masquerading as. His aliases include Kaptain K. Rool, Baron K. Roolenstein, and King \\"Krusha\\" K. Rool. K. Rool has also been seen piloting a variety of vessels, including Gangplank Galleon, a large pirate ship in Donkey Kong Country, the Flying Krock, a steampunk inspired flying machine while in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest, and the Knautilus, a fish-shaped submarine that appeared in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. From DK: King of Swing onward, K. Rool was redesigned with a more cartoony appearance with brighter green skin, a smaller and less bloodshot eye, no tail, a tan-colored underbelly and a smaller crown. This incarnation of K. Rool also makes an appearance in Mario Super Sluggers for the Wii, wearing Maya king attire and wielding a green sceptre. His overall design in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is based on this appearance, but with elements taken from his previous design, such as his tail, golden belly plate and dark green skin. K. Rool is described as being \\"demented\\" and \\"unbalanced\\" in his Super Smash Bros. Melee trophy description, citing his desire to blow up DK Isles in Donkey Kong 64. In a former Rareware.com scribes column, Gregg Mayles stated that K. Rool's motivation for stealing the banana hoard is that he wants Donkey Kong to starve to death so that he can occupy his \\"cosy treehouse pad,\\" or perhaps that he simply likes bananas. The latter explanation is supported by the manual of the first game, but contradicted in DK: Jungle Climber, as K. Rool states that he hates bananas. When asked what the K in \\"K. Rool\\" stands for, Mayles stated: “It was just a way of making him seem more important, that he'd added it to inflate his ego,” joking that \\"it could have been something tonal like 'Kremling,' or something deliberately out of character, like Keith.” == Appearances Main appearances===  Donkey Kong Country  King K. Rool made his debut appearance as the final boss of Donkey Kong Country. He battles by tossing his crown at the player. King K. Rool appears in Donkey Kong Country as the final boss. Here he steals the Kongs' banana hoard and must be fought on his pirate ship, Gangplank Galleon. This ship later appears as the introduction stage of Donkey Kong Country 2, and again as a sunken ship in Donkey Kong 64. During this battle, K. Rool attempts to punish the Kongs by running into them, jumping on them from above, tossing his crown, and summoning a downpour of cannonballs, presumably from the ship's mast. Halfway through the battle, K. Rool feigns defeat, causing the game's \\"Kredits\\" to roll. This is an attempt to deceive the player, as he gets back up soon after and must be jumped on a few more times before the battle truly ends.  Donkey Kong Country 2  In Donkey Kong Country 2, K. Rool is given the \\"Kaptain\\" moniker and kidnaps Donkey Kong. He wears a pirate costume resembling that of real pirates during the Elizabethan era, complete with a large black hat, frilly robe, and a blunderbuss as his weapon of choice. This disguise complements the pirate motif of Donkey Kong Country 2. The Kongs confront Kaptain K. Rool aboard the Flying Krock, a flying machine that hovers above Crocodile Isle. During this battle, they must avoid an onslaught of cannonballs and toxic gases that can either reverse the player's controls, slow them down, or briefly stun them. Kaptain K. Rool is fought a second time in Krocodile Kore, a volcano located in the Lost World of Crocodile Isle. To gain access to this level, players must collect every bonus token and present them to Klubba, a muscular Kremling who guards the Lost World, which is heavily implied to be the Kremlings' place of origin. After K. Rool is defeated once more, a cutscene takes place showing Crocodile Isle exploding against a sunset, with the Kong family observing from a nearby cliff.  Donkey Kong Country 3  Following the events of Donkey Kong Country 2, K. Rool goes into hiding due to the destruction of Crocodile Isle. This time he kidnaps both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, imprisons the Queen Banana Bird, and heads to the Northern Kremisphere. Here he resides in Kastle Kaos, and takes on the role of a helipack-wearing mad scientist, aptly named Baron K. Roolenstein. He tricks the heroes Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong into believing that he has been defeated and KAOS—a Frankenstein-esque robot—is responsible for kidnapping the other Kongs. Once they reach the castle, they are shocked to learn that K. Rool has been the true mastermind behind the plot. He states that, \\"I'd have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids\\", a reference to the cartoon Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. Baron K. Roolenstein is battled twice; first in Kastle Kaos, and again in the Knautilus, a submarine that is located in this game's hidden world, Krematoa. The name Krematoa is likely derived from the volcanic island Krakatoa. During both boss fights, K. Rool utilizes electricity and technology to torment the Kongs. After being defeated for a second time, K. Rool is chased around the North Kremisphere by the vengeful Queen Banana Bird.  Donkey Kong 64  Rather than just kidnap the other Kongs and steal bananas, King K. Rool decides to take a more barbaric approach by planning to blow up Kong Isle with his \\"Blast-o-matic\\" laser. K. Rool wears his traditional King attire for the majority of the game, but in the final battle against the Kongs, he wears a boxing outfit under the ring name of King \\"Krusha\\" K. Rool and does battle with them in front of his Kremling subordinates. This final boss fight has five rounds due to there being five playable characters, though typical boxing matches usually have up to twelve rounds. Much like in his original appearance, K. Rool would attempt to trick the Kongs by playing dead. After being distracted by Candy Kong in a brief cutscene, Funky Kong delivers the final blow to the Kremling King with a mechanical boot. ===Other appearances===  Video games  In addition to his primary roles in Rare's Donkey Kong Country games, King K. Rool appears in Donkey Kong Land, Donkey Kong Land 2, Donkey Kong Land III. He also appears in several Donkey Kong games following Microsoft's acquisition of Rare in 2002, including Donkey Konga, DK: King of Swing, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, and DK: Jungle Climber. K. Rool's first playable appearance outside of the Donkey Kong series was in Mario Super Sluggers. He is the strongest right-handed batter in the game, but has poor stamina and fielding. He shares good chemistry with Kritter and King Boo, and bad chemistry with the Kongs and Bowser. K. Rool was planned to appear in Diddy Kong Pilot for the Game Boy Advance, which was later reworked into Banjo-Pilot due to Rare no longer having the authorization to use the Donkey Kong license. Leaked beta footage shows K. Rool wearing an aviator outfit. In the Super Mario Odyssey level New Donk City, there are several street name signs that reference Donkey Kong characters, including K. Rool. In the Super Smash Bros. series, K. Rool initially appeared as a collectible trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee and every title since. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, an outfit bearing his resemblance was made available for download as a Mii fighter costume. He is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, becoming the third character representative for the Donkey Kong franchise. K. Rool's moves are based on his various appearances throughout the Donkey Kong series, including his crownerang from Donkey Kong Country, his belly flop from Donkey Kong Land, his blunderbuss from Donkey Kong Country 2, his propellerpack from Donkey Kong Country 3, his boxing gloves from Donkey Kong 64, and a Donkey Kong 64-inspired Final Smash that involves K. Rool firing his Blast-o-matic laser. In his weekly Famitsu column, series director Masahiro Sakurai stated that K. Rool was selected to join the roster because he \\"received a ton of votes\\" in the Smash Bros. Fighter Ballot. K. Rool, along with Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, are featured prominently in Banjo and Kazooie's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate reveal trailer, titled \\"Best Friends\\". This trailer continues where K. Rool's trailer left off, showing the Kremling King sleeping in Donkey Kong's treehouse alongside his nemeses. All three characters celebrate their reunion with Banjo and Kazooie, who have connections to the Donkey Kong universe via Diddy Kong Racing and Rare.  In other media  King K. Rool appears as a main character in the Donkey Kong Country animated series, portrayed by Canadian theater actor Benedict Campbell. In most episodes, K. Rool attempts to steal the Crystal Coconut, an ancient relic that is said to possess extraordinary power. This iteration of K. Rool has slimmer proportions, a smaller cape, and no tail. His left eye, while retaining the tic from the games, which is no longer bloodshot. He is accompanied by his two Kremling henchmen, Klump and Krusha, who appear in the Donkey Kong Country video game as generic enemies. ==Reception== Since his debut in 1994, King K. Rool has received a mostly positive critical reception. ScrewAttack placed the character at number nine on their list of Top 10 Nintendo Villains, noting that \\"What makes King K. Rool such a joyful villain is his blend of classic cartoonish style by looking at the fourth wall and playing dress-up on occasion and a menacing edge that shows when the battles get intense.\\" K. Rool's appearance in Donkey Kong 64 was ranked number 85 on New York Magazine's list of '100 Hardest Video Game Bosses'. On her list of 'The Top 25 Most Powerful Nintendo Villains', Ashley Glenn of Comic Book Resources stated that K. Rool is not only \\"iconic,\\" but \\"he's also one of the few villains that does something new every game we see him in.\\" Game Revolution gave K. Rool the number two spot on their list of characters who deserve a spot in Super Smash Bros., arguing that \\"it's been far too long since we've seen the Kremlings get some proper representation, with the reptilian foes being conspicuously absent from both of Retro Studios' DKC titles. It's time, Nintendo. Bring back K. Rool!\\" Game Rant listed K. Rool at number eight on their list of the 'Top 10 Most Iconic Nintendo Villains', stating \\"We've been waiting patiently for K. Rool to pop up in one of Retro's Donkey Kong Country games, but at this point, we'd settle for a spot on the Super Smash Bros. roster instead.\\" Playtonic Games, a development team containing many former Rare employees, campaigned for his inclusion as Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U downloadable content. Additionally, many fan conducted polls had found King K. Rool to be a highly requested character in the Smash Bros. Fighter Ballot, an online survey Nintendo held to determine future DLC contenders. On August 8, 2018, King K. Rool was finally confirmed as a playable character in Super Smash Bros Ultimate. His reveal was accompanied by a pre-rendered and gameplay trailer titled \\"The Rivals.\\" Fans responded to K. Rool's inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate by sending series director Masahiro Sakurai a thank you letter. ==See also== *List of fictional crocodiles and alligators ==References== Category:Animated series villains Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Donkey Kong Category:Fictional boxers Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters who can turn invisible Category:Fictional criminals in video games Category:Fictional crocodilians Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Fictional kings Category:Male villains Category:Fictional pirates Category:Fictional scientists Category:King characters in video games Category:Nintendo antagonists Category:Super Smash Bros. fighters Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game characters introduced in 1994 Category:Video game secret characters fr:King K.

The suffix employed to form this noun may have different values: while primarily yāna is understood to refer to the means (kara.na) through which one goes to/ reaches a location, it may technically also refer to the action itself (bhāva). Yāna is therefore primarily a \\"vehicle\\", in most contexts relevant to the Buddhist doctrine of three yānas. \\"Vehicle\\" is often used as a preferred translation as the word that provides the least in the way of presuppositions about the mode of travel. In specifically Buddhist contexts, the word yāna acquires many metaphorical meanings, discussed below. ==Teaching story and metaphor== In the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (1.33-34), Shakyamuni Buddha relates a story on vehicles of conveyance utilizing the sacred river Ganges, all of which may be engaged as a metaphor for yana and a gradual or direct path: > 1.33 And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river > was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people were looking > for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together > a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a > strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from > this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other > shore. > 1.34 And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat, looking for > a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. And > seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on the spot: ::'When they > want to cross the sea, the lake or pond, ::People make a bridge or raft - > the wise have crossed already.'Maurice Walshe (1995). The Long Discourses of > the Buddha: A Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya. Boston: Wisdom Publications, > \\"[DN] 16: ': The Great Passing, The Buddha's Last Days,\\" pp. 238-239.In > Buddhist countries throughout Southeast Asia and the Himalaya, the crow is > sacred as it voices the sacred syllable \\"Ah\\". The crow drinks of the river > which is a metaphor for the continuum of mind, the mindstream. These two verses are meant to teach that all vehicles, teachings and doctrine are skillful means (Skt.upāya). ==Introduction and qualification of the term yana== The Bodhipathapradīpa of Atisha (980-1054 CE), quoted in Gampopa's (1079-1153 CE) Jewel Ornament of LiberationDam chos yid bźin nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan rendered into English by Günther, makes reference to people of three capacities: > Man is to be known in three ways: > As inferior, mediocre and excellent.Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert > V.

As is written: > :Standing in the boat of the human body, :You should cross the great flood > of misery. :Since later this boat is difficult to get, :Do not sleep now, > you fool.Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert V.

In the teaching story abovementioned, Shakyamuni Buddhi and his sangha traverse the continuum directly in the body'Body' is to be read as Trikaya. of their own experience rather than constructing a gradual vehicle for passage. ==Usage== In Buddhism and Hinduism, both yāna and mārga (road or path) are metaphors depicting spiritual practice as a path or journey. Ancient texts in both religions discuss doctrines and practices associated with various yānas. In Buddhism, yāna often expands the metaphor of the spiritual path with the idea of various vehicles that convey a person along that path. The yāna / mārga metaphor pervasive within Buddhism and other traditions is an analogue to the Chinese metaphor of the Tao: The Tao though is the Way as the endgoal and not just the art of wayfinding. The dialogic spiritual traditions of Indian and Chinese culture hold common cultural memes. ==Vedic origins of -yāna as a spiritual journey== The use of yāna to use as a name or to refer to a spiritual journey may date to the ', possibly composed circa 1500 BCE, whose 10th Mandala makes several references to devayāna, (translators usually render this as the \\"path of the gods\\" or similar) and one reference to ' (\\"path of the fathers\\"). The first verse of the 's burial hymn (10.18) translates approximately as \\"O Death, take the other path, which is distinct from the way of the gods\\" ('). The \\"other path\\" is the ', referred to in hymn 10.2 and alluded to in 10.14 and 10.16. The devayāna and ' evolved from the ancient Rig Vedic concern for immortality to the classical Hindu concern with ending existence. The , which comment on the Vedas, make further reference to devayāna and '. Among other distinctions, the pitryana was said to refer the religious practices of villagers, and the devayāna was said to refer to the practices of recluses living in the forest. The (II.iv.11 and IV.v.12) also makes reference to ekayāna, notably in the phrase ', where ekayānam connotes \\"one journey\\". The phrase translates approximately to \\" Sacred Vedas - intonation - (is the) one journey/destination\\", in the same sense that a river's journey is to the ocean. ==Yāna in early Buddhist texts== Yāna is one of ten suggested gifts (dana) that a lay person can appropriately give a monk or recluse, in the sense of providing a vehicle or transportation (e.g., see DN 7.33/PTS: A iv 59 and DN 10.177/PTS: A v 269). The earliest explicit Buddhist use of -yāna in a metaphorical sense of a journey to awakening may be the term dhammayānam, \\"dharma chariot\\" (SN IV.4), where the vehicle itself serves as an extended metaphor for the Eightfold Path. Various parts of the chariot represent aspects of the Path (magga), e.g. axles represent meditation, the charioteer represents mindfulness, and so on. Thus, metaphorical usage of yāna in the sense of a vehicle (as distinct from a path) emerged from a Buddhist context, and it did so relatively early in the evolution of Buddhism. Nevertheless, while the Pali Canon are very rich in images of wheels (cakka) and paths (magga) as metaphors for the journey to awakening, the Pali Canon rarely uses the term yāna for that purpose. According to Fujita Kotatsu the term Three Vehicles does not occur in the Pâli tripitaka, however corresponding terms (trîni yânâni, triyâna, yânatraya) are used in the Ekottara Agama, the Mahavastu, and the Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra. In these texts the Three Vehicles include the srâvakayâna, pratyekabuddhayâna, and buddhayâna. ==Enumeration of yānas in Mahayana texts== Mahayana texts are very rich in images of vehicles that serve in metaphors for journeys to awakening. ===The three carts of expedient means: the parable of the burning house=== The tradition of Mahayana texts employing the image of different types of vehicles and conveyances as salient metaphor for the journey of novice to the awakening of adept may have begun with the Lotus Sūtra. The Lotus Sūtra holds a parable of a devoted father with three small children entranced in childhood play within the family home, oblivious that tongues of flame are ravenously engulfing the house. The father entices the children from the burning home with the half-truth gilded promise of special carts for each of them. The carts though are only an expedient means for luring the children from the house.Pye, Michael (2003), Skilful Means - A concept in Mahayana Buddhism, Routledge. pp. 37-39 Katō et al. render thus into English a tract of the Saddharma Puṇḍarīka pertaining to the cart of expedient means and the parable of the burning house: > \\"Śāriputra! Even as that elder, though with power in body and arms, yet does > not use it but only by diligent tact resoutely saves [his] children from the > calamity of the burning house and then gives each of them great carts made > of precious things, so it is with the Tathāgata; though he has power and > fearlessness, he does not use them, but only by his wise tact does he remove > and save all living creatures from the burning house of the triple world, > preaching the three vehicles: the śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and Buddha > vehicle.Katō, Bunnō (translator); revised by: Soothill, W.

Tokyo: Kosei Publishing > Co. , p. 89 In the parable, the carts are explicitly identified as corresponding to the three types of Buddha: the goat-cart represents the practices leading to the attainment of Arhatship; the deer-cart, Pratyekabuddhahood; and the bullock- cart, Samyaksambuddhahood. The sutra goes on to say these that the teachings of the three vehicles are merely expedient means (upāya). Their purpose is to direct people toward ekayāna, the one vehicle, depicted in the parable as a jeweled cart driven by a white ox. ===The relationship of Dharma (Law) and Yana=== Tamura et al. render a section of the Innumerable Meanings Sutra (Wu- liang-i ching) that relates the relationship of the Law (Dharma) and various teachings as fundamentally determined by the audience and context: > \\"Good sons! The Law is like water that washes off dirt. As a well, a > pond, a stream, a river, a valley stream, a ditch, or a great sea, each > alike effectively washes off all kinds of dirt, so the Law-water effectively > washes off the dirt of all delusions of living beings. > \\"Good sons!

These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term Ekayāna in the sense of \\"one vehicle\\". This \\"one vehicle\\" became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of Tiantai and Tendai Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced Chán and Zen doctrines and practices. In Japan, the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also inspired the formation of the Nichiren sect. ===Two yānas=== Traditionally, the two vehicles in Mahāyāna Buddhism consist of Śrāvakayāna and Pratyekabuddhayāna. Mahāyāna Buddhists take a vow to become the third type, namely bodhisattvas. Therefore, Mahayana Buddhist texts sometimes use terms like \\"followers of the two vehicles\\" to refer to Buddhists who do not accept the Mahayana sutras. Some Mahāyāna sutras consider that the two vehicles together comprise the Hīnayāna – literally, inferior vehicle; sometimes, small vehicle. Modern texts sometimes refer to Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna as \\"two vehicles\\". But referring to an \\"inferior vehicle\\" is often felt to be disrespectful to those Buddhists who do not consider the Mahāyāna sutras to be buddhavacana. ===Three yānas=== Mahāyāna Buddhists often express two different schemata of three yanas. First, here are three paths to liberation that culminate as one of the three types of Buddha: *Śrāvakayāna: The Hearer vehicle: A path that meets the goals of an arhat who achieves liberation after listening to the teachings of a samyaksambuddha (fully enlightened buddha). *Pratyekabuddhayāna: The Pratyekabuddha achieves liberation, but does not teach other beings. Pratyekabuddhas do not depend on a teacher and can discover the Dharma even if they do not encounter a buddha. They are sometimes said to remain silent and solitary. *Bodhisattvayāna: The bodhisattva attains liberation and wishes to benefit as many beings as possible. A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksambuddha. A samyaksambuddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment. A second classification came into use with the rise of the Vajrayāna, which created a hierarchy of the teachings with the Vajrayāna being the highest path. The Vajrayāna itself became multilayered especially in Tibetan Buddhism. * Hīnayāna * Mahāyāna * Vajrayāna ===Four yānas=== Mahayana Buddhists sometimes refer to four yanas that subsume the two different schemes of the three yanas: * Śrāvakayāna * Pratyekabuddhayāna * Mahāyāna * Vajrayāna ===Five yānas=== This is a Mahāyāna list which is found in East Asian Buddhism. * Puruṣayāna - the human vehicle. This is the very beginning of the spiritual path * Devayāna - the practice of ethics and meditation * Śrāvakayāna - the practice of renunciation and the Four Noble Truths * Pratyekabuddhayāna - practice concerned with dependent arising (pratitya-samutpada) * Bodhisattvayāna - practice of the Six Perfections ===Six yānas=== The five yānas plus the Vajrayāna. This schema is associated with Shingon Buddhism in Japan. It was invented by Kūkai in order to help to differentiate the Vajrayāna teachings that he imported from China in the early 9th century. Kūkai wanted to show that the new teachings were entirely new. ===Nine yānas=== The Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism has nine yanas, a list made by combining the first type of three yanas, and adding the six classes of tantras. *Hīnayāna ** 1. Śrāvakayāna ** 2. Pratyekabuddhayāna * Mahāyāna consisting of: ** 3. Bodhisattvayāna ** Vajrayāna, consisting of: *** Outer Tantras **** 4. Kriyatantra **** 5. Upatantra (Tibetan spyod rgyud) ‘practice tantra’ and the Ubhayatantra (gnyis ka’i rgyud), ‘dual tantra’, because it practices the view of the next vehicle, Yogatantra, together with the action of the former. **** 6. Yogatantra ***Inner Tantras **** 7. Mahāyoga **** 8. Anuyoga ****9. Atiyoga (also Dzogchen) The head of the Nyingma school, Dudjom Rinpoche emphasizes the eight lower vehicles are intellectually fabricated and contrived: ===Twelve yānas=== Another schema associated with Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna sources: # Śrāvakayāna # Pratyekabuddhayāna # Bodhisattvayāna # Kriyayoga # Charyayoga (or Upayoga) # Yogatantra # Mahayoga # Anuyoga # AtiyogaThe Sanskrit \\"Atiyoga\\" may be rendered as \\"primordial\\" (ati) \\"communion\\" (yoga) and is also known by the Sanskrit: Mahāsandhiyoga and in Tibetan: Dzogpa Chenpo and often rendered as Dzogchen in English. ## Semde ## Longde ## Mengagde ==See also== * Navayana * Vahana ==Notes== ==External links== * Brahmana Sutra (metta.lk) in Pali, Samyutta Nikaya IV.4 (scroll to middle of page, or Find... the word dhammayànaü) * Simile of the Dhamma Chariot (Dhammayana) (scroll downto the 5th entry) Partial translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV.4 * Sanskrit Dictionary based on The Practical Sanskrit- English Dictionary of Vaman Shivaram Apte Enter yaana in the search box * Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon Project.

The territory is home to the huge Caniapiscau Reservoir, the largest body of water in Quebec. The reservoir was named after Lake Caniapiscau that was flooded in 1981 during the formation of the reservoir. The name comes from the Cree or Innu term kaniapiskau or kaneapiskak which means \\"rocky point\\" or \\"place where there is a rocky point\\". Albert Peter Low had noted in 1895 that \\"a high rocky headland jutts into the lake.\\" He probably referred to the northwest facing peninsula that gives the reservoir the shape of an arc as we know it now. In the 19th century, Lake Caniapiscau was frequented by hunters and fur traders. In 1834, the Hudson's Bay Company opened there an outpost to link its facilities in the James Bay region with those of Ungava Bay. The Kaniapiskau Post closed its doors in 1870. ==Community== Map of the Caniapiscau Reservoir. Caniapiscau () is a small community without a permanent population, just north of the Caniapiscau Reservoir. It was formed as a temporary worksite in 1974 for workers involved in the construction of the dams and floodgates of this reservoir. The reservoir was built as part of the James Bay Project that gave rise to the La Grande hydroelectric complex. Accessible only by air from 1974 to 1976, when a temporary landing strip was cleared on a nearby frozen lake, by an ice road from James Bay from 1977 to 1979 and, since late 1979, by the long gravel Trans-Taiga Road (French: Route Transtaïga) which branches off the James Bay Road (French: Route de la Baie James). The worksite was closed after construction ended towards 1984. The between Caniapiscau and Brisay is not recommended for vehicles other than four-wheel drive due to large rocks on the coarse-gravel surface. The site is now used by an outfitter (fishing and caribou hunting) and there is also a commercial floatplane base.Air Saguenay Base on Lac Pau ==Demographics== Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 census * Population in 2011: 0 * Population in 2006: 0 * Population in 2001: 0 * Population in 1996: 0 * Population in 1991: 0 ==Transport== Caniapiscau is accessible by car via the Trans-Taiga Road.

He is the founder of West Coast Choppers and current CEO of Austin Speed and Jesse James Firearms Unlimited, both based in Austin, Texas. He was the focus of a show chronicling some of the custom motorcycle builds in his TV series Jesse James: Outlaw Garage, which ran a shortened single season in 2012 on the Discovery Channel before being canceled. James was the host of the reality TV shows Jesse James Is a Dead Man on Spike TV and Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel, and the focus of the documentary Motorcycle Mania, also on Discovery. He also appeared in the 2004 skateboarding video game Tony Hawk's Underground 2. ==CareerCustom motorcycles and cars=== After working as a bodyguard, James opened West Coast Choppers in his mother's garage in 1992. James has also built and is racing an off-road Trophy Truck and a Figure-8 race car. ===Other business ventures=== James was the owner of the Cisco Burger restaurant, which opened on April 28, 2006 across the street from West Coast Choppers. It has officially closed. James also had partial ownership in Austin Speed Shop in Austin, Texas, which he left in 2013 to focus on the re-opening of West Coast Choppers in Austin. Other business ventures include the Chopperdogs fan club and the Jesse's Girl clothing line. James published the now-defunct Garage magazine. In November 2013, Jesse James Firearms Unlimited unveiled its first two firearms, a 1911 pistol and AR-15 rifle. His first rifle-caliber suppressor was a basic reworking of an original Maxim design that he claimed could impossibly bend the laws of physics by offering a 78 dB rating at the muzzle, lower than even what the De Lisle carbine achieved in testing; although James was careful to note that it only achieved that number with subsonic ammunition that does not produce a sonic boom. As of 2020, James lives in Austin, Texas, operates Jesse James Fire Arms Unlimited and manages the intellectual properties of West Coast Choppers. ===Television=== James (left) on the set of Monster Garage, 2003 In 2000, the Discovery Channel made the documentary Motorcycle Mania, which chronicled James's everyday life. Following the success of the documentary, the Discovery Channel approached James with an offer to host a new show called Monster Garage where James and a crew of mechanics modified vehicles under a short deadline. James later established Payupsucker Productions, under which he produced shows like History of the Chopper, Iraq Confidential with Jesse James and Green Scream, in which James plans to break the land speed record with an eco-friendly hydrogen car. Through James's show \\"History of the Chopper\\" there are also glimpses of his involvement with the Hells Angels. He also had an appearance on Discovery Channel's Sons of Guns. He appeared on the second season of Celebrity Apprentice. Each celebrity played to raise money for a favorite charity; James selected to play for the Long Beach Education Foundation. Due to his poor performance in raising funds, James was eliminated by Donald Trump on the second-to-last show (ultimately placing third) which aired May 3, 2009. Trump repeatedly cited James's stoic refusal to contact then-wife Bullock to raise funds for the show's challenges, though other celebrities had no problem tapping high-rolling contacts for cash. 2010 Academy Awards His show Jesse James Is a Dead Man premiered on Spike TV on May 31, 2009. The show features James doing death defying stunts. The first episode set a ratings record for Spike, drawing the largest audience ever for an unscripted series on the network, with 2 million viewers. The show is produced by Spike TV, BASE Productions and James's company, PayupSucker Productions.\\"Jesse James Is A Dead Man\\" at MyFoxLA.com In conjunction with that appearance Marvel Comics created a special one-shot comic book where he evades death once again after considering retirement, and made it available in comic book stores for free distribution. James appeared on an episode of Street Customs where he had his pickup truck customized by West Coast Customs.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490374/ He appeared in an advert for T-Mobile's Google mobile phone with Whoopi Goldberg and Phil Jackson.T-Mobile Gets Phil Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg To Help Sell New Google Phone (This source misspells his given name as \\"Jessie\\".)

He asked the Red Jacket Firearms team to build a customized Browning Automatic Rifle for him, and even assisted in the build himself.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2309595/ Jesse appeared in special \\"Biker Build-Off\\" episodes of American Chopper in 2011 and 2012 for bike build-off competitions with Paul Teutul Jr. (representing Paul Jr. Designs) and Paul Teutul Sr. (representing Orange County Choppers), with Gas Monkey Garage (featured on the Discovery series Fast N' Loud) entering the competition in 2012. ==Personal lifeFamily and relationships=== James' Discovery Channel website states that his great-great-grandfather was the notorious outlaw's cousin. However, Eric James, president of the James Preservation Trust, which tracks claims of being a relative of the outlaw, says it cannot find a record of him in the family tree, and has asked him to provide a family genealogy and DNA sample for the trust to review; he has not provided the requested information. James has three children: a daughter and a son with his first wife, Karla James, to whom he was married from 1991 to 2002; and a daughter with his second wife, stripper/adult actress/producer Janine Lindemulder, to whom he was married from 2002 to 2004. On July 16, 2005, James married his third wife, actress Sandra Bullock. They met when she arranged for her 10-year-old godson, a fan, to tour the set of Monster Garage. In October 2009, James's ex-wife Lindemulder, who had been in federal prison for six months for tax evasion, sought to regain custody of her then five-year-old daughter with James—Sunny—after James had been granted sole guardianship of her. James sought to retain full guardianship, citing fear of the environment in which his daughter would be placed if returned to Lindemulder. In December, James won custody, and Lindemulder was given weekly visitation rights during the daytime. In March 2010, a media scandal arose when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock. Bullock cancelled European promotional appearances for The Blind Side citing \\"unforeseen personal reasons.\\" On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. James declared that \\"There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me,\\" and asked that his wife and children one day \\"find it in their hearts to forgive me\\" for their current \\"pain and embarrassment.\\" James’ publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010, that James had checked into a rehab facility \\"to deal with personal issues\\" and \\"save his marriage\\" to Bullock. However, on April 28, 2010, it was reported that Bullock had filed for divorce on April 23 in Austin, Texas. Bullock also stated that she had proceeded with plans to adopt a baby boy born in New Orleans. Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four years earlier. The child began living with them in January 2010, but they chose to keep the news private until after the Oscars in March 2010. However, given the couple's separation and then divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of the baby as a single parent. The divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with \\"conflict of personalities\\" cited as the reason. In August 2010, tattoo artist Kat Von D confirmed reports that she and James were dating.\\"'LA Ink' Star Sets the Record Straight About Her Relationship with Steve-O\\", BuddyTV.com, August 16, 2007 James and Von D became engaged in January 2011. Additional . Von D announced that they had split in July 2011.\\"Kat Von D Walks Out on GDLA Interview\\", MyFoxLA.com (KTTV website), July 27, 2011. WebCitation archive. However, in August 2011, James and Von D announced that their engagement was back on. In September 2011, Von D announced that she and James had broken up again. Von D later accused James of cheating on her with multiple women during their relationship. In late 2012, James became engaged to professional drag racer Alexis DeJoria. They married on March 24, 2013, at the estate of the bride's father, entrepreneur John Paul DeJoria. In March 2020, James announced his separation from DeJoria after seven years of marriage, stating \\"our lives were just headed in different directions\\". ===Legal troubles=== In 2007, James was fined $271,250 by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) after state officials determined that he had sold motorcycles in violation of California's clean-air laws. According to authorities, James's customized bikes were emitting 11 times the legal limits of hydrocarbons. Investigators also found that the motorcycles did not have state-certified emissions equipment on their fuel tanks. The bikes were sold between 1997 and 2006. James explained that he was unaware of rule changes that required small-volume manufacturers to comply with regulations. James said the CARB refused his offer to recall and modify the uncompliant choppers. Since 2005, West Coast Choppers has built emissions- compliant choppers. James said the fines were excessive and intended to make an example of him due to his company's fame and his celebrity marriage to actress Sandra Bullock, but CARB spokesmen stated their enforcement efforts were aimed at the entire custom industry, and further that they were aware of no offer by West Coast Choppers to recall the motorcycles in question. In July 2008, James faced a $422,680 breach of contract lawsuit from Michael Jones, a customer who hired James to build him a custom car, who contended that after paying $270,000 over two years, the car was not completed, and that James informed him that it would cost between $600,000 and $700,000. That September, James faced another lawsuit from his former lawyer for $327,533 in unpaid fees. In 2010, James was accused by Fortune Fashions Industries, LLC of working with Walmart and stealing one of Fortune Fashions Industry’s executives to work on the clothing line after a failed collaboration between Jesse and Fortune Fashions Industries. Fortune Fashions Industries claimed over 6 million dollars in damage. Lawyer Lawrence H. Nagler, representing Fortune Fashion Industries, claimed \\"Jesse has stolen the benefit of Fortune Fashion's work and manpower to put this together.\\" James' lawyer, Joseph A. Yanny pointed out that James was a prolific entrepreneur long before he met Fred Kayne, the owner of Fortune Fashions, selling his West Coast Choppers brand apparel in his own shop and online. The trial concluded with the verdict in favor of James. When Fortune Fashion Industries asked the judge to squash the jury decision, the judge stated that Fortune Fashions Industries was \\"not entitled to any proceeds from an unrelated line of clothing that came into being a year after the failed venture.\\" ==References*Jesse James: The Man and His Machines.

Located at the gates of the peninsula, surrounded by three seas, protected by four hills, rich in fresh water and saltwater, fertile plains, it has been an important political, cultural and ecclesiastical centre. It is possible that there was a bishop in Ston as early as at the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th century. Initially it was an Illyrian settlement until the Romans established their own colony there, in 167 BC. Croats appeared there in the early 7th century, and converted to Christianity. In 533, at Saloon, a diocese was established in Sarsenterum for the Zahumlje or Hum area, which belonged to the church in Ston (Pardui). Later Sarsenterum was destroyed (most likely at the time of Avara's destruction). Since Ston was not included on Avara's ruinous visit, it was spared, and became the seat of the principals. As the secular and ecclesial powers grew together, it is assumed that after the disappearance of Sarsenterum, Ston became the ecclesiastical center. We see the diocese first mentioned in 877 as a diocese of the old age, and the bishop is listed as a suffragan of the Split metropolis. By setting up a metropolis in Dubrovnik, Ston became a suffragan of Dubrovnik. Upon the arrival of the Serbs, the area of the Neretva (from the northern Herzegovina mountains to Rijeka Dubrovačka) was established by the prince of Zahumlje - same as Neretva, Primorje and Herzegovina, which also belonged to Ston with Rat (Peljesac) and Mljet. Local rulers acknowledged the supremacy of Byzantium. After Mihajlo Višević, who acknowledged the authority of Bulgarian Simeon, Zahumlje was ruled over by different dynasties. Around 950, it was briefly ruled by Duke Časlav. At the end of the 10th century, Samuilo was the Lord of Zahumlje, and the dukedom belonged to king Ivan Vladimir. In 1168, the Dukedom and Zahumlje were conquered by Raški major prefect Stevan Nemanja. Thirty years later, Zahumlje was invaded by Andrija, the Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia. In 1254, Béla IV of Hungary conquered Bosnia and Zahumlje. From 1304, Zahumlje was ruled by Mladen Šubić, then again for a short period by Serb parishioners, and from 1325 by Stjepan Kotromanić, and finally by Dubrovnik. The old Ston was located on the slopes of the hills of Gorica and St. Michael, south of the Ston field. There were several early Christian churches there, the largest of which was St. Stephen's Church. The bishopric church of Mary Magdalene stood until it was bombed by the Allies in 1944. The only church that still remains is the church of St. Michael, built in the middle of the late antique castrum. View of Ston The original old town was demolished in the earthquake of 1252. With the arrival of the Republic, a new city was built on today's location. When renovations were made at the church of St. Michael at the top of the hill, fragments of Roman decorative plaster, Roman tombstones and antique ceramics were found, confirming this assumption. According to some sources, Ston experienced a destructive civil war in 1250, and in these conflicts the city suffered a great deal of destruction. The turbulent times at the beginning of the 14th century spread across the entire country of Zahumlje. The usurpation by the Branivojević brothers, forced the people of Dubrovnik to fight them in 1326 with the help of Stjepan Kotromanović (Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia). That year, Dubrovnik occupied Ston. The Dubrovnik people immediately began to build and establish a new Ston, to defend the Pelješac and protect the slaves from which they had earned big revenue. Since the conflict between the Ban in Bosnia and Serbian king, the Dubrovniks purchased Pelješac with Ston from both rulers in 1333. The first cathedral church was that of St. Mary Magdalene on Gorica. The Church of Our Lady of Lužina was built in the 10th century. The Cathedral Church of St. Blaise was built in 1342 upon the decision of the Senate after the adherence of Ston to the Dubrovnik Republic at the site of today's damaged parish church. From then on until the fall of the Dubrovnik Republic, Ston was an integral part of the Republic, and its second city of importance. In 1333, Dubrovnik started with the planned construction of the fortresses of Ston (Veliki Ston) and Little Ston (Mali Ston) at the present site. The cladding between the two towns along their entire length were made of large walls that were supposed to defend the Dubrovnik estate - Pelješac. This entire fortification complex, which is unique to Europe was built over a short period of time. The downfall of the Republic of Dubrovnik took place due to the sudden and often incomprehensible operations in the 19th century. The city walls of Little Ston were demolished to suppress malaria. The monumental stone fortification complex of Ston suddenly collapsed in preparation for the official visit by Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph - the stones became a quarry for nearby new outcrops and foundations. The restoration of the stone monuments and the reconstruction of the fortifications and the tower resumed only after 1945, however they were again damaged in the Homeland War (1991-1992), followed by the devastating earthquake of 1996. Recently, thanks to the Society of Friends of the Dubrovnik Walls, the stone forts and towers are being reconstructed, so that the monumental stonewall complex now begins to live again in its old dignity. == Cultural monuments Walls of Ston=== After the Republic of Dubrovnik acquired the Pelješac in 1334, it required the protection of Ston. First, in thirty years, one of the longest defense walls in Europe was erected on one side of the peninsula, and according to a unique project, two new towns were planned: southern Ston and northern Little Ston with the aim of encompassing people to preserve the boundaries and work in solanas the state had acquired. Between 1461 and 1464, the Florentine architect Michelozzo commissioned the building of the wall by the order of the Dubrovnik Republic. The Great Wall is 1200 m long, and was built to ensure protection from neighbours. The chronicles state that the construction of the wall lasted for 18 months and cost 12,000 ducats. The fortress of Ston was one of the largest construction projects of the time, with an original length of 7000 m, consisting of the walls of Ston and Little Ston. The Great Wall consists of three fortresses, and the walls and fortresses are flanked by 10 rounds of 31 squares and 6 semi-circular bastions. The complex defense corps has been shaped over the course of four centuries, due to the development of weapons. The walls were of great importance because they were defending the saltworks that gave 15,900 ducats every year to the Dubrovnik Republic, the shellfish farm and the city itself. In 1667, about 0.5 km of walls were destroyed in a catastrophic earthquake, and the walls were significantly damaged in the earthquakes in 1979 and 1996. In 2004, work on the restoration of obsolete walls was started, with the aim of facilitating visits to the area between Ston and Little Ston. It was assumed that the works would be completed by May 2008, but only the original part of the Ston Bridge was rebuilt. The reconstruction of the Great Wall in Ston, worth about five million kuna (€673,000), was completed, and it was announced that the stone walls with public entrance fee will be opened in May 2009. Part of the wall is open to the public since October 2009 for a fee. Until 2013, the original part of the city, the road have been restored. It takes 15 minutes to get to the first part, and 30 minutes to get from the Great to the Small Wall. Today the greater part of the walls have been restored. ==See also== *Pelješac ==Gallery== File:Ston Street.jpgStreet in Ston File:Ston, Croatia.jpgFountain in the centre File:Ston in Croatia.jpgSton Municipal Building File:Entrance to Ston City Walls.jpgEntrance to Ston City Walls File:St. Blaise Church, Ston 01.jpgChurch of St. Blaise File:Pogled s Velikog Kaštia.jpgView from the Fort of Kaštio == References == ==Sources== *Ćosić, Stjepan. “The Nobility of the Episcopal Town of Ston (Nobilitas civitatis episcopalis Stagnensis) Dubrovnik Annals, Vol. No. 5, 2001. *Gudelj, Krešimira. “Coastal toponymy of the Ston region,” Folia onomastica Croatica, Vol. No. 20, 2011Melita Peharda, Mirjana Hrs-Brenko, Danijela Bogner, “Diversity of bivalve species in Mali Ston Bay, Adriatic Sea,\\" Acta Adriatica, Vol. 45 No. 2, 2004. *Lupis, Vinicije B. , “Mediaeval crucifixes from Ston and its surrounding area,” Starohrvatska prosvjeta, Vol. III No. 38, 2011. *Miović, Vesna. \\"Emin (Customs Officer) as Representative of the Ottoman Empire in the Republic of Dubrovnik,\\" Dubrovnik Annals 7 (2003): pp. 81–88. *Tomšić, Sanja, and Josip Lovrić. “Historical overview of oyster culture in Mali Ston Bay,” Naše more, Znanstveno-stručni časopis za more i pomorstvo, Vol. 51 No. 1-2, 2004. *Andrej Žmegač. “The Ston Fortification Complex - Several Issues,” Prilozi povijesti umjetnosti u Dalmaciji, Vol. 39 No. 1, 2005 * ==External links== *Ston - Geographical info Category:Populated places in Dubrovnik-Neretva County Category:Municipalities of Croatia Category:Populated coastal places in Croatia ","title":"Ston"},{"id":"515639","text":"Rāhu (Sanskrit: राहु)(16px) is one of the nine major astronomical bodies (navagraha) in Hindu texts. Unlike most of the others, Rahu is a shadow entity, one that causes eclipses and is the king of meteors. Rahu represents the ascension of the moon in its precessional orbit around the earth. Rahu is usually paired with Ketu which is also considered to be a shadow planet. The time of day considered to be under the influence of Rahu is called Rāhu kāla and is considered inauspicious. As per Hindu astrology Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other orbitally (as well as in the birth charts). This coincides with the precessional orbit of moon or the ~18 year rotational cycle of the lunar ascending and descending nodes on the earth's ecliptic plane. This also corresponds to a saros, a period of approximately 223 synodic months (approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours), that can be used to predict eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Rahu rules the zodiac sign of Aquarius together with Shani. Astronomically, Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes. The fact that eclipses occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points gives rise to the understanding of swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the snake. Rahu is responsible for causing the Eclipse of the Sun. == Legends == Rahu is found in the Puranic texts. The tales begin in the \\"remotest periods of prehistoric time, when the gods and asuras churned the Milk Ocean to extract from it the Amrita, the elixir of immortality.\\"Heinrich Zimmer, Myth and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilisation. New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1946, p. 176 Rāhu was present at that time and overcome with pride. Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, started distributing Amrit to the Devtaas. However, one Danav, Svarbhanu, sat in the row of devtaas and drank the Amrit. The Sun God and the Moon God noticed him and they informed Mohini; however, by that time Svarbhanu, had already became immortal. Vishnu as Mohini cut off Svarbhanu's head with Sudarshan Chakra. Rahuketu could not die but his head was separated from his body and his head came to be known as Rahu, while his body came to be known as Ketu. Following this event, Rahu and Ketu were given the responsibility to influence the lives of the humans on Earth. == Astrology == In Hindu Astrology Rahu represents materialism, mischief, fear, insatisfaction, obsession and confusion. Rahu is also associated with politicians and occult sciences. Like Ketu, Rahu is also an enemy against the sun and moon. It is generally considered as a malefic planet in astrology. == Buddhist Culture == Rāhu is mentioned explicitly in a pair of scriptures from the Samyutta Nikaya of the Pali Canon. In the Candima Sutta and the Suriya Sutta, Rahu attacks Surya, the Sun deity and Chandra, the Moon deity before being compelled to release them by their recitation of a brief stanza conveying their reverence for the Buddha.Candima SuttaSuriya Sutta The Buddha responds by enjoining Rāhu to release them, which Rāhu does rather than have his \\"head split into seven pieces\\". The verses recited by the two celestial deities and the Buddha have since been incorporated into Buddhist liturgy as protective verses recited by monks as prayers of protection.Access to Insight; see the summary in the Devaputta-samyutta section == Gallery == File:God Vishnu cut the head of Rahu with disk.jpgVishnu beheading Svarbhānu with his Sudarshana chakra File:Pharahu in Thailand.JPGPhra Rahu in Thailand File:Cambodia Rahu.pngRahu iconography in Cambodia ==See also== *Ketu *Kirtimukha *Svarbhanu *Saros ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:Asura Category:Danavas Category:Navagraha Category:Planetary deities Category:Sun myths Category:Moon myths Category:Eclipses Category:History of astrology ","title":"Rahu"},{"id":"515644","text":"Austrian Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof VfGH), the oldest constitutional court in the world, resided in the building of the former Böhmische Hofkanzlei (), Judenplatz 11 in Vienna until 2012. Hall for plenary sessions of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic in the building of the former Moravian Parliament in Brno Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVerfG) in Karlsruhe A constitutional court is a high court that deals primarily with constitutional law. Its main authority is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e. whether they conflict with constitutionally established rules, rights, and freedoms, among other things. In 1919 the First Austrian Republic established the first dedicated constitutional court, the Constitutional Court of Austria, which however existed in name only until 10 October 1920, when the country's new constitution came into effect, upon which the court gained the power to review the laws of Austria's federal states.Constitutional Court of Austria - History The Czechoslovakian Constitution of 1920, which came into effect on 2 February 1920, was the first to provide for a dedicated court for judicial review of parliamentary laws, but the court did not convene until November 1921. The organization and competences of both courts were influenced by constitutional theories of Hans Kelsen.Romeu F.R., The Establishment of Constitutional Courts: A Study of 128 Democratic Constitutions, „Review of Law & Economics”, 2 (1), Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2006, p. 104. The list in this article is of 63 countries that have a separate constitutional court. Many countries do not have separate constitutional courts, but instead delegate constitutional judicial authority to their general court system, with the final decision- making power resting in the supreme court. Nonetheless, such courts are sometimes also called \\"constitutional courts\\". For example, the Supreme Court of the United States has been called the world's oldest constitutional court because it was one of the earliest courts in the world to invalidate a law as unconstitutional (Marbury v. Madison), even though it is not a separate constitutional court, hearing as it does cases not touching on the Constitution. Prior to 1919, the United States, Canada and Australia had adopted the concept of judicial review by their courts following shared principles of their similar common law legal systems, which they, in turn, had inherited from British legal practice. (The United Kingdom itself does not have a codified constitution to be reviewed by such a court.) The Parthenopean Republic constitution of 1799, written by Mario Pagano, envisaged such a body (\\"eforato\\"), but lasted only 6 months.Mauro Lenci, The battle over \\"democracy\\".

The character first appears as a date for Frasier Crane, though mutual hostility and discomfort causes the evening to end badly. Several months later, Lilith meets Frasier again and, with some help from Frasier's ex- fiancée, Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), they start a romantic relationship, eventually living together, marrying, and having a son, Frederick. In the final season of Cheers, Lilith has an affair with another man and leaves Frasier. The affair later unravels and Lilith returns, seeking reconciliation with Frasier. Although Cheers ended ambiguously with regard to Frasier and Lilith's marriage, at the beginning of the spin-off series Frasier, their divorce had been finalized, with Lilith gaining custody of Frederick and remaining in Boston while Frasier has moved back to his hometown of Seattle. Lilith occasionally appears in Frasier, sometimes with Frederick. ==Role in Cheers== Lilith first appears in the Cheers episode, \\"Second Time Around\\" (1986), as Frasier Crane's (Kelsey Grammer) date. In the episode, their first date does not go well. Lilith walks out of the date because she disdains the bar as Frasier's location for their date and Frasier's activities at the bar. In \\"Abnormal Psychology\\" (1986), they feel mutual attraction again when he becomes accustomed to her makeover done by Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). At first reluctant to start over again, they then decide to go for another date. For years they live together since, as first shown in \\"Dinner at Eight-ish\\" (1987). \\"Our Hourly Bread\\" (1988) reveals that they wed one month before the episode. (In \\"Smotherly Love\\" (1992), they re-enact their wedding to please Lilith's mother Betty (Marilyn Cooper), who was irritated that she had not been present for their marriage.) In \\"The Stork Brings a Crane\\" (1989), Lilith gives birth to Frederick during the taxi ride home after false labor in the hospital. The tenth-season Cheers episode \\"I'm Okay, You're Defective\\" (1991) features two plots: one subplot about Lilith pressuring Frasier to finalize his will and one main plot about Sam Malone's (Ted Danson) concern that his sperm count may be low. The episode's epilogue is described as \\"Many years later\\" with an elderly Lilith and adult Frederick (Rob Neukirch) sitting for the reading of Frasier's will. The lawyer opens the sealed envelope and is surprised to find Sam's sperm count report, which turns out stable. In response to the mix-up, Lilith bitterly remarks, \\"That damn bar.\\" In the eleventh and final season (1992–93), in \\"Teaching with the Enemy\\" (1992), Lilith admits her affair with another man – Dr. Louis Pascal (Peter Vogt). In \\"The Girl in the Plastic Bubble\\" (1992), Lilith leaves Frasier, with him contemplating suicide until she promises to him that the marriage can be saved, to live with Pascal in Pascal's experimental underground eco-pod. In \\"Is There a Doctor in the Howe?\\" (1993), a depressed Frasier almost has sex with Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) in their bed until Lilith unexpectedly returns. In the following episode, \\"The Bar Manager, The Shrink, His Wife and Her Lover\\" (1993), Lilith storms out of the room to go to Cheers, demanding the others tell her how long Frasier and Rebecca have been having an affair. The other characters have no idea as the affair has barely started that very evening. Lilith reveals that the eco-pod experiment with Pascal was a disaster — Pascal turned out to be claustrophobic, among other mental problems — and she abandons the project to return to Boston. Frasier and Rebecca, and eventually Pascal, converge on Cheers in pursuit of Lilith. Pascal, armed with a pistol, demands Lilith return to him, threatening to shoot Frasier and the others. Lilith demands that he shoot her first, which causes him to back down and surrender to police. Although Frasier initially refuses to take Lilith back, her pathetic sobbing wins him over, suggesting a reconciliation can occur. ==Role in Frasier== In the spin-off Frasier, however, Lilith and Frasier turn out to have been divorced. Furthermore, Lilith has custody of Frederick. In the opening scene of the 1993 pilot episode of Frasier (\\"The Good Son\\"), Frasier is hosting his call-in radio show and relates the following: > Six months ago, I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very > painful. Then she came back to me, which was excruciating. ... so I ended > the marriage once and for all, packed up my things, and moved back here to > my home town of Seattle. Actress Bebe Neuwirth reprises the role of Lilith in several episodes of Frasier. In her debut Frasier episode, \\"The Show Where Lilith Comes Back\\" (1994), Lilith calls Frasier during his radio show, which surprises him, and mocks Frasier's psychiatric advice to his callers, especially one who overeats and whom Lilith attempts to help. Later at his apartment, Lilith reminds him about their times together during marriage. They make love at one point, but end up regretting it, strongly indicating no chance of a lasting reconciliation. Throughout the series, Lilith reappears on occasion, often rekindling hers and Frasier's lingering emotional bond, sometimes over concern about the future of Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also makes recurring appearances. A running gag throughout Frasier is that Frasier's father and brother, Martin Crane (John Mahoney) and Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce), are never pleased to see Lilith. Martin finds her \\"weird\\" and usually shouts out in shock when he unexpectedly sees her in his and Frasier's apartment. Niles resents her for mocking the vows at his wedding but forgives her when she apologizes. Lilith's presence frightens Martin's dog Eddie, terrifying the normally defiant dog into obedience. Martin's live-in physical therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), who fancies herself as having minor psychic abilities, routinely suffers debilitating headaches when Lilith is in town, citing an evil spiritual presence. Lilith marries her fiancé Brian (James Morrison), an MIT seismologist who appears in only one episode \\"Adventures in Paradise, Part Two\\" (1994). A later episode, \\"Room Service\\" (1998), reveals that Lilith is recently divorced from Brian after he came out of the closet. Her final Frasier episode is \\"Guns 'N Neuroses\\" (2003), where Lilith's colleague Nancy (Christine Dunford), sets Frasier up on a blind date with Lilith, having no idea of their mutual history. However, the two meet up for a drink while Lilith is in Seattle and, when it overruns, they both end up cancelling on the blind date (never learning they had been set up with each other). When the two are interrupted by a loud argument between a young married couple in the next room, Frasier and Lilith successfully resolve the couple's dispute, then spend the night together watching television and finally falling asleep together on the couch. The next morning, they part ways as loving friends without restarting their romance. ==Creation and development== The role of Lilith earned Bebe Neuwirth an Emmy as an Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1990 and 1991. A stereotypical \\"intelligent ice queen\\" Lilith Sternin was supposed to appear in one episode of the fourth season of Cheers, \\"Second Time Around\\" (1986). However, she was brought back in the fifth season and became a recurring character thereafter. Over the years, like Diane Chambers, an educated Lilith is often mocked yet \\"manages to put people in their place.\\" Cheers and Frasier writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found the chemistry of Frasier and Lilith \\"special\\" enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy mixed with \\"Prozac\\" and to comfortably write stories about. Nevertheless, Neuwirth viewed this role as detrimental to her acting talents and career, which motivated her into quitting Cheers in favor of mostly Broadway. However, she still recurringly appeared as Lilith in the spin-off Frasier. The Frasier episode \\"Wheels of Fortune\\" (2002) reveals that Lilith has a half-brother, Blaine (Michael Keaton), whom Frasier despises due to Blaine's relentless swindling. == Reception == This role earned Neuwirth two Emmy Awards as an Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1990 and 1991. According to an April 1–4, 1993, telephone survey of 1,011 people by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now Pew Research Center), before the Frasier premiere and the Cheers finale, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) was voted a favorite character by 26 percent, and Frasier Crane and Lilith Sternin were voted favorites by 1 percent each. In response to a question of spinning off a character, 15 percent voted Sam, 12 percent voted Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), 10 percent voted Norm Peterson (George Wendt), and 29 percent voted no spin-offs. Frasier Crane, whose own spin-off Frasier debuted in September 1993, was voted 2 percent to have his own show. Bill Simmons, who at the time worked for ESPN, deemed Lilith Sternin one of his least favorite Cheers characters. Nevertheless, Martha Nolan from The New York Times called Frasier and Lilith \\"repressed\\" when married together in Cheers. Josh Bell from About.com called Frasier and his ex-wife Lilith Sternin one of the \\"best sitcom divorced couples\\" of all-time. Steven H. Scheuer from Sarasota Herald-Tribune considered Lilith's significance to and marriage with Frasier \\"fun\\" to watch, especially when, in \\"Severe Crane Damage\\" (1990), she used comparisons between \\"the duller good boy\\" Frasier and \\"the interesting bad boy\\" Sam Malone as \\"psychiatric examples of the good boy-bad boy syndrome\\". Faye Zuckerman and John Martin from The New York Times called their marriage in Cheers a hilariously \\"[perfect mismatch]\\". Television critic Kevin McDonough from New York praised Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth's performances as \\"repressed individuals\\" and \\"separate couple on TV\\" with \\"acidic and hilarious\\" chemistry together. ==References Bibliography === *Bjorklund, Dennis A.

The National Governors Association states that he is the only person \\"to have occupied the highest seat in the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government\\" in Colorado. ==Early life and education== Born on February 2, 1889, in Ouray, Colorado, he was the son of John F. Knous of Pennsylvania Dutch descent. His mother, Julia Bain, was of Irish and Scottish ancestry. Both parents descended from men who fought in the Revolutionary War. In the early 1870s, John Knous moved from Iowa to Colorado, where he worked as a wagon boss and freighter that hauled supplies for the mining industry in Leadville. In Ouray, he drove a stagecoach between Ouray and Silverton. He also mined and prospected before becoming the town marshal and undersheriff. As a boy, William Knous began a lifelong interest in fishing and hunting. He graduated from Ouray High School, where he was the class valedictorian. He began working in the mines because it paid well. He played semi-pro baseball and entered local boxing matches, from which he earned money for college. Knous received a Bachelor of Law degree with honors in 1911 from the University of Colorado Law School. He was admitted to the bar in Colorado in 1911. ==Career== Knous entered private practice first in Ouray from 1911 to 1916, when he had fewer clients due to an economic downturn in the mining industry. He was a deputy district attorney for Ouray County, Colorado from 1913 to 1918, except a portion of one year from 1916 to 1917 when he wrote for legal publications in Rochester, New York. Realizing his preference to live in the Rocky Mountains, he returned to Colorado. He then worked with the Moynihan-Hughes-Knous law firm in Montrose, where he became a mining and irrigation legal expert. He was the Mayor of Montrose, Colorado from 1926 to 1930. He was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1928 to 1930. A western conservative, he was interested in issues faced by cattle ranchers and water rights. While in Montrose, he was the Chamber of Commerce president and city attorney. He was in private practice in Denver, Colorado to 1937. He was a member of the Colorado Senate from 1930 to 1936, serving as President pro Tem from 1935 to 1936. He was a Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court from 1937 to 1947, serving as Chief Justice from 1946 to 1947. He helped solve a major oil workers' strike and other national issues when he served on the national War Labor Board during World War II. He was the 31st Governor of Colorado from 1947 to 1950. Under his administration, a bill was enacted to combat specific diseases and public health units were established. Support was increased for workmen's compensation and schools. The state system of accounts and controls was improved, and the general fund for the state increased to a significant surplus. Knous was nominated by President Harry S. Truman on March 1, 1950 to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Colorado vacated by Judge John Foster Symes. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4, 1950, and received his commission on April 7, 1950. He served as Chief Judge from 1954 to 1959. His service terminated on December 12, 1959, due to his death. ==Personal life== He eloped with Elsie Marie Grabow, a friend of his sister and a teacher, in 1916. They had three sons, all of whom fought in World War II. * Robert Knous was a state senator and lieutenant governor of Colorado * Merle Knous was a state district judge * William Knous was a district attorney in Montrose He died of a heart attack on December 12, 1959 and was buried at Fairmount Cemetery. ==References== ==External links== * \\"The History of William Lee Knous\\" (video) * Knous, William Lee, 1889-1959, Harry S.

Clavin, Jr. (born 1947 or 1949), is a fictional character on the American television show Cheers played by John Ratzenberger. A postal worker, he is the bar's know-it-all and was a contestant on the game show Jeopardy! Cliff was not originally scripted in the series' pilot episode, \\"Give Me a Ring Sometime\\", but the producers decided to add a know-it-all character and Ratzenberger helped flesh it out. The actor made guest appearances as Cliff on The Tortellis, St. Elsewhere, Wings, and Frasier. == Development  Creation === The original script for the 1982 pilot, \\"Give Me A Ring Sometime\\", did not include Norm Peterson or Cliff Clavin. George Wendt and John Ratzenberger originally auditioned for a minor character, George, and George Wendt was hired for that role.Wendt, p. 112.Wendt, pp. 113–114. John Ratzenberger auditioned for the role George, as well. George was Diane Chambers' first customer, had one line (consisting of the order, \\"Beer!\\") and was intended for only one episode. Ratzenberger at the 1992 Emmy Awards Since Wendt was cast as George (who evolved into Norm Peterson), Ratzenberger suggested to the producers that a know-it-all character should be added; this led to the creation of Cliff Clavin. Ratzenberger based his role on a police officer in his hometown of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Cliff was originally a security guard, but two days before the pilot's filming he was changed to a postman; the producers thought a postman would be more knowledgeable than a guard. Ratzenberger agreed to seven episodes of the first season, but his role expanded. Stephen Tobolowsky told SplitSider.com that he had auditioned for Cliff. ===Other appearances=== On the Cheers 200th-episode special, host John McLaughlin asked Ratzenberger about Cliff Clavin. The actor replied that Cliff would describe himself as the \\"wingnut that holds Western civilization together\\"; however, Ratzenberger said he would describe Cliff simply as \\"a winged nut\\". When McLaughlin asked Ratzenberger if there was any part of him in Cliff, the actor replied that although he was interested in fascinating facts, the only part of Cliff in him was that they both wear white socks. Cliff appeared in 273 episodes of Cheers between 1982 and 1993. He also made guest appearances as an animated character (voiced by Ratzenberger) in The Simpsons episode \\"Fear of Flying\\", in The Tortellis episode \\"Frankie Comes to Dinner, in the Wings episode \\"The Story of Joe\\" and the Frasier episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\". In 2014, Ratzenberger reprised his role as Cliff in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial \\"The '80s Called\\". ==Role== Cliff is a postal worker, and Norm Peterson's best friend. He lives with his mother, Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen)—first in his childhood two-story house (which was bulldozed in 1987's \\"The Last Angry Mailman\\" after Esther sold it to a convenience-store builder), and then in a condominium (which first appears in the season 6 episode \\"My Fair Clavin\\") with a sofabed. He is ridiculed by friends and enemies alike, including Carla (Rhea Perlman) and Norm, for his know-it-all attitude. He appears on Jeopardy! in the season- eight episode, \\"What Is... Cliff Clavin?\\" (1990). The postman wins $22,000 in the first two rounds with questions that favor him, but loses it all with a wrong answer in Final Jeopardy (launching into a tirade which frightens host Alex Trebek). Cliff has a few relationships (mostly short-lived and hopeless) with women. Then he has a relationship with fellow postal worker Margaret O'Keefe (Annie Golden), which begins during Cheers seventh season (1988–89). When Margaret becomes pregnant with another man's child in 1993's \\"Do Not Forsake Me O My Postman\\", Cliff stays by her side as the baby's stepfather before Margaret returns to the child's biological father. In \\"The Barstoolie\\" (1985) Cliff meets his father, Cliff Clavin Sr. (Dick O'Neill), who left Cliff and his mother years earlier when Cliff was still a child. Cliff later realizes that his father is a fraudster and a fugitive from justice, and will run off again. Cliff does not want to turn his father in; Cliff Sr. disappears, leaving his son devastated. In the 1993 series finale, Cliff finally receives a promotion. In \\"The Show Where Sam Shows Up\\" (1995), an episode of the Cheers spinoff Frasier, Sam (Ted Danson) tells Frasier that Cliff has not left home since he read an article about flesh-eating bacteria; however, Sam then discovers that Cliff is one of the other men with whom Sam's fiance Sheila (Téa Leoni) had had sex. In another Frasier episode, \\"The Show Where Woody Shows Up\\", Woody tells Frasier that Cliff almost married a mail- order bride, but she decided to go back to Bosnia after spending a few days with him. In another Frasier episode, \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\", Cliff has his retirement party at the airport bar; he had planned to move to Florida, but decides to stay in Boston (to Carla's dismay). == Reception == On the NBC News website, Wendall Wittler called Cliff a \\"classic\\" character; however, Wittler found his friendship with Norm Peterson \\"superficial\\" and unworthy of comparison with the relationship between Ralph Kramden (Jackie Gleason) and Ed Norton (Art Carney) on The Honeymooners. According to an April 1–4, 1993 telephone survey of 1,011 people by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now the Pew Research Center), Sam Malone was voted a \\"favorite character\\" by twenty-six percent of respondents and Cliff Clavin by two percent.Mills, Kim I. \\"TV viewers glad Sam stayed single.\\" The Sunday Gazette [Schenectady, NY] May 2, 1993: A3.

May 11, 2012. == Lawsuit == In 1993, Ratzenberger and Wendt sued Host International for copyright infringement, trademark infringement and violating the actors' personality rights. The company operated airport lounges styled similarly to Cheers which included two robots, one heavyset and the other a postal worker, which the actors claimed resembled Cliff Clavin and Norm Peterson. The lawsuit was declined at its first and second hearings. At the first, the judge ruled that the defendant did not violate copyright because Paramount Pictures had already granted it a license to produce Cheers-based bars. At the second, the judge ruled that the robots did not resemble the characters. In 1997, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed both rulings on the grounds that Paramount's copyright claim might not have more weight than Ratzenberger and Wendt's ownership of publicity and that the resemblance claim should be decided by a jury, not a judge. No. 96-55243. The case resulted in an undisclosed 2001 settlement by Host International. ==Notes== ;Footnotes ;Inline citations === References === *Wendt, George. Drinking with George.

It breeds in the Pribilof Islands, Bogoslof Island and Buldir Island in the Bering Sea off the coast of Alaska, and the Commander Islands, Russia and spends the winter at sea. ==Description== Red-legged kittiwake parent and chick. The red-legged kittiwake is a very localised subarctic Pacific species. Apart from the distinguishing feature implicit in its name, it is very similar to its better known relative, the black-legged kittiwake; other differences include the shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head and darker grey wings, and in the juveniles, which barely differ from the adults, lacking the black tail band and 'W' across the wings of juvenile black-legged kittiwakes. Juveniles take three years to reach maturity. Adults are long, with an wingspan and a body mass of .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . Like the Pacific race of black-legged kittiwake, the red-legged kittiwake has a well-developed hind toe. As occasional individual black-legged kittiwakes have reddish legs, any reports of red-legged away from the subarctic Pacific must record all of the other differences, not just the leg colour, for acceptance by bird recording authorities. ==Behavior== The red-legged kittiwake feeds on fish such as lanternfish (Myctophidae), squid and invertebrates. It spends the summer at the cliff breeding colonies, nesting on ledges, and migrates out to sea in September to overwinter in the north western Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Alaska. ==Status== This species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the IUCN as its population appears to be in decline. It has a global population in the region of 337,000 to 377,000 mature individuals and its breeding range is . Its numbers are thought to have decreased by about 35% between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s though numbers may have stabilized since. It is unclear why they have declined, but it may be related to a change in the availability of prey, possibly associated excessive commercial fishing or with climate change. ==Gallery== Image:Rlegkittiwake6.jpgRed-legged kittiwake Image:Red-legged Kittiwake RWD1.jpgAlaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska Image:Red-legged Kittiwake RWD3.jpgAlaska SeaLife Center in Seward, Alaska Image:Rissa brevirostris7.jpgRed-legged kittiwake chick Image:Red-legged Kittiwake colony, St. George Island, Alaska.jpgRed-legged kittiwake colony, St. George Island, Alaska ==References== * Harrison, Peter (1988).

In an old and broad sense of the term, it is any nephropathy, but in current usage the term is usually restricted to a narrower sense of nephropathy without inflammation or neoplasia, in which sense it is distinguished from nephritis, which involves inflammation. It is also defined as any purely degenerative disease of the renal tubules. Nephrosis is characterized by a set of signs called the nephrotic syndrome. Nephrosis can be a primary disorder or can be secondary to another disorder. Nephrotic complications of another disorder can coexist with nephritic complications.

He was integral in the founding of the Universal Postal Union in 1874, and in 1877 introduced the telephone to Germany. ==Biography== Stephan was born in Stolp (Słupsk), Pomerania, in the Kingdom of Prussia. He began his career as a local postal clerk in the service of the Prussian post in 1849. In 1866 he was put in charge by the Prussian government of federalizing the postal service that had long been privately run by the noble Thurn und Taxis family. In 1870 he was named director of postal services for the North German Confederation. Stephan's career then moved quickly up the ranks, as he was named Postmaster General of the German Empire in 1876, the Undersecretary of State in charge of the post office in 1880, and the Minister of Postal Services for Germany in 1895. When Stephan began his work as a postal worker, Germany was divided into 17 independent states, each with its own separate policies and fees. He worked early on to establish a uniform postage rate throughout Germany, to facilitate easier mailing. His general goal of standardization and internationalization is evident in his work to combine the postal service with the telegraph service in Germany, and in his efforts to organize the International Postal Conference in Bern in 1874, in which the Universal Postal Union was established. He introduced the postcard (which he had initially suggested in 1865) to Germany after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck promoted him in 1870: the postcard came into widespread use in the subsequent Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 as a method of communication between units in the field. He is also credited with having introduced the telephone to Germany.Huurdeman, Anton A. (2003) The Worldwide History of Telecommunications Wiley-IEEE, New York, pages 169-171, Stephan died in 1897 in Berlin, having made a profound impact on the standardization of mail service worldwide. He was also actively engaged in cultivating purely Germanic terminology for the field of telecommunication and postal services. The German-speaking afterworld thus gained terms such as \\"Fernsprechapparat\\" (distance-speaking-device) for telephone, \\"Wertzeichen\\" (value-sign) for stamp, \\"postlagernd\\" (post-office-stored) for poste restante and \\"Anschrift\\" (towards-lettering, analogous to \\"Ansprache\\" or \\"Anrede\\" for addressing a person or a salutation) for address. The word creations mandated by von Stephan in the 1870s gained circulation at post offices and among its workforce, but many times the Greek or French original term was retained by German speakers. Thus at home people would say \\"frankieren\\" for putting stamps on a postcard or letter envelope (Briefumschlag) among themselves, but switch to \\"freimachen\\" (absolve from stamp-debt, thus permitting delivery) when at the post office. Or at home they would say \\"Telefon\\" in everyday speech, although the arcane official term was \\"Fernsprecher\\" (remote speaker) or Fernsprechapparat. His achievements in the field of postal services far outweigh this pedantic purism and it was his proposal to have the Siemens company manufacture telephones which led to the development of an entirely new business segment for the famous German company in 1878.

The series ran on NBC from September 26, 2002 to December 18, 2003, and centered around the personal and professional life of Jake (Mark Feuerstein), the executive producer of an incredibly low-rated morning show in Miami. The series was one of the first on NBC to be fully originated in high definition. The series was launched as a part of the network's highly-rated \\"Must See TV\\" lineup, where it struggled in the ratings when compared to other sitcoms in the lineup, such as Kohan and Mutchnick's own Will & Grace. Midway through the second season, NBC pulled the series after Kohan and Mutchnick sued the network. The series never returned, and the final nine episodes were ultimately left unaired. These episodes were later shown on TG4 in Ireland and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. ==Synopsis== Wunderkind producer Jake Silver decides to accept the job leading the lowest-rated morning show in Miami. He falls in love with the show's beautiful, down-to-earth hairdresser, Dylan. The carnival of clowns at the station includes pompous and insulting on-air host Gavin; Jake's sardonic assistant, Penny; and highly insecure station manager, Frank. Early in the first season, Gavin's morning co-host was Lucia, and Sister Brenda was the station's nun/weather-girl. Eventually, Jake's foul- mouthed grandmother, Claire, becomes the on-screen co-host. Both Lucia and Sister Brenda were written out early in the series as the producers were still searching for the \\"center\\" of their program. During the second season, Jake and Dylan begin a relationship, almost even deciding on a relocation to New York together. Victoria Hill, a new station boss, took over the show to get higher ratings, and Gavin struggled to warm up to her. A new weather girl, Joni, was also introduced. The series ended with Gavin and Penny deciding to start a relationship (as Penny is pregnant with his baby), Frank marrying Gavin's mother as a publicity stunt, and Jake and Dylan agreeing to go their separate ways (Jake leaves the station and goes to produce at NBC in Manhattan, while Dylan returns to her home state of Omaha, Nebraska). ==Cast and charactersMain=== * Mark Feuerstein - Jake Silver * Ashley Williams as Dylan Messinger * Matt Letscher - Gavin Stone * Constance Zimmer - Penelope \\"Penny\\" Barnes Barrington * Jere Burns as Frank Jennifer Alfano * Tessie Santiago as Lucia Rojas-Klein, Gavin's morning co-host (episodes 1-11) * Brooke Dillman as Sister Brenda Trogman, a nun who is also the station's weather girl (episodes 1-11) * Suzanne Pleshette as Claire Arnold, Jake's grandmother (season 1) ===Recurring=== * Stephon Fuller as Robby * Tiffani Thiessen as Victoria Hill, a new station boss in season two * Jillian Barberie as Joni, the station's new weather girl in season two * Bob Clendenin as Carl, a station camera man * Tracy Vilar as Stacey * Edward James Gage as Tiny, the station helicopter pilot ==Production== The sitcom was filmed at CBS Studio Center's Stage 16 The theme song, entitled \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", is played by John Rzeznik of the Goo Goo Dolls.

The part of Penny was played by an uncredited actress and the character was completely different. ==Episodes== During the original run of the series, the first episodes were broadcast out of intended production order by NBC and they could not manage to program the inventory of episodes onto the schedule properly. First, completely discarding the episode titled, \\"It Didn't Happen One Night,\\" then failing to run the Christmas themed episode until the second week of January, after first running another new episode during the first week of January. Despite renewing the series, only half of the second season was ever broadcast in the United States by NBC. The entire series was aired on TG4 in Ireland several times in a daily morning time slot.

She has sold over 20 million records worldwide as of September 2017Broadway World (2017). \\"Lara Fabian annule finalement sa tournée\\", Le Figaro\\"Showcase exclusif de Lara Fabian\\". Bel RTL. and is one of the best-selling Belgian artists of all time. She was born in Etterbeek, Brussels to a Belgian father and a Sicilian mother. Since 1996 she has held Canadian citizenship alongside her original Belgian citizenship. As of 2015 she lived in Walloon Brabant province in Belgium just outside Brussels. She has since moved back to Montreal. ==Early life== Fabian is the only child of Pierre Crokaert, who is Flemish, and Maria Luisa Serio, a Sicilian. Fabian’s parents recognized her talents early on and enrolled her in the Royal Conservatory of Brussels when she was eight. She sings in seven languages: French, English, Spanish, Italian, Flemish, German and Russian. ==Music career1986–1993: Early music career=== During the 1980s, Fabian entered a number of European competitions and won several prizes. She released her first single, \\"L'Aziza est en pleurs\\" / \\"Il y avait\\" in 1986. In 1988, the RTL TV channel in Luxembourg invited Fabian to represent the country at the 33rd Eurovision Song Contest, held that year in Dublin, Ireland. The song was a composition by Jacques Cardona and Alain Garcia entitled Croire (Belief) which reached a respectable fourth place (while Celine Dion won the contest representing Switzerland). The single became a hit in Europe, selling nearly 500,000 copies. In 1990, Fabian and musical collaborator Rick Allison moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada to embark on a career in North America. They started their own music label and publishing company, Productions Clandestines. In August 1991, her self-titled French-language debut album, Lara Fabian, was released in Canada and sold over 100,000 copies. The album went gold in 1993, and platinum the following year. The success of upbeat Dance-pop singles such as \\"Le jour où tu partira\\", \\"Les murs\\", and \\"Qui pense à l'amour\\" gave Fabian radio exposure. She received several nominations at the 1993 ADISQ awards, and a poll published around that time voted her Québec's most promising singer. ===1994–1996: Breakthrough album: Carpe diem=== Constant touring in Québec helped Fabian's 1994 album Carpe diem become her breakthrough album. The album went Gold three weeks after its release, and spawned three hit singles: \\"Tu t'en vas\\", \\"Si tu m'aimes\\", and \\"Leïla\\". The following year, the album went triple platinum. Fabian received two Félix awards at the 1995 ADISQ gala: Best Show Of The Year and Best Female Singer Of The Year (a category that is voted for by the public). In 1996, Walt Disney Studios hired Fabian as the voice of the character of Esmeralda in the Canadian French version of the animated feature The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney also included \\"Que Dieu aide les exclus\\", Fabian's French version of the song \\"God Help The Outcasts\\", on the film's English soundtrack album alongside Bette Midler's version. Since 1996 Lara Fabian has also held Canadian citizenship alongside her original Belgian passport. ===1997–1999: Mainstream international success: Pure and Live=== After the success of Carpe diem, Fabian signed a contract with the French Polydor label for several albums and Pure was released in June 1997. Pure sold more than two million copies in France; the album went platinum in less than two weeks, and spawned several hit singles: \\"Tout\\", \\"Je t'aime\\", \\"Humana\\", each of which sold more than a million copies, and the anti-homophobia anthem \\"La Différence\\". The album won a Félix for Popular Album of the Year at the 1997 ADISQ gala and was nominated for two Juno Awards in the Best Selling French Album category, and for Fabian as Best Female Singer. In February 1998, Fabian received the Discovery of the Year award during the Victoires de la Musique Gala. Also in 1998, Polydor released Carpe diem in Europe. In November 1998, she received the Félix Award for Artist with the Most Recognition Outside Quebec at the 'ADISQ Gala'. In December, she was named as Revelation of the Year by Paris Match, which put her on its cover to mark this occasion. In March 1999, Fabian released her first live album, named Live, which debuted at #1 on the French charts. This helped seal an international recording contract with Sony Music. In May 1999, Fabian was honoured at the World Music Awards in Monaco, where she received Best Selling Record for the Year 1998 for her album Pure. In July 1999, with over six million records already sold across Europe, Polydor rereleased Fabian's self-titled debut album. ===1999–2001: Extension of success to the US and Latin America: Lara Fabian=== In the summer of 1999, Fabian recorded her first English-language album, Lara Fabian, in New York and San Francisco for the Sony label. The songs were written and produced with Rick Allison and Dave Pickell, Walter Afanasieff, Glen Ballard and Patrick Leonard. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 'Heatseekers' album chart, reached #1 on the French album chart and #2 on the Belgian album chart. For the Asian version of the album, Fabian collaborated with American-Taiwanese pop star Leehom Wang on the song \\"Light of My Life\\". The dance-pop song \\"I Will Love Again\\", her first English single, reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play, and peaked #32 on the Billboard Hot 100, #10 Adult Contemporary, as well as appearing in several international charts. This included the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #63. The follow-up ballad, \\"Love By Grace\\", entered the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at #24. In February 2001, \\"Love By Grace\\" became the theme song of the lead couple in the Brazilian soap opera Laços de Família, broadcast by TV Globo in Brazil and Portugal. For several weeks, the song was number 1 on most Brazilian and Portuguese radio stations. The third single, the dance-pop song \\"I Am Who I Am\\", remixed by Hex Hector, did not chart. In Europe, the single \\"Adagio\\" charted at #5 on the French singles chart and #3 on the Belgian singles chart. During this period, Fabian recorded songs for several Hollywood motion picture soundtracks, including \\"The Dream Within\\" for the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within soundtrack, and \\"For Always\\" for the AI:Artificial Intelligence soundtrack, which contained both a solo version and a duet with Josh Groban. ===2001–2003: O Canada 2001 and return to French roots: Nue, Live 2002 and En toute intimité=== Nue (Naked), Fabian's fourth French album, was released in the Fall of 2001 in both Québec and France. Nue is a documentation of her emotional ride in the years since success of the previous album. The album reached #1 in Belgium and #2 in France but had little impact in Québec. The album was also released in Portugal and reached the top 10 on the album charts during the Fall of 2001. The first single, released in the summer of 2001, was the anthem \\"J'y crois encore\\" was a top 20 French hit. Other singles followed, including \\"Immortelle\\", \\"Aimer Déjà\\" and in 2002 \\"Tu es mon autre\\" (a duet with fellow Belgian, Maurane which was nominated for song of the year and reached the top 5 in France). Also in 2001, she collaborated with David Foster and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra to record the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, in an English version, a French version, and a bilingual (French/English) version, for a promotion of the Government of Canada. In 2002, Fabian contributed to the World Soccer Championship CD release, with the song World at Your Feet written and produced by Gary Barlow. Towards the end of 2002, Fabian released her second live album, Live 2002, from her latest tour, together with a DVD showcasing concerts recorded in December 2001 in Belgium at the Forest National and at Le Zénith in Paris. Her 2003 stint at the Casino de Paris every Monday night consisted of concerts to small audiences which were released as a live CD and DVD at the end of 2003, under the title En toute intimité. ===2004: Second English language release: A Wonderful Life=== In 2004, Fabian released her second English album, A Wonderful Life. The project was commercially unsuccessful but critically praised. The more organic sound on the album is attributed to the work of French guitarist Jean-Félix Lalanne, and producers Desmond Child, Anders Bagge and the British team True North (composed of Take That singer Gary Barlow and Elliot John Kennedy). \\"Review My Kisses\\", written by Desmond Child, was first recorded by LeAnn Rimes in 2002 for her album Twisted Angel. The first single released for radio was \\"The Last Goodbye\\" in the US and a number of other countries (except France). In France, the song \\"No Big Deal\\" was the first single. Neither of the songs achieved success and the album was not promoted; and its release was canceled in the United States. In Brazil, the song \\"I Guess I Loved You\\" achieved moderate success when included on a soap opera entitled \\"Senhora do Destino\\" (Her own Destiny), a well-known Brazilian television series. The song also gained some popularity in Portugal, for the same reason, though it was never officially released or promoted. ===2005–2006: A new musical direction: 9 and Un Regard 9=== After a sabbatical in 2004, Fabian returned to the music scene spring of 2005 with her fifth French album, 9. The album is performed in a new style, with smoothness, serenity and joy, a departure from the deep, dramatic style of earlier recordings. 9 yielded the hit single \\"La Lettre\\", a song co-written with her new partner, Jean-Félix Lalanne, with whom she produced the album's 11 tracks. Other singles released included \\"Ne lui parlez plus d'elle\\", \\"Un Ave Maria\\", \\"Il ne manquait que toi\\" and the gospel-infused \\"L'homme qui n'avait pas de maison\\". In October 2006, Fabian released a CD and DVD of this associated tour, both titled Un regard 9 Live and recorded during the concert of March 29, 2006, at Le Zénith in Paris. The CD presents 15 live performances and a new song, \\"Aime\\", recorded in a studio in Montreal, Quebec. ===2006–2007: An Italian collaboration and live concerts in Europe=== In June 2007 Fabian worked in Rome and Los Angeles to record tracks for her next studio album. In the meantime, the single \\"Un Cuore Malato\\" (with Gigi D'Alessio) reached the top of the Italian charts and #16 in France. In Los Angeles, Fabian worked with Dave Stewart on a multilingual album, reputed to include songs in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and a few other languages. This album was planned for release in late 2008. Also in 2007, Fabian was in Québec to perform a two night concert at the Olympia de Montreal. In October she was a surprise guest a concert Gigi D'Alessio gave in France at the Olympia in Paris. Soon after, her daughter was born. ===2009: Return to the music scene: Toutes les femmes en moi=== A few months after her daughter's birth, Fabian carried out a tour of Ukraine, Russia and Greece. She also made a few TV appearances (such as 60th Anniversary of Israel where Fabian performed a Hebrew song and duetted with Israeli singer Noa). During 2008, Fabian was in Belgium preparing to record a French album with pianist Mark Herskowitz. The album, Toutes les femmes en moi, was partly recorded in Montreal, and was released in May 2009. The first single, Soleil, Soleil, is a cover of the Nana Mouskouri song. The second single was Toutes les Femmes en moi, the only original song on the album. ===2010: \\"Tour Les Femmes Font Leur Show\\", Mademoiselle Zhivago=== Throughout the first half of 2010, Fabian embarked on a European tour of concerts, throughout France, Switzerland, and Belgium, incorporating the main repertoire of her last album \\"Toutes Les Femmes En Moi\\" along with some classic and fan favorites. She also performed again in Eastern Europe, with a more acoustic set (piano-voice), and included English recordings from the album Every Woman in Me. In September 2010, she finally released her 2009 album \\"Toutes Les Femmes En Moi\\" in Québec. She also recorded the album \\"Nuit Magique\\" with Canadian singer Coral Egan. Later in 2010, Fabian released a concept album in Russia and Ukraine called Mademoiselle Zhivago which has sold over 800.000 copies in Russia. It features 11 songs in different languages by Russian composer Igor Krutoy. It features stories about a woman who experiences several lives over the years and centuries. Eleven music videos, one each song, were combined to create a full- length film, produced and directed by Ukrainian film producer Alan Badoev. The album itself, containing a CD and a DVD, was first released in Ukraine in October 2010 and in Russia in November. The whole set of songs composed by Fabian with Igor Krutoy is in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. She first introduced one of these songs in 2009 during the New Wave Festival in Latvia, performing \\"Demain n'existe pas\\". Later, in 2010, she returned to that same stage performing new songs from the already finalized project. She has been promoting this project in both countries both on television and by performing a series of concerts presenting the new songs live to the eastern European public. She has since established herself as a superstar in Russia and Ukraine. Fabian was a guest performer on the show of October 30 of the Ukrainian X Factor, singing \\"Mademoiselle Hyde\\" and \\"Demain N'Existe Pas\\", taken from the album and also her longtime classic \\"Adagio\\". In 2012 she sang \\"Ma Solitude\\", a duet with Greek singer George Perris, on his album Un Souhait. ===2013: \\"Deux ils, Deux elles\\" and \\"Le Secret\\"=== Fabian released her new album Le Secret on April 15, 2013, which consists of 17 brand new songs. On the same day of the album release she showcased her new songs at the Théâtre de Paris. Her first single is \\"Deux ils, Deux elles\\", released February 20, 2013. The song talks about the love between two men and two women, speaks about tolerance and acceptance of the LGBT community – just like her previous song \\"La Différence\\". ===2014: \\"Make Me Yours Tonight\\" / \\"Al Götür Beni\\"=== Planned tour dates in early 2014 were cancelled and recording delayed while Fabian recovered from ear damage.\\"Malade, Lara Fabian annule sa tournée\\". Leparisien.fr, January 20, 2014.Legras, Sophie (January 20, 2014). \\"Lara Fabian annule finalement sa tournée\\", Le Figaro In August she released a duet with Turkish Artist Mustafa Ceceli. The title, \\"Make Me Yours Tonight\\" written by Anthony James and Yiorgos Bellapaisiotis was released as an EP in English and Turkish versions (\\"Al Götür Beni\\"), as well as in additional \\"acoustic\\" versions. Her first cooperation with Belgian-US label Odacity Records, the single reached the position 1 in physical single sales in Turkey, and position 2 in digital sales. Several remix versions of \\"Make Me Yours Tonight\\" have been released in April 2015, as part of a new \\"Best of..\\" album entitled \\"Selection\\" (released in 23 countries, and as an EP (released worldwide). The EP reached position 12 in the Dance Album charts of iTunes France, and position 5 in the iTunes Album Charts in Turkey (album \\"Selection\\") ===2015: Performer at the 65th Sanremo, Essential Lara Fabian and Greatest Hits Tour 2015 === On December 14, 2014, during L'Arena, broadcast on the Italian channel Rai 1, presenter Massimo Giletti and guest Carlo Conti revealed the names of the new performers at the 65th Sanremo Music Festival. Fabian was announced as being one of the 20 singers in the \\"Big\\" (main) category. It was the second time she has appeared on the Ariston stage (since her guest featuring in 2007 with Gigi D'Alessio) and the first time as a solo competitor. In several interviews, she dedicated her performance to her mother. Fabian called the song she decided to submit \\"A hymn to lightness, to enthusiasm\\". On the evening show on February 10, 2015, Fabian performed her new single \\"Voce\\" for the Italian market. It is to be included in a new greatest hits album, Essential Lara Fabian, specifically released in the country by Warner Italy. On the evening of February 12, 2015, a visibly moved Fabian sang on the same stage \\"Sto male\\", Ornella Vanoni's Italian version of her already popular rendition of \\"Je Suis Malade\\". This was the night of the Sanremo sub-competition for cover versions; she eventually lost to Nek and his \\"Se telefonando\\" formerly popularized by Mina. On the evening of February 13 she performed \\"Voce\\", once more, before losing the entire competition. She was already pending since the premiere. An article in the local San Remo Festival publication, \\"Farewell to foreigners at Sanremo\\", written by Erika Cannoletta, maintained that a lack of meritocracy and obscure political issues backstage had contributed to the reasons that led to the elimination of the artist. Before this, the Italian audience and press were generally rather cold towards Fabian, especially in relation to her fame in the country. In a fairly scathing and controversial article titled \\"Sanremo 2015, who is Lara Fabian? The international star whom nobody ever heard of\\", writer and music critic Michele Monina (of Il Fatto Quotidiano) questioned the fame, career and quality of the singer, generating a heated debate on its comment section. On February 15 she performed one last time on Domenica In, Rai 1, receiving a standing ovation. The singer will reprise her tour in support of her new release beginning from February 21, 2015 by performing at the Nokia Arena, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Israel. ===2015: \\"Ma vie dans la tienne\\"=== In November 2015, Lara released her 9th studio album, titled Ma vie dans la tienne (\\"My Life In Yours\\"), consisting of songs she co-wrote and co-composed with David Gategno and Elodie Hesme. The album, which was released under license by Warner Music France, included the singles \\"Quand je ne chante pas\\", \\"Ma vie dans la tienne\\", \\"L'oubli\\" and \\"Ton désir\\". The album was certified \\"Platinum\\" in France, Gold in Belgium, and has sold over 150,000 copies worldwide. ===2016–2018: Camouflage and world tour=== In 2016 Fabian began work on a new English album, her 13th studio album, planned for release in 2017 under the title Camouflage, with a Swedish-American music production team. The album consists of 12 titles and was available for pre-order on August 4, 2017. A first single, \\"Growing Wings\\", was released on the same date. The second single of the album was \\"Choose What You Love Most (And Let It Kill You).\\" The Camouflage World Tour started in Miami on February 2, 2018. She toured throughout the world, making 40 appearances, ending the tour in Paris, in June 2018. ===2018–Present: Papillon & World Tour=== In September 2018 Fabian announced the release of her new single, \\"Papillon\\". Written by Fabian, Moh Denebi and Sharon Vaughn. The single was released on October 5, 2018. It's the first single from her fourteenth album, also titled Papillon, released on February 8, 2019. To support the release of the album, Lara Fabian embarked upon the 50 World Tour with a concert in New York at the Beacon Theatre on September 16, 2019 before moving on to visit over 20 other locations across the USA, Russia and Europe. The tour celebrates her 50th birthday, three decades in the music industry and over 20 million copies sold of her 14 studio albums. ==Artistry== Fabian is a full lyric soprano with a vocal range that spans three octaves from C3 to G♯6 in live performances.Soto-Morettini, D, Popular Singing: A Practical Guide To: Pop, Jazz, Blues, Rock, Country and Gospel, p. 58. A & C Black, She is multilingual, in fact she speaks French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and English.

She also composed for Daniel Lévi and is said to be currently working with a former contestant from \\"Nouvelle Star 3\\", Roland. She has often praised the voice and talent of successful female singer Amel Bent, who was also a contestant on that show. She wrote \\"Dis-moi comment t'aimer\\" for Greek singer George Perris on his album Un Souhait. \\"Imaginer\\" was originally written in English, under the name 'Broken Vow', by Fabian and songwriter Walter Afanasieff. They rewrote the lyrics especially for Jackie Evancho, in French, for her album Dream with Me. The original meaning of the song, about a sad love, is completely changed in the French version to describe a dream of a beautiful world without war or hunger. ==Acting career== * 2004: in the MGM film De-Lovely the singer performed the numbers \\"Another Openin', Another Show\\" (with chorus) and \\"So in Love\\" (with Mario Frangoulis) from the Cole Porter musical Kiss Me, Kate. ==Personal life== Fabian and French singer Patrick Fiori began a relationship at the start of 1998. She was in a relationship with French director, producer, and composer Gérard Pullicino beginning in 2006, and has a daughter with him. Fabian married Sicilian musician and artist Gabriel Di Giorgio in 2013. ==See also== *List of number-one dance hits (United States) *List of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chart ==ReferencesBiography of Lara Fabian, from Radio France Internationale * Last.fm – Lara Fabian * English translations of Lara Fabian's songs Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Canadian singers Category:21st-century Canadian singers Category:Belgian emigrants to Canada Category:Belgian people of Sicilian descent Category:Canadian dance musicians Category:Canadian singer- songwriters Category:Canadian sopranos Category:Polydor Records artists Category:Warner Music France artists Category:French-language singers of Belgium Category:French-language singers of Canada Category:Italian-language singers Category:Portuguese-language singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Luxembourg Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1988 Category:Musicians from Brussels Category:People from Uccle Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada Category:Singers from Montreal Category:Spanish-language singers of Canada Category:World Music Awards winners Category:Singers with a three-octave vocal range Category:Opera crossover singers Category:Belgian female pop singers Category:Canadian female pop singers Category:Canadian people of Sicilian descent Category:20th-century Canadian women singers Category:21st-century Canadian women singers Category:21st-century Belgian singers ","title":"Lara Fabian"},{"id":"515698","text":"Sedgefield District was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district and (from 1996), Borough in County Durham, in North East England.

It has a capacity of over 600 pupils and spans two years of Nursery, six years of Junior School (primary school), a transition year of Senior Preparatory, and six years of Senior School (secondary school), comprising fifteen years in all. Kelvinside was founded as a private Public School and remained so until the late 1940s when, like many similar schools, it became 'grant-aided' until 1985 when it reverted to its fully independent roots once more. Formerly for boys only, the school became fully co-educational in 1998. ==The School== Kelvinside Academy is in the Kelvinside area of the north of Glasgow, near the Glasgow Botanic Gardens. It has a large main building, which is category A listed and was designed by James Sellars, with some modern additions. The original building was opened on 2 September 1878 and cost £21,698 11s; this included the construction of both roads and sewers. The School crest shows Minerva with the motto ΑΙΕΝ ΑΡΙΣΤΕΥΕΙΝ which translates as \\"Ever To Be The Best\\". This has also been given a \\"modern\\" translation of \\"The Best You Can Be\\". Minerva appears prominently in carved stone above the main entrance, and in a bronze medallion set in the perimeter wall. Unlike many of the surrounding buildings, the School retains much of its original cast iron fences despite the metal shortages during the Second World War. There is a well-established house system, which divides all the pupils into four different houses, each represented by a colour: red for Stewart House, yellow for Buchanan House, green for MacGregor House and blue for Colquhoun. The School opened a new Nursery at its Balgray Campus in August 2013. In 2018, Kelvinside merged with Craigholme School to form the Glasgow Schools Trust, which was created to share resources between both schools and preserve both schools due to falling pupil numbers. ==Notable alumni and staff== * John Joy Bell, journalist and author * Robert Browning, Byzantinist * Brigadier General John Charteris * Sir Hugh Fraser, 2nd Baronet, of the House of Fraser department store chain (1936–1987) * Douglas Gairdner, paediatrician * Richie Gray, Scottish International Rugby Union player currently playing for Toulouse * Brigadier Alastair Pearson, Parachute Regiment, DSO***, MCAlastair Pearson * Air Vice Marshal Sandy Johnstone * Boyd Muir, EVP & CFO, President of Operations, Universal Music Group * Ian Livingston, Baron Livingston of Parkhead * Sir George Macdonald, archaeologist, teacher at the school 1887–1892 * Sir Donald MacDougall, economist * Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry (1944–2011) * Craig Wright, cricketer. * Sandy Wylie, Lord Kinclaven, Judge of the Supreme Courts * Scott Cummings, Scottish International Rugby Union player currently playing for Glasgow Warriors ==Related publications== * Kelvinside Academy, 1878–1978 by Colin Mackay * Kelvinside Academy, 1878–1923 by William Brodie * Kelvinside Academy, 1878–1928 by David Morrice Low * Minerva, termly newsletter ==References== ==External links== * Kelvinside Academy * ISCis page for Kelvinside Academy * Friends Reunited page for Kelvinside Academy (registration required) * Kelvinside Academical Club * Kelvinside Academy's page on Scottish Schools Online ==Sources== * * * http://pmsa.courtauld.ac.uk/pmsa/GW/KS-002.htm * https://archive.is/20130421040234/http://www.schoolsguidebook.co.uk/schools/Kelvinside_Academy.html * Category:School buildings completed in 1878 Category:Category A listed buildings in Glasgow Category:Educational institutions established in 1878 Category:Member schools of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference Category:Independent schools in Glasgow Category:James Sellars buildings ","title":"Kelvinside Academy"},{"id":"515725","text":"Pokey, Poky or Pokie may refer to: ==In entertainment== * Pokey (Mario), a recurring enemy from the Super Mario series * Pokey (Gumby character), a character from the Gumby television series * Pokey the Penguin, a surrealistic online comic strip and its eponymous title character * Pokey, the nickname for \\"Clyde\\", the orange ghost, in the arcade game Pac-Man * Pokey Minch (Porky Minch), a character in the Super NES video game EarthBound (Mother 2), and the Pig King in Mother 3 * The Poky Little Puppy, a fictional character whose name is sometimes shortened to just Poky * Poky (Yoko Tsuno), a character in comic album series Yoko Tsuno * Poky (device), a casino gambling machine ==PeopleNickname=== * Pokey Allen (born 1943-1996), football player and head coach * Pokey Chatman (born 1969), Women's National Basketball Association general manager and head coach * Pokey LaFarge (born 1983), American musician and songwriter * Pokey Reddick (born 1964), retired National Hockey League goaltender * Pokey Reese (born 1973), former Major League Baseball player * Lillian Watson (born 1950), American former world record holder ===Surname=== * Diana Pokie, politician in Suriname * Gregory Pokie (born 1987), footballer in Suriname - see Suriname national football team ==Slang== * Pokey, a slang expression for prison * Pokies, Australian slang for slot machines ==Other uses== * POKEY, a digital I/O chip in the Atari 8-bit family of computers and many arcade games * Any of several species of Poecilotheria, a genus of spiders * \\"Pokey Award\\" by the Straphangers Campaign for the slowest bus route, by vehicle average miles per hour, in New York City. * Poky, a reference distribution of the Yocto Project Category:Lists of people by nickname ","title":"Pokey"},{"id":"515728","text":"The Fryingpan River is a tributary of the Roaring Fork River, approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey.

Fungi can cause serious damage in agriculture, resulting in critical losses of yield, quality, and profit. Fungicides are used both in agriculture and to fight fungal infections in animals. Chemicals used to control oomycetes, which are not fungi, are also referred to as fungicides, as oomycetes use the same mechanisms as fungi to infect plants.Latijnhouwers M, de Wit PJ, Govers F. Oomycetes and fungi: similar weaponry to attack plants. Trends in Microbiology Volume 11 462-469 Fungicides can either be contact, translaminar or systemic. Contact fungicides are not taken up into the plant tissue and protect only the plant where the spray is deposited. Translaminar fungicides redistribute the fungicide from the upper, sprayed leaf surface to the lower, unsprayed surface. Systemic fungicides are taken up and redistributed through the xylem vessels. Few fungicides move to all parts of a plant. Some are locally systemic, and some move upwardly. Most fungicides that can be bought retail are sold in a liquid form. A very common active ingredient is sulfur,C.Michael Hogan. 2011. Sulfur. Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC present at 0.08% in weaker concentrates, and as high as 0.5% for more potent fungicides. Fungicides in powdered form are usually around 90% sulfur and are very toxic. Other active ingredients in fungicides include neem oil, rosemary oil, jojoba oil, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and the beneficial fungus Ulocladium oudemansii. Fungicide residues have been found on food for human consumption, mostly from post-harvest treatments.Pesticide Chemistry and Bioscience edited by G.T Brooks and T.R Roberts. 1999. Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Some fungicides are dangerous to human health, such as vinclozolin, which has now been removed from use.Hrelia et al. 1996 - The genetic and non-genetic toxicity of the fungicide Vinclozolin. Mutagenesis Volume 11 445-453 Ziram is also a fungicide that is toxic to humans with long-term exposure, and fatal if ingested.National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem Compound Database; CID=8722, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/8722(accessed Jan. 13, 2019) A number of fungicides are also used in human health care. == Natural fungicides == Plants and other organisms have chemical defenses that give them an advantage against microorganisms such as fungi. Some of these compounds can be used as fungicides: *α-Cadinol (present in essential oils of different plants) *Citronella oil *Gmelinol (isolated from Gmelina arborea) *Hinokitiol (isolated from Cupressaceae trees) *Jojoba oil *Mesquitol (isolated from Prosopis trees) *Milk *Nimbin (isolated from neem) *Oregano oil *Rosemary oil *Tea tree oil Whole live or dead organisms that are efficient at killing or inhibiting fungi can sometimes be used as fungicides: *Bacillus subtilis *Ulocladium oudemansii *Kelp (powdered dried kelp is fed to cattle to help prevent fungal infection) * Ampelomyces quisqualis == Resistance == Pathogens respond to the use of fungicides by evolving resistance. In the field several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. The evolution of fungicide resistance can be gradual or sudden. In qualitative or discrete resistance, a mutation (normally to a single gene) produces a race of a fungus with a high degree of resistance. Such resistant varieties also tend to show stability, persisting after the fungicide has been removed from the market. For example, sugar beet leaf blotch remains resistant to azoles years after they were no longer used for control of the disease. This is because such mutations have a high selection pressure when the fungicide is used, but there is low selection pressure to remove them in the absence of the fungicide. In instances where resistance occurs more gradually, a shift in sensitivity in the pathogen to the fungicide can be seen. Such resistance is polygenic – an accumulation of many mutations in different genes, each having a small additive effect. This type of resistance is known as quantitative or continuous resistance. In this kind of resistance, the pathogen population will revert to a sensitive state if the fungicide is no longer applied. Little is known about how variations in fungicide treatment affect the selection pressure to evolve resistance to that fungicide. Evidence shows that the doses that provide the most control of the disease also provide the largest selection pressure to acquire resistance, and that lower doses decrease the selection pressure.Metcalfe, R.J. et al. (2000) The effect of dose and mobility on the strength of selection for DMI (sterol demethylation inhibitors) fungicide resistance in inoculated field experiments. Plant Pathology 49: 546–557 In some cases when a pathogen evolves resistance to one fungicide, it automatically obtains resistance to others – a phenomenon known as cross resistance. These additional fungicides are normally of the same chemical family or have the same mode of action, or can be detoxified by the same mechanism. Sometimes negative cross resistance occurs, where resistance to one chemical class of fungicides leads to an increase in sensitivity to a different chemical class of fungicides. This has been seen with carbendazim and diethofencarb. There are also recorded incidences of the evolution of multiple drug resistance by pathogens – resistance to two chemically different fungicides by separate mutation events. For example, Botrytis cinerea is resistant to both azoles and dicarboximide fungicides. There are several routes by which pathogens can evolve fungicide resistance. The most common mechanism appears to be alteration of the target site, in particular as a defence against single site of action fungicides. For example, Black Sigatoka, an economically important pathogen of banana, is resistant to the QoI fungicides, due to a single nucleotide change resulting in the replacement of one amino acid (glycine) by another (alanine) in the target protein of the QoI fungicides, cytochrome b.Sierotzki, Helge (2000) Mode of resistance to respiration inhibitors at the cytochrome bc1 enzyme complex of Mycosphaerella fijiensis field isolates Pest Management Science 56:833–841 It is presumed that this disrupts the binding of the fungicide to the protein, rendering the fungicide ineffective. Upregulation of target genes can also render the fungicide ineffective. This is seen in DMI-resistant strains of Venturia inaequalis.Schnabel, G., and Jones, A. L. 2001. The 14a-demethylase (CYP51A1) gene is overexpressed in V. inaequalis strains resistant to myclobutanil. Phytopathology 91:102–110. Resistance to fungicides can also be developed by efficient efflux of the fungicide out of the cell. Septoria tritici has developed multiple drug resistance using this mechanism. The pathogen had five ABC-type transporters with overlapping substrate specificities that together work to pump toxic chemicals out of the cell.Zwiers, L. H. et al. (2003) ABC transporters of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola function as protectants against biotic and xenobiotic toxic compounds. Molecular Genetics and Genomics 269:499–507 In addition to the mechanisms outlined above, fungi may also develop metabolic pathways that circumvent the target protein, or acquire enzymes that enable metabolism of the fungicide to a harmless substance. ===Fungicide resistance management=== The fungicide resistance action committee (FRAC) has several recommended practices to try to avoid the development of fungicide resistance, especially in at-risk fungicides including Strobilurins such as azoxystrobin. FRAC assigns groups of fungicides into classes where cross-resistance is likely, usually because the active ingredients share a common mode of action. Products should not always be used in isolation, but rather as mixture, or alternate sprays, with another fungicide with a different mechanism of action. The likelihood of the pathogen's developing resistance is greatly decreased by the fact that any resistant isolates to one fungicide will be killed by the other; in other words, two mutations would be required rather than just one. The effectiveness of this technique can be demonstrated by Metalaxyl, a phenylamide fungicide. When used as the sole product in Ireland to control potato blight (Phytophthora infestans), resistance developed within one growing season. However, in countries like the UK where it was marketed only as a mixture, resistance problems developed more slowly. Fungicides should be applied only when absolutely necessary, especially if they are in an at-risk group. Lowering the amount of fungicide in the environment lowers the selection pressure for resistance to develop. Manufacturers’ doses should always be followed. These doses are normally designed to give the right balance between controlling the disease and limiting the risk of resistance development. Higher doses increase the selection pressure for single-site mutations that confer resistance, as all strains but those that carry the mutation will be eliminated, and thus the resistant strain will propagate. Lower doses greatly increase the risk of polygenic resistance, as strains that are slightly less sensitive to the fungicide may survive. It is better to use an integrative pest management approach to disease control rather than relying on fungicides alone. This involves the use of resistant varieties and hygienic practices, such as the removal of potato discard piles and stubble on which the pathogen can overwinter, greatly reducing the titre of the pathogen and thus the risk of fungicide resistance development. == See also == *Antifungal drug *Index of pesticide articles *List of fungicides *PHI-base (Pathogen-Host-Interaction database) *Phytopathology *Plant disease forecasting ==References== ==External links== *Fungicide Resistance Action Committee *Fungicide Resistance Action Group, United Kingdom *General Pesticide Information - National Pesticide Information Center, Oregon State University, United States Category:Mycology Category:Biocides ","title":"Fungicide"},{"id":"515766","text":"Laura Pausini (; born 16 May 1974) is an Italian singer-songwriter, record producer and television personality. As a child, she was encouraged by her father to join him during his performances in local piano bars. After competing in local singing contests, Pausini signed her first recording contract. She rose to fame in 1993, winning the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with her debut single \\"La solitudine\\", which became an Italian standard and an international hit, topping the charts in Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Her self titled debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide. Its follow-up, Laura, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide. During the same year, she released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, composed of ten adapted songs originally included in her previous works. The album was certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain, making her the first non-Spanish artist to sell more than one million copies in Spain. As of 2017, Pausini has released twelve studio albums, two international greatest hits albums and two compilation albums for the Hispanic and Anglophone market only, respectively. She mostly performs in Italian and Spanish, but she has also recorded songs in English, French, Portuguese and more recently, Catalan. Her sole English-language album of original songs, From the Inside, was released in 2002, but failed to satisfy commercial expectations both in North America and in the rest of the world. In 2006, her record Io canto was the best-selling album of the year in Italy. In 2004, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales \\"an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English–language market\\". FIMI certified Pausini's sales of more than 70 million records with a FIMI Icon Award. Pausini appeared as a coach on both the Mexican and Spanish versions of international reality television singing competition franchise The Voice, was a judge on the first and second series of La banda, and is likewise a judge on the Spanish version of international franchise The X Factor. In 2016, she also debuted as a variety show presenter, hosting the television show Laura & Paola, with actress Paola Cortellesi. Throughout her career, she has won numerous music awards in Italy and internationally. She has earned the first and third place at the Sanremo Music Festival, two \\"Lunezia Awards\\", ten Wind Music Awards, four awards at the Festivalbar, seven Telegatti, and an MTV Italian Music Award. Internationally, she has won four awards at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival, three Lo Nuestro Awards, four Latin Grammy Awards, a Billboard Latin Music Award, and six World Music Awards. In 2006, she also became the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award, receiving the accolade for Best Latin Pop Album for the record Escucha. She has been honoured as a Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and as a World Ambassador of Emilia Romagna. ==BiographyChildhood and early beginnings=== The elder of two daughters, Laura Pausini was born in Faenza, in the Province of Ravenna, Italy, to Fabrizio Pausini and Gianna Ballardini. She grew up in Solarolo, a small comune in the same region.[A] Her father is a former pianist who also played as a sessionman for ABBA's Frida Lyngstad and entered a band whose members later founded the Italian pop group Pooh. After becoming a piano bar artist, he encouraged Pausini to start performing as a singer. Her first live performance was on 16 May 1985, when she sang together with her father in a restaurant in Bologna. Since then, her father started giving her singing lessons and she continued to perform alongside him in local piano bars. In the meanwhile, she also started singing in a church choir. In 1987 she recorded her first demo album, produced by her father and released to promote her live shows. Titled I sogni di Laura, it consisted of eight covers and five new songs. In 1991 she participated in the Castrocaro Music Festival singing Liza Minnelli's \\"New York, New York\\", but she failed to reach the final stage of the competition. During the same year, she took part in another singing competition, Sanremo Famosi, which should have served as a selection for the newcomers' of the following Sanremo Music Festival. Despite being declared joint winner with another contestant, Pausini was not allowed to compete in the Sanremo Music Festival 1992. ===1993: Career breakthrough=== Thanks to her performances in local singing competitions, Pausini was noticed by Italian producer and songwriter Angelo Valsiglio, who introduced her to manager Marco Marati. Valsiglio suggested to her \\"La solitudine\\", a song he wrote with Pietro Cremonesi and Federico Cavalli. Pausini's rendition convinced Valsiglio and Marati, who wanted Pausini to audition for some major labels. During one of the auditions, she met Fabrizio Giannini of Warner Music Italy's Compagnia Generale del Disco. After impressing him with a performance of an unreleased Mia Martini song, Pausini obtained her first recording contract, becoming one of the first artists discovered by Giannini, who later launched the careers of several Italian acts, including Irene Grandi. Pausini rose to fame in 1993, after winning the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival, annually held at the Teatro Ariston in Sanremo, Italy \\"La solitudine\\" was selected as one of the entries in the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival. Pausini performed it for the first time on 23 February 1993, during the first semifinal of the contest. After being admitted to the final, held on 27 February 1993, she won the competition, receiving 7,464 votes from the juries and beating Gerardina Trovato with \\"Ma non ho più la mia città\\", who took second place with 7,209 votes. The song also became a commercial success in Italy, peaking at number one on the Italian Musica e dischi singles chart in March 1993 and maintaining the top spot for three consecutive weeks, and it is still one of Pausini's best-known hits. Following the success obtained with her debut single, Pausini started working on her first professional album, Laura Pausini. The album was recorded while Pausini was still a high school student at the \\"Gaetano Ballardini\\" Institute of Ceramics in Faenza, Italy, where she got her diploma a few months after the release of her debut studio set. Released by CGD Records in May 1993, it reached the sixth position on the Italian Musica e dischi albums chart, selling 400,000 copies in Italy. The album was also promoted through an Italian outdoor tour during the summer of 1993. In September 1993, Pausini received a Telegatto for Revelation of the Year. In late 1993, the album was released in the rest of Europe, peaking at number three on the Dutch Albums Chart and reaching the top spot in Belgium. It also achieved commercial success in South America, being certified gold in Brazil and Argentina. Worldwide sales of Pausini's debut studio album exceed two million units. Moreover, \\"La solitudine\\" became a radio hit in Belgium and the Netherlands, it peaked at number five on the French Singles Chart and it reached the top spot of the Dutch Top 40 and of the Flemish Ultratop 50. The album also spawned the singles \\"Non c'è\\" and \\"Perché non torna più\\". ===1994–1995: Spanish-language debut and international success=== In February 1994, Pausini participated for the second time in the Sanremo Music Festival, competing in the \\"Big Artists\\" section with her entry \\"Strani amori\\". The song ranked third in the competition, behind Aleandro Baldi's \\"Passerà\\" and Giorgio Faletti's \\"Signor tenente\\", and became a hit in Italy, in the Netherlands and in Flanders. The single launched Pausini's second studio album, Laura, released in February 1994. According to CGD Records, the album sold 150,000 copies in Italy in its first week, with initial shipments of 200,000 units. It also peaked at number one on the Dutch Albums Chart and entered the charts in Belgium and Switzerland, selling three million copies worldwide and achieving gold and platinum status in Brazil and Argentina, respectively. Other singles from the album were \\"Gente\\", \\"Lui non sta con te\\" and \\"Lettera\\". During the summer of 1994, Pausini took part in the Italian itinerant TV show Festivalbar, reaching the final stage of the music competition and receiving the Premio Europa for her international success. In 1994 she was also awarded with her second Telegatto, receiving the prize for Best Female Artist. In the meanwhile, she started an Italian tour to promote her album. During the same year, Pausini released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, a compilation of ten adapted versions of hits from her previous albums, issued by Dro Records. The record became the best-selling album of 1994 in Spain, where it was later certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain for sales exceeding one million units. Pausini was the first non-Spanish artist to achieve this result. Following the commercial success obtained in the country, the Spanish Institute of Italian Culture awarded her a \\"Globo de Platino\\" for contributing in the spread of Italian culture in Spain. The album was successful in Latin America too, being certified platinum by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers, the Asociación Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas and the Chilean division of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Moreover, the first four singles from the album, \\"La soledad\\", \\"Se fue\\", \\"Amores extraños\\" and \\"Gente\\", entered the top 30 on the Hot Latin Songs chart compiled by Billboard. Thanks to these results, Billboard ranked Pausini the second female revelation of 1994, after Mariah Carey. In 1995 Pausini also received the World Music Award for Best Selling Italian Recording Artist and the Lo Nuestro Award for Best New Artist of the Year. Pausini's first record for the British market was a self-titled compilation album released in 1995, including nine Italian-language hits and an English-language version of her first single, \\"La solitudine (Loneliness)\\", whose lyrics were adapted by Tim Rice. \\"La solitudine (Loneliness)\\" was initially set to be released as a single in the United Kingdom on 19 June 1995, but it was postponed and released in September of the same year. Both the album and the single obtained a very poor commercial reception, failing to enter the charts in the United Kingdom. === 1996–1997: Le cose che vivi and World Wide Tour 1997 === Following the success obtained by Pausini's debut Spanish album, her third studio set was released on 12 September 1996 both in Italian and Spanish, under the titles Le cose che vivi and Las cosas que vives, respectively. Starting from that moment, Pausini has recorded most of her songs both in her native language and in Spanish, in a practice that, according to Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier, has \\"come to define her career and compound her success\\". A special edition of the album was also released in Brazil, featuring three additional bonus tracks in Portuguese. The album was preceded by the single \\"Incancellabile\\", released to Italian radio stations on 26 August 1996 and titled \\"Inolvidable\\" in its version for the Hispanic market. Other singles from the album include the title-track \\"Le cose che vivi\\", whose Spanish- language version topped the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart, \\"Ascolta il tuo cuore\\", \\"Seamisai\\" and \\"Dos enamorados\\", which was not released in its Italian-language version. The album sold 3,500,000 copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, for European sales exceeding 1,000,000 units. At the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards for Latin Music, Pausini was nominated for Pop Female Singer and Video of the Year for the Spanish-language version of \\"Le cose che vivi\\". In December 1996, Pausini was among the artists singing for Pope John Paul II during the Natale in Vaticano concert, a Christmas show held at the Paul VI Audience Hall. During the event, she performed a cover of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" and the song \\"Il mondo che vorrei\\". In February 1997 she was also invited as a guest to the Viña del Mar International Song Festival in Chile. On 1 March 1997, she launched from Geneva the World Wide Tour in support of the album, giving concerts in Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, France, as well as in the United States, Canada and many American countries, including Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Mexico. It was Pausini's first international tour, during which she gave concerts in indoor arenas for the first time. In August of the same year, during the last night of the Festivalbar, she received the International Award for the success she achieved abroad. ===1998–1999: La mia risposta / Mi respuesta and second World Tour=== In 1998, Pausini released her fourth studio album, La mia risposta, together with its Spanish-language counterpart, Mi respuesta. The album, which included a song penned by Phil Collins, was dubbed by Italian music critics as a mature work, with influences from soul music, but, despite reaching the top spot of the Italian Albums Chart, it was a moderate commercial success, selling two million copies worldwide. The lead single from the album, \\"Un'emergenza d'amore\\", was released in September 1998, and was followed by \\"In assenza di te\\" and \\"La mia risposta\\", the latter being performed during the Festivalbar in 1999. To promote the album, Pausini began in early 1999 the La Mia Risposta World Tour '99, during which she performed in theatres throughout Europe. On 1 June 1999, she was one of the artists performing along with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in Modena during his annual \\"Pavarotti and Friends\\" concert. Pavarotti and Pausini duetted in the Italian version of the aria \\"Dein ist mein ganzes Herz\\", titled \\"Tu che m'hai preso il cuor\\", from Franz Lehár's operetta Das Land des Lächelns. The live performance was later included in the album Pavarotti & Friends for the Children of Guatemala and Kosovo. In 1999 she also contributed the Richard Marx composition \\"One More Time\\" to the Message in a Bottle soundtrack. The track was produced by David Foster who was featured on piano. ===2000–2001: Tra te e il mare / Entre tú y mil mares and greatest hits album=== In 2000, she recorded the song \\"The Extra Mile\\" for the soundtrack of the movie Pokémon 2000: The Power of One. The song was included in the album Tra te e il mare, released on 11 September 2000 and preceded by the homonymous single, written by Italian pop singer Biagio Antonacci. Other singles from the album include \\"Il mio sbaglio più grande\\", which was a top 20 hit in Italy, and \\"Volevo dirti che ti amo\\", whose Spanish-language version \\"Quiero decirte que te amo\\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. The album also features the songs \\"Viaggio con te\\", which was composed by her father and which was awarded in 2001 with an Italian Lunezia Award for Best Songwriter of the Year, and \\"Per vivere\\", written from the point of view of a homeless child Pausini met in Rio de Janeiro and dedicated to two Brazilian children sponsored by her. Tra te e il mare received a nomination for Album of the Year at the Premio Italiano della Musica, while Pausini was nominated for Best Female Artist during the same award ceremony, as well as in the first edition of the Italian Music Awards, held in February 2001. A Spanish-language version of the album, titled Entre tú y mil mares, was released shortly before the Italian-language edition, on 11 September 2000. At the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards, the record received two nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Album and Best Engineered Album, while Pausini and Alfredo Cerruti were in the shortlist for Producer of the Year. Pausini's first international greatest hits album was released in 2001, both in an Italian-language version and in a Spanish-language edition, titled The Best of Laura Pausini: E ritorno da te and Lo mejor de Laura Pausini: Volveré junto a ti, respectively. The first single, \\"E ritorno da te\\"—\\"Volveré junto a ti\\" in Spanish—was accompanied by a music video shot by Italian film director Gabriele Muccino. The album also includes the single \\"Una storia che vale\\" and features guest appearances by Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil in \\"Seamisai\\" and by Italian singer Nek, who plays bass in \\"Non c'è\\". Supported by the 2001/2002 World Tour, which started in Miami on 19 October 2001, the greatest hits became one of Pausini's biggest commercial successes, selling 700,000 copies in Italy and 800,000 copies in France. During the concert she gave in Milan on 2 December 2001 as part of the tour, Pausini also recorded her first live video album, titled Live 2001-2002 World Tour and released on 30 November 2002. ===2002–2003: From the Inside, the English-language debut=== In 2001, Pausini started working with producers such as Patrick Leonard and John Shanks on her first English-language album, From the Inside. Released in Canada, Mexico and the United States by Atlantic Records on 5 November 2002, the album did not get the expected success, selling 50,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen-Soundscan. The album singles \\"Surrender\\" and \\"If That's Love\\" reached the top spot on the Hot Dance Club Songs Chart, but Pausini, disappointed at her English-language debut being ignored in the U.S. outside the club scene, abandoned the promotion for From the Inside due to her label promoting it as a dance album instead of a pop album as she requested. The album was later released in Europe too, selling 800,000 copies worldwide. In 2003 Luciano Pavarotti invited her for the second time to the \\"Pavarotti and Friends\\" concert, where they duetted again in \\"Tu che m'hai preso il cuor\\". ===2004–2005: Resta in ascolto / Escucha and the Grammy=== Resta in ascolto / Escucha in 2004. In October 2004 Pausini released her eight studio album, Resta in ascolto, and its Spanish-language counterpart, Escucha. Influenced by international artists including Phil Collins and Celine Dion, the recording is on the subject of a break-up and was written in 2002, during her separation from her ex-boyfriend and producer Alfredo Cerruti. The album features the song \\"Mi abbandono a te\\", co-written by Pausini, Rick Nowels and Madonna. It also includes the Biagio Antonacci-written ballad \\"Vivimi\\", whose Spanish- language version, \\"Viveme\\", won a Billboard Latin Music Award in 2006 for Female Latin Pop Airplay Song of the Year, and the single \\"Benedetta passione\\", penned by Italian rock-star Vasco Rossi. Well received by music critics, the album is mainly focused on themes of anger, bitterness, desire for independence and interior peace, but also features a song about the Iraq War, in which Pausini sings about Ali Ismail Abbas, a boy who was severely injured in a nighttime rocket attack near Baghdad in 2003. The album debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and sold 350,000 copies in Italy. Its Spanish version later won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2005 and Best Latin Pop Album at the 48th Grammy Awards, making Pausini the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award. In January 2005, Pausini started a new tour to promote the album. The concerts she gave at the Zénith de Paris on 22 and 23 March 2005 were filmed and released as a live album in November 2005, titled Live in Paris 05. Pausini made a guest appearance on Michael Bublé's 2005 live album Caught in the Act, singing a duet with Bublé of Lou Rawls' hit \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\". The duet was placed on both the audio CD, and the full concert DVD that aired on PBS as an episode of Great Performances. At the 2006 Lo Nuestro Award, Pausini was nominated in the sections Album of the Year for Escucha, Song of the Year and Video of the Year for \\"Viveme\\" and won the award for Best Female Pop Artist. ===2006–2007: Io canto and the concert in San Siro=== Pausini performing during the Festival Teatro-Canzone, in memory of Italian singer Giorgio Gaber, on 21 July 2007. In November 2006, Pausini released the album Io canto / Yo canto, consisting of covers of Italian pop rock songs. On the album liner notes, Pausini wrote: \\"here is the music I listen to when I'm at my saddest, or when I feel a moment is special, the songs I used to sing as a young girl when I first started performing, and above all those which taught me to love music, and how music can move you so deeply, regardless of its genre or style\\". The album also features duets with Tiziano Ferro, Juanes and Johnny Hallyday. It debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and held the top spot for 8 non-consecutive weeks. It also became the best-selling album of 2006 in Italy, selling 500,000 copies in less than two months. On 8 November 2007, the album won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. Laura dedicated the award to the memory of Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Later on during the show she sang \\"Vivere (Dare to Live)\\" alongside Italian singer Andrea Bocelli. In Summer 2006, Pausini played a Juntos en concierto tour with Marc Anthony and Marco Antonio Solís, consisting of 20 concerts throughout the United States. On 2 June 2007, Laura Pausini was the first female artist to play at the San Siro Stadium in Milan, in front of a crowd of 70,000 spectators.

Pausini grew up listening to Aznavour's songs, and in a January 2009 interview on France 2's Vivement Dimanche hosted by Michel Drucker, Aznavour said of Pausini, seated by his side after a live duet performance of \\"Paris au mois d'août,\\" that \\"she knows the lyrics [to my songs] better than me.\\" In November 2009 Primavera in anticipo went on to win Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards.

In Autumn 2014, Pausini was one of the four coaches of the fourth season of the Mexican reality show and singing competition La Voz. Pausini also served as a coach for the third series of the Spanish version of the competition, La Voz, which debuted on Telecinco in January 2015. During the same year, she continued her tour, which reached Australia and Russia. ===2015–2016: Simili, TV shows and Laura Xmas=== Pausini during a show of the Latin American leg of the Simili World Tour, September 2016 At the 27th Lo Nuestro Awards, Pausini received a special award in recognition of her music career trajectory. After performing a medley of songs including the salsa version of \\"Se fué\\" with Marc Anthony, she stated that although she is Italian, \\"half of my heart beats Latino\\". In August 2015, Pausini co-wrote the song \\"Como yo sabría\\", with fellow Italian singer-songwriter Virginio Simonelli. The song was recorded by Maverick Lopes, a runner-up in the third season of La Voz Spain, mentored by Pausini herself during the competition. In September of the same year, Pausini, together with singers Alejandro Sanz and Ricky Martin, was a judge in the Univision talent show La banda, created by Simon Cowell. Pausini's eleventh studio album, Simili, was released on 6 November 2015. The first single from the album, \\"Lato destro del cuore\\"—\\"Lado derecho del corazón\\" in Spanish—was written by Biagio Antonacci. The album's title-track, after being released as its second single, was chosen as the opening song of the third season of Italian TV series Braccialetti rossi. The album also spawned the singles \\"En la puerta de al lado\\", \\"Innamorata\\" / \\"Enamorada\\", \\"Ho creduto a me\\" / \\"He creído en mi\\" and \\"200 note\\". The Spanish-language version of the album, Similares, received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album. In April 2016, Pausini hosted with Paola Cortellesi the variety show Laura e Paola, broadcast in Italy by Rai 1. The show included three episodes. Thanks to the show, Pausini received an award at the Premio TV 2016 as TV Personality Revelation of the Year. In June 2016, Pausini became the first Italian female artist to perform a tour in Italian stadiums. Her Pausini Stadi Tour 2016 included concerts at the San Siro Stadium in Milan, at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, and at the Stadio della Vittoria in Bari. The second and third legs of the tour consisted of shows in Latin America and Europe, respectively, and concluded in October 2016. In late 2016, Pausini was also confirmed as a judge on the second series of La banda. On 4 November 2016, Pausini released her first Christmas album, Laura Xmas, titled Laura Navidad in its Spanish version. The album, produced by Patrick Williams and recorded with his orchestra, was launched with a performance at Disneyland Paris. ===2017–2018: Fatti sentire and World Wide Tour=== In Autumn 2017, Pausini returned as a coach on the sixth series of La Voz... México. Her new studio album, Fatti sentire, will be released on 16 March 2018, both in its Italian-language version and in its Spanish-language counterpart, titled Hazte sentir. The lead single \\"Non è detto\\"—\\"Nadie ha dicho\\" in Spanish—was released on 16 January 2018. The single was performed during the final night of the 68th Sanremo Music Festival, where Pausini appeared as a special guest. \\"Nadie ha dicho\\" premiered in the United States with a performance during the Lo Nuestro Awards gala on 22 February 2018, which were co-hosted by Pausini herself. In Spring 2018, Laura Pausini also appeared as a judge on the third series of Spanish talent show Factor X, which was won by Pol Granch, one of the contestants she mentored as part of the Boys category. To promote Fatti sentire, she embarked on a worldwide tour, starting with two concerts at the Circus Maximus in Rome, which then passed throughout the United States and Latin America. In the fall, she returned to perform all throughout Italy in between September and October. The two concerts in Eboli, originally to be done in September, were rescheduled for November. She performed in Europe: Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. ===2019-2021: LB Stadi Tour, and Una. Nessuna. Centomila=== In the Summer of 2019, she performed 11 concerts along with Biagio Antonacci throughout Italy in the LB Stadi Tour. After performing in these concerts, she said that she would take two years without recording music, so she could listen to new melodies, to be with her daughter, and get some inspiration. In the first months of 2020, she began to participate in the Spanish edition of La Voz. Originally announced on 5 October 2019, she will perform a concert titled \\"Pausini BeMe\\" as part of the annual Fan Club (LPFC) party to be held on 5 September 2020 to celebrate the 25th years of the Fan Club inauguration. Since January 2020, she asks fans the songs they want to be performed in the setlist. On 19 May 2020, through her social networks, she announces that the Fan Club Party to be held on 5 September is cancelled, due to the Italian Government's decision to cancel all live concerts through October 2020 due to the ongoing pandemic state in Italy by the Coronavirus. In February, as a guest in the San Remo Festival, she announced that on 19 September 2020 she will perform a one-night only concert in the RCF Campovolo in Reggio Emilia, along with 6 other Italian female artists: Elisa, Fiorella Mannoia, Alessandra Amoroso, Emma, Gianna Nannini, and Giorgia. The concert will be held to help women suffering from domestic violence. On 21 May 2020, it is announced that the concert \\"Una. Nessuna. Centomila\\" will be postponed to 26 June 2021, because of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. ==Artistry== Laura Pausini is described as a mezzo-soprano with a classic and powerful voice. Due to her voice, Pausini has been compared by music critics to various female artists, including Milva, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand. At the beginning of her career, she was considered by music critics as a teen idol mainly singing about adolescent love affairs and problems. She was also strongly criticized for her songs, described as too melancholic and trivial. Starting from her 1998's La mia risposta / Mi respuesta, Italian music critics considered her as a more mature singer and later praised her simplicity and her voice, describing Pausini as an interpreter of her years. Although Pausini is mainly a melodic pop singer, her musical style evolved during her career, with influences from various genres, including Latin music, soul music and rock music. In 2001, David Cazares of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel described Pausini's music as \\"an assortment of glossy and sentimental pop ballads backed by light rock instrumentation and synthesized strings\\". In 2006, The Washington Post's Achy Obejas wrote that Pausini is distinguished from other Latin pop singer by her sophistication and her European sensibilities. According to Musica e dischi's Antonio Orlando, the key elements in Pausini's style are romanticism, optimism, melancholy and surrounding melodies. Starting from her 1996's album Le cose che vivi / Las cosas que vives, Pausini has also co-written most of her songs and starting from her 1998's La mia risposta / Mi respuesta she has been involved in the production of her albums. ==Personal life== Pausini left her hometown in 1995, when she moved to Milan with her partner, manager and producer Alfredo Cerruti Jr. Their relationship ended in 2002. Between 2002 and 2005 Pausini was romantically involved with her new manager, Gabriele Parisi. She is currently engaged with the Italian guitarist, composer, music producer and former singer Paolo Carta. On 15 September 2012, Pausini confirmed through her official Facebook page that she was expecting her first child with her partner Paolo Carta. Their daughter, Paola, was born on 8 February 2013. Pausini describes herself as a Roman Catholic woman, but expressed doubts about the Church's position on various themes, including contraception, abortion, premarital sex and gay rights. In September 2000 she explained her position during an interview to the Italian newspaper la Repubblica: ==Honours== 100px – Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic: Awarded the third highest civil honour in Italy, by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on 6 February 2006. ==Discography== Laura Pausini ===Studio albums=== *Laura Pausini (1993) *Laura (1994) *Laura Pausini (1994) *Le cose che vivi / Las cosas que vives (1996) *La mia risposta / Mi respuesta (1998) *Tra te e il mare / Entre tú y mil mares (2000) *From the Inside (2002) *Resta in ascolto / Escucha (2004) *Io canto / Yo canto (2006) *Primavera in anticipo / Primavera anticipada (2008) *Inedito / Inédito (2011) *Simili / Similares (2015) *Laura Xmas / Laura Navidad (2016) *Fatti sentire / Hazte sentir (2018) ===Compilations, duets and live albums=== *Laura Pausini (1995) *The Best of Laura Pausini: E ritorno da te (2001) *Live in Paris 05 (2005) *San Siro 2007 (2007) *Laura Live World Tour 09 (2009) *20 – The Greatest Hits (2013) ==Tours== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !Tour !Year(s) !Releases !Format(s) - !scope=\\"row\\"Laura Pausini on Tour style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1993–94   - !scope=\\"row\\"World Wide Tour 1997 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1997   - !scope=\\"row\\"La Mia Risposta World Tour style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1999   - !scope=\\"row\\"E ritorno da te World Tour style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2001–02 Live 2001-2002 World Tour DVD - !scope=\\"row\\"Laura Pausini Live style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2005 Live in Paris 05 CD+DVD, 2× DVD, CD - !scope=\\"row\\"Juntos en concierto 2006 (with Marc Anthony and Marco Antonio Solís) style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2006   - !scope=\\"row\\"Io canto–Yo canto style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2007 San Siro 2007 CD+DVD, CD, DVD - !scope=\\"row\\"LP World Tour style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2009 Laura Live World Tour 09 CD+DVD - !scope=\\"row\\"Inedito World Tour style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2011–12 Inedito (Special Edition) (includes a live bonus track and a live DVD) CD+DVD - !scope=\\"row\\"The Greatest Hits World Tour style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2013–15   - !scope=\\"row\\"Simili Tour style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2016   - !scope=\\"row\\"Fatti Sentire World Tour style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2018 Fatti Sentire Ancora CD+DVD } ==Filmography== ;Television {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !Year !Series !Role !Network !Notes - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2009 !scope=\\"row\\"Due Herself Rai Due Music TV show – 1 episode as main performer and presenter, shared with Tiziano Ferro - rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2014 !scope=\\"row\\"Laura Pausini 20 – My Story Herself Sky Italia Autobiographical documentary – 1 episode - !scope=\\"row\\"Stasera Laura: ho creduto in un sogno Herself Rai Uno Music TV show & concert – 1 episode, main performer and presenter - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2014, 2017 !scope=\\"row\\"La Voz...

He was educated at Batley Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained First Class Honours in Natural Sciences. He then got a DSc from University of London in 1904. Owen Willans Richardson (1928) After graduating in 1900, he began researching the emission of electricity from hot bodies at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, and in October 1902 he was made a fellow at Trinity. In 1901, he demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the Arrhenius equation. This became known as Richardson's law: \\"If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current s should obey the law s = A\\\\,T^{1/2}\\\\,e^{-b/T}.\\"O. W. Richardson (1901) \\"On the negative radiation from hot platinum,\\" Philosophical of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 11 : 286–295; see especially p. 287. Richardson was professor at Princeton University from 1906 to 1913, and returned to the UK in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at King's College London, where he was later made director of research. He retired in 1944, and died in 1959. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery. He also researched the photoelectric effect, the gyromagnetic effect, the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft X-rays, and the spectrum of hydrogen. Richardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague Harold Wilson, in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter. Richardson's own sister married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) Clinton Davisson, who was Richardson's PhD student at Princeton. After Lilian's death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist. Owen Willans Richardson had a son Harold Owen Richardson who specialised in Nuclear Physics and was also the chairman, Physics Department, Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus professor at London University. ==Honours== Richardson's grave in Brookwood Cemetery Richardson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1913, and was awarded its Hughes Medal in 1920. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928, \\"for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him\\".Nobel prize citation, Nobel foundation website He was knighted in 1939. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1879 births Category:1959 deaths Category:20th-century physicists Category:Academics of King's College London Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:British Nobel laureates Category:Burials at Brookwood Cemetery Category:English Nobel laureates Category:English physicists Category:Fellows of King's College London Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:People educated at Batley Grammar School Category:People from Dewsbury Category:Princeton University faculty Category:Royal Medal winners Category:Presidents of the Physical Society Category:Theoretical physicists ","title":"Owen Willans Richardson"},{"id":"515770","text":"The refresh rate (or \\"vertical refresh rate\\", \\"vertical scan rate\\", terminology originating with the cathode ray tubes) is the number of times per second that a raster-based display device displays a new image. This is independent from frame rate, which describes how many images are stored or generated every second by the device driving the display. On cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, higher refresh rates produce less flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. In other technologies such as liquid-crystal displays, the refresh rate affects only how often the image can potentially be updated.How To Change the Screen Refresh Rate of Your Monitor in Windows XP Non-raster displays may not have a characteristic refresh rate. Vector displays, for instance, do not trace the entire screen, only the actual lines comprising the displayed image, so refresh speed may differ by the size and complexity of the image data. For computer programs or telemetry, the term is sometimes applied to how frequently a datum is updated with a new external value from another source (for example; a shared public spreadsheet or hardware feed). == Physical factors == While all raster display devices have a characteristic refresh rate, the physical implementation differs between technologies. ===Cathode ray tubes=== Electron beam in the process of scanning an image Raster-scan CRTs by their nature must refresh the screen, since their phosphors will fade and the image will disappear quickly unless refreshed regularly. In a CRT, the vertical scan rate is the number of times per second that the electron beam returns to the upper left corner of the screen to begin drawing a new frame. It is controlled by the vertical blanking signal generated by the video controller, and is partially limited by the monitor's maximum horizontal scan rate. The refresh rate can be calculated from the horizontal scan rate by dividing the scanning frequency by the number of horizontal lines, plus some amount of time to allow for the beam to return to the top. By convention, this is a 1.05x multiplier. For instance, a monitor with a horizontal scanning frequency of 96 kHz at a resolution of results in a refresh rate of 89 Hz (rounded down). CRT refresh rates have historically been an important factor in videogame programming. In early videogame systems, the only time available for computation was during the vertical blanking interval, during which the beam is returning to the top corner of the screen and no image is being drawn. Even in modern games, however, it is important to avoid altering the computer's video buffer except during the vertical retrace, to prevent flickering graphics or screen tearing. ===Liquid-crystal displays=== Unlike CRTs, where the image will fade unless refreshed, the pixels of liquid-crystal displays retain their state for as long power is provided, and consequently there is no intrinsic flicker regardless of refresh rate. However, refresh rate still determines the highest frame rate that can be displayed, and despite there being no actual blanking of the screen, the vertical blanking interval is still a period in each refresh cycle when the screen is not being updated, during which the image data in the host system's frame buffer can be updated. ==Computer displays== CPU fan rotating at 0 revolution per minute, 300 and 1300, recorded at 60 frames per second. On smaller CRT monitors (up to about ), few people notice any discomfort between 60-72 Hz. On larger CRT monitors ( or larger), most people experience mild discomfort unless the refresh is set to 72 Hz or higher. A rate of 100 Hz is comfortable at almost any size. However, this does not apply to LCD monitors. The closest equivalent to a refresh rate on an LCD monitor is its frame rate, which is often locked at 60 fps. But this is rarely a problem, because the only part of an LCD monitor that could produce CRT-like flicker—its backlight—typically operates at around a minimum of 200 Hz. Different operating systems set the default refresh rate differently. Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows 98 (First and Second Editions) set the refresh rate to the highest rate that they believe the display supports. Windows NT-based operating systems, such as Windows 2000 and its descendants Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, set the default refresh rate to a conservative rate, usually 60 Hz. Some fullscreen applications, including many games, now allow the user to reconfigure the refresh rate before entering fullscreen mode, but most default to a conservative resolution and refresh rate and let you increase the settings in the options. Old monitors could be damaged if a user set the video card to a refresh rate higher than the highest rate supported by the monitor. Some models of monitors display a notice that the video signal uses an unsupported refresh rate. == Dynamic refresh rate == Some LCDs support adapting their refresh rate to the current frame rate delivered by the graphics card. Two technologies that allow this are FreeSync and G-Sync. ==Stereo displays== When LCD shutter glasses are used for stereo 3D displays, the effective refresh rate is halved, because each eye needs a separate picture. For this reason, it is usually recommended to use a display capable of at least 120 Hz, because divided in half this rate is again 60 Hz. Higher refresh rates result in greater image stability, for example 72 Hz non-stereo is 144 Hz stereo, and 90 Hz non-stereo is 180 Hz stereo. Most low-end computer graphics cards and monitors cannot handle these high refresh rates, especially at higher resolutions. For LCD monitors the pixel brightness changes are much slower than CRT or plasma phosphors. Typically LCD pixel brightness changes are faster when voltage is applied than when voltage is removed, resulting in an asymmetric pixel response time. With 3D shutter glasses this can result in a blurry smearing of the display and poor depth perception, due to the previous image frame not fading to black fast enough as the next frame is drawn. ==Televisions== This gif animation shows a rudimentary comparison of how motion varies with 4Hz, 12Hz, and 24Hz refresh rates. Entire sequence has a frame rate of 24Hz. The development of televisions in the 1930s was determined by a number of technical limitations. The AC power line frequency was used for the vertical refresh rate for two reasons. The first reason was that the television's vacuum tube was susceptible to interference from the unit's power supply, including residual ripple. This could cause drifting horizontal bars (hum bars). Using the same frequency reduced this, and made interference static on the screen and therefore less obtrusive. The second reason was that television studios would use AC lamps, filming at a different frequency would cause strobing. Thus producers had little choice but to run sets at 60 Hz in America, and 50 Hz in Europe. These rates formed the basis for the sets used today: 60 Hz System M (almost always used with NTSC color coding) and 50 Hz System B/G (almost always used with PAL or SECAM color coding). This accident of chance gave European sets higher resolution, in exchange for lower frame- rates. Compare System M (704 × 480 at 30i) and System B/G (704 × 576 at 25i). However, the lower refresh rate of 50 Hz introduces more flicker, so sets that use digital technology to double the refresh rate to 100 Hz are now very popular. (see Broadcast television systems) Another difference between 50 Hz and 60 Hz standards is the way motion pictures (film sources as opposed to video camera sources) are transferred or presented. 35 mm film is typically shot at 24 frames per second (fps). For PAL 50 Hz this allows film sources to be easily transferred by accelerating the film by 4%. The resulting picture is therefore smooth, however, there is a small shift in the pitch of the audio. NTSC sets display both 24 fps and 25 fps material without any speed shifting by using a technique called 3:2 pulldown, but at the expense of introducing unsmooth playback in the form of telecine judder. Similar to some computer monitors and some DVDs, analog television systems use interlace, which decreases the apparent flicker by painting first the odd lines and then the even lines (these are known as fields). This doubles the refresh rate, compared to a progressive scan image at the same frame rate. This works perfectly for video cameras, where each field results from a separate exposure the effective frame rate doubles, there are now 50 rather than 25 exposures per second. The dynamics of a CRT are ideally suited to this approach, fast scenes will benefit from the 50 Hz refresh, the earlier field will have largely decayed away when the new field is written, and static images will benefit from improved resolution as both fields will be integrated by the eye. Modern CRT-based televisions may be made flicker-free in the form of 100 Hz technology. Many high-end LCD televisions now have a 120 or 240 Hz (current and former NTSC countries) or 100 or 200 Hz (PAL/SECAM countries) refresh rate. The rate of 120 was chosen as the least common multiple of 24 fps (cinema) and 30 fps (NTSC TV), and allows for less distortion when movies are viewed due to the elimination of telecine (3:2 pulldown). For PAL at 25 fps, 100 or 200 Hz is used as a fractional compromise of the least common multiple of 600 (24 × 25). These higher refresh rates are most effective from a 24p-source video output (e.g. Blu-ray Disc), and/or scenes of fast motion.What is refresh rate? ==Displaying movie content on a TV== As movies are usually filmed at a rate of 24 frames per second, while television sets operate at different rates, some conversion is necessary. Different techniques exist to give the viewer an optimal experience. The combination of content production, playback device, and display device processing may also give artifacts that are unnecessary. A display device producing a fixed 60 fps rate cannot display a 24 fps movie at an even, judder-free rate. Usually, a 3:2 pulldown is used, giving a slight uneven movement. While common multisync CRT computer monitors have been capable of running at even multiples of 24 Hz since the early 1990s, recent \\"120 Hz\\" LCDs have been produced for the purpose of having smoother, more fluid motion, depending upon the source material, and any subsequent processing done to the signal. In the case of material shot on video, improvements in smoothness just from having a higher refresh rate may be barely noticeable.Six things you need to know about 120Hz LCD TVs In the case of filmed material, as 120 is an even multiple of 24, it is possible to present a 24 fps sequence without judder on a well-designed 120 Hz display (i.e., so-called 5-5 pulldown). If the 120 Hz rate is produced by frame- doubling a 60 fps 3:2 pulldown signal, the uneven motion could still be visible (i.e., so-called 6-4 pulldown). Additionally, material may be displayed with synthetically created smoothness with the addition of motion interpolation abilities to the display, which has an even larger effect on filmed material. \\"50 Hz\\" TV sets (when fed with \\"50 Hz\\" content) usually get a movie that is slightly faster than normal, avoiding any problems with uneven pulldown. == See also == * Plasma display * Comparison of display technology ==References== Category:Television technology Category:Graphics hardware Category:Rates ","title":"Refresh rate"},{"id":"515775","text":"Bellmore may refer to: *The Bellmores, New York (Bellmore and North Bellmore), census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, New York, United States *Bellmore, Indiana, unincorporated community in Union Township, Parke County, Indiana, United States *Bellmore (LIRR station), a train station in Bellmore, New York *6445 Bellmore, an asteroid ==See also== * Belmore (disambiguation) * Bellemore, surname ","title":"Bellmore"},{"id":"515779","text":"The Cuanza River in Angola The Cuanza River, also known as the Coanza, the Quanza, and the Kwanza, is one of the longest rivers in Angola.

Lesage sought a mandate for the nationalization of the electricity industry, with the slogan Maîtres chez nous (Masters in Our Own Home), declaring it a single issue important enough to stake his political career on it. A few days before the election, the Union Nationale's chief organizer André Lagarde was arrested for fraud. The Liberals claimed this was proof of lingering corruption dating from the Maurice Duplessis era, but the UN cried foul and was vindicated after the election. However, the incident may well have contributed to the UN's defeat. The Liberal Party won an increased number of seats and a higher percentage of the popular vote, and the nationalization program was carried out. Future Parti Québécois founder René Lévesque served as a cabinet minister in the Lesage government and spearheaded the nationalization of power utilities for a great expansion of Hydro-Québec. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular vote - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\"1960 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change  Jean Lesage align=\\"right\\"97 align=\\"right\\"51 !align=\\"right\\"63 align=\\"right\\"+23.5% align=\\"right\\"1,205,253 align=\\"right\\" 56.40% align=\\"right\\"+5.0%  Daniel Johnson, Sr. align=\\"right\\"95 align=\\"right\\"43 !align=\\"right\\"31 align=\\"right\\"-27.9% align=\\"right\\"900,817 align=\\"right\\" 42.15% align=\\"right\\"-4.5% colspan=2Other align=\\"right\\"32 align=\\"right\\"1 !align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"30,897 align=\\"right\\" 1.45% align=\\"right\\"-0.6% - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\"224 align=\\"right\\"95 !align=\\"right\\"95 !align=\\"right\\"- !align=\\"right\\"2,136,967 !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"right\\" - } ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * Quiet Revolution * 27th Legislative Assembly of Quebec ==External links== * CBC TV video clip Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ","title":"1962 Quebec general election"},{"id":"515781","text":"The Rotopress is a waste collection vehicle manufactured by the German company Faun Umwelttechnik and formerly by KUKA. It uses a rotating drum to compact waste, and has its origin in a series of designs built by KUKA since the 1920s. The name \\"Rotopress\\" was first used in 1977, and has been used on subsequent models by the company, and by other companies under licence. ==Description== The Rotopress is a continuously compacting garbage truck. A massive rotating drum compacts and stores the garbage. The outer edge of the drum acts as the loading hopper, and paddles on the drum convey the waste around an auger of decreasing pitch until it is small enough to be forced through a small ring-shaped gap between the drum and the auger, where it then enters the main section of the drum, which has helically shaped internal paddles which move the now-crushed waste towards the front of the vehicle. When emptying the drum, the direction of rotation is reversed. ==History== The German company Keller und Knappich, Augsburg (KUKA), founded in 1898, built its first rotary waste collection vehicle in 1927. Production of the original model continued until 1949, and its replacement, the Type 210, was launched the following year. Subsequent models included the \\"Shark\\", introduced to the United States in the 1960s and so-named due to the serrated loading auger which was designed to tear up garbage sacks and other large soft items as they were dragged into the drum. The first model to carry the \\"Rotopress\\" name was the Type 215G, in 1977, and the name has been the company's subsequent rotary- drum designs including the 205. Both the Shark and the Rotopress have been produced under licence by other manufacturers, including the British company, Laird Anglesey Ltd, based in Anglesey. In 1983 KUKA's municipal vehicles division was acquired by Faun GmbH and production was moved to Osterholz. Manufacturing of waste collection vehicles became part of Faun's Environmental Technology sector, which was sold in 1987 to the Schmidt family (former owners of Faun) as a separate company with the name Faun Umwelttechnik. This was acquired by the Kirchhoff group in 1994. Laird Anglesey was acquired by Faun Eurotec, a subsidiary of Faun Umwelttechnik, in 1996. By 1999, over 33,500 Rotopress bodies had been built. One of the key market niches which the Rotopress is aimed at is the collection of Green waste, as the action of the rotary drum system accelerates the homogenization of biodegradable material for composting. There are many available videos on the internet describing the features and operation of the Rotopress, and it had made an appearance at least once on screen, in the 1970 British adaptation of Bartleby. It is visible in operation with the rotating drum prominent and the name Shark above at approx. 48:40. ==Products== As of 2011, the Rotopress is produced a range of sizes from smallest to largest: 008, 514, 516, 518, 520 and 522, as well as the Rotopress Dualpower hybrid vehicle, and the Rotopress 541 which is produced as either a stationary intermediate waste store or a semi-trailer. ==References== ==External links== *FAUN Umwelttechnik: ROTOPRESS Category:Waste collection vehicles ","title":"Rotopress"},{"id":"515788","text":"Electron gun from a cathode ray tube Electron gun from an oscilloscope CRT The electron gun from an RCA Vidicon video camera tube. An electron gun (also called electron emitter) is an electrical component in some vacuum tubes that produces a narrow, collimated electron beam that has a precise kinetic energy. The largest use is in cathode ray tubes (CRTs), used in nearly all television sets, computer displays and oscilloscopes that are not flat-panel displays. They are also used in field emission displays (FEDs), which are essentially flat-panel displays made out of rows of extremely small cathode ray tubes. They are also used in microwave linear beam vacuum tubes such as klystrons, inductive output tubes, travelling wave tubes, and gyrotrons, as well as in scientific instruments such as electron microscopes and particle accelerators. Electron guns may be classified by the type of electric field generation (DC or RF), by emission mechanism (thermionic, photocathode, cold emission, plasmas source), by focusing (pure electrostatic or with magnetic fields), or by the number of electrodes. ==Characteristics== thumb250pxrightSetup of an electron gun with: ➀ Hot cathode ➁ Wehnelt cylinder ➂ Anode Electron gun from a travelling wave tube, cutaway through axis to show construction A direct current, electrostatic thermionic electron gun is formed from several parts: a hot cathode, which is heated to create a stream of electrons via thermionic emission, electrodes generating an electric field to focus the electron beam (such as a Wehnelt cylinder), and one or more anode electrodes which accelerate and further focus the beam. A large voltage difference between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons away from the cathode. A repulsive ring placed between the electrodes focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode, at the expense of a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. There is often a hole through the anode at this small spot, through which the electrons pass to form a collimated beam before reaching a second anode, called the collector. This arrangement is similar to an Einzel lens. Most color cathode ray tubes – such as those used in color televisions – incorporate three electron guns, each one producing a different stream of electrons. Each stream travels through a shadow mask where the electrons will impinge upon either a red, green or blue phosphor to light up a color pixel on the screen. The resultant color that is seen by the viewer will be a combination of these three primary colors. ==Applications of electron guns== The most common use of electron guns is in cathode ray tubes, which were widely used in computer and television monitors until flat-screen displays rendered them obsolete. An electron gun can also be used to ionize particles by adding electrons to, or removing electrons from an atom. This technology is sometimes used in mass spectrometry in a process called electron ionization to ionize vaporized or gaseous particles. More powerful electron guns are used for welding, metal coating, 3D metal printers, metal powder production and vacuum furnaces. Electron guns are also used in medical applications to produce X-rays using a linac (linear accelerator); a high energy electron beam hits a target, stimulating emission of X-rays. Electron guns are also used in travelling wave tube amplifiers for microwave frequencies. ==Measurement and detection== A nanocoulombmeter in combination with a Faraday cup can be used to detect and measure the beams emitted from electron gun and ion guns. Another way to detect electron beams from an electron gun is by using a phosphor screen which will glow when struck by an electron. ==See also== * Optics * Electron beam technology ==References== ==Further reading == * Introduction to Electron Guns for Accelerators Dunham 2008 ==External links== * Simulation of an Electron Gun Interactive tutorial from LMU Munich Category:Electron beam Category:Accelerator physics Category:Vacuum tubes ","title":"Electron gun"},{"id":"515790","text":"The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? is a full-length play written in 2000 by Edward Albee which opened on Broadway in 2002. It won the 2002 Tony Award for Best Play, the 2002 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, and was a finalist for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. ==Overview== The tale of a married, middle- aged architect, Martin, his wife Stevie, and their son Billy, whose lives crumble when Martin falls in love with a goat, the play focuses on the limits of an ostensibly liberal society. Through showing this family in crisis, Albee challenges audience members to question their own moral judgment of social taboos. The play also features many language games and grammatical arguments in the middle of catastrophes and existential disputes between the characters. The name of the play refers to the song \\"Who Is Sylvia?\\" from Shakespeare's play The Two Gentlemen of Verona. Proteus sings this song, hoping to woo Silvia. It is also referred to in Finding the Sun (1982), an earlier work of Albee. ==Characters== * Stevie Gray: the wife of Martin who, until Sylvia, had been his one and only love * Martin Gray: a 50-year-old award-winning architect who falls in love with a goat * Billy Gray: Stevie and Martin's gay, emotionally sensitive, 17-year-old son * Ross Tuttle: a family friend and host of a television program ==Plot Scene 1 === It is Martin's 50th birthday. In his suburban living room, he and his wife Stevie prepare to be interviewed on television by their friend Ross. Martin seems distracted and cannot remember anything. Stevie casually asks Martin about a woman's business card in his pocket and his odd scent. Martin denies having an affair with a woman, but confesses to falling in love with a goat named Sylvia. Stevie laughs it off, thinking it is a joke. Stevie leaves when Ross arrives. Ross begins interviewing Martin, congratulating him for being the youngest man ever to win the Pritzker Prize and recently being chosen to design a multi-billion-dollar city. However, Ross soon becomes frustrated with Martin’s inability to concentrate on the interview. Martin confides that the reason for his absent- mindedness is his affair with Sylvia, which began during his search for a country home. Amazed that Martin could fall in love with anyone but Stevie, Ross asks repeatedly, \\"Who is Sylvia?\\" Martin reveals a photo of Sylvia and Ross screams that Sylvia is a goat. === Scene 2 === Ross has written Stevie a letter regarding Martin's affair and Sylvia's identity. Stevie confronts Martin about this, with their son Billy also in the room. Billy is shocked and flees (throughout this scene, he enters and exits sporadically). Stevie recounts the normalcy of her life before she opened Ross's letter. She realizes that Martin was telling the truth in Scene 1 and that she was right to worry about the business card and the odd scent. The card belongs to a member of a support group for bestiality. Martin claims that people like him seek animal company as a coping mechanism. For him, Sylvia is not just an animal; she has a soul and reciprocates his love. As Martin tries to justify himself, Stevie breaks various objects and overturns furniture. Finally, she exits, vowing revenge. === Scene 3 === Billy enters the ruined living room where Martin remains. Billy claims that Martin and Stevie are good people and are better than most of his classmates' parents. However, he begins crying once he realizes that Martin's bestiality has torn his normal, happy family beyond repair. He then proclaims his love and kisses Martin. Ross comes in and witnesses Billy's kiss. Despite being initially outraged, Martin hugs Billy to comfort him. Martin defends the kiss to a contemptuous Ross, mentioning that a friend had gotten an erection from having his baby on his lap, heavily implying that the \\"friend\\" was Martin. When Ross becomes disgusted, Martin challenges his judgement and objects to his interference with his family. Ross justifies his letter, stating Martin's actions would have brought bad publicity. Stevie returns, dragging a dead goat. She has killed Sylvia because she could not stand the idea that Sylvia loved Martin as much as she (Stevie) did. Ross freezes, Billy cries, and Martin breaks down. ==Tragedy== Albee places parentheses around the play's subtitle: \\"Notes toward a definition of tragedy\\". The original Greek meaning of the word tragedy is \\"goat-song\\". The play maintains Aristotle's six elements of a tragedy in addition to the three unities. The play's resemblance to a Greek tragedy continues as Greek theater is linked to Dionysus. As the god of ritual madness, he inspires ecstasy that frees his followers from fears and subverts hegemony. Bestiality is considered taboo in contemporary society. Martin's relationship with Sylvia then defies convention. Unlike the other members in the support group, Martin does not understand why bestiality is wrong when he practices it devoid of previous trauma. On the other hand, Stevie resembles the maenads with her increasingly frenzied actions. The play also alludes to the Eumenides. Before the interview starts, Ross hears \\"a kind of...rushing sound...wings, or something,\\" to which Martin replies, \\"It's probably the Eumenides.\\" The noise disappears and Martin corrects himself because \\"[the Eumenides] don't stop.\\" The allusion foreshadows Stevie's vow for vengeance, carried out to conclude the play. The Goat is also a problem play. Albee questions, among other concepts, social morality in relation to taboos, the perception of female identity by contrasting Stevie to Sylvia, and the arbitrary nature of social standards and conventions by juxtaposing Martin's distaste for homosexuality with his bestiality. ==Productions== The play premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre on March 10, 2002, and closed on December 15, 2002, after 309 performances and 23 previews.

A member of the Justicialist Party, he was Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers during the entirety of the presidency of Néstor Kirchner and the early months of the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. He won the 2019 general election with 48% of the vote, defeating incumbent President Mauricio Macri. ==Early life and career== Fernández was born in Buenos Aires, son of Celia Pérez and her first husband. Separated from the latter, Celia (sister of the personal photographer of Juan Domingo Perón) married Judge Carlos Pelagio Galíndez (son of a Senator of the Radical Civic Union). Alberto Fernández, who barely knew his biological father, considers Pelagio to be his true father. Alberto Fernández attended Law School at the University of Buenos Aires. He graduated at the age of 24, and later became a professor of criminal law. He entered public service as an adviser to Deliberative Council of Buenos Aires and the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. He became Deputy Director of Legal Affairs of the Economy Ministry, and in this capacity served as chief Argentine negotiator at the GATT Uruguay Round. Nominated by newly elected President Carlos Menem to serve as National Superintendent for Insurance, served as President of the Latin American Insurance Managers' Association from 1989 to 1992, and co-founded the Insurance Managers International Association. He also served as adviser to Mercosur and ALADI on insurance law, and was involved in insurance and health services companies in the private sector. Fernández was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young People of Argentina in 1992, and was awarded the Millennium Award as one of the nation's Businessmen of the Century, among other recognitions. During this time he became politically close to former Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde. Fernández (right) with President Néstor Kirchner and Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana in 2007. He was elected on 7 June 2000, to the Buenos Aires City Legislature on the conservative Action for the Republic ticket led by former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. ==Chief of the Cabinet (2003–2008)== Fernández (right) took oath as the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers under President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner on 10 December 2007 He gave up his seat when he was appointed Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers by President Néstor Kirchner upon taking office on 25 May 2003, and retained the same post under Kirchner's wife and successor, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, upon her election in 2007. A new system of variable taxes on agricultural exports led to the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector, during which Fernández acted as the government's chief negotiator. The negotiations failed, however, and following Vice President Julio Cobos' surprise, tie-breaking vote against the bill in the Senate, Fernández resigned on 23 July 2008. ==Pre-presidency== He was named head of the City of Buenos Aires chapter of the Justicialist Party, but minimized his involvement in Front for Victory campaigns for Congress in 2009. Fernández actively considered seeking the Justicialist Party presidential nomination ahead of the 2011 general elections. He ultimately endorsed President Cristina Kirchner for re-election, however. He was campaign manager of the presidential candidacy of Sergio Massa in 2015. ==Presidential electionsPresidential campaign=== On 18 May 2019, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner announced that Fernández would be a candidate for president, and that she would run for vice president alongside him, hosting his first campaign rally with Santa Cruz Governor Alicia Kirchner, sister-in-law of the former Kirchner. About a month later, seeking to broaden his appeal to moderates, Fernández struck a deal with Sergio Massa to form an alliance called Frente de Todos, wherein Massa would be offered a role within a potential Fernández administration, or be given a key role within the Chamber of Deputies in exchange for dropping out of the presidential race and offering his support. Fernández also earned the endorsement of the General Confederation of Labor, receiving their support in exchange for promising that he will boost the economy, and that there will be no labor reform. ===General elections=== On 11 August 2019, Fernández won first place in the 2019 primary elections, earning 47.7% of the vote, compared to incumbent President Mauricio Macri's 31.8%. Fernández thereafter held a press conference where he said he called Macri to say that he would help Macri complete his term and \\"bring calm to society and markets,\\" and that his economic proposals do not run the risk of defaulting on the national debt. Macri following national elections that took place the previous day. In the 27 October general election, Fernández won the presidency by attaining 48.1% of the vote to Macri's 40.4%, exceeding the threshold required to win without the need for a ballotage. ==PresidencyInauguration=== President Alberto Fernández (left) with his Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (right) Fernández was sworn in on 10 December 2019. ===Economic policy=== On 14 December, the government established by decree the emergency in occupational matters and double compensation for dismissal without just cause for six months. His first legislative initiative, the Social Solidarity and Productive Recovery Bill, was passed by Congress on 23 December. The bill includes tax hikes on foreign currency purchases, agricultural exports, wealth, and car sales - as well as tax incentives for production. Amid the worst recession in nearly two decades, it provides a 180-day freeze on utility rates, bonuses for the nation's retirees and Universal Allocation per Child beneficiaries, and food cards to two million of Argentina's poorest families. It also gave the president additional powers to renegotiate debt terms – with Argentina seeking to restructure its US$100 billion debt with private bondholders and US$45 billion borrowed by Macri from the International Monetary Fund. Organizations of the agricultural sector, including Sociedad Rural Argentina, CONINAGRO, Argentine Agrarian Federation and Argentine Rural Confederations, rejected the increase in taxes on agricultural exports. Despite these conflicts, Fernández announced the three-point increase in withholding tax on soybeans on the day of the opening of the regular sessions, on 1 March and generated major problems in the relationship between the government and the agricultural sector. Argentina defaulted again on May 22, 2020 by failing to pay $500 million on its due date to its creditors. Negotiations for the restructuring of $66 billion of its debt continue. The International Monetary Fund reported that the COVID-19 crisis would plunge Argentina's GDP by 9.9 percent, after the country's economy contracted by 5.4 percent in first quarter of 2020, with unemployment rising over 10.4 percent in the first three months of the year, before the lockdown started. On August 4, Fernández reached an accord with the biggest creditors on terms for a restructuring of $65bn in foreign bonds, after a breakthrough in talks that had at times looked close to collapse since the country's ninth debt default in May. On September 22, official reports showed a 19% year-on-year drop in the GDP for the second quarter of 2020, the biggest drop in the country's history. Investment went down 38% from the previous year. ===Social policy=== On 31 December, Fernández announced that he will send a bill in 2020 to discuss the legalization of abortion, ratified his support for its approval, and expressed his wish for \\"sensible debate”. However, in June 2020 he stated that he was \\"attending to more urgent matters\\" (referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the debt restructuring), and that \\"he'll send the bill at some point\\". On 1 March, he also announced a restructuring of the Federal Intelligence Agency (AFI), including the publications of its accounts - which had been made secret by Macri in a 2016 decree. The AFI had been criticized for targeting public figures for political purposes. On August 17, protests took place in many cities across Argentina against measures taken by Fernández, primarily the Justice Reform Bill his government had sent to the Congress, but also, among other causes: for the \\"defense of institutions\\" and \\"separation of powers\\", against the government's quarantine measures, the perceived lack of liberty and the increase in crime, and a raise on state pensions. ===Foreign relations=== Meeting with Pope Francis on 31 January 2020. His relations are strained with Jair Bolsonaro, who refused to attend his inauguration, accusing him of wanting to create a \\"great Bolivarian homeland\\" on the border and of preparing to provoke a flight of capital and companies into Brazil. Donald Trump's top adviser for the Western Hemisphere, Mauricio Claver, warned him in 2019 saying: \\"We want to know if Alberto Fernández will be a defender of democracy or an apologist for dictatorships and leaders in the region, whether it be Maduro, Correa or Morales.\\" Alberto Fernández questioned the conclusions the Organization of American States that the reelection of Evo Morales was unconstitutional for electoral fraud. Fernández legitimized Morales as President of Bolivia, and granted him asylum in Argentina in December 2019. ===Coronavirus pandemic=== The announcement of the lockdown by Fernández was generally well received, although there were concerns with its economic impact. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fernandez's government announced a country-wide lockdown, in effect from 20 March until 31 March, later extended until 12 April. The lockdown was further renewed on April 27, May 11, May 25, June 8, July 1, July 18, August 3, August 17, August 31 and September 21, and included several measures including travel, transport and citizen movement restrictions, stay-at-home orders, store closures and reduced operating hours. Responses to the outbreak have included restrictions on commerce and movement, closure of borders, and the closure of schools and educational institutions. The announcement of the lockdown was generally well received, although there were concerns with its economic impact in the already delicate state of Argentina's economy, with analysts predicting at least 3% GDP decrease in 2020. Fernandez later announced a 700 billion pesos (US$11.1 billion) stimulus package, worth 2% of the country's GDP. After announced a mandatory quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries, the government closed its borders, ports, and suspended flights. On 23 March, Fernández asked the Chinese president Xi Jinping for 1,500 ventilators as Argentina had only 8,890 available. Included in the package was the announcement of a one-time emergency payment of 10,000 pesos (US$152, as of March 20) to lower-income individuals whose income was affected by the lockdown, including retirees. Because banks were excluded in the list of businesses that were considered essential in Fernandez's lockdown decree, they remained closed until the Central Bank announced banks would open during a weekend starting on 3 April. Due to Argentina's notoriously low level of banking penetration, many Argentines, particularly retirees, do not possess bank accounts and are used to withdraw funds and pensions in cash. The decision to open banks for only three days on a reduced-hours basis sparked widespread outrage as hundreds of thousands of retirees (coronavirus' highest risk group) flocked to bank branches in order to withdraw their monthly pension and emergency payment. Due to the national lockdown, the economical activity suffered a collapse of nearly 10% in March 2020 according to a consultant firm. The highest drop was of the construction sector (32%) versus March 2019. Every economical sector suffered a collapse, with finance, commerce, manufacturing industry and mining being the most affected. The agriculture sector was the least affected, but overall the economic activity for the first trimester of 2020 accumulates a 5% contraction. It is expected that the extension of the lockdown beyond April would increase the collapse of the Argentinian economy. On March, the primary fiscal deficit jumped to US$1,394 million, an 857% increase year-to-year. This was due to the public spending to combat the pandemic and the drop in tax collection due to low activity in a context of social isolation. Despite the government's hard lockdown policy, Fernández has been criticized for not following the appropriate protocols himself. This included traveling throughout the country, taking pictures with large groups of supporters without properly wearing a mask nor respecting social distancing, and holding social gatherings with union leaders. On September 3, despite most local governments still enforcing strict lockdown measures, Fernández stated that \\"there is no lockdown\\", and that such thoughts had \\"been instilled by the opposition\\", as part of a political agenda. ==Controversies== Fernández has engaged in disputes with users on Twitter before his presidency, in which his reactions have been regarded as aggressive or violent by some. Tweets show him responding to other users with expletives such as \\"pelotudo\\" (Argentinian slang for \\"asshole\\"), \\"pajero\\" (\\"wanker\\"), and \\"hijo de puta\\" (\\"son of a bitch\\"), as well as telling a user \\"Faggot [is not] an insult [...] I even think faggots have more dignity than you.\\". He also called presidential candidate José Luis Espert \\"Pajert\\", a word play between his last name and the Argentine slang for \\"wanker\\". In December 2017, he responded to a female Twitter user by saying \\"Girl, what you think doesn't worry me. You better learn how to cook. Maybe then you can do something right. Thinking is not your strong suit\\". In June 2020 he told journalist Cristina Pérez to \\"go read the Constitution\\" after being questioned about his attempts to install a government-designated administration in the Vicentín agricultural conglomerate. ==Personal life== Fernández married a fellow University of Buenos Aires law student, Marcela Luchetti, in 1993. They separated in 2005. Fernández and Luchetti have a single child, Estanislao (born 1994), known in Argentina for being a drag performer and cosplayer who goes by the stage name Dyhzy.

Their music has mixed rock and roll, punk rock, British blues, ska, and new wave. Originally active from 1979 to 1988, they performed at the 2004 Fuji Rock Festival before restarting activities in 2009. Through the years, guitarist Hiroyuki Hanada remained the only constant member, with the band currently consisting of the original lineup. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the Roosters at number 75 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In September 2007, Rolling Stone Japan rated their album Good Dreams number 28 on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time\\". ==History== They formed in 1979 in the Hakata ward of Fukuoka, named after the blues standard \\"Little Red Rooster\\". Although there were four different lineups throughout the life of the band—all centered around guitarist Hiroyuki Hanada--Shinya Oe was the band's first frontman. Oe not only sang lead vocals, but also dominated the writing of lyrics and music for the group for the first three albums. In addition to Oe's contributions, the first two albums were made up of several cover songs. Their third album Insane was a step in a new direction, it was not only the first original Roosters album, but it also featured the first Roosters song not written and composed by Oe: \\"Baby Sitter\\", written and composed by bassist Tomio Inoue. This was the first sign of a more democratic Roosters, and it paved the way for Hanada to compose songs for their fourth album Dis. The Roosters' sixth album φPHY was Oe's last with the group, with only about half of the record credited to him. The rest of the album is credited to Toshiyuki Shibayama for his lyrics and Hanada for his musical compositions. Shibayama continued to write a large portion of the lyrics for the group until they broke up, but never played with them or was an official member. The Roosters appeared, along with other Japanese rock bands, in the 1982 Sogo Ishii film Burst City. In 1985 Shinya Oe decided to take an indefinite break from making music and left the band. Despite losing an integral member of the band the Roosters pressed on and released their seventh album Neon Boy less than nine months after Oe's departure. A single, \\"Out Land\\", was Jun Shimoyama's first contribution as a songwriter and composer for the group. Shimoyama continued to write lyrics and music for the band along with Hanada until the band's dissolution in 1988. In March 1999 a tribute album entitled Respectable Roosters was released and featured bands influenced by The Roosters such as the pillows, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, Supercar, Kemuri and others performing covers of their songs. In the year 2002, four of the original Roosters from various incarnations came together to form the Rock'n'Roll Gypsies. In 2004 Shinya Oe ended his lengthy musical hiatus to reunite with the original lineup of the Roosters to perform at the 2004 Fuji Rock Festival. ==Lineups== #The Roosters (February 1979 - July 1983, 2004, 2009 - present) #*Shinya Oe (大江 慎也 Ōe Shin'ya) - Vocals, Guitar #*Hiroyuki Hanada (花田 裕之 Hanada Hiroyuki) - Lead Guitar #*Tomio Inoue (井上 富雄 Inoue Tomio) - Bass Guitar #*Junzi Ikehata (池畑 潤二 Ikehata Junji) - Drums (Withdrew September 1983) #The Roosterz (July 1983 - March 1985) #*Shinya Oe - Vocals, Guitar #*Hiroyuki Hanada - Lead Guitar #*Jun Shimoyama (下山 淳 Shimoyama Jun) - Lead Guitar #*Tomio Inoue - Bass (Withdrew January 1984) #*Kazuhiko Sakuyama (柞山 一彦 Kazuyama Kazuhiko) - Bass #*Masayuki Nadatomo (灘友 正幸 Nadatomo Masayuki) - Drums #*Koichi Ando (安藤 広一 Andō Kōichi) - Keyboards (Withdrew March 1985) #The Roosterz (March 1985 - December 1987) #*Hiroyuki Hanada - Vocals, Guitar #*Jun Shimoyama - Guitar #*Kazuhiko Sakuyama - Bass Guitar #*Masayuki Nadatomo - Drums #The Roosterz (December 1987 - July 1988) #*Hiroyuki Hanada - Vocals, Guitar #*Jun Shimoyama - Lead Guitar #*Nikichi Anai (穴井 仁吉 Anai Nikichi) - Bass #*Shigeo Mihara (三原 重夫 Mihara Shigeo) - Drums :Romanization Note: There are three members of the Roosters who prefer irregular romanizations of their names, Shinya Oe, Junzi Ikehata and Koichi Ando.

Big Pussy was a longtime close friend and mob enforcer for Tony Soprano, and was also shown to be close friends with fellow DiMeo crime family mobsters Paulie \\"Paulie Walnuts\\" Gualtieri, Silvio Dante, and was once a close friend to Tony's uncle Corrado \\"Junior\\" Soprano. The son of Lino Bonpensiero,Rucker, Allen & David Chase. The Sopranos, A Family History. New York, American Library, 2003 Salvatore Bonpensiero started out as a cat burglar, and was affectionately known as Pussy, in reference to a pussycat. He was called \\"Big Pussy\\" to distinguish from Gennaro \\"Little Pussy\\" Malanga. Sal had a wife Angie and three children. He operated an auto body shop with his brother Edward \\"Duke\\" Bonpensiero. He was an associate of Tony's father, John Francis \\"Johnny Boy\\" Soprano until he supported Johnny during the unrest of 1983. Sal was a soldier in the Soprano crew, and he backed Johnny's wishes to have Tony Soprano become capo following Johnny's death in 1986. In order to put his children through college, he dealt heroin on the side. He was caught by the FBI and forced to inform against the Soprano crew, in order to avoid the possibility of life in prison. He was assigned Agent Skip Lipari as his handler. He was revealed as an informant in the episode \\"Do Not Resuscitate\\". In flashbacks to 1995, it is shown that Sal was instrumental in organizing a sit-down between high ranking capo Junior Soprano and acting boss Jackie Aprile Sr. He traveled to Boca Raton to persuade Junior to return to New Jersey and settle a trucking dispute with Aprile. However, he was suspiciously late for the sit-down and blamed health problems of his comare's mother. In 1999, he was arrested at a card game run by Soprano family capo Jimmy Altieri. He tried to escape but threw his back out and was caught. He was quickly bailed out, but was confined to his house due to injury. Dirty cop Vin Makazian told Tony he had a rat in his organization and pointed the finger at Sal. Tony assigned Paulie Gualtieri to investigate, and to kill Sal, but only if he explicitly saw proof. At a bath house with Paulie, Sal refused to undress because he was wearing a wire, blaming high blood pressure, which raised the crew's suspicions further, especially after he then disappeared. Paulie took over his collections, and the crew killed Altieri, taking the heat off Sal, as the crew figured the rat was flushed. Sal resurfaced at Tony's home in 2000, claiming to have been in Puerto Rico receiving treatment for his bad back from an acupuncturist. He started lying to Agent Lipari, showing reluctance to divulge details. He was spotted with Agent Lipari by an acquaintance Jimmy Bones, and later murdered Bones at his home, for fear of being revealed. When Sal returned, he and his wife Angie began having marital issues. Angie discussed leaving him with Carmela Soprano, who dissuaded her, so she settled for sleeping in separate bedrooms. When Tony became acting boss, he made Silvio his consigliere, and Paulie a capo, with new addition Furio Giunta on equal footing with Sal despite Sal's years of service. Sal wore a wire to A.J.'s confirmation, but he spent most of the time privately counselling A.J., instead of talking business with the crew. Following Christopher Moltisanti's shooting by associates Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, Sal resumed his loyal soldier role despite his double life as an informant; he tracked down the escaped Bevilaqua, and shot him to death with Tony. Sal eventually gave Agent Lipari information on Soprano's stolen airline tickets scam, leading to Tony's brief arrest. Tony eventually accepted his suspicions about Sal after a portentous dream where Sal appeared to him as a talking fish, a clear reference to the Mafia-related saying \\"sleep with the fishes\\". To be certain, he searched for evidence in Sal's home, and found a wire in a cigar box. He then organized a hit on Sal, with Silvio and Paulie, on a boat, with one last toast to the good times, and the three shot him to death, wrapped his body in plastic bags, chains, and weights and dumped it into the ocean. Sal would make several appearances in the show after his death in dreams and flashbacks. Silvio Dante Anthony \\"A.J.\\" Soprano Jr. Meadow Soprano Paulie \\"Walnuts\\" Gualtieri Livia Soprano Adriana La Cerva Richie Aprile Richie Aprile is played by David Proval. Richie is the older brother of acting DiMeo crime family boss Jackie Aprile Sr., was a capo in the DiMeo crime family before being sent to prison for ten years. Richie was previously married and fathered a son, Richie Aprile Jr. Richie returned from prison to a very different family, with Tony Soprano as the boss, whom Richie had known since before Tony had become a made man. Richie feels he is entitled to more control and a higher ranking position in the family for having paid his dues in prison. Tony promises to give Richie his due, an offer which Richie immediately rebuffs, saying Tony does not have the authority to do it. Richie's tensions with Tony escalate throughout Season 2. One of Richie's first actions as a free man is to confront his old partner Peter \\"Beansie\\" Gaeta and try to claim money from him out of his legitimate business investments. Later, Richie, waiting in his car, waits for Beansie to approach his car in the parking lot, then rams Beansie with his car, crushing Beansie between the two vehicles. Richie then drives over Beansie's legs as he leaves. Richie dislikes Tony's protégé Christopher Moltisanti because of his violent relationship with Richie's niece, Adriana La Cerva, and warns Christopher of the consequences should he ever hit her again. Christopher's two young associates, Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, learn of Richie's dislike for their boss, and shoot Christopher, hoping to impress Richie. The shooting goes wrong, however, and Christopher survives. Richie had nothing to do with planning the hit, and when he learns of it, he refuses to help Bevilaqua and chases him off his premises. Richie and Janice Soprano, Tony's sister, used to date in high school. When Richie gets out of prison, he and Janice resume their old relationship and eventually get engaged. Janice frequently encourages Richie to defy Tony, because she wants to be married to the boss. In the end, Richie prepares, with the approval of Tony's Uncle Junior, to take over the family as boss. Richie approaches acting capo Albert \\"Ally Boy\\" Barese to ask for his support in his takeover bid, but he declines. After weighing his options, Junior realizes he is better off with Tony in charge and tips him off about Richie's plans. Silvio Dante advises Tony that there is nothing to gain from leaving Richie alive, so Tony instructs Silvio to have Richie killed. However, after returning home one night, Richie gets into an argument with Janice over Richie's son's possible homosexuality. Richie is enraged at the thought of his son being gay, but Janice replies that it would not matter. Furious, Richie punches her in the mouth before settling down for dinner. Janice leaves the room and returns with a gun pointed at him. Calmly, Richie says, \\"Get the fuck outta here. I'm in no mood for your...\\" before she shoots Richie twice, killing him. Distraught, she calls Tony, who has Christopher and Furio Giunta meet him at Livia's (where Janice, Richie and Livia reside) to remove Richie's body. They bring him to Satriale's to dismember his corpse and Tony sends Janice off to Seattle to lay low. Janice Soprano Artie Bucco Arthur \\"Artie\\" Bucco Jr. is played by John Ventimiglia. Artie is a restaurateur and chef, and childhood friend of Tony Soprano's, attending the same elementary school together. Artie appears throughout the series, from the first episode to the penultimate episode. He and his wife, Charmaine Bucco, have three children Chiara Bucco, Melissa Bucco, and Arthur \\"Art\\" Bucco III. Charmaine is frequently concerned about his attraction to Tony's criminal life, and often warns Artie about his occasional attempts at involvement. Despite Artie and Tony's close friendship, their relationship sees several low points. At the end of Season 1, Artie learns from Tony's mother, Livia, that Tony was responsible for the arson at his original restaurant co-owned with his wife, Vesuvio, in Essex County, New Jersey. Tony's Uncle Junior had planned to stage a hit at Vesuvio on Little Pussy\\" Malanga, despite Tony's repeated requests to move the location of the hit. Tony, knowing that the restaurant's patrons would be permanently chased away if a hit occurred there, set the restaurant ablaze so that the hit would be avoided and Artie could rebuild the restaurant with the payout from his insurance policy. Artie rebuilds the restaurant renaming it, Nuovo Vesuvio. However, Artie had a strong emotional attachment to the old restaurant, which he inherited from his father, confronts Tony with a hunting rifle in the parking lot of Satriale's when he finds out that Tony was responsible. Eventually, Artie believes Tony's repeated denials of having been the arsonist. There is a brief tension between the two, but by the end of the Season 1 finale, they have made up. In season 4, Artie is approached by Frenchman Jean-Philippe, the brother of the new hostess at Vesuvio, for a $50,000 short-term loan to distribute Armagnac in the US. Artie agrees to lend him the money at high interest. He tries to borrow the money from Ralph, who declines but mentions it to Tony, who reminds Artie of their friendship and insists that he accept the loan from him. Ten days pass and Jean-Philippe is not answering the phone. Artie goes to his home; Jean-Philippe says plainly that the deal has failed and there is no money. Artie attacks him. Jean-Philippe gets the better of him, rips out his earring and throws him out. At home, Artie overdoses on alcohol and pills and calls Tony to apologize. Tony deduces that his friend is trying to kill himself and calls 911. At the hospital, Tony says that Artie can clear his $6,000 tab at Nuovo Vesuvio in lieu of payment. Artie expresses admiration that Tony could intuitively foresee that the deal would go bad and so he would be able to profit from it; this makes Tony furious. Someone rings the bell at Jean-Philippe's apartment. He opens the door: it is Furio. In the third episode of Season 5, Tony learns that Artie has been living in a Motel 6 since the separation from his wife. Tony offers to let Artie stay in his mother's old house, where Tony has been living since his separation from Carmela. Artie accepts, and the old friends reconcile. By Season 6, Artie and Charmaine have reconciled. There is a growing sense of dissatisfaction amongst Nuovo Vesuvio's diners, culminating in the episode \\"Luxury Lounge\\". Artie has hired another young hostess that he lusts after—Martina, an undocumented Albanian immigrant he has been helping through the U.S. government's immigration process. Soprano crew associate Benny Fazio is a regular fixture at the restaurant's bar, flirting with Martina. The restaurant is losing many customers to the new rival restaurant, Da Giovanni's. Nuovo Vesuvio's finances worsen when American Express will not let its customers use its cards there, because several account numbers have already been stolen there and fraudulently misused to run up charges elsewhere. Artie confronts Martina, who instantly breaks, tearfully admitting to stealing, then passing, the charge card numbers to Benny. Artie is enraged and storms to Benny's house in the middle of the night. Benny tries to deny his involvement, and Artie starts a brawl, knocking Benny unconscious on his front porch. A furious Benny tells Tony he wants Artie dead, but Tony is able to keep him from doing so. In 2007, Artie appears to have dealt with his personal issues and worked to restore his business. Artie had also catered Christopher Moltisanti's belated bachelor party at Nuovo Vesuvio without coming into confrontation with Benny. Charmaine Bucco Charmaine Bucco is played by Kathrine Narducci. Charmaine is the wife of Artie Bucco and a childhood friend of Carmela and Tony Soprano. She co-owns the restaurant Nuovo Vesuvio with her husband. Charmaine runs the front-of-the-house, and Artie is the head chef. Charmaine's education is referenced periodically in the series: in The Test Dream it is revealed that she is a licensed notary public and in Everybody Hurts it is revealed that she went to the Wharton School of Business. She and her husband have three children Chiara Bucco, Melissa Bucco, and Arthur \\"Art\\" Bucco III. In season one, Charmaine and Carmela drift apart. Charmaine resents that Carmela enjoys an affluent lifestyle that is only made possible by her husband's criminal activities. She discourages Artie from associating with Tony because of his criminal lifestyle. When Carmela hires the Buccos to cater a silent auction fundraiser at the Soprano home, Carmela treats Charmaine like a servant, prompting Charmaine to reveal that she had dated and had sex with Tony in high school at the same time he was beginning to date Carmela when she was spending the summer with her parents on Long Beach Island. Following a series of escalating arguments, Artie and Charmaine finally separate. Artie moves out of the family home, but the two still reluctantly run the business together. Charmaine ultimately reconciles with Artie in season six. Ralph Cifaretto Ralph Cifaretto is played by Joe Pantoliano. Ralph is not present in season 1 or 2, as he spends a prolonged period of time in Miami, Florida and lived in Delray Beach, Florida. Ralph first appears as a soldier in the Aprile Crew in the second episode of season 3, \\"Proshai, Livushka\\". He is characterized as an excellent earner but also unstable and prone to violence. He returned to New Jersey in 2000, following the disappearance of Richie Aprile. As a high-ranking soldier, he tried to take over the crew despite Tony's reluctance to make him captain, and often referred to it as \\"my crew\\". Tony viewed Ralph as obnoxious and insubordinate, so he passed Ralph over for promotion, and made Gigi Cestone captain of the Aprile crew. After Cestone dies of a heart attack, Tony reluctantly installs Ralph as capo. In the episode \\"University\\", Ralph is involved with a 19-year-old stripper named Tracee, who becomes pregnant with Ralph's child. At the Bing, Tracee insults Ralph in front of his friends, and particularly, makes fun of his perceived lack of masculinity. He follows her outside, where they argue. Ralph sweet talks Tracee by telling her of a romantic future with their child which makes her happy, only for Ralph to insult her by telling her if their child is a girl, she will name her \\"Tracee\\" because she is going to become a \\"cocksucking slob, just like her mother.\\" Tracee spits at him and slaps him in retaliation, and he brutally beats her to death. Tony finds out and strikes him repeatedly. Ralph defends himself by shouting, \\"I'm a made guy!\\" Tony justifies his actions by saying that Ralph \\"disrespected the Bing\\". Johnny Sack, a high ranking member in the Lupertazzi family, once ordered a hit on Ralph Cifaretto for making an off-color joke about his wife's obesity, although he later cooled down and called it off. Although unknown to Johnny, his own hit was approved by Tony and Carmine to hit Johnny in order to protect the highly valuable Esplanade project to which Ralphie's involvement was key. Ralph purchases a prize race horse from Hesh Rabkin named Pie-O-My. While Ralph only cares about the horse as a means to make money, Tony becomes emotionally attached to the horse. When Ralph's son Justin is accidentally impaled in the chest with an arrow as part of a game, Ralph is devastated and turns to Father Intintola for guidance. After Pie-O-My dies in a stable fire under questionable circumstances, Tony confronts Ralph over the suspicious timing of the fire with the $200,000 insurance pay out, which was also his son's required medical expenses. Ralph denies the accusation, and rebukes and mocks Tony for being emotionally attached to the horse. A fight ensues in which Tony beats and strangles Ralph to death at his home. Tony calls Christopher to dispose of the body. Chris dismembers Ralph's body in his bathtub with a meat cleaver, after which he and Tony bury Ralph's severed head, toupee, and hands on a farm inside a bowling bag, and sink the rest of Ralph's remains in a flooded quarry after throwing his body off a cliff into the water below. Eugene Pontecorvo Eugene Pontecorvo is played by Robert Funaro. Eugene was a made man in the Soprano crew. Hesh Rabkin mentions to Soprano family members that Eugene's father committed suicide by inert gas asphyxiation in his vehicle at 52-years-old. It is implied he is from North Bergen, New Jersey. Eugene was introduced on the show as an associate in the Soprano crime family in the episode \\"Proshai, Livushka\\". Eugene subsequently becomes a made man in the following episode \\"Fortunate Son\\" along with Christopher Moltisanti. In season six's premiere episode \\"Members Only\\", Eugene inherited $2 million from his deceased aunt. He begins developing serious stress with his home life due to his wife pushing him to talk Tony into their retiring to Fort Myers, Florida. When Eugene discusses this with Tony, he says he would think about it, but he states Eugene took an oath indicating that it is unlikely he would approve. He attempts to bribe Tony with David Yurman watches for Tony, Carmela, Meadow and A.J. He again tries to coax Tony by handing him over a share of the inheritance. Christopher Moltisanti assigns Eugene the task of killing Teddy Spirodakis in Boston who owed Christopher money and failed to pay him. Eugene is reluctant, but must follow Christopher's order due to his rank of capo. Chris assures Eugene that he will put in a good word for him to Tony as a favor for doing the hit. Eugene drives to Boston and finds Teddy eating dinner at a fast food restaurant and shoots him repeatedly in the head. Eugene then walks out calmly. It is revealed Eugene has been an informant and cooperating witness for the F.B.I., though it is unclear for how long. After Ray Curto dies of a massive stroke while giving potentially damaging information to Agent Robyn Sanseverino about Tony discussing a murder, the FBI informs Eugene they also refuse his notion to move to Florida, as they need him as a material witness in New Jersey to help build a case against Tony in the wake of Curto's death. Silvio informs Gene that Tony denied his request to move to Florida. With Tony and the FBI both hindering his family's chance to escape the mafia life, coupled with his stress at home, Eugene hangs himself in his basement. Robert \\"Bobby Bacala\\" Baccalieri Jr. Furio Giunta Furio Giunta is played by Federico Castelluccio. Furio is an Italian gangster, referred to as a zip, working for Tony Soprano. Furio first appears in season 2 in \\"Commendatori\\" as Tony's contact when visiting Italy who speaks both Italian and English. In Italy, Tony negotiates with the Neapolitan Camorra crime boss Annalisa Zucca for Furio to be transferred to New Jersey to work for him as part of an international car theft operation deal. In order to get Furio a visa, Tony initially gets him a job as a mozzarella maker in the Nuovo Vesuvio Restaurant, enticing Artie Bucco with the idea that Tony will pay Furio's salary and he does not have to be on the restaurant's payroll. Furio also became one of Tony's most feared enforcers, intimidating and beating up multiple people who owed Tony money, as well as acting as Tony's driver and bodyguard. Furio's first assignment was to extract payment from a massage parlor owner whose wife had convinced him to withhold payment. He broke the owner's arm with a baseball bat and shot him in the kneecap—all of which made a positive impression on Tony. In season 3 in \\"Amour Fou\\", Furio is shot in the leg by Jackie Aprile Jr. while Jackie and his friends Dino Zerilli and Carlo Renzi robbed Ralph Cifaretto's card game in an attempt to gain recognition amongst the crime family. In season 4 in \\"Everybody Hurts\\", a sly Frenchman named Jean-Philippe talks Artie Bucco into temporarily lending him $50,000 for a business venture to distribute Armagnac in the US. Artie borrows the money from Tony Soprano, but when Artie goes to Jean-Philippe's apartment to collect the money, he claims he does not have it and does not know when or if he is going to get it. Artie and Jean-Philippe scuffle briefly, but Artie leaves bruised and bloodied. Furio is later tasked with reclaiming Tony's assumed debt from Jean-Philippe. Furio eventually became infatuated with Tony's wife, Carmela, who also shares the same feelings. The two never truly became romantically entwined, which creates significant sexual tension between them. Carmela repeatably found excuses to visit Furio including assisting him in buying and decorating a house, and planning a house-warming party. At the house-warming they shared a sexually charged dance, Furio later claims he forgot his sunglasses at the Soprano house, just as a ploy to talk with Carmela. When Furio's father dies, he returned to Italy for the funeral. He sought the advice of his uncle, another Mafia member, telling him that Italy no longer felt like home and that he was in love with his boss's wife, feeling that they could truly communicate. His uncle made it clear he had to move on or kill his boss. In the season 4 penultimate episode \\"Eloise\\", Furio witnesses Tony's infidelity first hand on a night out at a casino. A helicopter had been arranged to take them home and while Tony was urinating on the tarmac, Furio suddenly grabs him by his jacket and contemplates pushing Tony into the rear rotor blades of the helicopter. \\"What the fuck you doin'?!\\" exclaimed Tony in a very inebriated voice. Furio then pulls him away and plays if off by telling Tony \\"You were standing too close...\\" Furio, no longer able to bear the burden that the internal conflict is causing him (that of his feelings conflicting with his honor, as well as his respect to the \\"family\\" hierarchy), sells his house and moves back to Italy. Carmela was devastated, and eventually revealed her feelings for him in an argument with Tony, to which Tony replies \\"If certain men see him, he's a dead man\\". In season 5, it is said that Tony has men looking for him in Italy. However, it is never stated whether Furio was found. John \\"Johnny Sack\\" Sacrimoni John \\"Johnny Sack\\" Sacrimoni is played by Vincent Curatola. Johnny Sack was the longtime underboss and later the boss of the Brooklyn- based Lupertazzi crime family. He operates out of his Essany Scaffolding (until he is given a severance package) or Little Italy, Manhattan social Club, and was a major player in the New York crime family formerly led by Carmine Lupertazzi. Johnny was Carmine's Underboss for many years, handling political payoffs and bid-rigging for the organization. He ultimately became boss after Carmine's death. Johnny was also a friend of Tony Soprano. His wife Ginny was obese, and he became violently angry when any remarks were made about her weight. He once ordered a hit on Ralph Cifaretto for making one such off-color joke, although he later cooled down and called it off. Although unknown to Johnny, his own hit was approved by Tony and Carmine to hit Johnny in order to protect the highly valuable Esplanade project to which Ralphie's involvement was key. Johnny cultivated a friendship with Paulie Gualtieri, making use of him as a source of information about Soprano family business. The relationship began when Paulie felt sidelined by Tony over the esplanade construction project and proved most fruitful when Paulie was imprisoned in 2002 — a time when he felt particularly neglected by his friends. Johnny lied to Paulie — telling him that Carmine held him in high regard and often asked about him. This encouraged Paulie to place more faith in his friendship with Johnny than in the loyalty of his friends in the Soprano crime family. Through Paulie, Johnny learned about Tony's Frelinghuysen Avenue property windfall and HUD scam — allowing the Lupertazzi crime family to demand a piece of the action because their mutual interests made both projects possible. It was also Paulie who told John about the insult that Ralphie made about his wife. However, after a chance meeting with Carmine, Paulie discovered that Carmine did not even know who he was. Angered by John's deceit, Paulie became one of his biggest detractors. Following the natural death of Carmine in 2004, Johnny's crew engaged in a bitter war over the family leadership with Carmine's son, Little Carmine. More violence was threatened upon Tony Soprano's New Jersey family following the unauthorized murder of two of Johnny's men by Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto, on Little Carmine's behalf. After both New York factions suffered heavy casualties, the conflict was brought to an end with Little Carmine surrendering control of the family. This was followed by a tentative reconciliation with Tony, who had personally taken the life of Blundetto to bury the hatchet. However, the moment was cut short when Johnny was promptly arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the family's consigliere, Jimmy Petrille, turned state's evidence. Even while in jail awaiting trial he remained in control of the Lupertazzi family. In the sixth season, Johnny entrusted Phil Leotardo with the role of acting boss while he was in jail. Johnny's brother-in-law Anthony Infante acted as a back channel for communications to reach him while he was imprisoned. His wife remained supportive, often visiting him in prison. Johnny was portrayed as becoming more selfish while imprisoned — he commonly disregards the problems of others stating that his \\"situation\\" should take precedence. He ordered Phil to maintain a good relationship with Tony and avoid starting a war over any business disputes, particularly the new office park construction project – another shared venture like the esplanade project. Johnny was granted a release from prison to attend his daughter Allegra's wedding. However, he had to cover the cost of U.S. Marshals and metal detectors for the wedding and would have 6 hours maximum. When the time came for Johnny to leave the wedding he was reluctant to go — he wanted to wait until his daughter and her new groom left. However, the marshals blocked her limousine and dragged Johnny away in handcuffs, causing him to break down in tears. Johnny used Tony to help plan a hit on Rusty Millio. Johnny again reached out to Tony for help, this time with his financial situation. Johnny elected to use his brother-in- law Anthony as a go-between instead of Phil. Johnny's efforts to maintain control of his family ultimately proved futile. His lawyer, Ron Perse, floated the possibility of cooperating with the FBI, but John was quick to dismiss this. However, as the trial neared, Ron arranged a deal with the government on Johnny's behalf. Facing a massive asset seizure that would have left both him and beloved wife destitute and a case he could not possibly beat, Johnny pleaded guilty to 47 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) predicates for a reduced sentence of 15 years and a fine of 4.2 million dollars — effectively ending his position as boss (but still leaving Ginny enough money to live comfortably). As part of the deal, he was also required to give an allocution admitting his involvement in organized crime (although he did not reveal the names of any associates). Members of both the Soprano and Lupertazzi families were angered by his allocution, believing that John should have stood trial before admitting anything regarding La Cosa Nostra. Johnny was now serving 15 years in federal prison, and was considered persona non grata among his former associates. During his incarceration, Johnny developed lung cancer. He died at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri not long after receiving a grim prognosis from an oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Phil subsequently took over the Lupertazzi family. Vito Spatafore Vito Spatafore Sr. is played by Joseph R. Gannascoli. Vito was a member of the DiMeo crime family and a subordinate of Tony Soprano. He was married to Marie Spatafore, who was a second cousin to high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi family, Phil Leotardo, with two children, Vito Jr. and Francesca. In the fifth season, it was revealed that Vito was a closeted homosexual. Vito's character is based on Vito Arena, a homosexual member in the Gambino crime family. Although Vito Spatafore was not introduced on The Sopranos until the Season 2 episode \\"The Happy Wanderer\\" as a nephew to fellow mobster Richie Aprile and cousin to Adriana La Cerva and Jackie Aprile Jr., the actor who plays his role, Joseph R. Gannascoli, appeared in the Season 1 episode, \\"The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti\\" as pastry shop patron named \\"Gino\\". Vito is a member of the Aprile crew upon Richie's release from prison and quickly rises through the ranks to capo after the deaths of capos Richie Aprile, Gigi Cestone and Ralph Cifaretto. In the season 3 episode \\"Another Toothpick\\", Vito's brother, Bryan Spatafore, is violently beaten with a golf club by Salvatore \\"Mustang Sally\\" Intile, and put into a coma. Vito is vindictive and demands someone render Sal's comeuppance. Tony Soprano enlists in the help of Bobby Baccalieri's father, Bobby Baccalieri Sr., to perform the hit on Mustang Sally. In 2001, in the season 3 finale episode \\"Army of One\\", after Jackie Aprile Jr. had gone into hiding after he and his friends robbed Ralph Cifaretto's card game to gain notoriety. Tony and Ralph agree that Aprile Jr. be killed. Vito performs his first on-screen murder by shooting Jackie Jr. in the back of the head. In 2002, in the season 4 episode \\"Whoever Did This\\", Tony kills Cifaretto after he figures that Ralph was responsible for the death of their prized racehorse Pie-O-My for insurance money. Vito is subsequently promoted to capo of the Aprile Crew, as he was second-in-command. In 2004, in the season 5 episode \\"Unidentified Black Males\\", Vito was caught in the car of the security guard giving him oral sex early one morning at the Esplanade construction site by Meadow's boyfriend, Finn DeTrolio. Vito intimidates Finn into silence. By the season 6 premiere \\"Members Only\\" in 2006, Vito has lost over 160 pounds to appear for a weight loss commercial. In the episode \\"Mr. & Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request\\", during the wedding of Johnny Sack's daughter, Allegra, Vito claimed he was not feeling well, and he and his family left the wedding. Back at home, Vito informed his wife he had to \\"make some collections.\\" Later, that night, while making a collection at a gay bar, two Lupertazzi family associates saw Vito in a leather chaps dancing and kissing a man. Vito attempted to play it off as a joke, but the two men were not convinced. Petrified of the consequences if his homosexuality were made public, Vito went into hiding. He stayed at a bed-and-breakfast in the fictional town of Dartford, New Hampshire, and tried to pursue a new life away from the Mafia. Under the alias \\"Vincent,\\" he claimed to be writing a book. He contacted his family only once during a brief phone call. Discussing Vito with Carlo Gervasi, Tony says that Vito is a top earner for the family, and debates letting him come back to the family. In New Hampshire, Vito develops a relationship with Jim \\"Johnny Cakes\\" Witowski who works as a volunteer fireman and as a short order cook at a diner. Vito introduces himself initially as a sportswriter named Vincent from Scottsdale, Arizona and that he's been divorced for a few years. He also had attempted to live a heterosexual lifestyle and fathered one daughter with his wife. Vito and Jim soon form an attraction, though the two got into a fistfight outside a bar when Jim tried to kiss Vito and, still in denial about his homosexuality, Vito violently rebuffed him, calling him a fag. The two soon reconcile after Vito decides to \\"stop living a lie\\" and became Jim's live-in lover. The pair enjoyed romantic dinners, motorcycle rides, and picnicking lakeside. Jim gets Vito a job as a contractor working for some of his friends, a job which turns out to be very slow-paced. Ultimately, Vito missed his family and fast-paced lifestyle back in New Jersey too much to stay with Jim. Vito left Jim's house early one morning to return to New Jersey while Jim was still asleep. While driving back to New Jersey, a drunk Vito crashed his car into a parked vehicle. When he failed to convince the owner to keep the accident from the police, Vito shot and killed the man. Vito returned home and remained conflicted about whether or not to re-initiate contact with his old mafia family. Vito also later calls Jim, but Jim was still angry over the way Vito had left and wanted nothing more to do with him. Vito eventually approached Tony at a mall, while Vito's brother, Bryan, kept watch. Vito claimed that his homosexual behavior had been caused by medication. Wanting to \\"buy himself back\\" into the business, he offered Tony $200,000 and said he would run the family's Atlantic City prostitution and drug businesses. Tony was tempted by the offer, but realized this would bring him into open war with the Lupertazzis. Lupertazzi crime family boss Phil Leotardo, who disliked homosexuals, and who is a second cousin of Vito's wife Marie, demanded Vito's death, so Tony quietly arranged for Carlo Gervasi to make a hit on Vito. Meanwhile, Vito reunited with his family. He explained his absence to his children by claiming that he was an undercover CIA agent hiding out in Afghanistan, and warned them not to tell anybody. That night, Vito returned to his motel room, and was ambushed by Phil Leotardo and two of his soldiers, Gerry Torciano and \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamiello. Torciano and Gamiello duct-taped Vito's mouth shut, and beat him to death with pool cues while Phil Leotardo watched. It was later revealed that Vito was found with a pool cue inserted into his anus, a message that he was killed because of his homosexuality. Phil's unsanctioned murder of Vito proved to be a serious point of contention in his working relationship with Tony. The relationship was further strained when Phil correctly suspected the New Jersey mob in the disappearance of Gamiello, who had been killed by Silvio and Carlo Gervasi after making repeated wisecracks, in the wake of Vito's death, about the sexual orientation of New Jersey mobsters and Carlo in particular. Phil Leotardo later told Vito's wife, Marie, that her husband was probably killed by two homosexual transients Vito had picked up at a bar. He told Marie that he loved Vito \\"like a brother-in- law,\\" and suggested that Vito's death was probably for the best because a homosexual man would have made a poor role model for the children. However, a newspaper reported Vito was killed by mobsters after requesting to live an openly gay lifestyle. Vito's children read the story, destroying the illusion of their father being a CIA agent. A year later Vito's son, Vito Jr. began to go through a rebellious phase in reaction to his father's murder and cruelty from his peers in light of his father's sexual orientation, entering the Goth subculture and performing various acts of vandalism. His mother, Marie, asked Tony Soprano for money so she could relocate her family to Maine, where no one would know them or what happened to Vito. Tony asked Phil Leotardo to also intervene, because of his involvement in Vito's death. Both paid separate visits to Vito Jr. and told him to start acting more like an adult. But Vito Jr. continued to act out, eventually to the point of getting expelled from school, so Tony decided to pay for the Spatafores to move. However, after gambling away most of the money he planned to give them, Tony instead paid for Vito Jr. to attend a boot camp for delinquents in Boise County, Idaho. Tony Blundetto Anthony \\"Tony B\\" Blundetto is played by Steve Buscemi. He is Tony Soprano's cousin who is released from prison at the beginning of the show's fifth season. Upon release, Tony Blundetto begins to pursue a straight, non-criminal life. His second wife Gwen works in the field of actuarial science. However, he is eventually overpowered by the challenges of civilian life and turns back to crime, dragging the DiMeo crime family into the Lupertazzi crime family's power struggle. Blundetto is introduced in the second episode of season 5, \\"Rat Pack\\". Born in 1958, he is a cousin of Tony Soprano and Christopher Moltisanti. To distinguish between them, they were called \\"Tony Uncle Johnny\\" (Soprano) and \\"Tony Uncle Al\\" (Blundetto) when they were kids, after their fathers' first names. Blundetto, Soprano, and Moltisanti all grew up and played on a farm owned by their uncle, Pat Blundetto. Growing up, both Tonys were very close and Blundetto told Moltisanti that he loved Soprano like a brother. The two Tonys would often bully Moltisanti. Blundetto is the father of Kelli Blundetto, who is Meadow's contemporary and is said to have run away from home, and identical twin boys Justin and Jason Blundetto, whom he fathered by having Tony Soprano smuggle his semen out of prison nine years before, while still incarcerated. In the episode \\"Unidentified Black Males\\", it is also revealed that he has a genius level I.Q. of 158. He sports a large number of crude prison tattoos, on his forearms, biceps, chest, back, and legs including the name of his daughter Kelly and a tattoo representing the Roman god Mercury. Blundetto had a ruthless reputation in his younger years as an enforcer. In 1986, at age 28, Blundetto was arrested, tried, and incarcerated for almost 17 years for the armed hijacking of a truck that was attached to a larger RICO racketeering trial. Soprano was supposed to go along with his cousin the night of the hijacking but was not able to make it due to a severe panic attack caused by an argument with his mother, during which he passed out and injured his head. Soprano tells Blundetto he was mugged by a group of black men the night of the hijacking, and was knocked unconscious. Soprano strongly believes Blundetto holds some ill-will towards him because Blundetto's life and family fell apart during his incarceration while Soprano grows wealthy and has a family. Blundetto denies this ill will, but Tony still harbors enormous guilt. In 2004, Blundetto is released from Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood. After Blundetto's parole, he decides not to return to a life of crime and has the incentive to stay straight and clean. Instead, he initially decides to go into massage therapy. Tony is seemingly disappointed that Blundetto has decided to pursue a legitimate career after he declines Soprano's offer to get start working with the DiMeo crime family in a stolen airbag scheme, but Soprano respects his cousin's decision. Soprano gets his cousin a job working for a laundry company in Rutherford, New Jersey owned by a Korean man named Kim. He later goes into business with him in preparing to open a massage parlor. In an arbitrary fit of rage, he beats Kim. Blundetto then meets Soprano to restart work for the crime family under Carlo Gervasi's crew. Little Carmine's crew simultaneously begins courting Blundetto through his old prison buddy, Angelo Garepe. Female loan shark Lorraine Calluzzo and her boyfriend/enforcer are killed by Phil Leotardo, his brother Billy and crew member Joey Peeps for siding with Little Carmine during the Lupertazzi power struggle between Carmine and Johnny Sack. In retaliation, Little Carmine loyalists Rusty Millio and Angelo Garepe offer a contract to Blundetto to murder Joey Peeps (\\"Marco Polo\\"). Although he is reluctant at first, he later accepts the contract after he decided that he is not moving up fast enough in the Soprano crime family. Blundetto shoots Joey and a prostitute he was seeing inside his car. Soprano later discovers that Blundetto committed the murder and confronts Blundetto, who claims innocence. Although Soprano knows the truth, he tells Johnny Sack that he does not know who the killer was. In \\"The Test Dream\\", Phil and Billy Leotardo kill Angelo in retribution for Peeps' death. This drives Blundetto into a rage, and he tracks down the Leotardo brothers, wounding Phil and killing Billy. By the end of season 5, Soprano is under heavy pressure to deliver his cousin to Johnny Sack (who has taken over his crime family after Little Carmine's abdication), explicitly so he can be tortured and killed by Phil Leotardo. After one of Soprano's associates is badly beaten by Phil, Soprano realizes that he is putting everyone in his crime family in jeopardy by protecting his cousin. Soprano is able to track down Blundetto at their uncle Pat Blundetto's farm. At point blank range, Soprano kills him with a 12-gauge shotgun in order to prevent his torture at the hands of Phil. Soprano then gives Johnny Sack Blundetto's location. Later, Phil arrives to find Blundetto already dead, and is furious to be deprived of his vengeance. Soprano then tells Christopher Moltisanti to bury his cousin Tony secretly, and in one piece, off the premises. Tony and Johnny reach an accord over Blundetto's demise, although Phil remains unsatisfied. Rosalie Aprile Rosalie \\"Ro\\" Aprile is played by Sharon Angela. Rosalie is the widow of Jackie Aprile Sr., who died of cancer, and the mother of Jackie Aprile Jr. and Kelli Aprile. She is good friends with mob wives Carmela Soprano and Gabriella Dante, to whom she offers characteristically frank advice. One year after Jackie Sr.'s death, she started a relationship with mobster Ralph Cifaretto. Ralph encouraged Jackie Jr. as he became more and more involved in the family business, providing him with a gun, accepting payments from him, involving him in making collections, and offering advice. Jackie Jr. tried to make a name for himself by robbing a card game, but the heist went awry. Tony and Ralph decided that Jackie Jr. had to be killed, unbeknownst to Rosalie. The hit was carried out by Vito Spatafore, but Rosalie and the rest of the family were told that Jackie was killed by black drug dealers. Following her son's death, Rosalie sank into a prolonged period of mourning. Ralph began an affair with Janice Soprano, and Ralph soon broke up with Rosalie, claiming he was tired of her constant grief. Rosalie, angered by his selfishness, ordered him out of her home. Rosalie accompanied Carmela on a trip to Paris in the season 6 episode \\"Cold Stones\\". While there, she pursued a brief relationship with a much younger Frenchman named Michel. Patsy Parisi Pasquale \\"Patsy\\" Parisi is played by Dan Grimaldi. Patsy is a soldier in Tony Soprano's crew, and is often seen calculating the group's finances in the Bada Bing or Satriale's offices. He and Burt Gervasi run the North Ward Emergency Merchants Protective Cooperative: an extortion racket hitting storeowners in Broadway, Newark, Forest Hill, Newark, New Jersey, Mount Pleasant, New Jersey, Roseville, Newark, Seventh Avenue, Newark and Woodside Township, New Jersey. Patsy had an identical twin brother, Phillip \\"Philly Spoons\\" Parisi (also played by Dan Grimaldi), who had a hit taken out on him by Tony, and was killed by Soprano soldier Gigi Cestone. He was born March 4, 1950, 11 minutes before his brother Phillip in Bloomfield, New Jersey. At the time, Philly was acting capo of Junior Soprano's crew and Patsy was a member. Patsy never had concrete evidence about his brother's murder, but it occurred soon after a brief and bloody war between Junior and Tony, and Philly was known to be talking about Tony's actions. It was this killing that prompted Tony to move Patsy to keep an eye on him. Patsy took the killing very hard, which brought on a problem with alcoholism. In 2000, a drunken Patsy was observed by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents outside the Soprano family home leveling a gun at Tony through his window. He reconsidered though, and only urinated in the Sopranos' pool. Patsy also openly vented his feelings of loss to the Soprano crew in front of the men responsible for his brother's death, Gigi and Tony, at a dinner in the back of Satriale's. He eventually put his grief behind him. Patsy still has questionable loyalties. When Patsy's then capo Paulie Gualtieri was imprisoned in 2002, Tony promoted Christopher Moltisanti to acting captain over Patsy. Patsy did not take this well, eventually getting into a fight with Christopher. When Paulie was released and promoted to underboss, Christopher was made capo permanently. In the penultimate episode \\"The Blue Comet\\", Patsy is nearly killed by two men sent to murder Silvio Dante. Patsy manages to hold them off, but Silvio is badly wounded and put into a coma, while Patsy runs into the woods fleeing for his life. Patsy later celebrates his son's engagement to Meadow Soprano with Tony and his family. Gabriella Dante Gabriella Dante is played by Maureen Van Zandt. Gabriella is married to longtime DiMeo crime family soldier and consigliere Silvio Dante. They have a daughter, Heather Dante, who played volleyball and soccer with Meadow Soprano. She is close friends with Rosalie Aprile and Carmela Soprano and can often be seen dining out with them, typically at \\"Nuovo Vesuvio\\". In 2006, when Tony was shot, Silvio became acting boss of the family. Gabriella was supportive of her husband in this role and ambitious enough to encourage him to consider the possibility of it long term. Angie Bonpensiero Angie Bonpensiero (née Belfiore) is played by Toni Kalem. Angie is married to Sal \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero whom she married in 1976. They have three children, Kevin, Matt, and Terri. Angie was unaware of her husband's status as an FBI informant. His disappearance when he was afraid Tony Soprano became suspicious, and subsequent erratic behavior, created problems for their relationship. When she and her husband were having marital problems, Angie considered both suicide and divorce. When her husband returned, she was being tested for breast cancer. At Carmela's urging to stay true to her Catholic faith, Angie decided to move into a separate bedroom rather than end their marriage. In 2001, after Tony Soprano confirmed his suspicions by finding tapes in Big Pussy's cigar box, he is killed. Tony continued to compensate Angie in her husband's absence–but she used the money to buy a new car, but still complained to Carmela about her strained finances, prompting Tony to cease her allowance. Later, Carmela runs into Angie working at a grocery store after having lost contact. Tony later made Angie the manager of Big Pussy's body shop. After a long period of time without talking, she and Carmela decide to end their quarrel and go out to dinner. Shortly after the reconciliation Carmela learns that Angie is putting money out on the street via Patsy Parisi and Benny Fazio for shylocking and they are using their connections to help her with the body shop. Benny Fazio Benito \\"Benny\\" Fazio Jr. is played by Max Casella. Benny is a soldier who began working for the DiMeo crime family with Christopher Moltisanti under capo Paulie Gualtieri, and continued to work for Chris after Chris's elevation to caporegime. Benny debuted in the third episode of season 3, with his release from jail and renewed association with Christopher. He has a no-show job as a United Association plumber. He began working for Christopher just after Christopher became a made man in 2001. Later, Jackie Aprile Jr. informed Fazio and Moltisanti of an opportunity to rob a Jewel concert at Rutgers University. Benny and Chris committed the robbery and made a clean escape with Jackie driving. In 2002, Benny was awarded one of the \\"no-work\\" United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America jobs at the esplanade construction site. He was assigned the task of killing two would-be assassins contracted by Tony to whack New York City boss Carmine Lupertazzi after the hit was called off. Benny and Petey LaRosa ambushed and killed the hitmen—two black heroin dealers, Credenzo Curtis and Stanley Johnson—who were set up by Christopher Moltisanti. In late 2004, Benny was seriously beaten by Lupertazzi capo Phil Leotardo. The crisis brought on by Tony Blundetto was reaching a breaking point and Phil severely beat Benny to send a message to Tony. Tony, feeling guilty about Benny's fractured skull, offered to give Benny his button when he recovered, meaning he would become a made man. Benny is married to Jen Fazio, who is pregnant. However, Benny began an affair with Martina, a new hostess at Nuovo Vesuvio, much to the irritation of owner and head chef Artie Bucco who had his eye on her. Benny was involved in Chris's credit card fraud scheme with Ahmed and Muhammad, using his relationship with Martina to get account numbers from Nuovo Vesuvio customers and selling them on through Soprano crew associate James \\"Murmur\\" Zancone. Benny gives Tony a tribute payment. American Express investigated Nuovo Vesuvio restaurant's role in the credit card fraud and pulled the restaurant's authority to accept American Express cards. Artie is able to figure out that Martina is the criminal in his staff through her relationship with Benny. Artie then angrily drives to Benny's home to confront him; the ensuing fight sent Benny to the hospital. Benny is set on killing Artie, but Tony intervenes, insisting Benny's parents have their anniversary dinner at Nuovo Vesuvio, and that the two make amends. Artie makes a table- side visit during their meal. In front of Benny's pregnant wife, Artie makes an innuendo to Benny's extramarital affair with Martina by asking Benny if he wants a \\"Martina,\\" explaining that it is an Albanian martini (Martina is Albanian) and adding \\"Well, apparently they go down real easy. Right, Ben?\\" Enraged, Benny follows Artie to the kitchen and holds his arm in a pot of boiling tomato sauce, burning him badly, and also rams his head into the counter. Benny later attended Chris's belated bachelor party, also at Nuovo Vesuvio and hosted by Artie, but the two refrained from initiating further violence. Benny helped guard Tony while he was in hiding from Phil Leotardo. Benny and several of Tony's other crew members were checking gas stations to find Phil Leotardo after being tipped off by Agent Harris that Phil was using a payphone at a gas station in the area. In the series finale, Benny is last seen acting as the getaway driver when Walden Belfiore shot Phil Leotardo to death at a gas station in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Little Paulie Germani Paul \\"Little Paulie\\" Germani is played by Carl Capotorto. Germani is thought to be the nephew (later revealed to actually be a first cousin once removed) and right-hand of Soprano family underboss Paulie Gualtieri. Germani is an associate and later soldier in the Moltisanti crew. Germani regularly hangs out with Christopher and accompanies him on debt collections visits. In season 4, Germani was tasked with vandalizing Carmine Lupertazzi's restaurant when Tony and Carmine got into a dispute over the HUD scam. He was also responsible for intimidating Alan Sapinsly after Tony's separation caused him to withdraw from a contract to buy property from Sapinsly. Paulie and Benny used Tony's home entertainment system speakers on his boat to blast Dean Martin recordings at the Sapinsly home at all hours. In season 5, Little Paulie holds a \\"no work\\" job at the Esplanade construction site and accompanied Chris when collecting a loan from writer J.T. Dolan. Also, early in Season 4, Germani precipitates the crisis between Tony and Johnny Sack, when he hears Ralph Cifaretto make a joke about the obesity of Johnny Sack's wife, and repeats this joke to Paulie Gualtieri, who relays the news of this to Johnny. In the season 6 episode \\"Walk like a Man\\", Little Paulie is badly hurt after being pushed out of a second story window by Christopher during a feud with Paulie. He suffers six broken vertebrae. He helps in the war with the Lupertazzi crime family, disguising himself as a police officer while searching for Phil Leotardo. Little Carmine Lupertazzi Carmine \\"Little Carmine\\" Lupertazzi Jr. is played by Ray Abruzzo. Little Carmine is a capo and the son of Carmine Lupertazzi, the leader of one of New York's Five Families. He followed in his father's footsteps and becoming a member of the Lupertazzi family at an early age. Little Carmine also has interests in several legitimate businesses including nightclubs in South Beach, Miami and a scaffolding contractor company in New York and New Jersey in addition to receiving proceeds from illicit activities. He moved with his wife and daughter to Florida in 2000, along with his criminal operations, and splits time between Miami Beach, Florida and New York. While Little Carmine is initially viewed as a pretentious, spoiled mobster whose constant malapropisms convey poor intellect, he later assumes an elder-statesmen role, frequently mediating disputes that arise in the Lupertazzi crime family. Little Carmine is introduced in season four when Tony Soprano visits him in Miami to seek his counsel in settling a dispute between Carmine Sr. and Johnny Sack. In the beginning of season five, Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. has a massive stroke and dies a few days later. Little Carmine immediately comes up to New York from Florida to see his father before he passes, and quickly becomes embroiled in a power struggle with Johnny Sack. Since Little Carmine is the son of the former boss, he has de facto claim to the throne, and this angers Johnny who was Carmine Sr.'s long time second in command. Even Tony has no faith in Little Carmine's capacity to run New York, jokingly referring to him as \\"Brainless the Second\\". Despite his shortcomings, Little Carmine finds backers in Carmine Sr.'s recently paroled former consigliere, Angelo Garepe, and long-time Lupertazzi Capo Rusty Millio. Angelo and Rusty, along with Rusty's right-hand man Eddie Pietro, pull most of the strings during the war between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine. However, after a cycle of bloodshed that escalates into war, Little Carmine ultimately finds it difficult to stomach the continuing violence and abdicates. His decision was heavily influenced by the murder of Angelo Garepe. After Little Carmine's capitulation, Johnny Sack becomes the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family. After this, Little Carmine keeps a low profile and is no longer seen as a threat. Johnny Sack was arrested soon after by the FBI who were acting on information given to them by Johnny's trusted ally and long- time Lupertazzi Captain Jimmy Petrille. With Johnny in federal custody during his federal racketeering trial, Phil Leotardo became the acting boss in New York. By season six, Little Carmine is brought in as an investor on a movie project, Cleaver, that Christopher Moltisanti had been working on. Little Carmine is instrumental in organizing a meeting with Sir Ben Kingsley in Los Angeles to court his interest in the project, but Kingsley eventually passes on the lead role. Little Carmine had helped Kingsley's booking agent out of some trouble he had down in the Florida Keys. Nevertheless, Little Carmine continues to get involved in crime family affairs. He tries to help resolve a longstanding feud between the Lupertazzi crime family and the Soprano crime family. After Leotardo becomes boss, tensions escalate between the two crime families and Little Carmine makes a last effort to resolve it. Phil is less generous in business dealings with the New Jersey family and still harbors anger over Tony's cousin killing Phil's brother in front of him. When the conflict eventually escalates into a war between the two families, Little Carmine and Tony both turn to a neutral party, George Paglieri, to broker a negotiation between Tony and Butch DeConcini, the street boss for Leotardo while he is in hiding. At a sitdown with Little Carmine, Butch, Albie Cianflone, Tony and Paulie Gualtieri, everyone agrees that the war has gone too far and that Phil's decisions have led to negative consequences on both sides. Butch agrees to back off while the Soprano family hunts down Phil. Carlo Gervasi Carlo Gervasi is played by Arthur J. Nascarella. Carlo was a capo in the DiMeo crime family. Carlo was promoted to caporegime of James \\"Little Jimmy\\" Altieri's crew after Jimmy was murdered on suspicion of being an FBI informant. He was in charge of obtaining grey-market goods from container ships docking at the Newark ports. He is introduced in season 4. In season 6, Carlo begins to emerge from the background and become a more prominent character. Carlo took over Vito Spatafore's construction business in addition to the ports, after the revelation of Vito's homosexuality and his subsequent downfall. When Tony decided that Spatafore had to be killed to appease acting New York City boss Phil Leotardo, and Silvio Dante asked if the hit should be assigned to anyone in particular, Soprano suggested Carlo for the job. However, Spatafore was beaten to death by Phil Leotardo's men Gerry Torciano and Dominic \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamiello before Carlo could act. Carlo later avenged his family's honor by stabbing Fat Dom four times with a large chef's knife for making jokes about Spatafore's murder and implying that Carlo was also homosexual. The killing occurred in the back room of Satriale's pork store and Silvio also took part; Tony Soprano later discovered them waiting to dispose of the body and was angry because of the murder's possible repercussions. Carlo took charge of disposing of Gamiello's body and drove to Connecticut to deposit his head in a storm drain, phoning Silvio to confirm that the last part was safely away and to ask about Tony's plans to blow up Phil's wire room. Carlo's son Jason attends Rutgers University, where he is involved in gambling and loansharking. Carlo's cousin, Burt switched sides during the Lupertazzi/Soprano war and was killed for his disloyalty by Silvio Dante. In the series finale, Carlo's son was said to be arrested by the FBI for drug dealing. Gervasi failed to show up for a meeting with Paulie Gualtieri, which worried Tony that he may have been cutting a deal with the police. Tony's attorney confirmed that someone was in fact going to testify before a grand jury and that indictments were forthcoming. In the final scene, Tony told Carmela that Carlo was testifying, confirming that he had turned informant, likely in a deal to keep his son out of jail. Phil Leotardo Phil Leotardo is played by actor Frank Vincent. Phil is a high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi crime family and the primary antagonist of the final two seasons of the show. Originally a captain, following the death of the original boss, Carmine Lupertazzi, the imprisonment and death of his successor Johnny Sacrimoni, and a brief power struggle with would-be boss Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro, Phil becomes the boss of the family. His inability to forgive the death of his brother at the hands of Tony's cousin, Tony Blundetto—even after Blundetto's own murder—forms one of the central conflicts of the series, with Leotardo aiming to kill Tony and cripple his entire organization in revenge. Leotardo had an alleged 27 hits to his credit. He quickly rejoined the Lupertazzi crime family, of Brooklyn, New York, once he was released from prison. Phil was married to Patty Leotardo and was a second cousin of Marie Spatafore. Phil bears a resemblance to the last Shah of Iran, leading to Tony Soprano and the DiMeo crime family often referring to him as \\"The Shah\\". It is revealed in season six that when Leotardo's grandfather immigrated from Sicily, officials changed their last name at Ellis Island from Leonardo to Leotardo and allegedly is a descendant of Leonardo da Vinci. Following Carmine Sr.'s death, a power struggle between two factions ensued. One side was led by Carmine's underboss, Johnny Sack, while the other was ostensibly led by Carmine's only son and Miami capo Little Carmine Lupertazzi. Phil became Johnny's right-hand man during the war, and carried out murders in order to weaken Little Carmine's resolve. Phil performed a mock execution of Lorraine Calluzzo, while she was tightly taped and gagged, shooting at her while holding a phone book in the path of the bullet, to persuade her to redirect her payments from Little Carmine to Johnny Sack. When she failed to comply Phil returned with his younger brother, Billy Leotardo, and Joey Peeps, who killed Lorraine. When Peeps was later killed by Tony's cousin Tony Blundetto, Phil and Billy murdered Angelo Garepe in response. Phil became personally involved in the war when his brother Billy was murdered by Blundetto as revenge for the hit the Leotardo brothers carried out on Angelo, who was Blundetto's close friend. Little Carmine ultimately found it difficult to stomach the continuing violence and abdicates. After Little Carmine's capitulation, Johnny Sack becomes the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family. After this, Litte Carmine keeps a low profile and is no longer seen as a threat. Johnny Sack was arrested soon after by the FBI who were acting on information given to them by Johnny's trusted ally and Carmine's long-time consigliere Jimmy Petrille. With Johnny in federal custody during his federal racketeering trial, Phil Leotardo became the acting boss in New York. Soprano initially protected Blundetto against Phil. Phil stalked New Jersey looking for Blundetto hounding Christopher Moltisanti's mother Joanne, home and badly beating Soprano associate Benny Fazio. When it became clear that Tony's men would not allow themselves to be imperiled for no good reason, Tony was forced to act. Tony ultimately murdered his own cousin to save his family and give Blundetto a quick and painless death after Johnny Sack had made it clear that Phil would torture Blundetto if he found him. Phil was angered that his opportunity for vengeance was stolen, however, at a meeting between the two bosses, Johnny and Tony made peace, but the moment was interrupted by Johnny's arrest by the FBI, while Tony escaped. With Johnny in federal custody, Phil became acting boss of the Lupertazzi family. Phil worked closely with Tony and Vito Spatafore, the husband of his cousin, on the two family's joint construction efforts. When Vito's homosexuality was publicly revealed in season six, Phil visited Marie to try to find out if she knew where Vito was (he had gone into hiding in New Hampshire). When she pleaded for mercy for her husband, he told her they just wanted to get Vito help. Phil also harassed Tony about his efforts to find Vito. Vito later returned to New Jersey after he could not adjust to life outside of the mob, and met Tony to offer to buy his way back into the family. Tony refused, but did not attempt to harm Vito. Tony had arranged for Carlo Gervasi to execute Vito at the mall early in the morning on the pretense that Vito was supposedly meeting up with Tony, to straighten out the situation, however when Vito returned to his motel, Phil's soldiers Gerry Torciano and Dominic \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamielleo ambushed as he walked through the door. Phil emerged from the closet, slowly walked up to Vito who was being held by Gerry and Fat Dom and sits down on the bed. He looks Vito in the eye and says, \\"You're a fucking disgrace.\\" And with that, Fat Dom and Gerry Torciano proceed to beat Vito to death. Subsequently, with having made his cousin Marie a widow, Phil balks when Tony tries to reach out to him for restitution for Marie and refuses. Phil tells Marie that her husband was probably killed by two homosexual transients Vito had picked up at a bar. Fat Dom was murdered by an enraged Carlo Gervasi during a visit to Satriale's after making repeated wisecracks, in the wake of Vito's death, about the sexual orientation of New Jersey mobsters. Leotardo, while on a date with his Ukrainian housemaid, he approached one of his Brooklyn businesses, only to be blown off of his feet by a bomb planted in the building. After an unsuccessful attempt by Little Carmine Lupertazzi to broker peace between the families, Leotardo and his crew plotted revenge. Although Phil balked at the idea of killing Tony himself, captain Butch DeConcini seemingly persuaded him to target someone important to the DiMeo family. However, their planning was cut short when Phil suffered a late-night heart attack and was hospitalized during Christmas 2006. Once he recovered, Phil decided to step down as boss to make way for his protégé Gerry Torciano in charge. Yet Phil did not strongly back Torciano as successor, and Lupertazzi underboss Doc Santoro soon made his own bid for power by having Torciano murdered. After deciding to get back in the game, Phil waited, working under Doc Santoro until the old man's arrogance got too much to handle. As Phil sat down to dinner with Doc to acknowledge him as boss, Doc humiliated Phil by literally taking food from his plate. Knowing that he had broad support, including Tony's, Phil ordered a hit on Santoro. Driven by Butch DeConcini, Phil's crew murdered Santoro and an associate outside a massage parlor, leaving him dead on the sidewalk. After the assassination, Phil was permanently elevated to boss of the Lupertazzi family, with Cianflone cemented as consigliere and DeConcini as underboss. After Tony viciously beats one of Phil's men, Coco, for threatening his daughter Meadow, Phil refuses to meet with Tony and then launches a war against the DiMeo family, ordering that New York is to \\"decapitate\\" New Jersey and do business with what's left, instructing that hits be made on Tony, Bobby Baccalieri, and Silvio Dante. Bobby is killed and Silvio is wounded badly and left in a coma. Tony goes into hiding with the remainder of the family. In the Sopranos series finale, \\"Made in America\\", Butch DeConcini and Albie Cianflone arrange a sit down with Tony and Paulie, where they express their dissatisfaction with Phil's leadership and agree to a ceasefire of the war. Butchie says he will not reveal the location of Phil, but then says \\"You do what you got to do\\"—this following a recent phone conversation with Butchie and Phil, where Phil implies a threat to Butchie over his inability to find Tony Soprano. Shortly thereafter, the location of Leotardo is made known to Tony by information from Agent Harris in exchange for terrorism information on Ahmed and Muhammad. Hiding in Oyster Bay, Long Island, Leotardo is shown talking to his wife through a car window at a gas station when he is suddenly shot in the head by Walden Belfiore, a soldier in the Gervasi crew of the DiMeo family. Leaving their grandchildren in her Ford Expedition, Leotardo's wife rushes to Phil's side in a panic. Unattended and still in drive with the engine running, the car idles forward and a tire rolls over and crushes Phil's skull. Leotardo's murder was the 92nd and final murder in the series. ==Recurring characters== The following is a list of characters that are, or at one time were, a recurring guest on the series; they are listed in the order that they first appeared on the show.

In June 2020, casting directors Georgianne Walken and Sheila Jaffe said that Jerry Stiller had been originally set to play Hesh, but due to scheduling issues, Adler was cast quickly. Hesh is an advisor and friend to Tony Soprano. Hesh is a Jewish loan shark and an advisor to Tony (the same role he performed for Tony's father, mob captain Johnny Soprano). Hesh is a shrewd businessman, having made his fortune in the recording industry by founding \\"F-Note Records\\" during the 1950s and 1960s by bringing many young black musicians to prominence, getting royalties by having his name added as a co-writer on many songs. He first appeared in \\"The Sopranos\\" (\\"Pilot\\"). Hesh may be a composite character inspired by music mogul Morris \\"Mo\\" Levy, founder of Roulette Records, who had connections to the Mafia and owned a string of racehorses. Hesh first appeared working with Tony on setting up a scam to defraud HMO medical insurance companies through their debtor Alex Mahaffey. Hesh accompanied Big Pussy to a waterfall to intimidate Mahaffey into participating. Later, Hesh advised Tony against getting involved with the Teitlemanns, a family of Hasidic Jews, in a dispute over ownership of their hotel. Hesh's predictions of their obstinacy proved correct. Hesh was able to help Tony end a particularly arduous \\"negotiation\\" with a castration. In \\"A Hit Is a Hit\\" Hesh helped Tony's nephew Christopher Moltisanti to realize that his girlfriend Adriana La Cerva had little aptitude for work in the music business. Chris also made contact with Hesh on behalf of Massive Genius—a rapper who claimed Hesh owed compensation to the widow of a black musician he allegedly defrauded. Hesh also sold Ralph Cifaretto the ill-fated racehorse Pie-O-My. In the season six premiere \\"Members Only\\" Hesh and his son-in-law Eli were attacked by members of Phil Leotardo's crew – they had targeted Eli because they thought he was making collections on their turf without permission. The mobsters set fire to Eli's gas tank to get him and Hesh out of the car and then set about beating Eli. Eli was seriously hurt when he was the victim of a hit-and-run trying to escape the mobsters. Hesh was punched in the face. In the final season Hesh gives Tony a $200,000 bridge loan to help Tony cover a string of gambling losses. Tony fails to repay the loan on time and starts berating Hesh about the vig on the loan which was $3,000 a week, leading to bad blood on both sides. When Hesh's girlfriend, Renata, dies of a stroke, Tony repays the loan out of loyalty. Alex Mahaffey Alex Mahaffey is played by Michael Gaston. He is a \\"degenerate gambler\\" is in debt to Tony and Hesh Rabkin, an old Jewish friend of Tony's father, Johnny. Tony concocts a scheme for Mahaffey's company to make insurance claims payable to non-existent clinics in order to pay off his debts, and he is intimidated into complying. Giacomo \\"Jackie\\" Aprile Sr. Giacomo \\"Jackie\\" Aprile Sr. is played by Michael Rispoli. He was born in 1955, and rose through the ranks of the DiMeo Crime Family with his older brother Richie and close friend Tony Soprano. Jackie was also the brother of Liz La Cerva, and thus the uncle of Adriana La Cerva. Jackie and Tony, along with Silvio Dante and Ralph Cifaretto, belonged to a small crew moving weed and stolen goods. Around this time, Jackie had the idea to rob a card game held by capo Michele \\"Feech\\" La Manna in order to make a name for themselves. Jackie's star rose considerably in the intervening years, during which he started a family. He married Rosalie Aprile, and they had three children together. Jackie never wanted his son Jackie Aprile Jr. to get involved in the mob despite his success. He and Richie appointed Aprile crew associate Peter \\"Beansie\\" Gaeta to peddle heroin for them, taking the largest cut for themselves. Aprile was the acting boss of the family from 1995, when boss Ercole DiMeo went to prison, until 1999, when he dies of stomach cancer in the fourth episode of season one, and is succeeded by Junior. Michael \\"Mikey Grab Bag\\" Palmice Michael \\"Mikey Grab Bag\\" Palmice is played by Al Sapienza. Mikey starts out as a soldier in Corrado \\"Junior\\" Soprano's crew as his driver and bodyguard. After Jackie Aprile Sr. dies, Junior becomes boss. He is a very loyal, obsequious minion to Junior. In Tony's brief and bloody war with Junior's crew, following Junior's attempt on Tony's life, Paulie Gualtieri is assigned the hit on Mikey, with Christopher Moltisanti. Chris' friend Brendan Filone had previously been killed by Mikey while in his bathtub on orders of Junior in retribution for Brendan's stealing of his merchandise. Tony decides to confront his uncle and Mikey by beating Mikey to the ground and stapling his jacket to his torso. He then goes to have a sit-down with Junior for his orders. Later, in retaliation for the attempted hit on Tony, Mikey is killed in the woods after Chris and Paulie chase him down while he is jogging. In the episode \\"From Where to Eternity,\\" while Chris is in the hospital recovering from the bullet wounds caused by Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte's failed assassination attempt, when Chris becomes clinically dead for a few minutes after his heart stops while in his comatose state, he has a morphine-induced dream in which he visits Hell and sees his deceased father \\"Dickie\\" Moltisanti along with his deceased friend Brendan Filone and Mikey, who had slain Brendan. Chris informs Tony and Paulie that Mikey had a message for them: \\"Three o'clock\\". Paulie subsequently begins to have nightmares of being dragged to Hell. Paulie, at the recommendation of his mistress, goes to see a medium in Nyack, New York. Much to Paulie's chagrin, the authenticity of the medium seems to be confirmed when he apparently begins communicating with people that Paulie has killed, with Mikey apparently giving details of his murder. Paulie remains unsettled and paranoid, as he also feels he is being haunted by Palmice accompanied by others he had murdered throughout his criminal life. Agent Dwight Harris Agent Dwight Harris is played by Matt Servitto. Harris is an FBI Supervisor Agent-in-Charge specializing in investigation of the DiMeo crime family with the FBI's Newark Organized Crime Division Task Force. After September 11, Harris is reassigned to counter-terrorism duty with the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Pakistan. He also approaches Christopher, and eventually Tony, for information on terrorism-related organized crime from his criminal connections at the Port of New York and New Jersey in exchange for banking \\"goodwill\\" in possible future RICO trials. In the Season 6 episode \\"Kaisha\\", Harris appears at Satriale's Pork Store to inform Tony that someone in his crew could be in danger, although he has no specific details. While investigating the murder of Gilbert Nieves at the Crazy Horse and Matush, with the possible terrorism links, he takes over the investigation from Long Branch, New Jersey police. Later, Agent Harris and his partner, Agent Goddard, approach Tony at his home, requesting that Tony inform them should he come across any terror-related information in his line of work. Later, he suspects that two Muslim former patrons of the Bada Bing (Ahmed and Muhammad), who had been paying Christopher Moltisanti for stolen credit card numbers, were involved in terrorist activity. Tony provides their names and a cell phone number to Agent Harris, who is appreciative. In return, Agent Harris promises to write a letter detailing Tony's assistance that will be placed in Tony's FBI file for a judge to consider in sentencing should Tony ever be convicted of a crime. Harris later tells Tony at Satriale's that an informer among Phil Leotardo's crew told them that Tony is being targeted by the Lupertazzi family. Agent Harris meets with Tony, and Tony offers him the name of the Muslim men's bank. In return, Harris tells Tony that while in hiding, Leotardo has been making calls from a pay phone in Oyster Bay, Long Island, information he apparently obtains from an agent in the Brooklyn FBI Organized Crime Division Office. When Agent Goddard later reports Leotardo's murder, Harris exults in the success of his ploy, stating \\"we're gonna win this thing!\\" Father Phil Intintola Father Phil Intintola is played by Paul Schulze, Michael Santoro (pilot episode only). Father Phil is the priest at the Soprano's local Catholic church. Initially, Father Phil and Carmela Soprano have a robust friendship based on a mutual interest in romance films and Italian culture. Carmela's husband, Tony, finds their friendship—and Father Phil's constant, uninvited visits to their home for Carmela's home-cooked food— irritating. Carmela describes Father Phil as a \\"spiritual mentor\\" she utilizes \\"to become a better Catholic\\", and, the rare male friend who appreciates things that the ultra-masculine Tony finds to be unmanly. One rainy evening, with Tony and Meadow in Maine and AJ at a friend's house, Father Phil visits a sick Carmela, and the two share ziti and wine together. After much wine and watching a film together, the two come very close to kissing. He sleeps over without having sex with Carmela, resulting in an awkward feeling between the two the morning after. Carmela gets jealous when she makes a surprise visit to the church to bring Father Phil home-cooked food—only to see him already being fed a home-cooked dish by her friend, Rosalie Aprile, and him having the same chemistry with her that she thought he only had with her. Soon after, Carmela confronts Father Phil and ends her friendship with him, accusing him of developing para-romantic relationships with women parishioners to gain gifts and other favors. Although Father Phil was mostly seen ministering to female parishioners, he also counseled men. He repeatedly invited Tony to attend church and confession more often in order to reduce his anxiety attacks by improving his relationship with God. He also counselled Artie Bucco when he was told about Tony burning down his restaurant by Livia. Father Phil encouraged Artie to go to the police and to tell Charmaine about the arson, which Artie ultimately did not. He also counseled Ralph Cifaretto when he came to him devastated and perplexed by his teen son's life-threatening injury after an accident whilst playing bow and arrows with a friend. Father Phil encourages Ralph to view the tragedy as an opportunity to change his life's course; he also gently rejects Ralph's assertion that God allowed his son to be injured in order to punish Ralph for his criminal sins. Later in the series, Carmela confesses an act of adultery to Father Phil, who is disappointed. He orders Carmela to do a penance by way of doing something nice for Tony, which she later does. In season 6, when Tony is comatose after being shot, Carmela was again dependent on Father Phil, who comforts her and the Soprano children at Tony's hospital bedside. Vin Makazian Vin Makazian is played by John Heard. Vin was a Newark, New Jersey police detective who worked on narcotics and vice squads who fed information to Tony Soprano. He was raised by an abusive alcoholic father who beat him as a child and his mother. His salary was $40,000 per year and had two failed marriages. Tony also used Vin as a personal private investigator, engaging Vin to find information about his psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi when Tony first started therapy in 1999. One night, he tailed her and pulled her car over under the ruse that the vehicle was seen leaving a crime scene earlier in the day. He then questioned Jennifer's date, a lawyer, under the suspicion that he was driving drunk, beats him unprovoked. Vin was responsible for informing Tony that Sal \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero was an FBI informant, prompting Tony's suspicions of Pussy, though this was later seemingly dismissed when Tony found out Vin owed Big Pussy $30,000 in Super Bowl XXXIII gambling debts with interest payments, and Vin would like to see Big Pussy taken out to absolve him of that debt. The best man at one of his weddings sits on the New Jersey State Police Organized Crime Task Force and gave Vin the initial hint that Big Pussy was an informant. Vin frequented an illegal brothel and had a relationship with the madam there. He was arrested at the brothel along with Soprano crime family capo Raymond Curto during a police raid. Vin later committed suicide, by leaping off the Donald and Morris Goodkind Bridges into the Raritan River shortly after he was released from jail and suspended from the police force. Tony later visited the madam Debra with whom Vin had a therapeutic relationship, and she divulges to Tony that Vin viewed him as a friend, and was prone to depression. This leaves Tony with guilt because he had always treated Vin with disdain and never showed him any respect or kindness. Dick Barone Dick Barone is played by Joe Lisi. Dick owned and operated Barone Sanitation, a container and rubbish removal service, and front business for the Soprano crew. The company handled their legitimate garbage hauling routes across New Jersey, including an illegal medical waste dumping site in Dayton, New Jersey and an asbestos removal project in Corning, New York, a weigh station in Dayton, New Jersey and a landfill in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. Dick is involved in price-fixing and bid rigging of waste hauling contracts in New Jersey and New York. In a discussion with Richie Aprile and Tony, Tony says that all the garbage collection routes north of Paterson, New Jersey belong to Barone Sanitation while Larry Boy Barese and the D'Allessio brothers divide up the rest. Dick's son Jason works as a ski instructor at Deer Valley in Summit County, Utah and knew little about the waste management business. In 1999, the lucrative new office parkway, the Triborough Towers in Essex County, New Jersey along the Eisenhower Parkway in Roseland, New Jersey and Livingston, New Jersey route was subject to a bidding war between Barone and Czechoslovakian-based waste management company, Kolar Brothers Sanitation. Dick Barone was part of the crews' discussions about the problem and was at Satriale's when Christopher Moltisanti took it upon himself to deal with the issue and murder Emil Kolar. Chris' action led to the Kolar Bros. withdrawing their bid which Dick was happy to report to Tony. He worried about Richie Aprile due to Aprile's and Junior Soprano's front business, Zanone Bros carting cocaine on his garbage association routes because he could lose his \\"901\\" saying that he can handle the Department of Sanitation due to having a contact inside the Environmental Protection Agency, but not the Drug Enforcement Administration. Dick died in 2006 from Lou Gehrig's disease. His funeral was attended by many members of the DiMeo crime family. Dick was survived by his wife, Helen Barone, and son, Jason. Following his death, Barone Sanitation was bought out by Lupertazzi crime family firm, Cinelli Sanitation. Tony asked John Sacramoni for 25% of the sale price and a year's salary until retirement plus skim from the company that is $2,000 a week when the company went up for sale. He agreed to lower the sale settlement by staying on the payroll and lowering the skim profits. James \\"Jimmy\\" Altieri James \\"Jimmy\\" Altieri is played by Joe Badalucco. Jimmy was a capo in the DiMeo/Soprano crime family. In the episode \\"Nobody Knows Anything\\", Jimmy was arrested for gun charges while running an illegal card game. The FBI found pool tables full of guns. Big Pussy Bonpensiero was also present and arrested but was already working for the feds at this point (Agent Skip Lipari stated he had been with them since 1998, although Tony thinks Pussy \\"flipped\\" in 1995). Vin Makazian, Tony's inside detective (who works clandestinely for Tony), informs Tony that Big Pussy Bonpensiero is \\"wired for sound\\" (that is, he is an informant). Tony finds this very difficult to believe. Shortly after Jimmy's arrest, he is released. He shows up one night at Tony's home during dinner. He and Tony walk into the basement where Jimmy begins asking Tony a lot of questions, making Tony very suspicious. Tony finds Jimmy's behavior very peculiar and also believes he was released too promptly after his arrest. Tony then begins to suspect that Makazian mistook Jimmy for Pussy as they are similar in appearance. Pussy abruptly disappears after being confronted by Paulie Gualtieri. Earlier in the episode, Vin Makazian, who had chronic depression, had committed suicide by jumping off a bridge, so Tony was not able to confirm whether Vin had confused Jimmy and Pussy. Tony decides to go with his instincts and decides that Jimmy is an informant. At a meeting with other administrators and capos, it is apparent to everyone else Jimmy is acting somewhat odd. As such, Uncle Junior sanctioned a hit on Jimmy and said he wanted a message to be sent. Christopher lured Jimmy to a hotel room using a stripper as bait. Once Jimmy was seated in the room, Silvio entered and put a gun to the back of his head. Jimmy realized what was about to happen and went for a gun in his ankle holster, at which point Silvio shot him in the back of his head. Jimmy's body was found in an alley with a rat stuffed in his mouth. Carlo Gervasi subsequently takes over Jimmy's abandoned crew after Jimmy's death. Irina Peltsin Irina Peltsin is played by Oksana Lada and Siberia Federico (pilot episode only). Irina is Tony's 24-year-old Russian mistress during the first two seasons. Tony broke up with Irina in season 2 because she wanted him to commit to a relationship. Irina then attempted suicide but was found by her cousin, Svetlana. As a sign of friendship and apologies, Tony sent Silvio to tell Irina to move on with her life and present her with a one-time payoff of $75,000. In Season 4, when Assemblyman Ronald Zellman tells Tony that he has been dating Irina for quite some time, and Tony does not seem to care. However, Tony later gets jealous and humiliates Zellman in front of Irina by whipping him with a belt. Svetlana later tells Tony the couple had broken up because, after the emasculating attack, Zellman \\"could not perform.\\" When Uncle Junior's nurse Branca, who works for Svetlana, walks in on Tony and Svetlana just after they had sex, she later tells Irina. Irina calls Tony's house, and then tells Carmela that she is Tony's ex-mistress and informs Carmela of Tony's tryst with Svetlana. Carmela warns Irina never to call the house again, but the call prompts Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their marital separation. Frank Cubitoso Frank Cubitoso is played by Frank Pellegrino. He is a FBI chief of Newark FBI Organized Crime Division Task Force with offices in 11 Center Place Newark, New Jersey who is constantly looking for new insight on the ongoing Soprano/DiMeo case. It was his idea to bug Green Grove Retirement Community when Tony Soprano, Jimmy Altieri and Larry Boy Barese move in their mothers, despite other agents' skepticism. He successfully coordinates a mission to put the Soprano residence under surveillance by the use of an old lamp in their basement. The operation ends when Meadow takes the old lamp to college. He later pressures Adriana La Cerva into wearing a wire, which leads to her confession and eventual death. When Agent Sanseverino worries after Adriana disappears, Cubitoso decides it is time to move on. Elliot Kupferberg Elliot Kupferberg is played by Peter Bogdanovich. Elliot is the therapist of Jennifer Melfi, who is the psychiatrist of Tony Soprano. Elliot tries to convince her numerous times to refer Tony to another colleague. Elliot calls her \\"Jen\\" during their sessions. Vin Makazian, Tony's inside cop, reveals to Tony when he is asked to surveille Jennifer that she sees her own psychiatrist, Kupferberg, which surprises Tony. Elliot has a daughter, Saskia. Saskia, a butch lesbian, was an upperclassman at Columbia University when Tony's daughter, Meadow Soprano was a freshman, and gave a presentation that led Meadow to join the South Bronx legal clinic that eventually put Meadow on the path to law school. Elliot once unknowingly encountered Tony in the parking garage at Columbia University, while both were visiting their daughters. He followed Tony in his car in the hopes of taking Tony's parking space when he left but annoyed Tony by driving too closely. In the episode \\"Employee of the Month,\\" Elliot urges her to cease treating her gangster patient, whose name she inadvertently reveals to Elliot. In 2007, following Tony's shooting by Junior and the rise of his media profile, Melfi accuses Elliot of directing their therapy towards discussing \\"Patient Soprano\\" because of his desire for gossip and continuous shows of interest in the Mafia. In the episode \\"The Second Coming,\\" he tells Melfi of a study that concludes that talk therapy enables sociopaths. In the episode \\"The Blue Comet,\\" he further presses Melfi about Soprano at a dinner party, where he reveals to guests that Soprano is Melfi's patient, to her embarrassment, a serious breach of doctor-patient confidentiality, although he dismisses her protests casually, saying everyone at the table is a professional. However, she later reads the study at home and is convinced of its findings. At her next session with Tony, she permanently ends further sessions. Elliot frequently drinks from a very large reusable water bottle during therapy sessions, which Bogdanovich claims was his own bottle at the time. Hugh DeAngelis Hugo \\"Hugh\\" DeAngelis is played by Tom Aldredge. Hugh is Carmela's father who is in his mid-70s. Hugh has been married to Mary for over 40 years and is a resident of West Orange, New Jersey. He is a former sailor of the United States Navy and spent time in Halifax, Nova Scotia at CFB Halifax during the war. Although he is semi-retired, Hugh had worked as a contractor, and he built Tony and Carmela's house. Hugh has a brother named Lester and a sister named Lena, who is actually the mother of Christopher Moltisanti's father Dickie, thus making Hugh Chris' great uncle. During Carmela and Tony's separation, Hugh was eager to see Tony whenever possible and often took Tony's side in family discussions. He did not want to be present at a family gathering if \\"the man of the house\\" was not there, in the episode \\"Marco Polo\\". Hugh became involved in a real estate investment with Carmela involving a spec house. However, construction of the spec house was halted after a building inspector found that low-quality wood had been used. Carmela blamed her father for the setback and Hugh became angry that Carmela was treating him as a subordinate rather than a partner. Carmela and Hugh reconciled enough for him to attend Christmas celebrations at the Soprano home later that year – after Carmela's spec house started to go ahead again. Mary DeAngelis Mary DeAngelis (née Pellegrino) is played by Suzanne Shepherd. Mary is Carmela's mother who is in her mid-70s. Mary has been married to her husband Hugh DeAngelis for over 40 years. Shortly after Carmela began dating Tony Soprano, she became extremely protective of her daughter and tried to prevent her from marrying him. After Carmela got married, the De Angelises met Tony's mother, Livia Soprano, with whom they became very angry after Livia told Carmela that \\"Tony would get bored of her.\\" Mary also has psoriasis. Agent Skip Lipari Agent Skip Lipari is played by Louis Lombardi. Skip is an FBI agent who handled Salvatore \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero. When Sal begins to confide more and more to Skip as a friend, Skip tries to tell him that he is not his friend and he is there to help the federal government. Pussy tells Skip that he lost all respect in Tony when Tony sent him out to look for AJ's science teacher Mr. Miller's Saturn that had been stolen. During a meeting at a party store, Sal coincidentally is seen by mob associate Jimmy Bones and introduces Skip as \\"Joe from Dover, Delaware\\" without much success in holding up the story. This later leads to Sal murdering Jimmy to cover up his connection with the FBI. Sal tries to trap Christopher in a RICO predicate with Tony by offering to get his girlfriend a BMW M3 convertible and give the information to the FBI. Sal fails to follow Moltisanti to a hijacking job when he hits a bicyclist. In the season 2 finale, Sal is murdered by Tony, Paulie and Silvio after they discover he is an informant. Matthew Bevilacqua Matthew Bevilacqua is played by Lillo Brancato Jr. Matthew was Sean Gismonte's partner-in-crime from West Orange, New Jersey and an associate working under Christopher Moltisanti in the Gualtieri crew. Born in 1977, he was 23 years old when he was killed, in \\"Bust Out.\\" In \\"Mr. Ruggiero's Neighborhood\\", Bonpensiero is overheard on an FBI wiretap that Bevilaqua's family is involved in the construction business and that the family saw him as a scion. Matthew also mentions that he and Sean attended the Lubin School of Business at Pace University and are licensed stock brokers. He bought marijuana from a drug dealer at The Bada Bing. Matt worked with Christopher in various aspects of organized crime, including the Massarone construction site; a pump and dump stockbroking scheme at an over- the-counter brokerage house in Bayonne, New Jersey involving an internet company called Webistics; assisting with Junior Soprano's executive card game; and some burglary jobs with Chris and Sean. When Chris leaves work early to go to the Jersey Shore with Adrianna, he leaves Matt in charge of the brokerage. They stole a Porsche Carrera from the office building that they were running the pump and dump stock scam from and beat up a stockbroker for suggesting a different stock. Matt threatened to stab the office manager of the brokerage in the throat with a letter opener if he told Chris Moltisanti about their actions. The office manager reported them anyway. Silvio referred to Matt and Sean as, \\"Chip n' Dale\\" after the cartoon because of their ineptness. Matt tells Christopher that he sees no point in getting married because he can get all the women he wants and always hire someone to wash his dishes and iron his shirts. He drives a Buick Regal that he abandons after Sean is shot and killed in the passenger seat during the failed mob hit on Christopher Moltisanti. Despite their general lack of talent, the duo desperately wanted to move up in the ranks of the family. They tried to impress Tony whenever possible, but eventually angered him by attempting to directly discuss criminal activity with him at the toilets in a men's room, unaware of the threat of wiretapping. Then, hoping to gain favor with Richie Aprile, Matt and Sean decided to make an assassination attempt on Christopher, who they knew Aprile disliked. Attempting a drive-by ambush in the parking lot outside the stock brokerage firm, they hit Christopher twice but were unable to kill him. Before collapsing from blood loss, Christopher was able to return fire, killing Sean while Matthew fled to seek protection from Richie Aprile, who reacted angrily and chased him away. When Tony Soprano and Big Pussy Bonpensiero found him hiding in Hacklebarney State Park, they interrogated him before they emptied their guns into him in one of the park's concession stands. Before he is killed, Bevilacqua pleas to Tony that it was all Sean's idea to shoot Moltisanti. There was an witness in the park that connected the murder to Tony, although the witness retracted his statement upon learning that one of the shooters may have been Tony Soprano. The newspaper identified Matthew as a Soprano crime family \\"associate.\\" Jackie Aprile Jr. Giacomo Michael \\"Jackie\\" Aprile Jr. is played by Jason Cerbone (as Matthew Cerbone at young age). Jackie Jr. was born 1978 into a North Jersey mafia family and raised in Lincoln Park, New Jersey. His father, Jackie Aprile Sr., was once the acting boss of the DiMeo crime family, and his uncle Richie Aprile was a long time capo in the same crime family. Despite attempts to succeed at Rutgers University, Jackie Jr. drifted towards a life of crime after his father's death, and began helping his uncle Richie in his crew when Richie was released from prison. His mother Rosalie Aprile began a romantic relationship with Ralph Cifaretto. Ralph was more of a mentor in Jackie's attempt to follow in his father's footsteps. It was Ralph's bad influence, Jackie Jr.'s own faults, and finally Tony's insistence that Jackie Jr. not become involved in organized crime, that were the contributing factors that propelled Jackie Jr. into a brief, humiliating and fatal career as a criminal. Working alongside his friend and Rutgers fraternity brother Dino Zerilli, he began selling ecstasy to college kids. He was a linebacker for his football team at Boonton High School and was All-State by the end of his semester. Jackie planned the robbery of a Jewel-Amnesty International benefit concert at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers and drove the getaway car for Christopher Moltisanti and Benny Fazio. While waiting in the car, Jackie urinates himself. Jackie Jr. had also dated Tony's daughter, Meadow. Jackie tried to maintain the appearance of a respectable college student dating Meadow while drifting further into the Mafia life. Tony's interest was further increased because he had been a close friend of Jackie's father and had promised that he would keep Jackie Jr. away from organized crime. Tony began to see through Jackie's facade when he caught him at the casino on Bloomfield Ave in Bloomfield, New Jersey and then later at the Bada Bing. Ralph gives Jackie Jr. a .38 revolver at his request. Tony was furious because he had tried so hard to keep Jackie straight, beating him up in the bathroom of the club after catching him there getting a lap dance. Things came to a head after Jackie Jr. flunked out of Rutgers University after he was caught cheating during an exam. Meadow suggested that he enroll in the Fashion Institute of Technology because he said he has a passion for designing men's suits. Meadow later broke up with Jackie after she found him cheating on her. Resentful of Tony's hypocrisy, Jackie began working directly for Ralph, forming his own minor crew in the process. Upon hearing Ralph tell the story of when Jackie's father and Tony robbed a card game held by Feech La Manna, Jackie became inspired to follow in his father's footsteps. Using his dim-witted crew of Carlo Renzi, Dino Zerilli and Matush, Jackie attempted to hold up a card game run by Aprile soldier Eugene Pontecorvo, which Jackie had almost decided not to go through with. At the card game, Jackie killed \\"Sunshine\\" the dealer, made man Furio Giunta was shot in the leg, Carlo was killed at the scene by Christopher, and Matush fled in the getaway car upon hearing gunshots. Jackie escaped by jacking a car. He sped past Dino, who is killed by Christopher and Albert Barese. In \\"Army of One,\\" Jackie hides at a Boonton housing project. Jackie called Tony and begged for help, saying that he was imitating Tony and his father when they were younger. Tony rebuffed Jackie, saying they were different scenarios with different results. At a meeting between Tony and Ralph, they talked about what to do about Jackie. Largely because of his feelings toward Jackie Sr., Tony suggested to Ralph that Jackie should be given a pass for the failed robbery. Ralph gave the order to murder Jackie to Aprile crew soldier (and Jackie's cousin) Vito Spatafore. Outside the Boonton Projects, Vito shot Jackie Jr. in the back of the head as he was out for a walk. Rosalie, Meadow and the rest of the family were told that Jackie was killed by black drug dealers in a drug deal gone bad. Gloria Trillo Gloria Trillo is played by Annabella Sciorra. Gloria is a car saleswoman for Globe Motors, a Mercedes-Benz dealershiphttps://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/cast-and-crew/gloria-trillo \\"No ordinary goomara, she's a smart, beautiful career woman, and a top sales rep at Globe Mercedes.\\" in Fairfield, New Jersey. Like Tony, she is a patient of Jennifer Melfi's. She meets Tony at Melfi's office due to a scheduling mix-up; there is an immediate attraction between the two and within days they are having an affair. She tells Tony that she has \\"murdered\\" seven relationships to date. Although she presents the facade of a strong and independent woman, Gloria is in fact mentally unstable and exhibits signs of Borderline Personality Disorder, which leads to occasional violent arguments and physical altercations with Tony, bouts of severe depression and frequent suicidal thoughts. One such incident occurs after Gloria sees Tony's wife Carmela at her dealership, getting her car serviced, and offers to drive her home. Tony calls it quits and cuts off all contact with her and orders Patsy Parisi to threaten Gloria into staying away from him. Patsy accomplishes this by posing as a customer at the dealership and going on a test drive with Gloria. When they are out of the city, he pulls a gun on her and tells her to never see or talk to Tony or any of his family again. This unbalance eventually leads Gloria to her suicide, hanging herself in her home a year later. Tony later goes back to Globe Motors and inquires after her to another salesman, who confirms her death. Tony later initially blames Melfi for Gloria's death, claiming that she did too little to save Gloria, before blaming himself. Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. is played by Tony Lip. Carmine was an old-school Mustache Pete boss of the Lupertazzi crime family.https://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/cast-and-crew/carmine-lupertazzi He kept a low profile for most of his criminal career while operating out of his social clubs and restaurants in New York City. He lives in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. Carmine was arrested and acquitted of labor racketeering charges in the 1980s. It was around this time that Carmine's longtime consigliere, Angelo Garepe and longtime Lupertazzi family captain Phil Leotardo, were convicted of various racketeering charges and sent to prison, Angelo for 18 years and Phil for 20 years. During Carmine's tenure his family was the largest and wealthiest of the Five Families in New York City. They maintained close ties to New Jersey's DiMeo crime family. Carmine groomed his son and namesake Little Carmine Lupertazzi, by making him a captain in the crime family that bears his name. He had a sometimes contentious relationship with his underboss Johnny Sack; during various episodes in the fourth season, Johnny and Carmine each authorized Tony Soprano to put a \\"hit\\" on the other, although they were both called off at the last minute. In 2004, Carmine's health began to fail and he suffered a massive stroke while having lunch with Tony, Johnny and Angelo Garepe at a country club, and soon after died in hospital. This left a large power vacuum in the Lupertazzi family. The heir apparent for his position was his son Little Carmine, a fact that became a point of consternation for Johnny Sack. Johnny did not think much of Little Carmine and felt as Carmine's underboss, he was next in line to be boss. Even Tony has no faith in Little Carmine's capacity to run New York, jokingly referring to him as \\"Brainless the Second\\". Despite his shortcomings, Little Carmine finds backers in Carmine Sr.'s recently paroled former consigliere, Angelo Garepe, and long-time Lupertazzi Capo Rusty Millio. Angelo and Rusty, along with Rusty's right-hand man Eddie Pietro, pull most of the strings during the war between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine. However, after a cycle of bloodshed that escalates into war, Little Carmine ultimately finds it difficult to stomach the continuing violence and abdicates. His decision was heavily influenced by the murder of Angelo Garepe. After Little Carmine's capitulation, Johnny Sack becomes the boss of the Lupertazzi crime family. Rusty Millio Rusty Millio is played by Frankie Valli. Rusty is a Mustache Pete capo in 2004, when he first appears in the series. He is a capo that controls territory for the family in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Flatbush, Brooklyn, Park Slope, Brooklyn, and territory in Queens. Rusty is a close associate of Little Carmine and considered to be one of the instigators in Little Carmine's power play following his father, and boss, Carmine Lupertazzi Sr.'s death. He helps Angelo Garepe orchestrate a hit on Joe Peeps (with Tony Blundetto as the hitman). He offers Tony Blundetto the contract on Joey Peeps which Tony hesitantly turns down having not made up his mind on his future. While in prison, Johnny Sack later orders a hit on Rusty (whom he referred to as \\"The Mayor of Munchkinland,\\" due to his short stature of 5'5\\") through Tony, because he anticipates Rusty is likely to wrest power away from him. In the episode \\"Luxury Lounge,\\" Rusty and his driver Edward \\"Eddie\\" Pietro, are assassinated in Rusty's driveway by Italian hitmen contracted by Tony. Michele \\"Feech\\" La Manna Michele \\"Feech\\" La Manna is played by Robert Loggia.https://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/cast-and- crew/michele-feech-la-manna Feech is a Mustache Pete who was \\"made\\" in Southern Italy. Feech moved to the US in the 1950s and settled in Hamilton Park, Jersey City where he became involved with the DiMeo crime family in bookmaking and loansharking, then under the leadership of boss Ercole \\"Eckley\\" DiMeo. He also operates a bakery that makes Taralli, a pastry from the region. A young Jackie Aprile Sr. and Tony Soprano robbed his floating high-stakes card game, and thereby solidifying their status as rising mobsters in the organization. Despite Feech's anger at having been robbed, Jackie's older brother, Richie Aprile, then a high-ranking earner and soldier in the family, intervened on Tony and Jackie's behalf and got them both a pass. Silvio Dante reveals they were also helped because both Johnny Soprano and Junior Soprano were powerful capos under DiMeo. When he was released and introduced in season 5, Feech went to see Tony Soprano, the new boss of North Jersey, where he was given permission to get back in the action. After a power struggle with Paulie Walnuts over landscaping territory, Feech stole cars from the valet at Ira Fried's daughter's wedding in Ringwood, New Jersey, and sold them to a dealer in Newburgh, New York. Tony had previously made it clear that Fried was a friend and was not to be touched, but Feech went ahead with his plan anyway. Tony realized that Feech still thought of him as a youngster and saw Junior as the boss, paying his respects and going to Junior about complaints instead of Tony. As a result, Tony instructed Christopher Moltisanti and Benny Fazio to convince Feech to keep a truck of stolen plasma screen televisions in his garage. When a parole officer suddenly appears at his home and discovers the televisions, Feech was arrested, and sent back to prison. Butch DeConcini Butch DeConcini is played by Greg Antonacci. He is from Flatbush, Brooklyn. Butch is a high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi crime family, first appearing in the show as a capo and later being promoted to underboss under Phil Leotardo. He attended Little Carmine Lupertazzi's \\"meeting of minds\\" to try to resolve a dispute with the Soprano crime family in 2006 after Tony responded to the murder of Vito Spatafore by blowing up a wire room in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn that was owned by Phil. After the effort failed, DeConcini was vocal in his desire to move against Tony. When Phil refused to consider killing a boss, it was Butch who suggested they move on someone else in Tony's family. When Phil ordered a hit on Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro to take over the Lupertazzi family, it was Butch who oversaw the assassination behind the wheel of one of the getaway cars. Upon Phil's permanent elevation to boss, Butch was made underboss of the family. Alongside Albie Cianflone, Butch is one of Phil's primary confidants and advisors. Butch fails to eliminate the Soprano family leadership, and he notices Phil's threatening tone regarding his future due to the failure to find and murder Tony. During a sit-down with Tony and Paulie Gualtieri, he, along with Albie Cianflone and Little Carmine, agree to end the war against the Soprano family. While Butch will not reveal where Phil is hiding, he gives consent on behalf of the Lupertazzi family for Tony to hunt down and murder Phil, which he does. ==Minor charactersSoprano crime family=== *Ercole \\"Eckley\\" DiMeo: a.k.a. \\"Old Man\\", is the founder and the longtime boss of the DiMeo crime family. He is an unseen character. By the events of season one, he is boss in name only and never demonstrates any influence over the family due to being incarcerated since 1995, held at United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. *Richard \\"Dickie\\" Moltisanti: Former soldier in the Soprano crew who lived in Paramus, New Jersey next to the Westfield Garden State Plaza, \\"the largest mall in New Jersey\\" with his family. He is an unseen character in The Sopranos. Born before 1959 (when Tony was born) and died in the mid-1970s, Married to Joanne Moltisanti née Blundetto, father of Christopher and cousin to Carmela Soprano. Hugh DeAngelis, the father of Carmela has a sister Lena who is the mother of Christopher Moltisanti's father Dickie, thus making Hugh DeAngelis, a great uncle to Christopher. Dickie was in the U.S. Navy (as was Hugh) stationed at Naval Weapons Station Earle and saw action in the naval battles of the Vietnam War and later served time in prison, making it unlikely that he spent much time with his family when he was alive. It is suggested from his Navy photograph that he was in the Fleet Marine Force. Dickie was killed during Christopher's infancy, outside the house while bringing TV trays home. In 2002, Tony Soprano told Christopher that Dickie's killer was Clifton, New Jersey Detective Lt. Barry Haydu, who had just retired from the force. Tony delivered Haydu to Christopher Moltisanti as a part of his process of bonding Chris to him and slowly easing him up the family hierarchy. However, when confronted by Christopher, Haydu denied having heard of Dickie Moltisanti and claimed that someone was \\"obviously\\" setting him up; however, he inadvertently admitted knowing Dickie Moltisanti by stating \\"Look, whoever told you I had anything to do with his death is lying!\\", before Christopher ever mentioned Dickie's death, whom Haydu supposedly didn't even know. Haydu's last words before he is killed by Christopher are \\"I'm sorry!\\" indicating that he was likely indeed responsible. He is played by Alessandro Nivola in The Many Saints of Newark. *Joseph Siravo (The Sopranos), Jon Bernthal (The Many Saints of Newark) as Giovanni \\"Johnny Boy\\" Soprano: he is Tony Soprano's deceased father, the former captain of the Soprano crew. He was the son of Corrado Soprano Sr. and Mariangela D'Agostino from Ariano in the Province of Avellino who immigrated to the United States in 1911; he was a master stonemason who helped to build a church in Newark, New Jersey. Johnny was married to Livia Pollio and they had three children: Janice, Tony, and Barbara. Johnny worked closely with his older brother Junior during Tony's childhood. Johnny was sent away to prison, for a short while when Tony was young, and the family members said Johnny Boy was in Montana working as a cowboy. Johnny and Junior both went on to become capos in the DiMeo crime family. Johnny was well liked in the organization – before his death, boss Ercoli \\"Eckley\\" DiMeo was thought to have been considering having Johnny take over. Sal \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero and Paulie Gualtieri were both in Johnny's crew. Bonpensiero stood up for Johnny in the unrest of '83, and Johnny's leadership led to Sal's becoming a made man shortly afterward. Both Sal and Paulie followed Johnny's wishes and supported Tony's becoming capo after Johnny's death of emphysema. Johnny took Tony and his friend Silvio Dante under his wing, and brought them up in the organization as part of his crew. Johnny was only seen in flashbacks to Tony's childhood or in Tony's dream sequences. In 1969, Tony witnessed Johnny cut off Francis Satriale's pinky finger while Junior held him in place; Satriale owed gambling debts and was avoiding giving Johnny payment. This event contributed to Tony's first panic attack at the kitchen table that evening. Tony also saw his father and Junior attack Rocco Alatore over a debt, then recalled his father's discussing a possible move to Reno, Nevada in 1967 to manage a supper club for Alatore (who was restored to good terms with Johnny since the debt was repaid) and his mother's refusing, which move Livia would later sweep under the rug when Mr. Alatore later became a billionaire with his investments. It is revealed in the episode \\"A Hit Is a Hit\\" that Johnny was a silent partner in Hesh Rabkin's record company \\"F-Note Records\\". Tony also witnessed Johnny plotting a scheme in 1967 at a children's carnival by bringing Janice along. Tony had originally thought his father favored Janice over him but later learned the truth: that mobsters brought their daughters to their meetings as a ruse. When Janice recalled the time Johnny shot through Livia's beehive hairdo while they were driving home, Tony thought the anecdote was shameful and made their family look \\"dysfunctional\\". Tony described his mother's relationship with his father as wearing Johnny down to \\"a little nub\\"; for her part, Livia tearfully remembers Johnny as \\"a saint\\" several times. Johnny kept a mistress named Fran Felstein, whom he had met during Tony's childhood. In 1976, when Tony was 16, Johnny stayed all night at her home when his pregnant wife was in the hospital. The next morning Johnny and Tony went to the hospital, and Tony lied to his mother saying they went to a New York Yankees baseball game and stayed in New York. Livia saw through Johnny's lie and lost the baby due to bleeding. In September 1982, when his son Tony was 22 years old, and just two weeks before the birth of his granddaughter Meadow, Johnny ordered his son to murder a local bookie: Willie Overall. This was Tony's first murder, and it helped hasten his climb toward becoming a made man. Johnny died of emphysema in late 1986, aged 62. Not long before his death, he saw the incarceration of many of his fellow mobsters due to Fabian \\"Febby\\" Petrulio's becoming a government witness. Johnny never recovered from the news of Febby's betrayal, and it may have hastened his demise. *Ercole \\"Eckley\\" Soprano was an unseen character. Ercole was Tony Soprano's late uncle, the middle son of Corrado Sr. and Mariangela D'Agostino, and brother of Junior and Johnny. He was born between 1924–1928 in East Orange, New Jersey. Tony never met him and finds about his existence from Junior in \\"The Happy Wanderer\\". Junior Soprano tells Tony that he and Johnny Soprano started the high-stakes $5,000-buy in \\"executive\\" Five- card stud poker card game over 30 years before 1999 to help financially support Ercole that brought in big-time players like David Lee Roth and Frank Sinatra Jr.. Ercole had an intellectual disability and developmental disability and was institutionalized in a state-run assisted living institution early in his life by his mother and his existence concealed because of the stigma of having a mentally challenged child at the time. In \\"Do Not Resuscitate\\" while Junior is trying to feign mental incompetence during his RICO trial he remembers how people in the neighborhood used to mock and make fun of Ercole. He was \\"strong as a bull\\" and looked like George Raft. In the episode house arrest after Livia finds out about Tony seeing a psychiatrist, she mentions to Junior that Tony might be on his way to be institutionalized at Essex County Hospital Center \\"(Cedar Grove Mental Hospital)\\" in Cedar Grove, New Jersey. Junior explains that society did not understand these things back then and nowadays they would have enrolled him in a trade school, but praises his mother for making sure Ercole was taken care of at a home in North Jersey. Junior also boasts to Tony that Johnny paid for his care with their criminal proceeds. Tony recalls listening to Johnny Boy and Livia argue and she would mention a \\"feeble-minded brother\\" who at that time Tony always assumed she was referring to Junior Soprano. *George Loros as Raymond \\"Buffalo Ray\\" Curto: he was a capo in the DiMeo crime family. A capo in the DiMeo/Soprano crime family before season 1, Curto is approached by fellow capo Tony Soprano and asked to replace Jackie Aprile Sr. as boss of the DiMeo Crime Family, due to his age and experience, as Jackie is dying of cancer in hospital. Curto declines, and insists, along with the other capos, that Tony should take over instead, fearing Tony's uncle and fellow capo Corrado \\"Junior\\" Soprano would step up as the new boss. However, Curto is also an FBI informant, as revealed in the episode, \\"Proshai, Livushka\\". It has never been disclosed when or why he became an informant, although he is briefly seen in the episode \\"Nobody Knows Anything\\" being busted at a brothel along with Detective Vin Makazian. In 2006, Curto unexpectedly dies of a stroke in his FBI handler's car. Curto was handled by both Agent Robyn Sanseverino and Agent Frank Grasso. *Anthony DeSando as Brendan Filone: he was Christopher Moltisanti's friend and partner in crime and a low-level associate of Tony Soprano. Brendan was addicted to crystal meth, and often used it with Chris. In the episode \\"46 Long\\", Brendan and Chris hijacked a Harrison, New Jersey Comley Trucking truck and stole a number of DVD players. Comley Trucking was under the protection of Junior Soprano, who demanded restitution. At a sit-down, Junior tells Tony to keep Brendan and Christopher's \\"loose cannon\\" behavior under control. In a nightclub, Brendan tries his best to convince Chris to defy Tony and Uncle Junior since both Chris and Brendan were getting nowhere by following the rules. Early the next morning, Brendan urges Chris to get ready for the next heist, a truckload of high-end Italian suits. Christopher tells him that he has decided that he would not participate. Brendan, this time without Christopher, hijacks another Comley truck with two others. In the process, the driver of the truck is accidentally shot and killed by a ricochet bullet when one of Brendan's men drops his gun. Tony is angry when he learns about the hijacking and orders Chris and Brendan to return the truck to Comley. However, Junior is not satisfied. Junior's trigger man Mikey Palmice and sister-in-law Livia Soprano, both give Junior advice on the matter. Junior orders that Chris undergo a mock execution and that Brendan be killed. Brendan is killed while in his bathtub by Mikey, while Junior waits outside in the hall. In the aftermath, Chris and his girlfriend Adriana La Cerva find Brendan's body in his bathtub, and Chris calls for harsh retaliation against Mikey. Tony decides to confront his uncle and Mikey over their severe punishment by beating Mikey to the ground and stapling his jacket to his torso. He then goes to have a sit-down with Junior for his orders. Later, in retaliation for the attempted hit on Tony, Mikey is killed in the woods after Chris and Paulie Gualtieri chase him down while he is jogging. In season two, after Chris is shot by Sean Gismonte and Matthew Bevilaqua, he has a near-death experience in the hospital where he goes to says he went to Hell and explains that he saw Brendan and Mikey playing cards with a bunch of Roman soldiers and Irishmen. Chris also mentions that Brendan and Mikey are friends in Hell. Hearing this, Paulie becomes obsessed with his own fears of ghosts. *Tony Darrow as Lorenzo \\"Larry Boy\\" Barese: he is the caporegime of his own crew which is the biggest in the DiMeo crime family. His cousin, Albert \\"Ally Boy\\" Barese, is his second in command and he is also the godfather of Soprano associate Benny Fazio. In the season 1 episode \\"Pax Soprana,\\" Larry, along with Jimmy Altieri and Raymond Curto, met with Tony after Junior had Mikey Palmice murder Larry's top earner, Rusty Irish, for selling ecstasy to the grandson of one of Junior's friends; the grandson committed suicide while high. Larry and the other capos considered this to be a sign of Junior abusing his power as boss. Larry found out from an FBI secretary that an indictment was going to be issued against the crime family in the New Jersey Superior Court. Soon after, along with Junior and underboss Joseph \\"Beppy\\" Sasso, he was arrested and charged with violations of racketeering and fraud and sent to Green Haven Correctional Facility in Beekman, New York. While being held without bail in prison, Larry promoted his cousin Albert Barese to acting caporegime of his crew. Three years after the indictments, Larry was released following a mistrial and put under house arrest. However, he took control of his crew back from his cousin. At the premier of the fictional slasher film Cleaver that Christopher Moltisanti had produced, Larry was arrested by federal marshals for violating his house arrest. He was in jail awaiting a retrial at the end of the series. *Val Bisoglio as Murf Lupo: Elderly soldier and former capo of Junior Soprano's crew, who is starting to mumble and show signs of Dysarthria when talking and is starting to show the early signs of dementia that worries Junior. Junior also notices that he is starting to look unkempt, with food on the front of his shirt when he goes out and he goes to bed early. *Dan Grimaldi as Phillip \\"Philly Spoons\\" Parisi: Phillip is a soldier and Patsy Parisi's identical twin brother born March 4, 1950, who was born eleven minutes after him in Bloomfield, New Jersey and lives in Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey. He is a third-generation Italian-American whose grandparents were from Ariano Irpino. Junior Soprano mentions that Phillip wears a hairpiece, although his baldness is never shown. *Louis Gross as Perry Annunziata: also known as \\"Muscles Marinara,\\" is from Bloomfield, New Jersey He serves as a bodyguard and chauffeur for Tony Soprano during his recovery from a gunshot in 2006. Tony calls him \\"Penne Arrabiata\\" (as in the pasta dish penne all'arrabbiata), on account of his road rage (Italian: arrabbiato) towards a rude driver while driving Tony. *Vitali Baganov as Valery: Valery was a \\"Bratok\\" in the Russian mob, acquainted with Tony Soprano through his business association with the organization. Valery's friend and boss Slava Malevsky revealed to Tony that they served together in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation where he worked with the Russian Airborne Troops during the First Chechen War in Chechnya. Valery had personally killed 16 Chechen Republic of Ichkeria rebels, saving Slava's life in the process. In \\"Pine Barrens\\", Paulie Walnuts and Christopher Moltisanti visited Valery at his apartment to collect payment. Valery readily handed over the envelope of money, but Paulie responded to a perceived slight by being intentionally careless with Valery's entertainment system. In the ensuing brawl, Christopher and Paulie believed they had killed Valery. They drove out to the Pine Barrens to dispose of him, but when they arrive, find him alive. They marched him into the snow to dig his own grave, but he attacked Paulie and Christopher with the shovel and ran. Christopher and Paulie gave chase, firing as they ran. Paulie seemingly hit Valery in the head, leaving a trail of blood. The two men continued looking for him but eventually gave up, and realized they were lost in the wilderness in the middle of winter. Chris and Paulie then spent a miserable night in an abandoned van in the Pine Barrens. On rescuing the pair, Tony made it clear that if Valery makes it back to North Jersey alive, it would be Paulie who would have to deal with Slava, not him. Valery's fate after this point is unclear; Valery's body was never found, and Paulie's car was stolen from the remote location where it was parked in the wilderness. An HBO promo shows notable characters who have been murdered over the course of the series and does show Valery as having died in this episode, but with a question mark, indicating some doubt. David Chase said in an interview at the Writers' Guild: *Maria Grazia Cucinotta as Isabella: Appears in \\"Isabella\\" as a figment of Tony Soprano's imagination. Soprano sees a beautiful Italian woman in the Cusamanos' garden next door. Isabella tells him that she is a foreign exchange dental student from Avellino, staying there while the Cusamanos are away. He takes her out to lunch. As she describes the beauty of Avellino, where Tony's grandfather came from, he has a drug-induced daydream from the Librium. Isabella is in a village house, in a rocking-chair, nursing a baby named Antonio. Then Isabella is no longer there. When the Cusamanos return and he asks about her, Tony realizes she never existed: it was a delusion. Dr. Melfi instructs him to cease taking lithium, and theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure. *Sofia Milos as Annalisa Zucca: Daughter of Zi Vittorio, head of a Neapolitan Camorra family in Italy. She is also the wife of the acting Camorra boss, Mauro Zucca, who is currently serving a life sentence, and a distant cousin of Tony Soprano. When Tony took over Junior's luxury car hijacking business, he went to visit \\"Zi\\" (Uncle) Vittorio in Naples to discuss the parameters of their arrangement. When he finally meets Zi Vittorio, Tony finds that he is a wheelchair-bound old man, and it is, in fact, Annalisa who runs the organization now. Tony finds this hard to accept at first, but eventually works out a deal with Annalisa—he would cut the price of the cars he supplies to Naples, in exchange for her to supply him with members of her organization. This resulted in Furio Giunta being sent to the United States, and later, in season six, with Tony being supplied with the hitmen to take care of the hit on Rusty Millio, and Philip \\"Phil\\" Leotardo. *Chris Tardio as Sean Gismonte, an associate of the DiMeo crime family from West Orange, New Jersey in Essex County, New Jersey. He was Matthew Bevilaqua's partner in crime and an associate in the Gualtieri crew in 2000. He was born and raised in Hoboken, New Jersey. Sean was convicted of an undisclosed crime and had spent time in county jail and is implied that unlike Matt, Sean has worked pump and dump stock broker scheme before. It is suggested that he attended Lubin School of Business at Pace University with Matt but wanted to pursue a life in crime, considering themselves more intelligent but underappreciated considering their skill set by Chris. Sean and Matt worked with Christopher at various aspects of organized crime including the Massarone Construction site, an over-the-counter (finance) brokerage house in Bayonne, New Jersey that was responsible for a Pump and Dump on the website Webistics, Junior Soprano's executive card game held in a hotel by Newark Liberty International Airport, and some burglary jobs with Matthew and Chris. He was reprimanded for beating a stockbroker and stealing a Porsche Carrera from the parking lot of where the stock brokerage is. Looking to move up in the ranks, Sean and Matt attempted a hit on Christopher as an attempt to win favor from Richie Aprile. The hit was botched and Sean was killed by Christopher in the ensuing gun battle. *Frank Albanese as Patrizio \\"Uncle Pat\\" Blundetto: a former soldier in the Soprano crew worked alongside Johnny Boy Soprano. Chris compares the ruthlessness of Pat to Jake LaMotta. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was able to retire from \\"the business\\". Pat is the uncle of Tony Blundetto and Chris Moltisanti, and father of Louise Blundetto. Tony Soprano calls him Uncle Pat but they are not blood relatives. Pat's brother Al Blundetto married Quintina Pollio, Livia Soprano's sister. Pat owns a farm at New York State Route 146, Route 9a, Kinderhook, Upstate New York that his nephews used to visit in the summers of their youth. In the episode \\"All Due Respect,\\" Tony Blundetto hides out at Pat's now empty farmhouse from the Lupertazzis after shooting Phil Leotardo's brother Billy Leotardo. *Edoardo Ballerini as Corky Caporale: an associate of Christopher Moltisanti and a heroin addict. Christopher enlisted him to accommodate the Italian hitmen provided to Tony for the hit on Rusty Millio. Corky was chosen primarily because he speaks Italian and would therefore be able to communicate effectively with the hitmen. Christopher paid him for the job with heroin. Corky performed well, delivering weapons and instructions at a remote spot without revealing much about himself, and the hit went smoothly. Christopher delivered the second half of Corky's payment at the Feast of St. Elzear and included more heroin as a substitute for some of the money. Corky injected the drug in Christopher' car, which initially prompted Christopher to encourage him to get into rehab. However, Christopher was eventually tempted into joining him. In 2007, in the episode \\"The Blue Comet,\\" now after Christopher's death, the Soprano Family used Corky again through Patsy Parisi. The target this time was Phil Leotardo. Fluent in Italian, Corky assigned Neapolitan hitmen, Italo and Salvatore to the Leotardo hit, but was botched when they mistake the father of Leotardo's Ukrainian mistress for Leotardo, and are both killed instead. When Corky heard from the hitmen that the man spoke Ukrainian to his daughter, he mumbled \\"whatever.\\" However, he did ask Patsy Parisi if Phil spoke Ukrainian. *Tony Siragusa as Frankie Cortese: he served as a driver and bodyguard for Tony as a soldier of the Soprano crime family in 2004. *Jeffrey M. Marchetti as Peter \\"Bissell\\" LaRosa. Bissell, also known as Petey, was part of the group Little Paulie took to vandalize Carmine Lupertazzi's restaurant in the HUD dispute.

Murmur also went out to LA to meet Christopher because Christopher was \\"chipping\\" (relapsing). While there, Murmur and Christopher tried to intimidate Ben Kingsley and robbed Lauren Bacall of a gift basket she received at an awards ceremony. Murmur later attended Christopher' belated bachelor party at Nuovo Vesuvio and continued to hang out with the crew at Satriale's. Murmur was skeptical of the benefits of Christopher's relationship with fellow addict Julianna Skiff, warning Christopher that it could be enabling as codependency (to relapse into substance abuse), and of the possibility of Tony finding out about his recent slip at the Feast of St. Elzear. He was also responsible for informing Tony that Phil Leotardo had a heart attack – Tony had warmed to him a little by this point and rewarded him with a club soda. In 2007, in the episode \\"The Blue Comet,\\" Murmur (unknowingly) informed Paulie and Silvio, by showing them a newspaper article on the murders of two civilians, that Phil Leotardo is still alive and the job to kill him failed because the hitmen had misidentified their target. *John Cenatiempo as Anthony \\"Tony Black\\" Maffei: a soldier in Bobby Baccalieri's crew.

Former made man in the Junior Soprano crew, defected to Tony Soprano's crew in 2000 after he murdered Philly Parisi (the acting capo of Junior's crew while Junior was incarcerated). The hit was ordered by Tony as revenge for Philly spreading rumors about Tony's mother with regard to Tony and Junior's feud. Gigi was quickly made part of the inner circle of Tony's crew unlike fellow new member Patsy Parisi. Gigi made a final transition in the fall of 2000 when he was promoted to the position of capo over the Aprile crew, following Richie Aprile's \\"disappearance\\" making him the only made man in the DiMeo crime family to serve in three different crews. Ralph Cifaretto was angered as he had hoped to receive the promotion himself. Gigi died in the episode \\"He Is Risen\\", after he had a fatal heart attack while constipated on the toilet in his social club. Ralph was subsequently made the captain of the Aprile crew. *Paul Herman as Peter \\"Beansie\\" Gaeta: a former associate of Richie Aprile from Elizabethtown, New Jersey, supervising a drug operation in New Jersey for him. Upon Richie's release from prison, he tracked down Gaeta at his pizza parlor, and demanded payment that he allegedly still owed to him. His pizzerias are used by the DiMeo crime family for money laundering. After Gaeta denied the validity of the debt, Richie first broke a pot over Beansie's head and a beating, and later ran him over with his car, rendering Beansie hospitalized and paraplegic from his injuries (in \\"Toodle Fucking-Oo\\"). Wheelchair-bound, Beansie moved to Miami Beach, Florida. *Anthony J. Ribustello as Dante \\"Buddha\\" Greco: a soldier in the Aprile crew, first seen taking delivery of cigarettes from Christopher Moltisanti on his return from Raleigh, North Carolina.

He was a classmate of Jackie Jr. at Rutgers University. It was his idea to extort protection money from a coffee house at Rutgers and rob the Jewel concert being held at the university but is arrested for drug possession and in jail when the robbery was actually pulled. Jackie Jr. and Carlo Renzi he feels that Ralph Cifaretto is holding them back from their full potential. He looks up in admiration to Christopher Moltisanti who was at that point in time a rising figure in the DiMeo crime family. He was involved in Jackie Jr.'s scheme to rob Eugene Pontecorvo's low-stakes card game to gain the respect of the higher level mobsters. They team up with Carlo Renzi, who wields a heavy shotgun. Things do not go their way when Sunshine gets whacked during the robbery, triggering a barrage of gunshots from both sides. This scuffle leaves Carlo dead and Furio wounded. Dino and Jackie Jr. run for the street, but their getaway wheelman, Matush, had fled out of fear after hearing the gunshots. Jackie boosts an oncoming car and quickly speeds out of the area, leaving Dino to face an angry Christopher Moltisanti and Albert Barese. Dino tries to level with them by mentioning he's with Ralph, but that does not help. Chris and Albert promptly shoot Dino in the face, killing him. *Richard Maldone as Albert \\"Ally Boy\\" Barese: a paternal cousin of Larry Boy Barese; acting capo of the Barese crew when Larry Boy was in jail; soldier in the Barese crew. Larry is involved in price-fixing and bid rigging of waste hauling contracts in New Jersey and New York. In a discussion with Richie Richie Aprile and Tony, Tony says that all the garbage collection routes north of Paterson, New Jersey belong to Barone Sanitation while Larry Boy Barese and his firm Sani-Cruiser and the D'Allessio brothers divide up the rest. The crew's contest for the routes continued as Albert was briefly involved in a \\"garbage war\\" with Ralph Cifaretto who claimed to be a \\"capo\\" of his own crew. Larry burned two of Ralph Cifaretto's dumpsters and Ralph torched one of Larry's garbage trucks in West Side, Newark, New Jersey. *Frank John Hughes as Walden Belfiore: a soldier in the Gervasi crew of the DiMeo Crime Family. He reveals he was named after singer Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto). Walden was a bodyguard at the safe-house when Tony goes into hiding after the death of Bobby Bacala and the incapacitation of Silvio Dante. In the final episode, Benny Fazio and Belfiore locate Phil Leotardo and Belfiore shoots Phil in the head and chest before making a getaway with Fazio. *Ron Castellano as Terrence \\"Terry\\" Doria: a soldier of Carlo Gervasi's crew. *Artie Pasquale as Burt Gervasi: a younger paternal cousin to Carlo Gervasi and uncle to Carlo's sons Jason and Justin Gervasi. Burt was made a formal member of the Soprano crime family in 2006, at the same time as Phil Leotardo's soldier Gerry Torciano was made a capo in the Lupertazzi family. He lives with his wife Lorraine and toy terrier Spencer. He and Patsy Parisi run the North Ward Emergency Merchants Protective Cooperative: an extortion racket hitting storeowners in New Jersey. As revealed in the episode \\"The Blue Comet,\\" according to Silvio Dante, Burt was eventually swayed to take the side of the Lupertazzi Family and went to Silvio to convince him to go along in a coup d'état, but Silvio instead responded by garroting him to death in his home the next day. *Robert Desiderio as \\"Black\\" Jack Massarone: he is the owner of Massarone Brothers Construction in Fairfield, New Jersey. In 2004, Jack had become a federal informant and wore a wire concealed in a baseball cap to several meetings with Tony. In a discussion between Frank Cubitoso and the District Attorney at FBI headquarters, it is said that Massarone is offering information on the stolen airline tickets case involving Livia Soprano in 2002, the jury tampering investigation of Junior Soprano's RICO trial and the Matthew Bevilaqua murder in 2000. But the D.A. tells Cubitoso that even if Massarone and a hundred other snitches were called to testify against Tony Soprano it would not be enough to convict him in trial. Tony realized something off when he was tipped off by Patsy Parisi that one of his meetings with Massarone was staked-out at the \\"Neapolitan Diner\\" in Fairfield, New Jersey by the FBI. Raising Tony's suspicions further was the fact that Massarone gave him a framed picture of the Rat Pack at that meeting, and later asked him if he had lost weight. Jack was murdered and found in the trunk of his car with a golf club cover stuffed in his mouth. *Sig Libowitz as Hillel Teittleman: a Hasidic Jew and co-owner of a motel with his brother-in-law Ariel who worked there with his father-in-law. In 1999, his brother-in-law Ariel used his ending marriage to negotiate a share in the Teitlemann's motel.

They are frequent customers at the Bada Bing!. They steal money via the Internet with acquired credit card information from customers of various businesses, as per the scam of Christopher and \\"Murmur\\". They later seek help from Christopher in purchasing TEC-9 semi-automatic pistols, which they claim they need \\"for a family matter\\". In the episode \\"Walk Like a Man,\\" Tony passed their names and Ahmed's cell phone number to the FBI. The FBI agents do not recognize them at first, but later tell Tony they may be involved in Terrorism financing. In the series finale \\"Made in America,\\" Tony passes details of their Mitner First Merchants' Bank to Agent Harris hoping to gain information on Phil Leotardo's location in return. *Nick Tarabay as Matush Giamona: an ecstasy dealer who has had some association with the Soprano/DiMeo business over the years. He was often found in and around the West Long Branch, New Jersey alternative rock Crazy Horse nightclub owned by Adriana LaCerva, and initially, Furio and Chris were hostile to him and threw him off the premises. With the reassurance of Jackie Jr., he returned to dealing outside the club and was put in the hospital by Furio, in traction with his jaw wired shut. Chris did not want Matush dealing inside The Crazy Horse because ecstasy was a class A narcotic and would bring attention of drug task forces and police scrutiny. Matush was later recruited as a driver in Jackie Junior's failed robbery of a card game in 2001. He bolted with the car as soon as the robbery went awry leaving Dino Zerilli to be caught and killed and forcing Jackie Jr. to improvise his own escape. In 2004, Matush had returned to dealing at the Crazy Horse – Adriana's drug habit and Furio's disappearance made the club more welcoming. He murdered an upset customer, named Gilbert Nieves, in Adriana's office, and forced her to help him dispose of the body. Another dealer, Kamal, was also involved. This was recorded by FBI surveillance outside and was instrumental in Adriana's attempt to flip Christopher that resulted in her death. *Gregory Alan Williams as Reverend Herman James Jr.: he is from Newark, New Jersey and his heritage can be traced back to Confederation, when his grandfather was a slave on a plantation. His father was WWII veteran and a United Association plumber and belonged to the same union as the one they were extorting. Herman arranged a secret deal with Tony, assisting in a shakedown of a Massarone Brothers construction and real estate development company: James organized a group of African-American union plumbers to argue about being paid low wages because of perceived racial employment discrimination by Black Jack Massarone at a job site. The Soprano associates Sean Gismonte, Matt Bevilaqua and Bobby Baccalieri Jr. then attacked with baseball bats, adding drama to the protest and causing a riot. James and Soprano then split the earnings. He is a friend of Assemblyman Ronald Zellman. *Richard Portnow as Harold Melvoin: he is Junior Soprano's lawyer from 1999 to 2004. Following Junior's arrest on Federal Racketeering charges, Mel allows him to use his office to conduct business as it is one of the few places he is allowed to visit while under house arrest. He allows Junior and Tony to use his office to meet with Angelo Garepe and Lorraine Calluzzo. It is also one of the places that the FBI is not allowed to wiretap. He conducts Junior's defense throughout his first RICO trial and helps Junior with such schemes as hiring an audio engineer expert witness and sound engineer minimization expert to dispute what is recorded on the tapes from Green Grove Retirement Home, getting him released from house arrest so he can attend several funerals including Jackie Aprile Sr., Jackie Aprile Jr., Bobby Baccalieri Sr., Karen Baccalieri and Febby DeAngelis, exaggerating about a benign malignant growth on Junior's body to get him a compassionate release and pretending that a (presumably) minor head injury from being hit by a boom microphone and falling on the Mitchell H. Cohen United States Courthouse steps in Camden, New Jersey has affected his cognitive ability to stand trial. Hal charges Junior $1,000,000 for his RICO trial. Following his stroke, it is predicted that it will be nine months to a year before he will be able to work a full schedule again and that they will have to postpone Junior's trial. After having a stroke which affects his ability to speak, Melvoin is fired by Junior, who considers his attorney's weakened condition a reminder of his own mortality. *David Margulies as Neil Mink: he is Tony Soprano's lawyer. He advises Tony to stay off the street and distance himself from the day-to-day work of his crew – this contributes to Tony's insulating himself by communicating through closely trusted friends whenever possible. He also advises Tony to spend more time in the legitimate businesses, such Barone Sanitation, instead of Bada Bing. When Janice Soprano attacks another soccer mom at Sophia Baccalieri's soccer game in Essex County, New Jersey at Summit Avenue Park in The Palisades, Janice wants to sue the Essex County Sheriff's Office for wrongful arrest. But Tony demands that Janice see Neil and plea the charges down as to not increase media attention and not make it a cause célèbre. In the final episode, \\"Made in America\\", Mink informs Tony that the government most likely will indict him on federal weapons charges stemming from the arrest made in \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" at the beginning of the season, and it is strongly implied that he could consequently be facing a prison sentence for Criminal possession of a weapon. He also says that the Essex County Prosecutor's Office has a witness testifying for a grand jury, but whose identity is unknown, although it is believed to be Carlo Gervasi. *Peter Riegert as Ronald Zellman: an Assemblyman (member of the lower house of the state legislature) for the East Ward consisting of Four Corners (Newark), Five Corners, Newark, Gateway Center (Newark) and The Ironbound and acted as a political operative on behalf of the Soprano crime family. He aided them in securing the Esplanade construction contract. Zellman was a friend of the Reverend Herman James Jr. Zellman also helped Tony set up the HUD scam by introducing him to Maurice Tiffen, a friend of Zellman's from his days at the University of Michigan. His influence later allowed A.J. to be released from police custody, with no charges filed, following his failed attempt to kill his great-uncle Junior, in the Wycoff Rehabilitation Clinic in Wyckoff, New Jersey. ===Lupertazzi crime family=== *Patti D'Arbanville as Lorraine Calluzzo: an associate of the Lupertazzi crime family, known as \\"the lady shylock.\\" During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi's death in 2004, Lorraine kicked up to Little Carmine, who was also reportedly her lover as well as her second cousin. Phil Leotardo roughed her up and even shot at her (using a telephone directory to stop the bullet) during a shakedown, warning her to stop cutting in Little Carmine. Lorraine sought a sit down with Tony Soprano through Angelo Garepe to ask him to intercede in the Lupertazzi infighting. During a sit down Christopher suggests that John ask for a share of Little Carmine's night club businesses in South Beach, Miami and let him keep Lorraine under his crew, something John turns down saying if he wanted Little Carmine's businesses he'd move to Miami. Tony suggests to keep the peace that John Sacrimoni, Angelo Garepe and Phil Leotardo operate the family under a triumvirate to help keep the peace with Lorraine, because Carmine Sr. did not name a successor. Lorraine and her lover are eventually murdered at her home by Phil, his brother William \\"Billy\\" Leotardo and associate Joseph Joseph \\"Joey Peeps\\" Peparelli. *Michael DeNigris as Charles \\"Chucky\\" Cinelli: he is the owner of Cinelli Sanitation – the Lupertazzi crime family's waste management front in Jamaica, Queens where John Sacramoni works. He was involved in a dispute with Jason Barone over Newark, New Jersey-based Barone Sanitation following the death of Dick Barone in 2006 which ended with his buying the company and merging. While going over the payroll he finds discrepancies with consultant Tony Soprano, Paulie Gualtieri and Johnny Sack, but is told to mind his own business by a savvy employee who is in the know. Cinelli agrees (as dictated to by John Sacrimoni) to keep Tony Soprano employed until 2009 (this is later extended to 2015) as a waste management consultant and to keep his health insurance package and Form W-2, plus 5% (later increased to 12%) of Barone Sanitation sale price, in exchange to give up his share of skimming profits ($2,000 a month), and that Cinelli leases him a new car. A Barone Sanitation employee is badly beaten by mob-associated Cinelli Sanitation workers over the dispute. John Sacrimoni is on the payroll as a waste management consultant at Cinelli Sanitation, even after his incarceration. Jason tries to convince Charles to compensate Tony Soprano and Paulie Gualtieri in the sale of Barone Sanitation, something that Cinelli is adamant against, telling Jason it could come out of his end. Jason tells Chuckie that he wants to redefine the deal and open up the sale to other potential buyers. *Armen Garo as Salvatore \\"Coco\\" Cogliano: he is a soldier in the Lupertazzi crime family. While inebriated from drinking Sambuca with Albie Cianflone, he makes aggressively lewd remarks to Meadow Soprano while she is on a dinner date with Patrick Parisi (son of Patsy Parisi) in Little Italy, Manhattan. Shortly after the date, Meadow tells Tony of the incident but he brushes it off as public intoxication, Tony Soprano severely pistol-whips and curb-stomps him in his restaurant, knocking his teeth out in the presence of Butch DeConcini. This leads Phil Leotardo to shut down a Hackensack, New Jersey shopping mall construction site with a United Association plumber's strike, of which Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. has the scaffolding contract for. Carmine Jr. says that in attacking Coco he was being prudent. Carmine Jr. brokers a meeting with Butch DeConcini and Phil and offers Phil a palette of Mikita drills as a peace offering over the attack on Coco. Phil mentions the attack on Salvatore, the forced disappearance and murder of Dominick Gamiello in \\"Cold Stones\\" and the murder of his brother Billy Leotardo in \\"Long Term Parking\\" as a reason to murder the entire upper management of the DiMeo crime family. Butchie says that \\"Coco\\" is an okay guy which suggests that he has good standing in the Lupertazzi crime family, but Tony suggests that, possibly, he is a borderline alcoholic. His name could have been taken from former Lucchese crime family underboss and acting boss, Ettore (\\"Eddie\\") Coco, who served under Carmine Tramunti. *Dominic Chianese Jr. as Dominic: he is a member of the Lupertazzi crime family. *Frank Fortunato as Jason Evanina: he is a partner of Lorraine Calluzzo. During the infighting following boss Carmine Lupertazzi's death, Lorraine kicked up to Little Carmine. When Lorraine does not comply with Phil Leotardo's orders, Phil returns with Billy Leotardo and Joe Peeps. Jason is killed off-screen, as Lorraine tries to escape, she is killed by Billy not far from where she discovers Jason's dead body. *Tony Cucci as Dominic \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamiello: he is a made man of the Lupertazzi crime family under Phil Leotardo. Gamiello joined with Gerry Torciano in murdering Vito in a hotel in Fort Lee, New Jersey because of Vito's homosexuality, while Leotardo watched. He commented to Phil Leotardo that Vito was \\"a disgrace\\" to organized crime. He runs a high-stakes card game in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Later, Dom visited Satriale's to deliver money to Silvio Dante and Carlo Gervasi. Although Fat Dom starts passive-aggressively insulting Vito and crudely implies that Gervasi is homosexual, Silvio silenced him with a blow to the back of the head with a dustbuster. Silvio told Carlo to just \\"hit him\\" but Carlo repeatedly and fatally stabbed Dominic in the stomach with a butcher knife. Dominic's murder infuriated Tony Soprano and Silvio and Carlo closed Satriale's to dispose of the body. Carlo and Silvio first planned to dismember his body but finally decided to bury it at a construction site and ditch the car somewhere along the U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey. They decapitate Dom's head off screen when dismembering his corpse. Carlo was seen disposing of Dom's severed head (which he was keeping in a deep freezer at his house on the Jersey Shore) at the beginning of the next episode, by shoving it down a storm drain along Connecticut Route 3. *Joe Santos as Angelo Garepe: he is consigliere to Carmine Lupertazzi for 30 years (1956 to 1986) before his incarceration at United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth where he served 18 years. Infighting occurred amongst the members of the Lupertazzi crime family following Carmine's death. Angelo chose Little Carmine's side along with capo Rusty Millio. During the infighting, Angelo recruited his old friend, Tony Blundetto, to murder Joseph \\"Joey Peeps\\" Peparelli—an associate of Johnny Sack and member of Phil Leotardo's crew. Following this, Phil and his brother, Billy Leotardo, killed Angelo. Angelo's murder had two major repercussions—it caused Little Carmine to forfeit, making Johnny Sack the undisputed successor to Carmine, Sr. It also provoked Tony Blundetto to pursue the Leotardos, shooting and killing Billy Leotardo while wounding Phil. This nearly started a war between the New York and New Jersey crews, and anger from this conflict remained until the conclusion of The Sopranos. *Lou Martini, Jr. as Anthony Infante: he is Ginny Sacrimoni's brother and Johnny Sack's brother-in-law. Infante is an optometrist, but also serves as a reluctant back-channel through which Tony Soprano and Johnny Sack communicates while Johnny is in federal detention. *Greg D'Agostino as Jimmy Lauria: he is an associate of the Little Italy, Manhattan Leotardo crew. Takes part in the beat down on Hesh's son-in-law Eli in Mill Basin, Brooklyn with Gerry Torciano. Phil thought that Eli was an independent loanshark who was lending out money without making payments to Gerry. Later attends the meeting with Tony, Hesh, Phil Leotardo and Gerry Torciano to make restitution for Hesh's son-in-law's injuries from a hit and run that happened when Eli tried to run from Jimmy and Gerry. They agree to pay $50,000 for pain and suffering. *Chris Caldovino as William \\"Billy\\" Leotardo: he was a soldier in Phil Leotardo's Little Italy, Manhattan crew and Phil's younger brother. Billy killed Lorraine Calluzzo and Jason Evanina with his friend Joe Peeps. Following Carmine Lupertazzi's death, a power struggle between Johnny Sack and Little Carmine ensued. One side was led by Carmine's underboss, Johnny Sack, while the other was ostensibly led by Carmine's son and Miami capo, \\"Little Carmine\\" Lupertazzi. Joe Peeps was killed soon after and Billy took part in the response – a hit on Angelo Garepe in \\"The Test Dream\\". Billy himself was killed in \\"All Due Respect,\\" by Tony Blundetto in revenge for the death of his friend Angelo, causing lasting distress to his brother Phil, who was wounded in the attack. He is cremated and his urn is kept on a shelf behind the bar of Phil Leotardo's Little Italy social club. *Joe Maruzzo as Joseph \\"Joey Peeps\\" Peparelli: he is an associate in Phil Leotardo's crew and an aide-de-camp to Johnny Sack, often going to high-level sit-downs with him. Joey had contacted an Asian hitman \\"Jerry from Fort Lauderdale, Florida\\" that Johnny ordered to kill Ralph in Delray Beach, Florida, and subsequently tells the hitman to call off the murder when Johnny decides against it, agreeing to pay him extra for his trouble. During the infighting amongst the Lupertazzi crime family, Joey and Billy Leotardo kill lady shylock Lorraine Calluzzo, and her partner Jason Evanina, for kicking payments up to Little Carmine instead of to Johnny Sack. In retaliation, Soprano family member Tony Blundetto is hired for a hit on Joey, who is shot to death along with a prostitute in the front seat of his Lincoln Town Car when leaving a Manhattan brothel that he collects protection money from. At Joey's funeral, Tony Soprano is aghast that his crew had a formal headstone carved with the name \\"Peeps,\\" instead of his proper surname \\"Peparelli.\\" *Vinny Vella as James \\"Jimmy\\" Petrille: he is a friend of Johnny Sack's from Brooklyn who became his consigliere once Johnny took over as boss of the family. When Billy Leotardo is shot dead by Tony Blundetto, Jimmy is the one that calls Tony Soprano and tells him. Later, he sits in on one of the discussions with Tony and Phil over the Tony Blundetto situation and tells Phil that he gets emotional when he drinks wine. He is also the one that notifies Tony Soprano by telephone from a deli in Little Italy, Manhattan in code that John Sacrimoni took over the reign of the family from Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. in a bloodless coup. However, it is revealed in \\"All Due Respect\\" that Petrille had been a cooperating witness with the FBI and gave up information on transport truck hijacking and drug dealing going back to Sacrimoni's criminal activities in 1981, which was instrumental in Johnny's arrest by the Brooklyn District Attorney and the FBI. *Nick Annunziata as Eddie Pietro: he is a soldier in Rusty Millio's crew and his right-hand man.

Doc had him brazenly murdered while he ate dinner with Silvio Dante. Phil avenges his long-felt humiliations and has Doc murdered, along with his bodyguard, outside a massage parlour and brothel in Chinatown, Manhattan, cementing his own claim to be the boss. One of the gunmen shoots out Santoro's right eye. Butch DeConcini is one of the getaway drivers. Tony Soprano and the crew learn of Santoro's murder from watching a televised news report at the Bada Bing. *John Bianco as Gerardo \\"Gerry\\" Torciano: he was a protégé of Phil Leotardo. Torciano and Jimmy Lauria got into an altercation with Hesh Rabkin and his son-in-law Eli over extortion money collections being done on the crew's territory in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. Torciano's men burned them out of his car, beat up Eli, and slugged Rabkin. As Eli fled he was hit by a taxi cab in a hit and run and hospitalized. Later, Torciano apologized to Tony, claiming that he thought Eli was a civilian and paid Eli $50,000 in restitution for his injuries. He was made official captain in 2006. Dominick \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamiello and Torciano murdered Vito Spatafore in his motel room while Leotardo watched. When Santoro took over from Sacrimoni, Gerry told Silvio Dante that he was surprised that Phil Leotardo seemed to have lost his drive to become boss of the Lupertazzi family. On April 15, 2007, Gerry died at the hands of a hitman (on orders from Faustino \\"Doc\\" Santoro) in a Brooklyn, New York restaurant while dining with Soprano family consigliere Silvio Dante who was used as a diversion and their respective dates. John Sacrimoni hears about Gerry's death from an orderly in the prison hospital. *John \\"Cha Cha\\" Ciarcia as Albert \\"Albie\\" Cianflone: he is the reputed consigliere to Phil Leotardo. Albie is a former soldier in the Leotardo crew, and has worked for Phil Leotardo since the 1980s. After Johnny Sack was arrested and indicted on various charges, Phil was promoted to acting boss, and Albie was made new consigliere. Albie helped mediate the Barone Sanitation dispute with the Soprano crime family. Alongside newly made underboss Butch DeConcini, Albie was one of Phil's most trusted advisors and confidants. After Phil hatches the plot to kill the entire regime of the Soprano crime family, Albie first protests in shock that taking out an entire family is impossible, however, he later agrees with Phil's decision. Along with Butch, Albie plans the executions of Tony Soprano, Silvio Dante and Bobby Baccalieri. In the final episode, \\"Made in America\\", Albie meets with Tony, Paulie Gualtieri, Little Carmine, Butch DeConcini, and George Paglieri, in New York, where the Lupertazzis agree to end their war with the Sopranos. ===FBI agents=== *Michael Kelly as Ron Goddard: he is Agent Harris' new partner in 2006 in the Joint Terrorism Task Force and was stationed in Islamabad, Pakistan.

He handled mob capo and informant Raymond Curto who was planning to have him testify as a cooperating witness against Tony Soprano and Ralph Cifaretto among others. During a raid on the North Caldwell, New Jersey Soprano residence, Grasso broke a bowl from the kitchen refrigerator. Immediately after, he and Tony developed a grudge when Tony noted his last name and insulted him in Italian. He is an homage to famous New York City Detective Sonny Grosso who helped reveal the French Connection. Tony says that if it weren't for Grasso's last name they'd have him sweeping up at the office, and implies that the other FBI agents probably search him before he leaves work to go home every day. Tony thinks that Grasso is arresting \\"his own people\\", fellow Italian-Americans, to get promoted. *Karen Young as Robyn Sanseverino: she is an FBI agent who handled Adriana La Cerva after she became very resentful against Agent Ciccerone. She also handled capo Raymond Curto just before his death from natural causes. Adriana blames her ulcerative colitis on the pressure being placed on her to be a cooperating witness by Robyn and the FBI. She hints to Adriana that Richie Aprile and Pussy Bonpensiero are dead and not in the Witness Protection Program, despite what Tony Soprano and the others say. *Lola Glaudini as Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup: she is a special agent who went undercover as \\"Danielle Ciccolella from Whippany, New Jersey\\" to befriend Adriana and to find out information about Christopher Moltisanti's relationship with Tony Soprano. She is married to FBI Special Agent Mike Waldrup and has a child with him. She poses as a wealthy woman interested in the gangster world and initially makes contact with Adriana in a Nutley, New Jersey shopping mall. Her usefulness as an undercover agent ended after Christopher tried to seduce her, causing Adriana to break off their friendship. However, Deborah continued to work on the Soprano task force. She meets Adriana at a bakery in East Hanover Township, New Jersey after her Danielle identity is dropped.

His father, a French-Canadian from Quebec named Eugene, took him back to Montreal and Janice states that she tried to petition the State Department to have him returned to her. He did not see much of his mother Janice. While married to Eugene and living in Seattle, one of their neighbors killed themselves over depression. Janice tried to send Harpo to military school in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the same one that Tony tries to send AJ to, but Tony says that \\"Janice was too late for him.\\" Janice never told Bobby the Third or Sophia Baccalieri about their step-brother until Tony brought it up during a family dinner. In the episode \\"Proshai, Livushka,\\" Janice mentions that Harpo had become homeless when Tony proposes flying him in for Livia's funeral. In season 5, she says she mentioned Harpo to Bobby once, but that the topic of him is never brought up in the family again.

She contemplated having an abortion. Tracee later met Ralph at the Bada Bing lounge, where she insulted him in front of the other associates and capos. Ralph followed her out to the deserted parking lot, where he teased her into thinking he would actually marry and support her. He then abruptly changed his tone and gleefully made snide remarks that her daughter would end up as a \\"cocksucking slob\\" just like her. Outraged, Tracee slapped him and insulted his masculinity, which led to Ralph brutally beating her to death. An enraged Tony assaulted Ralph due to his \\"disrespect of the Bing\\". *Alla Kliouka Schaffer as Svetlana Kirilenko: she is a cousin of Tony's ex-mistress, Irina, and is manager of a home health/nursing business.

Shortly thereafter she appears as the last in a series of home health nurses the Sopranos hire to care for Livia Soprano, after her primary caregiver and daughter, Janice, suddenly flees town in the aftermath of Richie Aprile's death. After Livia dies, Tony allows Svetlana to continue living in Livia's house, until she can find her own place to live. She later works as a temporary replacement for Uncle Junior's nurse, Branca (who works for her), after he falls at the courthouse. One afternoon while Uncle Junior is asleep, Tony has sex with Svetlana on Junior's sofa. Irina soon finds out about this and informs Carmela about the affair, prompting Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their ultimate separation. *Leslie Bega as Valentina La Paz: she was Tony's mistress during seasons 4 and 5. She is of Cuban and Italian descent. She was originally Ralph Cifaretto's girlfriend but was drawn to Tony after they met at Hesh's horse stable. The following day, Tony and Valentina have sex in a hotel room. Subsequently, after not being able to bear any more of Ralph's masochistic inclinations, she breaks up with Ralph and begins dating Tony exclusively, which Tony later reveals to Ralph. As Ralph is rather preoccupied at that time with his son Justin's severe medical condition, he shrugs it off and is seemingly indifferent about it. In the Season Five episode \\"The Test Dream\\", after she pushes Tony to make a decision about staying with his wife or being committed to her, her robe catches fire while trying to cook for Tony. Tony quickly extinguishes the fire, but Valentina sustains second degree burns on her scalp. Although it is soon discovered that Valentina will fully heal from the wounds without the need for skin grafts or any scarring, Tony breaks the news to her that he is going back to Carmela. He tells her that he will pay for the doctor's bills and also pay for a wig for her to wear until her hair grows back. *Julianna Margulies as Julianna Skiff: she was a realtor working for Century 21 and trying to purchase a building owned by Tony, Caputo's Poultry, around the corner from Satriale's, for $330,000. It is a poultry hatchery that the prospective buyers want to turn into a Jamba Juice. She was persistent in pursuing the deal, contacting Tony at Satriale's and the Bada Bing and over the phone. At the Bada Bing, Tony seduced Julianna but she told him she was going to exercise self-control and decline because she was engaged. Despite Tony's initial misgivings, her third offer was high enough for him to accept the deal. Tony met her at her home to sign the papers, and they started kissing and began to undress one another, but Tony abruptly ends the encounter and walks out. Following her rejection by Tony, Julianna went to an AA meeting. There she met Christopher Moltisanti who was also in attendance and who remembered her from when she first approached Tony at Satriale's. He introduced himself after the meeting and invited her for coffee, which prompted the beginning of an extramarital affair. Tony reinitiated his pursuit of Julianna when they met to close the Caputo's Poultry real estate deal and she was initially polite in declining any further contact with him. Ignoring warnings from both of their sponsors that Christopher and Julianna's relationship would be enabling for the two recovering addicts, they began smoking heroin together. *David Strathairn as Robert Wegler: he is AJ's guidance counselor who had a sexual relationship with Carmela Soprano while she was separated from her husband Tony.

Tony later pranked Bruce by asking him to hold onto a package filled with sand for him, for an unspecified length of time, without telling Bruce what was in it. Bruce and his wife were tempted to open the package but terrified to know what it held.

Joan is also played by Saundra Santiago. *Robert Patrick as David Scatino: he is a childhood friend of Tony Soprano and Artie Bucco. He owns the local sporting goods store, Ramsey Sports and Outdoors. His son, Eric, was a good friend of Meadow.

Unlike Tony's mother though, Nucci was grateful for Paulie for doing this for her. However, her old friends, Cookie Cirillo and Minn Matrone were far from friendly and tried to exclude her from social activities. To avenge his mother's honor, Paulie sent Benny and her grandson Little Paulie to badly beat Cookie's son, after which the two were forced to include her. Paulie later murdered Minn Matrone for her money. Paulie learns from his aunt Dottie's deathbed, who is a nun, that she is his biological mother and that Nucci adopted him to hide the scandal. When Paulie hears this, he cuts off all contact with both of them, refusing to attend Dottie's funeral or pay for Nucci's accommodation at Green Grove. Later, Paulie visited her at Green Grove (now paid for by her biological son) and they had a silent reconciliation. In episode \\"Kennedy and Heidi,\\" she died on a chartered bus of a stroke while returning from a production of The Jersey Boys, however her funeral was poorly attended, as a majority of the people went to Christopher Moltisanti's concurrent funeral, much to Paulie's ire as he felt Christopher always out-shined him in life, and even manages it in death. *Michele Santopietro as JoJo Palmice: she was the wife of Mikey Palmice. *Anna Mancini (and Donna Pescow in \\"Made in America\\") as Donna Parisi: she is married to longtime Soprano soldier Pasquale \\"Patsy\\" Parisi and sister-in-law to Phillip Parisi. *Michael Drayer as Jason Parisi: he is the younger son of Donna and Patsy Parisi and nephew of Phillip \\"Philly Spoons\\" Parisi.

After the murder of his father for his homosexuality, Vito became increasingly isolated and hostile, and started to dress and hang around with kids in the Gothic subculture.

The two soon reconcile after Vito decides to \\"stop living a lie\\" and became Jim's live-in lover. The pair enjoyed romantic dinners, motorcycle rides, and picnicking lakeside. He gets Vito a job as a contractor working for some of his friends, a job which turns out to be very slow-paced. Ultimately, Vito missed his family and fast-paced lifestyle back in New Jersey too much to stay with Jim. Vito left Jim's house early one morning to return to New Jersey while Jim was still asleep. Vito would later call Jim, but Jim was still angry over the way Vito had left and wanted nothing more to do with him. Vito was violently murdered soon thereafter. *Geraldine LiBrandi as Patty Leotardo: she is married to Lupertazzi crime family acting boss Phil Leotardo.

Ginny's figure is the subject of numerous jokes by members of the DiMeo crime family, and this leads to a dispute between her husband and Ralph Cifaretto. Johnny is willing to kill to defend her honor and viciously attacks a member of Ralph's crew, who Johnny mistakenly believes was telling jokes at Ginny's expense. Ginny attended her daughter Allegra's wedding and was ecstatic when Johnny was allowed to attend, despite being in prison awaiting trial. Her day ended on a low note when US Marshals blocked her daughter's departure and dragged her sobbing husband off in handcuffs causing Ginny to faint. Ginny was in court when Johnny admitted his involvement with the Mafia and received a 15-year sentence for racketeering.

A.J. eventually proposes marriage to Blanca and she accepts, but later changes her mind and ends the relationship, sending A.J. into an emotional downward spiral that results in an attempted suicide. *Cameron Boyd as Matt Testa: he is a friend of A.J. *Tim Daly as J.T. Dolan: he is a screenwriter and an acquaintance of Christopher Moltisanti from rehab in Hazlet, New Jersey. He became addicted to heroin, cocaine and alcohol and later lost his job after not completing a script for Nash Bridges. He later went to a rehabilitation clinic in Pennsylvania (where he first met Christopher) and was successful in turning his life around. J.T. dabbles in gambling and places horse bets with Christopher and finds a fondness for high- price poker games. J.T. borrows money from Christopher to play high-stakes poker and their friendship is effectively ended when he fails to pay it back on time. Little Paulie Germani and Chris beat J.T. up in his home and confiscate his BMW as a partial payment for his debts. Despite the beating, Chris later resumes their \\"friendship\\" when the debt has caused J.T. to relapse. As J.T. Dolan is enrolling in rehab again, Chris freezes the debt and assures J.T. that he will return to prosperous screenwriting. Later, as J.T was working in Los Angeles, California as a full-time professor of a writer's class \\"The Writer's Block\\", Chris has J.T. forcibly abducted by \\"Murmur\\" and Benny Fazio and offers to clear the gambling debt if J.T. writes a screenplay for his feature movie project. He also gets a meeting with René Balcer. J.T. agrees and writes the script for Cleaver, a slasher horror film, from a story by Christopher, working on the film closely with Moltisanti and Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. who is its co-executive producer. However, when the film gets made in 2007, at its premiere, Christopher does not acknowledge Dolan's contributions to it when talking to the audience, leaving him embarrassed in front of his female companions. When Christopher relapsed again in 2007, after his latest feud with Paulie Gualtieri and assumed ridicule and disrespect by the crime family, he attempted to find comfort by talking to J.T. one night. J.T. was cold and unreceptive, angry at his unannounced intrusion and under pressure to finish a script deadline for Law & Order SVU. Heavily drunk, Christopher said that he had seen and done terrible things and started hinting his knowledge of mob crimes. J.T. angrily tried to get Christopher to stop talking about them, suggesting that he did not want to know. J.T. exclaimed \\"Chris, you're in the Mafia!\\", Christopher walked away, then turned and shot him in the head, killing him instantly. *Patty McCormack as Liz La Cerva: she is the mother of Adriana La Cerva and the sister of Jackie Aprile Sr. and Richie Aprile and sister-in-law to Rosalie Aprile. Liz did not support Adriana's relationship with Christopher Moltisanti and Adriana often stayed with her, following arguments or domestic violence. When Chris proposes to Ade in front of Liz, she explains Chris' behavior as abusive power and control. Following her disappearance in 2004, Liz was visited by the FBI who informed her that her daughter was believed to be dead and that they suspected Chris' involvement. When Carmela Soprano encountered her at the 2006 Feast of St. Elzear, Liz, having become convinced of her daughter's murder, showed evident signs of depression. She later attempted suicide. Carmela visited her in the hospital, but Liz appeared to be unconscious at the time. *Lewis J. Stadlen and John Pleshette as Dr. Ira Fried: he is a player in the Soprano family's executive game – a high-stakes poker tournament. He is a urologist who specializes in treating erectile dysfunction with penile implants. In 2002 Dr. Fried acted as the initial property buyer in Tony's HUD scam buying $500,000 worth of property with Soprano family money to buy several homes on Garside Street in Mount Pleasant, Newark, New Jersey and on Frelinghuysen Ave in Weequahic, Newark for $25,000 each which would then be falsely appraised at $200,000. He would then sell the properties on to Maurice Tiffen who would claim the project a financial failure and the loan would be approved through Maurice's organization. In 2004, Fried and numerous others were the victims of a large-scale car robbery at his daughter's wedding in Ringwood, New Jersey and sold them to a chop shop in Newburg, New York that worked with Johnny Sack instead of using Tony's connections in Brookdale, New Jersey. He reached out to Tony about the theft. It turned out that Feech La Manna had organized the car theft scheme. *Peter Bogdanovich as Dr. Elliot Kupferberg: he is Dr. Jennifer Melfi's psychiatrist who also used to be her teacher. Elliot tries to convince her numerous times to refer Tony to another colleague. Vin Makazian reveals to Tony when he is asked to put surveillance on her that she sees her own psychiatrist, Kupferberg, which surprises Tony. In the episode \\"Employee of the Month,\\" Elliot also counsels Melfi following her rape, while she inadvertently reveals to Kupferberg that the patient she is treating is Tony Soprano. Elliot once unknowingly encountered Tony Soprano in the parking garage at Columbia University, while both were visiting their daughters. In 2007, following Tony's shooting by Junior and the rise of his media profile, Melfi accuses Elliot of directing their therapy towards discussing \\"Patient Soprano\\" because of his desire for gossip and continuous shows of interest. In the episode \\"The Second Coming,\\" he tells Melfi of a study that concludes talk therapy enables sociopaths. In the episode \\"The Blue Comet,\\" he further presses Melfi about Soprano at a dinner party, where he reveals to guests that Soprano is Melfi's patient, to her embarrassment, a serious breach of doctor- patient confidentiality, although he dismisses her protests casually, saying everyone at the table is a professional. Melfi is upset, but nevertheless later reads the study herself, which leads her to finally drop Tony Soprano as a patient at their next session. *Matthew Sussman as Dr. Douglas Schreck: he is Junior Soprano's cardiologist at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, who allowed Junior to use his office to conduct meetings while under the pretense of coming in for medical appointments due to the physician-patient privilege clause that denies the FBI and authorities to listening in on their conversations, meeting with associates including Tony and Richie Aprile. *Michael Countryman as Dr. Richard Vogel: he is a psychotherapist whom A.J.'s pediatrician recommends to Carmela for therapy concerning A.J.'s depression. In the episode \\"The Second Coming,\\" Dr. Vogel also enters A.J. into a mental hospital and arranges a group therapy session with him and his parents after A.J. tries to commit suicide. *Will McCormack as Jason LaPenna: he is Jennifer Melfi and Richard LaPenna's son. *Richard Romanus as Richard LaPenna: he is the estranged Calabrese husband of Jennifer Melfi and father of Jason LaPenna. When Dr. Melfi's family learn that she is treating a major mob figure, they urge her to end the association. Richard is a member of an organization that aims to combat the negative portrayal of Italian Americans as Mafia figures in the media. Richard and Jennifer had reconciled in 2001 and he was living with her at the time of her rape. He originally thinks Jennifer's rapist is Puerto-Rican based on her description, but later finds out that he bears an Italian surname (Rossi) and is personally offended. He was very angry when mishandling of the chain of custody allowed the man to go free. *Cara Buono as Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti: she was Christopher Moltisanti's new girlfriend in 2006. She became pregnant and planned to terminate the pregnancy, blaming herself for the lack of contraception. When she told Chris, he suggests they marry in Atlantic City. Soon after their marriage, Kelli and Chris bought a large new home. Christopher's interest in Kelli began to drift and he began an affair with Julianna Skiff while his wife was still pregnant. Kelli remained devoted to Christopher and did not complain about his long absences. In 2007, Kelli gave birth to her and Christopher's daughter, Caitlyn. She and Christopher later attended Caitlyn's baptism when Tony and Carmela Soprano became Caitlin's godparents. In the episode \\"Walk Like a Man,\\" Kelli was terrorized by Paulie Gualtieri when he drove his Cadillac CTS through their front yard in retaliation for Christopher throwing Paulie's nephew Little Paulie Germani out of a window. Little Paulie had stolen merchandise from Kelli's father's hardware store on at least two occasions. In the episode \\"Kennedy and Heidi,\\" when Christopher was badly injured in a car accident, and was suffocated by Tony, unknown to her. ==See also== *List of The Sopranos episodes *Soprano family *Lupertazzi family ==References== ==Notes== ==External links== * The Sopranos Cast and Crew from HBO.com ","title":"List of The Sopranos characters"},{"id":"515811","text":"Montsoreau Flea Market, Loire Valley, France The Market NYC, an artists, designers, vintage and an indoor flea market in New York CityA flea market (or swap meet) is a type of street market that provides space for vendors to sell previously-owned (second-hand) merchandise. This type of market is often seasonal. However, in recent years there has been the development of 'formal' and 'casual' markets which divides a fixed-style market (formal) with long- term leases and a seasonal-style market with short-term leases. Consistently, there tends to be an emphasis on sustainable consumption whereby items such as used goods, collectibles, antiques and vintage clothing can be purchased. Flea market vending is distinguished from street vending in that the market alone, and not any other public attraction, brings in buyers. There are a variety of vendors: some part-time who consider their work at flea markets a hobby due to their possession of an alternative job; full-time vendors who dedicate all their time to their stalls and collection of merchandise and rely solely on the profits made at the market. Vendors require skill in following retro and vintage trends, as well as selecting merchandise which connects with the culture and identity of their customers. In the United States, the National Association of Flea Markets was established in 1997, which provides various resources for sellers, suppliers and buyers and also provides a means for suppliers and sellers to communicate and form affiliations. ==Regional names== In the United States, an outdoor swap meet is the equivalent of a flea market. However, an indoor swap meet is the equivalent of a bazaar, a permanent, indoor shopping center open during normal retail hours, with fixed booths or storefronts for the vendors.https://lasvegassun.com/news/2019/feb/28/las- vegas-epic-second-hand-shops-antique-stores- an/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1992-07-08-mn-1515-story.htmlhttps://www.reviewjournal.com/business/young- businesses-thrive-in-indoor-swap-meets/ Different English-speaking countries use various names for flea markets. In Australian English, they are also called 'trash and treasure markets'. In Philippine English, the word is tianggê from the word tianguis via Mexican Spanish coming from Nahuatl. Despite common misconception, it is not derived from Hokkien. The word supplants the indigenous term talipapâ. In India, it is known as gurjari or shrukawadi bazaar or even as juna bazaar in Pune. In the United Kingdom, they are known as car boot sales if the event takes place in a field or car park, as the vendors will sell goods from the boot (or 'trunk' in American English) of their car. If the event is held indoors, such as a school or church hall, then it is usually known as either a jumble sale, or a bring and buy sale. In Quebec and France, they are often called Marché aux puces (literally \\"flea market\\"), while in French-speaking areas of Belgium, the name brocante or vide-grenier is normally used. In German, there are many words in use but the most common word is \\"Flohmarkt\\", meaning literally \\"flea market\\". The same applies to Swedish \\"loppmarknad\\" and Finnish \\"kirpputori\\". In the predominantly Cuban/Hispanic areas of South Florida, they are called [el] pulguero (\\"[the] flea store\\") from pulga, the Spanish word for fleas. In the Southern part of Andalusia, due to the influence of Gibraltar English, they are known as \\"piojito\\", which means \\"little louse\\". In Chile they can be called persas or mercados persa (\\"persian market\\") and ferias libres, if mostly selling fruit and vegetables. In Argentina are most likely called \\"feria artesanal\\" (artisan's or street fair) or \\"feria americana\\" (American fair), the latter name is due to have taken the idea from their United States counterpart. ==Etymology== Troedelladen (fleashop) by , 1926 While the concept existed in places such as what are now India, Bangladesh, and China for millennia, the origins of the term \\"flea market\\" are disputed. According to one theory, the Fly Market in 18th-century New York City, located at Maiden Lane near the East River in Manhattan began the association. The land on which the market took place was originally a salt marsh with a brook, and by the early 1800s the \\"Fly Market\\" was the city's principal market.Google Books: The geographical and historical dictionary of America and the West ..., Volume 3, by Antonio de Alcedo and George Alexander Thompson, p. 409, 1812 A second theory maintains that \\"flea market\\" is a common English calque from the French \\"marché aux puces\\" which literally translates to \\"market of the fleas\\", labelled as such because the items sold were previously owned and worn, supposedly containing fleas. The first reference to this term appeared in two conflicting stories about a location in Paris in the 1860s which was known as the \\"marché aux puces\\". The traditional and most-publicized story is in the article \\"What Is a Flea Market?\\" by Albert LaFarge in the 1998 winter edition of Today's Flea Market magazine: \\"There is a general agreement that the term 'Flea Market' is a literal translation of the French marché aux puces, an outdoor bazaar in Paris, France, named after those pesky little parasites of the order Siphonaptera (or \\"wingless bloodsucker\\") that infested the upholstery of old furniture brought out for sale.\\" The second story appeared in the book Flea Markets, published in Europe by Chartwell Books, has in its introduction: There are flea markets in Japan. However, because the words \\"flea\\" and \\"free\\" are transcribed in the same Japanese katakana phonetic letters, they have mistaken them and started to use \\"free market\\" instead of \\"flea market\\" (Cf. the website of the Japanese Free Market Association).Free Market. freemarket-go.com.

He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\" by Labelle. ==BiographyEarly life and career=== The youngest of three children, Toussaint was born in 1938 in New Orleans and grew up in a shotgun house in the Gert Town neighborhood, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. His father, Clarence, worked on the railway and played trumpet.

Retrieved November 13, 2015. After a lucky break at age 17, in which he stood in for Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith at a performance with Earl King's band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians led by Dave Bartholomew, who performed regularly at the Dew Drop Inn, a nightclub on Lasalle Street in Uptown New Orleans.Fensterstock, Alison. \\"On Top of the Charts: Allen Toussaint Is As Sharp and Prolific As Ever\\". Gambit Weekly (New Orleans), May 1, 2007. p. 23. Archives online at Bestofneworleans.com. His first recording was in 1957 as a stand-in for Fats Domino on Domino's record \\"I Want You to Know\\", on which Toussaint played piano and Domino overdubbed his vocals. His first success as a producer came in 1957 with Lee Allen's \\"Walking with Mr. Lee\\". He began performing regularly in Bartholomew's band, and he recorded with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Lee Allen and other leading New Orleans performers. After being spotted as a sideman by the A&R; man Danny Kessler, he initially recorded for RCA Records as Al Tousan. In early 1958 he recorded an album of instrumentals, The Wild Sound of New Orleans, with a band including Alvin \\"Red\\" Tyler (baritone sax), either Nat Perrilliat or Lee Allen (tenor sax), either Justin Adams or Roy Montrell (guitar), Frank Fields (bass), and Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams (drums).Planer, Lindsay.

He did freelance work for other labels, such as Fury. Toussaint played piano, wrote, arranged and produced a string of hits in the early and mid-1960s for New Orleans R&B; artists such as Ernie K-Doe, Chris Kenner, Irma Thomas (including \\"It's Raining\\"), Art and Aaron Neville, The Showmen, and Lee Dorsey, whose first hit \\"Ya Ya\\" he produced in 1961. The early to mid-1960s are regarded as Toussaint's most creatively successful period. Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill's \\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\\" (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe's \\"Mother-in-Law\\", and Chris Kenner's \\"I Like It Like That\\". A two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised \\"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\\" (covered by The O'Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton) and the simple but effective \\"Fortune Teller\\" (covered by various 1960s rock groups, including The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, The Who, The Hollies, The Throb, and ex-The Searchers founder Tony Jackson). \\"Ruler of My Heart\\", written under his pseudonym Naomi Neville, first recorded by Irma Thomas for the Minit label in 1963, was adapted by Otis Redding under the title \\"Pain in My Heart\\" later that year, prompting Toussaint to file a lawsuit against Redding and his record company, Stax (the claim was settled out of court, with Stax agreeing to credit Naomi Neville as the songwriter).Bowman, Rob. (1997). Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records. New York, Schirmer Trade Books. p. 46, note 16. Redding's version of the song was also recorded by The Rolling Stones on their second album.

Sansu: Soul and early New Orleans funk Toussaint was drafted into the United States Army in 1963 but continued to record when on leave. After his discharge in 1965, he joined forces with Marshall Sehorn to form Sansu Enterprises, which included a record label, Sansu, variously known as Tou-Sea, Deesu, or Kansu, and recorded Lee Dorsey, Chris Kenner, Betty Harris, and others. Dorsey had hits with several of Toussaint's songs, including \\"Ride Your Pony\\" (1965), \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\" (1966), and \\"Holy Cow\\" (1966). The core players of the rhythm section used on many of the Sansu recordings from the mid- to late 1960s, Art Neville and the Sounds, consisted of Art Neville on keyboards, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, George Porter Jr on bass, and Zigaboo Modeliste on drums. They later became known as The Meters. Their backing can be heard in songs such as Dorsey's \\"Ride Your Pony\\" and \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", sometimes augmented by horns, which were usually arranged by Toussaint. The Toussaint-produced records of these years backed by the members of the Meters, with their increasing use of syncopation and electric instrumentation, built on the influences of Professor Longhair and others before them, but updated these strands, effectively paving the way for the development of a modern New Orleans funk sound. Stewart, Alexander (2000). \\"Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music.\\" Popular Music, v. 19, no. 3 (Oct. 2000), p. 297, quoting Dr. John quoted describing Professor Longhair's influence on New Orleans funk. ===1970s to 1990s=== Toussaint continued to produce The Meters when they began releasing records under their own name in 1969. As part of a process begun at Sansu and reaching fruition in the 1970s, he developed a funkier sound, writing and producing for a host of artists, such as Dr. John (backed by the Meters, on the 1973 album In the Right Place, which contained the hit \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\") and an album by The Wild Tchoupitoulas, a New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians tribe led by \\"Big Chief Jolly\\" (George Landry) (backed by the Meters and several of his nephews, including Art and Cyril Neville of the Meters and their brothers Charles and Aaron, who later performed and recorded as The Neville Brothers). In the 1970s Toussaint began to work with artists from beyond New Orleans artists, such as B. J. Thomas, Robert Palmer, Willy DeVille, Sandy Denny, Elkie Brooks, Solomon Burke, Scottish soul singer Frankie Miller (High Life), and southern rocker Mylon LeFevre. He arranged horn music for The Band's albums Cahoots (1971) and Rock of Ages (1972) and for the documentary film The Last Waltz (1978). Boz Scaggs recorded Toussaint's \\"What Do You Want the Girl to Do?\\" on his 1976 album Silk Degrees, which reached number 2 on the U.S. pop albums chart. The song was also recorded by Bonnie Raitt for her 1975 album Home Plate and by Geoff Muldaur (1976), Lowell George (1979), Vince Gill (1993), and Elvis Costello (2005). In 1976 he collaborated with John Mayall on the album Notice to Appear. In 1973 Toussaint and Sehorn created the Sea-Saint recording studio in the Gentilly section of eastern New Orleans.Alison Fensterstock, op. cit.Jaffe, Ben, Allen Toussaint profile , preshallben.tumblr.com, October 2, 2014. Toussaint began recording under his own name, contributing vocals as well as piano. His solo career peaked in the mid-1970s with the albums From a Whisper to a Scream and Southern Nights. During this time he teamed with Labelle and produced their acclaimed 1975 album Nightbirds, which contained the number one hit \\"Lady Marmalade\\". The same year, Toussaint collaborated with Paul McCartney and Wings for their hit album Venus and Mars and played on the song \\"Rock Show\\". In 1973, his \\"Yes We Can Can\\" was covered by The Pointer Sisters for their self-titled debut album; released as a single, it became both a pop and R&B; hit and served as the group's introduction to popular culture. Two years later, Glen Campbell covered Toussaint's \\"Southern Nights\\" and carried the song to number one on the pop, country and adult contemporary charts. In 1987, he was the musical director of an off-Broadway show, Staggerlee, which ran for 150 performances. Like many of his contemporaries, Toussaint found that interest in his compositions was rekindled when his work began to be sampled by hip hop artists in the 1980s and 1990s. ===2000s=== Toussaint performing in Stockholm in 2009 Most of Toussaint's possessions, including his home and recording studio, Sea-Saint Studios, were lost during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He initially sought shelter at the Astor Crowne Plaza Hotel on Canal Street. Following the hurricane, whose aftermath left most of the city flooded, he left New Orleans for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and for several years settled in New York City. His first television appearance after the hurricane was on the September 7, 2005, episode of the Late Show with David Letterman, sitting in with Paul Shaffer and his CBS Orchestra. Toussaint performed regularly at Joe's Pub in New York City through 2009. He eventually returned to New Orleans and lived there for the rest of his life. The River in Reverse, Toussaint's collaborative album with Elvis Costello, was released on May 29, 2006, in the UK on Verve Records by Universal Classics and Jazz UCJ. It was recorded in Hollywood and at the Piety Street Studio in the Bywater section Toussaint's native New Orleans, as the first major studio session to take place after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, Toussaint performed a duet with Paul McCartney of a song by New Orleans musician and resident Fats Domino, \\"I Want to Walk You Home\\", as their contribution to Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard Records). In 2008, Toussaint's song \\"Sweet Touch of Love\\" was used in a deodorant commercial for the Axe (Lynx) brand. The commercial won a Gold Lion at the 2008 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. In February 2008, Toussaint appeared on Le Show, the Harry Shearer show broadcast on KCRW. He appeared in London in August 2008, where he performed at the Roundhouse. In October 2008 he performed at Festival New Orleans at The O2 alongside acts such as Dr. John and Buckwheat Zydeco. Sponsored by Quint Davis of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Philip Anschutz, the event was intended to promote New Orleans music and culture and to revive the once lucrative tourist trade that had been almost completely lost following the flooding that came with Hurricane Katrina. After his second performance at the festival, Toussaint appeared alongside Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu. Toussaint performed instrumentals from his album The Bright Mississippi and many of his older songs for a taping of the PBS series Austin City Limits, which aired on January 9, 2015. In December 2009, he was featured on Elvis Costello's Spectacle program on the Sundance Channel, singing \\"A Certain Girl\\". Toussaint appeared on Eric Clapton's 2010 album, Clapton, in two Fats Waller covers, \\"My Very Good Friend the Milkman\\" and \\"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful\\". His late-blooming career as a performer began when he accepted an offer to play a regular Sunday brunch session at an East Village pub. Interviewed in 2014 by The Guardians Richard Williams, Toussaint said, \\"I never thought of myself as a performer.... My comfort zone is behind the scenes.\\" In 2013 he collaborated on a ballet with the choreographer Twyla Tharp. Toussaint was a musical mentor to Swedish-born New Orleans songwriter and performer Theresa Andersson. ==Honors== Allen Toussaint receiving the National Medal of Arts in 2013 Toussaint was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2009, the Songwriter's Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2013 he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. In 2016, he posthumously won the Pinetop Perkins Piano Player title at the Blues Music Awards. ==Death== Toussaint died in the early hours of November 10, 2015, in Madrid, Spain, while on tour. Following a concert at the Teatro Lara on Calle Corredera Baja de San Pablo, he had a heart attack at his hotel and was pronounced dead on his arrival at hospital. He was 77. He had been due to perform a sold-out concert at the EFG London Jazz Festival at The Barbican on November 15 with his band and Theo Croker. He was also scheduled to play with Paul Simon at a benefit concert in New Orleans on 8 December. His final recording, American Tunes, titled after the Paul Simon song, which he sings on the album, was released by Nonesuch Records on June 10, 2016. Toussaint's one marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his three children, Clarence (better known as Reginald), Naomi, and Alison, and several grandchildren. His children had managed his career in his last years.Dominic Massa, \\"Influential songwriter, producer Allen Toussaint has died\\" , WWL-TV, November 10, 2015. Writing in The New York Times, Ben Sisario quoted Quint Davis, producer of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival: \\"In the pantheon of New Orleans music people, from Jelly Roll Morton to Mahalia Jackson to Fats—that's the place where Allen Toussaint is in\\". Paul Simon said, \\"We were friends and colleagues for almost 40 years.... We played together at the New Orleans jazz festival. We played the benefits for Katrina relief. We were about to perform together on December 8. I was just beginning to think about it; now I'll have to think about his memorial. I am so sad.\\" The Daily Telegraph described Toussaint as \\"a master of New Orleans soul and R&B;, and one of America's most successful songwriters and producers\\", adding that \\"self-effacing Toussaint played a crucial role in countless classic songs popularised by other artists\\". He had written so many songs, over more than five decades, that he admitted to forgetting quite a few. == Discography == *The Wild Sound of New Orleans (1958) *Toussaint (1971, aka From A Whisper To A Scream) *Life, Love and Faith (1972) *Southern Nights (1975) *Motion (1978) *I Love A Carnival Ball, Mr Mardi Gras Starring Allen Toussaint (1987) *Connected (1996) *A New Orleans Christmas (1997) *Allen Toussaint's Jazzity Project: Going Places (2004) *The Bright Mississippi (2009) *American Tunes (2016) ==References== ==External links== * *Allen Toussaint profile, NPR.org; accessed October 5, 2014. *Allen Toussaint profile, discogs.com; accessed October 5, 2014. *[ Allen Toussaint profile], allmusic.com; accessed October 5, 2014. *Allen Toussaint NYNO Records profile, nynorecords.com; accessed October 5, 2014. *List of chart records written by Toussaint, MusicVF.com, accessed November 11, 2015 *Allen Toussaint profile, preshallben.tumblr.com, October 5, 2014. * *Allen Toussaint speaks about songwriting and creating music NAMM Oral History Interview (2015) *A Conversation with Allen Toussaint (interviewer: Larry Appelbaum), November 1, 2007; from The Library of Congress (Video, Captions, Transcript) Category:1938 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Rhythm and blues musicians from New Orleans Category:African-American musicians Category:American people of French descent Category:American jazz pianists Category:Record producers from Louisiana Category:American soul musicians Category:Bell Records artists Category:Nonesuch Records artists Category:Reprise Records artists Category:Songwriters from Louisiana Category:American rhythm and blues keyboardists Category:American blues pianists Category:American male pianists Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients Category:20th-century American pianists Category:21st-century American pianists Category:Jazz musicians from New Orleans Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Allen Toussaint"},{"id":"515818","text":"Hal Blaine (born Harold Simon Belsky; February 5, 1929 – March 11, 2019) was an American drummer and session musician, estimated to be among the most recorded studio drummers in the history of the music industry, claiming over 35,000 sessions and 6,000 singles. His drumming is featured on 150 US top 10 hits, 40 of which went to number one, as well as many film and television soundtracks. Born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Blaine moved with his family to California in 1943 and subsequently began playing jazz and big band music before taking up rock and roll session work. He became one of the regular players in Phil Spector's de facto house band, which Blaine nicknamed \\"the Wrecking Crew\\". Some of the records Blaine played on include the Ronettes' single \\"Be My Baby\\" (1963), which contained a drum beat that became widely imitated, as well as works by popular artists such as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, the Carpenters, Neil Diamond, and the Byrds. Blaine's workload declined from the 1980s onwards as recording and musical practices changed. In 2000, he was among the inaugural \\"sidemen\\" inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2018 he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ==Life and career== Blaine was born Harold Simon Belsky to Jewish Eastern European immigrants, Meyer and Rose Belsky (née Silverman), in Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States. When he was seven, he moved with his family to Hartford, Connecticut. He began playing drums at the age of eight, and again moved with his family to California in 1943. From 1949 to 1952, Blaine learned drums from Roy Knapp, who had also taught jazz drummer Gene Krupa. He began his professional career playing overnight sessions in Chicago strip clubs, which allowed him to practice and perfect his sight reading skills. He subsequently played as part of Count Basie's big band and toured with Patti Page and Tommy Sands before taking up session work. Unlike many of his jazz contemporaries, Blaine enjoyed playing rock and roll and this meant he played on numerous such sessions during the 1950s. He was a core member of the Wrecking Crew, the close-knit group of Los Angeles session musicians that played on hit records during the 1960s. Blaine claimed to have invented the name as the \\"old-school\\" studio musicians feared these new, younger guys were a \\"destructive force\\" in the conservative studio environment of the time. Blaine played less session work from the 1980s onwards as computers and electronics began to be used in studios, and producers began to bring in younger players. The popularisation of the drum machine also reduced demand for session drummers like Blaine. He kept busy recording advertising jingles for a number of years, before semi-retiring from performing. Most of his wealth was lost following his divorce. At one point, he was working as a security guard in Arizona. ==Death== Blaine died of natural causes on March 11, 2019, at the age of 90 in Palm Desert, California. A statement from his family read \\"May he rest forever on 2 and 4\\", referring to the second and fourth beats of a measure in music. Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson expressed public condolences and praised Blaine's musicianship. Ronnie Spector praised Blaine for \\"the magic he put on all our Ronettes recordings\\". ==Legacy and recognition== Blaine was a prolific session player and by his estimation played on over 35,000 recordings, including 6,000 singles. He is widely regarded as one of the most in-demand drummers in rock and roll history, having \\"certainly played on more hit records than any drummer in the rock era\\". His drumming can be heard as part of the Wall of Sound on the Ronettes' 1963 single \\"Be My Baby\\", produced by Phil Spector at Hollywood's Gold Star Studios. Drummer Max Weinberg wrote, \\"If Hal Blaine had played drums only on ... 'Be My Baby', his name would still be uttered with reverence and respect for the power of his big beat.\\" The pattern was created when Blaine accidentally hit the snare on just the fourth beat, instead of the two and four. It was a mistake that Spector decided to leave in. Blaine is also credited with popularising the \\"disco beat\\" after he recorded a \\"pshh- shup\\" sound by opening and closing the hi-hat at appropriate intervals on Johnny Rivers' \\"Poor Side of Town\\". The effect had been widely used in jazz, but professional recording engineers disliked it because of its resemblance to white noise. The sound subsequently became sought-after by producers in the 1970s. Stamp used by Blaine \\"Hal Blaine Strikes Again\\" was a rubber stamp used by Blaine to mark music scores and places where he played. When asked to explain about the stamp, Blaine said, \\"I always stamp my charts. And there's a reason why I started that; it wasn't all ego.\\" The stamp was used for any piece of music Blaine played on. Another drummer, Mike Botts, then with the band Bread, recalled: \\"Every studio I went to in the late sixties, there was a rubber stamp imprint on the wall of the drum booth that said, 'Hal Blaine strikes again.' Hal was getting so many studio dates he actually had a rubber stamp made. He was everywhere!\\" In 2014, Blaine was portrayed by Johnny Sneed in the film Love & Mercy, a biopic of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Hal Blaine among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ===Awards and accolades=== Blaine played on six consecutive Grammy Award Record of the Year winners: *Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass in 1966 for \\"A Taste of Honey\\" *Frank Sinatra in 1967 for \\"Strangers in the Night\\" *The 5th Dimension in 1968 for \\"Up, Up and Away\\" *Simon & Garfunkel in 1969 \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" *The 5th Dimension in 1970 for \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\" *Simon & Garfunkel in 1971 for \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" In March 2000, Blaine was one of the first five sidemen inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (one of the other inductees was his long-time friend and drumming colleague Earl Palmer). He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2018, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ===Selected performances=== In addition to playing on 150 US top 10 singles, Blaine played drums on 39 recordings that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

Usually referred to as Tony, the Italian- American character was conceived by The Sopranos creator and showrunner David Chase, who was also largely responsible for the character's story arc throughout the show's six seasons. Gandolfini was ultimately cast in the role ahead of several other actors including Steven Van Zandt and Michael Rispoli. The character is loosely based on real-life New Jersey mobster Vincent \\"Vinny Ocean\\" Palermo, a former caporegime (capo) and \\"de facto\\" boss of the DeCavalcante crime family. Bobby Boriello and Mark Damiano II portrayed Soprano as a child in one episode each; Danny Petrillo played the character as a teenager in three episodes. In the first season, Tony is a capo in the DiMeo crime family. Between the first and second seasons, he is promoted to street boss, a position he retains until the sixth season; his uncle Corrado \\"Junior\\" Soprano is the official boss up until early in the sixth season but has little or no actual power. Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting needs of his actual familywife Carmela, daughter Meadow, son A. J., and mother Liviawith those of the Mafia family he controls. He often displays behavior traits characteristic of a violent sociopath, struggles with depression and is prone to panic attacks. He seeks treatment from Dr. Jennifer Melfi, a character Chase modeled after his own psychiatrist, in the first episode and remains in therapy on and off up until the penultimate episode of the series. Both the Tony Soprano character and Gandolfini's performance garnered widespread critical acclaim, with Soprano being often cited as one of the greatest and most influential characters in television history. Gandolfini, for his portrayal of the character, won three Emmy Awards for Best Lead Actor in a Drama Series, three Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Male Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama as well as two additional SAG Awards for Best Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. ==Casting== James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance, ultimately receiving the role ahead of several other actors due to his large stature and acting capability. Anthony LaPaglia was interested in the role but due to his Broadway production and the decision not to go with Fox, he was not further considered. Series creator David Chase invited Steven Van Zandt, who was a guitarist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, to audition for the role of Tony Soprano. Van Zandt, who had never acted before, felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, so Chase wrote him into a part that did not exist—as Silvio Dante. Michael Rispoli, who played Jackie Aprile Sr., the ailing mob boss of the DiMeo family in the first four episodes of the series, was also very close to being cast as Tony Soprano. In the pilot, Tony was named Tommy—an homage to the character played by James Cagney in The Public Enemy, Tom Powers, but the clearance on naming the character Tom was never given. ==Fictional character biography Early life === Tony Soprano was born in 1959, to Livia and Johnny Soprano. His father was a capo in the DiMeo crime family. He grew up living with his parents and two sisters, Janice and Barbara, in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. Tony's paternal grandfather, Corrado Soprano Sr., was from Ariano in the Province of Avellino who immigrated to the United States in 1911; he was a master stonemason who helped to build a church in Tony's old neighborhood. In adulthood, Tony recalls how Johnny used Janice as a cover for attending meetings with criminal associates at a children's amusement park, leading him to assume she was his father's favorite child. In therapy, when asked to remember happy childhood memories about his mother, Tony struggles to come up with any; he later describes his mother as a cruel, joyless woman who wore his father down \\"to a little nub\\" and who seemed to delight in threatening her children. Tony has a troubled relationship with Janice, due to her flighty and impulsive nature, which leads to her constantly relying on him for financial and emotional support. Their bond is further complicated in adulthood when she murders her boyfriend, Richie Aprile, one of Tony's subordinates, for striking her during a domestic dispute, leading to her calling on Tony for assistance in disposing of his body. In high school, Tony met his future bride Carmela DeAngelis, and became friends with Artie Bucco and Davey Scatino. He was also close to his maternal cousin Tony Blundetto; their mutual relatives called them Tony-Uncle- Al and Tony-Uncle-Johnny (after their fathers) to tell them apart, although Tony and his friends would take to calling him \\"Tony B.\\" The two Tonys spent summers at the farm of their uncle Pat Blundetto, a former DiMeo soldato (soldier) allowed to retire from the Mafia due to chronic illness. When they were in their early twenties, Tony B was arrested for his part in a hijacking: Tony was supposed to join Tony B on the job but failed to appear because of a panic attack after an argument with his mother, which resulted in his blacking out and suffering a head injury. For years after, Tony claimed that he had sustained the injury during a mugging, a story he maintained to abate his survivor's guilt. As a young adult, he attended Seton Hall University for a semester and a half before dropping out to pursue a life of crime. Tony was part of an unofficial crew of young criminals consisting of Silvio Dante, Ralph Cifaretto, and Giacomo \\"Jackie\\" Aprile, Sr. He and Jackie gained notoriety in the DiMeo family by robbing a card game run by Feech La Manna; Ralph was left out of the plan due to debilitating pain from a venereal disease, leading to a lifelong animosity between the two. Under the tutelage of his father's friend Paulie \\"Walnuts\\" Gualtieri, he committed his first murder in 1982 at the age of 22, killing a small-time bookie named Willie Overall. Following the murder, Paulie would become Tony's mentor in the Mafia lifestyle, with Paulie eventually settling into a role as Tony's own capo. Johnny shepherded Tony through his ascendancy until his death in 1986 from emphysema. When he died, Johnny had risen to the level of capo of his crew, as had his older brother, Junior. Junior took over as Tony's mentor, with parental figures Salvatore \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero and Paulie passing their loyalty to Tony upon Johnny's death, while Silvio joined the crew. Tony became acting capo of his father's old crew, a position which eventually became permanent. By 1995, Jackie Aprile, Sr. became acting boss after Ercole \\"Eckley\\" DiMeo was sent to prison. The DiMeo family was prosperous under Jackie's rule until 1998 when he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. With Jackie in and out of the hospital, a power struggle develops between Tony and Junior. With Jackie's death in mid-1999, a succession crisis reaches a point where a war within the family appears imminent. However, Tony brings a quick end to the conflict by endorsing Junior the official boss of the family. Unbeknownst to Junior, Tony secretly strikes a deal with the rest of the family to be the true boss, allowing Junior to believe that he's in power and act as a distraction for the FBI. === Narrated killings committed by Tony Soprano === Tony personally committed eight murders in the show. Furthermore, as a Boss, he was responsible for the deaths of others killed on his orders. The eight known murders, all explicitly presented onscreen, were: * Willie Overall, shot and killed by Tony to \\"make his bones\\" (become a made man) (1982, in \\"Remember When\\"). * Fabian \\"Febby\\" Petrulio, strangled by Tony for ratting out members of Paulie and Pussy's crew and joining the witness protection program (1999, in \\"College\\"). * Chucky Signore, shot and killed by Tony for conspiring to kill him with Junior (1999, in \\"I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano\\"). * Matthew Bevilaqua, killed by Tony and Big Pussy for attempting to kill Christopher Moltisanti (Tony's protégé and cousin-in-law) (2000, in \\"From Where to Eternity\\"). * Salvatore \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero, executed by Tony, Silvio, and Paulie on a yacht, after they discovered that he was an FBI informant (2000, in \\"Funhouse\\"). * Ralph Cifaretto, choked/bludgeoned to death in a fight over Ralph's supposedly killing their prize-winning racehorse \\"Pie- O-My\\" for insurance money (2002, in \\"Whoever Did This\\"). Also, revenge for murdering the stripper Tracee from \\"University.\\" * Tony Blundetto, shot and killed by Tony with a shotgun for the unauthorized killings of Joe Peeps and Billy Leotardo, to spare him from being the subject of torture from Phil Leotardo in revenge for his brother's death, as well as spare his crew from the threat of retaliation (2004, in \\"All Due Respect\\"). * Christopher Moltisanti, suffocated by Tony, following a major car accident with Christopher as the driver and Tony as the passenger, Christopher revealed that he was still using drugs and was worried about going to the hospital (2007, in \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\"). It is made clear that some of these murders leave Tony perplexed as to how to cope with the situation; most notably, after murdering Christopher Moltisanti, he feels a rush of relief for finally being rid of an associate whom he feels he can no longer trust. He has to \\"show the sad face\\" while the rest of the family grieves, but Tony reassures himself that Moltisanti's murder was necessary, despite the hurt caused to the family. The murder of Fabian \\"Febby\\" Petrulio in \\"College\\" is out of retaliation for Febby getting members of Tony's crew sent to prison when he ratted them out to get immunity. Tony does this out of a feeling of justice since he has contempt for Febby getting away with it initially. The murder of Big Pussy in \\"Funhouse\\" weighs heavily on Tony. He is at first tempted to spare his old friend and even seems to be in denial for quite a long time, but in the end, realizes his priorities. In the years to follow, Tony talks about this with Paulie and Silvio, who also participated in the murder, and all three have had haunting dreams of the murder of their friend. Tony kills Ralph Cifaretto after their horse, Pie-O-My, dies amid suspicious circumstances in \\"Whoever Did This\\". Tony tries to confront Ralph about the situation but, after some heated words, Tony loses control and murders Ralph following a violent fight. Though no solid proof was found that the fire killing Pie-O-My was arson, Tony is convinced Ralph did it. It is also implied that this burst of rage could have been fueled by delayed revenge for Ralph's brutal murder of stripper Tracee, considering Tony uttered \\"She was a beautiful, innocent creature. What'd she ever do to you? You fucking killed her!\\" which could apply to both the female horse and the young woman. The murder of Matthew Bevilaqua is vengeance, an act that had to be carried out since the fact that Christopher was shot was a direct affront to him as Boss. Tony takes satisfaction in it, as it is revenge for an attempt on the life of one of his relatives. This murder was the closest Tony came to getting in trouble with the authorities, due to having been seen by a witness. In addition to the potential arrest, Tony was also uneasy about the murder due to Bevilaqua's young age and that his last words were \\"mommy\\". This inspires Tony to spend more quality time with his son. The murder of his cousin, Tony Blundetto (in \\"All Due Respect\\"), is solely to save him from a far worse death if he were to fall into Phil's hands, and so that Tony does not lose his reputation as a Boss (as well as sparing the other members of his crew from Phil's threats of retaliation, thus preserving their loyalty). The murder of his nephew, Christopher Moltisanti (in \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\") is not done out of mob-related necessity. Christopher had been addicted to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol for many years and had not conquered his addiction in rehab. While Moltisanti presents a threat to Tony's life and the New Jersey Mob, it is ultimately an emotional reaction. Tony is about to call 911 following a motor vehicle accident. Christopher, who needs urgent medical attention, tells him that he would \\"never pass the drug test\\" and would, therefore, lose his driver's license. He asks Tony to call for a taxi. Tony looks at the baby seat on the backseat of the SUV which had been destroyed by a tree branch, closes his phone, and suffocates Christopher by holding his nose shut so that he chokes to death on his blood. Tony does not plan to murder Christopher but sees the opportunity after the car accident. Tony is never suspected of this murder. === As a father === Tony lives in North Caldwell, New Jersey with his wife and two children: Meadow Soprano and Anthony (A.J.) Soprano. He also treats Christopher Moltisanti, his wife's first cousin once removed, as a son in many ways. Tony is often portrayed as a loving father—he attends his children's sporting events regularly and does all he can to ensure they have luxuries and opportunities. He hopes that both his children will escape the life of crime he has led. Tony takes great pride in Meadow's achievements. In Season 1, he is moved to tears by her performance at a choir recital. He often tells people about her aspiration to become a pediatrician. He also sometimes alienates his children with his behavior. He has always tried to conceal his criminal life from them—something that Meadow saw through early on and A.J. also realizes with guidance from his sister. Tony's over-protectiveness of Meadow leads to feuds between them on several occasions. For example, her first boyfriend at college is of Black and Jewish ancestry and Tony's dislike of him leads him to try to drive him away. Meadow learns of her father's actions and does not speak to him for several months, eventually reconciling at Christmas in 2001. Meadow's next boyfriend is Jackie Aprile Jr., the son of Tony's old friend, the late Jackie Aprile Sr. Tony had promised Jackie Jr.'s father that he would keep his son out of the Mafia life. Tony is initially pleased with the relationship, believing Jackie to be a hard-working pre-med student from a good family. However, since Jackie's uncle Richie Aprile's release from prison and subsequent death, Tony realizes that Jackie had become more involved in the Mafia when he sees him at strip clubs and a casino. He eventually beats Jackie up to warn him about abusing his daughter's feelings and confiscates his gun. Tony begins seeing much of himself and his treatment of Carmela in Jackie's relationship with Meadow. Jackie is killed by Vito for his involvement in a robbery at Christopher's and Furio's executive card game, and for shooting a made man, Furio. This drives Meadow to drink and depression, although they'd broken up shortly before his death. After Jackie's death, Tony accepts Meadow's college friends and gets along well with her fiancé, Finn, before the two separate under unrevealed circumstances. When Meadow is out for dinner with her \\"mystery\\" boyfriend Patrick Parisi, New York mob member Salvatore \\"Coco\\" Cogliano walks up to the table and makes drunk remarks about her looks and how \\"Tony must love tucking you in at night\\". After taking advice from her mother, Meadow tells Tony, who hides his rage and says Coco is \\"harmless\\" and \\"an idiot\\". Tony then tracks down Coco and Butch DeConcini at John's Restaurant on East 12th Street in Manhattan. Tony viciously pistol-whips Coco several times with a snubnosed revolver and warns Butch at gunpoint to shut up and remain seated at his table. After breaking off some of Coco's teeth with a curb stomp, Tony leaves the restaurant. Tony's feelings toward his son are mixed; he worries about his future. From the beginning, Tony has doubts that his son could succeed in the Mafia telling his therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi that \\"he'd never make it\\". His fears are confirmed as A.J. consistently demonstrates throughout the series that he lacks his father's cunning and dominating persona. Tony tells A.J. numerous times that he is proud that his son is gentle and kind. Tony is especially proud of A.J.'s prowess on the football field, even amid his failing grades in high school, but is frustrated with A.J.'s lack of focus after graduation. After flunking out of Ramapo State, A.J. loafs around the house, parties, and for a time holds a job at Blockbuster until his father gets him a job working construction. There, A.J. meets Blanca, and in Tony's opinion, A.J. does well until he and Blanca break up. Tony worries about A.J.'s depression, the \\"rotten putrid Soprano gene\\" that Tony believes he passed down to his son. Hoping to get A.J. back on track, Tony rekindles A.J.'s friendship with \\"the Jasons\\", sons of two of his associates, and A.J. seems to be doing better. With the help of a therapist and medication, A.J. is finally getting back to college, this time at Rutgers University, to take classes and party with girls as Tony believes every college kid should. This later turns sour after A.J. sees his new friends attack a Somalian student on a bike and he regresses into depression. A.J. tries to drown himself in a swimming pool but decides he wants to live; he is unable to escape the pool, however. Tony hears his cries for help and rescues him. After A.J. is released from a mental health ward, Tony and Carmela dissuade him from joining the Army and convince him instead to become involved in a film bankrolled by Carmine Lupertazzi Jr., with the possibility of opening a club. === Interests and hobbies === Tony is an avid animal lover and enjoys feeding the ducks which visit his pool. He has a sentimental attachment towards animals, as he had been traumatized by the loss of his childhood dog (as revealed in the episode \\"In Camelot\\"), whose name was \\"Tippy\\". When he goes to confront Angie Bonpensiero as she's walking her poodle, the dog greets Tony in a friendly manner, which Tony reciprocates. During Christopher Moltisanti's intervention, when Tony hears Christopher accidentally suffocated Adrianna's dog, he is furious, saying, \\"I oughta suffocate you, you little prick!\\" He becomes involved in horse racing through his friend Hesh Rabkin, who owns a stable, and invests in a racehorse named Pie-O-My. When his horse is killed in a fire – possibly set by Ralph Cifaretto – Tony is deeply upset and saddened and kills Cifaretto, yelling: \\"She was a beautiful innocent creature. What did she ever do to you?\\" He repeats \\"You fucking killed her!\\", while banging Cifaretto's head against the floor. When informed by Carmela that a black bear has been foraging in his home's backyard while they were separated, during Season 5, he reacts with interest, rather than fear. During his stay in the hospital after his shooting, he can be seen reading a book about dinosaurs, given by Carmela. In the series finale, Tony finds a stray cat at his safehouse during the war with New York and takes a liking to it. He brings it back to Satriale's, where it stares at the deceased Chris Moltisanti's photo (much to Paulie's dismay). Tony is seen many times throughout the show engaging in both freshwater and saltwater angling. His son Anthony Jr. sometimes accompanies him on fishing outings. During the second season, he presents his son with a Fenwick rod and a Penn International reel, both extremely high-quality products. In the sixth season, while in Florida with Paulie, he rents a sport fishing boat. He is sometimes haunted by visions of Pussy Bonpensiero incarnated in the form of a fish – presumably a reference to the disposal of his body in the ocean. A Big Mouth Billy Bass novelty singing fish, brought into the Bada Bing by Georgie and another later presented to him as a Christmas present by his daughter Meadow, recall his nightmare and disturb him greatly. Throughout the series, Tony is shown to be a frequent cigar smoker, as well as an occasional cigarette smoker. He can be seen smoking a cigar during important events, such as shortly before being told of his mother's death and when disposing of Ralph Cifaretto's corpse. in the Season 1 episode \\"A Hit Is a Hit\\", he gives his doctor and next-door-neighbor Bruce Cusamano a box of Cuban cigars as a thank-you present for referring him to Dr. Melfi. He is also a gun enthusiast and is shown to have an arsenal in his home. He gives guns as birthday gifts to his father-in-law Hugh DeAngelis (in \\"Marco Polo\\") and receives one from Bobby Baccialieri on his birthday (in \\"Soprano Home Movies\\"). Tony enjoys sports, particularly baseball, football, basketball, golf, and horse racing. He played baseball and football at West Essex High School, and is a fan of the New York Yankees and New York Jets. He has taken A.J. to New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils games occasionally throughout the series. Some objects and posters in A.J.'s room confirm this. He plays golf with Johnny Sack at Upper Montclair Country Club. A large portion of his income is derived from illegal sports betting. Tony is an amateur yachtsman and has owned two motor yachts throughout the show: Stugots and Stugots II, where several of his affairs take place. The name comes from the Southern Italian phrase sto cazzo, literally meaning \\"this dick\\" or \\"my dick\\", and depending on the context, \\"what the fuck\\" or \\"my ass\\". Tony maintains an avid interest in history, particularly World War II. Throughout seasons 4 and 5, Tony is seen watching Vietnam War documentaries. He is a big fan of President John F. Kennedy and owns one of his captain sailor hats, which he won at an auction. He is often shown watching programs on the History Channel about great leaders such as George S. Patton, Erwin Rommel, and Winston Churchill. He reads The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which is quoted by several other characters on the show, particularly Paulie Walnuts. Tony is often seen watching classic mob films. For example, he is shown watching The Public Enemy (1931) throughout the episode \\"Proshai, Livushka\\", which addresses his mother's death. He also shares a love for The Godfather series (wondering what went wrong in the third installment). Tony listens to classic, progressive rock and pop music, particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Over the course of the show he is seen to enjoy AC/DC, Deep Purple, Eagles, Eric Clapton, Jefferson Airplane, Jethro Tull, Journey, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Pink Floyd, Rush, Steely Dan, The Clash, The Chi-Lites, The Lost Boys, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and Van Morrison. ===Vehicles=== Like most of the mobsters in the series, Tony is shown to be partial to Cadillac and Lincoln vehicles. When discussing with Dr. Melfi a bizarre dream in which his penis falls off, he mentions that he went to the guy who used to \\"work on my Lincoln when I drove Lincolns\\". For the first four seasons, Tony drives a burgundy 1999 Chevrolet Suburban LT 4x4, but in season 5, this has been replaced with a black Cadillac Escalade ESV. This black Escalade is totaled in an accident and quickly replaced with a white Escalade ESV. Tony has this Escalade until the end of the series. === Extramarital affairs === Throughout the series, Tony is shown to be a serial adulterer. He typically has mistresses whom he consistently sees for long periods, though he also has several brief one-night stands with strippers from the Bada Bing. His wife Carmela is tacitly aware of his infidelity and usually views it as a form of masturbation, though sometimes the bottled-up tensions explode in domestic arguments. At the end of Season 4, Irina telephones Carmela in a jealous rage at Tony's cheating on her with her cousin Svetlana, which causes Carmela to finally snap. Carmela throws Tony out of the house and begins divorce proceedings. Tony has a strong preference for women of European, particularly Italian descent, with dark hair and eyes and exotic features. His mistresses have been, in chronological order, of Russian (Irina and later Svetlana), Italian (Gloria Trillo), Italian-Cuban (Valentina La Paz), and Jewish descent (Julianna Skiff). He favors dark features but also has a few brief flings with blonde American European women, including a stewardess from Icelandic Airways and a medical assistant. He has one very short encounter with an Asian-American escort during \\"The Test Dream\\". Mistresses: * Irina Peltsin – a young Russian woman whom he sees consistently throughout the first two seasons. She frequently calls Tony's house when drunk, and when Carmela hints that she knows that he is seeing her, he breaks off the relationship. After her suicide attempt, Tony sends Silvio to give her a monetary compensation of $75,000 and try to reason her into moving on with her life. * Gloria Trillo – an Italian-American Mercedes-Benz saleswoman with stylish tastes. Tony dates her throughout Season 3 after meeting her at Dr. Melfi's office (Dr. Melfi repeatedly expresses her disapproval of their relationship, knowing it will likely turn out a disaster). He eventually stops seeing her when she begins stalking him and calling his house, while exhibiting manipulative behaviours reminding him of his own mother (which is foreshadowed very early on when she teases him by saying \\"poor you\\", jokingly at first). He also understands through Dr. Melfi's hints that Gloria is trying to use him as a means to commit suicide (akin to the suicide by cop phenomenon). Tony asks Patsy Parisi to threaten her (Parisi tells her that, if she tries again to harass Tony, the last face she'll see will be his, not Tony's, and that \\"it won't be cinematic\\"). It turns out that it throws her over the edge as she commits suicide soon afterwards, hanging herself. This greatly upsets Tony, who blames it on himself as well as Dr. Melfi. * Valentina La Paz – a beautiful art dealer of Italian and Cuban descent, initially the mistress of Ralph Cifaretto. Tony dates her throughout Season 4. They share a love of horses, and she visits Pie-O-My at the stable with Tony. She accidentally sets her robe on fire in Season 5 while cooking eggs for Tony. Shortly thereafter he decides to get back together with Carmela, and he breaks up with Valentina while she is in the hospital recovering from second- degree burns to her head, face, and arm. Tony offers to take care of any cost related to her treatment, but their relationship ends on bad terms. * Svetlana Kirilenko – the maternal cousin of Tony's ex-comàre Irina and the manager of a home care nursing business. During her childhood, Svetlana developed an osteosarcoma in her leg which was amputated soon afterwards. Tony comments that she looks like the actress Greta Garbo. She was first hired as Livia Soprano's nurse since Janice had left town. Svetlana resurfaces as Uncle Junior's nurse after he suffers a fall at the courthouse. One afternoon while Uncle Junior is asleep, Tony has sex with Svetlana on Junior's sofa but they are caught by Junior's nurse, Branca. Irina soon finds out about this and informs Carmela about the affair, prompting Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their ultimate separation. Svetlana later tells Tony that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana's withholding Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and other taxes from her paycheck. Tony admires Svetlana for her toughness of spirit and her refusal to allow her disability and misfortune to get in the way of her ambitions. Arguably, Svetlana is the most psychologically balanced of all Tony's extramarital affairs. * Julianna Skiff – a real estate developer of Jewish descent. She meets Tony in Season 6 when offering to buy a building that he owns, to be converted into a Jamba Juice. They later begin an affair, along with a business relationship, but never consummate their relationship sexually; Tony backs off and decides to be faithful to Carmela, who stuck with him after the shooting and seems re-devoted to him. Julianna eventually dates Christopher Moltisanti and the two begin a very destructive, co-dependent drug habit; she is last seen attending Christopher's funeral service, where she mentions that they had split up. === Therapy === Tony has suffered from panic attacks that sometimes cause him to lose consciousness since his childhood. He has his first on-screen panic attack while cooking sausages at his son's birthday party—this occurs in a flashback in the pilot episode. Tony loses consciousness and causes a small explosion when he drops a bottle of lighter fluid onto the coals. Tony describes the experience of the panic attack as feeling like he had \\"ginger ale in his skull\\". This prompts him to seek help for the attacks. After extensive testing that includes an MRI scan and blood work, no physical cause can be found, so Dr. Cusamano refers Tony to psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Tony's therapy allows a discussion of his thoughts and feelings away from both aspects of his life—this forum for reaching into the character's thoughts has been described as a Greek chorus, and as a key for viewers to understand the character.William Bender, \\"The Last Aria of Tony Soprano\\", The New York Times, February 26, 2006 Tony is initially very resistant to the idea that there was a psychiatric cause for his symptoms. He resents being in therapy and refuses to accept the diagnosis of panic attacks given him by the neurologists who had investigated his illness. Tony begins to open up once Dr. Melfi explains the doctor-patient confidentiality rules. He tells her about the stress of his business life—he has a feeling that he has come in at the end of something and describes a reverence for the glorified \\"old days\\" of the Mafia. Tony leaves out the violence associated with his criminal career. Tony tells Dr. Melfi a story about ducks landing in his pool. He describes his mother Livia, a cold, mean- spirited woman with whom he has an openly hostile relationship. By the end of the first session Tony has admitted that he feels depressed, but storms out when Dr. Melfi presses him further about the relationship between his symptoms and the ducks. When the family visits Green Grove, a retirement community where Tony is trying to place his mother, Livia's derisive outburst prompts a second panic attack. Melfi prescribes Prozac as an anti-depressant, telling him that no one needs to suffer from depression with the wonders of modern pharmacology. Tony fails to attend their next scheduled session. At their next session, Tony is still reluctant to face his psychological weaknesses. Tony is quick to credit the medication for his improved mood, but Dr. Melfi tells him it cannot be that, as it takes six weeks to work—she credits their therapy sessions. Tony describes a dream where a bird steals his penis. Melfi extrapolates that Tony has projected his love for his family onto the family of ducks living in his pool. This brings him to tears, to his consternation. She tells him that their flight from the pool sparked his panic attack through the overwhelming fear of somehow losing his own family. In the episode \\"46 Long\\", they continue discussing Tony's mother and her difficulties living alone. Tony admits that he feels guilty because his mother could not be allowed to live with his family. We learn that he has been left to care for his mother alone by his sisters. When Dr. Melfi asks him to remember good experiences from his childhood, he has difficulty. He blames Carmela for preventing his mother from living with them. Later they discuss Livia's car accident, and Melfi suggests depression may have contributed to the accident – Tony misunderstands her and becomes angry. Tony has a panic attack while visiting his mother's home after she moves to Green Grove. In a later session, Dr. Melfi pushes Tony to admit he has feelings of anger towards his mother, and he again storms out. During this episode, Tony introduces the concept of him acting like the sad clown – happy on the outside but sad on the inside. In \\"Denial, Anger, Acceptance\\", Tony discusses Jackie's cancer with Dr. Melfi. She tries to use it as an example of Tony's negative thinking contributing to his depression. Tony becomes angry and storms out. He feels she is trying to trick him and manipulate his thoughts using the pictures that decorate her office. After Jackie worsens and Tony is called a \\"Frankenstein\\" by a business associate, he returns to therapy to discuss these things with Dr. Melfi. She asks him if he feels like a monster. In \\"Fortunate Son\\", Tony discusses a childhood memory of an early panic attack. He saw his father and uncle mutilate Mr. Satriale, the local butcher, and later fainted at a family dinner made with free meat from Satriale's shop. Dr. Melfi makes a connection between meat and Tony's panic attacks. She explores his mother's attitude to the fruits of his father's labor. Later Dr. Melfi tries prescribing lithium as a mood stabilizer. In the episode \\"Isabella\\", Tony sinks into a severe depressive episode and experiences hallucinations—he sees a beautiful Italian woman named Isabella in his neighbor's garden. Tony sees Isabella several times during the episode and later learns that she never existed. Melfi theorizes that Isabella was an idealized maternal figure that Tony's subconscious produced because he was deeply upset about his own mother's actions at the time. In \\"I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano\\", Tony abruptly ends his therapy and persuades Dr. Melfi to go into hiding when he discovers that Uncle Junior has found out about their sessions. The relationship between Tony and Dr. Melfi is up-and-down, with Tony reaching a level of comfort with Dr. Melfi that he has never experienced with anyone else before, not even his wife. This closeness leads Tony to have something of a \\"crush\\" on Dr. Melfi, something that is unattainable. However, the \\"prying\\" from Dr. Melfi is uncomfortable for Tony and he often turns sarcastic and antagonistic towards her, leading to an ongoing strain in their relationship. In the episode when Tony's sister, Janice, goes back to Seattle, it is revealed during a rushed conversation between Janice and Tony that their mother suffers from narcissistic personality disorder. During the episode \\"The Second Coming\\", aired in part II of season six, Melfi's therapist suggests to her that her work with Tony could be considered enabling toward Tony's sociopathic tendencies. Finally, in the penultimate episode of the series, \\"The Blue Comet\\", Melfi severs her relationship with Tony after reading research recommended by her therapist that indicates sociopaths can use talk therapy to improve their skills in manipulating others and use what is learned in therapy to become more capable criminals. === Shootings === In the first season, Tony is attacked by William Johnson \\"Petite\\" Clayborn and Rasheen Ray, two hitmen sent by Donnie Paduana to execute Tony. Tony sustains an injury to his ear, which is partially shot off, and minor bruises and cuts from crashing his vehicle. One of the two assailants, Clayborn, is shot dead by Ray in an attempt to kill Tony, and Ray is left bruised but runs off. In the premiere of the sixth season, \\"Members Only\\", Junior Soprano, suffering from dementia, believes Tony to be Gennaro \\"Little Pussy\\" Malanga, and shoots him in the abdomen. Tony dials 911 but loses consciousness before being able to tell the operator what happened. The second episode of the sixth season, \\"Join the Club\\", Tony is in a medically induced coma in the hospital. In the second and third episode, the viewer sees Tony in a dream-like state, eventually arriving at what could be purgatory, where he is greeted by a man who takes the physical form of his late cousin Tony Blundetto. The shadowy figure in the doorway of the house has the profile of his mother, who is dead. The voice of a younger version of his daughter calls him back. At the end of the third episode, he awakes from his coma in a confused but stable state. By the fourth episode, Tony is mobile and fully aware and has regained his voice. Tony's attitude toward life is changed by his near-death experience. He has yet to discuss his experiences while unconscious with anyone close to him. However, in the Season 6 episode \\"Kaisha\\", he admits to Phil Leotardo (who had just suffered a heart attack), that while he was in a coma, he went to a place where he never wants to go again. While talking philosophy with John Schwinn, another patient at the hospital, he mentions that while in the coma he had the experience of being drawn towards somewhere he did not want to go and narrowly avoided it. In the sixth episode of season 6, part 2, \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\", Tony sustains minor injuries in a car accident that seriously injures his nephew, Christopher Moltisanti. Tony suffocates Christopher after this accident. Tony is on bed rest for a few days and quickly recovers. Nonetheless, this gives his family quite a scare and a painful memory of his nearly fatal shooting the previous year. ===Dreams=== Tony sometimes has vivid dreams that are shown to the viewer. Episodes with dream sequences include \\"Pax Soprana\\", \\"Isabella\\", \\"Funhouse\\", \\"Everybody Hurts\\", \\"Calling All Cars\\", and \\"The Test Dream\\". In the pilot, Tony tells Dr. Melfi about a dream he had wherein a screw in his belly button when removed, causes his penis to fall off. He tries to find a car mechanic (who had worked on his Lincoln when Tony drove Lincolns) to put it back on, but a duck swoops down and snatches it from his hand. In \\"Meadowlands\\", Tony has a dream that several people in his life are present in Dr. Melfi's office: Hesh Rabkin scrolling by the window, A.J. behind the door, Silvio Dante having sex with a woman in the waiting room, and Paulie Walnuts and Big Pussy reading Chinese newspapers. This causes him to worry that people will find out he is seeing a psychiatrist. The dream ends with Tony confronting Melfi, seeing Jackie Aprile, Sr. on his deathbed smoking a cigarette, asking Tony, \\"You smell that? That's rain,\\" and only to find out that Melfi is his mother, Livia. In \\"Pax Soprana\\", Tony has several dreams and fantasies about Dr. Melfi. He becomes convinced that he is in love with her, but she turns him down when he makes advances towards her. In \\"Isabella\\", Tony, suffering from depression after Big Pussy disappears, acquaints himself with a dental student named Isabella who is staying in the Cusamano home while they are on vacation. He later discovers that he'd hallucinated Isabella due to taking too much lithium and that Isabella represented the mother he never had. In \\"Funhouse\\", an extended dream sequence exposes many of Tony's subconscious thoughts and feelings through symbolic and sometimes bizarre events: he attempts suicide to preempt a doctor's diagnosis of early death by dousing himself in gasoline and lighting himself on fire; he witnesses himself shooting Paulie Walnuts to death during a card game; he has an innuendo-laden conversation with Dr. Melfi while sporting a prominent erection, and a fish that speaks with the voice of Big Pussy confirms his suspicions that the longtime friend and soldier is a federal informant. In \\"Everybody Hurts\\", Tony dreams of his ex-comaré Gloria Trillo shortly after learning of her suicide by hanging. He visits her apartment and finds her in a black dress with a black scarf around her neck. She is cooking dinner, and when she goes over to the oven the scarf drapes across Tony. Plaster falls in front of Tony and when he looks up, he sees that the chandelier is almost pulled out of the ceiling. Gloria is suddenly back at the table and offers Tony a choice between seeing what she has under her dress or her scarf. As she begins to peel away the scarf, Tony wakes up and makes his way to the bathroom for some medication. In \\"Calling All Cars\\", Tony has two dreams featuring Ralph Cifaretto. In the first, he is being driven by Carmela in the back of his father's old car while Ralph sits in the passenger seat. A caterpillar is crawling on the back of Ralph's head. Tony's fellow passenger in the back seat changes — Gloria Trillo and Svetlana Kirilenko are both seen. The caterpillar turns into a butterfly. Dr. Melfi later tells him that the dream signifies a change for Ralphie (recently killed by Tony) and Carmela being in control, which Tony doesn't like. In the second dream, Tony follows Ralph to an old house, which Ralph enters. Tony is dressed in trousers, suspenders, and an undershirt. He knocks on the door and a female figure descends slowly in shadow; the door creaks ominously. Tony says he is there for the stonemason job but does not speak English well (Tony's grandfather was an immigrant stonemason). Just as Tony is about to enter the house, he wakes up. In \\"The Test Dream\\", Tony comes to terms with having to kill his cousin Tony Blundetto. The episode reflects on his inner demons and fears, including his children's future, his relationship with his wife, his infidelities, deceased acquaintances—including some who have died by his hand or by his orders—his fate, and his relationship with his father. He is again shown in his father's old car, accompanied by a range of past associates. In \\"Join the Club\\", a comatose Tony finds himself in an alternate universe where he is a law-abiding salesman on a business trip. Among other differences, his accent has changed and his hotel's bartender condescends to him (in sharp contrast to the bartender at The Bing, who is a recurring punching bag for Tony). Tony has mistakenly taken another man's briefcase – Kevin Finnerty's – along with all of his identification and work. The episode follows his attempts to discern his identity, recover his briefcase, and get back to his family. In \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\", a stressed Tony Soprano has a dream following the death of Christopher Moltisanti. In this dream, he tells his therapist that Christopher was a burden and that he is relieved that he was dead. After that, he also tells her that he murdered Big Pussy and his cousin Tony Blundetto. Following the dream, he acts differently to his friends and family, trying to see if they also feel relieved now that Christopher is dead. ==Legacy and cultural impact== The character of Tony Soprano was one of the first likable \\"antihero\\" characters in television. Playwright Craig Wright stated, \\"A show like The Sopranos has a soothing quality because ultimately there’s an unspoken assumption behind it that even the most monstrous people are haunted by the same concerns we're haunted by.\\" Tony Soprano quickly became a pop culture icon during the show's run. In an article for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Lee referred to Tony Soprano as a \\"cultural sensation\\" who became the \\"unlikeliest of sex symbols.\\" On the importance of Gandolfini's performance, Lee stated: \\"He forever rejiggered television's fascination with morally challenged antiheroes and less-than- physically-perfect protagonists.\\" The Globe and Mail wrote, \\"Women made Tony Soprano an unlikely sex symbol – and the men found him no less seductive. Wish fulfillment has always been at the queasy heart of the mobster genre, the longing for a life outside the bounds of convention, mingled with the conflicted desire to see the perpetrator punished for the same transgression. So it was for the fictional men of the straight world on The Sopranos, who were drawn to Tony's flame with consistently disastrous results. Likewise for viewers, for whom a life of taking, killing, and sleeping with whomever and whatever one wants had an undeniable, if conflict-laden, appeal.\\" The final scene of \\"Made in America\\" became the subject of much discussion, controversy, and analysis after its original broadcast. The use of an abrupt cut to black followed by several seconds of silence led many viewers to initially believe that their cable or DVR had cut out at a crucial moment. Opposing interpretations soon emerged among viewers regarding the ultimate fate of Tony, with some believing that he was killed while others believe that he remains alive. The final scene continues to be interpreted by media and fans alike about the fate of Tony, however, Chase consistently refuses to give a definitive answer to the ending. Following Gandolfini's death on June 19, 2013, Gandolfini's portrayal of Soprano was praised for its influence on subsequent other TV characters. TV Guide columnist Matt Roush stated, \\"Without Tony, there's no Vic Mackey of The Shield, no Al Swearengen of Deadwood, no Don Draper of Mad Men\\" or \\"James St. Patrick of Power\\" (whose creators, Matthew Weiner and Courtney A. Kemp, respectively, honed their craft as writers on The Sopranos). Similar testimonials were included by his co-stars and colleagues; Bryan Cranston stated that his Breaking Bad character, Walter White, would not have existed without Tony Soprano.Roush, Matt (July 1, 2013). \\"A Soprano's Swan Song\\". TV Guide. pp. 18–21. Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised Gandolfini for his \\"towering central performance\\" as Tony Soprano, writing: \\"The Sopranos was part of a wave of American TV dramas that finally persuaded cineastes and critics who had been snobbish and dismissive about television as a medium to accept the smaller screen as an artistic equivalent of the larger one. Although many of those who watched and wrote about TV had got this message much earlier, the remarkable and sustained range of Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony Soprano played a major part in ending any remaining inferiority complex about the medium.\\" Gandolfini's son, Michael, was cast in 2019 for the upcoming 2021 film The Many Saints of Newark to play a young Tony Soprano, as a prequel to the show.‘Sopranos’ Prequel Film Finds Young Tony: Michael Gandolfini Is Chip Off Old Block Michael, having never watched The Sopranos, watched through it to prepare for the role, describing it as an intense process. == References == == External links == * HBO Character Profile: Tony Soprano Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional capos Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional characters based on real people Category:Fictional child abusers Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Fictional crime bosses Category:Fictional characters with major depressive disorder Category:Fictional gamblers Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional mobsters Category:The Sopranos characters sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Tony Soprano ","title":"Tony Soprano"},{"id":"515826","text":"Dorothy Bush may refer to: * Dorothy Bush Koch (born 1959), American author and philanthropist * Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush (1916–1991), American political activist * Dorothy Walker Bush (1901–1992), wife of Prescott Sheldon Bush ","title":"Dorothy Bush"},{"id":"515829","text":"PACS is an acronym with several meanings: ==Medicine== *Partial Anterior Circulation Stroke Syndrome, the symptoms of a type of an ischemic stroke *Picture Archiving and Communication System, a system used in medical imaging to store, retrieve, distribute, analyze, and digitally process medical images. ==Organizations and establishments== *Pacte civil de solidarité, a form of civil union in France *Palo Alto Chinese School, Palo Alto, California, USA *Poorest Areas Civil Society Program (2001-2008), a defunct Indian social welfare program *Primary Agricultural Credit Society, co-operative credit institutions in India *Prince Avenue Christian School, Oconee County, Georgia, USA *Provisional Army of the Confederate States, the \\"volunteer\\" or wartime- expansion component of the Confederate States Army ==Child psychology== *Phonological Assessment of Child's Speech, a type of analysis battery used in developmental psychology to ascertain if a child has a reading disorder. *Phonological Awareness Composite Scores, a marking criterion as part of the CTOPP assessment battery for assessing a child's awareness of the oral structure of language. ==Physics and astronomy== *Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme, a scheme developed by the American Institute of Physics *Payload Alert Communications System, a system to decrease the statistical uncertainty in the location of resident space objects *Photodetecting Array Camera and Spectrometer, an instrument of the Herschel Space Observatory ==PACs== PACs is the plural of PAC; for example: *Political action committees, groups organized to elect or defeat political candidates *Premature atrial contractions ==Other== *Primary airport control station, a survey marker established in the vicinity of an airport *Personal access control system.

Unlike the Ku Klux Klan, which drew much of its membership from lower-class southerners (primarily Confederate veterans), the White Camelia consisted mainly of upper class southerners, including physicians, landowners, newspaper editors, doctors, and officers. They were also usually Confederate veterans, the upper part of antebellum society. It began to decline, despite a convention in 1869. The more aggressive people joined the White League or similar paramilitary organizations that organized in the mid-1870s. By 1870, the original Knights of the White Camelia had mostly ceased to exist.Christopher Long, \\"KNIGHTS OF THE WHITE CAMELLIA\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 28 June 2010 Among its members was Louisiana Judge Taylor Beattie, who led the Thibodaux massacre of 1887.

He held the British ski jumping record from 1988 to 2001. He also took part in amateur speed skiing, running at , and a stunt jumping world record holder for jumping over 6 buses. In 2016, he was portrayed by Taron Egerton in the biographical film Eddie the Eagle. ==Background== Edwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His family calls him by his given name, Michael. \\"Eddie\\" is a nickname derived by schoolfriends from his surname.Edwards 2016, Chapter 2. Having not made the grade as a downhill skier, he switched to ski jumping as there were no other British ski jumpers with whom to compete for a place. Edwards began jumping under the eye of John Viscome and Chuck Berghorn in Lake Placid, New York, using Berghorn's equipment, although he had to wear six pairs of socks to make the boots fit. He was disadvantaged by his weight—at about 82 kg (181 lb, 12st 13lb), more than 9 kg (20 lb) heavier than the next heaviest competitor—and by his lack of financial support for training, being totally self-funded. Another problem was that he was very farsighted, wearing thick glasses under his goggles, which would mist up at altitude. Edwards first represented Great Britain at the 1987 World Championships in Oberstdorf in Bavaria, West Germany and was ranked 55th in the world. This performance qualified him as the sole British applicant for the 1988 Winter Olympics ski jumping competition. He received confirmation of his qualification for the games while working as a plasterer and temporarily residing in a Finnish mental hospital, due to lack of funds for alternative accommodation rather than as a patient.Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards – Olympic legend YouTube Edwards' jump of 71m at Calgary in the Winter Olympics was then a British record (now 134.50m held by Halifax born Sam Bolton). His Olympic jump still puts him sixth on the all-time list of British ski jumpers. ==1988 Winter Olympics== During the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Edwards competed in and finished last in both the 70 m and 90 m events. In the 70 m, he scored 69.2 points from two jumps of 61.0 m; second- last Bernat Solà Pujol of Spain scored 140.4 points from 71 m and 68.5 m jumps; winner Matti Nykänen of Finland had 229.1 points from 89.5 m jumps. In the 90 m, Edwards scored 57.5 points from 71 m and 67 m jumps; second-last Todd Gilman of Canada had 110.8 points from 96 m and 86.5 m; Nykänen won again, with 224 points from 118.5 m and 107 m. From the beginning, the press version of his story was \\"embroidered with falsehoods\\". \\"They said I was afraid of heights. But I was doing sixty jumps a day then, which is hardly something someone who was afraid of heights would do.\\" His lack of success endeared him to people around the globe. He subsequently became a media celebrity and appeared on talk shows around the world, appearing on The Tonight Show during the Games. The press nicknamed him \\"Mr. Magoo\\", and one Italian journalist called him a \\"ski dropper\\". At the closing ceremony, the president of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, singled out Edwards for his contribution. King said, looking at the competitors, \\"You have broken world records and you have established personal bests. Some of you have even soared like an eagle.\\" ===\\"Eddie the Eagle\\" Rule=== Following the widespread attention that Edwards received in Calgary shortly after the Olympics finished, the entry requirements were strengthened in order to make it nearly impossible for anyone to follow his example: the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted what became known as the Eddie the Eagle Rule, which requires Olympic hopefuls to compete in international events and be placed in the top 30% or the top 50 competitors, whichever is fewer. Edwards failed to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. He got a five-year sponsorship from Eagle Airlines, a small British charter company, to support his attempt to reach the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, but failed to qualify for those as well. ==Return to Calgary and other media appearances== On 13 February 2008, Edwards made a return visit to Calgary to take part in festivities marking the twentieth anniversary of the Games. During his visit, he rode the zip-line at Canada Olympic Park with a member of the Jamaican bobsled team (the ride simulates the speed of a ski-jumper) and led a procession of skiers down the slopes of the park while carrying an Olympic torch.Zip-line ride: Global News Calgary (television broadcast), 13 February 2008 Edwards was chosen as a torchbearer in the relay for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. He ran with the torch on 7 January 2010 in Winnipeg. Edwards released a book (and a video) called On the Piste. In 1991 he recorded a single in Finnish entitled \\"Mun nimeni on Eetu\\" (\\"My name is Eetu\\"), B-sided with \\"Eddien Siivellä\\" (\\"On Eddie's Wing\\") though he does not speak Finnish. Edwards learned the lyrics phonetically and the song reached no.2 in the Finnish charts. The songs were written by Finnish singer Irwin Goodman. In the same year (1991) Edwards completed a charity ski jump at a ski slope in Christchurch, Dorset. He raised £23000.00 for BBC Children in Need by jumping over 10 cars using a ski jump made of scaffolding. Edwards appeared in a number of advertising campaigns, e.g. on television, promoting cars, and commanded fees of £10,000 an hour. Nevertheless, he declared bankruptcy in 1992, claiming that a trust fund for his earnings was not set up properly. In 2003, he graduated from De Montfort University in Leicester with a degree in law. \\"I've been interested in law since taking out a civil action against my trustees 10 years ago,\\" he said in a 2001 interview. On 25 February 2012, he appeared as a competitor on episode 2 of BBC1's Let's Dance for Sport Relief, 2012 and got through to the final on most public votes. His performances were accompanied by the Royal British Legion Band & Corps Of Drums Romford. In 2013, he won the first series of the British celebrity diving programme Splash!, mentored by Tom Daley. In January 2014, he commentated on the Channel 4 TV programme The Jump, where 12 famous people took part in winter sports. As part of each episode, Edwards jumped off the largest of three ski jumps. In the same year he appeared as a guest on the ITV2 comedy show Fake Reaction. Edwards prior to his first jumps in 15 years at the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics. Riding Ski Jump lift again 29 years later. In 2017, he returned to the ski jumping facilities at Canada Olympic Park, where he had taken part in the Olympics in 1988, to make some jumps that were his first in over 15 years. ==Biopic== A film chronicling the life story of Edwards had been planned by Irish director Declan Lowney since 2007. Comedian Steve Coogan was originally chosen for the title role. Edwards was said to be pleased with the choice but also joked that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise would be better suited for the role. In 2009, Lowney announced that Rupert Grint would instead play the part. The film was scheduled to begin production once Grint completed work on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2, but it did not go ahead. On 23 December 2014, it was reported that Gary Barlow was in talks to write the entire soundtrack for the film. On 23 January 2015, it was reported that Edwards might perform the stunts in the movie about his life. Matthew Vaughn produced and Dexter Fletcher directed the biopic, starring Taron Egerton as Edwards, and Hugh Jackman as his trainer. The film, Eddie the Eagle, was released in early 2016. ==See also== * Eric Moussambani: Eric \\"the Eel\\", another famously unlikely Olympian * Philip Boit * Trevor Misipeka * Vinko Bogataj * Steven Bradbury * Elizabeth Swaney ==Bibliography== * ==References* * BBC Gloucestershire interview with Eddie \\"The Eagle\\" Edwards February 2008 * Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards Speaking Profile and Video *Eddie The Eagle 1991 Charity Ski Jump Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of De Montfort University Category:English non-fiction writers Category:English pop singers Category:English male ski jumpers Category:Musicians from Gloucestershire Category:Olympic ski jumpers of Great Britain Category:Sportspeople from Cheltenham Category:Ski jumpers at the 1988 Winter Olympics Category:English male non-fiction writers ","title":"Eddie the Eagle"},{"id":"515846","text":"Carmela Soprano (née DeAngelis), played by Edie Falco, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series The Sopranos. She is the wife of Mafia boss Tony Soprano. Edie Falco's performance as Carmela was universally lauded. She won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1999, 2001 and 2003, and received six nominations for her role in the series. Falco has also won two Golden Globe Awards and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. ==Character biography== Carmela was Tony Soprano's high school sweetheart, and the couple married at a young age. They have two children together: Meadow Soprano and Anthony \\"A.J.\\" Soprano, Jr. Carmela attended Montclair State University for an unspecified period of time before dropping out. Carmela is a homemaker for the Soprano household, and works to create a semblance of legitimacy for her family even though she is well aware their wealth is built on \\"blood money\\". Tony trusts Carmela enough to confide in her, to a degree, about some of his Mafia dealings (notably the failed attempt on his life and the death of Richie Aprile). Tony's work and constant infidelity have put a serious strain on the marriage and cause a period of separation. Carmela is an observant Roman Catholic and has difficulty rationalizing her husband's profession and the flaws in their marriage. Tony and Carmela often reconcile after Tony presents her with expensive gifts, notably jewelry, designer clothing, furs, cars, and even a $600,000 plot of land she wants to build a spec house on. Carmela sometimes has intense guilt for having sacrificed her children's security for the luxuries Tony's career could provide. She also defends her children from Tony when they do something wrong. She has shown herself willing to use her mob-wife status to intimidate others, as she does in \\"Full Leather Jacket\\", where she not-too-subtly manipulates her neighbor's Georgetown-alumna sister into writing a letter of recommendation for Meadow to Georgetown, hoping Meadow would not go to UC Berkeley but rather stay closer to home. Also, she discards a letter from Berkeley to Meadow requesting transcripts, but later retrieves it from the trash in a moment of guilt. While she is very proud of Meadow's accomplishments and ambition, Carmela is also jealous and resentful of her daughter for achieving the independence and success she always wanted herself. She constantly frets over A.J.'s troubles and inactivity, yet tends to coddle him and is unwilling to impose any real restrictions on him. She has trouble with her husband's profession, considering him more a Robin Hood-like character and just another \\"crook\\" rather than a brutal murderer. Carmela's resentment of her husband's infidelity has often driven her to the brink of breaking her marriage vows during some sexually charged moments with her priest, Father Phil Intintola (in \\"College\\"), and painter-decorator Vic Musto. During the fourth season, Carmela has a mutual romantic infatuation with Furio Giunta. Tony had secured Furio from the Camorra clan while on an inaugural trip to Naples, the Soprano family ancestral homeland, a trip that Carmela had wanted to be a part of. Carmela reaches a low point with Tony's constant string of affairs and the two have a romantically-tense but \\"arms-length\\" relationship for a period. Each confides to separate friends that they are falling for each other but Furio, no longer able to bear the burden that the internal conflict is causing him (that of his feelings conflicting with his honor, as well as his respect to the \\"family\\" hierarchy), sells his house and moves back to Italy. Carmela was devastated, and eventually revealed her feelings for him in an argument with Tony, to which Tony replies \\"If certain men see him, he's a dead man.\\" By the end of the fourth season, Tony and Carmela separate after Tony's former mistress Irina Peltsin calls the Soprano home, talks to A.J., and informs Carmela that Tony slept with Irina's cousin and Junior Soprano's nurse, Svetlana Kirilenko. Carmela even begins dating A.J.'s guidance counselor, Robert Wegler, and pursuing divorce proceedings against Tony, but is drawn back to her husband by financial concerns and difficulties in rearing A.J., as well as a difficult breakup with Wegler, who correctly accuses Carmela of using sex to manipulate him into giving A.J. special treatment in school. At the end of the fifth season, Carmela agrees to reunite with Tony after he agrees to purchase a $600,000 investment property in Montville, under Carmela's name, so she could build a spec house. Despite some initial awkwardness, the two are firmly reunited after Tony is shot by his uncle, Junior, both during his coma and after his hospital release. The crisis seems to have strengthened their bond. Carmela's selfish, materialistic nature is never far from the surface. After Tony surprises his delighted wife with a Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Carmela proceeds to flaunt her new car in front of Ginny Sack and Angie Bonpensiero, both of whom were reported to be having serious financial problems. Carmela is somewhat embarrassed when Angie admires Carmela's car and tells her that she recently purchased a Corvette with her own money, showing that Angie has achieved a certain level of financial independence and Carmela has not. Carmela's own efforts to become financially independent have been less successful, as Tony neglects to intervene for a long period when an inspector determines that materials used on her spec house are not up to code, thereby halting construction and straining her relationship with her father, who was building the house with her. Tony later recants, however, and orders Silvio Dante to lean on the inspector to change his mind. Around this time, Carmela is concerned for the whereabouts of Adriana La Cerva, who seemingly had disappeared. Carmela's concern intensifies when she encountered Adriana's mother, Liz La Cerva, at the Feast of St. Elzear (Episode 74, \\"The Ride\\"). Liz, who has stopped taking care of herself, tells Carmela that in fact Adriana is dead and Christopher is responsible, going on to say the FBI told her so. The next day, Carmela confronts Tony, who dismisses her: \\"Let me school you on domestic violence,\\" he says. \\"First and foremost, there is always a body.\\" Carmela is not aware that Adriana was a low-level informant for the FBI and that Christopher, who had learned this truth from Adriana herself, informed Tony, who in turn had her executed by Silvio (in \\"Long Term Parking\\"). She is also unaware that Tony murdered Christopher after he had flipped off the highway the SUV in which both were traveling (in \\"Kennedy and Heidi\\"). Carmela becomes greatly concerned for A.J. after he tries to commit suicide and is subsequently placed in the psychiatric ward at Mountainside Hospital. Carmela, along with Tony, encourages A.J. to become part of the production team for a film written by Daniel Baldwin and financed by Little Carmine, rather than enlist in the Army. She is shown considering building plans for a beach house, and in the final scene of the series, she meets Tony at a diner for a family meal. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Character Profile: Carmela Soprano Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional housewives Category:Fictional Republicans (United States) sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Carmela Soprano ","title":"Carmela Soprano"},{"id":"515848","text":"The frenulum of labia minora (fourchette or posterior commissure of the labia minora) is a frenulum where the labia minora meet posteriorly. ==Pathology== The fourchette may be torn during delivery due to the sudden stretching of the vulval orifice, or during copulation. To prevent this tearing in a haphazard manner, obstetricians and, less frequently, midwives may perform an episiotomy, which is a deliberate cut made in the perineum starting from the fourchette and continuing back along the perineum toward the anus. Sometimes this surgical cut may extend to involve the perineal body and thus reduce anal sphincter function. Thus some obstetricians have opted to perform a posterior- lateral cut in the perineum to prevent this potential complication from occurring. The fourchette may also be torn in acts of violence wherein forced entry occurs such as rape. When the fourchette is torn, the bleeding which ensues sometimes requires surgical suturing for containment. ==Etymology== The fourchette is named with the French word for \\"fork\\" or \\"wishbone\\", owing to its shape.

In the early seasons, Meadow is shown as a smart, spoiled, party-goer, over-dramatic, in-denial, and in some ways, a troubled kid. In the later seasons, she would later learn the consequences and reality of life, money, education, politics, and relationships. Her little brother, A. J., would later go through all these phases as he gets older. In 1997, Sigler was cast as Meadow Soprano; when her manager first told her about auditioning for The Sopranos, Sigler thought she would have to sing soprano. ==Biography== Meadow is the first-born child of Tony and Carmela Soprano. She was active in extracurricular activities in high school (playing on the championship girls' soccer team and singing in the chorus and school pageants), attended Columbia University, performing well in her classes after a poor first-year performance, and volunteered regularly at the South Bronx Law Center. Since her graduation, Meadow studied for medical school as she was interested in being a pediatrician, but she had second thoughts and considered a career in the legal profession. Meadow was often resentful of her lineage, stemming from a string of failed relationships first with Noah Tannenbaum, a fellow student who was African American and Jewish, who met with Tony's racist disapproval, who broke up with Meadow after his own father seemed concerned with Tony's occupation. This was followed by a romance with Jackie Aprile Jr., the son of Tony's deceased friend and fellow mobster, Jackie Aprile Sr. Meadow had fallen in love with Jackie Jr., and he made her happy for a while but cheated on her and became increasingly involved in organized crime. Jackie ultimately organized a robbery of a card game in which one man was killed and two others were wounded. After this incident and instructions from Tony to make a timely decision one way or the other, Ralph Cifaretto decided to get rid of Jackie Jr. As Jackie was exiting his hiding place, Vito Spatafore came up behind him and shot him through the back of the head, killing him instantly. The hit was publicized as a drug deal with African Americans gone bad, a story which Meadow publicly accepted but privately surmised that Jackie was killed by the mob. Her acceptance caused problems elsewhere. She still struggles with depression and uses alcohol and drugs while a college freshman. Just before his death, Meadow came to realize that Jackie was unfaithful; his death nevertheless distressed her strongly. She initially blaming Tony for Jackie's involvement with crime and Carmela for standing by and supporting Tony. The irony is that Tony attempted to discourage Jackie's aspirations, having promised Jackie Sr. on his deathbed to see that Jackie Jr. stayed away from the mob life. During her teens, Meadow was both very aware and resentful of her father's criminal enterprise and her family's complicity in it. However, Meadow reconciled herself with these facts and her attitude strongly mirrored Tony's own; publicly, she cited her father's position as a \\"waste management consultant\\" but in closer circles she rationalized the Mafia as a cultural tradition borne out of discrimination against her ancestors' social and national origins. Her life seemed further stabilized by her engagement to a Columbia dental student, Finn DeTrolio, of which her father approved. It was later revealed that Finn and Meadow had broken off the engagement. At the film premiere for Cleaver, Meadow reunited with and started dating Patrick Parisi. Patrick was the son of one of Tony's capos (Patsy Parisi). Meadow decided to not apply to medical school and, inspired by Patrick's passion for the law, applied to law school instead. She begins to plan her wedding to Patrick and, in the series' final scene, she is shown outside the diner where she arrived late for meeting her family for dinner, making a number of efforts to parallel park before she finally does, and heads toward the diner. In the final shot of the series, Tony looks up after hearing the restaurant door open. This may have been Meadow's entrance. In Tony's coma, she is voiced by Morgan Saylor. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Profile: Meadow Soprano Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional college students Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional methamphetamine users sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Meadow Soprano ","title":"Meadow Soprano"},{"id":"515884","text":"Anthony John \\"A.J.\\" Soprano Jr. (born July 15, 1986) is a fictional character on the HBO television series The Sopranos, played by Robert Iler. He is the son of Carmela and Tony Soprano. ==Biography== Anthony is the troubled younger brother of Tony and Carmela's more accomplished daughter, Meadow. A chronic underachiever with self-esteem issues, A.J. is diagnosed as borderline ADD. Additionally, he crashes his mother's car, smokes marijuana at his own confirmation, gets drunk on stolen communion wine, vandalizes his school swimming pool, and is finally expelled after cheating on a test. As a result, his parents arrange to send him to military school, until they discover that he suffers from the same anxiety and panic attacks that plagued his father and grandfather. Instead, he remains in public school. In the episode \\"Two Tonys\\", it is revealed that Tony had bought A.J. an elaborate $5,000 drum set, and in the episode \\"All Happy Families...\\", despite discovering that A.J. is not doing well in school and does not have an optimistic future as far as college is concerned, Tony gets him an almost new Nissan Xterra, though Tony claims it is a \\"motivational tool\\". A.J. is excited about the SUV, though he comments about the environmental impact of SUV's and claims he may encounter social pressure from school friends to drive a different vehicle. During the fifth season he also shows an increasing amount of disrespect to his mother, presumably due to the separation. He tends to relate to his father and ends up moving in with him during the separation; however, in the episode \\"Sentimental Education\\", when A.J. and Tony get into a scuffle over A.J.'s disrespect, as his father has him pinned against the wall, A.J. says, \\"One of these days, you wait...I'm going to kick your fucking ass.\\" Immediately afterwards, A.J. decides he wants to move back in with his mother, threatening to call social services due to the ongoing \\"violence against children\\" present in his father's home. Carmela takes the opportunity to demand certain things from A.J. in return for allowing him to move back in, like showing respect to his mother by not swearing at her and attending to schoolwork. Frequently throughout the series, Tony and Carmela express concern about A.J.'s future. Tony has no desire to groom his son into a position within his organization. In the fifth season of the show, A.J. displays an unexpected interest in pursuing a career in event planning, but later derides his parents' mentions of it (e.g., in \\"Mr. & Mrs. John Sacrimoni Request...\\"). In all seasons, A.J. is portrayed as a fan of heavy metal, via product placements (shirts, coats, posters and stickers) of bands like Pantera, Nevermore, Mudvayne (whose concert he attends in \\"All Happy Families\\"), Slipknot, Coal Chamber, Stuck Mojo, Machine Head, Soulfly and Fear Factory. By the end of the series, having grown more worldly and introspective, he discovers and begins analyzing the early work of Bob Dylan. Through various plot points and pieces of clothing, A.J. is identified as a fan of the New York Giants, New Jersey Devils and New York/New Jersey MetroStars. In \\"Full Leather Jacket\\", A.J. says that he wants to go to Harvard University or West Point for college. Tony dismisses the idea as unrealistic given A.J.'s poor academic performance. During Season 3, when Tony asks him about it at a family dinner, A.J. claims that he never said that, as he knows his grades wouldn't be good enough. Throughout Season 5, references are made to the unlikelihood of A.J.'s being admitted to a four- year university. In Season 6, A.J. admits to his parents that he has flunked out of the community college he was attending, a worrying parallel to Tony's own youth. After a senile Uncle Junior mistakes Tony as an intruder and shoots him, A.J. acquires a large knife and goes to the institution Junior is being held, in a futile effort to exact revenge for his father. He is arrested but later released without charge thanks to his father's political connections. At this time, he has been seen delving into the New York City club scene and experimenting with cocaine. After several days of Anthony's claiming to be searching for jobs on the Internet with no result, Tony intervenes and arranges a construction job for his son. A.J. first claims he cannot do it because he will be trying again for community college, but Tony says that is not a problem as many of the men who work in construction are high school and college students. A.J. is reluctant to accept the job because of the early hours and outdoor work, which makes Tony angry. Tony grabs a football helmet and smashes the windshield of A.J.'s Nissan Xterra, and warns A.J. not to test him. A.J. reluctantly works at the construction site where he meets Blanca Selgado, whom he begins dating. Blanca, who is Dominican, 10 years A.J.'s senior, and has a three-year-old son named Hector, meets with Carmela's disapproval. Tony however is more approving of the relationship, commenting that Blanca was Catholic like the Sopranos, at least. In 2007, A.J. proposes to Blanca at a fancy restaurant dinner by telling her that he will own a couple of restaurants in a couple of years. However, Blanca soon gives the ring back and breaks up with him, leaving A.J. severely depressed. His father tries to cheer him up, telling him there are many reasons he will meet other women and be successful in future relationships, including that he is smart, hard-working and white, \\"a huge plus nowadays\\". He quits his job and mopes about until his father forces him to attend a fraternity party with the college-age relatives of his fellow mafiosi. A.J. grudgingly attends, but soon starts to enjoy himself. Several of the boys run a sports betting operation at the college and after a night of drinking, they beat and torture a college student who neglected to pay them by pouring acid on his foot. A.J. joins in to help forget his relationship problems. Later, he joins his new friends again when one of them carelessly opens the door of his car, hitting a passerby on a bicycle. They make racial slurs towards the man, blame the accident on him, and attack the man. A.J. stands by, neither helping his friends, nor aiding the victim. Following that, A.J. is seen telling his psychiatrist that he is once again depressed about the world due to that incident. This depression would lead to a botched suicide attempt, wherein A.J. ties a cinder block to his leg with a too-long length of rope and attempts to drown himself in the pool at the Soprano home. His father hears his cries for help and dives into the pool and rescues him. He is then placed in a facility to get psychiatric care, where he meets Rhiannon, an ex- girlfriend of his former friend Hernan. After Tony tells him that his uncle Bobby has been shot dead, A.J. begins to cry and complain about how Bobby's death negatively affects him. Tony loses patience with him, violently drags him out of his bed, slaps him around, and tells him to pack as the family leaves home quickly to elude a possible attack by the Lupertazzi family. In the final episode, A.J. is in his Nissan Xterra with Rhiannon, his new girlfriend, and starts making out with her, but they both rush out of the vehicle when it catches fire due to A.J.'s parking it over a pile of leaves. He later decides he wants to join the Army, but is talked out of it by his parents and girlfriend. Instead, Tony gets him a new BMW M3 and a job working for Little Carmine's film production company. The job, with the possibility of A.J. opening up his own nightclub, which Tony proposes to his son if he does well with the job, seems to alleviate A.J.'s depression, and he is last seen having dinner with his family. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Profile: Anthony Soprano Jr. Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional players of American football Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Fictional smokers Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 ","title":"A.J.

It predominantly occurs in Ashkenazi Jews. It is the fourth most common coagulation disorder after von Willebrand's disease and haemophilia A and B. In the United States, it is thought to affect 1 in 100,000 of the adult population, making it 10% as common as haemophilia A.eMedicine - Hemophilia C : Article by Prasad Mathew, MBBS, DCH ==Signs and symptoms== In terms of the signs/symptoms of haemophilia C, unlike individuals with Haemophilia A and B, people affected by it are not ones to bleed spontaneously. In these cases, haemorrhages tend to happen after a major surgery or injury. However, people affected with haemophilia C might experience symptoms closely related to those of other forms of haemophilia such as the following: ==Cause== Chromosome 4 Haemophilia C is caused by a deficiency of coagulation factor XI and is distinguished from haemophilia A and B by the fact it does not lead to bleeding into the joints. Furthermore, it has autosomal recessive inheritance, since the gene for factor XI is located on chromosome 4 (near the prekallikrein gene); and it is not completely recessive, individuals who are heterozygous also show increased bleeding. Many mutations exist, and the bleeding risk is not always influenced by the severity of the deficiency. Haemophilia C is occasionally observed in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, because of inhibitors to the FXI protein. ==Diagnosis== The diagnosis of haemophilia C (factor XI deficiency) is centered on prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).One will find that the factor XI has decreased in the individuals body. In terms of differential diagnosis one must consider: hemophilia A, hemophilia B, lupus anticoagulant and heparin contamination. The prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time should completely correct with a 1:1 mixing study with normal plasma if haemophilia C is present; in contrast, if a lupus anticoagulant is present as the cause of a prolonged aPTT, the aPTT will not correct with a 1:1 mixing study. ==Treatment== Cyklokapron (Tranexamic acid) Fresh Frozen Plasma In terms of haemophilia C medication cyklokapron is often used for both treatment after an incident of bleeding and as a preventive measure to avoid excessive bleeding during oral surgery. Treatment is usually not necessary, except in relation to operations, leading to many of those having the condition not being aware of it. In these cases, fresh frozen plasma or recombinant factor XI may be used, but only if necessary. The afflicted may often suffer nosebleeds, while females can experience unusual menstrual bleeding which can be avoided by taking birth control such as: IUDs and oral or injected contraceptives to increase coagulation ability by adjusting hormones to levels similar to pregnancy. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * == External links == Category:Haemophilia ","title":"Haemophilia C"},{"id":"515889","text":"Alexandra Nechita (born August 27, 1985)Alexandra Nechita, IMDb.

They are characterised by an octagonal (eight-sided) plan, and often feature a flat roof and a veranda all round. Their unusual shape and appearance, quite different from the ornate pitched-roof houses typical of the period, can generally be traced to the influence of one man, amateur architect and lifestyle pundit Orson Squire Fowler. Although there are other octagonal houses worldwide, the term octagon house usually refers specifically to octagonal houses built in North America during this period, and up to the early 1900s. ==History== Early examples, before Fowler: *Poplar Forest, Thomas Jefferson's private retreat and plantation house near Lynchburg, Virginia. *William Thornton's John Tayloe III House, more commonly called The Octagon HouseWashington, DC-Octagon House Washington DC Octagon House in Washington, DC. After the White House was burned by the British during the War of 1812, President James Madison stayed in the Octagon House, and it was here that the Treaty of Ghent (ending the War of 1812) was signed. It is now the headquarters of the American Institute of Architects. While known as \\"The Octagon\\", it is worth noting that this particular building is not actually octagonal. Both houses are large brick buildings in the classical tradition. They may be seen as precursors, but are somewhat different from the Victorian octagon houses which are essentially domestic structures. ==Orson Squire Fowler== The leading proponent of octagonal houses was Orson Squire Fowler. Fowler was America's foremost lecturer and writer on phrenology, the pseudoscience of defining an individual's characteristics by the contours of the skull. In the middle of the 19th century, Fowler made his mark on American architecture when he touted the advantages of octagonal homes over rectangular and square structures in his widely publicized book, The Octagon House: A Home For All, or A New, Cheap, Convenient, and Superior Mode of Building, printed in the year 1848.The Octagon House, Orson S Fowler: Dover Publications, Inc., first edition 1848, 1853 edition reprinted in 1973. As a result of this popular and influential publication, a few thousand octagonal houses were erected in the United States, mostly in the Midwest, the East Coast and in nearby parts of Canada.Orson Squire Fowler: Phrenology and Octagon Houses 1809-1887 by John H. Martin ===Advantages of the octagon plan=== Compared with a square, an octagon encloses approximately 20% additional space with the same perimeter According to Fowler, an octagon house was cheaper to build, allowed for additional living space, received more natural light, was easier to heat, and remained cooler in the summer. These benefits all derive from the geometry of an octagon: the shape encloses space efficiently, minimizing external surface area and consequently heat loss and gain, building costs etc. A circle is the most efficient shape, but difficult to build and awkward to furnish, so an octagon is a sensible approximation. Victorian builders were used to building 135° corners, as in the typical bay window, and could easily adapt to an octagonal plan. ===Design principles=== Fowler's The Octagon House is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a pattern book but the popularity of the book lies in the way Fowler suggested some general principles, and encouraged readers to invent the details for themselves. Only a few examples are offered, and apart from plans, the book has only two illustrations to show how an octagonal house might look. First, he shows some ways of subdividing an octagonal floor plan. Next is Howland's octagonal plan, a small house designed by 'Messrs. Morgan and Brothers, architects' which is similar to the Norrish House illustrated below. There follows A description of the author's own residence, now known as Fowler's Folly, at Fishkill, of which more below. Finally, A superior plan for a good sized house, which is a development of the Fishkill plans, apparently proposed by his engraver. The main feature of his plans is a desire to eliminate unnecessary circulation space, sometimes to the point that the main staircase is inconvenient, and the external veranda is the best way to get around the house. Fowler was not an architect and in some ways, his theories needed an architect to bring them to a workable conclusion. Other design proposals include: * Flat roof to collect rainwater, with cisterns built-in to collect and distribute the water. * Rainwater filtering, using filter beds made up of alternating layers of sand and activated charcoal. * Central heating by distributing hot air from a furnace in the basement. * Flues, air ducts and speaking tubes built into the thickness of walls. Built examples vary greatly in how much of this influence is apparent. Although built in brick, the Watertown house featured in this article is an almost perfect embodiment of many of Fowler's ideas. ===Masswall construction=== Stacked board construction was recommended in the first edition of A Home for AllH. Ward Jandl, John A. Burns, Michael Auer. Yesterday's houses of tomorrow: innovative American homes, 1850 to 1950. Preservation Press, 1991. 49. but the third edition of Fowler's book, printed in 1853, had a new subtitle: A Home For All, or The Gravel Wall and Octagon Mode of Building, and was distinguished by Fowler's enthusiasm for concrete construction. He appears to be unaware that concrete has been in use since the Romans, attributing the discovery to a Mr Goodrich of Janesville, Wisconsin, and crediting himself with developing and popularizing the technique. Fowler knew gravel and lime were available in unlimited quantities in the prairies and saw the \\"gravel wall\\" as offering a new, cheap and durable way of building. His house at Fishkill was built in concrete. The walls were built up a few feet at a time, by pouring a mixture of gravel and lime into timber shuttering. As the concrete cured, the shuttering could be taken down and moved up to the next level. Modern concrete is made using Portland cement, not lime, but the main difference is the universal use of steel reinforcing bars, which greatly increase the strength of the material, and make it possible to build concrete beams and floor slabs as well as walls. Fowler used large stones to reinforce corners, but he used no other reinforcement, and was therefore restricted to walls. The roof, floors and verandas are therefore all of timber construction. ===Fowler's Folly=== To quote Fowler \\"...those studies which have eventuated in this work were instituted primarily in order to erect this very house\\". Construction began in 1848, the same year his book was first published, and took five years to complete. The house was large, 42 foot to each side of the octagon or 100 feet across, and built on a hilltop overlooking the Hudson River, where it could be seen for miles around. Fowler removed the top of the hill to create a level site and to provide material for his \\"gravel walls\\". This grand residence had four huge reception rooms which could be interconnected depending on the size of event, allegedly 60 rooms (counting small dressing rooms as well as proper rooms) and a glazed cupola rising to 70 feet above ground. Fowler's favourite writing room was an internal room on the third floor, lit only from the cupola via a fanlight over the door. The house had no central staircase, so visitors entered one of the main rooms through a small lobby, while family and staff used the basement entrance. There are verandas all round the house at first, second and third floor levels, linked by two outside stairs. The financial panic of 1857 led Fowler to rent out the house, which subsequently went through a series of owners. Fowler's Folly fell into disrepair, and finally - condemned as a public hazard - it was dynamited in 1897 by Fred C. Haight, demolition engineer for the city of Fishkill. ==Surviving examples== Estimates vary but hundreds of these Victorian-era homes are still standing across the United States and Canada. One estimate puts the number at 2,077. Even in their heyday, octagon houses were never mainstream- on the contrary, an eight-sided home seemed to be the choice of individualists, standing defiant among four- sided neighbors. The largest remaining octagon homes in the United States are Longwood in Natchez, Mississippi and the Octagon House in Watertown, Wisconsin. Both homes are open to the public. In Eastern Washington state one still sits where it was moved to in 1993 to Bridgeport, near the Columbia River. Fowler was influential, but not the only proponent of octagonal houses and other structures. There are also octagonal barns, schoolhouses, churches, and in Canada, octagonal \\"dead houses\\". ==Design variations== Within the central idea of the octagonal plan, these houses show a wide variety of both construction and outward form. They range from the modest two-storey Bevis- Tucker House, to the grandiose Armour-Stiner House (both are illustrated below). ===Plan geometry=== A full octagon house has 8 equal sides, although slight variations in length are not unusual. This is in fact the most common shape, but in some cases the basic octagon is partially obscured by additions, either all round as at the Zelotes Holmes House, or by adding a functional wing out of sight at the rear. The House of the Seven Gables in Mayo, Florida has gables on seven sides while the eighth side is extended to the rear. The Richard Peacon House in Key West, Florida, appears to be a full octagon from the street but the rear portion is squared off. ===Materials=== Fowler advocated the use of \\"gravel wall\\" construction for the walls.Northeast Journal: Fowler's Folly, Fishkill, NY This was an experimental technique at the time, and although some were built that way, most octagon houses were built the same way as ordinary houses, of timber frame, brick or stone. ==Examples of octagon houses== The following are examples of the 'true' octagon houses and the range of design variations to be found.

When record drawings were made, the house was dilapidated with the verandas missing: only an entrance porch can be seen here. The verandas were reinstated in 1973. Although one of the largest, the Watertown house is midway between the grandest and most modest surviving examples. It is well documented,Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division: drawings and photos by the Historic American Buildings Survey has been carefully restored, and is open to the public as a museum.Watertown Historical Society ===History=== Construction was completed 1854. The house fell into disuse and was taken over by the newly founded Watertown Historical Society, and opened to the public in 1938. It is still owned by the Society. ===Construction and innovations=== * The plan is a octagon, with a veranda all round at first and second floor levels. * The house is built on stone foundations, with external walls of brickwork thick. * The central square is made up of two leaves of brickwork with a cavity, which is used for chimney flues and warm air ducting, to heat rooms without fireplaces. The double wall eliminates the need for projecting chimney breasts. * The battlement effect at the top of the cupola is actually the four chimneys. * A furnace in the basement heats water, and warm air is ducted into the twelve main rooms, i.e. those adjoining the central square. * An elegant spiral staircase links all the floors. It is self-supporting on the inside and built into the walls on the outside of the stairwell. There is also a servants' staircase. * The house has a flat roof, sloping gently towards the center. * Rainwater from the roof was collected in a reservoir at third floor level, and overflows into a cistern next to the kitchen in the basement. * Publications regularly state the house has 57 rooms; however this includes every closet and passage. The number of habitable rooms is 29, including the octagonal room in the cupola. * Despite having 15 bedrooms there is just a single bathroom. ===Architectural style=== The house was inspired by Fowler's book, and is a good example of his theories put into practice. Features which are directly linked to his ideas, apart from the octagonal plan, are the central spiral staircase, symmetrical arrangement of rooms with interconnecting doors, the verandas running all round the building, and the flat roof surmounted by a cupola. In accordance with Fowler's theories, the detailing is relatively plain for the period. Openings are simply framed by moldings. The covered verandas lack excess detail, having modest turned balustrade spindles and supporting posts. The decorative effect of the house comes from the basic design features: the octagonal shape and the external verandas. ===Pros and cons of the octagon plan=== Fowler's concern with saving space is seen to typical effect here. There are four generously sized rooms on each floor, nearly 18 foot square, with connecting doors all round. The subsidiary rooms are less satisfactory, being triangular. The arrangement of rooms is rigidly the same on all floors because the partition walls are of brickwork, so they must stack one above the other. The central spiral stair is compact, but leaves one side of the house without direct access to the landings, so there are bedrooms only accessible through another bedroom - in the worst case, through two other bedrooms. The drawbacks of this arrangement are again a legacy of Fowler's influence, an unwillingness to sacrifice spaciousness in the rooms to sensible circulation arrangements. Fowler's own house had external staircases and the verandas were used for circulation and access to the rooms. ===Record drawings=== Below are drawings of the Watertown Octagon House dated March 28, 1935, prepared by the Historic American Buildings Survey. At that time the verandas were missing, removed when they became dangerously rotten. The survey drawings are a reconstruction of the house as it was originally built.

She is the psychiatrist of Mafia boss Tony Soprano. She is portrayed by Lorraine Bracco. ==Character description== Melfi is an Italian-American, with her father's family hailing from Caserta. She is a graduate of Bard College and Tufts University School of Medicine\\"Pilot\\" (Episode 1.01) and has an upscale lifestyle, living in a three-bedroom condominium in Essex Fells, New Jersey and shopping frequently at gourmet Italian shops (as revealed in \\"Meadowlands\\"). At the start of the series, Tony Soprano, a local mobster, was referred to Melfi, a psychiatrist, after having a panic attack. He tells her he is a waste management consultant but Melfi knows he is a mobster. Throughout season 1, during the power struggle between Tony and Uncle Junior over who will be boss, Junior informs Mikey \\"Grab Bag\\" Palmice that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist. This makes Junior, Mikey, and all other members of Junior's crew who were informed extremely angry and paranoid, for they fear Melfi could be potentially used as a witness to testify in court against the activities of the DiMeo Crime Family. In the season 1 penultimate episode \\"Isabella\\", two hit men are sent by Junior and Mikey Palmice in an attempt to assassinate Tony for supposedly giving information to Melfi; unfortunately for Junior and Mikey, the hit fails. One assailant is inadvertently killed by the other while trying to shoot Tony in his driver seat from the passenger side after Tony grabs the first assassin's gun. Tony throws the other hit man off onto the road, not killing, but injuring him. Tony laughs ecstatically but has taken his eyes off the road long enough to crash his SUV into a parked car, knocking him unconscious. Tony later informs Melfi that his enemies are aware of their therapy sessions, and she must go into hiding to avoid getting killed until everything blows over. To save his own life and Melfi's, Junior's top lieutenants Mikey Palmice and Chucky Signore are subsequently killed, the latter by Tony himself. Junior is only saved by being arrested by the FBI on racketeering charges. In the season 2 premiere episode \\"Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office...\\", Melfi is shown doing business and living in a small roadside motel in Wayne, New Jersey, telling her patients her office is being remodeled. After the last troublesome member of Junior's crew, Philly \\"Spoons\\" Parisi, is murdered, Tony informs Melfi that \\"it's over\\" and that she can go back to her normal life. In the season 3 episode \\"Employee of the Month\\", Melfi is walking alone through the parking garage to her car when she is attacked by a man. He grabs her from behind and, after she attempts escape and cries out for help, proceeds to drag her to the stairway of her building, where he violently rapes her. He leaves her lying helpless in the stairway, crying. At the hospital, she is visited by her ex-husband, Richard, who is relieved to find she is alright. Although her rapist is arrested, he is subsequently released because of the chain of custody is lost by police. This infuriates Melfi, in shock that he was released. She comments to her psychiatrist and colleague Elliot Kupferberg, \\"I could have that asshole squashed like a bug,\\" meaning that she could easily have her rapist killed by telling Tony that she was raped. She also inadvertently reveals to Kupferberg that the patient she is treating is Tony Soprano. More shock comes when Melfi is in the fast food restaurant where the rapist works. She sees his smiling picture on the wall as Employee of the Month (hence the episode title). Melfi herself feels a crazed desire for revenge and knows that a word to Tony Soprano would obtain it, but, like her ex-husband, she will obey the social compact. Later, Dr. Melfi has a dream. She buys a soda from a vending machine; when she reaches into the machine to get it, her hand is trapped inside. A Rottweiler appears and terrifies her. Then the rapist advances towards her. The dog turns and mauls the rapist, who cries in agony. With Kupferberg, she understands the meaning: the dog is Tony Soprano taking revenge on her behalf. She tells Tony and others she has been in a car accident. When he sees her, Tony is shocked and concerned by her injuries. He tells her he is now ready to see a behaviorist. She says, \\"No,\\" and starts crying. He goes to her, lays his hands gently on her, and asks what is the matter. She composes herself and asks him to return to his seat. He goes back, but asks, \\"What? You wanna say something?\\" After a tense pause, she says, \\"No.\\" Melfi also sees Dr. Kupferberg on a regular basis. In \\"The Second Coming\\", he tells her that a recent study has shown that talk therapy may only help a sociopath become more sociopathic. Elliot has commented that treating Tony Soprano gives her a \\"vicarious thrill\\". Melfi tells Elliott she used to find Tony attractive at first, but no longer. She does not mention that shortly before this session, she had an erotic dream about herself and Tony. Melfi attends a dinner party with Elliot and other colleagues, but the conversation turns to the recent study claiming sociopaths take advantage of talk therapy. Kupferberg angers and shocks her by revealing that Tony Soprano is her patient. However, she reads the study at home and is convinced of its findings. At his next session, Tony is relaxed; her responses become sarcastic and aggressive. When she says she intends to cease treating him, he is taken aback and hurt: \\"We're making progress! It's been seven years!\\" She says, \\"You don't give a shit about commitments, about what I do.\\" She waits for him to go, then closes the door on him. ==Character origins== David Chase modeled the character of Jennifer Melfi after his own psychiatrist. Lorraine Bracco played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, and she was originally asked to play the role of Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt that the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Profile: Dr. Jennifer Melfi * Walrus article Dr. Jennifer Melfi and Psychoanalysis Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional psychiatrists Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Fictional female doctors ","title":"Jennifer Melfi"},{"id":"515917","text":"of the field.Vivian, p. 150. Baron Hunsdon is a title that has been created three times. It was first created in 1559 in the Peerage of England for the soldier and courtier Henry Carey. His grandson, the fourth Baron, was created Viscount Rochford in 1621 and Earl of Dover, in the County of Kent, in 1628. These titles were also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He had already in 1640 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's barony of Hunsdon. However, on his death in 1677, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. The barony passed to his second cousin once removed, the sixth Baron. He was the great- grandson of Sir Edmund Carey, younger son of the first Baron. On his death, the title passed to his first cousin, the seventh Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Baron. On the latter's death in 1765, the barony became extinct as well. The second creation was in 1832 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lucius Cary, 10th Viscount Falkland, a peer of Scotland, was created Baron Hunsdon, of Scutterskelfe in the county of York. This title became extinct on his death in 1884. The title was created again in 1923 in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony was revived for the businessman the Hon. Herbert Gibbs, who was made Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon, of Briggens in the County of Hertford. Gibbs was the fourth son of Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham (see the Baron Aldenham for earlier history of the family). He was a partner in the family firm of Antony Gibbs & Sons, and also served as Chairman of the Public Works Loan Board. In 1908, Gibbs acquired Hunsdon House and the Briggens estate in Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. In 1939, he succeeded his cousin to the barony of Aldenham. The two baronies remain united. ==Barons Hunsdon, first creation (1559)== *Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (1526–1596) *George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1547–1603) *John Carey, 3rd Baron Hunsdon (c. 1556 – 1617) *Henry Carey, 4th Baron Hunsdon (c. 1580 – 1666, created Viscount Rochford in 1621 and Earl of Dover in 1628) ===Viscounts Rochford (1621)=== *Henry Carey, 1st Viscount Rochford (c. 1580 – 1666, created Earl of Dover in 1628) ===Earls of Dover (1628)=== *Henry Carey, 1st Earl of Dover (c. 1580 – 1666) *John Carey, 2nd Earl of Dover (1608–1677) At the death of the 2nd Earl, the viscountcy and the earldom became extinct. ===Barons Hunsdon, first creation (1559; reverted)=== *Robert Carey, 6th Baron Hunsdon (b. 1652 – 1692) *Robert Carey, 7th Baron Hunsdon (b. 1649 – 1702) *William Ferdinand Carey, 8th Baron Hunsdon (1684–1765) At the death of the 8th Baron, the barony became extinct. ===Male-line family tree=== ==Baron Hunsdon, second creation (1832)== *Lucius Bentinck Cary, 10th Viscount Falkland (1803–1884) ==Barons Hunsdon, third creation (1923)== *Herbert Cokayne Gibbs, 1st Baron Hunsdon (1854–1935) *Walter Durant Gibbs, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1888–1969, succeeded as Baron Aldenham in 1939) ==See also== * Baron Wraxall ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

'The White House had a perfect deal with Miller ... Chalabi is providing the Bush people with the information they need to support their political objectives, and he is supplying the same material to Judy Miller. Chalabi tips her on something and then she goes to the White House, which has already heard the same thing from Chalabi, and she gets it corroborated. She also got the Pentagon to confirm things for her, which made sense, since they were working so closely with Chalabi. Too bad Judy didn't spend a little more time talking to those of us who had information that contradicted almost everything Chalabi said.' Long after the fact, Miller conceded in her interview with me that she was wrong about the tubes, but not that she had made a mistake.\\" She worked in The New York Times Washington bureau before joining Fox News in 2008. Miller co-wrote a book Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, which became a top New York Times best seller shortly after she became a victim of a hoax anthrax letter at the time of the 2001 anthrax attacks.Judith Miller (Oct. 14, 2001), \\"A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LETTER; Fear Hits Newsroom In a Cloud of Powder , The New York Times. The New York Times determined that several stories she wrote about Iraq were inaccurate, and she was forced to resign from the paper in 2005. According to commentator Ken Silverstein, Miller's Iraq reporting \\"effectively ended her career as a respectable journalist\\".Ken Silverstein (Aug. 15, 2013), Anatomy of an Al Qaeda “Conference Call” , Harper's. Miller defended her reporting, stating \\"My job isn't to assess the government's information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of The New York Times what the government thought about Iraq's arsenal.\\" She published a memoir, The Story: A Reporter's Journey, in April 2015. Miller was involved in the Plame Affair, where Valerie Plame was outed as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spy by Richard Armitage after her husband published a New York Times op-ed casting doubts on claims that Saddam Hussein sought to purchase uranium from Africa. Miller spent 85 days in jail for refusing to reveal that her source in the Plame Affair was Scooter Libby. Later, she contributed to the conservative Fox News Channel and Newsmax, and was a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute.Alex Pareene (Dec. 30, 2010) \\"Judith Miller: From the Times to the nuts\\", Salon. ==Early life== Miller was born in New York City. Her Russian- born father, Bill Miller, was Jewish. He owned the Riviera night club in New Jersey and later operated several casinos in Las Vegas. Bill Miller was known for booking iconic Las Vegas performers. His biggest success was getting Elvis Presley to return to Las Vegas after initially being an unsuccessful booking. Her mother was a \\"pretty Irish Catholic showgirl.\\" Miller attended Ohio State University, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University in 1969 and received a master's degree in public affairs from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Early in her career at The New York Times bureau in Washington, D.C. she dated one of the newspaper's other reporters (and future investment banker) Steven Rattner. In 1993, she married Jason Epstein, an editor and publisher. Judith Miller is the half-sister of Jimmy Miller who was a record producer for many classic Rock bands of the 1960s through to the 1990s including the Rolling Stones, Traffic and Cream. Jimmy Miller ==Career at The New York Times== Miller and Mike Pence in 2005 During Miller's tenure at The New York Times, she was a member of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, for its 2001 coverage of global terrorism before and after the September 11 attacks. She and James Risen received the award and one of the cited articles appeared under her byline. With reprints of ten 2001 works. Her writing during this period was criticised by Middle-east scholar Edward Said for evincing an anti-Islamic bias. In his book Covering Islam Said stated that Miller's book God Has Ninety-Nine Names \\"is like a textbook of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam.\\" He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that \\"nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject.\\" He concluded Miller \\"fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn't bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world.\\" However, Miller asserted that in the wake of the September 11 attacks she argued that militant Islamism of the type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance. ===Anthrax hoax victim=== On October 12, 2001, Miller opened an anthrax hoax letter mailed to her New York Times office. The 2001 anthrax attacks had begun occurring in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and the New York Post, all in New York City, as well as the National Enquirer in Boca Raton, Florida. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy in Washington. Twenty-two people were infected; five died. In 2008, the government's investigation of these mailings focused on Bruce Ivins, who later committed suicide, with the investigation determining that Ivins acted alone. Miller was the only major U.S. media reporter, and The New York Times the only major U.S. media organization, to be victimized by a fake anthrax letter in the fall of 2001. Miller had reported extensively on the subject of biological threats and had co-authored, with Stephen Engelberg and William Broad, a book on bio-terrorism, Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, which was published on October 2, 2001. Miller co- authored an article on Pentagon plans to develop a more potent version of weaponized anthrax, \\"U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits\\", published in The New York Times on September 4, 2001, weeks before the first anthrax mailings.Miller, Judith \\"U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits\\" , The New York Times, September 4, 2001. Miller also participated in a senior-level bio-terror attack simulation on Oklahoma City conducted on June 22 and June 23, 2001, called \\"Operation Dark Winter\\"; her role was media reporter/observer. ===Islamic charities search leak=== Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government was considering adding the Holy Land Foundation to a list of organizations with suspected links to terrorism and was planning to search the premises of the organization. The information about the impending raid was given to Miller by a confidential source. On December 3, 2001, Miller telephoned the Holy Land Foundation for comment, and The New York Times published an article in the late edition papers and on its website that day. The next day, the government searched HLF's offices. These occurrences led to a lawsuit brought by US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales,New York Times v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 160 (2006). with prosecutors claiming that Miller and her colleague Philip Shenon had queried this Islamic charity, and another, in ways that made them aware of the planned searches.A brief analysis of the decisions in New York Times v. Gonzales and Miller v. Unitesd States/Cooper v. United States is at: Ongoing confidential sources cases, accessed October 31, 2009. ===The Iraq War=== At The New York Times, Miller wrote on security issues, particularly about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Many of these stories later turned out to have been based upon faulty information.NYTimes Editors (May 26, 2004), \\"FROM THE EDITORS; The Times and Iraq\\" , The New York Times (One of her stories that wasn't disproved reported that inspectors in Iraq \\"saw nothing to prompt a war.\\") On September 8, 2002, Miller and her Times colleague Michael R. Gordon reported the interception of \\"aluminum tubes\\" bound for Iraq. Her front-page story quoted unnamed \\"American officials\\" and \\"American intelligence experts\\" who said the tubes were intended to be used to enrich nuclear material, and cited unnamed \\"Bush administration officials\\" who claimed that, in recent months, Iraq had \\"stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and [had] embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an atomic bomb\\".Michael R. Gordon and Judith Miller (Sept. 8, 2002), \\"U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts , The New York Times Miller added that > Mr. Hussein's dogged insistence on pursuing his nuclear ambitions, along > with what defectors described in interviews as Iraq's push to improve and > expand Baghdad's chemical and biological arsenals, have brought Iraq and the > United States to the brink of war. Shortly after Miller's article was published, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld appeared on television and pointed to Miller's story in support of their position. As summarized by The New York Review of Books, \\"in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration's case for war, and the Times played a critical part in legitimizing it.\\" Miller later said of the controversy > [M]y job isn't to assess the government's information and be an independent > intelligence analyst myself.

Miller went on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer and stated: > Well, I think they found something more than a smoking gun.

A week after it appeared, one Times insider called Miller's piece \\"wacky-assed\\" and complained there were \\"real questions about it and why it was on page 1.\\"Off the Record , New York Observer, Sridhar Pappu, April 28, 2003. Retrieved January 29, 2019. On May 26, 2003, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post reported on a Miller internal email sent to John Burns, the Times Baghdad bureau chief. In it she admitted her source regarding the alleged WMDs, according to Seymour Hersh writing for The New Yorker, was none other than Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress, which claims Pentagon officials passed on to Miller, despite the Central Intelligence Agency disagreeing with its content. Her Times editor, Andrew Rosenthal, criticized Hersh for its release.'Scoops' and Truth at the Times - What happens when Pentagon objectives and journalists' needs coincide , The Nation, Russ Baker, June 5, 2003. Retrieved January 24, 2019. A year later, on May 26, 2004, a week after the U.S. government apparently severed ties with Chalabi, a Times editorial acknowledged that some of the paper's coverage in the run-up to the war had relied too heavily on Chalabi and other Iraqi exiles, who were bent on regime change. The editorial also expressed \\"regret\\" that \\"information that was controversial [was] allowed to stand unchallenged.\\" However, the editorial explicitly rejected \\"blame on individual reporters.\\" \\"sampling of articles published by The Times about the decisions that led the United States into the war in Iraq, and especially the issue of Iraq's weapons\\" On May 27, 2004, the day after the Times mea culpa, James C.

Moore (May 27, 2004), \\"Not fit to print: How Ahmed > Chalabi and the Iraq war lobby used New York Times reporter Judith Miller to > make the case for invasion\\" , Salon The statement about being \\"proved ... right\\" was in relation to another Miller story, wherein she'd claimed that trailers found in Iraq had been shown to be mobile weapons labs.Judith Miller and William J. Broad (May 21, 2003), \\"AFTEREFFECTS: GERM WEAPONS; U.S. Analysts Link Iraq Labs To Germ Arms\\" , The New York Times However that claim, too, was subsequently refuted as false.Alexander Cockburn (Aug. 16, 2003), \\"Judy Miller's War\\" , CounterpunchByron Calame (Oct. 23, 2005), \\"The Miller Mess: Lingering Issues Among the Answers\\" , The New York Times It was alleged later in Editor & Publisher that, while Miller's reporting \\"frequently [did] not meet published Times standards\\", she was not sanctioned and was given a relatively free rein, because she consistently delivered frequent front-page scoops for the paper by \\"cultivating top-ranking sources.\\"Douglas Jehl (Sept. 29, 2003), \\"AGENCY BELITTLES INFORMATION GIVEN BY IRAQ DEFECTORS\\" , The New York Times In 2005, facing federal court proceedings for refusing to divulge a source in the Plame affair criminal investigation,Don van Natta Jr., Adam Liptack and Clifford J.

(where French terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui was also held).Rachel Weiner (July 12, 2018), \\"Paul Manafort moves to Alexandria jail, a past home to spies and terrorists\\" , Chicago Tribune After her release, the Times' Public Editor Byron Calame wrote: > Ms. Miller may still be best known for her role in a series of Times > articles in 2002 and 2003 that strongly suggested Saddam Hussein already had > or was acquiring an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction ... Many of those > articles turned out to be inaccurate ... [T]he problems facing her inside > and outside the newsroom will make it difficult for her to return to the > paper as a reporter. Two weeks later, Miller negotiated a private severance package with Times publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. She contested Calame's claims about her reporting and gave no ground in defending her work. She cited \\"difficulty\\" in performing her job effectively after having become \\"an integral part of the stories [she] was sent to cover.\\" In a 2018 interview with The Intercept, James Risen defended Miller by saying that there was a \\"systemic problem at the paper\\" in regards to reporting about the existence of WMD's. He said the paper wanted \\"stories about the existence of WMD\\" rather than \\"skeptical stories\\". ==Contempt of court== On October 1, 2004, federal Judge Thomas F. Hogan found Miller in contempt of court for refusing to appear before a federal grand jury, which was investigating who had leaked to reporters the fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA operative. Miller did not write an article about the subject at the time of the leak, but others did, notably Robert Novak, spurring the investigation. Judge Hogan sentenced her to 18 months in jail, but stayed the sentence while her appeal proceeded. On February 15, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld Judge Hogan's ruling. On June 17, 2005, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On July 6, 2005, Judge Hogan ordered Miller to serve her sentence at \\"a suitable jail within the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia\\". She was taken to Alexandria City Jail on July 7, 2005. In a separate case, Federal Judge Robert W. Sweet ruled on February 24, 2005, that Miller was not required to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Patrick Fitzgerald, the same prosecutor who had had Miller jailed in the Plame case, argued that Miller's calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller's phone records to confirm the time of the tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor's needs were outweighed by a 'reporter's privilege' to keep sources confidential. On August 1, 2006, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Sweet's decision, holding 2–1 that federal prosecutors could inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge Ralph K. Winter, Jr. wrote: \\"No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, much less to indict or not indict, without the reporters' evidence\\". Prior to her jailing for civil contempt, Miller's lawyers argued that it was pointless to imprison her because she would never talk or reveal confidential sources. Under such circumstances, argued her lawyers, jail term would be \\"merely punitive\\" and would serve no purpose. Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller's lawyers suggested that \\"impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her\\".Carol D. Leonnig, \\"Reporters Ask Judge for Home Detention\\" , The Washington Post, July 2, 2005, p. A02. Failing that, Miller's lawyers asked that she be sent to a women's facility in Danbury, Connecticut, nearer to \\"Ms. Miller's 76-year-old husband\\", retired book publisher Jason Epstein, who lives in New York City, and whose state of health was the subject of a confidential medical report filed by Miller's attorneys. Upon being jailed, the Times reported on July 7, 2005, that Miller had purchased a cockapoo puppy to keep her husband company during her absence. On September 17, 2005, The Washington Post reported that Miller had received a \\"parade of prominent government and media officials\\" during her first 11 weeks in prison, including visits by former U.S. Republican Senator Bob Dole, NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and John R. Bolton, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. After her release on September 29, 2005, Miller agreed to disclose to the grand jury the identity of her source, Lewis Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff. On Tuesday, January 30, 2007, Miller took the stand as a witness for the prosecution against Lewis Libby. Miller discussed three conversations she had had with Libby in June and July 2003, including the meeting on June 23, 2003. In her first appearance before the grand jury, Miller said she could not remember. According to The New York Times, when asked if Libby discussed Valerie Plame, Miller responded in the affirmative, \\"adding that Libby had said Wilson worked at the agency's (C.I.A.) division that dealt with limiting the proliferation of unconventional weapons\\". The trial resulted in guilty verdicts against Libby. ==Refusal to disclose source== In July 2005, several months prior to her October 2005 resignation from The New York Times, Miller was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating a leak naming Valerie Plame as a CIA officer. While Miller never wrote about Plame, she was believed to be in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation. According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official, later revealed to be I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff, on July 8, 2003. Plame's CIA identity was divulged publicly in a column by conservative political commentator Robert Novak on July 14, 2003. Novak's source was revealed to have not been Libby, but Richard Armitage of the Department of State. On July 16, 2005, The Washington Post reported that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, which could have extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated. The Post suggested that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was particularly interested in hearing Miller's version of her encounter with Libby. Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005, but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005. For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. This was several weeks before Joseph Wilson's New York Times editorial was published. This belied the theory that Libby was retaliating against Wilson for his Times editorial. According to Miller's notes from that earlier meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her July 8, 2003, meeting with Libby contains the name \\"Valerie Flame [sic]\\".Don Van Natta Jr., Adam Liptak & Clifford J. Levy This reference occurred six days before Novak published Plame's name and unmasked her as a CIA operative. Miller's grand jury account was the basis for her last article in The New York Times. The newspaper published Miller's first-person account, \\"My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room\\", on October 16, 2005. Miller said she could not remember who gave her the name \\"Valerie Plame\\" but she was sure it didn't come from Libby. Miller testified as a witness on January 30, 2007, at the trial of Scooter Libby, which began in January 2007. The trial ended on March 6, 2007, with Libby's conviction on four of five counts, though none of the counts had to do with actually revealing Plame's name to the media. ==Independent journalist and author== Since leaving The New York Times, Miller has continued her work as a writer in Manhattan and has contributed several op-ed pieces to The Wall Street Journal. On May 16, 2006, she summarized her investigations on U.S. foreign policy regarding Libya's dismantling of its weapons programs in an essay published in two parts.Judith Miller, \\"How Gadhafi Lost His Groove: The complex surrender of Libya's WMD\\", The Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2006, Archived at Miller's website ; \\"Gadhafi's Leap of Faith\\". The Wall Street Journal, May 17, 2006, Archived at Miller's website . On May 17, 2006, NavySEALs.com and MediaChannel.org published an exclusive interview with Miller in which she detailed how the attack on the USS Cole led her to investigate Al-Qaeda and, in July 2001, to her receiving information from a top-level White House source concerning top-secret NSA signals intelligence (SIGINT) about an impending Al- Qaeda attack, possibly against the continental United States. Two months later, on September 11, Miller and her editor at the Times, Stephen Engelberg, both regretted not writing that story.Rory O'Connor and William Scott Malone, On September 7, 2007, she was hired as an adjunct fellow of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a neo-conservative free-market think tank. Her duties included being a contributing editor for the organization's publication, City Journal. On October 20, 2008, Fox News announced that it had hired Miller. As of 2018, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She has also been a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and has served on a prestigious National Academy of Sciences panel examining how best to expand of the work of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, which since 1991 has sought to stop the spread of WMD material and expertise from the former Soviet Union. She lectures frequently on the Middle East, Islam, terrorism, biological and chemical weapons, as well as other national security topics. ==The Iraq War revisited== On April 3, 2015, The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece by Miller in which she defended her comportment during the lead-up to the war in Iraq, as well as the Bush administration's stance and decisions regarding the war. \\"Officials [of the Bush administration] didn't lie, and I wasn't fed a line,\\" she wrote. Miller acknowledged that \\"there was no shortage of mistakes about Iraq, and I made my share of them. The newsworthy claims of some of my prewar WMD stories were wrong\\", but rejected the notion that \\"I took America to war in Iraq. It was all me\\", which according to her \\"continue[d] to have believers\\". Critics subsequently wrote that \\"Miller's war reporting was disastrously wrong, and now she's trying desperately to spin it all away,\\". Valerie Plame commented that while \\"no one is crediting [Miller] with starting the Iraq war,\\" and she was \\"not actually on the team that took us into the biggest, most tragic US foreign policy debacle ever..., [Miller's] attempt to re-write history is both pathetic and self-serving.\\" The Guardian wrote that \\"in arguing that Bush was a victim of faulty intelligence analysis, Miller ignores extensive reporting showing that the Bush administration was making plans for an Iraq invasion before the advent of intelligence used to justify it.\\" Others focused on what they termed as factual inaccuracies, such as Miller's claim that \\"Hans Blix, the former chief of the international weapons inspectors, bears some responsibility [for the war]\\" because he \\"told the U.N. in January 2003 that despite America's ultimatum, Saddam was still not complying fully with his U.N. pledges.\\" Her critics pointed out that, although Blix indeed reported that \\"Iraq wasn't fully compliant,\\" he also reported that Iraq was \\"largely cooperative with regard to process,\\" and, subsequently, \\"made it abundantly clear, in an interview published in The New York Times, that nothing he'd seen at the time justified war,\\" an interview taken by Miller herself. ==Memoir== In April 2015, Miller published The Story: A Reporter's Journey, a memoir that focused largely on her reporting during the second Gulf War. Her former colleague Neil Lewis characterized most of the reviews as \\"unreservedly critical\\". Writing in The New York Times, former Los Angeles Times reporter Terry McDermott wrote that although \\"this is not a score-settling book\\", he found it \\"sad and flawed\\". Ιn The Washington Post, Erik Wemple wrote that the book's \\"dynamic\\" of \\"Judy Miller against the world\\" lends her book an aspect that is \\"both depressing and desperate\\". A review in The Columbia Journalism Review called the book \\"less a memoir than an apologia and an assault\\". In The Daily Beast, Lloyd Grove characterized Miller's work as \\"self-pitying\\". Criticizing Miller's failure to fully take responsibility for the flaws in her reporting, Matt Taibbi wrote in Rolling Stone: \\"Most of The Story is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller's homework. ... Mostly, she just had a lot of rotten luck. Or at least, that's how it reads. It's a sweeping, epic non- apology. Every bad thing Miller has ever been accused of turns out to be wrong or taken out of context, according to her.\\" ==Bibliography== *One, by One, by One: Facing the Holocaust, Simon & Schuster (1990) *Saddam Hussein & the Crisis in the Gulf (with Laurie Mylroie) Random House USA Inc (1990) *God Has Ninety Nine Names: Reporting from a Militant Middle East, Simon & Schuster (1997) *Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War (with William Broad and Stephen Engelberg) Simon & Schuster (2001) *The Story: A Reporter's Journey, Simon & Schuster, (April 7, 2015), ==See also== * Reporters' privilege * Journalistic scandal ==External sources== * Jon Stewart grills Miller on Iraq War reporting, Interview April 30, 2015. ==References* * Category:1948 births Category:American expatriates in Israel Category:American investigative journalists Category:American people of Belarusian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American political writers Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:American women war correspondents Category:Barnard College alumni Category:Criticism of journalism Category:Fox News people Category:Journalists imprisoned for refusing to reveal sources Category:Living people Category:Manhattan Institute for Policy Research Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:People associated with the Plame affair Category:Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism winners Category:The New York Times writers Category:The New York Times editors Category:Princeton School of Public and International Affairs alumni Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:Writers from New York City Category:Writers on the Middle East ","title":"Judith Miller"},{"id":"515924","text":"Quantitative analysis may refer to: * Quantitative research, application of mathematics and statistics in economics and marketing * Quantitative analysis (chemistry), the determination of the absolute or relative abundance of one or more substances present in a sample * Quantitative analysis of behavior, quantitative models in the experimental analysis of behavior * Mathematical psychology, an approach to psychological research using mathematical modeling of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes * Statistics, the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data, in social science ==See also== * QA (disambiguation) ","title":"Quantitative analysis"},{"id":"515925","text":"Christopher Moltisanti, played by Michael Imperioli, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series The Sopranos. He is Tony Soprano's protégé and a member of the DiMeo crime family, rising from associate to caporegime over the course of the series. When Imperioli auditioned for the role of Christopher, he thought that series creator David Chase was unimpressed with his audition and was surprised when he was offered the part. Tony Soprano has been a father figure to Christopher since the death of his father, Dickie Moltisanti. Tony affectionately refers to Christopher as his \\"nephew\\", but he is actually a cousin once removed of Tony's wife Carmela. Christopher is a volatile, narcissistic and impulsive young man, frustrated by his perceived lack of progress in the business. Christopher oversteps his authority when he hijacks trucks under the protection of family boss Junior Soprano. To teach him a lesson, Junior orders his mock execution. In the second season Chris is shot by his subordinates Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte but survives. Tony trusts Christopher with sensitive tasks, such as disposing of the bodies of murdered capos Richie Aprile and Ralph Cifaretto, and arranging the assassination of New York boss Carmine Lupertazzi. In the third season Chris finally becomes a made man. This leads to friction with his new capo Paulie Gualtieri, culminating in the Pine Barrens incident and although they make an uneasy truce, they clash again on several occasions. By the sixth season he is promoted to capo, and Tony tells Christopher that he will lead the family into the 21st century. Christopher has a tumultuous and abusive relationship with his long-term girlfriend Adriana La Cerva. He comes close to death when, enraged about rumors that his fiancée Adriana and Tony are having an affair, he pulls a gun on Tony, who is ready to kill him for the insult. He is spared only after Tony Blundetto intercedes for him. In the fifth season Chris learns that Adriana has been working as an informant for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and that she wants them to go into the Witness Protection Program. Valuing loyalty over love, Christopher reports Adriana's actions to Tony, who has Silvio Dante kill her. Christopher then marries his new girlfriend Kelli Lombardo and they have a daughter, Caitlyn, but his interest in his new wife soon wanes. He grows disillusioned with Tony and frustrated with his progress in the family, and distances himself from the business by making a film and trying to become a Hollywood screenwriter. Christopher struggles throughout the series with major drug and alcohol addictions and repeatedly spends time at AA and drug rehabilitation centers. Despite wanting Christopher to succeed, Tony doubts his nephew's loyalty and suitability to be his successor, and he fears that Christopher's immaturity and frequent drug problems make him a ripe target to turn state's evidence. Christopher's efforts to stay clean of drugs and alcohol cause him to spend less time at their regular haunts further arousing Tony's suspicions. Christopher causes a car crash as he is driving Tony home while high. After seeing that Caitlyn's baby seat has been completely destroyed in the accident, Tony suffocates the injured Chris and is finally rid of his troublesome nephew. ==Biography== Christopher Moltisanti is born in 1969 to Richard \\"Dickie\\" Moltisanti, a soldier in the DiMeo crime family, and Joanne Blundetto. In the episode \\"Cold Cuts\\" it is revealed that Chris grew up in Rochelle Park, New Jersey section of Paramus, New Jersey next to the Westfield Garden State Plaza. When talking about his childhood with his cousin Tony Blundetto he describes himself as an urban youth, something Blundetto disagrees with. When discussing making a biographical movie of Joe Gallo with Jon Favreau, Moltisanti mentions that he vaguely remembered Gallo being murdered in 1972, as he was only a kid (3 years old). Dickie is killed when Chris is very young. Tony Soprano affectionately considers Christopher a \\"nephew\\", and looks out for him over the years. Moltisanti dropped out of high school in the 9th grade. He is a fan of the television show Cops. Moltisanti is a roommate of Brendan Filone before his murder and engaged to Adriana La Cerva before her murder. Chris is a cousin once removed of Tony's wife Carmela. ===Season one=== Christopher begins the series as Tony's driver and enforcer, and is eager to rise through the ranks in the Mafia. He \\"makes his bones\\" by killing Emil Kolar in order to settle a dispute with the DiMeo crime family over the Triborough Towers garbage routes. He initially plans to place the body in a Kolar Bros. dumpster to send a warning, but Salvatore \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero convinces him to put it elsewhere as it would bring less heat to the crew. The murder haunts Chris' dreams, and he twice has to dig up and move Kolar's corpse. Chris aids Brendan in hijacking Comley trucks, which are under Junior Soprano's protection. The two are ordered to pay $15,000 in restitution to Junior and leave the trucks alone. Chris and Brendan plan another heist while high on methamphetamine, but Chris backs down at the last minute out of loyalty to Tony. Brendan and two others go through with the heist, which ends in the accidental death of the driver. Chris is reprimanded by Tony for not using his leadership to stop Brendan. Junior, angered that his authority was flouted, stages a mock execution for Chris in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Brendan is shot in the eye by Mikey Palmice. Christopher later avenges Brendan's death when he and Paulie ambush and murder Mikey out in the woods. ===Season two=== Chris is put in charge of the family's pump and dump scam, with Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte serving as his subordinates. Eventually, Bevilaqua and Gismonte decide to murder him to gain favor with Richie Aprile. The pair ambush Chris outside a diner and badly wound him, but he manages to kill Gismonte as Bevilaqua flees the scene. When Chris recovers from a coma, his spleen is removed and goes through a traumatic recovery process, having been clinically dead for about a minute. Bevilaqua is eventually tracked down and shot to death by Tony and Big Pussy. Chris tells the crew that during his coma, he had seen himself in either hell or purgatory and warned them that Brendan and Mikey told him that three o'clock would be a significant time in their future. Shortly before the shooting, Chris and Adriana had gotten into a fight and she moved in with her mother, but Chris gets her back by proposing to her, against her mother's advice. Despite this, the two do not get married. Following Aprile's death, Tony calls Chris and Furio Giunta to dispose of his body; they use Satriale's bandsaw and processing room to dismember the corpse. At Meadow Soprano's graduation, Tony proposes to let Chris be made. ===Season three=== During Chris' initiation ceremony, in \\"Fortunate Son\\", he notices a raven on the windowsill and takes this as a bad omen. As the family's newest member, he inherits a betting shop from his capo, Paulie Gualtieri and is charged with paying minimum weekly dues to him. There is friction when Chris has difficulty making payments to Paulie, who subsequently humiliates him. However, after the Pine Barrens incident, they agreed to bury the hatchet. Elsewhere, Chris opens the Crazy Horse Nightclub in Long Branch with Furio Giunta as a partner and Adriana as front operator. Chris is present when Jackie Aprile, Jr. and his friends try to rob a card game run by Eugene Pontecorvo. Chris and acting capo Albert Barese kill Aprile's friend Dino Zerilli as he tries to escape. Chris, jealous and resentful of Jackie as a rival for Tony's favor, expresses his intent to kill Jackie, saying if he finds him he'll kill him tonight, which Tony denies. This causes Chris to question Tony's leadership, calling him a hypocrite for not enforcing established rules of the mob protecting made men, which enrages Tony. Eventually, Vito Spatafore carries out a contract killing on Jackie in the Boonton Projects, shooting Aprile in the back of the head, on the orders of Ralph Cifaretto and Tony Soprano. At Jackie's funeral, Chris is arrested on a gambling charge along with Patsy Parisi and Silvio Dante. ===Season four=== To protect himself from prosecution, Tony makes Chris the main contact in criminal dealings. He then bonds his nephew to him by having him murder Lieutenant Detective Barry Haydu, after telling Chris that Haydu had murdered his father. Christopher confronts Haydu at his home and he denies having heard of Dickie Moltisanti and claimed that someone was \\"obviously\\" setting him up; however, he inadvertently admitted knowing Dickie Moltisanti by stating \\"Look, whoever told you I had anything to do with his death is lying!\\", before Christopher ever mentioned Dickie's death, whom Haydu supposedly did not even know. Haydu's last words before he is killed by Christopher are \\"I'm sorry!\\" indicating that he was likely indeed responsible. Chris is later made acting capo when Paulie is imprisoned on a gun charge and is awarded a no-show job at the Esplanade construction site. His promotion irks Patsy, who has seniority. The two come to blows over Patsy's continued theft from the construction site, despite orders from Tony. Silvio was actually the guiding force behind Patsy's actions, as he was also jealous of Chris' promotion. Chris' drug use spirals out of control following his temporary promotion. When Tony calls upon him to dispose of Ralph Cifaretto's body, he realizes that Chris is high on heroin. Although they successfully hide the body, Tony decides his nephew needs help. Later, Chris is carjacked by a Puerto Rican gang while trying to buy heroin. When Chris physically abuses Adriana, Tony organizes an intervention. However, the meeting ends badly when it is revealed that Chris had accidentally killed Adriana's dog by sitting on it when high. Tony, whose beloved race horse was killed in a fire set by Ralph, becomes very angry. He insists Chris go into rehab and assigns Patsy to guard him. Following Chris' successful rehabilitation, Tony entrusts him with the planned hit on Carmine Lupertazzi; Chris contracts the job out to Credenzo Curtis and Stanley Johnson, Black gang members and drug dealers who he had known from his period of heroin abuse. When the job is called off and Tony urges him to make sure it can't be traced to them, Chris has Benny Fazio and Peter \\"Bissell\\" LaRosa shoot Curtis and Johnson to death while he waits in his car watching over the hit. Fazio and La Rosa steal back the money Chris had given Curtis and Johnson, which they believed was payment for the hit they were tasked with. ===Season five=== Chris and Paulie are put in charge of a cigarette smuggling operation. While Chris is traveling to North Carolina to pick up cigarettes, Tony and Adriana are involved in a car accident. Rumors begin to spread that the crash was caused by Adriana performing oral sex on Tony. Chris finds out, gets drunk, starts a fight with Vito, and pulls a gun on Tony in the Bada Bing. Tony is prepared to kill Chris, but their cousin Tony Blundetto steps in and saves his life. Tony B arranges a meeting with a doctor who treated Tony and Adriana, who explains that both passengers were upright and had their seat belts fastened when it occurred. Chris reconciles with Vito and Tony. Chris later travels to his uncle Pat Blundetto's farm alongside Tony and Tony B. They help Pat move bodies hidden on the farm as Pat is planning to move away. While there, Chris recalls being bullied by the two Tonys, and they exhibit such behavior by ribbing him over his addiction problems. Throughout this time, Chris maintains a turbulent and sometimes violent relationship with Adriana. He indulged her aspirations for a career in music by allowing her to produce a demo and later giving her a club to run. They became engaged before he is sent to rehab. However, after he learns that Adriana has reluctantly provided information to the FBI, he turns to Tony rather than accept her plea to join her in witness protection. Tony sends Silvio Dante to meet with Adriana, purportedly to drive to the hospital to visit Chris, but in reality he executes her in the woods. Chris relapses into heroin use and weeps to Tony out of grief for Adriana. ===Season six=== Part one Chris is promoted to capo, in keeping with Tony's long term plan to raise his nephew through the ranks until he eventually is appointed boss. He uses Chris to organize a sensitive hit on Rusty Millio. Chris initially questions Tony's decision to contract the job out to their friends in Naples, but later decides it was a smart move. He uses his Italian-speaking associate Corky Caporale to communicate with hitmen and provide them with weapons and instructions, while paying him off with heroin. Chris' readiness for the responsibility of leading his own crew is unclear as he is distracted by a potential career in Hollywood, has relapsed into drug use, and displays unresolved feelings over his murdered fiancee. Chris' crew get involved in a credit card fraud scam; his AA sponsor James \\"Murmur\\" Zancone and Benny Fazio take numbers from local businesses and sell them on to associates Ahmed and Muhammad. He wonders about whether these men have links to terrorism. The use of numbers from Nuovo Vesuvio leads to a violent dispute between Benny and Tony's friend Artie Bucco. Tony blames Chris' trip to Los Angeles for the dispute not being settled quickly. Chris marries Kelli Lombardo after learning that she is pregnant with his child. He has a belated bachelor party with the Soprano crime family at Nuovo Vesuvio, where \\"Larry Boy\\" Barese makes a toast to his future. However, when he later delivers Corky's final payment, including more heroin, he cannot resist when he watches his friend inject the drug. He spends the night at the Feast of St. Elzear festival with a stray dog. Chris takes a road trip to Pennsylvania with Tony just before the feast. On their way home, they spot some bikers robbing a strip mall and take part of the haul for themselves. This leads to a firefight in which Chris shoots one of the bikers as Tony drives away. Later, the two get drunk on the wine they had stolen, and Chris recalls telling Tony of Adriana's treachery. The two express their love for and loyalty to each other, though when the two later try to recreate their camaraderie sober, it falls flat and ends in an awkward silence. Months later, Chris is back in AA meetings. Part two Chris premieres his film Cleaver at a private screening with other Soprano associates, looking to having it distributed nationwide. He also tries to distance himself from the criminal lifestyle and stays away from the Bada Bing. When Tony begins grooming Bobby Bacala for the position Chris once held, it is clear that their relationship has cooled. Given Chris' resentment towards Tony about Adriana's death, and his continued desire to enter the film business, the two continue to drift apart. When he relapses to drinking after yet another confrontation with Paulie, he becomes very angry with the crew and leaves. He later ends up at his \\"friend\\" J.T. Dolan's home, looking for someone to talk to. When J.T. foolishly makes explicit mention of Chris' membership in the Mafia, and refuses to let Chris talk out his problems that night, Chris shoots him in the head and leaves. As Tony and Chris drive back from a meeting with Phil Leotardo and the New York crew, Chris clearly impaired by drugs and alcohol crashes his Cadillac Escalade. Tony is able to climb out of the SUV, but Chris is badly injured and coughing up blood. He pleads for Tony's help, mumbling that he wouldn't pass a drug test and could lose his license. Tony sees a tree branch impaling a car seat where Christopher's daughter could have been sitting. He pinches Chris' nostrils shut, causing him to choke to death on his own blood. Throughout the episode's remainder, Tony displays the proper decorum for the family in mourning yet can barely restrain his relief that he is finally free of the burden Chris has placed upon him for so long his insubordination, his substance abuse, his reckless behavior, and his complaints. He describes Chris as a \\"drag\\" on his emotions, and \\"a weak, lying drug addict\\". In a dream, Tony admits to Dr. Melfi that he murdered Chris, as well as other friends and associates, naming specifically his cousin Tony Blundetto and best friend Big Pussy. In the series' final episodes, Chris' picture is hung in the pork store in his honor; Paulie is disturbed that the resident cat spends its days staring at the picture. === Clandestine knowledge === Because of his close relationship with Tony Soprano, Christopher is the only one (besides Tony) who knows which bodies were buried at \\"Uncle Pat\\" Blundetto's farm and what really happened to Ralph Cifaretto. Chris is also one of the few (along with Furio Giunta) to know Richie Aprile was murdered by Janice Soprano, and (along with Silvio Dante) to know about Tony Soprano's murder of Fabian Petrulio, about the aborted plan to hit New York boss Carmine Lupertazzi, Sr. and about Silvio's murder of Christopher's fiancee, Adriana La Cerva. == Killings or possible killings committed or assisted by Christopher == * Emil Kolar: Shot in the head by Chris due to a dispute between Barone Sanitation (Tony's company) and Kolar Bros.

When Johnny comes to an agreement with Carmine and calls off the hit, Christopher is given the new task of eliminating the two hired hands. He meets with the hitmen in a parking lot and gives them the money for the hit that never happened. Benny Fazio and Petey LaRosa surprise the two hitmen when they suddenly appear, and shoot and kill them in their car. (2002) * Raoul: Christopher threw a brick at him and then Paulie shot him.

(2004) * Adriana La Cerva: Once she confessed to Christopher that she had been an FBI informant, divulging important information about the DiMeo crime family Christopher's loyalty to Tony proved to be greater than his love for Adriana. While he did not directly participate in the hit (that distinction went to Silvio Dante.

(2006) == References to Imperioli's career == * in the episode \\"46 Long\\", Christopher and Brendan Filone encounter Martin Scorsese (portrayed by a lookalike) outside of a club. Christopher yells \\"Marty! Kundun! I liked it!\\". Imperioli acted in Scorsese's gangster film Goodfellas in a minor role, \\"Spider\\". * In Season 1 Moltisanti shoots a bakery clerk in the foot in retaliation for a perceived lack of respect and service — a nod to Imperioli's Goodfellas character Spider, shot in the foot for the same reason. When the bakery clerk was yelling in pain about his foot being shot, Christopher replies \\"It happens!\\" * In reference to his Goodfellas character, Spider, being shot and killed by Joe Pesci's character, Tommy DeVito. In season 2 episode, \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\", when Christopher gets his confidence up as a student actor, Adriana tells him \\"I like you as an actor.\\" and Christopher replies \\"Joe Pesci or so.\\", he then does a Joe Pesci impression of him saying a line in Jimmy Hollywood. * In the episode \\"Live Free or Die\\", after it is confirmed that Vito Spatafore is gay, Christopher states \\"I wanna kill the fat faggot myself, it'd be a fucking honor. Cut off his pisciatil' and feed it to him.\\" This is a reference to Imperioli's character d'Ambrosio in the film Dead Presidents having exactly the same thing done to him by the North Vietnamese. Pisciatil' is slang connotation for penis. == Reception == TV Guide rated him #13 on their list of \\"TV's Top 100 Characters\\". == Notes == == References == ==External links== * HBO Profile: Christopher Moltisanti * IMDB: Christopher Moltisanti Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Fictional heroin users Category:Fictional domestic abusers Category:Fictional methamphetamine users Category:Fictional smokers Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional writers Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Christopher Moltisanti ","title":"Christopher Moltisanti"},{"id":"515929","text":"Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification. Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. Naive Bayes spam filtering is a baseline technique for dealing with spam that can tailor itself to the email needs of individual users and give low false positive spam detection rates that are generally acceptable to users. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s. ==History== Bayesian algorithms were used to sort and filter email by 1996. Although naive Bayesian filters did not become popular until later, multiple programs were released in 1998 to address the growing problem of unwanted email. The first scholarly publication on Bayesian spam filtering was by Sahami et al. in 1998. That work was soon thereafter deployed in commercial spam filters. However, in 2002 Paul Graham greatly decreased the false positive rate, so that it could be used on its own as a single spam filter.Paul Graham (2003), Better Bayesian filtering Brian Livingston (2002), Paul Graham provides stunning answer to spam e-mails Variants of the basic technique have been implemented in a number of research works and commercial software products. Many modern mail clients implement Bayesian spam filtering. Users can also install separate email filtering programs. Server-side email filters, such as DSPAM, SpamAssassin, SpamBayes, Bogofilter and ASSP, make use of Bayesian spam filtering techniques, and the functionality is sometimes embedded within mail server software itself. CRM114, oft cited as a Bayesian filter, is not intended to use a Bayes filter in production, but includes the ″unigram″ feature for reference. ==Process== Particular words have particular probabilities of occurring in spam email and in legitimate email. For instance, most email users will frequently encounter the word \\"Viagra\\" in spam email, but will seldom see it in other email. The filter doesn't know these probabilities in advance, and must first be trained so it can build them up. To train the filter, the user must manually indicate whether a new email is spam or not. For all words in each training email, the filter will adjust the probabilities that each word will appear in spam or legitimate email in its database. For instance, Bayesian spam filters will typically have learned a very high spam probability for the words \\"Viagra\\" and \\"refinance\\", but a very low spam probability for words seen only in legitimate email, such as the names of friends and family members. After training, the word probabilities (also known as likelihood functions) are used to compute the probability that an email with a particular set of words in it belongs to either category. Each word in the email contributes to the email's spam probability, or only the most interesting words. This contribution is called the posterior probability and is computed using Bayes' theorem. Then, the email's spam probability is computed over all words in the email, and if the total exceeds a certain threshold (say 95%), the filter will mark the email as a spam. As in any other spam filtering technique, email marked as spam can then be automatically moved to a \\"Junk\\" email folder, or even deleted outright. Some software implement quarantine mechanisms that define a time frame during which the user is allowed to review the software's decision. The initial training can usually be refined when wrong judgements from the software are identified (false positives or false negatives). That allows the software to dynamically adapt to the ever-evolving nature of spam. Some spam filters combine the results of both Bayesian spam filtering and other heuristics (pre-defined rules about the contents, looking at the message's envelope, etc.), resulting in even higher filtering accuracy, sometimes at the cost of adaptiveness. ==Mathematical foundation== Bayesian email filters utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used several times in the context of spam: * a first time, to compute the probability that the message is spam, knowing that a given word appears in this message; * a second time, to compute the probability that the message is spam, taking into consideration all of its words (or a relevant subset of them); * sometimes a third time, to deal with rare words. ===Computing the probability that a message containing a given word is spam=== Let's suppose the suspected message contains the word \\"replica\\". Most people who are used to receiving e-mail know that this message is likely to be spam, more precisely a proposal to sell counterfeit copies of well-known brands of watches. The spam detection software, however, does not \\"know\\" such facts; all it can do is compute probabilities. The formula used by the software to determine that, is derived from Bayes' theorem :\\\\Pr(SW) = \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(WS) \\\\cdot \\\\Pr(S)}{\\\\Pr(WS) \\\\cdot \\\\Pr(S) + \\\\Pr(WH) \\\\cdot \\\\Pr(H)} where: * \\\\Pr(SW) is the probability that a message is a spam, knowing that the word \\"replica\\" is in it; * \\\\Pr(S) is the overall probability that any given message is spam; * \\\\Pr(WS) is the probability that the word \\"replica\\" appears in spam messages; * \\\\Pr(H) is the overall probability that any given message is not spam (is \\"ham\\"); * \\\\Pr(WH) is the probability that the word \\"replica\\" appears in ham messages. (For a full demonstration, see Bayes' theorem#Extended form.) ===The spamliness of a word=== Statistics show that the current probability of any message being spam is 80%, at the very least: : \\\\Pr(S) = 0.8 ; \\\\Pr(H) = 0.2 However, most bayesian spam detection software makes the assumption that there is no a priori reason for any incoming message to be spam rather than ham, and considers both cases to have equal probabilities of 50%: : \\\\Pr(S) = 0.5 ; \\\\Pr(H) = 0.5 The filters that use this hypothesis are said to be \\"not biased\\", meaning that they have no prejudice regarding the incoming email. This assumption permits simplifying the general formula to: :\\\\Pr(SW) = \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(WS)}{\\\\Pr(WS) + \\\\Pr(WH)} This is functionally equivalent to asking, \\"what percentage of occurrences of the word \\"replica\\" appear in spam messages?\\" This quantity is called \\"spamicity\\" (or \\"spaminess\\") of the word \\"replica\\", and can be computed. The number \\\\Pr(WS) used in this formula is approximated to the frequency of messages containing \\"replica\\" in the messages identified as spam during the learning phase. Similarly, \\\\Pr(WH) is approximated to the frequency of messages containing \\"replica\\" in the messages identified as ham during the learning phase. For these approximations to make sense, the set of learned messages needs to be big and representative enough. It is also advisable that the learned set of messages conforms to the 50% hypothesis about repartition between spam and ham, i.e. that the datasets of spam and ham are of same size.Process Software, Introduction to Bayesian Filtering Of course, determining whether a message is spam or ham based only on the presence of the word \\"replica\\" is error- prone, which is why bayesian spam software tries to consider several words and combine their spamicities to determine a message's overall probability of being spam. ===Combining individual probabilities=== Most bayesian spam filtering algorithms are based on formulas that are strictly valid (from a probabilistic standpoint) only if the words present in the message are independent events. This condition is not generally satisfied (for example, in natural languages like English the probability of finding an adjective is affected by the probability of having a noun), but it is a useful idealization, especially since the statistical correlations between individual words are usually not known. On this basis, one can derive the following formula from Bayes' theorem: at MathPages :p = \\\\frac{p_1 p_2 \\\\cdots p_N}{p_1 p_2 \\\\cdots p_N + (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2) \\\\cdots (1 - p_N)} where: * p is the probability that the suspect message is spam; * p_1 is the probability p(SW_1) that it is a spam knowing it contains a first word (for example \\"replica\\"); * p_2 is the probability p(SW_2) that it is a spam knowing it contains a second word (for example \\"watches\\"); * etc... * p_N is the probability p(SW_N) that it is a spam knowing it contains an Nth word (for example \\"home\\"). This is the formula referenced by Paul Graham in his August 2002 article. Some early commentators stated that \\"Graham pulled his formulas out of thin air\\",http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python- dev/2002-August/028216.html Tim Peter's comment on the algorithm used by Graham but Graham had actually referenced his source, which included a detailed explanation of the formula, and the idealizations on which it is based. Spam filtering software based on this formula is sometimes referred to as a naive Bayes classifier, as \\"naive\\" refers to the strong independence assumptions between the features. The result p is typically compared to a given threshold to decide whether the message is spam or not. If p is lower than the threshold, the message is considered as likely ham, otherwise it is considered as likely spam. ===Other expression of the formula for combining individual probabilities=== Usually p is not directly computed using the above formula due to floating-point underflow. Instead, p can be computed in the log domain by rewriting the original equation as follows: : \\\\frac{1}{p} - 1 = \\\\frac{(1-p_1)(1-p_2)\\\\dots(1-p_N)}{p_1 p_2 \\\\dots p_N} Taking logs on both sides: : \\\\ln \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{p} - 1 \\\\right ) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left[ \\\\ln(1-p_i) - \\\\ln p_i \\\\right] Let \\\\eta = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left[ \\\\ln(1-p_i) -\\\\ln p_i \\\\right] . Therefore, : \\\\frac{1}{p} - 1 = e^\\\\eta Hence the alternate formula for computing the combined probability: : p = \\\\frac{1}{1 + e^\\\\eta} ===Dealing with rare words=== In the case a word has never been met during the learning phase, both the numerator and the denominator are equal to zero, both in the general formula and in the spamicity formula. The software can decide to discard such words for which there is no information available. More generally, the words that were encountered only a few times during the learning phase cause a problem, because it would be an error to trust blindly the information they provide. A simple solution is to simply avoid taking such unreliable words into account as well. Applying again Bayes' theorem, and assuming the classification between spam and ham of the emails containing a given word (\\"replica\\") is a random variable with beta distribution, some programs decide to use a corrected probability: :\\\\Pr'(SW) = \\\\frac{s \\\\cdot \\\\Pr(S) + n \\\\cdot \\\\Pr(SW)}{s + n } where: *\\\\Pr'(SW) is the corrected probability for the message to be spam, knowing that it contains a given word ; * s is the strength we give to background information about incoming spam ; * \\\\Pr(S) is the probability of any incoming message to be spam ; * n is the number of occurrences of this word during the learning phase ; * \\\\Pr(SW) is the spamicity of this word. (Demonstration:) This corrected probability is used instead of the spamicity in the combining formula. \\\\Pr(S) can again be taken equal to 0.5, to avoid being too suspicious about incoming email. 3 is a good value for s, meaning that the learned corpus must contain more than 3 messages with that word to put more confidence in the spamicity value than in the default value. This formula can be extended to the case where n is equal to zero (and where the spamicity is not defined), and evaluates in this case to Pr(S). ===Other heuristics=== \\"Neutral\\" words like \\"the\\", \\"a\\", \\"some\\", or \\"is\\" (in English), or their equivalents in other languages, can be ignored. More generally, some bayesian filtering filters simply ignore all the words which have a spamicity next to 0.5, as they contribute little to a good decision. The words taken into consideration are those whose spamicity is next to 0.0 (distinctive signs of legitimate messages), or next to 1.0 (distinctive signs of spam). A method can be for example to keep only those ten words, in the examined message, which have the greatest absolute value 0.5 − pI. Some software products take into account the fact that a given word appears several times in the examined message, others don't. Some software products use patterns (sequences of words) instead of isolated natural languages words. For example, with a \\"context window\\" of four words, they compute the spamicity of \\"Viagra is good for\\", instead of computing the spamicities of \\"Viagra\\", \\"is\\", \\"good\\", and \\"for\\". This method gives more sensitivity to context and eliminates the Bayesian noise better, at the expense of a bigger database. ===Mixed methods=== There are other ways of combining individual probabilities for different words than using the \\"naive\\" approach. These methods differ from it on the assumptions they make on the statistical properties of the input data. These different hypotheses result in radically different formulas for combining the individual probabilities. For example, assuming the individual probabilities follow a chi-squared distribution with 2N degrees of freedom, one could use the formula: :p = C^{-1}(-2 \\\\ln(p_1 p_2 \\\\cdots p_N), 2N) \\\\, where C−1 is the inverse of the chi-squared function. Individual probabilities can be combined with the techniques of the Markovian discrimination too. ==DiscussionAdvantages=== One of the main advantages of Bayesian spam filtering is that it can be trained on a per-user basis. The spam that a user receives is often related to the online user's activities. For example, a user may have been subscribed to an online newsletter that the user considers to be spam. This online newsletter is likely to contain words that are common to all newsletters, such as the name of the newsletter and its originating email address. A Bayesian spam filter will eventually assign a higher probability based on the user's specific patterns. The legitimate e-mails a user receives will tend to be different. For example, in a corporate environment, the company name and the names of clients or customers will be mentioned often. The filter will assign a lower spam probability to emails containing those names. The word probabilities are unique to each user and can evolve over time with corrective training whenever the filter incorrectly classifies an email. As a result, Bayesian spam filtering accuracy after training is often superior to pre-defined rules. It can perform particularly well in avoiding false positives, where legitimate email is incorrectly classified as spam. For example, if the email contains the word \\"Nigeria\\", which is frequently used in Advance fee fraud spam, a pre-defined rules filter might reject it outright. A Bayesian filter would mark the word \\"Nigeria\\" as a probable spam word, but would take into account other important words that usually indicate legitimate e-mail. For example, the name of a spouse may strongly indicate the e-mail is not spam, which could overcome the use of the word \\"Nigeria.\\" ===Disadvantages=== Depending on the implementation, Bayesian spam filtering may be susceptible to Bayesian poisoning, a technique used by spammers in an attempt to degrade the effectiveness of spam filters that rely on Bayesian filtering. A spammer practicing Bayesian poisoning will send out emails with large amounts of legitimate text (gathered from legitimate news or literary sources). Spammer tactics include insertion of random innocuous words that are not normally associated with spam, thereby decreasing the email's spam score, making it more likely to slip past a Bayesian spam filter. However, with (for example) Paul Graham's scheme only the most significant probabilities are used, so that padding the text out with non-spam-related words does not affect the detection probability significantly. Words that normally appear in large quantities in spam may also be transformed by spammers. For example, «Viagra» would be replaced with «Viaagra» or «V!agra» in the spam message. The recipient of the message can still read the changed words, but each of these words is met more rarely by the Bayesian filter, which hinders its learning process. As a general rule, this spamming technique does not work very well, because the derived words end up recognized by the filter just like the normal ones.Paul Graham (2002), A Plan for Spam Another technique used to try to defeat Bayesian spam filters is to replace text with pictures, either directly included or linked. The whole text of the message, or some part of it, is replaced with a picture where the same text is \\"drawn\\". The spam filter is usually unable to analyze this picture, which would contain the sensitive words like «Viagra». However, since many mail clients disable the display of linked pictures for security reasons, the spammer sending links to distant pictures might reach fewer targets. Also, a picture's size in bytes is bigger than the equivalent text's size, so the spammer needs more bandwidth to send messages directly including pictures. Some filters are more inclined to decide that a message is spam if it has mostly graphical contents. A solution used by Google in its Gmail email system is to perform an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on every mid to large size image, analyzing the text inside. ==General applications of Bayesian filtering== While Bayesian filtering is used widely to identify spam email, the technique can classify (or \\"cluster\\") almost any sort of data. It has uses in science, medicine, and engineering. One example is a general purpose classification program called AutoClass which was originally used to classify stars according to spectral characteristics that were otherwise too subtle to notice. ==See also== * Anti-spam techniques * Bayesian poisoning * Email filtering * Markovian discrimination * Mozilla Thunderbird mail client with native implementation of Bayes filters ==References== Category:Spam filtering Category:Bayesian estimation ","title":"Naive Bayes spam filtering"},{"id":"515931","text":"Peter Bichsel (born 24 March 1935) is a popular Swiss writer and journalist representing modern German literature. He was a member of the Gruppe Olten. Bichsel was born 1935 in Lucerne, Switzerland, the son of manual labourers. Shortly after he was born, the Bichsels moved to Olten, also in Switzerland. After finishing school, he became an elementary school teacher, a job which he held until 1968. From 1974 to 1981 he was the personal advisor and speech writer of Willy Ritschard, a member of the Swiss Federal Council. Between 1972 and 1989 he made his mark as a \\"writer in residence\\" and a guest lecturer at American universities. Bichsel has lived on the outskirts of Solothurn for several decades. He started publishing short lyric works in newspapers. In 1960, he got his first success in prose as a private printer. In the winter of 1963-1964 he took part in writing course in prose taught by Walter Höllerer. One of his first and most well-known works is And Really Frau Blum Would Very Much Like to Meet the Milkman. Just as successful, Children's Stories, intended for adults, is written in the form of droll tales for children. Both books were translated from the German by English poet Michael Hamburger. A theme of Bichsel's works for younger readers is the stubborn desire of children to take words literally and wreak havoc on the world of communicated ideas. In the early 1970s and 1980s, Bichsel's journalistic work pushed his literary work mainly into the background. Only Der Busant (1985) and Warten in Baden-Baden appeared again with the Bichsel style that was so familiar to German readers. Peter Bichsel gave up being a professional teacher early in his lifetime, yet he has continued to teach his readers that the drudgery and banality of life is of our own making. Conversely, we have every opportunity to prevent our lives from being boring. This theme has helped make Peter Bichsel a symbol of German literary work today. In 1981, he was a member of the jury at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival. Peter Bichsel's estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern. ==Awards== Peter Bichsel´s autograph *1965 Prize of \\"Group 47\\" *1970 Deutscher Jugendbuchpreis *1981/82 Stadtschreiber von Bergen *1996 Mainzer Stadtschreiber *1999 Gottfried-Keller-Preis *2000 Prix Européen de l’Essai Charles Veillon *2000 Kassel Literary Prize *2004 Honorary Doctor of Theology, University of Basel *2005 Work grant by Pro Helvetia *2011 Solothurner Literaturpreis *2012 Grosser Schillerpreis ==Short story collections== *Versuche über Gino (1960) *Eigentlich möchte Frau Blum den Milchmann kennenlernen (1964) **And really Frau Blum would very much like to meet the milkman.

Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century.; The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158–1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or Prague Bridge (Pražský most) but has been \\"Charles Bridge\\" since 1870. As the only means of crossing the river Vltava until 1841, Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This \\"solid-land\\" connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe. The bridge is long and nearly wide, following the example of the Stone Bridge in Regensburg, it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two on the Lesser Quarter side (including the Malá Strana Bridge Tower) and one on the Old Town side, the Old Town Bridge Tower. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas. Repairs are scheduled to start in late 2019, and should take around 20 years. ==HistoryThrough the 19th century=== Old Town Bridge Tower during 1848 revolution Charles Bridge during 1872 flood Charles Bridge as viewed from Petřínská rozhledna – lookout tower Throughout its history, Charles Bridge has suffered several disasters and witnessed many historic events. Czech legend has it that construction began on Charles Bridge at 5:31am on 9 July 1357 with the first stone being laid by Charles IV himself. This exact time was very important to the Holy Roman Emperor because he was a strong believer in numerology and felt that this specific time, which formed a palindrome (1357 9, 7 5:31), was a numerical bridge, and would imbue Charles Bridge with additional strength. The bridge was completed 45 years later in 1402. A flood in 1432 damaged three pillars. In 1496 the third arch (counting from the Old Town side) broke down after one of the pillars lowered, being undermined by the water (repairs were finished in 1503). A year after the Battle of White Mountain, when the 27 leaders of the anti-Habsburg revolt were executed on 21 June 1621, the Old Town Bridge Tower served as a deterrent display of the severed heads of the victims to stop Czechs from further resistance. During the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, the Swedes occupied the west bank of the Vltava, and as they tried to advance into the Old Town the heaviest fighting took place right on the bridge. During the fighting, they severely damaged one side of the Old Town bridge tower (the side facing the river) and the remnants of almost all gothic decorations had to be removed from it afterward. During the late 17th century and early 18th century the bridge gained its typical appearance when an alley of baroque statues was installed on the pillars. During a great flood in 1784, five pillars were severely damaged and, although the arches did not break down, the traffic on the bridge had to be greatly restricted for some time. The original stairway to Kampa Island was replaced by a new one in 1844. The next year, another great flood threatened the bridge, but the bridge escaped major damage. In 1848, during the revolutionary days, the bridge escaped unharmed from the cannonade, but some of the statues were damaged. In 1866, pseudo- gothic gas lights were erected on the balustrade; they were later replaced with electric lighting. In the 1870s, the first regular public-transport (omnibus) line went over the bridge (officially called \\"Charles Bridge\\" after 1870) later replaced by a horse tram. The bridge towers underwent a thorough reconstruction between 1874 and 1883. On 2–5 September 1890, another disastrous flood struck Prague and severely damaged Charles Bridge. Thousands of rafts, logs and other floating materials that escaped from places upstream gradually formed a huge barrier leaning against the bridge. Three arches were torn down by the great pressure and two pillars collapsed from being undermined by the water, while others were partly damaged. With the fifth pillar, two statues – St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Xavier, both by Ferdinand Brokoff – also fell into the river. The former statue was replaced by a statuary of Saints Cyril and Methodius by Karel Dvořák; the latter was replaced by a replica of the original. Repair works lasted for two years (the bridge was reopened on 19 November 1892) and cost 665,000 crowns. ===20th century to present=== In the beginning of the 20th century, Charles Bridge saw a steep rise of heavy traffic. The last day of the horse line on the bridge was 15 May 1905, when it was replaced with an electric tram and later, in 1908, with buses. At the end of World War II, a barricade was built in the Old Town bridge tower gateway. A capital repair of the bridge took place between 1965 and 1978, based on a collaboration among various scientific and cultural institutes. The stability of the pillars was reassured, all broken stone blocks were replaced, and the asphalt top was removed. All vehicular traffic has been excluded from Charles Bridge since then, making it accessible by pedestrians only. The repair cost 50 million crowns. During the 1990s, some people started criticizing the previous reconstruction of the bridge and proposing further work. As of the beginning of the new millennium, most of the experts appeared to agree that the previous reconstruction had not been flawless but disputed the need for further interference with the bridge. However, after the disastrous floods of 2002 (which themselves caused only minor harm to the bridge), support for an overall bridge reconstruction grew. It was decided that repair and stabilization of the two pillars (numbers 8 and 9) on the Malá Strana side of the bridge would be done. These are the only river pillars that were not repaired after the 1890 floods. The reconstruction was a gradual process that closed off parts of the bridge without closing the span entirely. Performed from 2008 to 2010, the work included bolstering the pillars and building a new hydroisolation system protecting the bridge. It also encompassed a re-pavimentation of the bridge's pavement and the replacement of many of the stones in the bridge walls, a matter which was controversial due to a heavy-handed approach adopted by the restoration team, which had no previous experience in restoration of cultural heritage monuments. The result has been criticised by conservation professionals all over Europe (see photos on external links), as dozens of new replacement stones do not match the historical ones they are next to, the amount of replaced stones is considered excessive, some stones have been inappropriately positioned, original stones have been chipped and joining materials employed are considered not appropriate for the structure. In 2010 UNESCO's World Heritage Committee adopted a decision stating that \\"the restoration of Charles Bridge was carried out without adequate conservation advice on materials and techniques\\".Decision 34COM7B.82 Charles Bridge (Karlův most), Vltava River, Prague, 2015 ==Statues on the bridge== Charles Bridge and the Holy Crucifix, c. 1935 The avenue of 30 mostly baroque statues and statuaries situated on the balustrade forms a unique connection of artistic styles with the underlying gothic bridge. Most sculptures were erected between 1683 and 1714. They depict various saints and patron saints venerated at that time. The most prominent Bohemian sculptors of the time took part in decorating the bridge, such as Matthias Braun, Jan Brokoff, and his sons Michael Joseph and Ferdinand Maxmilian. Among the most notable sculptures, one can find the statuaries of St. Luthgard, the Holy Crucifix and Calvary, and John of Nepomuk. Well known also is the statue of the knight Bruncvík, although it was erected some 200 years later and does not belong to the main avenue. Beginning in 1965, all of the statues have been systematically replaced by replicas, and the originals have been exhibited in the Lapidarium of the National Museum. ==Tribute== On July 9, 2017, Google celebrated the 660th anniversary of Charles Bridge with a Google Doodle. ==ReferencesOfficial Museum of Charles Bridge * Category:Peter Parler buildings Category:Bridges completed in 1402 Category:Bridges in Prague Category:Bridges over the Vltava Category:Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor Category:Gothic architecture in the Czech Republic Category:National Cultural Monuments of the Czech Republic Category:Pedestrian bridges in the Czech Republic Category:Tourist attractions in Prague ","title":"Charles Bridge"},{"id":"515939","text":"Interior of the Temple maçonnique des Amis philanthropes in Brussels, Belgium Masonic lodge in Mons, Belgium Egyptian Revival is an architectural style that uses the motifs and imagery of ancient Egypt. It is attributed generally to the public awareness of ancient Egyptian monuments generated by Napoleon's conquest of Egypt and Admiral Nelson's defeat of the French Navy at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Napoleon took a scientific expedition with him to Egypt. Publication of the expedition's work, the Description de l'Égypte, began in 1809 and was published as a series through 1826. The size and monumentality of the façades \\"discovered\\" during his adventure cemented the hold of Egyptian aesthetics on the Parisian elite. However, works of art and architecture (such as funerary monuments) in the Egyptian style had been made or built occasionally on the European continent and the British Isles since the time of the Renaissance. ==HistoryEgyptian influence before Napoleon=== The most important example is probably the Obelisk of Domitian, erected in 1651 by Bernini on top of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi in Piazza Navona, Rome. It influenced the obelisk constructed as a family funeral memorial by Sir Edward Lovatt Pierce for the Allen family at Stillorgan in Ireland in 1717, one of several Egyptian obelisks erected in Ireland during the early 18th century. Others may be found at Belan, County Kildare; and Dangan, County Meath. The Casteltown Folly in County Kildare is probably the best known, albeit the least Egyptian-styled. Egyptian buildings had also been built as garden follies. The most elaborate was probably the one built by Frederick I, Duke of Württemberg in the gardens of the Château de Montbéliard. It included an Egyptian bridge across which guests walked to reach an island with an elaborate Egyptian-influenced bath house. Designed by the duke's court architect, Jean Baptiste Kleber, the building had a billiards room and a bagnio. ===Post-Napoleonic era=== Egyptian Gate (1827–30) in Tsarskoe Selo (St. Petersburg, Russia) New after the Napoleonic invasion was a sudden increase of the number of works of art and the fact that, for the first time, entire buildings began to be built to resemble those of ancient Egypt. In France and Britain this was at least partially inspired by successful war campaigns undertaken by each country while in Egypt. Foire du Caire building (1828), from Paris, the earliest manifestation of Egyptian Revivalism: façade adorned with heads of the Egyptian goddess Hathor According to David Brownlee, the 1798 Karlsruhe Synagogue, an early building by the influential Friedrich Weinbrenner was \\"the first large Egyptian building to be erected since antiquity.\\"David Brownlee, Frederich Weinbrenner: Architect of Karlsruhe, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986. p. 92. According to Diana Muir Appelbaum, it was \\"the first public building (that is, not a folly, stage set, or funeral monument) in the Egyptian revival style.\\"Diana Muir Appelbaum, \\"Jewish Identity and Egyptian Revival Architecture\\", Journal of Jewish Identities, 2012, 5(2) p. 7. The ancient Egyptian influence was mainly shown in the two large engaged pylons flanking the entrance; otherwise the windows and entrance of the central section were pointed arches, and the overall plan conventional, with Neo-Gothic details. Among the earliest monuments of the Egyptian Revival in Paris is the Fontaine du Fellah, built in 1806. It was designed by François-Jean Bralle. A well-documented example, destroyed after Napoleon was deposed, was the monument to General Louis Desaix in the Place des Victoires was built in 1810. It featured a nude statue of the general and an obelisk, both set upon an Egyptian Revival base. Another example of a still standing site of Egyptian Revival is the Egyptian Gate of Tsarskoe Selo, built in 1829. A street or passage named the Place du Caire or Foire du Caire (Fair of Cairo) was built in Paris in 1798 on the former site of the convent of the \\"Filles de la Charité\\". No. 2 Place du Caire, from 1828, is essentially in overall form a conventional Parisian structure with shops on the ground floor and apartments above, but with considerable Egyptianizing decoration including a row of massive Hathor heads and a frieze by sculptor J. G. Garraud.James Stevens Curl, The Egyptian Revival, Routledge/* Post-Napoleonic era */ , London, 2005. p. 267. One of the first British buildings to show an Egyptian Revival interior was the newspaper office of the Courier on the Strand in London. It was built in 1804 and featured a cavetto (coved) cornice and Egyptian-influenced columns with palmiform capitals.Egyptomania: Egypt in Western Art, 1730–1930, Jean-Marcel Humbert, Michael Pantazzi and Christiane Ziegler, 1994, pp. 172–3 Other early British examples include the Egyptian Hall in London, completed in 1812, and the Egyptian Gallery, a private room in the home of connoisseur Thomas Hope to display his Egyptian antiquities, and illustrated in engravings from his meticulous line drawings in his book Household Furniture (1807), were a prime source for the Regency style of British furnishings. ===Later revivals=== 4th Precinct Police Station (1836) in New Orleans Egyptian Revival architecture enjoyed considerable popularity in other countries as well. The first Egyptian Revival building in the United States was the 1824 synagogue building of Congregation Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaDiana Muir Appelbaum, \\"Jewish Identity and Egyptian Revival Architecture\\", Journal of Jewish Identities, 2012 5(2) It was followed by a series of major public buildings in the first half of the 19th century including the 1835 Philadelphia County Prison, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, the 1836 Fourth District Police Station in New Orleans and the 1838 New York City jail known as the Tombs. Other public buildings in Egyptian style included the 1844 Old Whaler's Church in Sag Harbor, New York, the 1846 First Baptist Church in Essex, Connecticut, the 1845 Egyptian Building of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond and the 1848 United States Custom House in New Orleans. The most notable Egyptian structure in the United States was the Washington Monument, begun in 1848, this obelisk originally featured doors with cavetto cornices and winged sun disks, later removed. The National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri is another example of Egyptian revival architecture and art. The Tombs (1838) in New York City Entrance to Egyptian Avenue and the Lebanon Circle of Highgate Cemetery (1838–39), London Egyptian Building of the Medical College of Virginia (1845), Richmond, Virginia The York Street Synagogue (1878) in Sydney Krasnoyarsk regional museum.

The York Street Synagogue was Australia's first Egyptian revival building, followed by the Hobart Synagogue, the Launceston Synagogue and the Adelaide Hebrew Congregation, all by 1850. The earliest obelisk in Australia was erected at Macquarie Place, Sydney in 1818.Humbert, Jean-Marcel and Price, Clifford, eds., Imhotep Today: Egyptianizing Architecture, UCL Prewss, 2003, pp. 167 ff. The expeditions that eventually led to the discovery in 1922 of the treasure of Tutankhamun's's tomb by archaeologist Howard Carter resulted in a 20th-century revival. The revival during the 1920s is sometimes considered to be part of the Art Deco style. This phase gave birth to the Egyptian theatre movement, largely confined to the United States. The Egyptian Revival decorative arts style was present in furniture and other household objects, as well as in architecture. ==List of buildings== * 18–12 BC Pyramid of Cestius, Rome * 1798 Karlsruhe Synagogue * circa 1820: Memorial to Elizabeth Donkin, Port Elizabeth, South Africa. * 1822: Egyptian temple in Łazienki Park, Warsaw, Poland * 1824: 42 Fore Street in Hertford, known locally as the Egyptian House, is an English Heritage Grade II listed building built on the site of a former inn.Historic England A grocery store from the Victorian era until the 1960s, now a restaurant.Egytpian House, Hertford * 1824: Congregation Mikveh Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

After being educated at the Adams' Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire and at Christ Church, Oxford, he took orders in 1832, became chaplain of Christ Church, sublibrarian of the Bodleian, and, in 1837, assistant keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum. He was afterwards appointed select preacher to the University of Oxford, chaplain in ordinary to the queen, rector of St Margaret's, Westminster, and canon of Westminster Abbey. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and a trustee of the British Museum, and was also honored by several continental societies. For a time Cureton also served as curate of St Andrew's, Oddington, Oxfordshire. ==Works== Cureton's most remarkable work was the edition with notes and an English translation of the Epistles of Ignatius to Polycarp, the Ephesians and the Romans, from a Syriac manuscript that had been found in the monastery of St. Mary Deipara, in the desert of Nitria, near Cairo. He held that the manuscript he used gave the truest text, that all other texts were inaccurate, and that the epistles contained in the manuscript were the only genuine epistles of Ignatius that we possess, a view which received the support of Ferdinand Christian Baur, Bunsen, and many other eminent scholars, but which was opposed by Charles Wordsworth and by several German scholars, and is now generally abandoned. Cureton supported his view by his Vindiciae Ignatianae and his Corpus Ignatianum, a Complete Collection of the Ignatian Epistles, genuine, interpolated and spurious. He also edited: * a partial Syriac text of the Festal Letters of St Athanasius, which was translated into English by Henry Burgess (1854), and published in the Library of Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church; *Remains of a very Ancient Recension of the Four Gospels in Syriac, hitherto unknown in Europe; This came to be known as the Curetonian Gospels after Cureton. *Spicilegium Syriacum, containing Remains of Bardesan, Meliton, Ambrose, Mara Bar Serapion; *The third Part of the Ecclesiastical History of John, Bishop of Ephesus, which was translated by Robert Payne Smith; *Fragments of the Iliad of Homer from a Syriac Palimpsest; *an Arabic work known as the Thirty-first Chapter of the Book entitled The Lamp that guides to Salvation, written by a Christian of Tekrit; *The Book of Religious and Philosophical Sects, by Mohammed al Sharastani; *a Commentary on the Book of Lamentations, by Rabbi Tanchum; *the Pillar of the Creed of the Sunnites. Cureton also published several sermons, among which was one entitled The Doctrine of the Trinity not Speculative but Practical. After his death William Wright edited with a preface the Ancient Syriac Documents relative to the earliest Establishment of Christianity in Edessa and the neighboring Countries, from the Year of our Lords Ascension to the beginning of the Fourth Century; discovered, edited and annotated by the late W. Cureton. ==References== Category:1808 births Category:1864 deaths Category:People from Shropshire Category:Newport, Shropshire Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:English orientalists Category:Syriacists Category:19th-century English Anglican priests Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Christian Hebraists Category:Canons of Westminster Category:People educated at Adams' Grammar School ","title":"William Cureton"},{"id":"515951","text":"Hero Games (DOJ, Inc dba Hero Games) is the publisher of the Hero System, a generic roleplaying rules set that can be used to simulate many different genres, and was the co-developer of the Fuzion system. ==History== In 1981, George MacDonald and Steve Peterson, from San Mateo, California, printed 1,000 copies of a 64-page rulebook for Champions, their super-hero role-playing game, to take to a Bay Area gaming convention. It sold very strongly, enough to form a company, Hero Games. Later, the pair recruited Ray Greer as their sales and marketing partner. In the following years, the company published two more editions of Champions, two dozen adventures, and several self-contained role-playing games using the Champions core rules as a universal role-playing system: Danger International, Justice, Inc., Robot Warriors, Fantasy Hero and Star Hero. The games were very compatible, but each differed slightly, using new rules or costs. Hero Games used the term Hero System to describe them all. But ongoing production and financial troubles plagued the company, and in January 1986, Hero Games made an arrangement with Iron Crown Enterprises, publishers of Rolemaster and MERP. Initially this was only to handle the game production and distribution, leaving creative tasks to Hero Games, but in 1987 ICE also took over editorial. During this period the company was led by Rob Bell, followed by Monte Cook, and finally by Bruce Harlick. The original partners found new interests: Greer worked for Steve Jackson Games, and later he joined a Los Angeles movie special effects company run by Mark Williams, Hero Games's original artist. MacDonald became Senior Game Developer at the software company Strategic Simulations, Inc.. Peterson went to work for Electronic Arts, and then became a freelance marketing consultant and technical writer, but remained most connected with Hero Games of the original three. On April 25, 1996, ICE's role handling publishing and distribution was taken over by R. Talsorian Games, just before Iron Crown itself suffered financial difficulties in 1997. During this period, Bruce Harlick, who had been the first official hire of Hero Games in 1982, continued in his role as Line Developer. This collaboration also resulted in the Fuzion system, which was successful in itself, but an attempt to publish the Champions game under the new system as Champions: The New Millennium met mixed reviews. In 2000, Hero Games was bought by Cybergames.com, a gaming portal site which Steve Peterson was working for. Cybergames.com retained Bruce Harlick as president of their Hero Games subsidiary, but eventually decided to leave the publishing market in 2001. In December 2001, a new company called DOJ, Inc. acquired all rights to Hero Games, keeping none of the remaining original staff. DOJ, Inc., consisted of Steven S. Long (line developer), Darren Watts (president), and various support staff. It was formed specifically to acquire Hero Games. The title came from \\"Defenders of Justice\\", Watts's Champions campaign. In 2011 Darren Watts left DOJ, Inc to pursue other ventures, and warehouse manager Jason S. Walters assumed the role of CEO, acting in consultation with Steve Long and its other investors. The company now focuses on promoting stand-alone products that utilize various versions of the 6th Edition Hero System rules. ==Current PublicationsRole-playing games=== Besides the Hero System itself, Hero Games is also the publisher of genre books which supplement the generic system: Champions, a role-playing game where players can create and play superheroes; Fantasy Hero, where characters operate in a fantasy setting; Star Hero, which uses science fiction settings; Dark Champions, which simulates various forms of the action-adventure genre; and many other games. Champions, originally published as a stand-alone game in 1981, was the catalyst for the creation of the Hero System. All of the above games, as well as nearly all games published by the company, use the Hero System as their basis. While early editions included the system rules with each genre book, this ended with the Fourth Edition of Champions. Currently, the Sixth Edition of the rules is a pair of books, and the \\"genre books\\" show how to use the system to reflect the conventions of superheroic, fantasy, science fiction, and other adventure genres. Former exceptions to the \\"Hero System only\\" rule are Champions: The New Millennium and its supplements, published in the late 1990s using the Fuzion system. Recent Hero Games publications include Champions Complete, a stand-alone, moderately priced book for playing Champions, and the Monster Hunter International Employee Handbook, a stand- alone roleplaying game detailing the world of Larry Correia's Monster Hunter International. ===Expansion books=== Hero Games also published a series of \\"ultimate\\" expansion books for the Fifth Edition, which provided an additional level of detail on specific types of characters or accessories, over what was explained in more general terms in the main Hero System rules or genre books. Examples of this line included The Ultimate Martial Artist and The Ultimate Vehicle. Only one such title has been released for the Sixth Edition, The Ultimate Base, although some older titles are being revised into Hero System Core Library titles such as Hero System Martial Arts and Hero System Vehicles. ===Game settings=== Finally, the company publishes a number of game settings for its most popular genres, along with supplements to flesh those settings out. The \\"main\\" (that is, most strongly supported) setting for Champions is Millennium City; for Fantasy Hero, The Turakian Age; for Star Hero, the Terran Empire; and for Dark Champions, Hudson City. Other settings are also available for those who prefer a different \\"feel\\" than these provide. All fit into a single, universal timeline, known as the Hero Universe. All of the above are supported, to varying extents, by the Digital Hero online magazine. ===Hero Comics and Hero Graphics=== Many characters seen in the early Champions rulebooks later appeared in comic books from Hero Comics (later, Hero Graphics), and kicked off with a mini series by Eclipse Comics. Few of these characters are still used by the company, although Icestar is mentioned as a casualty from \\"The Battle of Detroit\\" in Champions Universe. Like the Villains and Vigilantes comic book mini series, the early issues printed write-up sheets allowing readers to use characters introduced in the comics in their own Champions campaigns. Strangely, this is even true for characters included in the core rules, such as Icicle, Pulsar, and Mechanon. ===Digital Hero online magazine=== Digital Hero was the official online magazine for Hero Games, supporting its Hero System games including Champions, Fantasy Hero, Star Hero, Dark Champions, and others. It was published bimonthly in downloadable PDF format, each issue being a fixed 64 pages long not including the cover (and a blank \\"fluff\\" page serving as an inside front cover to facilitate double-sided printing). The final issue, number 47, was published in January 2008, although the company did indicate the possibility of a return in the future. ==See also== * Steve Long (Hero Games) - Line developer and co- owner ==References== == External links == * * Hero joins R.Talsorian!

It has two large plazas (Civic Center Plaza and United Nations Plaza) and a number of buildings in classical architectural style. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (formerly the Exposition Auditorium), the United Nations Charter was signed in the War Memorial Veterans Building's Herbst Theatre in 1945, leading to the creation of the United Nations. It is also where the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco (the peace treaty that officially ended the Pacific War with the Empire of Japan, which had surrendered in 1945) was signed. The San Francisco Civic Center was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1978. ==Location== The Civic Center is bounded by Market Street to the southeast, Franklin Street to the west, Turk Street to the north, and Leavenworth Street, McAllister Street, and Charles J. Brenham Place to the east. The Civic Center borders the Tenderloin neighborhood on the north and east and the Hayes Valley neighborhood on the west; Market Street separates it from the South of Market, or \\"SoMa\\", neighborhood. ==History== Proposed Civic Center from Burnham Plan of 1905. The large semi-circular plaza near the center is at the intersection of Market and Van Ness. The first permanent San Francisco City Hall was completed in 1898 on a triangular-shaped plot in what later became Civic Center, bounded by Larkin, McAllister, and Market, after a protracted construction effort that had started in 1871; although the constructors had promised to complete work within two years, \\"honest graft\\" was an accepted practice, and the cost of the structure ballooned from $1 million as budgeted to $8 million. The Civic Center was built in the early 20th century after the earlier City Hall was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. Although the architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham had provided the city with plans for a neo-classical Civic Center shortly before the 1906 earthquake, his plans were never carried out. Burnham's plan called for a large semi-circular plaza at the intersection of Market and Van Ness as a hub linking official buildings along spoked streets. Plan presented for Civic Center in April 1912 with portraits of Mayor Rolph and architectural team. Note the positions of City Hall (east of the central plaza, not west as constructed), and Art Gallery instead of State Building (north of the plaza). Following the earthquake, a temporary city hall was established on Market Street, but planning for a permanent structure and civic center did not take place for several years. The current Civic Center was planned by a group of local architects, chaired by John Galen Howard. The new Civic Center would consist of five main buildings facing a central rectangular plaza: City Hall, Auditorium, Main Library, Opera House, and State Office Building. A bond was issued on March 29, 1912 for $8.8 million to carry out the construction of the new Civic Center; at the time, the city only owned the triangular-shaped plot where the old City Hall had stood prior to the earthquake. A resolution passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors required the new City Hall to be built on the site of the old City Hall, so early plans for Civic Center showed City Hall east of the central plaza. Opinions solicited by the consulting architectural team led to the relocation of City Hall to the west side of the plaza. Ground was broken for City Hall, the first building in the new Civic Center, on April 5, 1913. Finalized plan for Civic Center, 1916. The current City Hall was completed in 1915, in time for the Panama-Pacific Exposition. The second building to be started was Exposition Auditorium; at the time, plans included a new Main Library (to be built on the site of the old City Hall) but left the former Marshall Square (bounded by Larkin, Fulton, Hyde, and Grove) undeveloped. Plans for a new opera house on Marshall Square had been dropped The Main Library (1916), the California State Building (1926), War Memorial Opera House and its neighboring twin, the War Memorial Veterans Building (which together were the nucleus of the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, completed in 1932), and the Old Federal Building (1936) were all completed after the Exposition. Civic Center Plaza was established by 1915, but not completed until 1925. Marshall Square remained undeveloped until the new Main Library was constructed there in the early 1990s. During World War II, Army barracks and Victory gardens were constructed in Civic Center Plaza, which lies directly east of City Hall and west of the Library. The 1950s through the 1970s and 1980s saw tall post-modernist Federal and State buildings constructed in the area; an underground exhibition facility, Brooks Hall, was completed beneath the plaza in 1958, followed by an adjoining garage in 1960. The Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall and Harold L. Zellerbach Rehearsal Hall were added in 1980. The 1990s saw the construction of a new Main Library on the unoccupied Marshall Square block, and the old Main Library building was converted into the Asian Art Museum, and the removal of all public benches. In 1998, the city officially renamed part of the plaza the Joseph L. Alioto Performing Arts Piazza after the former mayor. Its central location, vast open space, and the collection of government buildings have made and continue to make Civic Center the scene of massive political rallies. It has been the scene of massive anti-war protests and rallies since the Korean War. It was also the scene of major moments of the Gay Rights Movement. Activist Harvey Milk held rallies and gave speeches there. After his assassination on November 27, 1978, a massive candlelight vigil was held there. Later, it was the scene of the White Night Riots in response to the lenient sentencing of Dan White, Milk's assassin. Recently, Civic Center was the center point of same-sex marriage activism, as Mayor Gavin Newsom married couples there. ==Attractions and characteristicsGovernment center=== The centerpiece of the Civic Center is the City Hall, which heads the complex and takes up two city blocks on Polk Street. The section of the street in front of the building was renamed for Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett, a local African American activist. Across the street on McAllister Street is the headquarters of the Supreme Court of California. Across from that building is the Asian Art Museum, opened in 2004 in the former main branch building of the San Francisco Public Library, which moved to a newer building constructed just south of Fulton in 1995. North of City Hall is the Phillip Burton Federal Building and United States Courthouse for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and State of California office buildings. This includes offices of several federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation San Francisco Field Office.\\"San Francisco Division.\\" Federal Bureau of Investigation. Retrieved on June 9, 2015. \\"450 Golden Gate Avenue, 13th Floor San Francisco, CA 94102-9523\\" East of the main Civic Center complex on nearby Mission Street, is the head courthouse of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which sits across 7th from the San Francisco Federal Building complex. ===Monuments=== The Pioneer Monument, funded by the estate of James Lick and dedicated to Manifest Destiny, is located in the middle of Fulton Street between the Library and the Asian Art Museum. The section of Fulton Street between Hyde and Leavenworth streets was pedestrianized and re-developed into United Nations Plaza in 1975 as a monument for the United Nations and the signing of the UN Charter, when the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway was constructed under Market Street. The pedestrian mall was designed by Lawrence Halprin.2.6 acres, 1975, part of BART construction, Halprin as designer It was rededicated in June 1995 by visiting members of the UN General Assembly as part of its 60th anniversary, and renovated and rededicated again in 2005 during the World Environment Day event. Currently, it is the site of a small farmers' market as well as a replica of a large equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar. ===Culture=== West of City Hall on Van Ness Avenue is the War Memorial Opera House, where the U.N. Charter was signed in 1945 and the Treaty of San Francisco was signed in 1951. Davies Symphony Hall is south of the Opera House; to its north is the War Memorial Veterans Building, which contains the Herbst Theatre. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium and SHN Orpheum Theatre are also located in Civic Center. ===Parks and open spaces=== The main open space just east of City Hall is Civic Center Plaza. Despite the area's seedy reputation due to its proximity to the Tenderloin, its central location also makes it the center of many of the city's festivals and parades. Many street parades and parties are held in Civic Center Plaza, including San Francisco's Gay Pride Parade, the city's Earth Day celebration (which attracts 15,000+ people), the St. Patrick's Day parade, San Francisco's version of the Love Parade, and the San Francisco LovEvolution party. Renovated and re-opened on February 15, 2018 the Helen Diller Civic Center Playgrounds reside on the Northeast and Southeast corners of the Civic Center Plaza. The San Francisco Parks and Recreation program partnered with The Trust for Public Land to renovate the 20 year old playgrounds. The playgrounds were funded by a generous $10 million donation from the Helen Diller Family Foundation. The playgrounds serve many surrounding neighborhoods with limited open space such as the Tenderloin, Western Addition, Hayes Valley, and South of Market neighborhoods. ===Transit=== Access to Civic Center is provided by the Civic Center Station on Market, a subway stop for both BART and the Muni Metro. The F Market historic streetcar line and many Muni bus lines also run nearby. ===Education=== Civic Center is the site of four famous higher education schools: Minerva Schools at KGI, the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, the private The Art Institute of California – San Francisco and The San Francisco Conservatory of Music. UC Hastings is located on the two blocks straddling Hyde between Golden Gate and McAllister. Academy of Art University owns two buildings in the neighborhood, and the buildings are used primarily for academic and administrative purposes. ===Reputation=== Civic Center is adjacent to the skid row Tenderloin neighborhood, so it has a seedy, run-down, high-crime reputation and appearance with large numbers of homeless encampments, which have prevented it from attracting the large numbers of tourists seen in other areas of the city. Despite repeated redevelopment of Civic Center over the years aimed primarily at discouraging the homeless from camping there, large numbers of homeless people continue to camp and socialise in the area. Update: Under Mayor London Breed, increased police presence, including a mobile command center, has impacted Civic Center as a gathering place for homeless and criminals. These measures, despite clearing out the targeted populations, have not attracted new crowds of locals or tourists. The result as of December 2018 is a hub in a wealthy metro area, with the city's dense population, that appears desolate and abandoned. ===Other points of interest=== The Fox Plaza condominium complex is also located nearby. The large art installation Firefly by Ned Kahn can be seen on the side of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission building on Golden Gate Avenue. In December 2010, a set of innovative wind and solar hybrid streetlamps provided by Urban Green Energy were installedHybrid Street Lamp Hits San Francisco as part of the center's vision for sustainability. ==Selected photos== File:SFCityHall.pngSan Francisco City Hall Image:San Francisco City Hall 2.JPGCity Hall Image:Earl Warren Building (San Francisco).JPGRonald M.

They are closely related, both culturally and linguistically, to the Aghuls of southern Dagestan and, somewhat more distantly, to the Tsakhurs, Rutuls, and Tabasarans (the northern neighbors of the Lezgins). Also related, albeit more distantly, are the numerically small Jek, Kryts, Laks, Shahdagh, Budukh, and Khinalug peoples of northern Azerbaijan. These groups, together with the Lezgins, form the Samur branch of the indigenous Lezgic peoples. Lezgins are believed to descend partly from people who inhabited the region of southern Dagestan in the Bronze Age. However, there is some DNA evidence of significant admixture during the last 4,000 years with a Central Asian population, as shown by genetic links to populations throughout Europe and Asia, with notable similarities to the Burusho people of Pakistan.New York Times, 2014, \\"Genetic Mixing\\" (February 13; interactive). (Access: October 15 2014). ==History== Iranian-ruled administrative division of the Derbent khanate included many of the Lezgins until its occupation and dissolution by the Russians as a result of the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century. In the 4th century BC, the numerous tribes speaking Lezgic languages united in a union of 26 tribes, formed in the Eastern Caucasus state of Caucasian Albania, which itself was incorporated in the Persian Achaemenid Empire in 513 BC.Bruno Jacobs, \\"ACHAEMENID RULE IN Caucasus\\" in Encyclopædia Iranica. January 9, 2006. Excerpt: \\"Achaemenid rule in the Caucasus region was established, at the latest, in the course of the Scythian campaign of Darius I in 513–512 BC. The Persian domination of the cis-Caucasian area (the northern side of the range) was brief, and archeological findings indicate that the Great Caucasus formed the northern border of the empire during most, if not all, of the Achaemenid period after Darius\\" Under the influence of initially Persian but also Parthian rule Caucasian Albania was divided into several areas—Lakzi, Shirvan, etc. The Lezgic speaking tribes participated in the battle of Gaugamela under the Persian banner against the invading Alexander the Great.Chaumont, M. L. Albania .Encyclopaedia Iranica. Under Parthian rule, Iranian political and cultural influence increased in the whole region of their Caucasian Albanian province, therefore including where the Lezgic speaking tribes lived.Toumanoff, Cyril. The Arsacids. Encyclopædia Iranica. excerpt:\\"Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branched reigned—of a pan-Arsacid family federation. Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by a predominance of \\"Iranianism,\\" and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated\\" Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome of the region due to their wars with the Parthians, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branches reigned—of a pan-Arsacid family federation. Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by again a predominance of \\"Iranianism\\", and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated of the region. An incursion in this era was made by the Alans who between 134 and 136 attacked regions including where Lezgic tribes lived, but Vologases persuaded them to withdraw, probably by paying them. In 252–253, rule over the Lezgic tribes changed from Parthian to Sassanid Persian. Caucasian Albania became a vassal state,Yarshater, p. 141. now of the Sassanids, but retained its monarchy; the Albanian king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sassanid marzban (military governor) of the territory.Nevertheless, \\"despite being one of the chief vassals of Sasanian Shahanshah, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sassanid marzban (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority. The Roman Empire obtained control over some of the southernmost Lezgin regions for a few years around 300 AD, but then the Sassanid Persians regained control and subsequently dominated the area for centuries until the Arab invasions. Although Lezgins were first introduced to Islam perhaps as early as the 8th century, the Lezgins remained primarily animist until the 15th century, when Muslim influence became stronger, with Persian traders coming in from the south, and the Golden Horde increasingly pressing from the north. In the early 16th century, the Persian Safavids consolidated their control over large parts of Dagestan for centuries onwards. As a result of the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1578–1590, the Ottomans managed to wrest control of the region for a short period of time, until it was regained by the Safavids under king Abbas I (r. 1588–1629). A notable Lezgin from the Safavid Iranian era was Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, who served as Safavid grand vizier from 1716 to 1720, during the reign of king (shah) Sultan Husayn (1694–1722). By the early course of the 18th century, the Safavid Empire was in a state of heavy decline. In 1721, the Lezgins sacked and looted the city of Shamakhi, the provincial capital of Shirvan. The Lak Kazi Kumukh Khanate controlled a part of the Lezgins for a time in the 18th century after the disintegration of the Safavid Empire In the first half of the 18th century, Persia was able to restore its full authority throughout the entire Caucasus under Nader Shah. After the death of Nader, he created the state into divided several smaller khanates. Some Lezgins were part of the Kuba Khanate in what is now Azerbaijan, while others fell under the jurisdiction of the Derbent Khanate. The main part of Lezgins united in \\"free society\\" (Magalim) (Akhty para (now Akhtynsky District), Kure (now Kurakhsky District), Alty-para and Dokuz-para (now Dokuzparinsky District)). Some lezgin clans were in Rutul Federation. Lezgins in the 1860s In 1813, as a result of the Treaty of Gulistan, the Russians gained control over southern Dagestan and most of what is the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other area's where the Lezgins lived and removed Iran from the military equation.Aksan, Virginia. (2014). Ottoman Wars, 1700–1870: An Empire Besieged page 463. Routledge. The Russian administration subsequently created the Kiurin Khanate, later to become the Kiurin district. Many Lezgins in Dagestan, however, participated in the Great Caucasian War that started roughly during the same time the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century were happening, and fought against the Russians alongside the Avar Imam Shamil, who for 25 years (1834–1859) defied Russian rule. It was not until after his defeat in 1859 that the Russians consolidated their rule over Dagestan and the Lezgins. In 1930, Sheikh Mohammed Effendi Shtulskim organized an uprising against Soviet rule, which was suppressed after several months. In the 20th century, attempts were made to create a republic of Lezgistan (independent or as an autonomous region). Some Lezgins were deported to Central Asia in the 1940s by Stalin's regime. ==Ethnonym== The origin of the ethnonym Lezgin requires further research. Nevertheless, most researchers attribute the derivation of Lezgi to be from the ancient Legi and early medieval Lakzi. Ancient Greek historians, including Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder, referred to Legoi people who inhabited Caucasian Albania. Arab historians of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned a kingdom called Lakz, in present-day southern Dagestan. Al Masoudi referred to inhabitants of this area as Lakzams (Lezgins),Yakut, IV, 364. According to al-Masoudi (Murudzh, II, 5) who defended Shirvan against invaders from the north.VFMinorsky. History of Shirvan. M. 1963 The Lezgin ethnic group probably resulted from a merger of the Akhty, the Alty and Dokus Para federations, and some clans from among the Rutuls. Prior to the Russian Revolution, \\"Lezgin\\" was a term applied to all ethnic groups inhabiting the present-day Russian Republic of Dagestan. In the 19th century, the term was used more broadly for all ethnic groups speaking non-Nakh Northeast Caucasian languages, including Caucasian Avars, Laks, and many others (although the Vainakh peoples, who were Northeast Caucasian language speakers were referred to as \\"Circassians\\"). == Geography == Lezgistan from map of the Caucasus by Johann Gustav Gaerber (1728) The Lezgins inhabit a compact territory that straddles the border area of southern Daghestan and northern Azerbaijan. It lies, for the most part, in the southeastern portion of Daghestan in (Akhtynsky District, Dokuzparinsky District, Suleyman-Stalsky District, Kurakhsky District, Magaramkentsky District, Khivsky District, Derbentsky District and Rutulsky District) and contiguous northeastern Azerbaijan (in Kuba, Qusar, Qakh, Khachmaz, Oguz, Qabala, Nukha, and Ismailli districts). The Lezgin territories are divided into two physiographic zones: a region of high, rugged mountains and the piedmont (foothills). Most of the Lezgin territory is in the mountainous zone, where a number of peaks (like Baba Dagh) reach over 3,500 meters in elevation. There are deep and isolated canyons and gorges formed by the tributaries of the Samur and Gulgeri Chai rivers. In the mountainous zones the summers are very hot and dry, with drought conditions a constant threat. There are few trees in this region aside from those in the deep canyons and along the streams themselves. Drought-resistant shrubs and weeds dominate the natural flora. The winters here are frequently windy and brutally cold. In this zone the Lezgins engaged primarily in animal husbandry (mostly sheep and goats) and in craft industries. In the extreme east of the Lezgin territory, where the mountains give way to the narrow coastal plain of the Caspian Sea, and to the far south, in Azerbaijan, are the foothills. This region has relatively mild, very dry winters and hot, dry summers. Trees are few here also. In this region animal husbandry and artisanry were supplemented by some agriculture (along the alluvial deposits near the rivers). ==Culture== An antique Lesghi rug, east Caucasus, c. 1880 The material culture significantly influence Azerbaijan, especially Lezgins living in Azerbaijan. The folk songs a central place belongs to the lyrical songs of the dance character with vivid instrumental sections; instrumental music itself is full melizmatika. Folk art is also presented dances, among which, in particular, the famous \\"Lezginka\\", common among the peoples of the Caucasus. There are more calm male dance Zarb makam as well as slow-flowing dances Akhty tea Perizat Khanum Useynel, Bahtavar. First Lezgin theater originated in 1906 in the village of Akhty. In 1935, based on the semi-professional team was created Lezgin State Music and Drama Theatre named after S. Stalsky. In 1998, the State Lezgin theater was opened in Azerbaijan, located in Qusar. ===Languages=== The Lezgian language belongs to the Lezgic branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family (with Aghul, Rutul, Tsakhur, Tabasaran, Budukh, Khinalug, Jek, Khaput, Kryts, and Udi). The Lezgian language has three closely related (mutually intelligible) dialects: Kurin (also referred to as Gunei or Kurakh), Akhti, and Kuba. The Kurin dialect is the most widespread of the three and is spoken throughout most of the Lezgin territories in Daghestan, including the town of Kurakh, which, historically, was the most important cultural, political, and economic center in the Lezgin territory in Daghestan and is the former seat of the khanate of Kurin. The Akhti dialect is spoken in southeastern Daghestan. The Kuba dialect, the most Turkicized of the three, is widespread among the Lezgins of northern Azerbaijan (named for the town of Kuba, the cultural and economical focus of the region). ===Religions=== Today, the Lezgins are predominantly Sunni Muslims, with a Shia minority living in Miskindja village in Dagestan. The main type of settlement in Lezghins - the village (\\"hur\\"). With regard to social groups Lezgin village, it is divided into quarters. Distributed large geographically-related settlement (one quarter - one tukhum). Each village had a mosque, rural area - Kim, a gathering of residents (male part) at the village assembly to address the most important issues of public life of the village. ===Dance=== Lezgian people, dancing lezginka in Akhti village, 1900 Lezgian dance, including the Lezgin solo male and pair dance, are common among many peoples of the Caucasus. The dance uses a 2 image. The man moves in the way \\"eagle\\", alternates between a slow and rapid pace. The most spectacular movements are dance movements of men, when he is on his toes, throwing his hands in different directions. The woman moves in the form of \\"Swan\\", bewitching graceful posture and smooth hand movements. The woman increases the tempo of her dance after the man. Not surprisingly, the dance, common among all the Caucasian peoples, was named in accordance with the ancient totem of the Lezgins: the word \\"Lek\\" () means eagle. ==Population== Lezgins live mainly in Azerbaijan and Russia (Dagestan). The total population is believed to be around 700,000, with 474,000 living in Russia. In Azerbaijan, the government census counts 180,300.The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Population by ethnic groups However, Lezgin national organizations mention 600,000 to 900,000, the disparity being that many Lezgins claim Azeri nationality to escape job and education discrimination in Azerbaijan.Minahan, p. 1084. \\"Lezgin national organizations estimate the actual Lezgin population in Azerbaijan at between 600,000 and 900,000, much higher than the official estimates. The disparity arises from the number of ethnic Lezgins registered as ethnic Azeris during the soviet period and continue to claim Azeri nationality to escape job and education discrimination in Azerbaijan.\\" Despite the assimilationist policy of the Azeri government, the Lezgin population is undoubtedly greater than it appears.Robert Bruce Ware, Enver Kisriew, E.F. Kisriew, \\"Dagestan: Russian hegemony and Islamic resistance in the North Caucasus\\" ,M.E. Sharpe, 2009 As Svante Cornell adds; Lezgins also live in Central Asia,Yo'av Karny,\\"Highlanders: A Journey to the Caucasus in Quest of Memory\\",Macmillan, 2001. pp 112:\\"The last 1989 all Soviet census recorded 204,400 Lezgins in Daghestan and 171,395 Lezgins in Azerbaijan. Both figures reflected a relative, almost identical decline (5 percent) in Lezgin numbers in both \\"homelands\\". Roughly 65,000 Lezgins were counted in other parts of the Soviet Union, mostly Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan\\" mainly due to Stalin's deportation policies. ===Situation in Azerbaijan=== Lezgins are, \\"generally speaking\\", well integrated into the society of Azerbaijan. Mixed marriages are furthermore common. Lastly, Lezgins in Azerbaijan have a better level of education compared to their kin in Dagestan. In 1992 a Lezgin organization named Sadval was established to promote Lezgin rights. Sadval campaigned for the redrawing of the Russian–Azerbaijani border to allow for the creation of a single Lezgin state encompassing areas in Russia and Azerbaijan where Lezgins were compactly settled. In Azerbaijan a more moderate organization called Samur was formed, advocating more cultural autonomy for Lezgins in Azerbaijan. Lezgins traditionally suffered from unemployment and a shortage of land. A major consequence of the outbreak of the war in Chechnya in 1994 was the closure of the border between Russia and Azerbaijan: as a result the Lezgins were for the first time in their history separated by an international border restricting their movement. The high tide of Lezgin mobilization in Azerbaijan appeared to have passed towards the end of the 1990s. Sadval was banned by the Azerbaijani authorities after official allegations that it was involved in a bombing of the Baku underground. The end of the Karabakh war, and Lezgin resistance to forced conscription, deprived the movement of a key issue on which to mobilize. In 1998 Sadval split into ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ wings, following which it appeared to lose much of its popularity on both sides of the Russian–Azerbaijani border. However, Azerbaijani–Lezgin relations continued to be complicated by claims that Islamic fundamentalism enjoyed disproportionate popularity among Lezgins. In July 2000 Azerbaijani security forces arrested members of Lezgin and Avar ethnicity of a group named the Warriors of Islam, which allegedly was planning an insurgency against the Azerbaijani state. Lezgins expressed concern over underrepresentation in the Azerbaijani Parliament (Milli Meclis) after a shift away from proportional representation in the parliamentary elections of November 2005. Lezgins had been represented by two members of parliament in the previous parliament, but are now represented by only one. Lezgins state that they face discrimination and that they feel forced to assimilate into Azeri identity to avoid economic and education discrimination. Therefore, the real number of Lezgins may be significantly higher than presented in censuses. Lezgin is taught as a foreign language in areas where many Lezgins are settled, but teaching resources are scarce. Lezgin textbooks come from Russia and are not adapted to local conditions. Although Lezgin newspapers are available, Lezgins have also expressed concern over the disappearance of their rich oral tradition. The only Lezgin television broadcasting available in Azerbaijan is that received over the border from Russia. In March 2006 Azerbaijani media reported that Sadval had formed an 'underground' terrorist unit carrying out operations in Dagestan. Security forces across the border in Dagestan in Russia, responded sceptically to these reports. === Situation in Dagestan === According to reports Lezgins in Dagestan suffer disproportionately from unemployment, with unemployment rates in Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan twice the republican average of 32 per cent. This may be one contributory factor to renewed calls from within the Sadval movement in January 2006 for a redrawing of the Russian-Azerbaijani border to incorporate Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan within Azerbaijan. In March 1999 another organization, the Federal Lezgin National Cultural Autonomy, was established as an extraterritorial movement advocating cultural autonomy for Lezgins. ==See also== * Gotfrid Hasanov * Nazim Huseynov * Nader's Dagestan campaign * Suleyman Kerimov * Suleyman Stalsky * Lezginka * Lezgian language * Lezgistan * North Caucasian people * Northeast Caucasian people == References == ==Bibliography== * Minahan, J.

The dialect of Basel forms a Low Alemannic linguistic exclave in the High Alemannic region. == Phonetics and phonology  Consonants ===  Aspirated plosives  Basel German is characterised by aspirates which are absent or at least less common in other dialects. Compare Basel German Khind (usually spelled Kind), pronounced more or less as Standard German Kind, with Chind with initial , used in all other Swiss German dialects, with the exception of the dialect of Chur. Thus, Basel German did not complete the second Germanic sound shift (High German consonant shift). Nowadays, many speakers pronounce the (or [χ], to be more exact), however. There are nevertheless still words that are never pronounced with , for example kenne (Standard German kennen, to know) or Keenig/König (Standard German König). Typically, words from Standard German or Latin are pronounced with aspirated , too, which is not or only to a lesser extent done in other dialects. Examples: phee or pee (name of letter), or (to keep), Phaargg or Pargg (park); Thee or Tee (tea and name of letter), tholl or toll (great, swell); kha(a)/kaa, ghaa' (name of letter; had), Khaschte'/ Kaschte (cupboard), kheje or gheie (to fall, throw).  Affricates  Like other dialects and forms of the standard, Basel German has /pf, ts/ as well as /tʃ/. Examples: Pfanne (pan), Zaan (tooth), dütsch (German), Tschooli (stupid person, traditional word), Tschooppe (jacket, traditional word), tschegge (to understand, from English ‘to check’).  Pronunciation of phoneme  A French-style pronunciation of as is also used in Basel German, although many younger speakers—especially those with foreign parents—also use a tapped which is more common in other Swiss German dialects. Traditionally, is voiceless , and it may sometimes be described as a lenis . The pronunciation per se seems to derive from French (originally Parisian), and was probably re-interpreted as a lenis according to Basel German phonology. Not surprisingly, French influence was for a long time dominant in Basel, with well-to-do families speaking French even at home. At least in clusters, the distinction between /x/ and /r/ is neutralised, as is the distinction between lenis and fortis consonants in clusters.  Lenition of consonants  Basel German also has more lenis sounds in word-initial position—for example, Dag (day). This lenition is now often absent due to influence from other dialects, for example, the name of Santa Claus, Santiglaus, is now often pronounced with or , as is the word Graft (Standard German Kraft), which traditionally has a lenis sound, now also and .  Lenis plosives  Lenis plosives are however all voiceless; whereas fortis plosives are long or geminated. They are (like other lenis or short consonants) always preceded by long vowels, with the possible exception of unstressed vowels. According to Pilch, vowel length is not distinctive, however, vowel length is not always predictable: 'to guess' has both a long vowel and a long/geminated consonant. Examples: Dag (day), umme (around), ane (there), loose or lohse (listen), Gaas gas. Phonemically speaking, may also be (more traditionally) transcribed , or as unvoiced .  Fortis consonants  Fortis or long consonants in general are more stable than in other dialects—‘to swim’ is always schwimme, whereas it’s pronounced with only a short in other dialects. This is probably because in stressed words, short vowels only appear before double or geminated/long consonants. Hence, a word like is not possible in Basel German. As in other dialects, the difference between fortis and lenis is in length. Pilch (180) however interprets as alveolar, not long. Fortis consonants may also be transcribed , since lenis are often transcribed as . However, voicing is always absent. Examples: (to swim), (to pack), (to squeeze), (to guess — note the long followed by fortis ) === Vowels ===  Unrounding of vowels  Unrounding was also typical, but now it has been abandoned by many speakers. Lengthening of vowels is also found, linking it more closely to Standard German than all other Swiss German dialects. Examples: (\\"good day\\"; grüezi in other dialects, still more common), Hell (\\"hell\\", now rounded form more common), (\\"biggest, greatest\\"; now grööscht more common).  Lengthening and shortening of vowels  Lengthening always occurs before lenis (short) consonants, for example in words like Daag (day), loose (listen), miir (we). Shortening, on the other hand, always occurs before long or fortis consonants, for example in Baseldytsch, the name of the dialect: whereas other dialects have long in Baseldütsch or any other word with -dütsch (German) in it, Basel German always has short or . /a:/ and /o:/ (as well as /ø:/), however, are usually not shortened, probably because of the shift from earlier /a:/ to /o:/. Another reason may be the fact that those are the only vowels that exist as such only as long vowels, i.e. whereas you can shorten [i:] to [i], it is never possible to shorten [e:] to [e] because *[e] as such does not exist in Basel German. Some speakers, however, use short open vowels in a number of words, e.g. /hɔkkə/ instead of /ho:kkə/ ('hook'). Those speakers who use this pronunciation lack one minimal pair, since /hɔkkə/ also translates as 'crouch'. However, this shortening of /o:/ /ø:/ /a:/ /æ:/ is not general. Note however that /a:/ exists mainly in words of foreign origin such as /sa'la:tt/.  Velarisation of MHG /a:/  Middle High German was velarised and appears as . For example, Strooss ‘street’.  Vowels before /r/  Typically (but not exclusively) open vowels occur before , for example, Oor (‘ear’) has the allophone , not . Both and only occur before in native words. Additionally, vowels before /r/ are always long, with the exception of loan words such as ‘sorry’, ‘curry’ as well as unstressed vowels. Examples: Oor ‘ear’, Eer 'honour'.  Pronunciation of /a/ /a:/  The vowels and traditionally are front, yet distinct from and . Nowadays, a back pronunciation and is more common. Examples: Sagg (bag), Baasel (Basel).  Diphthongs  Modern pronunciation has , , [ɛj], , , , and ; traditional pronunciation lacks which is partly , partly . In modern pronunciation , , , are , , , whereas traditional pronunciation has , etc. Suter (1992: 11) posits only one diphthong , pronounced . In exclamations and few other words, also exist. Examples: eläi (alone), draaie (to turn), drei (three), baue (to build), blaau (blue), vier (four), zue (shut), nöi (new); nei (traditional). ==Sociolinguistics== Unlike other dialects, Basel German features a rather strong dichotomy between the traditional form—Baseldytsch, used especially for the Carnival of Basel (Basler Fasnacht)—and normal spoken language. Some speakers prefer to use the more traditional variety in written form. The traditional variety is normally associated with the upper classes and with Fasnacht. Like other Swiss German dialects, Basel German has (at least in Basel) more prestige than Standard German, and it is now even used in churches. ==Spelling== There is a lot of confusion especially when it comes to the use of the grapheme ‘y’, which is often used for rounded sounds, i.e. or , whereas it is exclusively used for traditionally. Typically, lenis stops are spelled ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘g’, fortis stops are spelled ‘p’, ‘pp’, sometimes ‘bb’ (öpper, öbber, ebber ‘someone’); ‘t’, ‘tt’, sometimes ‘dd’ (Middi ‘middle’); ‘gg’, rarely and mainly in loan-words ‘k’, ‘ck’, etc. This use of ‘gg’ for the fortis, unaspirated consonant is used also in other varieties of Swiss German, but sometimes abandoned in favour of spellings more closely resembling Standard German spellings. Examples: drugge (to push), Läggerli (typical sweet cookie; but also Läckerli), Sagg (bag; but sometimes also Sack), Gugge (bag, traditional word). The fortis /xx/ is always spelled like lenis /x/, namely . The same is true for /ʃʃ/. Obviously, especially the typical use of ‘y’ and ‘gg’ leads to confusion, even among native speakers, since the dialect is not taught in schools. Aspirates are normally spelled as in Standard German, namely with ‘p’, ‘t’, ‘k’. However, words where the aspirates derive from a lenis consonant plus /h/ are usually written as lenis plus , e.g., 'to keep', 'to fall'. ==Terminology== Baseldytsch reflects traditional pronunciation with , Baseldütsch reflects modern pronunciation with , whereas Baseldeutsch is the Standard German form. Baslerdüütsch is used in other dialects. == Bibliography == * Muster, Hans Peter and Beatrice Bürkli Flaig. 2001. Baselbieter Wörterbuch.

A naturally aspirated engine, also known as a normally aspirated engine, is an internal combustion engine in which air intake depends solely on atmospheric pressure and does not have forced induction through a turbocharger or a supercharger. Many sports cars specifically use naturally aspirated engines to avoid turbo lag. == Description == In a naturally aspirated engine, air for combustion (Diesel cycle in a Diesel engine or specific types of Otto cycle in petrol engines, namely petrol direct injection) or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines), is drawn into the engine's cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward bottom dead centre during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine's inlet tract, which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percent—and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder. The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine's maximum theoretical power output, in addition to being influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter of which decreases as the operating altitude increases. This is in contrast to a forced-induction engine, in which a mechanically driven supercharger or an exhaust-driven turbocharger is employed to facilitate increasing the mass of intake air beyond what could be produced by atmospheric pressure alone. Nitrous oxide can also be used to artificially increase the mass of oxygen present in the intake air. This is accomplished by injecting liquid nitrous oxide into the intake, which supplies significantly more oxygen in a given volume than is possible with atmospheric air. Nitrous oxide is 36.3% available oxygen by mass after it decomposes as compared with atmospheric air at 20.95%. Nitrous oxide also boils at at atmospheric pressures and offers significant cooling from the latent heat of vaporization, which also aids in increasing the overall air charge density significantly compared to natural aspiration. As a two-stroke Diesel engine is incapable of this natural aspiration, some method of charging the cylinders with scavenging air must be integrated into the engine design. This is usually achieved with a positive displacement blower driven by the crankshaft. The blower does not act as a supercharger in this application, as it is sized to produce a volume of air flow that is in direct proportion to engine's requirement for combustion, at a given power and speed. By the Society of Automotive Engineer's definition, a mechanically scavenged two-stroke diesel engine is considered to be naturally aspirated. == Applications == Most automobile petrol engines, as well as many small engines used for non-automotive purposes, are naturally aspirated. Most modern diesel engines powering highway vehicles are turbocharged to produce a more favourable power-to-weight ratio, a higher torque curve, as well as better fuel efficiency and lower exhaust emissions. Turbocharging is nearly universal on diesel engines that are used in railroad, marine engines, and commercial stationary applications (electrical power generation, for example). Forced induction is also used with reciprocating aircraft engines to negate some of the power loss that occurs as the aircraft climbs to higher altitudes. == Advantages and disadvantages == The advantages and disadvantages of a naturally aspirated engine in relation to a same-sized engine relying on forced induction include: ===Advantages=== * Easier to maintain and repair * Lower development and production costs * Increased reliability, partly due to fewer separate parts * More direct throttle response (due to the lack of turbo lag) * Less potential for overheating * Tend to sound better ===Disadvantages=== * Decreased efficiency * Decreased power-to-weight ratio * Decreased potential for tuning * Increased power loss at higher elevation (due to lower air pressure) compared to forced induction engines == See also == *Carburetor *Fuel injection *Manifold vacuum == References == Category:Engine technology Category:Internal combustion engine ","title":"Naturally aspirated engine"},{"id":"515983","text":"The Theory of Moral Sentiments is a 1759 book by Adam Smith.Letter from David Hume to Adam Smith, 12 April 1759, in Hume, D. (2011) New Letters of David Hume, ed. Raymond Klibansky and Ernest C. Mossner, Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 49. via Google Books; via Google Books It provided the ethical, philosophical, psychological, and methodological underpinnings to Smith's later works, including The Wealth of Nations (1776), Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795), and Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763) (first published in 1896). ==Overview== Broadly speaking, Smith followed the views of his mentor, Francis Hutcheson of the University of Glasgow, who divided moral philosophy into four parts: Ethics and Virtue; Private rights and Natural liberty; Familial rights (called Economics); and State and Individual rights (called Politics). ===Sixth sense=== Hutcheson had abandoned the psychological view of moral philosophy, claiming that motives were too fickle to be used as a basis for a philosophical system. Instead, he hypothesised a dedicated \\"sixth sense\\" to explain morality. This idea, to be taken up by David Hume (see Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature), claimed that man is pleased by utility. ===Experimental method=== Smith rejected his teacher's reliance on this special sense. Starting in about 1741, Smith set on the task of using Hume's experimental method (appealing to human experience) to replace the specific moral sense with a pluralistic approach to morality based on a multitude of psychological motives. The Theory of Moral Sentiments begins with the following assertion: > How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles > in his nature, which interest him in the fortunes of others, and render > their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except > the pleasure of seeing it. Of this kind is pity or compassion, the emotion > we feel for the misery of others, when we either see it, or are made to > conceive it in a very lively manner. That we often derive sorrow from the > sorrows of others, is a matter of fact too obvious to require any instances > to prove it; for this sentiment, like all the other original passions of > human nature, is by no means confined to the virtuous or the humane, though > they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite sensibility. The greatest > ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of society, is not > altogether without it. ===Sympathy=== Smith departed from the \\"moral sense\\" tradition of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume, as the principle of sympathy takes the place of that organ. \\"Sympathy\\" was the term Smith used for the feeling of these moral sentiments. It was the feeling with the passions of others. It operated through a logic of mirroring, in which a spectator imaginatively reconstructed the experience of the person he watches: > As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form no > idea of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what we > ourselves should feel in the like situation. Though our brother is on the > rack, as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will never inform > us of what he suffers. They never did, and never can, carry us beyond our > own person, and it is by the imagination only that we can form any > conception of what are his sensations. Neither can that faculty help us to > this any other way, than by representing to us what would be our own, if we > were in his case. It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of > his, which our imaginations copy. By the imagination, we place ourselves in > his situation. However, Smith rejected the idea that Man was capable of forming moral judgements beyond a limited sphere of activity, again centered on his own self-interest: > The administration of the great system of the universe ... the care of the > universal happiness of all rational and sensible beings, is the business of > God and not of man. To man is allotted a much humbler department, but one > much more suitable to the weakness of his powers, and to the narrowness of > his comprehension: the care of his own happiness, of that of his family, his > friends, his country.... But though we are ... endowed with a very strong > desire of those ends, it has been entrusted to the slow and uncertain > determinations of our reason to find out the proper means of bringing them > about. Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and > immediate instincts. Hunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, > and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes, > and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends > which the great Director of nature intended to produce by them. > The rich only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable. They > consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness > and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole > end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they > employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they > divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They are led by > an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of > life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal > portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without > knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the > multiplication of the species. In a published lecture, Vernon L. Smith further argued that Theory of Moral Sentiments and Wealth of Nations together encompassed: > \\"one behavioral axiom, 'the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one > thing for another,' where the objects of trade I will interpret to include > not only goods, but also gifts, assistance, and favors out of sympathy ... > whether it is goods or favors that are exchanged, they bestow gains from > trade that humans seek relentlessly in all social transactions.

He calls this sympathy, defining it \\"our fellow-feeling with any passion whatsoever\\" (p. 5). He argues that this occurs under either of two conditions: * We see firsthand the fortune or misfortune of another person * The fortune or misfortune is vividly depicted to us Although this is apparently true, he follows to argue that this tendency lies even in \\"the greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of society\\" (p. 2). Smith also proposes several variables that can moderate the extent of sympathy, noting that the situation that is the cause of the passion is a large determinant of our response: * The vividness of the account of the condition of another person An important point put forth by Smith is that the degree to which we sympathize, or \\"tremble and shudder at the thought of what he feels\\", is proportional to the degree of vividness in our observation or the description of the event. * Knowledge of the causes of the emotions When observing the anger of another person, for example, we are unlikely to sympathize with this person because we \\"are unacquainted with his provocation\\" and as a result cannot imagine what it is like to feel what he feels. Further, since we can see the \\"fear and resentment\\" of those who are the targets of the person's anger we are likely to sympathize and take side with them. Thus, sympathetic responses are often conditional on—or their magnitude is determined by—the causes of the emotion in the person being sympathized with. * Whether other people are involved in the emotion Specifically, emotions such as joy and grief tell us about the \\"good or bad fortune\\" of the person we are observing them in, whereas anger tells us about the bad fortune with respect to another person. It is the difference between intrapersonal emotions, such as joy and grief, and interpersonal emotions, such as anger, that causes the difference in sympathy, according to Smith. That is, intrapersonal emotions trigger at least some sympathy without the need for context whereas interpersonal emotions are dependent on context. He also proposes a natural 'motor' response to seeing the actions of others: If we see a knife hacking off a person's leg we wince away, if we see someone dance we move in the same ways, we feel the injuries of others as if we had them ourselves. Smith makes clear that we sympathize not only with the misery of others but also the joy; he states that observing an emotional state through the \\"looks and gestures\\" in another person is enough to initiate that emotional state in ourselves. Furthermore, we are generally insensitive to the real situation of the other person; we are instead sensitive to how we would feel ourselves if we were in the situation of the other person. For example, a mother with a suffering baby feels \\"the most complete image of misery and distress\\" while the child merely feels \\"the uneasiness of the present instant\\" (p. 8). Part I, Section I, Chapter II: Of Pleasure and mutual sympathy Smith continues by arguing that people feel pleasure from the presence of others with the same emotions as one's self, and displeasure in the presence of those with \\"contrary\\" emotions. Smith argues that this pleasure is not the result of self-interest: that others are more likely to assist oneself if they are in a similar emotional state. Smith also makes the case that pleasure from mutual sympathy is not derived merely from a heightening of the original felt emotion amplified by the other person. Smith further notes that people get more pleasure from the mutual sympathy of negative emotions than positive emotions; we feel \\"more anxious to communicate to our friends\\" (p. 13) our negative emotions. Smith proposes that mutual sympathy heightens the original emotion and \\"disburdens\\" the person of sorrow. This is a 'relief' model of mutual sympathy, where mutual sympathy heightens the sorrow but also produces pleasure from relief \\"because the sweetness of his sympathy more than compensates the bitterness of that sorrow\\" (p. 14). In contrast, mocking or joking about their sorrow is the \\"cruelest insult\\" one can inflict on another person: > To seem to not be affected by the joy of our companions is but want of > politeness; but to not wear a serious countentance when they tell us their > afflictions, is real and gross inhumanity (p. 14). He makes clear that mutual sympathy of negative emotions is a necessary condition for friendship, whereas mutual sympathy of positive emotions is desirable but not required. This is due to the \\"healing consolation of mutual sympathy\\" that a friend is 'required' to provide in response to \\"grief and resentment\\", as if not doing so would be akin to a failure to help the physically wounded. Not only do we get pleasure from the sympathy of others, but we also obtain pleasure from being able to successfully sympathize with others, and discomfort from failing to do so. Sympathizing is pleasurable, failing to sympathize is aversive. Smith also makes the case that failing to sympathize with another person may not be aversive to ourselves but we may find the emotion of the other person unfounded and blame them, as when another person experiences great happiness or sadness in response to an event that we think should not warrant such a response. Part I, Section I, Chapter III: Of the manner in which we judge of the propriety or impropriety of the affections of other men by their concord or dissonance with our own Smith presents the argument that approval or disapproval of the feelings of others is completely determined by whether we sympathize or fail to sympathize with their emotions. Specifically, if we sympathize with the feelings of another we judge that their feelings are just, and if we do not sympathize we judge that their feelings are unjust. This holds in matters of opinion also, as Smith flatly states that we judge the opinions of others as correct or incorrect merely by determining whether they agree with our own opinions. Smith also cites a few examples where our judgment is not in line with our emotions and sympathy, as when we judge the sorrow of a stranger who has lost her mother as being justified even though we know nothing about the stranger and do not sympathize ourselves. However, according to Smith these non-emotional judgments are not independent from sympathy in that although we do not feel sympathy we do recognize that sympathy would be appropriate and lead us to this judgment and thus deem the judgment as correct. \\"Utopian\\" or Ideal Political Systems: ”The man of system . . . is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same direction, the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder.” — Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759 Next, Smith puts forth that not only are the consequences of one's actions judged and used to determine whether one is just or unjust in committing them, but also whether one's sentiments justified the action that brought about the consequences. Thus, sympathy plays a role in determining judgments of the actions of others in that if we sympathize with the affections that brought about the action we are more likely to judge the action as just, and vice versa: > If upon bringing the case home to our own breast we find that the sentiments > which it gives occasion to, coincide and tally with our own, we necessarily > approve of them as proportioned and suitable to their objects; if otherwise, > we necessarily disapprove of them, as extravagant and out of proportion (p. > 20). Part I, Section I, Chapter IV: The same subject continued Smith delineates two conditions under which we judge the \\"propriety or impropriety of the sentiments of another person\\": * 1 When the objects of the sentiments are considered alone * 2 When the objects of the sentiments are considered in relation to the person or other persons When one's sentiments coincide with another person's when the object is considered alone, then we judge that their sentiment is justified. Smith lists objects that are in one of two domains: science and taste. Smith argues that sympathy does not play a role in judgments of these objects; differences in judgment arise only due to difference in attention or mental acuity between people. When the judgment of another person agrees with us on these types of objects it is not notable; however, when another person's judgment differs from us, we assume that they have some special ability to discern characteristics of the object we have not already noticed, and thus view their judgment with special approbation called admiration. Smith continues by noting that we assign value to judgments not based on usefulness (utility) but on similarity to our own judgment, and we attribute to those judgments which are in line with our own the qualities of correctness or truth in science, and justness or delicateness in taste. Thus, the utility of a judgment is \\"plainly an afterthought\\" and \\"not what first recommends them to our approbation\\" (p. 24). Of objects that fall into the second category, such as the misfortune of oneself or another person, Smith argues that there is no common starting point for judgment but are vastly more important in maintaining social relations. Judgments of the first kind are irrelevant as long as one is able to share a sympathetic sentiment with another person; people may converse in total disagreement about objects of the first kind as long as each person appreciates the sentiments of the other to a reasonable degree. However, people become intolerable to each other when they have no feeling or sympathy for the misfortunes or resentment of the other: \\"You are confounded at my violence and passion, and I am enraged at your cold insensibility and want of feelings\\" (p. 26). Another important point Smith makes is that our sympathy will never reach the degree or \\"violence\\" of the person who experiences it, as our own \\"safety\\" and comfort as well as separation from the offending object constantly \\"intrude\\" on our efforts to induce a sympathetic state in ourselves. Thus, sympathy is never enough, as the \\"sole consolation\\" for the sufferer is \\"to see the emotions of their hearts, in every respect, beat time to his own, in the violent and disagreeable passions\\" (p. 28). Therefore, the original sufferer is likely to dampen her feelings to be in \\"concord\\" with the degree of sentiment expressible by the other person, who feels only due to the ability of one's imagination. It is this which is \\"sufficient for the harmony of society\\" (p. 28). Not only does the person dampen her expression of suffering for the purpose of sympathizing, but she also takes the perspective of the other person who is not suffering, thus slowly changing her perspective and allowing the calmness of the other person and reduction of violence of the sentiment to improve her spirits. As a friend is likely to engage in more sympathy than a stranger, a friend actually slows the reduction in our sorrows because we do not temper our feelings out of sympathizing with the perspective of the friend to the degree that we reduce our sentiments in the presence of acquaintances, or a group of acquaintances. This gradual tempering of our sorrows from the repeated perspective-taking of someone in a more calm state make \\"society and conversation...the most powerful remedies for restoring the mind to its tranquility\\" (p. 29). Part I, Section I, Chapter V: Of the amiable and respectable virtues Smith starts to use an important new distinction in this section and late in the previous section: * The \\"person principally concerned\\": The person who has had emotions aroused by an object * The spectator: The person observing and sympathizing with the emotionally aroused \\"person principally concerned\\" These two people have two different sets of virtues. The person principally concerned, in \\"bring[ing] down emotions to what the spectator can go along with\\" (p. 30), demonstrates \\"self-denial\\" and \\"self-government\\" whereas the spectator displays \\"the candid condescension and indulgent humanity\\" of \\"enter[ing]into the sentiments of the person principally concerned.\\" Smith returns to anger and how we find \\"detestable...the insolence and brutality\\" of the person principally concerned but \\"admire...the indignation which they naturally call forth in that of the impartial spectator\\" (p. 32). Smith concludes that the \\"perfection\\" of human nature is this mutual sympathy, or \\"love our neighbor as we love ourself\\" by \\"feeling much for others and little for ourself\\" and to indulge in \\"benevolent affections\\" (p. 32). Smith makes clear that it is this ability to \\"self- command\\" our \\"ungovernable passions\\" through sympathizing with others that is virtuous. Smith further distinguishes between virtue and propriety: Part I, Section II: Of the degrees of which different passions are consistent with propriety * Chapter 1: Of the passions which take their origins from the body * Chapter 2: Of the passions which take their origins from a particular turn or habit of the imagination * Chapter 3: Of the unsocial passions * Chapter 4: Of the social passions * Chapter 5: Of the selfish passions Smith starts off by noting that the spectator can sympathize only with passions of medium \\"pitch\\". However, this medium level at which the spectator can sympathize depends on what \\"passion\\" or emotion is being expressed; with some emotions even the most justified expression of cannot be tolerated at a high level of fervor, at others sympathy in the spectator is not bounded by magnitude of expression even though the emotion is not as well justified. Again, Smith emphasizes that specific passions will be considered appropriate or inappropriate to varying degrees depending on the degree to which the spectator is able to sympathize, and that it is the purpose of this section to specify which passions evoke sympathy and which do not and therefore which are deemed appropriate and not appropriate. Part I, Section II, Chapter I: Of the passions which take their origins from the body Since it is not possible to sympathize with bodily states or \\"appetites which take their origin in the body\\" it is improper to display them to others, according to Smith. One example is \\"eating voraciously\\" when hungry, as the impartial spectator can sympathize a little bit if there is a vivid description and good cause for this hunger, but not to a great extent as hunger itself cannot be induced from mere description. Smith also includes sex as a passion of the body that is considered indecent in the expression of others, although he does make note that to fail to treat a woman with more \\"gaiety, pleasantry, and attention\\" would also be improper of a man (p. 39). To express pain is also considered unbecoming. Smith believes the cause of lack of sympathy for these bodily passions is that \\"we cannot enter into them\\" ourselves (p. 40). Temperance, by Smith's account, is to have control over bodily passions. On the contrary, passions of the imagination, such as loss of love or ambition, are easy to sympathize with because our imagination can conform to the shape of the sufferer, whereas our body cannot do such a thing to the body of the sufferer. Pain is fleeting and the harm only lasts as long as the violence is inflicted, whereas an insult lasts to harm for longer duration because our imagination keeps mulling it over. Likewise, bodily pain that induces fear, such as a cut, wound or fracture, evoke sympathy because of the danger that they imply for ourselves; that is, sympathy is activated chiefly through imagining what it would be like for us. Part I, Section II, Chapter II: Of the passions which take their origins from a particular turn or habit of the imagination Passions which \\"take their origins from a particular turn or habit of the imagination\\" are \\"little sympathized with\\". These include love, as we are unlikely to enter into our own feeling of love in response to that of another person and thus unlikely to sympathize. He further states that love is \\"always laughed at, because we cannot enter into it\\" ourselves. Instead of inspiring love in ourselves, and thus sympathy, love makes the impartial spectator sensitive to the situation and emotions that may arise from the gain or loss of love. Again this is because it is easy to imagine hoping for love or dreading loss of love but not the actual experience of it, and that the \\"happy passion, upon this account, interests us much less than the fearful and the melancholy\\" of losing happiness (p. 49). Thus, love inspires sympathy for not for love itself but for the anticipation of emotions from gaining or losing it. Smith, however, finds love \\"ridiculous\\" but \\"not naturally odious\\" (p. 50). Thus, we sympathize with the \\"humaneness, generosity, kindness, friendship, and esteem\\" (p. 50) of love. However, as these secondary emotions are excessive in love, one should not express them but in moderate tones according to Smith, as: > All these are objects which we cannot expect should interest our companions > in the same degree in which they interest us. Failing to do so makes bad company, and therefore those with specific interests and \\"love\\" of hobbies should keep their passions to those with kindred spirits (\\"A philosopher is company to a philosopher only\\" (p. 51)) or to themselves. Part I, Section II, Chapter III: Of the unsocial passions Smith talks of hatred and resentment next, as \\"unsocial passions.\\" According to Smith these are passions of imagination, but sympathy is only likely to be evoked in the impartial spectator when they are expressed in moderate tones. Because these passions regard two people, namely the offended (resentful or angry person) and the offender, our sympathies are naturally drawn between these two. Specifically, although we sympathize with the offended person, we fear that the offended person may do harm to the offender, and thus also fear for and sympathize with the danger that faces the offender. The impartial spectator sympathizes with the offended person in a manner, as emphasized previously, such that the greatest sympathy occurs when the offended person expresses anger or resentment in a temperate manner. Specifically, if the offended person seems just and temperate in coping with the offense, then this magnifies the misdeed done to the offended in the mind of the spectator, increasing sympathy. Although excess anger does not beget sympathy, neither does too little anger, as this may signal fear or uncaring on the part of the offended. This lack of response is just as despicable to the impartial spectator as is the excesses of anger. However, in general, any expression of anger is improper in the presence of others. This is because the \\"immediate effects [of anger] are disagreeable\\" just as the knives of surgery are disagreeable for art, as the immediate effect of surgery is unpleasant even though long-term effect is justified. Likewise, even when anger is justly provoked, it is disagreeable. According to Smith, this explains why we reserve sympathy until we know the cause of the anger or resentment, since, if the emotion is not justified by the action of another person, then the immediate disagreeableness and threat to the other person (and by sympathy to ourselves) overwhelm any sympathy that the spectator may have for the offended. In response to expressions of anger, hatred, or resentment, it is likely that the impartial spectator will not feel anger in sympathy with the offended but instead anger toward the offended for expressing such an aversive. Smith believes that there is some form of natural optimality to the aversiveness of these emotions, as it reduces the propagation of ill will among people, and thus increases the probability of functional societies. Smith also puts forth that anger, hatred, and resentment are disagreeable to the offended mostly because of the idea of being offended rather than the actual offense itself. He remarks that we are likely able to do without what was taken from us, but it is the imagination which angers us at the thought of having something taken. Smith closes this section by remarking that the impartial spectator will not sympathize with us unless we are willing to endure harms, with the goal of maintaining positive social relations and humanity, with equanimity, as long as it does not put us in a situation of being \\"exposed to perpetual insults\\" (p. 59). It is only \\"with reluctance, from necessity, and in consequence of great and repeated provocations\\" (p. 60) that we should take revenge on others. Smith makes clear that we should take very good care to not act on the passions of anger, hatred, resentment, for purely social reasons, and instead imagine what the impartial spectator would deem appropriate, and base our action solely on a cold calculation. Part I, Section II, Chapter IV: Of the social passions The social emotions such as \\"generosity, humanity, kindness, compassion, mutual friendship and esteem\\" are considered overwhelmingly with approbation by the impartial spectator. The agreeableness of the \\"benevolent\\" sentiments leads to full sympathy on the part of the spectator with both the person concerned and the object of these emotions and are not felt as aversive to the spectator if they are in excess. Part I, Section II, Chapter V: Of the selfish passions The final set of passions, or \\"selfish passions\\", are grief and joy, which Smith considers to be not so aversive as the unsocial passions of anger and resentment, but not so benevolent as the social passions such as generosity and humanity. Smith makes clear in this passage that the impartial spectator is unsympathetic to the unsocial emotions because they put the offended and the offender in opposition to each other, sympathetic to the social emotions because they join the lover and beloved in unison, and feels somewhere in between with the selfish passions as they are either good or bad for only one person and are not disagreeable but not so magnificent as the social emotions. Of grief and joy, Smith notes that small joys and great grief are assured to be returned with sympathy from the impartial spectator, but not other degrees of these emotions. Great joy is likely to be met with envy, so modesty is prudent for someone who has come upon great fortune or else suffer the consequences of envy and disapprobation. This is appropriate as the spectator appreciates the lucky individual's \\"sympathy with our envy and aversion to his happiness\\" especially because this shows concern for the inability of the spectator to reciprocate the sympathy toward the happiness of the lucky individual. According to Smith, this modesty wears on the sympathy of both the lucky individual and the old friends of the lucky individual and they soon part ways; likewise, the lucky individual may acquire new friends of higher rank to whom he must also be modest, apologizing for the \\"mortification\\" of now being their equal: > He generally grows weary too soon, and is provoked, by the sullen and > suspicious pride of the one, and by the saucy contempt of the other, to > treat the first with neglect, and the second with petulance, till at last he > grows habitually insolent, and forfeits the esteem of them all... those > sudden changes of fortune seldom contribute much to happiness (p. 66). The solution is to ascend social rank by gradual steps, with the path cleared for one by approbation before one takes the next step, giving people time to adjust, and thus avoiding any \\"jealousy in those he overtakes, or any envy in those he leaves behind\\" (p. 66). Small joys of everyday life are met with sympathy and approbation according to Smith. These \\"frivolous nothings which fill up the void of human life\\" (p. 67) divert attention and help us forget problems, reconciling us as with a lost friend. The opposite is true for grief, with small grief triggering no sympathy in the impartial spectator, but large grief with much sympathy. Small griefs are likely, and appropriately, turned into joke and mockery by the sufferer, as the sufferer knows how complaining about small grievances to the impartial spectator will evoke ridicule in the heart of the spectator, and thus the sufferer sympathizes with this, mocking himself to some degree. Part I, Section III Of the effects of prosperity and adversity upon the judgment of mankind with regard to the propriety of action; and why it is more easy to obtain their approbation in the one state than in the other Chapter 2 :Of the origin of Ambition, and of the distinction of Ranks The rich man glories in his riches, because he feels that they naturally draw upon him the attention of the world, and that mankind are disposed to go along with him in all those agreeable emotions with which the advantages of his situation so readily inspire him. At the thought of this, his heart seems to swell and dilate itself within him, and he is fonder of his wealth, upon this account, than for all the other advantages it procures him. The poor man, on the contrary, is ashamed of his poverty. He feels that it either places him out of the sight of mankind, or, that if they take any notice of him, they have, however, scarce any fellow- feeling with the misery and distress which he suffers. Great King, live for ever! is the compliment, which, after the manner of eastern adulation, we should readily make them, if experience did not teach us its absurdity. Every calamity that befalls them, every injury that is done them, excites in the breast of the spectator ten times more compassion and resentment than he would have felt, had the same things happened to other men.A stranger to human nature, who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their inferiors, and the regret and indignation which they feel for the misfortunes and sufferings of those above them, would be apt to imagine, that pain must be more agonizing, and the convulsions of death more terrible to persons of higher rank, than to those of meaner stations. Upon this disposition of mankind, to go along with all the passions of the rich and the powerful, is founded the distinction of ranks, and the order of society. Even when the people have been brought this length, they are apt to relent every moment, and easily relapse into their habitual state of deference to those whom they have been accustomed to look upon as their natural superiors. They cannot stand the mortification of their monarch. Compassion soon takes the place of resentment, they forget all past provocations, their old principles of loyalty revive, and they run to re-establish the ruined authority of their old masters, with the same violence with which they had opposed it. The death of Charles I brought about the Restoration of the royal family. Compassion for James II when he was seized by the populace in making his escape on ship-board, had almost prevented the Revolution, and made it go on more heavily than before. Chapter 3 : Of the corruption of our moral sentiments, which is occasioned by this disposition to admire the rich and the great, and to despise or neglect persons of poor and mean condition This disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful, and to despise, or, at least, to neglect persons of poor and mean condition, though necessary both to establish and to maintain the distinction of ranks and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments. That wealth and greatness are often regarded with the respect and admiration which are due only to wisdom and virtue; and that the contempt, of which vice and folly are the only proper objects, is often most unjustly bestowed upon poverty and weakness, has been the complaint of moralists in all ages. We desire both to be respectable and to be respected. We dread both to be contemptible and to be contemned. But, upon coming into the world, we soon find that wisdom and virtue are by no means the sole objects of respect; nor vice and folly, of contempt. We frequently see the respectful attentions of the world more strongly directed towards the rich and the great, than towards the wise and the virtuous. We see frequently the vices and follies of the powerful much less despised than the poverty and weakness of the innocent. To deserve, to acquire, and to enjoy the respect and admiration of mankind, are the great objects of ambition and emulation. Two different roads are presented to us, equally leading to the attainment of this so much desired object; the one, by the study of wisdom and the practice of virtue; the other, by the acquisition of wealth and greatness. Two different characters are presented to our emulation; the one, of proud ambition and ostentatious avidity. the other, of humble modesty and equitable justice. Two different models, two different pictures, are held out to us, according to which we may fashion our own character and behaviour; the one more gaudy and glittering in its colouring; the other more correct and more exquisitely beautiful in its outline: the one forcing itself upon the notice of every wandering eye; the other, attracting the attention of scarce any body but the most studious and careful observer. They are the wise and the virtuous chiefly, a select, though, I am afraid, but a small party, who are the real and steady admirers of wisdom and virtue. The great mob of mankind are the admirers and worshippers, and, what may seem more extraordinary, most frequently the disinterested admirers and worshippers, of wealth and greatness. n the superior stations of life the case is unhappily not always the same. In the courts of princes, in the drawing-rooms of the great, where success and preferment depend, not upon the esteem of intelligent and well-informed equals, but upon the fanciful and foolish favour of ignorant, presumptuous, and proud superiors; flattery and falsehood too often prevail over merit and abilities. In such societies the abilities to please, are more regarded than the abilities to serve. In quiet and peaceable times, when the storm is at a distance, the prince, or great man, wishes only to be amused, and is even apt to fancy that he has scarce any occasion for the service of any body, or that those who amuse him are sufficiently able to serve him. The external graces, the frivolous accomplishments of that impertinent and foolish thing called a man of fashion, are commonly more admired than the solid and masculine virtues of a warrior, a statesman, a philosopher, or a legislator. All the great and awful virtues, all the virtues which can fit, either for the council, the senate, or the field, are, by the insolent and insignificant flatterers, who commonly figure the most in such corrupted societies, held in the utmost contempt and derision. When the duke of Sully was called upon by Lewis the Thirteenth, to give his advice in some great emergency, he observed the favourites and courtiers whispering to one another, and smiling at his unfashionable appearance. 'Whenever your majesty's father,' said the old warrior and statesman, 'did me the honour to consult me, he ordered the buffoons of the court to retire into the antechamber.' It is from our disposition to admire, and consequently to imitate, the rich and the great, that they are enabled to set, or to lead what is called the fashion. Their dress is the fashionable dress; the language of their conversation, the fashionable style; their air and deportment, the fashionable behaviour. Even their vices and follies are fashionable; and the greater part of men are proud to imitate and resemble them in the very qualities which dishonour and degrade them. Vain men often give themselves airs of a fashionable profligacy, which, in their hearts, they do not approve of, and of which, perhaps, they are really not guilty. They desire to be praised for what they themselves do not think praise-worthy, and are ashamed of unfashionable virtues which they sometimes practise in secret, and for which they have secretly some degree of real veneration. There are hypocrites of wealth and greatness, as well as of religion and virtue; and a vain man is as apt to pretend to be what he is not, in the one way, as a cunning man is in the other. He assumes the equipage and splendid way of living of his superiors, without considering that whatever may be praise-worthy in any of these, derives its whole merit and propriety from its suitableness to that situation and fortune which both require and can easily support the expence. Many a poor man places his glory in being thought rich, without considering that the duties (if one may call such follies by so very venerable a name) which that reputation imposes upon him, must soon reduce him to beggary, and render his situation still more unlike that of those whom he admires and imitates, than it had been originally. ===Part V, Chapter I: Of the influence of Custom and Fashion upon the Sentiments of Approbation and Disapprobation=== Smith argues that two principles, custom and fashion, pervasively influence judgment. These are based on the modern psychological concept of associativity: Stimuli presented closely in time or space become mentally linked over time and repeated exposure. In Smith's own words: > When two objects have frequently been seen together, the imagination > requires a habit of passing easily from one to the other. If the first is to > appear, we lay our account that the second is to follow. Of their own accord > they put us in mind of one another, and the attention glides easily along > them. (p. 1) Regarding custom, Smith argues that approbation occurs when stimuli are presented according to how one is accustomed to viewing them and disapprobation occurs when they are presented in a way that one is not accustomed to. Thus, Smith argues for social relativity of judgment meaning that beauty and correctness are determined more by what one has previously been exposed to rather than an absolute principle. Although Smith places greater weight on this social determination he does not discount absolute principles completely, instead he argues that evaluations are rarely inconsistent with custom, therefore giving greater weight to customs than absolutes: > I cannot, however, be induced to believe that our sense of external beauty > is founded altogether on custom...But though I cannot admit that custom is > the sole principle of beauty, yet I can so far allow the truth of this > ingenious system as to grant, that there is scarce any one external form to > please, if quite contrary to custom...(pp. 14–15). Smith continues by arguing that fashion is a particular \\"species\\" of custom. Fashion is specifically the association of stimuli with people of high rank, for example, a certain type of clothes with a notable person such as a king or a renowned artist. This is because the \\"graceful, easy, and commanding manners of the great\\" (p. 3) person are frequently associated with the other aspects of the person of high rank (e.g., clothes, manners), thus bestowing upon the other aspects the \\"graceful\\" quality of the person. In this way objects become fashionable. Smith includes not only clothes and furniture in the sphere of fashion, but also taste, music, poetry, architecture, and physical beauty. Smith also points out that people should be relatively reluctant to change styles from what they are accustomed to even if a new style is equal to or slightly better than current fashion: \\"A man would be ridiculous who should appear in public with a suit of clothes quite different from those which are commonly worn, though the new dress be ever so graceful or convenient\\" (p. 7). Physical beauty, according to Smith, is also determined by the principle of custom. He argues that each \\"class\\" of things has a \\"peculiar conformation which is approved of\\" and that the beauty of each member of a class is determined by the extent to which it has the most \\"usual\\" manifestation of that \\"conformation\\": > Thus, in the human form, the beauty of each feature lies in a certain > middle, equally removed from a variety of other forms that are ugly. (pp. > 10–11). ===Part V, Chapter II: Of the influence of Custom and Fashion upon Moral Sentiments=== Smith argues that the influence of custom is reduced in the sphere of moral judgment. Specifically, he argues that there are bad things that no custom can bring approbation to: > But the characters and conduct of a Nero, or a Claudius, are what no custom > will ever reconcile us to, what no fashion will ever render agreeable; but > the one will always be the object of dread and hatred; the other of scorn > and derision. (pp. 15–16). Smith further argues for a \\"natural\\" right and wrong, and that custom amplifies the moral sentiments when one's customs are consistent with nature, but dampens moral sentiments when one's customs are inconsistent with nature. Fashion also has an effect on moral sentiment. The vices of people of high rank, such as the licentiousness of Charles VIII, are associated with the \\"freedom and independency, with frankness, generosity, humanity, and politeness\\" of the \\"superiors\\" and thus the vices are endued with these characteristics. ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== * Bonar, J.

This is different from unspecified behavior, for which the language specification does not prescribe a result and implementation defined behavior that defers to the documentation of another component of the platform (such as the ABI or the translator documentation). In the C community, undefined behavior may be humorously referred to as \\"nasal demons\\", after a comp.std.c post that explained undefined behavior as allowing the compiler to do anything it chooses, even \\"to make demons fly out of your nose\\". == Overview == Some programming languages allow a program to operate differently or even have a different control flow than the source code, as long as it exhibits the same user- visible side effects, if undefined behavior never happens during program execution. Undefined behavior is the name of a list of conditions that the program must not meet. In the early versions of C, undefined behavior's primary advantage was the production of performant compilers for a wide variety of machines: a specific construct could be mapped to a machine- specific feature, and the compiler did not have to generate additional code for the runtime to adapt the side effects to match semantics imposed by the language. The program source code was written with prior knowledge of the specific compiler and of the platforms that it would support. However, progressive standardization of the platforms has made this less of an advantage, especially in newer versions of C. Now, the cases for undefined behavior typically represent unambiguous bugs in the code, for example indexing an array outside of its bounds. By definition, the runtime can assume that undefined behavior never happens; therefore, some invalid conditions do not need to be checked against. For a compiler, this also means that various program transformations become valid, or their proofs of correctness are simplified; this allows for various kinds of premature optimization and micro- optimization, which lead to incorrect behavior if the program state meets any of such conditions. The compiler can also remove explicit checks that may have been in the source code, without notifying the programmer; for example, detecting undefined behavior by testing whether it happened is not guaranteed to work, by definition. This makes it hard or impossible to program a portable fail-safe option (non-portable solutions are possible for some constructs). Current compiler development usually evaluates and compares compiler performance with benchmarks designed around micro-optimizations, even on platforms that are mostly used on the general-purpose desktop and laptop market (such as amd64). Therefore, undefined behavior provides ample room for compiler performance improvement, as the source code for a specific source code statement is allowed to be mapped to anything at runtime. For C and C++, the compiler is allowed to give a compile-time diagnostic in these cases, but is not required to: the implementation will be considered correct whatever it does in such cases, analogous to don't-care terms in digital logic. It is the responsibility of the programmer to write code that never invokes undefined behavior, although compiler implementations are allowed to issue diagnostics when this happens. Compilers nowadays have flags that enable such diagnostics, for example, \`-fsanitize\` enables the \\"undefined behavior sanitizer\\" (UBSan) in gcc 4.9GCC Undefined Behavior Sanitizer – ubsan and in clang. However, this flag is not the default and enabling it is a choice of who builds the code. Under some circumstances there can be specific restrictions on undefined behavior. For example, the instruction set specifications of a CPU might leave the behavior of some forms of an instruction undefined, but if the CPU supports memory protection then the specification will probably include a blanket rule stating that no user-accessible instruction may cause a hole in the operating system's security; so an actual CPU would be permitted to corrupt user registers in response to such an instruction, but would not be allowed to, for example, switch into supervisor mode. The runtime platform can also provide some restrictions or guarantees on undefined behavior, if the toolchain or the runtime explicitly document that specific constructs found in the source code are mapped to specific well-defined mechanisms available at runtime. For example, an interpreter may document a certain behavior for some operations that are undefined in the language specification, while other interpreters or compilers for the same language may not. A compiler produces executable code for a specific ABI, filling the semantic gap in ways that depend on the compiler version: the documentation for that compiler version and the ABI specification can provide restrictions on undefined behavior. Relying on these implementation details makes the software non-portable, however portability may not be a concern if the software is not supposed to be used outside of a specific runtime. Undefined behavior can result in a program crash or even in failures that are harder to detect and make the program look like it is working normally, such as silent loss of data and production of incorrect results. == Benefits == Documenting an operation as undefined behavior allows compilers to assume that this operation will never happen in a conforming program. This gives the compiler more information about the code and this information can lead to more optimization opportunities. An example for the C language: int foo(unsigned char x) { int value = 2147483600; /* assuming 32-bit int and 8-bit char */ value += x; if (value < 2147483600) bar(); return value; } The value of \`x\` cannot be negative and, given that signed integer overflow is undefined behavior in C, the compiler can assume that \`value < 2147483600\` will always be false. Thus the \`if\` statement, including the call to the function \`bar\`, can be ignored by the compiler since the test expression in the \`if\` has no side effects and its condition will never be satisfied. The code is therefore semantically equivalent to: int foo(unsigned char x) { int value = 2147483600; value += x; return value; } Had the compiler been forced to assume that signed integer overflow has wraparound behavior, then the transformation above would not have been legal. Such optimizations become hard to spot by humans when the code is more complex and other optimizations, like inlining, take place. For example, another function may call the above function: void run_tasks(unsigned char *ptrx) { int z; z = foo(*ptrx); while (*ptrx > 60) { run_one_task(ptrx, z); } } The compiler is free to optimize away the \`while\`-loop here by applying value range analysis: by inspecting \`foo()\`, it knows that the initial value pointed to by \`ptrx\` cannot possibly exceed 47 (as any more would trigger undefined behavior in \`foo()\`), therefore the initial check of \`*ptrx > 60\` will always be false in a conforming program. Going further, since the result \`z\` is now never used and \`foo()\` has no side effects, the compiler can optimize \`run_tasks()\` to be an empty function that returns immediately. The disappearance of the \`while\`-loop may be especially surprising if \`foo()\` is defined in a separately compiled object file. Another benefit from allowing signed integer overflow to be undefined is that it makes it possible to store and manipulate a variable's value in a processor register that is larger than the size of the variable in the source code. For example, if the type of a variable as specified in the source code is narrower than the native register width (such as \\"int\\" on a 64-bit machine, a common scenario), then the compiler can safely use a signed 64-bit integer for the variable in the machine code it produces, without changing the defined behavior of the code. If a program depended on the behavior of a 32-bit integer overflow, then a compiler would have to insert additional logic when compiling for a 64-bit machine, because the overflow behavior of most machine instructions depends on the register width.https://gist.github.com/rygorous/e0f055bfb74e3d5f0af20690759de5a7#file- gistfile1-txt-L166 Undefined behavior also allows more compile-time checks by both compilers and static program analysis. == Risks == C and C++ standards have several forms of undefined behavior throughout, which offer increased liberty in compiler implementations and compile-time checks at the expense of undefined run-time behavior if present. In particular, the ISO standard for C has an appendix listing common sources of undefined behavior.ISO/IEC 9899:2011 §J.2. Moreover, compilers are not required to diagnose code that relies on undefined behavior. Hence, it is common for programmers, even experienced ones, to rely on undefined behavior either by mistake, or simply because they are not well-versed in the rules of the language that can span hundreds of pages. This can result in bugs that are exposed when a different compiler, or different settings, are used. Testing or fuzzing with dynamic undefined behavior checks enabled, e.g., the Clang sanitizers, can help to catch undefined behavior not diagnosed by the compiler or static analyzers. Undefined behavior can lead to security vulnerabilities in software. For example, buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities in the major web browsers are due to undefined behavior. The Year 2038 problem is another example due to signed integer overflow. When GCC's developers changed their compiler in 2008 such that it omitted certain overflow checks that relied on undefined behavior, CERT issued a warning against the newer versions of the compiler. Linux Weekly News pointed out that the same behavior was observed in PathScale C, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 and several other compilers; the warning was later amended to warn about various compilers. == Examples in C and C++ == The major forms of undefined behavior in C can be broadly classified as: spatial memory safety violations, temporal memory safety violations, integer overflow, strict aliasing violations, alignment violations, unsequenced modifications, data races, and loops that neither perform I/O nor terminate. In C the use of any automatic variable before it has been initialized yields undefined behavior, as does integer division by zero, signed integer overflow, indexing an array outside of its defined bounds (see buffer overflow), or null pointer dereferencing. In general, any instance of undefined behavior leaves the abstract execution machine in an unknown state, and causes the behavior of the entire program to be undefined. Attempting to modify a string literal causes undefined behavior:ISO/IEC (2003).

The following example will however cause undefined behavior in both C++ and C. i = i++ + 1; // undefined behavior When modifying an object between two sequence points, reading the value of the object for any other purpose than determining the value to be stored is also undefined behavior.ISO/IEC (1999).

The safest way (regardless of compiler vendor) is to always keep the number of bits to shift (the right operand of the \`<<\` and \`>>\` bitwise operators) within the range: <\`0, sizeof(value)*CHAR_BIT - 1\`> (where \`value\` is the left operand). int num = -1; unsigned int val = 1 << num; //shifting by a negative number - undefined behavior num = 32; //or whatever number greater than 31 val = 1 << num; //the literal '1' is typed as a 32-bit integer - in this case shifting by more than 31 bits is undefined behavior num = 64; //or whatever number greater than 63 unsigned long long val2 = 1ULL << num; //the literal '1ULL' is typed as a 64-bit integer - in this case shifting by more than 63 bits is undefined behavior == See also == * Compiler * Halt and Catch Fire * Unspecified behavior == References == ==Further reading== * Peter van der Linden, Expert C Programming. * UB Canaries (April 2015), John Regehr (University of Utah, USA) * Undefined Behavior in 2017 (July 2017) Pascal Cuoq (TrustInSoft, France) and John Regehr (University of Utah, USA) == External links == * Corrected version of the C99 standard.

In the UK, Krypton Force released several of these programmes but under different series titles. ==Force Five series== Force Five consisted of the following five series: *Force Five: Gaiking (26 episodes), adaptation of Divine Demon-Dragon Gaiking (44 episodes) *Force Five: Dangard Ace (26 episodes), adaptation of Planetary Robot Danguard Ace (56 episodes) *Force Five: Starvengers (26 episodes), adaptation of Getter Robo G (39 episodes) *Force Five: Grandizer (26 episodes), adaptation of UFO Robot Grendizer (74 episodes) *Force Five: Spaceketeers (26 episodes), adaptation of Sci-Fi West Saga Starzinger (73 episodes) Originally, Great Mazinger was meant to be among the 5 shows, but at the last minute was swapped out for Starzinger. ==References== ==External links== * Absolute Anime profile Force Five Television show Category:1980 American television series debuts Category:1985 American television series endings Category:1970s Japanese television series Category:1980s American animated television series Category:American children's animated anthology television series Category:English-language television shows Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:Mecha anime and manga Category:American television series based on Japanese television series ","title":"Force Five"},{"id":"515999","text":"Brokaw bandgap reference is a voltage reference circuit widely used in integrated circuits, with an output voltage around 1.25 V with low temperature dependence. This particular circuit is one type of a bandgap voltage reference, named after Paul Brokaw, the author of its first publication.Brokaw, P., \\"A simple three-terminal IC bandgap reference\\", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 9, pp. 388-393, December 1974. The theoretical circuit of a Brokaw bandgap Like all temperature-independent bandgap references, the circuit maintains an internal voltage source that has a positive temperature coefficient and another internal voltage source that has a negative temperature coefficient. By summing the two together, the temperature dependence can be canceled. Additionally, either of the two internal sources can be used as a temperature sensor. In the Brokaw bandgap reference, the circuit uses negative feedback (by means of an operational amplifier) to force a constant current through two bipolar transistors with different emitter areas. By the Ebers–Moll model of a transistor, * The transistor with the larger emitter area requires a smaller base–emitter voltage for the same current. * The difference between the two base–emitter voltages has a positive temperature coefficient (i.e., it increases with temperature). * The base–emitter voltage for each transistor has a negative temperature coefficient (i.e., it decreases with temperature). The circuit output is the sum of one of the base-emitter voltages with a multiple of the base–emitter voltage differences. With appropriate component choices, the two opposing temperature coefficients will cancel each other exactly and the output will have no temperature dependence. In the example circuit shown, the opamp ensures that its inverting and non-inverting inputs are at the same voltage. This means that the currents in each collector resistor are identical, so the collector currents of Q1 and Q2 are also identical. If Q2 has an emitter area that is N times larger than Q1, its base-emitter voltage will be lower than that of Q1 by a magnitude of kT/q*ln(N). This voltage is generated across R2 and so defines the current I in each leg as kT/q*ln(N)/R2. The output voltage (at the opamp output) is therefore VBE(Q1) + 2*I*R1, or VBE(Q1)+2*kT/q*ln(N)*R1/R2. The first (VBE) term has a negative temperature coefficient; the second term has a positive temperature coefficient (from the T term). By an appropriate choice of N and R1 and R2, these temperature coefficients can be made to cancel, giving an output voltage that is nearly independent of temperature. The magnitude of this output voltage can be shown to be approximately equal to the bandgap voltage (EG0) of Silicon extrapolated to 0 K. ==See also== * LM317 ==References== ==External links== * Original IEEE paper(pdf) — This is the 1974 paper describing the circuit. * A Transistor Voltage Reference, and What the Band-Gap Has To Do With It — This 1989 video features Paul Brokaw explaining his bandgap voltage reference. * How to make a Bandgap Voltage Reference in One Easy Lesson by A.

It is a sequel to Rainbow Islands and the third game in the Bubble Bobble series. ==Gameplay== Parasol Stars PC Engine Screenshot Bubby and Bobby (the characters' human names) star once again as the main characters, retaining their human forms from Rainbow Islands. However, Parasol Stars is more of a take on Bubble Bobble than it is on Rainbow Islands. The game takes place on a number of different worlds, each with a distinct theme. Each world features seven rounds, the last one always hosting a boss that must be defeated to progress to the next world. There are eight main worlds; however, in order to complete the game properly, the player must open a secret door on the final world by collecting three of the Star items - allowing access to 2 secret worlds, themed around Bubble Bobble and Chack'n Pop that are not initially visible on the main screen. Completing these two lead to the final boss, Chaostikhan (the one responsible for stealing color from the worlds, and supposedly the mastermind behind the previous game's villains) and the true ending. According to an ACE magazine in-depth preview, the Amiga version also has a secret \\"Nightmare\\" world. The player is armed with a parasol. While it is normally closed, the player can deploy it in two ways; either open in front of them, or open above the head. The parasol is a multipurpose device, it can block as a shield, stun enemies, capture droplets or hurl enemies. At many points it can be used as a parachute. The rounds are simple arrangements of platforms. Almost every level has droplets which drip from points in the level. They fall under the influence of gravity and roll along the platforms within the screen. The player can capture these on their parasol and throw them at enemies. The parasol can hold more than one droplet at once; if five are held, they merge into a large droplet with a special power. There are four different kinds of droplets, with a mostly elemental theme, some of which are inherited from Bubble Bobble. ==Release== Unlike many other games in the series, Parasol Stars was never released to arcades \\\\- it was originally developed for the NEC PC Engine, and later converted to a number of other home systems. Parasol Stars was misreported as being the third coin-op in the Bubble Bobble series by many magazines at the time, and there are rumours about prototypes for an arcade version. Taito has officially stated that an arcade game was never produced. Mick West (who was the programmer of the Amiga and Atari ST versions) stated that they ported the game directly from the PC Engine by playing it and that he did not know anything about an arcade version. The game was released in limited quantities in North America for the TurboGrafx-16 by Working Designs. The Game Boy and NES version were published by Ocean Software in 1991, who also published the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST versions in 1992. A ZX Spectrum port was planned, but later cancelled. The game was also planned for the Commodore 64, but it was cancelled as well. Ocean initially explained that the developer's computer was stolen in a burglary, but it was later revealed that the game was scrapped after the freelance developer's wife destroyed said computer in a drunken rage, along with the backups of the work. The compilation release Bubble Bobble featuring Rainbow Islands for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and PC was originally going to include Parasol Stars as well, but it was dropped from the lineup mid-development. ==Relation to other games== The game's subtitle is The Story of Bubble Bobble III, which was also used as the subtitle for Bubble Memories, released in arcades in 1995. Bubble Memories is a prequel (given the \\"Memories\\" part of the name) to the 1994 game Bubble Symphony, which was released as Bubble Bobble 2 in some countries. Nonetheless, Rainbow Islands is indeed the sequel to the original Bubble Bobble, even though said sequel doesn't retain the gameplay from the first. Since Bubble Memories was released years after Parasol Stars, it may be a retcon in which Parasol Stars never happened, whereby after the events of Rainbow Islands, the humans Bubby and Bobby are once again transformed into the bubble dragons Bubblun and Bobblun. However, it's also possible that Parasol Stars could be a side story, or \\"gaiden\\" to the series occurring after Rainbow Islands, but before Bubble Memories. The game has also been released as Parasol Stars: Rainbow Islands II, such as on the NES. ==Use of Lambada== Much like Rainbow Islands used The Wizard of Ozs song \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", Parasol Stars used an official song in its soundtrack. This time it was \\"Lambada\\" by the French-Brazilian pop group Kaoma, which was used as the game's boss theme. ==Reception== CU Amiga praised the game, giving it 95% and a \\"Super Star\\". Amiga Power was a little less enthusiastic, giving it 88%. Entertainment Weekly picked the game as the #15 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \\"This one’s even more fun to play than it is to describe: Bubby (or Bobby when two play simultaneously) uses his umbrella to flick bizarre meanies across the screen and turn them into pieces of cake, apples, mushrooms, etc., which he then gobbles up in order to earn points.\\"https://ew.com/article/1991/11/22/video-games-guide/ ==References== ==External links== *Parasol Stars at the Arcade History database Category:1991 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Bubble Bobble Category:Game Boy games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Ocean Software games Category:Platform games Category:Taito games Category:TurboGrafx-16 games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games ","title":"Parasol Stars"},{"id":"516016","text":"Sitia () is a port town and a municipality in Lasithi, Crete, Greece. The town has 9,912 inhabitants (2011) and the municipality has 18,318 (2011). It lies east of Agios Nikolaos and northeast of Ierapetra. Sitia port is on the Sea of Crete, part of the Aegean SeaPeter Saundry, C. Michael Hogan & Steve Baum. 2011. Sea of Crete. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds.M.Pidwirny & C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and Environment. Washington DC. and is one of the economic centers of the Lasithi region. European route E75, which ends in Vardø, starts in Sitia. Sitia is served by the Sitia Public Airport. Sitia has not experienced the effects of mass tourism even though there is a long beach along the road leading to Vai and several places of historical interest. ==GeographyMunicipality=== The municipality Sitia was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities which became municipal units:Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior *Itanos *Lefki, Lasithi *Sitia The municipality has an area of , the municipal unit . ===Province=== The province of Siteia () was one of the provinces of Lasithi. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Siteia and the municipal unit Makry Gialos. It was abolished in 2006. ===Environmentally protected areas=== There are a number of sites in the municipality of Sitia that are protected as National Parks, Aesthetic Forests, Wildlife Refuges etc. under national and international laws. Notable examples are: *Dionysades Islands which carry many rare and endangered plant species and also serve as a refuge of several animal species (mostly birds and small reptiles), including the falcon, Falco eleonorae, which finds sanctuary here. *Vai Palm Forest. *Richtis Gorge and waterfall.Richtis Gorge and Waterfall ===Climate=== ==History== Kazarma fortress at the top View of the marina The settlement of the town dates to pre-Minoan times. Excavations in the Petras neighbourhood have found architectural remains from the end of the Neolithic (3000 BC) and continue through the Bronze Age 3000-1050 BC, including the Minoan palace of Petras. Several other Minoan settlements have been found within the municipality, notably Itanos and Mochlos. According to Diogenes Laërtius, Sitia was the home of Myson of Chen, one of the Seven Sages of Greece. ===Etymology=== The ancient Ητεία, written as Itia or Etea in English,John Freely, Crete: Discovering the 'Great Island , p. 154 appears to correspond roughly to modern Sitia. The name Sitia itself is probably the result of rebracketing of the prefix \\"s-\\" < σε 'at' + Ητεία.Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, Travels and Researches in Crete, 1865, chapter XIX, p. 201 ===Ancient Sitia=== Sitia was founded by Minoans as Iteia, and was a centre of refuge for native Cretans after the fall of the major Minoan settlements. The city continued to prosper through the Classical, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods as one of the island's chief ports. ===Venetian Era=== The town was later expanded and fortified by the Venetians after their acquisition of Crete in 1204, who used it as a base of operations for the Eastern Mediterranean. During the Venetian occupation, the town was destroyed three times: first by an earthquake in 1508, then by the Turkish pirate Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1538, and finally by the Venetians themselves in 1651. This final destruction took place in the context of the Cretan War (1645–1669) in which the Venetians battled to retain their hold on the island against the Ottoman Empire. While Sitia did not fall in the initial Turkish advance the Venetians did not have the resources to withstand a long siege, and accordingly destroyed the fortifications and removed the garrison to Heraklion. The local inhabitants meanwhile removed westwards to Liopetro and the site was subsequently abandoned for the next 200 years of Turkish rule. The main remnant of the Venetian occupation is the Kazarma (from Italian casa di arma), the old fortress overlooking the harbour. ===Modern Era=== After the Venetian period and subsequent abandonment the town was rebuilt until 1870 by the progressive Turkish governor Hüseyin Avni Pasha following the Cretan Revolt. It was subsequently created capital of the Sanjak of Lasit (later Lasithi, which it remains to this day). Under Turkish rule the town was renamed Avniye in honour of its rebuilder, but as the local Greeks continued to use the traditional named of Sitia this innovation did not survive Independence. Despite the turbulent history of Crete in leaving the Ottoman Empire and joining Greece, as well as the First World War, the population almost quadrupled between 1881 (570 inhabitants) and 1928 (2,100 inhabitants). Major public works were carried out by the Greek government in 1911 to modernise the town, in the course of which much of the Ottoman era town was rebuilt, as well as a fresh water supply. ==Infrastructure== The municipality of Sitia is served by the Sitia Public Airport which offers several domestic destinations. The first landing occurred on June 7, 1984 and the airport opened officially on June 9, 1984. Construction of new building facilities that included a control tower was completed in May 1993. Runway and apron extension works were finished in May 2003.

She has been described by critic Gary GiddinsGiddins, Gary. (2000). Visions of Jazz: The First Century. Oxford University Press, , p. 643. as \\"a singer blessed with an unmistakable timbre and attack [who has] expanded the playing field\\" by incorporating blues, country, and folk music into her work. ==Early life and career== Cassandra Wilson is the third and youngest child of Herman Fowlkes, Jr., a guitarist, bassist, and music teacher;Litweiler, John. Cassandra Wilson, Encyclopædia Britannica Online and Mary McDaniel, an elementary school teacher who earned her PhD in education. Her ancestry includes Fon, Yoruba, Irish and Welsh. Between her mother’s love for Motown and her father’s dedication to jazz, Wilson’s parents sparked her early interest in music.Leland, John. GOING HOME WITH: Cassandra Wilson; Jazz Diva Follows Sound of Her Roots, The New York Times, March 7, 2002 Wilson’s earliest formal musical education consisted of classical lessons; she studied piano from the age of six to thirteen and played clarinet in the middle school concert and marching bands. When she was tired of this training, she asked her father to teach her the guitar. Instead, he gave her a lesson in self-reliance, suggesting she study Mel Bay method books. Wilson explored guitar on her own, developing what she has described as an \\"intuitive\\" approach. During this time she began writing her own songs, adopting a folk style. She also appeared in the musical theater productions, including The Wizard of Oz as Dorothy, crossing racial lines in a recently desegregated school system. Wilson attended Millsaps College and Jackson State University. She graduated with a degree in mass communications. Outside of the classroom, she spent her nights working with R&B;, funk, and pop cover bands, also singing in local coffeehouses. The Black Arts Music Society, founded by John Reese and Alvin Fielder, provided her with her first opportunities to perform bebop. In 2007, Wilson received her Ph.D in Arts from Millsaps College. In 1981, she moved to New Orleans for a position as assistant public affairs director for the local television station, WDSU. She did not stay long. Working with mentors who included elder statesmen Earl Turbinton, Alvin Batiste, and Ellis Marsalis, Wilson found encouragement to seriously pursue jazz performance and moved to New York City the following year. ==Musical association with M-Base== In New York, Wilson's focus turned towards improvisation. Heavily influenced by singers Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter, she fine-tuned her vocal phrasing and scat while studying ear training with trombonist Grachan Moncur, III. Frequenting jam sessions under the tutelage of pianist Sadik Hakim, a Charlie Parker alumnus, she met alto saxophonist Steve Coleman, who encouraged her to look beyond the standard jazz repertoire in favor of developing original material. She would become the vocalist and one of the founding members of the M-Base collective in which Coleman was the leading figure, a stylistic outgrowth of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and Black Artists Group (BAG) that re-imagined the grooves of funk and soul within the context of traditional and avant-garde jazz. Peter Watrous in an article for The New York Times states: > The M-Base group in Brooklyn, working with both jazz and pop forms, makes > music that at first sounds like funk from the 1970s. Like the music played > by Mr. Marsalis (and his brother Wynton) the music made by M-Base - Steve > Coleman, with Greg Osby, Cassandra Wilson and Geri Allen – is, at its best, > filled with subtle ideas working behind the mask of popular music. In Mr. > Coleman's group a singer is supported by an electric bass, guitar, drums and > electric keyboards, a shiny musical mix that has familiar rock and funk > references; yet, because of all its rhythmic and metric manipulations, > sounds new. Although the voice – typically treated as the focal point of any arrangement in which it is included – was not an obvious choice for M-Base's complex textures or harmonically elaborated melodies, Wilson wove herself into the fabric of these settings with wordless improv and lyrics. She can be heard on Coleman's debut as a leader Motherland Pulse (1985), then as member of his Five Elements on On the Edge of Tomorrow (1986), World Expansion (1986), Sine Die (1987), and on M-Base Collective's sole recording as a large ensemble Anatomy of a Groove (1992). At the same time, Wilson toured with avant-garde trio New Air featuring alto saxophonist Henry Threadgill and recorded Air Show No. 1 (1987) in Italy. A decade her senior and an AACM member, Threadgill has been lauded as a composer for his ability to transcend stylistic boundaries, a trait he and Wilson share. ==Solo career== Like fellow M-Base artists, Wilson signed to the Munich-based, independent label JMT. She released her first recording as a leader Point of View in 1986. Like the majority of her JMT albums that followed, originals by Wilson in keeping with M-Base dominated these sessions; she would also record material by and co-written with Coleman, Jean-Paul Bourelly, and James Weidman as well as a few standards. Her throaty contralto gradually emerges over the course of these recordings, making its way to the foreground. She developed a remarkable ability to stretch and bend pitches, elongate syllables, manipulate tone and timbre from dusky to hollow.Brian Priestley, Digby Fairweather, Ian Carr. Jazz, The Rough Guide, 2nd Edition March 2000 While these recordings established her as a serious musician, Wilson received her first broad critical acclaim for the album of standards recorded in the middle of this period, Blue Skies (1988). Her signing with Blue Note Records in 1993 marked a crucial turning point in her career and major breakthrough to audiences beyond jazz with albums selling in the hundreds of thousands of copies. Beginning with Blue Light 'Til Dawn (1993) her repertoire moved towards a broad synthesis of blues, pop, jazz, world music, and country. Although she continued to perform originals and standards, she adopted songs as diverse as Robert Johnson's \\"Come On in My Kitchen\\", Joni Mitchell's \\"Black Crow\\", The Monkees' \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\", and Hank Williams' \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". Wilson's 1996 album New Moon Daughter won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance. In 1997, she recorded and toured as a featured vocalist with Wynton Marsalis' Pulitzer Prize winning composition, Blood on the Fields. Miles Davis was one of Wilson's greatest influences. In 1989, Wilson performed as the opening act for Davis at the JVC Jazz Festival in Chicago. In 1999 she produced Traveling Miles as a tribute to Davis. The album developed from a series of jazz concerts that she performed at Lincoln Center in November 1997 in Davis' honor, and includes three selections based on Davis' own compositions, from which Wilson adapted the original themes. ==Personal life== Wilson was married to Anthony Wilson from 1981 to 1983. She has a son, Jeris, born in the late 1980s. Her song \\"Out Loud (Jeris' Blues)\\" on the album She Who Weeps is dedicated to him. For many years she and her son lived in New York City's Sugar Hill, in an apartment that once belonged to Count Basie, Lena Horne and the boxer Joe Louis. From 2000 to 2003 Wilson was married to actor Isaach de Bankolé, who directed her in the concert film Traveling Miles: Cassandra Wilson (2000). Wilson and her mother are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. ==Awards and honors== * 1994–1996: Female Jazz Vocalist of the Year, Down Beat * 1997: Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, New Moon Daughter * 1999: Miles Davis Prize, Montreal International Jazz Festival * 2001: \\"America's Best Singer\\", Time * 2003: Honorary doctorate in the Arts, Millsaps College * 2009: Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, Loverly * 2010: Added to Mississippi Blues Trail * 2010: Best Vocal Album, NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll 2010, Silver Pony * 2011: Best Traditional Jazz Album, BET Soul Train Award, Silver Pony * 2015: Honorary doctorate in Fine Arts, The New School * 2015: Spirit of Ireland Award, Irish Arts Centre * 2020: Honorary doctorate in Music, Berklee College of Music ==DiscographyAs leader=== * Point of View (JMT, 1986) * Days Aweigh (JMT, 1987) * Blue Skies (JMT, 1988) * Jumpworld (JMT, 1990) * Live (JMT, 1991) * She Who Weeps (JMT, 1991) * Dance to the Drums Again (DIW, 1992) * After the Beginning Again (JMT, 1992) * Blue Light 'til Dawn (Blue Note, 1993) * New Moon Daughter (Blue Note, 1995) * Rendezvous with Jacky Terrasson (Blue Note, 1997) * Traveling Miles (Blue Note, 1999) * Belly of the Sun (Blue Note, 2002) * Glamoured (Blue Note, 2003) * Thunderbird (Blue Note, 2006) * Loverly (Blue Note, 2008) * Silver Pony (Blue Note, 2010) * Another Country (eOne, 2012)) * Coming Forth by Day (Legacy, 2015) Compilations * Songbook (JMT, 1995) * Sings Standards (Verve, 2002) * Love Phases Dimensions: From the JMT Years (Edel, 2004) * Closer to You: The Pop Side (Blue Note, 2009) * 5 Original Albums (Blue Note, 2018) ===As guest=== With Steve Coleman * Motherland Pulse (JMT, 1985) * On the Edge of Tomorrow (JMT, 1986) * World Expansion (JMT, 1987) * Sine Die (Pangaea, 1988) * Rhythm People (RCA, 1990) * Black Science (Novus, 1991) * Drop Kick (Novus, 1992) * The Ascension to Light (BMG France, 1999) With Wynton Marsalis * Blood on the Fields (Columbia, 1997) * Reeltime (Sony, 1999) With The Roots * Do You Want More?!!!??!

The leaves are alternate, entire, with three prominent basal veins, and long; some species are deciduous, others evergreen. The flowers are small, inconspicuous yellow-green. The fruit is an edible drupe, yellow-brown, red, or black, globose or oblong, long, often very sweet and sugary, reminiscent of a date in texture and flavour. ==Etymology== The generic name is derived via classical Latin from Hellenistic Greek, where it is presumed to have been borrowed from another language, perhaps from zizfum or zizafun, the Persian word for Z. lotus.. ==Ecology== Ziziphus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix zizyphella, which feeds exclusively on the genus, and Endoclita malabaricus. Well known species includes Ziziphus jujuba (jujube), Ziziphus spina-christi from southwestern Asia, Ziziphus lotus from the Mediterranean region, and ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), which is found from western Africa to India. Ziziphus joazeiro grows in the Caatinga of Brazil. Ziziphus celata is listed as an endangered species in the United States. The fruits are an important source for birds, which eat the whole fruit and regurgitate the seeds intact, expanding the seeds in the best conditions for germination (ornithochory). Secondly, seed dispersal is carried out by mammals or fishes. The fruit is energy-rich because of the large amount of sugar it contains. It is cultivated and eaten fresh, dry, and in jam. It is also added as a base in meals and in the manufacture of candy. The leaves can be either deciduous or evergreen depending on species, and are aromatic. They are temperate or tropical plants, having a great range. They are most abundant where annual average temperatures are between and and minimum winter temperatures are not lower than . They prefer locations with a high temperature coupled with humidity. They require a deep soil, fresh, soft, siliceous-calcareous nature or limestone-clay-silica- clay and subsurface permeable, with pH between 5.5 and 7.8. In excessively sandy or clay soils which may be affected by standing water, the plants do not grow well. Many species are very sensitive to drought, and if the land is excessively dry and of calcareous nature, they may resent the lack of moisture. At the slightest drought, premature fruit drop is frequent. Ziziphus has several relict species living in temperate areas. These species can not endure the harsh winters of temperate continental climates. The ecological requirements of the genus are mostly those of vigorous species with a great ability to propagate in conducive habitats. This genus is adapted mostly to high rainfall and humidity, but some species are deciduous, living in Mediterranean humid climate. The deciduous Ziziphus species lose all of their leaves for part of the year depending on variations in rainfall. In deciduous species in tropical, subtropical, and arid regions, leaf loss coincides with the dry season. They grow mostly in tropical forests but have also been found in stubbles, pastures, coastal ranges, tropical mountain areas, and wet to dry interior regions. The family is distributed throughout tropical and subtropical areas and in cloud forest. The differences are ecological adaptations to different environments over a relatively dry-wet climate. Species in less humid environment are smaller or less robust, with less abundant and thinner foliage and have oleifera cells that produce trees with a more fragrant aroma. ==Uses== In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), suan zao ren (Ziziphus spinosa) is considered to be sweet and sour in taste, and neutral in action. It is believed to nourish the heart yin, augment the liver blood, and calm the spirit (TCM medical terms). It is used to treat irritability, insomnia and heart palpitations. ==Mythology== The mythological lotus tree which occurs in Homer's Odyssey is often equated with Z. lotus, though the date palm is also a possible candidate. == Selected species == * Ziziphus abyssinica Hochst. ex A.Rich.

His investments in silver mines in Nevada made him a millionaire, and he was one of the famous \\"silver kings\\" who became wealthy on the Comstock Lode. Fair later became a real estate investor and railroad builder in California. In 1881, he was elected a United States Senator from Nevada. ==Early life== Born to a poor Irish family in Clogher, County Tyrone, James Fair came with his father to the United States in 1843 and grew up on a farm in Illinois. There he received an extensive education in business before moving to California in 1850, where he prospected the Feather River country for gold embedded in quartz rather than pan for placer gold. His attention shifted to Nevada, where he operated a stamp mill on the Carson River and landed various mine superintendent positions around the Comstock Lode region. He became superintendent of the Hale and Norcross Mine in Virginia City, Nevada in 1867. He formed a partnership with three fellow Irishmen: John William Mackay and the San Francisco saloon owners James C. Flood and William S. O'Brien. The company was formally Flood and O'Brien, but popularly known as the \\"Bonanza Firm\\". The four made large fortunes in shares in silver mines on the Comstock Lode, the first major silver district discovered in the United States. In twenty years time the Comstock Lode produced over one hundred million dollars. The partners controlled and operated various mines on the Comstock, but their greatest success came in 1873 when miners in their Consolidated Virginia mine found the large ore body that became known as \\"the big bonanza.\\" Fair invested his portion in railroads and real estate, bringing his private fortune up to $50 million.Gavan, Terrence (1998). The Barons of Newport: A Guide to the Gilded Age. Newport: Pineapple Publications, p. 38. Although Fair was acknowledged to be a capable mine superintendent and a shrewd businessman, he was not well liked, and carried the nickname \\"Slippery Jim.\\"Smith, Grant H. (1943). The History of the Comstock Lode, Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, Geology and Mining Series No. 37, p. 118. He invested much of his income from the Comstock in railroads and San Francisco real estate. Fair and Mackay owned the Nevada Bank of San Francisco, a rival to William Chapman Ralston's Bank of California; after the collapse of Ralston's financial empire, the Nevada Bank was for a time the largest bank in America at the height of the silver boom. ==South Pacific Coast Railroad== In 1876, in partnership with several others, Fair established the narrow-gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad. From its beginning near present-day Newark, the line extended down the east side of San Francisco Bay, through San Jose and Los Gatos and southward over the Santa Cruz Mountains over a route that entailed a 6,200-foot tunnel, another 5,000-foot tunnel and six shorter ones. Some six hundred Chinese workers were employed in clearing, grading, laying track and tunneling. In that last activity, thirty-one workers lost their lives, primarily from explosions of underground natural gas. At its southern end, the railroad acquired the Santa Cruz & Felton Railroad in Felton. The line over the mountains was completed in May 1880. The South Pacific Coast Railroad was immediately successful and soon profitable. In 1886, Southern Pacific purchased SPC for six million dollars. Sothern Pacific later converted it to standard gauge and operated it until 1940, when the over-the-mountains portion of the line was abandoned.Hamman, Rick. 1980. California Central Coast Railways. Boulder, Colo: Pruett Pub. Co. ==Political career== Fair was elected by the Nevada legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1881. He was not much interested in Washington, where he promoted silver issues in the Senate at a time when a movement was afoot to demonetize silver. Fair served one term after which he moved back to San Francisco in 1887. ==Personal life== Fair's mausoleum at Holy Cross In 1861, Fair married Theresa Rooney, who had been keeping a boarding house. She divorced him in 1883 on grounds of \\"habitual adultery\\" and brought up their four children on her own, with a very considerable settlement. In 1890, his eldest daughter \\"Tessie\\" was married to Hermann Oelrichs of Norddeutsche Lloyd shipping lines in the grandest wedding that San Francisco had seen. Fair remained in his hotel suiteHis hotel built that year survived the San Francisco earthquake and continues as the \\"Queen Anne Hotel\\". without an invitation. He gave Tessie a million dollars as a wedding gift nonetheless.Ferguson, J. Walton (1977). Rosecliff. Newport: The Preservation Society of Newport County, p. 2. Fair is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. His will left $40 million in trust to his two daughters, Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs (née Theresa \\"Tessie\\" Alice Fair) and Virginia Graham Fair (who later married William Kissam Vanderbilt II), and his surviving son, Charles Lewis Fair, who died in a car accident in France on August 14, 1902, at age 35, having been disinherited by his father.Lewisiana or the Lewis Letter, in archive.org. After Fair's death, Mrs. Nettie Cravens came forward claiming to be his wife. She presented her evidence to a court at trial, but lost the case. She moved to Iowa and lived in obscurity, spending her last days in a mental institution. Later, women's rights advocate Phoebe Couzins also claimed a relationship with Fair. ==Legacy== The Fairmont San Francisco hotel was built as a grand monument to Fair by his daughters Theresa Fair Oelrichs and Virginia Fair Vanderbilt, who named it in honor of their father. Construction began in 1902, but they sold their interests in 1906, days before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Fair is remembered in Santa Cruz, California in the naming of Fair Avenue, and in San Francisco with Fair Avenue in Bernal Heights. ==See also== *List of United States Senators born outside the United States ==References== ==Further reading== *Tales of Love and Hate in Old San Francisco, Millie Robbins.

Released in 1992, it is the first video game in the Kirby series and the debut of Kirby. As the inaugural Kirby title it created many conventions that would appear in later games in the series. Kirby's Dream Land was designed by Masahiro Sakurai, who intended it to be a simple game that could be easy to pick up and play by those unfamiliar with action games. For more advanced players, he offered additional optional challenges such as an unlockable hard mode and the ability to edit Kirby's maximum HP and starting number of lives. Kirby's Dream Land was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console in 2011 and is also one of the games included in the compilation game Kirby's Dream Collection for the Wii, released to celebrate Kirby's 20th anniversary. ==Gameplay== Kirby battling Whispy Woods, the boss of the first stage Green Greens. Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like many other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side- scrolling, played on a two-dimensional plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight. The game consists of a total of five levels. Levels are made up of a series of large \\"rooms\\" connected by doors that lead Kirby to different areas, rather than the single continuous corridors typical of platformers at the time. Some of these doors lead to hidden areas or alternate pathways through the level. The doors act as checkpoints returning the player to the beginning of a \\"room\\" should they die rather than starting the level over. The goal of the game is to clear the level by defeating the boss at the end. If Kirby touches an enemy or an dangerous object, he loses one or more of his health, depending on the enemy or obstacle he touched. If all of his health is lost, or he falls into a bottomless pit, the player loses a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Kirby can recover lost health by eating food, found across the stage. Unlike the copy abilities of later titles, Kirby's Dream Land has more traditional power-ups that offer Kirby temporary abilities when he picks them up. These often appear in the form of food, such as Spicy Curry that gives Kirby fire breath or a Mint Leaf (Sweet Potato in the Japanese version) that lets Kirby fire air puffs rapidly without losing flight. At the end of each level is a boss Kirby must fight to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up small objects or projectiles created by the boss' attacks and spitting them back at the boss. The third boss, Kaboola, is fought using an unlimited version of the Mint Leaf item, incorporating shoot 'em up elements. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where Kirby must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on that boss's home level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points by defeating enemies and collecting items, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby's Dream Land lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a game over, or if the player resets the game. Once the game has been completed, a code is offered to play an optional extra game, in which the difficulty is significantly increased. Completing the extra game offered a second code that lets the player adjust lives and vitality settings to play an easier or even harder game, and listen to music and sound effects freely. ==Plot== One night, under the cover of darkness, the gluttonous King Dedede and his minions steal all the food in Dream Land as well as the Sparkling Stars used to obtain more food. The next morning as the residents are discussing what to do, a spry little boy named Kirby, steps forward and volunteers to retrieve the food and stars, and stop Dedede. ==Development== An early magazine scan, referring to Kirby as Popopo. The article title reads: Kirby's Dream Land was developed by Masahiro Sakurai of HAL Laboratory. Kirby initially was a dummy character that the developers used until they could define a more sophisticated image. However the designers grew to like Kirby so much that they decided to keep him instead of using a more advanced character. At the time he was to be named , and Kirby's Dream Land was titled . Eventually, he was renamed Kirby and the game was renamed Hoshi no Kirby; Kirby of the Stars, also the name of the Japanese version of the Kirby anime. During the development of what was referred to as Twinkle Popopo, Popopo/Kirby's color had not been decided upon. Sakurai wanted him to be pink, while Shigeru Miyamoto felt that he should be yellow. Eventually, Nintendo decided to make him pink. Although pink is still Kirby's main color, later games have used a yellow Kirby to represent the second player in multiplayer. When Kirby of the Stars was released in Japan, it featured Kirby as being pink. However, Nintendo of America designed the North American box art and advertisements with a white Kirby based on the game's grey-scale visuals. The music was composed by Jun Ishikawa. He has been a regular composer in the Kirby series. His most recent work was on Kirby: Star Allies in 2018. Certain songs were also reused in the Super Smash Bros. series as the background music of the Dream Land stage in Super Smash Bros. and the Green Greens stage in Super Smash Bros. Melee. ==Reception== Kirby's Dream Land has received generally positive reception. It holds an aggregate score of 62.22% on GameRankings with nine reviews, making it the 17th best Game Boy game. By May 28, 1994 Kirby's Dream Land sold 1.3 million copies. To date, it has sold in excess of 5 million copies worldwide; Gamasutra cited its new style of gameplay for its success. At the time, it was HAL Laboratory's most successful game. Gamasutra's Osamu Inoue attributed the game's success to Satoru Iwata, formerly an employee of HAL Laboratory, who Inoue comments has a \\"simple-minded passion for creating games\\". Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 14th best Game Boy game and felt that it was a relaxing game. Author Wendy Despain used Kirby's Dream Lands plot as an example of how early platform games' plots progressed, which she collectively described as \\"the main character needing to reach a villain to put right a wrong.\\" Humongous Life's Jonathan Wahlgren called it a strong game, but felt it to be \\"too elementary\\". GamesRadar's Brett Elston did an article on its music, specifically giving praise to the final boss music, stating that it is the \\"only song in the original Kirby that had a sense of challenge or conflict instead of skipping through a field of floating cakes.\\" Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com praised it for its unique platforming mechanics, describing it as the start of a \\"gluttonous legend\\". Allgame's Joshua Crystal called it a \\"great game for beginner players and ones that enjoy a fun, but short, experience.\\" In an article detailing various Kirby series video games, IGN stated that it was a decent platformer, but very basic compared to later titles. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas and Craig Harris included Kirby's Dream Land in their wishlist for a hypothetical \\"Virtual Console\\" for the Nintendo 3DS, commenting that its inclusion would be based on nostalgia rather than it feeling \\"new and sensational\\". They also added that original characters like Kirby were the stars of the Game Boy rather than established characters such as Link, Mario, Samus Aran, and Pit. They would again praise Kirby's Dream Land for being an original game in their \\"History of the Game Boy\\" article, adding that while \\"attitude\\" was common in new platforming mascots, Kirby was cheery and adorable, while the game featured \\"breezy, casual gameplay and lighthearted atmosphere\\". GameSpy's Gerald Villoria, Brian Altano, and Ryan Scott called it \\"basic\\" compared to later titles in the series, adding that it lacked a sense of danger because Kirby could fly. Nintendo Power editors George and Bob shared roughly similar opinions of the game; George stated that it is a really fun game, owing its quality to its excellent play control and well thought out concept, while Bob stated that it is deceptively simple looking, when it in fact features a decent challenge for more experienced gamers. GamesRadar listed Kirby's Dream Land and its sequel as two of the titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console. ==Sequels== Kirby's Dream Land has spawned numerous of sequels across several video game consoles. The first direct sequel, Kirby's Adventure, released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become a staple of the series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby Air Ride, pinball game Kirby's Pinball Land, and an action-golf hybrid game Kirby's Dream Course. Kirby's Dream Land would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1994 Kirby's Dream Land 2, which incorporated the copy mechanic from Kirby's Adventure. The Super NES game Kirby Super Star contains a shortened remake of Kirby's Dream Land, titled \\"Spring Breeze\\". It features Kirby's copy ability from later titles and the ability to summon helpers for co-op, but is missing the Castle Lololo stage and Kaboola boss fight, Lololo and Lalala becoming the boss for Float Island instead. Kirby Super Star Ultra expanded upon this with \\"Revenge of The King\\", a harder version of \\"Spring Breeze\\" that takes heavy inspiration from Kirby's Dream Lands extra mode and features longer levels more in line with the original game. Although Castle Lololo is still absent, Kaboola's boss fight returns in a reimagined form. Kirby and King Dedede appear as playable characters in the fighting game series Super Smash Bros.. Both characters have alternate costumes that give them a monochrome appearance reminiscent of the Game Boy's graphics. The \\"Green Greens\\" stage, first appearing in Super Smash Bros Melee is based on this game's first level. The \\"Dream Land GB\\" stage, introduced in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, transitions between multiple locations from Kirby's Dream Land as displayed through a monochromatic Game Boy screen.https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/10/review-smash-bros-3ds-is-a- surprisingly-good-imitation-of-the-real-thing/ ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 video games Category:Game Boy games Category:Game Boy-only games Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Kirby (series) platform games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Nintendo games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Nintendo 3DS ","title":"Kirby's Dream Land"},{"id":"516035","text":"This is a partial list of entertainment venues in London, England. ==Theatres== The majority of London's commercial \\"theatre land\\" is situated around Shaftesbury Avenue, the Strand and nearby streets in the West End.

The office in its current form was established under the Constitution of 2019. The president is the second most powerful position, after the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba. Miguel Díaz-Canel became president of the Council of State on 19 April 2018, taking over from Raúl Castro, and has been president of Cuba since 10 October 2019. The position of first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba continues to be the most powerful political position in Cuba. Fidel Castro held both positions from 1976 to 2008, and Raúl Castro held both positions from 2011 to 2018. Raúl Castro continues to hold the position of first secretary. ==History== Under the 1901 constitution, Cuba had a presidential system based on that of the United States. In 1940, a new constitution reformed the government into a semi-presidential system, 18 years before its modern archetype – the French Fifth Republic – came into being. On 2 December 1976, the executive was reformed again by a new national constitution, this time in emulation of the Soviet Union. The presidential office was abolished and replaced by a collective head of state, the Council of State, elected by the National Assembly of People's Power. However, unlike the USSR's arrangements, where the chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers were distinct posts, the chairman of the Council of State also chaired the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, unlike English and Russian, Spanish does not distinguish between the terms \\"chairman/председатель\\" and \\"president/президент\\", translating both as \\"presidente\\". Thus, when back- translated into English, the term used was not \\"Chairman\\" (on the precedent of similar institutions in countries whose languages have a chairman/president distinction, such as the USSR and East Germany), but rather \\"President\\", from the shared etymology with the Spanish \\"presidente\\". On 24 February 2019, another constitution – Cuba's current – was adopted in a referendum. Under it, the government was again re-organized, and the posts of President and Prime Minister were restored. This reorganization took effect on 11 October 2019. Díaz-Canel was President of the Council of State until 10 October 2019 and President of the Republic after that date. Under the new constitution, the position of President of the Council of State continues as a separate role, subordinate to President of the Republic. The new document also limited the president to two consecutive five-year terms. In cases of the absence, illness or death of the President of Cuba, the vice president assumes the presidential duties. ==Powers== The president of Cuba is mandated to have the following powers as per the Constiution as amended: # Propose to the National Assembly of People’s Power, once elected by that body, the Prime Minister of Cuba and the members of the Council of Ministers # Accept (based on personal preference) the resignation of the Prime Minister and members of the Council of Ministers or propose either to the National Assembly of People’s Power or the Council of State the replacement of any of those members and, in both cases, to propose the corresponding substitutes # Receive the credentials of the heads of delegation of foreign diplomatic missions. This responsibility may be delegated to any of the vice presidents of the Council of State; # Assume the supreme command of all armed forces and determine their general organization # Preside over the National Defense Council # Declare a state emergency in those cases provided for in this Constitution, stating his decision, as soon as the circumstances permit it, to the National Assembly of People’s Power or to the Council of State if the Assembly is unable to meet, according to legal effects # Sign decree-laws and other resolutions of the Council of State and the legal provisions adopted by the Council of Ministers or its executive committee, and arrange for their publication in the Official Gazette of the Republic # Assume all other duties assigned by the Constitution or by the laws of the Republic to him or her ==List of heads of state== ==See also== *First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba *Prime Minister of Cuba **List of prime ministers of Cuba *Cuba under Fidel Castro *2006–08 Cuban transfer of presidential duties ==References== * Category:Government of Cuba Category:Politics of Cuba Category:1902 establishments in Cuba ","title":"President of Cuba"},{"id":"516045","text":"Blue River may refer to: ==RiversCanada=== *Blue River (North Thompson River tributary), British Columbia *Blue River (Dease River tributary), British Columbia ===China=== *Yangtze River, sometimes referred to as the Blue River in older English sources ===New Zealand=== *Blue River (New Zealand), South Island ===United States=== *Blue River (Arizona), a tributary of the San Francisco River *Blue River (Colorado), a tributary of the Colorado River *Blue River (Indiana), a tributary of the Ohio River *Blue River (Missouri River tributary), in Missouri *Blue River (Oklahoma), a tributary of the Red River *Blue River (Oregon), a tributary of the McKenzie River *Blue River (Wisconsin), a river of Wisconsin, a tributary of the Wisconsin River ==CommunitiesCanada=== *Blue River, British Columbia, an unincorporated settlement **Blue River station, a Canadian National Railway station *Blue River Indian Reserve No. 1, in British Columbia ===United States=== *Blue River, Colorado *Blue River, Indiana *Blue River, Kentucky *Blue River, Oregon *Blue River, Wisconsin ==Other uses== *Blue River (film), a 1995 television film *Blue River (album), by Eric Andersen, 1972 *\\"Blue River\\" (song), by Elvis Presley, 1965 *Blue River, a 1992 novel by Ethan Canin, basis for the film *\\"Blue River\\", a 1920s piano roll cut by Dagmar Nordstrom ==See also== * *Big Blue River (disambiguation) *Little Blue River (disambiguation) *Blue River Township (disambiguation) *Río Azul (Spanish for Blue River), a Mayan archaeological site ","title":"Blue River"},{"id":"516057","text":"The North Carolina General Assembly election, 2002 was the first General Assembly election conducted using districts drawn following the 2000 Census.

Previously, some districts elected 2 or 3 members; the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that this was not allowed under the North Carolina Constitution of 1971. These elections resulted in Democratic control of the North Carolina Senate with a 28-22 majority. The House of Representatives was won by the Republicans by a wafer-thin 61-59 majority.

Executive power in Haiti is divided between the president and the government headed by the Prime Minister of Haiti. The current president is Jovenel Moïse, who took office on February 7, 2017. ==Term and election== The qualifications for the presidency are specified by Chapter III Section A (Articles 134 and 135) of the 1987 Constitution of Haiti. The president is elected to a five-year term by popular vote. The president is not to be elected twice in a row: he may serve a second term only after an interval of five years, and must not run for a third term. To be elected president, a candidate must: # be a native-born Haitian and never renounced that nationality; # have reached the age of 35 by election day; # enjoy civil and political rights and not have been sentenced to death, or penal servitude or the loss of civil rights for a crime of ordinary law; # be the owner of a real property and have one's habitual residence in the country; # reside in the country at least 5 years before election day; # have been discharged of responsibilities if previously handling public funds. Elections are held on the last Sunday in November in the fifth year of the current president's term. However, the election time is not fixed according to the election held in 2015. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff election is held between the top two candidates. Runoff candidate who have not withdrawn before the runoff, who have the highest number of votes will become the next president. Each presidential term in office begins and ends on the first February 7 after presidential elections are held. However this is also altered after Michel Martelly became the president on May 11 of 2011. ==Duties and powers== The qualifications for the presidency are specified by Articles 136 to 147, part of Chapter III Section B of the 1987 Constitution of Haiti. The president has no powers except those accorded to him in the Constitution. The Constitution mandates that the president see to: the respect for and enforcement of the Constitution and the stability of the institutions; regular operations of the public authorities; the continuity of the State; and the nation's independence and the integrity of its territory. When there is a majority in Parliament, the president must choose a prime minister from the majority party; otherwise, he chooses one after consultation with the two houses of Parliament. In either case, the choice must then be ratified by Parliament. The president terminates the duties of the prime minister when the Government resigns. The president declares war and negotiates and signs peace treaties with the approval of the National Assembly, and signs all international treaties, conventions and agreements, submitting them to the National Assembly for ratification. The president accredits ambassadors and special envoys to foreign powers; receives letters of accreditation from ambassadors of foreign powers; and issue exequaturs to recognize consuls. With the approval of the senate, the president appoints the commander-in-chief of Haitian armed forces, Haitian police forces, ambassadors and consuls to foreign states. With the approval of the Council of Ministers, the president of the Republic appoints the directors general of the civil service, and delegates and vice delegates of Departments and Arrondissements. The president is also the head of Haitian armed forces. The president ratifies laws and has the right to choose between ratifying a law or not. The president could perform or commune sentences in all res judica cases, except ones carried by Supreme Court judges. The president, however, cannot grant amnesty to non- political prisoners. ==Residence== The National Palace in the capital Port-au- Prince served as the official residence of the president of Haiti, but it was severely damaged in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and demolished in 2012. ==List of presidents== ==Latest election== ==See also== *List of heads of state of Haiti *Prime Minister of Haiti ==Notes== [A___] citations are Article numbers of the 1987 Constitution of the Republic of Haiti.

It is the earliest extended song cycle to be widely performed. One of Schubert's most important works, it is the first of his two seminal cycles (the other being his later Winterreise), and a pinnacle of Lied. It is widely performed and recorded. Die schöne Müllerin is performed by a pianist and a solo singer. The vocal part falls in the range of a tenor or soprano voice, but is often sung by other voices, transposed to a lower range, a precedent established by Schubert himself. Since the story of the cycle is about a young man, the work is most often sung by men. The piano part bears much of the expressive burden of the work, and is only seldom a mere 'accompaniment' to the singer. A typical performance lasts around sixty to seventy minutes. ==Composition== Müller's poems were published in 1820, and Schubert set most of them to music between May and September 1823, while he was also writing his opera Fierrabras. He was 26 years old at the time. Schubert omitted five of the poems, such as a prologue and an epilogue delivered by the poet. The work was published in 1824 by the firm of Sauer and Leidesdorf as Op. 25 under the title Die schöne Müllerin, ein Zyklus von Liedern, gedichtet von Wilhelm Müller, which means, \\"The Lovely Maid of the Mill, a song cycle to poems by Wilhelm Müller\\", and was dedicated to . ==Narrative== Portrait of Schubert by Franz Eybl (1827) There are twenty songs in the cycle, around half in simple strophic form, and they move from cheerful optimism to despair and tragedy. At the beginning of the cycle, a young journeyman miller wanders happily through the countryside. He comes upon a brook, which he follows to a mill. He falls in love with the miller's beautiful daughter (the \\"Müllerin\\" of the title). She is out of his reach as he is only a journeyman. He tries to impress her, but her response seems tentative. The young man is soon supplanted in her affections by a hunter clad in green, the color of a ribbon he gave the girl. In his anguish, he experiences an obsession with the color green, then an extravagant death fantasy in which flowers sprout from his grave to express his undying love. (See Beethoven's \\"Adelaide\\" for a similar fantasy.) In the end, the young man despairs and presumably drowns himself in the brook. The last number is a lullaby sung by the brook. ==Editions== The Diabelli edition of 1830 in a facsimile score, with notes by Walther Dürr, was published (1996) by Bärenreiter. The version in most common use is the Peters Edition, edited by Max Friedlaender, and in this and several other editions (e.g. Schirmer) the cycle is presented as the first 20 songs of Volume 1. There are versions in the original (high) keys, and transposed alternatives for lower voices. The Peters edition was revised by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elmar Budde, and is available as Volume 1 of the Peters Urtext Edition, available in high, medium and low key versions. The most recent scholarly edition is in the New Schubert Edition, again edited by Walther Dürr and published by Bärenreiter, and contains transposed versions for lower voices. Six of the songs were transcribed for solo piano by Franz Liszt and published as Müllerlieder.Publisher's note pp. ix–x in Franz Liszt: The Schubert Song Transcriptions for Solo Piano: Series II: The Complete Winterreise and Seven other Great Songs, 1996, Mineola, N.Y., Dover Publications ==Synopsis== #\\"Das Wandern\\" (\\"Wandering\\"; B major): \\"Wandering is the miller's joy\\" – a journeyman Miller happily travels through the countryside, singing of the restless water, millstones, and millwheels of his trade. This is a classic example of strophic song, in which the accompaniment is traditionally made to imitate the various objects about which the Miller sings. Schubert facilitates this with characteristically elegant and inventive piano writing; despite its simplicity, the music contains elements readily receptive to this imitative treatment, with the flowing cyclical broken triads evocative of both wheels and water, and the bass octaves pounding away. The composer continues this illustrative style throughout the cycle, with various recurring motifs. By far the most important of these, the Brook, is a character of its own represented by the piano, and appears next. #\\"Wohin?\\" (\\"Where to?\\"; G major): \\"Is this my path then? Oh tell me, brook, where to?\\" – the Miller fatefully comes across a Brook, and is captivated into following it. Through-composed, the piano imitates the babbling brook with a rippling pattern. This figuration, a first- inversion broken triad circling back on itself, goes on to represent the Brook almost exclusively throughout the cycle. #\\"Halt!\\" (\\"Stop!\\"; C major): \\"Dear little Brook, is this what you meant?\\" – the Brook leads the Miller to an idyllic mill in a forest grove. Through-composed, the piano imitates the vigorous turning of the mill wheel. Subtle diminished and minor harmonies in the accompaniment hint at foreboding. #\\"Danksagung an den Bach\\" (\\"Thanksgiving to the Brook\\"; G major): \\"Did she send you? Or have you enchanted me?\\" – The grateful Miller thanks the Brook for providing work for his hands and his heart – the latter in the form of the beautiful maid of the mill, the Müllerin of the title. Through-composed, with a contemplative broken chord pattern in the accompaniment, and a section in parallel minor as the Miller questions the nature of the Brook's guidance. #\\"Am Feierabend\\" (\\"Evening's Rest\\"; A minor): \\"If only I could move the millstones alone! Then the beautiful maiden would know my true purpose!\\" – the Miller is troubled when the Maiden wishes a good night to all the men, paying him no particular attention; he aches to distinguish himself from his peers. The piano channels the millworks in this through-composed song, with the up-and-down arpeggio from Halt! again representing the wheel and pounding bass evoking the stones. Highly contrasting static music in the central section captures the restful after- work setting of the otherwise incongruous title. This is an energetic high point of the first section, and the one entry in the cycle in which the protagonist actually sings the phrase \\"die schöne Mullerin\\". #\\"Der Neugierige\\" (\\"The Inquirer\\"; B major): \\"Tell me, little Brook – does she love me?\\" – he asks the enigmatic brook whether the Maiden loves him – Yes or No – between these two words lies his entire world. An expressive through-composed song opening with a cleverly executed musical question in the accompaniment – a rising pattern ending on a diminished chord. A slow, contemplative second section follows as the Miller interrogates the Brook, represented as always by its flowing broken triads. #\\"Ungeduld\\" (\\"Impatience\\"; A major): \\"My heart is yours, and it will be forever!\\" – he wishes he could carve his love into every tree, have every bird sing of it, have the wind tell of it. A strophic song in which a busy, restless repeated chord pattern in the accompaniment, crowded with ornaments, reflects the Miller's agitated state. #\\"Morgengruß\\" (\\"Morning Greeting\\"; C major): \\"Does my greeting displease you so?\\" – the Miller is troubled by the Maiden's cool reaction to his morning greeting. Nonetheless, his optimism is intact – he will just wait outside her window. A ballad in strophic form that progressively gathers expressive energy as the metric subdivision increases over each stanza, the Miller's infatuation swelling. #\\"Des Müllers Blumen\\" (\\"The Miller's Flowers\\"; A major): \\"The flowers will whisper to her as in a dream: forget me not!\\" – the Miller indulges in a poetic metaphor between the blue flowers beside the brook and the Maiden's blue eyes. The Miller's outpouring is matched with a lyrical arpeggio pattern and gently rocking 6/8 rhythm in this strophic song. An accepted performance convention places the third strophe, concerning dreams, an octave higher in the accompaniment. There is no explicitly indicated outro music, which is unusual in Schubert, but accompanists often choose to simply repeat the introduction. Regardless of this choice, the ending segues into the next song, in the same key. #\\"Tränenregen\\" (\\"Rain of Tears\\"; A major): \\"She said: 'A rain is coming – farewell, I'm going home'\\" – the Miller and Maiden share a tender moment by the Brook – the three principal characters in one place. The Miller cannot bring himself to look at her, and stares into the Brook at the moon and her reflection. As his tears ripple in the water, she abruptly leaves. Augmented harmonies and lyrical, flowing counterpoint in the accompaniment again imitate the brook and add to the nocturne atmosphere. The form is primarily strophic, with a shadowy coda in the parallel minor as the Maiden takes her leave. #\\"Mein!\\" (\\"Mine!\\"; D major): \\"Are these all the flowers you have, spring? Can you not shine brighter, sun? The beloved Millermaid is mine! Mine!\\" – the ecstatic Miller is convinced he possesses the Maiden, despite heretofore dubious encouragement. A brash, heavy-handed, low register accompaniment in broken chords captures the Miller's manic and effusive machismo, and the vocal line features athletic melisma in nearly every bar. In a near-comical fortissimo flourish, a deliberately muddy fully voiced D major chord closes the first half of the work. #\\"Pause\\" (\\"Interlude\\"; B major): \\"Is it the echo of my love's pain? Or the prelude to new songs?\\" – the Miller, his heart too full to sing, hangs his lute on the wall with a green ribbon and reflects on the heavy burden of happiness. He muses anxiously whether the stirrings of his lute are ominous. Through-composed, a repetitive lute-like motif and static harmony in the accompaniment create the interlude atmosphere. Dissonant minor harmonies reflect the Miller's misgivings before they are shrugged off in the outro. #\\"Mit dem grünen Lautenbande\\" (\\"With the Green Lute-Ribbon\\"; B major): \\"Wind the green ribbon into your locks, since you like green so much!\\" – the Maiden mentions she likes green, and the Miller is happy to oblige, giving her the ribbon as a symbol of their evergreen love. He tries to convince himself that he too likes green, though he is white with flour. Strophic, in short verses with flourishes idiomatic of the lute, the saccharine melody and accompaniment reflect the Miller's deluded optimism. #\\"Der Jäger\\" (\\"The Hunter\\"; C minor): \\"There is no game here for you to hunt! Only a doe, a tame one, for me!\\" – a rough and dashing Hunter clad in green arrives at the mill; the Miller is immediately disturbed by this romantic rival and spirals into a jealous diatribe. The vocal line is extremely dense and the delivery deliberately rushed in the manner of a patter song. In strophic form, the piano imitates hunting horns with a standard idiomatic chord pattern (see Der Lindenbaum from Winterreise, etc.) in a brash staccato 6/8 rhythm. The key changes rapidly between C minor and its relative major E major. This song is a turning point, marking the beginning of the Miller's descent into tragedy. #\\"Eifersucht und Stolz\\" (\\"Jealousy and Pride\\"; G minor): \\"Where to so fast and wild, dear brook? Turn back, and scold your maiden!\\" – the Miller desperately compels the Brook to admonish the fickle Maiden, who has been flirting with the Hunter. Through-composed, the agitated broken-chord accompaniment imitates the now-raging Brook, with a central section again imitating hunting horns. #\\"Die liebe Farbe\\" (\\"The Beloved Colour\\"; B minor): \\"Dig me a grave in the green meadow, cover me with green turf, my sweetheart likes green so much\\" – the catatonic Miller obsesses miserably over green, the color of his love and his pain. An ostinato F in sixteenth notes, repeated over 500 times in the accompaniment across the strophic verses, reflects the Miller's tortured fixation and the monotony of the constant refrain. The sparse accompaniment follows the voice melody in lower harmony as it maintains the ostinato. Ironically, and most likely deliberately, the strophic verse structure and vocal line rhythm is identical to the cheerful Mit dem grünen Lautenbande; the lyrics for either song could be readily substituted over one another's accompaniment, despite their vast contrast in character and content. #\\"Die böse Farbe\\" (\\"The Hateful Colour\\"; B major): \\"Oh green, you hateful color you! So proud, so mocking, so pleased with my pain!\\" – the Miller bitterly and defiantly renounces the color green. He wishes only to take the Maiden's hand one last time to say farewell. In a through-composed rondo form, with an operatic scale of sound, the bold accompaniment again includes a hunting horn imitation in the second episode. In the parallel major of the preceding song, the two are an opposed pair. #\\"Trockne Blumen\\" (\\"Withered Flowers\\"; E minor): \\"And when she passes my grave, she will think 'He was true to me!'\\" – in an elaborate death fantasy, the Miller wishes to be buried with now-withered flowers the Maiden had given him. When she sees this, she will know his heart was faithful; the flowers will bloom again and thus his winter will have passed. Through-composed, the accompaniment at first represents the withered flowers with a minimalist series of simple chords – as the flowers bloom, the music becomes more lyrical, and the harmony and rhythm more intricate. #\\"Der Müller und der Bach\\" (\\"The Miller and the Brook\\"; G minor): \\"Oh dear little brook, you mean so well – but do you know what love does to you?\\" The hopeless Miller turns to the Brook in his heartbreak. The Brook answers with comforting and poetic words of love conquering pain. Resigned and exhausted, the Miller submits himself to the Brook's 'cool rest'. Through- composed, the gently rocking barcarolle-like accompaniment gives way to a broken chord pattern similar to that of Wohin, imitating the Brook and confirming a leitmotif of sorts as this character speaks for the first time. The notable use of Neapolitan chords in this song is one of many examples of chromatic substitution used liberally throughout the cycle, aptly illustrating in this case the languid resignation of the protagonist as the minor second sinks to the tonic. The outro sees the piano descend peacefully to a final major chord as the Miller meets his fate. #\\"Des Baches Wiegenlied\\" (\\"Of the Brook's Lullaby\\"; E major): – \\"Rest well, rest well, close your eyes. Wanderer, you weary one, you are at home.\\" the Brook, who has always shown the Miller the constancy he so desired, sings him to sleep, scolding the Maiden to not disturb him. A placid and relaxed strophic song, this idiomatic lullaby is by a considerable margin the longest entry in the cycle. The choice of E major, a tritone removed from the opening song, signifies the vast narrative distance covered by the cycle. \\"And heaven above, how vast it is!\\" ==ReferencesComprehensive research website, Iain C.

It produces a fixed (constant) voltage regardless of power supply variations, temperature changes and circuit loading from a device. It commonly has an output voltage around 1.25V (close to the theoretical band gap of silicon at 0K). This circuit concept was first published by David Hilbiber in 1964. Bob Widlar, Paul Brokaw and others followed up with other commercially successful versions. ==Operation== Circuit of a Brokaw bandgap reference Characteristic and balance point of T1 and T2 The voltage difference between two p–n junctions (e.g. diodes), operated at different current densities, is used to generate a current that is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) in a resistor. This current is used to generate a voltage in a second resistor. This voltage in turn is added to the voltage of one of the junctions (or a third one, in some implementations). The voltage across a diode operated at constant current is complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT), with a temperature coefficient of approximately −2mV/K. If the ratio between the first and second resistor is chosen properly, the first order effects of the temperature dependency of the diode and the PTAT current will cancel out. The resulting voltage is about 1.2–1.3V, depending on the particular technology and circuit design, and is close to the theoretical 1.22eV bandgap of silicon at 0K. The remaining voltage change over the operating temperature of typical integrated circuits is on the order of a few millivolts. This temperature dependency has a typical parabolic residual behavior since the linear (first order) effects are chosen to cancel. Because the output voltage is by definition fixed around 1.25V for typical bandgap reference circuits, the minimum operating voltage is about 1.4V, as in a CMOS circuit at least one drain-source voltage of a field-effect transistor (FET) has to be added. Therefore, recent work concentrates on finding alternative solutions, in which for example currents are summed instead of voltages, resulting in a lower theoretical limit for the operating voltage. The first letter of the acronym, CTAT, is sometimes misconstrued to represent constant rather than complementary. The term, constant with temperature (CWT), exists to address this confusion, but is not in widespread use. When summing a PTAT and a CTAT current, only the linear terms of current are compensated, while the higher-order terms are limiting the temperature drift (TD) of the bandgap reference at around 20ppm/°C, over a temperature range of 100°C. For this reason, in 2001, Malcovati designed a circuit topology that can compensate high-order non-linearities, thus achieving an improved TD. This design used an improved version of Banba topology and an analysis of base-emitter temperature effects that was performed by Tsividis in 1980.Y. P. Tsividis, “Accurate analysis of temperature effects in Ic-Vbe characteristics with application to bandgap reference sources,” IEEE J. Solid- State Circuits, vol. 15, no. 6, pp. 1076 – 1084, Dec. 1980. In 2012, Andreou has further improved the high-order non-linear compensation by using a second op. amp. along with an additional resistor leg at the point where the two currents are summed up. This method enhanced further the curvature correction and achieved superior TD performance over a wider temperature range. In addition it achieved improved line regulation and lower noise. The other critical issue in design of bandgap references is power efficiency and size of circuit. As a bandgap reference is generally based on BJT devices and resistors, the total size of circuit could be large and therefore expensive for IC design. Moreover, this type of circuit might consume a lot of power to reach to the desired noise and precision specification. Despite these limitations, the bandgap voltage reference is widely used in voltage regulators, covering the majority of 78xx, 79xx devices along with the LM317, LM337 and TL431 devices. Temperature coefficients as low as 1.5–2.0ppm/°C can be obtained with bandgap references. However, the parabolic characteristic of voltage versus temperature means that a single figure in ppm/°C does not adequately describe the behaviour of the circuit. Manufacturers' data sheets show that the temperature at which the peak (or trough) of the voltage curve occurs is subject to normal sample variations in production. Bandgaps are also suited for low-power applications. ==Patents== * 1966, US Patent 3271660, Reference voltage source, David Hilbiber.US Patent 3271660 - Reference voltage source, David F Hilbiber; United States Patent and Trademark Office; September 6, 1966. * 1971, US Patent 3617859, Electrical regulator apparatus including a zero temperature coefficient voltage reference circuit, Robert Dobkin and Robert Widlar.US Patent 3617859 - Electrical regulator apparatus including a zero temperature coefficient voltage reference circuit; Robert C Dobkin and Robert J Widlar; United States Patent and Trademark Office; November 2, 1971. * 1981, US Patent 4249122, Temperature compensated bandgap IC voltage references, Robert Widlar.US Patent 4249122 - Temperature compensated bandgap IC voltage references; Robert J Widlar; United States Patent and Trademark Office; February 3, 1981. * 1984, US Patent 4447784, Temperature compensated bandgap voltage reference circuit, Robert Dobkin.US Patent 4447784 - Temperature compensated bandgap voltage reference circuit; Robert C Dobkin; United States Patent and Trademark Office; May 8, 1984. ==Notes== ==See also== * Brokaw bandgap reference * LM317 * Silicon bandgap temperature sensor ==References== ==External links== * The Design of Band-Gap Reference Circuits: Trials and Tribulations p. 286 - Robert Pease, National Semiconductor * Features and Limitations of CMOS Voltage References * ECE 327: LM317 Bandgap Voltage Reference Example - Brief explanation of the temperature-independent bandgap reference circuit within the LM317.

Discretization error would occur even if it were possible to represent the values exactly and use exact arithmetic – it is the error from representing a function by its values at a discrete set of points, not an error in these values. ==References== ==See also== * Discretization * Linear multistep method * Quantization error Category:Numerical analysis ","title":"Discretization error"},{"id":"516072","text":"The Blue River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey.

It was the first game show to be broadcast regularly on television. It was an in-house production and broadcast in black and white. The host was Gil Fates, with Frances Buss as scorekeeper. ==Game play== Not much is known about the format of CBS Television Quiz; however, it has been noted for giving contestants the answers and requiring the questions, predating Jeopardy! As Merv Griffin was a teenager in San Francisco at the time, it is unlikely he was aware of it, although his future wife Julann may have seen it. According to Griffin, she had originally suggested the \\"answer- and-question\\" idea to him. ==Broadcast history== Televised game shows prior to the debut of CBS Television Quiz were \\"test episodes\\" for experimental purposes; one of these was Truth or Consequences (NBC Radio, July 1, 1941), while a show called Spelling Bee was broadcast (BBC, 1938). Quiz was the first regularly scheduled quiz program, but not the first to be sponsored, and aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 PM EST. On October 2 the series moved to Thursdays, and on January 8 the show was reduced to 55 minutes for the network to present a five-minute news summary at 9:25 PM. Quiz moved to Mondays on February 2 and was now preceded by a civilian-defense program (later an American Red Cross program), which along with the news summary required the show itself to decrease to 50 minutes. The Red Cross program ended on March 30, allowing Quiz to re-expand to 55 minutes. The series ended after 47 episodes on May 25, 1942, following a mandate two weeks earlier by the War Production Board to cease building television stations. Most of the shows then airing on both WCBW and WNBT, including Quiz, were removed in favor of war-related programming. Fates would later produce and/or direct many Goodson-Todman game shows on the network (most notably What's My Line?), while Buss (later Frances Buss Buch) became CBS' first female director. ==Episode status== CBS Television Quiz was aired live, prior to the adoption of kinescopes for recording programs and long before videotape. The show does not have any extant audio recordings or photographs, making it one of the few game shows to be completely lost. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Christopher H. Sterling and John M.

The president of Nigeria is also the commander-in-chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces. The president is elected in national elections which take place every four years. The offices, powers, and titles of the head of state and the head of government were officially merged into the office of the presidency under the 1979 Constitution of Nigeria. The current president, Muhammadu Buhari, took office on May 29, 2015, as the 15th president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. ==History== On October 1, 1960, Nigeria gained independence from Britain. An all-Nigerian Executive Council was headed by a prime minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. On November 16, 1960, Nnamdi Azikiwe became the first governor-general of a federation of three regions of the north, east and west, with Lagos as the Federal Capital. Each of the regions was headed by a premier with a governor as ceremonial head. On October 1, 1963, Nigeria became a Federal Republic and severed whatever ties were left with the British monarchy, but remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. An amendment to the 1960 Independence Constitution replaced the office of the governor-general with that of the president. Nnamdi Azikwe was sworn into that office on October 1, 1963. The office at that time was primarily ceremonial, and the main duties of the president were on such things as receiving foreign dignitaries and opening Parliament. In a January 1966 failed coup d'état, a group of army officers, led by Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu, overthrew the central and regional governments, killed the prime minister, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and tried to take control of the government. Nzeogwu was countered, captured and imprisoned by General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. General Aguiyi-Ironsi was named Military Head of State. In July 1966, a group of northern army officers revolted against the government, killed General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, and appointed the army chief of staff, General Yakubu Gowon as the head of the new military government. In 1975, General Yakubu Gowon was deposed and General Murtala Mohammed was the head of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria until his assassination in 1976. On his death, the chief-of-staff, Supreme Headquarters (equivalent to a vice-president) general Olusegun Obasanjo assumed office of head of state in a meeting of the Supreme Military Council, keeping the chain of command established by Murtala Muhammed in place. Gen. Obasanjo was responsible for completing the democratic transition begun by his predecessor, which culminated in an election in August 1979. In 1979, Nigeria adopted a federal presidential constitution. The presidency became an executive post, with powers similar to those of his American counterpart. The legislature was a bicameral National Assembly, comprising a Senate and House of Representatives. In October 1979, after more than 13 years of military rule, Nigeria returned to democratic rule. The National Party of Nigeria emerged victorious in the presidential election and Alhaji Shehu Shagari became the first democratically elected president. On December 31, 1983, the military overthrew the Second Republic. Major General Muhammadu Buhari emerged as the chairman of the Supreme Military Council (SMC), the new head of state. In August 1985, General Buhari's government was peacefully overthrown by the Army chief of staff, Major General Ibrahim Babangida. Babangida became the president and chairman of the Armed Forces Ruling Council. In August 1993, General Babangida stepped down and chose an interim government to replace him. Ernest Shonekan was named as interim president. General Sani Abacha seized power from Shonekan in November 1993 and became the president and chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council. On 8 June 1998, General Abacha died at the presidential villa in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. Major General Abdulsalami Abubakar became the new president and chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council. On 29 May, 1999 Major General Abdulsalami Abubakar stepped down, and the former military head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo, became the civilian president. Obasanjo served two terms in office. In May 2007, Alhaji Umaru Yar'Adua was sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the 13th head of state of Nigeria. Yar'Adua died on 5 May, 2010 in the presidential villa, in Abuja, Nigeria. On 6 May, 2010 Vice President Goodluck Jonathan was sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 14th head of state. On 29 May, 2015 Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the 15th head of state after winning the general election. ==Functions of the president of Nigeria== The president has the powers entrusted by the Constitution and legislation, including those necessary to perform the functions of head of state and head of the national executive. The president of Nigeria is responsible for: *Assenting to and signing bills *Referring a bill back to the National Assembly for reconsideration of the bill's constitutionality *Referring a bill to the Supreme Court for a decision on the bill's constitutionality *Summoning the National Assembly or Parliament to an extraordinary sitting to conduct special business *Making any appointments that the Constitution or legislation requires the president to make, other than as head of the national executive *Appointing commissions of inquiry *Appointing the Supreme Court justices of Nigeria on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council of Nigeria and subject to confirmation by the Senate *Calling a national referendum in terms of an act of Parliament *Receiving and recognising foreign diplomatic and consular representatives *Appointing ambassadors, plenipotentiaries, and diplomatic and consular representatives and other federal officers with the advice and consent of a majority of the Senate * Pardoning or reprieving offenders and remitting any fines, penalties or forfeitures *Conferring honours. ==Eligibility== Chapter VI, Part I, Section 131 of the constitution states that a person may be qualified for election of the office of the president if: * They are a citizen of Nigeria by birth; * They have attained the age of thirty five years; * They are a member of a political party and is sponsored by that political party; * They have been educated up to at least School Certificate level or its equivalent. A person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of the president if: * They have voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a country other than Nigeria (except in such cases as may be prescribed by the National Assembly) or they have made a declaration of allegiance to such other country; * They have been elected to such office at any two previous elections; * under the law in any part of Nigeria, They are adjudged to be a lunatic or otherwise declared to be of unsound mind; * They are under a sentence of death imposed by any competent court of law or tribunal in Nigeria or a sentence of imprisonment or fine for any offence involving dishonesty or fraud or for any other offence, imposed on them by any court or tribunal or substituted by a competent authority for any other sentence imposed on them by such a court of tribunal; * within a period of less than ten years before the date of the election to the office of President they have been convicted and sentenced for an offence involving dishonesty or they have been found guilty of the contravention of the Code of Conduct; * They are an undischarged bankrupt, having been adjudged or otherwise declared bankrupt under any law in force in Nigeria or any other country; * being a person employed in the civil or public service of the Federation or of any State, they have not resigned, withdrawn or retired from the employment at least thirty days before the date of the election; or * They are a member of any secret society; * They have been indicted for embezzlement or fraud by a Judicial Commission of Inquiry or an Administrative Panel of Inquiry or a Tribunal set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, a Tribunals of Inquiry law or any other law by the federal or state government which indictment has been accepted by the federal or state government respectively; * They have presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission. ==Oath of office== The Constitution of Nigeria specifies an oath of office for the president of the federation.

The genus is native to North America with the highest diversity on the western coast. Some species (e.g., C. americanus) are restricted to the eastern United States and southeast Canada, and others (e.g., C. caeruleus) extend as far south as Guatemala. Most are shrubs tall, but C. arboreus and C. thyrsiflorus, both native to California, can be small multi-trunked trees up to tall. ==Taxonomy and etymology== There are two subgenera within this genus: Ceanothus and Cerastes. The former clade is less drought-resistant, having bigger leaves. The evolution of these two clades likely started with a divergence in the niches filled in local communities, rather than a divergence on the basis of geography. The Californian species of Ceanothus are commonly known collectively as California lilacs, with individual species having more descriptive common names. Species native elsewhere have other common names such as New Jersey tea for C. americanus, as its leaves were used as a black tea substitute during the American Revolution. In garden use, most are simply called by their scientific names or an adaptation of the scientific name, such as 'Maritime ceanothus' for C. maritimus. ==Description== Ceanothus arboreus, illustrating the three parallel leaf veins characteristic of this genus ===Growth pattern=== The majority of the species are evergreen, but the handful of species adapted to cold winters are deciduous. The leaves are opposite or alternate (depending on species), small (typically 1–5 cm long), simple, and mostly with serrated margins. ===Leaves and stems=== Ceanothus leaves may be arranged opposite to each other on the stem, or alternate. Alternate leaves may have either one or three main veins rising from the base of the leaf.Native Shrubs of the Sierra Nevada, John Hunter Thomas, Dennis R. Parnell, University of California Press, 1974, p. 70–77, The leaves have a shiny upper surface that feels \\"gummy\\" when pinched between the thumb and forefinger, and the roots of most species have red inner root bark.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, ===Flowers and fruit=== Ceanothus fendleri blossom The flowers are white, greenish-white, blue, dark purple-blue, pale purple or pink, maturing into a dry, three-lobed seed capsule. The flowers are tiny and produced in large, dense clusters. A few species are reported to be intensely fragrant almost to the point of being nauseating, and are said to resemble the odor of \\"boiling honey in an enclosed area\\". The seeds of this plant can lie dormant for hundreds of years, and Ceanothus species are typically dependent on forest fires to trigger germination of their seeds. Fruits are hard, nutlike capsules.Flowering Plants of the Santa Monica Mountains, Nancy Dale, 2nd Ed., 2000, pp. 166–167 ==Distribution== Ceanothus americanus (fruit left, flowers right) Plants in this genus are widely distributed and can be found on dry, sunny hillsides from coastal scrub lands to open forest clearings, from near sea level to in elevation. These plants are profusely distributed throughout the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia south through Colorado, the Cascades of Oregon and California, and the Coastal Ranges of California. Ceanothus velutinus is the most common member of this genus and is widespread through much of western North America. The plants in this genus often co-occur with one another, especially when they are more distantly related. ==Species== Flowers of Ceanothus cuneatus (buck brush) in Pinnacles National Park , accepted species are: ==Uses== Ceanothus integerrimus (deerbrush) in Yosemite National Park ===Wildlife=== Ceanothus is a good source of nutrition for deer, specifically mule deer along the West Coast of the United States. However, the leaves are not as nutritious from late spring to early fall as they are in early spring. Porcupines and quail have also been seen eating stems and seeds of these shrubs. The leaves are a good source of protein and the stems and leaves have been found to contain a high amount of calcium. ===Cultivation=== Many Ceanothus species are popular ornamental plants for gardens. Dozens of hybrids and cultivars have been selected, such as flexible ceanothus, Ceanothus × flexilis (C. cuneatus × C. prostratus). ===AGM cultivars=== The following cultivars and hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (): *’Autumnal Blue’ *'Blue Mound' *'Burkwoodii' *'Cascade' *'Concha' *'Dark Star' *'Gloire de Versailles' *'Mystery Blue' *'Perle Rose' *'Puget Blue' *'Skylark' *'Topaze' *'Trewithen Blue' *C. thyrsifolius var. repens Other cultivars available include:- { - valign=top  *'Anchor Bay' Marcos Growers Horticulture Database: Ceanothus 'Anchor Bay' *'Diamond Heights' (variegated leaves)San Marcos Growers Horticulture Database: Ceanothus griseus horizontalis 'Diamond Heights'  *'Ray Hartman'Marcos Growers Horticulture Database: Ceanothus 'Ray Hartman' *'Snow Flurry'San Marcos Growers Horticulture Database: Ceanothus thyrsiflorus 'Snow Flurry' } There are also more cultivars and hybrids of Ceanothus arboreus, Ceanothus griseus horizontalis (groundcovers), and Ceanothus thyrsiflorus in the nursery trade. Propagation Propagation of ceanothus is by seed, following scarification and stratification. Seeds are soaked in water for 12 hours followed by chilling at 1 °C for one to three months. It can also sprout from roots and/or stems. Seeds are stored in plant litter in large quantities. It is estimated that there are about two million seeds per acre in forest habitats. Seeds are dispersed propulsively from capsules and, it has been estimated, can remain viable for hundreds of years. In habitat, the seeds of plants in this genus germinate only in response to range fires and forest fires. ===Other uses=== Native Americans used the dried leaves of this plant as an herbal tea, and early pioneers used the plant as a substitute for black tea. Miwok Indians of California made baskets from Ceanothus branches. Ceanothus integerrimus has been used by North American tribes to ease childbirth.Moerman, D. (1988). Native American Ethnobotany.

The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, and their relation with the prime minister and cabinets have over time differed with the various Portuguese constitutions. The current president of Portugal is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who took office on 9 March 2016. == Role == The Portuguese Third Republic is a semi-presidential system. Unlike several other European presidents, the Portuguese president is quite powerful. Although it is the prime minister of Portugal and parliament that oversee much of the nation's actual day-to-day affairs, the Portuguese president wields significant influence and authority, especially in the fields of national security and foreign policy (but less than other \\"strong\\" semi-presidential systems, such as France or Romania). The president is the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, holds the nation's most senior office, and outranks all other politicians. The president's greatest power is his ability to choose the prime minister. However, since the Assembly of the Republic has the sole power to dismiss the prime minister's government, the prime minister named by the president must have the confidence of the majority of the representatives in the assembly, otherwise he or she may face a motion of no confidence. The president has the discretionary power to dissolve parliament when sees it fit (colloquially known as the \\"atomic bomb\\" in Portugal), and President Sampaio made use of this prerogative in late 2004 to remove the controversial government of Pedro Santana Lopes, despite the absolute majority of deputies supporting the government. In 2003 President Sampaio also intervened to limit the Portuguese participation in the Iraq War - as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces he forbade the deployment of the Portuguese Army in a war that he personally disagreed with, clashing with the then–Prime-Minister José Manuel Barroso (128 National Republican Guards were eventually deployed from 2003 to 2005). Prior to the Carnation Revolution, the powers of the presidency varied widely; some presidents were virtual dictators (such as Pais, and Carmona in his early years), while others were little more than figureheads (such as Carmona in his later years, Craveiro Lopes, and Américo Tomás; during their administrations, supreme power was held by President of the Council of Ministers António de Oliveira Salazar). == Powers == The constitution grants the following powers to the president: * The president exercises the supreme commander of the Armed Forces and grand master of the Three Orders and shall appoint and remove, at the proposal of the government, the chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces and the military staff heads of the three branches the Armed Forces. * The president can dissolve the Assembly of the Republic, which implies the need to call for new legislative elections and after the implementation of these, the resignation of the government. * The president appoints the prime minister, given the election results, and appoints the other members of the government by proposal of the prime minister. He can, however, dismiss the government when this is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of democratic institutions. Even the government bodies of the autonomous regions may be dissolved by the president, by committing serious acts contrary to the Constitution. * The president declares a state of siege and emergency upon consultation with the government and with permission of the Parliament. * At the proposal of the government and with the authorization of the Parliament, the president can declare war in the event of actual or imminent aggression and can also propose peace. * The president promulgates or vetoes the promulgation of laws, decree-laws, regulatory decrees and other decrees of the government. * In the area of his powers in international relations, the president of the Republic ratifies international treaties. * The president decides on referendums put forth to him by Parliament. * The president of the Republic may request the Constitutional Court prior review of the constitutionality of the norms of international agreements or decrees that they have been sent for promulgation as an organic law, law or ordinance. * The president shall appoint and remove, in some cases a proposal from the government, holders of important state organs such as the representatives of the Republic for the autonomous regions, the president of the Supreme Court and the attorney general, five members of the Council of State and two members of the Supreme Judicial Council. * The president appoints ambassadors and special envoys, following proposal by the government, and accredits the foreign diplomatic representatives. * The president of the Republic, after consultation with the government, pardons and commutes sentences. == Election == Under the Portuguese Constitution adopted in 1976, in the wake of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the president is elected to a five-year term; there is no limit to the number of terms a president may serve, but a president who serves two consecutive terms may not serve again in the next five years after the second term finishes or in the following five years after his resignation. The official residence of the Portuguese president is the Belém Palace. The president is elected in a two-round system: if no candidate reaches 50% of the votes during the first round, the two candidates with the most votes face each other in a second round held two weeks later. However, the second round has only been needed once, during the 1986 presidential election. To date, all of the elected presidents since the Carnation Revolution have served for two consecutive terms, and presidents consistently rank as the most popular political figure in the country. Recently, however, the popularity of former president Aníbal Cavaco Silva plummeted, making him the second-least popular political figure in the country, just above the prime minister, and the first Portuguese president after 1974 to have a negative popularity. If the president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, the president of the Assembly assumes the office with restricted powers until a new president can be inaugurated following fresh elections. ==2016 presidential election== Summary of the 24 January 2016 Portuguese presidential election results -

He served as Archbishop of Vienna from 1986 to 1995, and became a cardinal in 1988. Pope John Paul II replaced him as archbishop after multiple allegations of sexual abuse of children, and at John Paul's request Groër relinquished all ecclesiastical duties and privileges as an archbishop and cardinal on 14 April 1998. ==Biography== Groër was born in Vienna to German parents, with whom he moved in 1929 to Czechoslovakia, where they remained for the next decade. He attended seminaries in Hollabrunn and Vienna (where he received his doctorate in theology) before being ordained to the priesthood on 12 April 1942 by Cardinal Theodor Innitzer. Groër then served as a chaplain in Petronell and Bad Vöslau until 1946, when he became Prefect of Studies at the minor seminary of Hollabrunn. He entered the Order of Saint Benedict in 1974 and took the name Hermann upon his solemn profession of vows on 8 September 1980. That same year Groër was named the spiritual director of the Legion of Mary for Austria. On 15 July 1986, he was appointed the fifteenth Archbishop of Vienna, succeeding Cardinal Franz König. Groër received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 September from König, with Archbishop Karl Berg and Bishop Stefan László serving as co-consecrators. He was created Cardinal Priest of Santi Gioacchino ed Anna al Tuscolano by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 28 June 1988. ==Sexual abuse of school boys, monks== In 1995, one of Groër's former school students accused him of sexual molestation. A number of others made similar charges shortly thereafter, as did some monks. Pope John Paul II promoted Christoph Schönborn from auxiliary bishop to Coadjutor Archbishop of Vienna on 13 April 1995 and later in the year accepted the resignation Groër had submitted as required on his 75th birthday in October 1994. Groër moved to the Roggendorf monastery, where he served as prior. When new allegations surfaced, Austrian church officials appealed to the pope, who initiated an investigation in February 1998. In April, at the pope's request, Groër resigned as prior and withdrew from public life. He released a statement that said: \\"In the past three years there have been many often incorrect statements concerning me. I ask God and the people for forgiveness if I have brought guilt upon myself.\\" After surrendering his church duties and duties as a Cardinal,https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/03/08/catholic-church-cardinals- implicated-in-sex-abuse-cover-ups/ Groër left Austria as part of a \\"self imposed exile\\" for several months and moved into a convent near Dresden, Germany.http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/25/local/me-groer25 He continued to work as a confessor in women's monasteries, received visitors and said Mass. Suffering from cancer, his health declined rapidly.Gerhard Heger, Hans Hermann Groër, Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon 26 (2006), pp. 529–534. Austria's statute of limitations prevented civil authorities from prosecuting Groër. In 2010, Cardinal Schönborn (elevated to that rank in 1998) said that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had attempted to convince Pope John Paul II to initiate the investigation and—in a conversation with journalists that Schönborn thought was private—said that Cardinal Angelo Sodano had blocked his attempt to investigate Groër's activities. Church officials are also alleged to have offered some of Groër's former pupils compensation in return for agreeing not to repeat their charges against him. Hubertus Czernin, author of a book about the case, believes that Groër abused more than 2,000 young men. Groër continued to deny the allegations until his death. ==Death and eulogies== The grave of Cardinal Groër, in the upper left an ex-voto tablet Groër died on 24 March 2003 of pneumonia at a hospital in Sankt Pölten, where he had been treated for cancer. Cardinal Schönborn presided at the requiem Mass in St. Stephan's Cathedral and in his homily honoured his predecessor's accomplishments in strengthening Marian devotions in the Archdiocese as well as fostering priestly and monastic vocations. The next day, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, referenced the charges against Groër in his eulogy only to describe how Groër had suffered, noting how Groër was \\"deeply wounded, even stigmatized by the incidents during his last years as Archbishop of Vienna\\", that \\"when the dark cloud gathered over his life ... he sank into loneliness and contempt\\". Groër was buried in the cemetery of Marienfeld Abbey, the Cistercian women's monastery he was instrumental in founding in 1974. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Biography, Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church Category:1919 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th- century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Archbishops of Vienna Category:Austrian cardinals Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals in Europe Category:Austrian military personnel of World War II Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Hans Hermann Groër"},{"id":"516113","text":"The president of Tunisia, formally known as the president of the Republic of Tunisia (, ), is the head of state of Tunisia. Tunisia is a semi-presidential republic, whereby the president is the head of state and the prime minister (named Head of Government of Tunisia) is head of government. Under Article 77 of the Constitution of Tunisia, the president is also the commander-in-chief of the Tunisian Armed Forces. The current president is Kais Saied who held this position since 23 October 2019 following the death of Beji Caid Essebsi on 25 July 2019. ==Elections== The president is directly elected by universal suffrage by majority, with a second round between the top two candidates, if neither receives an absolute majority in the first round. A presidential candidate must be at least 35 years old on the day of filing for candidacy, and must be a Muslim. The candidate must have a Tunisian nationality, and must abandon any other nationality. ==Role and powers== The president's role and powers are defined in title four, part one of the constitution. In addition to being the head of state, the president is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president is limited to a maximum of two terms, and may not hold a partisan position while serving as president. The president and the prime minister have executive roles, with the executive power being exercised by the president and the government (dual executive). The Assembly of the Representatives of the People has the right to, by majority, present a motion to impeach the president for a grave violation of the constitution; such a motion would have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of both the Assembly and the Constitutional Court. Article 77 specifies that the president is responsible for the general state of defence, foreign policy and national security, after consultation with the head of government. Article 78 specifies that the president is responsible for appointing and dismissing: * The Grand Mufti of the Tunisian Republic * Individuals in senior positions in the Presidency of the Republic and dependent institutions. * Individuals in senior military and diplomatic positions, and related to national security, after consultation with the Head of Government. * The head of the central bank, upon proposal from the head of government after approval from the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. Article 80 specifies that in exceptional circumstances, the president, after consultation with the government and the president of the Assembly, may take measures necessitated by the circumstances. Article 81 specifies that the president has the responsibility of signing laws, and ensure their publication. With the exception of draft constitutional laws, the president has the right to return laws to the assembly with an explanation. A returned law requires approval by an absolute majority of assembly members (as opposed to a majority of members present), or in the case of an organic law, three-fifths of the assembly members. Article 82 specifies that the president may in exceptional circumstances put certain draft laws to a referendum. Article 87 specifies that the president enjoys legal immunity while in office. ==History== Since the promulgation of a republican constitution in June 1959, three years after gaining independence from France, Tunisia has had just four directly elected presidents. The first president was Habib Bourguiba, who became the country's first president after the proclamation of a republic in 1957; he had been the country's de facto leader as prime minister since independence in 1956. He was formally elected to the post in 1959, and was proclaimed president for life in 1975. He was removed from office in a coup d'état in 1987 by Prime Minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after being declared medically unfit to continue in office. Ben Ali ascended as acting president, was elected in his own right in 1989 and served until 2011, when he was forced from office during an uprising against his rule. In the country's first free presidential election, held in December 2014, Beji Caid Essebsi was elected in the second round. For most of its history as an independent state, Tunisia lacked political democracy in the Western sense, and saw widespread violations of human rights. Because of this, presidential elections in Tunisia, such as that of 2009, lacked international credibility. Elections resulted in implausibly high margins for the ruling party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally and its previous incarnations as the Neo Destour party and the Socialist Destourian Party. Prior to 1999, presidential candidates had to be endorsed by at least 30 political figures—a realistic possibility only for a candidate from a well-organized party like the RCD. Given the RCD's near-total domination of Tunisian politics, opposition candidates found it impossible to get their nomination papers signed. Even when this requirement was lifted, incumbent Ben Ali was reelected three more times by implausibly high margins; his lowest margin was 89 percent in 2009. Tunisia's original republican constitution vested the president with sweeping executive and legislative powers. Indeed, within the context of the system, he was a virtual dictator. He was elected for a term of five years, with no term limits. In 1975, five months after winning his third full term, Bourguiba was named president for life. From 1987 to 2002, a president was limited to three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row. However, this provision was removed in June 2002. The 2014 Constitution retained the presidency as the key institution, but hedged it about with numerous checks and balances to prevent a repeat of past authoritarian excesses. Most notably, a president is limited to two five-year terms, even if they are non- successive. The Constitution explicitly forbids any amendment to increase the length of a president's term or allow him to run for more than two terms. Under the current constitution, the president is primarily responsible for foreign policy, defense and national security, while the Head of Government (prime minister) is responsible for domestic policy. ==2011 presidential transition== Following Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's ousting in January 2011, prime minister Mohamed Ghannouchi invoked article 56 of the Constitution regarding temporary absence of the president to assume the role of acting president. This move was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court hours later and President of the Chamber of Deputies Fouad Mebazaa was appointed as acting president based on article 57 of the Constitution regarding permanent absence of the president.Ahram On December 12, 2011, Moncef Marzouki was elected by the newly formed Constituent Assembly as interim president of the Republic. ==Living former presidents== The three living former Tunisian presidents, including one acting president : File:Fouad Mebazaa 15 jan 2011.jpgFouad Mebazaa (2011) File:Moncef Marzouki2.jpgMoncef Marzouki (2011–2014) File:Mohamed Ennaceur.jpgMohamed Ennaceur (acting) (2019) ==Latest election== { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=2 colspan=2Candidate !rowspan=2Party !colspan=2First round !colspan=2Second round - !Votes !% !Votes !% -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftKais Saiedalign=leftIndependent620,71118.402,777,93172.71 -  bgcolor=#DC143C align=leftNabil Karouialign=leftHeart of Tunisia525,51715.581,042,89427.29 -  bgcolor=#0066CC align=leftAbdelfattah Mouroualign=leftEnnahda Movement434,53012.88colspan=2 rowspan=24 -  bgcolor=#FF0000 align=leftAbdelkrim Zbidialign=leftIndependent361,86410.73 -  bgcolor=#A91101 align=leftYoussef Chahedalign=leftLong Live Tunisia249,0497.38 -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftSafi Saïdalign=leftIndependent 239,9517.11 -  bgcolor=#005A9D align=leftLotfi Mraihialign=leftRepublican People's Union221,1906.56 -  bgcolor=#3D7254 align=leftSeifeddine Makhloufalign=leftDignity Coalition147,3514.37 -  bgcolor=#CC6668 align=leftAbir Moussialign=leftFree Destourian Party135,4614.02 -  bgcolor=#FE6500 align=leftMohamed Abboualign=leftDemocratic Current122,2873.63 -  bgcolor=silver align=leftMoncef Marzoukialign=leftMovement Party100,3382.97 -  bgcolor=#022351 align=leftMehdi Jomaaalign=leftTunisian Alternative61,3711.82 -  bgcolor=#C90133 align=leftMongi Rahouialign=leftPopular Front27,3550.81 -  bgcolor=#C49A6C align=leftHechmi Hamdialign=leftCurrent of Love25,2840.75 -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftHamma Hammamialign=leftIndependent23,2520.69 -  bgcolor=#660000 align=leftElyes Fakhfakhalign=leftEttakatol11,5320.34 -  bgcolor=#EEEEEE align=leftSaïd Aïdialign=leftBeni Watani10,1980.30 -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftOmar Mansouralign=leftIndependent10,1600.30 -  bgcolor=#000000 align=leftMohsen Marzoukalign=leftMachrouu Tounes7,3760.22 -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftHamadi Jebalialign=leftIndependent7,3640.22 -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftNéji Jalloulalign=leftIndependent7,1660.21 -  bgcolor=#EEEEEE align=leftAbid Brikialign=leftTunisia Forward5,7990.17 -  bgcolor=#fe0000 align=leftSelma Elloumi Rekikalign=leftAl Amal5,0930.15 -  bgcolor=#DDDDdd align=leftMohamed Esghaier Nourialign=leftIndependent4,5980.14 -  bgcolor=#EEEEEE align=leftSlim Riahialign=leftNew National Union 4,4720.13 -  bgcolor=#DDDDDD align=leftHatem Boulabiaralign=leftIndependent3,7040.11 - align=left colspan=3Blank votes23,867 –  – - align=left colspan=3Invalid votes68,344 –  – - align=left colspan=3'Total3,465,184100.00 ' 100.00 - align=left colspan=3Registered voters/turnout7,074,56648.98 7,074,56655.02 - align=left colspan=7Source: ISIE, ISIE } ==See also== *Tunisia **List of Beys of Tunis **List of French residents-general in Tunisia **List of Presidents of Tunisia **List of Presidents of Tunisia by age **First Lady of Tunisia **Head of Government of Tunisia *Lists of office-holders *List of current heads of state and government == References == Category:1957 establishments in Tunisia da:Tunesiens præsidenter id:Daftar Presiden Tunisia ka:ტუნისის პრეზიდენტი mn:Тунисын ерөнхийлөгч ja:チュニジアの大統領 pl:Prezydenci Tunezji sl:Seznam predsednikov Tunizije ","title":"President of Tunisia"},{"id":"516114","text":"Świecino (Kashubian: Swiecëno, German: Schwetzin) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Krokowa, within Puck County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

It was originally developed in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP-based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection, and in additive manufacturing as a light source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects. Smaller \\"pico\\" chipsets are used in mobile devices including cell phone accessories and projection display functions embedded directly into phones. == Digital micromirror device == Diagram of a Digital micromirror showing the mirror mounted on the suspended yoke with the torsion spring running bottom left to top right (light grey), with the electrostatic pads of the memory cells below (top left and bottom right) In DLP projectors, the image is created by microscopically small mirrors laid out in a matrix on a semiconductor chip, known as a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). These mirrors are so small that DMD pixel pitch may be 5.4 µm or less. Each mirror represents one or more pixels in the projected image. The number of mirrors corresponds to the resolution of the projected image (often half as many mirrors as the advertised resolution due to wobulation). 800×600, 1024×768, 1280×720, and 1920×1080 (HDTV) matrices are some common DMD sizes. These mirrors can be repositioned rapidly to reflect light either through the lens or onto a heat sink (called a light dump in Barco terminology). Rapidly toggling the mirror between these two orientations (essentially on and off) produces grayscales, controlled by the ratio of on-time to off-time. == Color in DLP projection == There are two primary methods by which DLP projection systems create a color image: those used by single-chip DLP projectors, and those used by three-chip projectors. A third method, sequential illumination by three colored light emitting diodes, is being developed, and is currently used in televisions manufactured by Samsung. === Single-chip projectors === { style=\\"width:300px; float:right; border:1px solid #ccc; background:#f9f9f9; font-size:88%; line-height:1.5em; margin: 5px;\\" -  align=\\"center\\"  70px  align=\\"center\\"  70px  align=\\"center\\"  70px  align=\\"center\\"  70px -  colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"  300px -  colspan=\\"4\\" width=300px Interior view of a single-chip DLP projector, showing the light path. Light from the lamp enters a reverse-fisheye, passes through the spinning color wheel, crosses underneath the main lens, reflects off a front-surfaced mirror, and is spread onto the DMD (red arrows). From there, light either enters the lens (yellow) or is reflected off the top cover down into a light-sink (blue arrows) to absorb unneeded light. Top row shows overall components, closeups of 4-segment RGBW color wheel, and light-sink diffuser/reflection plate on top cover. } In a projector with a single DLP chip, colors are produced either by placing a color wheel between a white lamp and the DLP chip or by using individual light sources to produce the primary colors, LEDs or lasers for example. The color wheel is divided into multiple sectors: the primary additive colors: red, green, and blue, and in many cases white (clear). Newer systems substitute the primary subtractive colors cyan, magenta, and yellow for white. The use of the subtractive colors is part of the newer color performance system called BrilliantColor which processes the additive colors along with the subtractive colors to create a broader spectrum of possible color combinations on the screen. The DLP chip is synchronized with the rotating motion of the color wheel so that the green component is displayed on the DMD when the green section of the color wheel is in front of the lamp. The same is true for the red, blue and other sections. The colors are thus displayed sequentially at a sufficiently high rate that the observer sees a composite \\"full color\\" image. In early models, this was one rotation per frame. Now, most systems operate at up to 10× the frame rate. The black level of a single-chip DLP depends on how unused light is being disposed. If the unused light is scattered to reflect and dissipate on the rough interior walls of the DMD / lens chamber, this scattered light will be visible as a dim gray on the projection screen, when the image is fully dark. Deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios are possible by directing unused HID light away from the DMD / lens chamber into a separate area for dissipation, and shielding the light path from unwanted internal secondary reflections.  The color wheel \\"rainbow effect\\"  The rainbow effect found in DLP projectors utilizing a mechanical spinning wheel.DLP projectors utilizing a mechanical spinning color wheel may exhibit an anomaly known as the \\"rainbow effect\\". This is best described as brief flashes of perceived red, blue, and green \\"shadows\\" observed most often when the projected content features high contrast areas of moving bright or white objects on a mostly dark or black background. Common examples are the scrolling end credits of many movies, and also animations with moving objects surrounded by a thick black outline. Brief visible separation of the colours can also be apparent when the viewer moves their eyes quickly across the projected image. Some people perceive these rainbow artifacts frequently, while others may never see them at all. This effect is caused by the way the eye follows a moving object on the projection. When an object on the screen moves, the eye follows the object with a constant motion, but the projector displays each alternating color of the frame at the same location for the duration of the whole frame. So, while the eye is moving, it sees a frame of a specific color (red, for example). Then, when the next color is displayed (green, for example), although it gets displayed at the same location overlapping the previous color, the eye has moved toward the object's next frame target. Thus, the eye sees that specific frame color slightly shifted. Then, the third color gets displayed (blue, for example), and the eye sees that frame's color slightly shifted again. This effect is not perceived only for the moving object, but the whole picture. Multi-color LED-based and laser- based single-chip projectors are able to eliminate the spinning wheel and minimize the rainbow effect, since the pulse rates of LEDs and lasers are not limited by physical motion. Three-chip DLP projectors function without color wheels, and therefore do not manifest this rainbow artifact.\\"The Great Technology War: LCD vs. DLP. By Evan Powell, December 7, 2005. Accessed online at: http://www.projectorcentral.com/lcd_dlp_update7.htm?page=Rainbow- Artifacts. Accessed on Dec. 27, 2011. === Three-chip projectors === A three- chip DLP projector uses a prism to split light from the lamp, and each primary color of light is then routed to its own DMD chip, then recombined and routed out through the lens. Three chip systems are found in higher-end home theater projectors, large venue projectors and DLP Cinema projection systems found in digital movie theaters. According to DLP.com, the three-chip projectors used in movie theaters can produce 35 trillion colors. The human eye is suggested to be able to detect around 16 million colors , which is theoretically possible with the single chip solution. However, this high color precision does not mean that three-chip DLP projectors are capable of displaying the entire gamut of colors we can distinguish (this is fundamentally impossible with any system composing colors by adding three constant base colors). In contrast, it is the one-chip DLP projectors that have the advantage of allowing any number of primary colors in a sufficiently fast color filter wheel, and so the possibility of improved color gamuts is available. === Light source === The InFocus IN34, a DLP projector DLP technology is independent of the light-source and as such can be used effectively with a variety of light sources. Historically, the main light source used on DLP display systems has been a replaceable high-pressure xenon arc lamp unit (containing a quartz arc tube, reflector, electrical connections, and sometimes a quartz/glass shield), whereas most pico category (ultra-small) DLP projectors use high-power LEDs or lasers as a source of illumination.  Xenon arc lamps  For xenon arc lamps, a constant-current supply is used, which starts with a sufficiently high open-circuit voltage (between 5 and 20kV, depending on lamp) to cause an arc to strike between the electrodes, and once the arc is established, the voltage across the lamp drops to a given value (typically 60 volts) while the current increases to a level required to maintain the arc at optimal brightness. As the lamp ages, its efficiency declines, due to electrode wear, resulting in a reduction in visible light and an increase in the amount of waste heat. The lamp's end of life is typically indicated by an LED on the unit or an onscreen text warning, necessitating replacement of the lamp unit. Continued operation of the lamp past its rated lifespan may result in a further decrease in efficiency, the lightcast may become uneven, and the lamp may eventually become hot enough to the point that the power wires can melt off the lamp terminals. Eventually, the required startup voltage will also rise to the point where ignition can no longer occur. Secondary protections such as a temperature monitor may shut down the projector, but a thermally over-stressed quartz arc tube can also crack and/or explode. Practically all lamp housings contain heat-resistant barriers (in addition to those on the lamp unit itself) to prevent the red-hot quartz fragments from leaving the area.  LED-based DLPs  The first commercially available LED-based DLP HDTV was the Samsung HL-S5679W in 2006, which also eliminated the use of a color wheel. Besides long lifetime eliminating the need for lamp replacement and elimination of the color wheel, other advantages of LED illumination include instant-on operation and improved color, with increased color saturation and improved color gamut to over 140% of the NTSC color gamut. Samsung expanded the LED model line-up in 2007 with products available in 50-, 56- and 61-inch screen sizes. In 2008, the third generation of Samsung LED DLP products were available in 61\\" (HL61A750) and 67\\" (HL67A750) screen sizes. Ordinary LED technology does not produce the intensity and high-lumen output characteristics required to replace arc lamps. The special patented LEDs used in all of the Samsung DLP TVs are PhlatLight LEDs, designed and manufactured by US-based Luminus Devices. A single RGB PhlatLight LED chipset illuminates these projection TVs. The PhlatLight LEDs are also used in a new class of ultra-compact DLP front projector commonly referred to as a \\"pocket projector\\" and have been introduced in new models from LG Electronics (HS101), Samsung electronics (SP-P400) and Casio (XJ-A series). Home Theater projectors will be the next category of DLP projectors that will use PhlatLight LED technology. At InfoComm, June 2008 Luminus and TI announced their collaboration on using their technology on home theater and business projectors and demonstrated a prototype PhlatLight LED-based DLP home theater front projector. They also announced products will be available in the marketplace later in 2008 from Optoma and other companies to be named later in the year. Luminus Devices PhlatLight LEDs have also been used by Christie Digital in their DLP-based MicroTiles display system. It is a modular system built from small (20 inch diagonal) rear projection cubes, which can be stacked and tiled together to form large display canvasses with very small seams. The scale and shape of the display can have any size, only constrained by practical limits.  Laser- based DLPs  The first commercially available laser-based DLP HDTV was the Mitsubishi L65-A90 LaserVue in 2008, which also eliminated the use of a color wheel. Three separate color lasers illuminate the digital micromirror device (DMD) in these projection TVs, producing a richer, more vibrant color palette than other methods. See the laser video display article for more information. == Digital cinema == DLP CINEMA. A Texas Instruments Technology Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype Projector, Mark V, 2000 The NEC Cinema DLP projector in 2006 DLP Cinema systems have been deployed and tested commercially in theatres since 1999. In June 1999, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace was the first movie to be entirely scanned and distributed to theaters. Four theaters installed digital projectors for the movie's release. The same was done for the traditional and computer-animated hybrid film Tarzan that same year. Later that year, Toy Story 2 was the first movie to be entirely created, edited, and distributed digitally, with more theaters installing digital projectors for its release. DLP Cinema was the first commercial digital cinema technology and is the leading digital cinema technology with approximately 85% market share worldwide as of December 2011. Digital cinema has some advantages over film because film can be subject to color fading, jumping, scratching and dirt accumulation. Digital cinema allows the movie content to remain of consistent quality over time. Today, most movie content is also captured digitally. The first all-digital live action feature shot without film was the 2002 release, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. DLP Cinema does not manufacture the end projectors, but rather provides the projection technology and works closely with Barco, Christie Digital and NEC who make the end projection units. DLP Cinema is available to theatre owners in multiple resolutions depending on the needs of the exhibitor. These include, 2K – for most theatre screens, 4K - for large theatre screens, and S2K, which was specifically designed for small theatres, particularly in emerging markets worldwide. On February 2, 2000, Philippe Binant, technical manager of Digital Cinema Project at Gaumont in France, realized the first digital cinema projection in EuropeCahiers du cinéma, n°hors-série, Paris, April 2000, p. 32. with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments. DLP is the current market-share leader in professional digital movie projection,Texas Business largely because of its high contrast ratio and available resolution as compared to other digital front-projection technologies. As of December 2008, there are over 6,000 DLP- based Digital Cinema Systems installed worldwide. DLP projectors are also used in RealD Cinema and newer IMAX theatres for 3-D films. == Manufacturers and marketplace == 56 inch DLP rear-projection TV Since being introduced commercially in 1996, DLP technology has quickly gained market share in the front projection market and now holds greater than 50% of the worldwide share in front projection in addition to 85% market share in digital cinema worldwide. Additionally, in the pico category (small, mobile display) DLP technology holds approximately 70% market share. Over 30 manufacturers use the DLP chipset to power their projection display systems. === Pros === * Smooth (at 1080p resolution), jitter-free images. * Perfect geometry and excellent grayscale linearity achievable. * Usually excellent ANSI contrast. * The use of a replaceable light source means a potentially longer life than CRTs and plasma displays (this may also be a con as listed below). * The light source is more-easily replaceable than the backlights used with LCDs, and on DLPs is often user-replaceable. * The light from the projected image is not inherently polarized. * New LED and laser DLP display systems more or less eliminate the need for lamp replacement. * DLP offers affordable 3D projection display from a single unit and can be used with both active and passive 3D solutions. * Lighter weight than LCD and plasma televisions. * Unlike their LCD and plasma counterparts, DLP screens do not rely on fluids as their projection medium and are therefore not limited in size by their inherent mirror mechanisms, making them ideal for increasingly larger high-definition theater and venue screens. * DLP projectors can process up to seven separate colors, giving them a wider color gamut. === Cons === The rear panel of a Mitsubishi XD300U shows the output and input jacks which are available. * Some viewers are bothered by the \\"rainbow effect\\" present in colour-wheel models - particularly in older models (explained above). This can be observed easily by using a camera's digital viewfinder on projected content. * Rear projection DLP TVs are not as thin as LCD or plasma flat-panel displays (although approximately comparable in weight), although some models as of 2008 are becoming wall-mountable (while still being 10\\" to 14\\" thick)Futurelooks.com * Replacement of the lamp / light bulb in lamp-based units. The life span of an arc lamp averages 2000–5000 hours and the replacement cost for these range from $99 – 350, depending on the brand and model. Newer generations' units use LEDs or lasers which effectively eliminate this issue, although replacement LED chips could potentially be required over the extended lifespan of the television set. * Some viewers find the high pitch whine of the color wheel to be an annoyance. However, the drive system can be engineered to be silent and some projectors don't produce any audible color wheel noise. * Dithering noise may be noticeable, especially in dark image areas. Newer (post ~2004) chip generations have less noise than older ones. * Error-diffusion artifacts caused by averaging a shade over different pixels, since one pixel cannot render the shade exactly * Response time in video games may be affected by upscaling lag. While all HDTVs have some lag when upscaling lower resolution input to their native resolution, DLPs are commonly reported to have longer delays. Newer consoles that have HD output signals do not have this problem as long as they are connected with HD-capable cables. * Reduced viewing angle as compared to direct-view technologies such as CRT, plasma, and LCD * May use more electricity, and generate more heat, than competing technologies. === DLP, LCD, and LCoS rear projection === The most similar competing system to DLP is known as LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon), which creates images using a stationary mirror mounted on the surface of a chip, and uses a liquid crystal matrix (similar to a liquid crystal display) to control how much light is reflected. DLP-based television systems are also arguably considered to be smaller in depth than traditional projection television. == See also == *3LCD *Comparison of display technology *Handheld projector *Inflatable movie screen *Large-screen television technology *Laser video display *Liquid crystal on silicon *Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) *Surface-conduction electron- emitter display (SED) == References == == Further reading == *Binant, Philippe.

Run from London's West End, the manufacturer was based in the Midlands and the distribution and dealers business in the south of England. In the decade beginning 1928 the Rootes brothers, William and Reginald, made prosperous by their very successful distribution and servicing business, were keen to enter manufacturing for closer control of the products they were selling. One brother has been termed the power unit, the other the steering and braking system.Coventry Standard 29 June 1956 With the financial support of Prudential Assurance, the two brothers bought some well-known British motor manufacturers, including Hillman, Humber, Singer, Sunbeam, Talbot, Commer and Karrier, controlling them through their parent, Rootes' 60-per-cent-owned subsidiary, Humber Limited. At its height in 1960, Rootes had manufacturing plants in the Midlands at Coventry and Birmingham, in southern England at Acton, Luton and Dunstable, and a brand-new plant in the west of Scotland at Linwood. From its offices in Devonshire House, Piccadilly, in London it controlled exports and international distribution for Rootes and other motor manufacturers and its own local distribution and service operations in London, Kent, Birmingham and Manchester. There were assembly plants in nine countries outside the UK. Rootes Group was under-capitalised and unable to survive industrial relations problems and losses from the 1963 introduction of a new aluminium-engined small car, the Hillman Imp. By mutual agreement, from mid-1964, Rootes Motors was taken over in stages by Chrysler Corporation, which bought control from the Rootes family in 1967. By the end of 1978 the last of the various elements of Chrysler UK had been sold to Peugeot and Renault.Motor-Cars, The Times, Tuesday, 3 May 1927; p. 2; Issue 44571 ==History and corporate developmentDealer and distributor for other manufacturers=== Rootes was founded in Hawkhurst, Kent, in 1913 by William Rootes as a car sales agency independent from his father's Hawkhurst motor business. Rootes had moved his operations to Maidstone by 1914 and there he contracted to repair aero engines. In 1917 he formed Rootes Limited to buy the Maidstone branch of his father's motor business, founded by his father in 1897, to expand his aircraft engine repair business and the manufacture of aircraft parts. In 1919 the distribution of cars and commercial vehicles resumed and operations extended to London and other part of the country.Prospectus, Rootes Motors Limited. The Times, 21 November 1949; p. 8; Issue 51544 As early as 1924 Rootes had become the largest truck and car distributor in the United Kingdom.Kent and Sussex Courier, 25 April 2008, p. 28 They advertised that their showrooms in Devonshire House Piccadilly could supply new cars priced from £145 to £3,000 manufactured by Rolls-Royce, Daimler, Sunbeam, Austin, Hillman, Fiat or Clyno. ===Manufacturing — Humber Limited=== Hillman 14, 1930 Hillman Minx, 1935 Humber 16-60, 1933 Hillman Hawk 3-litre, 1936 Humber Twelve Vogue pillarless, 1937 A particular effort was put into overseas sales and it became clear the export opportunities warranted a move into car manufacture, which was achieved in 1928 by the purchase of controlling interests in first Hillman Motor Car Company Limited followed a year later by Humber Limited and Commercial Cars Limited. Hillman and Commer were made wholly owned subsidiaries of Humber Limited and the Rootes brothers' holding eventually became 60 percent of the Humber ordinary shares. The Rootes brothers could now show their ability to manufacture handsome cars with a strong sales appeal. ===Humber Cycles=== There was a resurgence in domestic and export demand for pedal bicycles, and in February 1932 Raleigh acquired all the Humber cycles trade marks. Manufacture was transferred to Raleigh's Nottingham works.Roger Lloyd-Jones, Myrddin John Lewis, Mark Eason, Raleigh and the British Bicycle Industry: An Economic and Business History, 1870–1960, Ashgate Publishing, 2000. ===Rootes Securities Limited=== Rootes Limited was renamed Rootes Securities Limited in 1933. During the Depression more businesses were picked up as they came available: Karrier Motors Limited 1934, Sunbeam Motor Company Limited 1934, Clement Talbot Limited 1934 and British Light Steel Pressings Limited 1937 were all bought and made subsidiaries of Humber Limited. London's Mayfair coachbuilders and Rolls-Royce and Daimler dealers Thrupp & Maberly Limited had been bought in 1926 their royal warrant always proudly displayed. ===Rootes Ltd and exports=== A new Rootes Limited was incorporated in 1933 to hold the very profitable core business of the Rootes brothers: the motor distribution and servicing functions, and its extension and development of export markets. It had been the largest truck and car distributor in the United Kingdom in 1924 and generated the capital to buy manufacturer Hillman, merge Hillman with manufacturer Humber and give the Rootes brothers control of Humber and the manufacturing subsidiaries they would have Humber buy. Overseas representation of British motor manufacturers was not limited to group members.Rover-Rootes Move. The Times, 2 March 1950; p. 11; Issue 51629. ===Ownership and control, Rootes family=== 'Rootes Motors Limited' was the new name assumed 16 November 1949 of holding company Rootes Securities Limited. Substantially the whole of 1917's initial capital had been provided by the two Rootes brothers. Thereafter the business's expansion was financed by retained profits supplemented where necessary, for example the purchase of Hillman, by loans from The Prudential Assurance Company Limited and the company's bankers principally Midland Bank. On 24 November 1949 shares in Rootes Motors Limited were issued to the public in exchange for £3,025,000. Rootes was now a public listed company and the new capital repaid the Prudential and Midland Bank loans. The listed shares however were preference shares. The equity capital remained in the hands of the Rootes family now with new partner Prudential who had taken up all of the offered £1,000,000 of ordinary shares. External shareholders continued to hold a large proportion of Humber Limited. The preference shares issued to the public by Humber remained listed.City Notes. The Times, Monday, 21 November 1949; p. 8; Issue 51544 In addition there were external shareholdings in the Rootes Acceptances vehicle exporting business and in Automobile Products of India Limited.Rootes Motors Limited. The Times, Friday, 29 December 1950; p. 10; Issue 51885 At this time employees totalled 17,000. Rootes owned, on average, about 80 per cent of the capital of its subsidiaries. The manufacturing subsidiaries were held through partly owned Humber Limited. Manufacture was carried out in three factories in Coventry with more at Luton, Cricklewood and Acton. There was a wholly owned assembly plant in Australia and similar facilities owned with associates in Argentina, Eire and India. From Devonshire House in Piccadilly the original business, the marketing subsidiary, directed operations at five branches in Kent, their North Kensington service department and Birmingham and Manchester branches together with distribution companies overseas sometimes jointly owned. Barely twelve months after listing preference shares the Rootes brothers recognised the effect death duties would have on their holdings and their businesses and the two brothers offered one quarter of Rootes Motors' ordinary shares to current holders of Rootes preference shares.News in Brief.The Times, 3 October 1950; p. 6; Issue 51812City Notes.

The Times, 26 October 1959; p. 17; Issue 54601 ===World War II=== A Bristol Blenheim bomber With the outbreak of the Second World War Rootes, like most other British car manufacturers, became involved with the production of armaments. In 1940, under the Government's shadow factory scheme, Rootes built its massive assembly plant in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, near Coventry, initially manufacturing aircraft, one of the first types being the Bristol Blenheim. Production included an RAF heavy bomber, the Handley Page Halifax. These were built at a shadow factory at Speke Airport near Liverpool and at Blythe Bridge in Staffordshire from 1941 to 1943. Rootes also manufactured military vehicles, based on the Humber and Commer. Rootes had a rare lapse of business judgement shortly after WWII. When he visited the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg to evaluate it for war reparations, he opined that it – and the Beetle – had no value. ===Postwar acquisitions=== Tilling- Stevens Limited with its subsidiary Vulcan Motors, both old-established and well-known commercial vehicle and bus manufacturers, was bought in the second half of 1950. A new acquisition in 1956 was Singer Motors Limited.Rootes To Take Over Singers. The Times, 30 December 1955; p. 8; Issue 53415 Rootes' Singers, badge-engineered Hillmans, were aimed at slightly more upmarket small car buyers. ===Post-war development=== Hillman Minx Series IIIC. The \\"Audax\\" Minx (Series I to VI) was designed by Raymond Loewy. Following the war, Rootes also sponsored satellite manufacturing operations around the world, notably in Australasia (Rootes Australia) and the Middle East. The best known example of the latter was the Iranian-built Paykan, based on the Hillman Hunter. In 1950 it acquired Tilling-Stevens, a truck and bus manufacturer based in Maidstone, Kent. Rootes successfully sold a range of cars priced at a slight premium to their major home market competitors, justified on the basis that they offered a level of superiority in design and finish. Studebaker stylist Raymond Loewy was a design consultant to Rootes; evidence of his influence is most readily seen in the 1956 Audax range of cars, which included the contemporary Hillman Minx, a model also produced under licence by Isuzu Motors of Japan as the Isuzu Hillman Minx. ===Engineering innovation=== Rootes introduced a novel supercharged diesel engine in 1954, based on a Sulzer Brothers concept. This was the Commer TS3 2-stroke 3-cylinder engine, with 2 opposed inward facing pistons per cylinder, which drove the crankshaft through rockers. The 3.25 litre engine developed , equivalent to contemporary 4-stroke diesel engines of more than twice the capacity. The engine was used in Commer trucks as well as an industrial engine. Production ceased in 1968 after the Chrysler takeover. ===Range rationalisation=== Hillman Minx Magnificent, 1937 Hillman when purchased had been making large cars. They introduced a straight-eight soon after Hillman became a subsidiary, but it was withdrawn as the Depression deepened. Their 2-1/2 and 3-litre cars were re-styled in the mid-1930s and renamed Humber Snipe and their small Minx was made the mainstay \\"bread and butter\\" member of the Rootes range. Sunbeam continued its sports appeal but downsizing postwar to small to medium-sized cars. Humber made the larger luxury passenger vehicles, Snipes and variants, and luxury mid-size cars ending with the compact Sceptre. The intervening break in medium-sized Humbers was filled by the postwar Sunbeams. Commer and Karrier were the commercial vehicle brands. Commer manufactured a full range of vans, trucks, tractors and bus chassis, and some badge-engineered small vehicles from the Hillman range. Karrier represented mainly municipal and special-purpose trucks, vans and buses, though towards the end included badge-engineered models from the Commer range. ===Sunbeam Tiger=== During the 1960s, Sunbeam's Alpine convertible was moderately successful in the US market. Rootes considered that the Alpine's sales would be improved with a more powerful model. As a result, in 1964 they introduced the Tiger, a V8 derivative powered by a Ford V8 engine. Carroll Shelby was involved in the development of the Tiger prototype. A model followed in 1967, but few were built as it was considered inappropriate for a Chrysler vehicle to be powered by Ford. Consideration was given to installing a Chrysler V8 in the Tiger, but their engines were larger and heavier than the Ford engines, and the rear-mounted distributor would have required an unaffordable chassis design, given the limited sales. === Hillman Imp and the move to Linwood === The rear-engine Hillman Imp never caught on with the buying public. In 1963, Rootes introduced the Hillman Imp, a compact rear- engined saloon with an innovative all-aluminium OHC engine, based on a Coventry Climax engine design (originally used for a fire pump). It was intended to be a response from Rootes to rival BMC's popular Mini, and a new factory in Linwood, Renfrewshire was built for its assembly. The move to Linwood was forced upon the company by the British government, which had introduced the principle of \\"industrial development certificates\\" (IDCs) to build factories in depressed areas. The Linwood workforce had no experience in motor vehicle assembly and the build quality and reliability of the cars suffered. Another problem was that the component suppliers were still based in the Midlands, and the company incurred costs transporting half-finished engine castings from Linwood to be machined at Ryton and returned to Linwood once they had been assembled. Completed Imps returned south to Ryton, resulting in a round trip. The Imp itself was underdeveloped, and the build quality and reliability problems, coupled with buyer apathy towards the design were reflected in poor sales. After a reasonably successful start in 1963–65, the Imp did not sell well. Lost production caused by frequent strike action at Linwood and escalating warranty claims left Rootes no money to develop other models. ===Competition history=== A Sunbeam-Talbot 90 won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1955 During the 1950s, Rootes's promotion included a strategy of participation in major UK and European car rallies. Stirling Moss and Sheila van Damm were their top drivers, and the Sunbeam-Talbot 90's win in the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally was the most significant victory. In 1968, Rootes entered a factory team in the London-Sydney Marathon. Driving a Hillman Hunter, Andrew Cowan gained what was regarded as a surprise victory against stiff competition from other factory teams with bigger budgets. ===Business strategy=== William Rootes' particular business skills were in marketing. \\"He was a supersalesman par excellence\\".Butterworth J. B. (rev. Bloomfield G.T.) \\"Rootes, William Edward, first Baron Rootes (1894–1964)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Subscription or library access may be required for online access. Accessed 9 August 2015 Rootes brothers' manufacturing business was best known for solid, dependable, well-engineered middle-market vehicles always of attractive appearance. Well-known Rootes models include the Hillman Minx, its successor the Hillman Hunter, the Humber Super Snipe and the Sunbeam Alpine. William Rootes built the Rootes Group using specific brands for each market niche. ===Management succession=== Following the death in 1964 of Lord Rootes, his son, William Geoffrey Rootes, became the second Lord Rootes and became the new chairman of Rootes Motors. On 1 May 1967 Lord Rootes appointed Gilbert Hunt, a Wolverhampton-born business executive, who at the time was managing director of Massey-Ferguson in the UK, to be the new managing director of the Rootes Group. Hunt's appointment was made with the support of the Chrysler Corporation, which was building its holding and control over the business during this period. ==Chrysler== In June 1964 Rootes Motors announced Chrysler Corporation would take a 30 per cent interest in their ordinary capital offering current shareholders double the market price and a 50 per cent share in the non-voting preference capital for almost three times market price. The purchase would leave control in British hands.Motor Firms' Big Deal.

The Times, 1 July 1970; p. 27; Issue 57906 ===Chrysler (1967–78)=== It has been suggested that the demise of Rootes began with losses due to industrial relations problems at their BLSP plant in London, with knock-on problems down the supply chain. By the mid-1960s, Rootes was progressively taken over by the Chrysler Corporation of the United States, following huge losses amid the commercial failure of the troubled Imp. The company's financial year ran to 31 July, and in the year ended 31 July 1967 Rootes was able to report a pre-tax profit of just £3.8 million. It was the first reported profit since 1964 and compared with a pretax loss of £10.7 million in the year ending in 1966. Lack of funds for new model investment was a striking feature of the company's final decade. Chrysler was also keen to take control of the struggling firm as it wished to have its own wholly independent European subsidiaries like archrivals Ford and GM. Chrysler took over Simca of France and Barreiros of Spain at the same time, merging it with Rootes (now renamed \\"Chrysler UK\\") to create Chrysler Europe. The Rootes name had largely vanished by 1971, and its other brand names were progressively phased out during the 1970s. Only Hillman was left by 1977, when it, too, was shelved in favour of the Chrysler name. The Commer name was also phased out in the 1970s, the group's van and truck models mostly assuming the Dodge nameplate by 1976. In Iacocca—an Autobiography, former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca was disparaging of the Rootes operation, writing that Chrysler should never have bought it. Chrysler UK continued with a range of rear-wheel-drive family cars such as the Hillman Avenger (introduced in 1970) and Hillman Hunter (introduced in 1966), while the Imp — which by now had most of its teething problems ironed out — was largely ignored by the new management. The Imp's commercial chances were not helped by the launch of new imports in the early 1970s including the Fiat 127 and Renault 5, which helped spearhead a rise in the popularity of imported cars on the UK market. In the late 1960s, Chrysler endeavoured to market the Rootes cars in the US. These efforts proved unsuccessful. Marketing in the US was impeded by an inability to offer cars for sale during part of 1968, as the Rootes cars could not comply with exhaust emission requirements. The Hillman Avenger was produced between 1970 and 1981. In the early 1970s, with the rise of interest in sub-compact cars, Chrysler offered the Hillman Avenger in North America as the Plymouth Cricket. This attempt was aborted after only two years. At the same time, Chrysler's Dodge Division offered the Dodge Colt as its \\"subcompact\\"—sourced from Mitsubishi in Japan. The Colt proved a popular and reliable car, hastening the Cricket's demise. However, Chrysler of Argentina commenced manufacturing the Hillman Avenger-based Dodge 1800, and this car continued in production until 1990. During its last 10 years of production it was badged as a Volkswagen after that firm acquired Chrysler's Argentine business. There was also a Brazilian variant until 1980. By the early 1970s, Chrysler Europe was working on the development of two new family car ranges which would be produced at both its British and French plants, and sold under both the Chrysler and Simca marques on the relevant markets - similar to the integration of British and German model ranges which its rivals Ford and General Motors were carrying out at the time. The Chrysler Alpine (sold in France as the Simca 1307/1308) was introduced in 1975, being produced at the former Rootes plant at Ryton as well as the former Simca plant at Poissy, near Paris. The Chrysler Sunbeam a three-door hatchback based on the Avenger floorpan, was introduced in 1977 as successor to the Hillman Imp. Also, Chrysler UK made a significant contribution to the design of Chrysler's European range. As well as the Alpine and Sunbeam, there was the saloon derivative of the Alpine, the Talbot Solara (launched in early 1980 after Chrysler sold its European operations to Peugeot), and Chrysler/Simca Horizon. The Alpine and Horizon were both voted \\"European Car of the Year on their launch, and the Horizon was the basis for the US Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, which were very successful for Chrysler and continued in production in various guises for more than a decade. The Chrysler Sunbeam kept the company going in the later 1970s. The Imp was finally discontinued in 1976, and the Hunter followed it three years later (although it continued to be produced in Iran). Indeed, componentry for the Iranian version of the car was a successful UK export during the 1980s. Only the Avenger-based Chrysler Sunbeam hatchback, launched in 1977 kept the Rootes lineage alive, although the Alpine name was still in use and later Alpine and Solara special edition models were given the old Rootes model names, Minx and Rapier. The rights to the Rapier name remained with the successors of the company, and were eventually resurrected again on a few limited edition Peugeot models. There was also a special Sceptre edition of the 205, 405 and the 605 SRi models. This used a black plastic badge with the chrome effect Sceptre cursive script similar to that on the sideflashes of the '60s saloons. In the case of the Peugeot cars, the Sceptre badging was applied to the bootlid and lower aft part of the front wing. Chrysler had spent much of the 1970s unsuccessfully trying to integrate its Rootes and Simca ranges into one, coherent whole. The traditionally engineered, rear-wheel-drive cars of the British division had limited appeal outside the UK, although the Avenger and Hunter—the first locally assembled car to reach a total of 30,000 units sold in its 12-year lifespan—were both relatively successful in New Zealand. Hunter production continued there and in Ireland until 1979, and it was built in Iran by Iran Khodro as the Peykan for many years more. Unfortunately, with its problems in the US, Chrysler did not have the capital to invest in refreshing their entire product range, and sales of the older designs stagnated in the face of more modern competition. Also, the production facilities were outmoded, industrial relations problems were persistent, and the products had a poor reputation for quality. In the face of massive losses, and the risk of high unemployment in the surrounding areas if the factories closed, the Ryton and Linwood factories were the subject of frequent government bail-outs. ==Peugeot (1978–2007)== Despite the government assistance, the weight of problems bearing on Chrysler Europe resulted in its collapse in 1977, leading to the company's 1978 takeover by PSA Peugeot- Citroen. PSA soon wielded the axe over the troubled Linwood factory in Scotland, and exhumed the Talbot marque from the pages of Rootes' history to re-badge the former Chrysler and Simca badged models. Whilst Ryton was saved, PSA took little interest in the heavy commercial vehicles and the former Commer/Dodge/Karrier truck and van factory was run in conjunction with the trucks division of Renault. After the withdrawal of the last Dodge-derived trucks (latterly badged as Renaults) it became an engine production plant for Renault Véhicules Industriels. The 309 was the first Peugeot assembled in the Ryton plant. The first Rootes model to be discontinued under Peugeot's ownership was the Hunter in 1979, and its production tooling subsequently went to Iran, where the Paykan went into local production, which continued until 2004. It remains a common sight throughout the Middle East, especially as a taxi. The closure of Linwood in 1981 spelled the end (in Europe at least) for the Avenger. Chrysler had retained the rights to the car, and continued its production in Argentina. The demise of Linwood also meant the demise of the Talbot Sunbeam after just four years in production. Its successor was the French built Talbot Samba, based on the Peugeot 104, and which went on sale in the UK in February 1982. By this stage, however, Peugeot was a year away from unveiling its highly acclaimed new 205 supermini, although it was originally planned that Peugeot would launch a Talbot badged supermini on the 205 platform as well as a Citroen some time around the mid 1980s. The Simca-based models (the Horizon, Alpine and Solara) continued to be built at Ryton, using the resurrected Talbot badge from 1979. However, the Talbot-badged models declined in popularity over the next few years, with sales dropping from nearly 120,000 on the UK market in 1979 to around 25,000 in 1984, while as the same time the Peugeot brand was gaining ground thanks to the success of the 205. By 1985 PSA had announced that it would abandon the three-marque strategy on passenger cars, and the Horizon replacement, developed as the Talbot Arizona, became the Peugeot 309 when it was launched in the autumn of 1985, and was the first Peugeot-badged car to be assembled at the Ryton plant. The Arizona's styling was mismatched with the rest of the range, making it resemble an enlarged Simca 1108. The Talbot badge was discontinued on passenger cars, with the Alpine, Solara and Samba all finishing production in May 1986, and the last Horizon models leaving the production lines in Spain and Finland a year later. The Talbot brand survived on the Express van - part of a venture between Peugeot and Fiat - until 1994. The Ryton plant was initially retained and went on to assemble the Peugeot 405 alongside the 309 from 1987, as well as the 309's successor (the Peugeot 306) from late 1992, and finally the Peugeot 206 from 1998. The Peugeot 206 was the last car assembled at Ryton. Ryton began assembling its last Peugeot, the 206, in 1998. At the height of the car's success, the plant was working at capacity to satisfy demand. Ryton's importance in PSA's overall strategy was as an assembly operation with limited production capacity compared to PSA's main factories in France and Spain - particularly as its location between two main roads made expansion impossible. In April 2006, after years of speculation surrounding Ryton's future, the PSA Group announced that production of the Peugeot 206 would be shifted to Slovakia and the Ryton plant would close within the next year. Production at the plant ceased on 12 December 2006. It marked the end of nearly 60 years of car manufacturing at Ryton, and severed the motor industry's final remaining direct link with the Rootes Group. More than 2,000 jobs were lost as a result of the factory's closure. It was demolished soon after. The only physical remnant of the Rootes Group still in existence is the Whitley research and development centre - originally established during the Chrysler era, but subsequently sold by PSA and is now owned by Jaguar Land Rover. Grade II listed Rootes building in Mill Street, Maidstone ==Commemorations== Maidstone, where William Rootes set up his business in 1914, managed to keep the Rootes name on their building until 2007. Built in 1938-39 for Rootes it is listed Grade II.\\"The Rootes car showroom and workshops, Mill Street, Maidstone, is designated at Grade II for the following principal reasons: * The building is of architectural interest as an example of a Modernist motorcar showroom and workshops which retains a significant proportion of its original fabric. * The building is of architectural interest due to its grand scale, town-centre location and picturesque setting adjacent to the Len mill pond, which distinguishes it from other buildings associated with the motorcar industry during this phase of early motoring. * The building is a prominent manifestation of a hugely successful British car manufacturer, built in a period when the expansion of car ownership was having a revolutionary impact on the physical and social fabric of the nation.\\" Historic England accessed 26 April 2019 On 1 January 2007, in line with the other 40 dealerships within its business group, the name was changed from Rootes Maidstone, to Robins & Day Maidstone.

Rootes' contribution to Coventry's history is commemorated by the University of Warwick in the naming of Rootes Hall, one of its largest halls of residence, on the main campus site on the outskirts of Coventry. The name lives on in the short access to the Rootes Estate, a housing estate built in the early 1990s on most of the Ladbroke Grove site of the Clément-Talbot car factory.The Rootes Estate Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Accessed 26 April 2019 The main access to the redevelopment, Shrewsbury Street, is named after the founder of Clément-Talbot, Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury. Soon after the Second World War the group of Clément-Talbot factory buildings was converted to a Rootes Group London administration and service depot which was later bought by Warwick Wright. One of the original buildings remains, the Talbot administration block now known as Ladbroke Hall, with the earl's crest high above its main entrance. A tenant, Sunbeam studios, is named after the Sunbeam-Talbot car briefly produced there from 1938-1939 and 1945-1946. In the housing area there are short links one named Humber Drive and a Hillman Drive each side of a small park and there is a Sunbeam Crescent. ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Rootes Archive Centre Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of England Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:Former defence companies of the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Manufacturing companies based in London Category:British companies established in 1913 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1913 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1971 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1913 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1971 Category:1913 establishments in England Category:1971 disestablishments in England Category:Chrysler Category:Defunct companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Defunct companies based in Kent Category:Hawkhurst Category:Defunct companies based in London Category:Defunct companies based in Manchester Category:British companies disestablished in 1971 ","title":"Rootes Group"},{"id":"516137","text":"The Fraser River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey.

The Fraser River starts near Berthoud Pass. As it runs north for its first 8 miles, it is on National Forest land and is publicly accessible. The river is narrow and shallow here, but worthy of fishing. From Winter Park to Fraser, the river can be accessed by the Fraser River Trail (hiking or mountain bikes), from USFS campgrounds, or road turnouts. The only exception is as the river flows through private land in the town of Winter Park. You can go fishing in the forested lands, or where the river starts into the valley. Access to the Fraser River is limited downstream from the town of Fraser. Some of the best fishing is in the canyon downstream from Tabernash, however this is on private land. ==See also== *List of rivers of Colorado *List of tributaries of the Colorado River ==References== Category:Rivers of Grand County, Colorado Category:Tributaries of the Colorado River in Colorado ","title":"Fraser River (Colorado)"},{"id":"516138","text":"Singularitarianism is a movement defined by the belief that a technological singularity—the creation of superintelligence—will likely happen in the medium future, and that deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the singularity benefits humans. Singularitarians are distinguished from other futurists who speculate on a technological singularity by their belief that the singularity is not only possible, but desirable if guided prudently. Accordingly, they might sometimes dedicate their lives to acting in ways they believe will contribute to its rapid yet safe realization. Time magazine describes the worldview of Singularitarians by saying that \\"even though it sounds like science fiction, it isn't, no more than a weather forecast is science fiction. It's not a fringe idea; it's a serious hypothesis about the future of life on Earth. There's an intellectual gag reflex that kicks in anytime you try to swallow an idea that involves super-intelligent immortal cyborgs, but... while the Singularity appears to be, on the face of it, preposterous, it's an idea that rewards sober, careful evaluation\\". \\"2045: The Year Man Becomes Immortal\\" Time Magazine, February 2011 ==Definition== The term \\"Singularitarian\\" was originally defined by Extropian thinker Mark Plus (Mark Potts) in 1991 to mean \\"one who believes the concept of a Singularity\\". This term has since been redefined to mean \\"Singularity activist\\" or \\"friend of the Singularity\\"; that is, one who acts so as to bring about the singularity. Singularitarianism can also be thought of as an orientation or an outlook that prefers the enhancement of human intelligence as a specific transhumanist goal instead of focusing on specific technologies such as A.I. There are also definitions that identify a singularitarian as an activist or a friend of the concept of singularity, that is, one who acts so as to bring about a singularity. Some sources described it as a moral philosophy that advocates deliberate action to bring about and steer the development of a superintelligence that will lead to a theoretical future point that emerges during a time of accelerated change. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, author of the 2005 book The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, defines a Singularitarian as someone \\"who understands the Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own life\\" and estimates the singularity will occur around 2045. ==History== In 1993, mathematician, computer scientist, and science fiction author Vernor Vinge hypothesized that the moment might come when technology will allow \\"creation of entities with greater than human intelligence\\"The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era, by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge. and used the term \\"the Singularity\\" to describe this moment. He suggested that the singularity may pose an existential risk for humanity, and that it could happen through one of four means: #The development of computers that are \\"awake\\" and superhumanly intelligent. #Large computer networks (and their associated users) may \\"wake up\\" as a superhumanly intelligent entity. #Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent. #Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect.The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era, by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge. Singularitarianism coalesced into a coherent ideology in 2000 when artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote The Singularitarian Principles,Singularitarian Principles\\" in which he stated that a Singularitarian believes that the singularity is a secular, non-mystical event which is possible and beneficial to the world and is worked towards by its adherents. Yudkowsky's conceptualization of singularity offered a broad definition developed to be inclusive of various interpretations. There are theorists such as Michael Anissimov who argued for a strict definition, one that refers only to the advocacy of the development of posthuman (greater than human) intelligence. In June 2000 Yudkowsky, with the support of Internet entrepreneurs Brian Atkins and Sabine Atkins, founded the Machine Intelligence Research Institute to work towards the creation of self-improving Friendly AI. MIRI's writings argue for the idea that an AI with the ability to improve upon its own design (Seed AI) would rapidly lead to superintelligence. These Singularitarians believe that reaching the singularity swiftly and safely is the best possible way to minimize net existential risk. Many people believe a technological singularity is possible without adopting Singularitarianism as a moral philosophy. Although the exact numbers are hard to quantify, Singularitarianism is a small movement, which includes transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, who predicts that the Singularity will occur circa 2045, greatly contributed to popularizing Singularitarianism with his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology . With the support of NASA, Google and a broad range of technology forecasters and technocapitalists, the Singularity University opened in June 2009 at the NASA Research Park in Silicon Valley with the goal of preparing the next generation of leaders to address the challenges of accelerating change. In July 2009, many prominent Singularitarians participated in a conference organized by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard (i.e., cybernetic revolt). They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi- autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They warned that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \\"cockroach intelligence\\". They asserted that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man By John Markoff, NY Times, July 26, 2009. Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.Call for debate on killer robots, By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09. The President of the AAAI has commissioned a study to look at this issue.AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09. ==Reception== There are several objections to Kurzweil's singularitarianism and these even include criticisms from optimists within the A.I. field. For instance, Pulitzer Prize winning author Douglas Hofstadter argued that Kurzweil's predicted achievement of human-level A.I. by 2045 is not viable. Even Gordon Moore, who is credited for introducing the Moore's Law that predicated the notion of singularity, maintained that it will never occur. According to some observers, these criticisms do not diminish enthusiasm for singularity because it has assumed a quasi-religious response to the fear of death, allowing its adherents to enjoy the benefits of religion without its ontological burdens. Science journalist John Horgan provided more insights into this notion as he likened singularitarianism to a religion: Kurzweil rejects this categorization, stating that his predictions about the singularity are driven by the data that increases in computational technology have been exponential in the past.Will Google's Ray Kurzweil Live Forever?, Wall Street Journal interview, April 12, 2013 He also stressed that critics who challenge his view mistakenly take an intuitive linear view of technological advancement. ==See also== * Artificial general intelligence * Eschatology * Existential risk from artificial general intelligence * Global brain * Intelligence explosion * Outline of transhumanism * Post-scarcity economy * Technological utopianism ==References== == External links == * Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence by Nick Bostrom, 2003 * \\"The Consciousness Conundrum\\", a criticism of singularitarians by John Horgan Category:Futures studies Category:Prediction Category:Philosophy of artificial intelligence Category:Systems thinking Category:Technology forecasting Category:Technology neologisms Category:Transhumanism ","title":"Singularitarianism"},{"id":"516142","text":"Air India Flight 855 was a scheduled passenger flight that crashed during the evening of New Year's Day 1978 about off the coast of Bandra, Bombay (now Mumbai). All 213 passengers and crew on board were killed. The crash is believed to have been caused by the captain having become spatially disoriented after the failure of one of the flight instruments in the cockpit. It was Air India's deadliest aircraft crash until the bombing of Flight 182 in 1985. It was also the deadliest aviation accident in India until the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision in 1996. , Flight 855 is still the second deadliest aircraft crash in both of these categories. ==Aircraft and crew== The aircraft involved was a Boeing 747-237B,The aircraft was a Boeing 747-200B model; Boeing assigns a unique code for each company that buys one of its aircraft, which is applied as an infix to the model number at the time the aircraft is built, hence \\"747-237B\\" for a Boeing 747-200B built for Air India. registration named Emperor Ashoka. It was the first 747 delivered to Air India, in April 1971. The flight crew consisted of the following persons: * The captain was 51-year old Madan Lal Kukar. He had joined Air India in 1956, and was experienced, having 18,000 flight hours. * The first officer was 42-year-old Indu Virmani, a former Air Force commander who joined Air India in 1976. He had 4,000 flight hours. * The flight engineer was 53-year-old Alfredo Faria, who joined Air India in 1955 and had 11,000 flight hours, making him one of Air India's most senior flight engineers at the time of the accident. == Sequence of events == The aircraft departed from Bombay's Santa Cruz Airport (later Sahar Airport, now called Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport). The destination was Dubai International Airport in Dubai. Approximately one minute after takeoff from runway 27, Captain Kukar made a scheduled right turn upon crossing the Bombay coastline over the Arabian Sea, after which the aircraft briefly returned to a normal level position. Soon it began rolling to the left, and never regained level flight. The cockpit voice recorder recovered from the wreckage revealed that captain Kukar was the first to notice a problem, when he said, \\"What's happened here, my instruments ...\\" The captain was explaining that his attitude indicator (AI) had \\"toppled\\", meaning that it was still showing the aircraft in a right bank. First officer Virmani, whose presumably functional AI was now showing a left bank (and not noticing the captain's concern), said, \\"Mine has also toppled, looks fine.\\" It is believed that the Captain mistakenly took this to mean that both primary AIs were indicating a right bank, in effect confirming what he believed he was seeing. It was after sunset and the aircraft was flying over a dark Arabian Sea, leaving the aircrew unable to visually cross- check their AI instrument readings with the actual horizon outside the cockpit windows. The Boeing 747 had a third backup AI in the center instrument panel between the two pilots, and the transcripts of the cockpit conversation showed flight engineer Faria telling the captain, \\"Don't go by that one, don't go by that one...\\" trying to direct his attention towards that third AI, or perhaps to another instrument called the turn and bank indicator, just five seconds before the aircraft impacted the sea. The captain's mistaken perception of the aircraft's attitude resulted in him using the aircraft flight control system to add more left bank and left rudder, causing the Boeing 747 to roll further left into a bank of 108 degrees and rapidly lose altitude. Just 101 seconds after leaving the runway, the jet hit the Arabian Sea at an estimated 35-degree nose-down angle. There were no survivors among the 190 passengers and 23 crew members. == Probable cause == The partially recovered wreckage revealed no evidence of explosion, fire, or any electrical or mechanical failure; and an initial theory of sabotage was ruled out. The investigation concluded that the probable cause was \\"due to the irrational control inputs by the captain following complete unawareness of the attitude as his AI had malfunctioned. The crew failed to gain control based on the other flight instruments.\\" US Federal District Judge James M. Fitzgerald, in a 139-page decision issued 1 November 1985, rejected charges of negligence against the Boeing Company, Lear Siegler Inc, the manufacturer of the attitude director indicator, and the Collins Radio division of Rockwell International, which manufactured the backup system in a suit related to the crash. Steven C. Marshall, the attorney for Boeing asserted that the crash had been caused by Captain Madan Kukar, who he said was \\"flying illegally under the influence of diabetic drugs, a condition compounded by his alcoholic intake and dieting in the 24 hours before the flight,\\" and not due to equipment malfunctions. The suit was dismissed in 1986. == See also == *Sensory illusions in aviation *John F.

Transverse modes occur in radio waves and microwaves confined to a waveguide, and also in light waves in an optical fiber and in a laser's optical resonator.\\"Transverse electromagnetic mode\\" Transverse modes occur because of boundary conditions imposed on the wave by the waveguide. For example, a radio wave in a hollow metal waveguide must have zero tangential electric field amplitude at the walls of the waveguide, so the transverse pattern of the electric field of waves is restricted to those that fit between the walls. For this reason, the modes supported by a waveguide are quantized. The allowed modes can be found by solving Maxwell's equations for the boundary conditions of a given waveguide. ==Types of modes== Unguided electromagnetic waves in free space, or in a bulk isotropic dielectric, can be described as a superposition of plane waves; these can be described as TEM modes as defined below. However in any sort of waveguide where boundary conditions are imposed by a physical structure, a wave of a particular frequency can be described in terms of a transverse mode (or superposition of such modes). These modes generally follow different propagation constants. When two or more modes have an identical propagation constant along the waveguide, then there is more than one modal decomposition possible in order to describe a wave with that propagation constant (for instance, a non-central Gaussian laser mode can be equivalently described as a superposition of Hermite-Gaussian modes or Laguerre-Gaussian modes which are described below). ===Waveguide modes=== Field patterns of some commonly used waveguide modes Modes in waveguides can be further classified as follows: ; Transverse electromagnetic (TEM) modes: Neither electric nor magnetic field in the direction of propagation. ; Transverse electric (TE) modes: No electric field in the direction of propagation. These are sometimes called H modes because there is only a magnetic field along the direction of propagation (H is the conventional symbol for magnetic field). ; Transverse magnetic (TM) modes: No magnetic field in the direction of propagation. These are sometimes called E modes because there is only an electric field along the direction of propagation. ; Hybrid modes: Non-zero electric and magnetic fields in the direction of propagation. Hollow metallic waveguides filled with a homogeneous, isotropic material (usually air) support TE and TM modes but not the TEM mode. In coaxial cable energy is normally transported in the fundamental TEM mode. The TEM mode is also usually assumed for most other electrical conductor line formats as well. This is mostly an accurate assumption, but a major exception is microstrip which has a significant longitudinal component to the propagated wave due to the inhomogeneity at the boundary of the dielectric substrate below the conductor and the air above it. In an optical fiber or other dielectric waveguide, modes are generally of the hybrid type. In rectangular waveguides, rectangular mode numbers are designated by two suffix numbers attached to the mode type, such as TEmn or TMmn, where m is the number of half-wave patterns across the width of the waveguide and n is the number of half-wave patterns across the height of the waveguide. In circular waveguides, circular modes exist and here m is the number of full-wave patterns along the circumference and n is the number of half-wave patterns along the diameter.F. R. Connor, Wave Transmission, pp.52-53, London: Edward Arnold 1971 .U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS), NAVMARCORMARS Operator Course, Chapter 1, Waveguide Theory and Application, Figure 1-38.—Various modes of operation for rectangular and circular waveguides. ==Laser modes== Cylindrical transverse mode patterns TEM(pl) In a laser with cylindrical symmetry, the transverse mode patterns are described by a combination of a Gaussian beam profile with a Laguerre polynomial. The modes are denoted where and are integers labeling the radial and angular mode orders, respectively. The intensity at a point (,) (in polar coordinates) from the centre of the mode is given by: :I_{pl} (\\\\rho, \\\\varphi) = I_0 \\\\rho^l \\\\left[L_p^l (\\\\rho)\\\\right]^2 \\\\cos^2 (l\\\\varphi) e^{-\\\\rho} where , is the associated Laguerre polynomial of order and index , and is the spot size of the mode corresponding to the Gaussian beam radius. With , the TEM00 mode is the lowest order. It is the fundamental transverse mode of the laser resonator and has the same form as a Gaussian beam. The pattern has a single lobe, and has a constant phase across the mode. Modes with increasing show concentric rings of intensity, and modes with increasing show angularly distributed lobes. In general there are spots in the mode pattern (except for ). The mode, the so-called doughnut mode, is a special case consisting of a superposition of two modes (), rotated with respect to one another. The overall size of the mode is determined by the Gaussian beam radius , and this may increase or decrease with the propagation of the beam, however the modes preserve their general shape during propagation. Higher order modes are relatively larger compared to the mode, and thus the fundamental Gaussian mode of a laser may be selected by placing an appropriately sized aperture in the laser cavity. In many lasers, the symmetry of the optical resonator is restricted by polarizing elements such as Brewster's angle windows. In these lasers, transverse modes with rectangular symmetry are formed. These modes are designated with and being the horizontal and vertical orders of the pattern. The electric field pattern at a point (,,) for a beam propagating along the z-axis is given by :E_{mn}(x, y, z) = E_0 \\\\frac{w_0}{w} H_m\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}x}{w}\\\\right)H_n\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}y}{w}\\\\right)\\\\exp\\\\left[-(x^2 + y^2)\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{w^2} + \\\\frac{jk}{2R}\\\\right) - jkz - j(m + n + 1)\\\\zeta\\\\right] where w_0, w(z), R(z), and \\\\zeta(z) are the waist, spot size, radius of curvature, and Gouy phase shift as given for a Gaussian beam; E_0 is a normalization constant; and H_k is the th physicist's Hermite polynomial. The corresponding intensity pattern is :I_{mn}(x, y, z) = I_0 \\\\left( \\\\frac{w_0}{w} \\\\right)^2 \\\\left[ H_m \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{2} x}{w} \\\\right) \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{-x^2}{w^2} \\\\right) \\\\right]^2 \\\\left[ H_n \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{2} y}{w} \\\\right) \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{-y^2}{w^2} \\\\right) \\\\right]^2 Rectangular transverse mode patterns TEM(mn) The TEM00 mode corresponds to exactly the same fundamental mode as in the cylindrical geometry. Modes with increasing and show lobes appearing in the horizontal and vertical directions, with in general lobes present in the pattern. As before, higher-order modes have a larger spatial extent than the 00 mode. The phase of each lobe of a is offset by radians with respect to its horizontal or vertical neighbours. This is equivalent to the polarization of each lobe being flipped in direction. The overall intensity profile of a laser's output may be made up from the superposition of any of the allowed transverse modes of the laser's cavity, though often it is desirable to operate only on the fundamental mode. ==Modes in an optical fiber== The number of modes in an optical fiber distinguishes multi-mode optical fiber from single-mode optical fiber. To determine the number of modes in a step-index fiber, the V number needs to be determined: V = k_0 a \\\\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2} where k_0 is the wavenumber, a is the fiber's core radius, and n_1 and n_2 are the refractive indices of the core and cladding, respectively. Fiber with a V-parameter of less than 2.405 only supports the fundamental mode (a hybrid mode), and is therefore a single-mode fiber whereas fiber with a higher V-parameter has multiple modes. Decomposition of field distributions into modes is useful because a large number of field amplitudes readings can be simplified into a much smaller number of mode amplitudes. Because these modes change over time according to a simple set of rules, it is also possible to anticipate future behavior of the field distribution. These simplifications of complex field distributions ease the signal processing requirements of fiber-optic communication systems. The modes in typical low refractive index contrast fibers are usually referred to as LP (linear polarization) modes, which refers to a scalar approximation for the field solution, treating it as if it contains only one transverse field component.K.

It is owned and operated by the Arturo L.A. Arena Company and Anschutz Entertainment Group. The arena is home venue to the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). The Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League (AFL) and the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League were also tenants; the Avengers were folded in 2009, and the D-Fenders moved to the Lakers' practice facility at the Toyota Sports Center in El Segundo, California for the 2011–12 season. Staples Center is also host to over 250 events and nearly 4 million guests each year. It is the only arena in the NBA shared by two teams, as well as one of only three North American professional sports venues to host two teams from the same league; MetLife Stadium, the home of the National Football League's New York Giants and New York Jets, is one; SoFi Stadium, the home of the National Football League's Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams, is the other. Staples Center is the venue of the Grammy Awards ceremony and will host the basketball competition during the 2028 Summer Olympics.

Roski of Majestic Realty and Philip Anschutz. Roski and Anschutz had acquired the Los Angeles Kings in 1995 and in 1996 began looking for a new home for their team, which then played at the Forum in Inglewood. Majestic Realty Co. and AEG were scouring the Los Angeles area for available land to develop an arena when they were approached by Steve Soboroff, then president of the LA Recreation and Parks Commission. Soboroff requested that they consider building the arena in downtown Los Angeles adjacent to the convention center. This proposal intrigued Roski and Anschutz, and soon a plan to develop the arena, the current Staples Center, was devised. Months of negotiations ensued between Anschutz and city officials, with Roski and John Semcken of Majestic Realty Co. spearheading the negotiations for the real estate developers. The negotiations grew contentious at times and the real estate developers threatened to pull out altogether on more than one occasion. The main opposition came from Councilman Joel Wachs, who opposed utilizing public funds to subsidize the proposed project, and councilwoman Rita Walters, who objected to parts of it. Ultimately, the developers and city leaders reached an agreement, and in 1997, construction broke ground on the new building, which opened two years later. It was financed privately at a cost of US$375 million and is named for the office-supply company Staples, Inc., which was one of the center's corporate sponsors that paid for naming rights. The arena opened on October 17, 1999, with a Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band concert as its inaugural event. On October 21, 2009, Staples Center celebrated its 10th anniversary. To commemorate the occasion, the venue's official web site nominated 25 of the arena's greatest moments from its first ten years with fans voting on the top ten. During the late summer of 2010, modifications were made to the arena, including refurbished locker rooms for the Clippers, Kings, and Lakers and the installation of a new US$10 million HD center-hung video scoreboard and jumbotron, replacing the original one that had been in place since the building opened in 1999. The Panasonic Live 4HD scoreboard was officially unveiled on September 22, 2010, as AEG and Staples Center executives, as well as player representatives from the Clippers (Craig Smith), Kings (Matt Greene), and Lakers (Sasha Vujacic) were on hand for the presentation. Following the sudden death of former basketball player Kobe Bryant in January 2020, a number of media outlets picked up on a phrase used by some, referring to the stadium as \\"The House That Kobe Built\\", due to his historic 20-year career with the Lakers. ==EventsMusic=== After his death in 2009, Michael Jackson's memorial service was held at Staples Center. Rapper Nipsey Hussle's memorial service was also held at Staples Center on April 11, 2019. Staples Center also hosted the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2000 and the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. Grammy Awards The annual Grammy Awards ceremony have been held at Staples Center since 2000, with the exception of 2003 and 2018. As of 2020, the venue has hosted the Grammy Awards nineteen times, hosting more than any other venue in the history of the Grammy Awards. ===Sports=== The venue opened in 1999 as the home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers (NBA), and Los Angeles Kings of the NHL.

Initial fan reaction was positive, and has been a fixture on home games since. The Daktronics see-through shot-clock was first installed prior to the 2008–09 NBA season. The Clippers adopted the new see through shot clock prior to the 2010–11 NBA season.

The present-day theatre is the sixth on the site since 1683. It consists of two performance spaces: a 1,500-seat main auditorium and the Lilian Baylis Studio, with extensive rehearsal rooms and technical facilities also housed within the site. Sadler's Wells is renowned as one of the world's leading dance venues. As well as a stage for visiting companies, the theatre is also a producing house, with a number of associated artists and companies that produce original works for the theatre. Sadler's Wells is also responsible for the management of the Peacock Theatre in the West End, during times not used by the London School of Economics. ==HistoryFirst theatre and pleasure gardens=== Sadler's Wells, 1745 (Robert Chambers, p.73, 1832) Richard Sadler opened a \\"Musick House\\" in 1683, the second public theatre newly opened in London after the Restoration, the first being the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.Sadler's Wells and Drury Lane were newly opened theatres; but some theatres from before the 1642 ban on plays continued operation into the Restoration periods: for example, see the Red Bull Theatre, the Cockpit Theatre, the Salisbury Court Theatre The first entertainments we see at this new building are vocal and instrumental concerts. The name Sadler's Wells originates from his name and the rediscovery of monastic springs,Chambers, R.L., \\"London's Lost Tea- Gardens\\", Book of Days, 1863 which previously served St John's Priory Clerkenwell,Ackroyd, P. (2012). London Under. London: Vintage Books. on his property. This storied part of Sadler's career began around 1683 when two men were digging on his property after being advised to move gravel for the construction of a garden. They eventually struck something that they assumed to be buried treasure, but turned out to be a well. The iron-rich water was thought to provide health benefits. As such, Sadler claimed that drinking the water from the wells would be effective against \\"dropsy, jaundice, scurvy, green sickness and other distempers to which females are liable—ulcers, fits of the mother, virgin's fever and hypochondriacal distemper.\\"Quoted in Sadler's Wells: Complete history In 1698 Thomas Guidott, a doctor of physick who popularised the waters of Bath, wrote what he called \\"A true and exact account of Sadlers Well, or, The new mineral-waters lately found out at Islington treating of its nature and virtues: together with an enumeration of the chiefest diseases which it is good for, and against which it may be used, and the manner and order of taking of it.\\" In modern times the theatre continued to serve the chalybeate water and use it for air conditioning. This brought the health-giving properties of the mineral waters to national attention and an aristocratic clientele was soon attracted from round the country. Thus, this still quite rural location became famous for both water and for music, but as more wells were dug and the exclusiveness of Sadler's Wells declined, so did the quality of the entertainment provided—along with the quality of the clientele who were described as \\"vermin trained up to the gallows\\" by a contemporary, while, by 1711, Sadler's Wells was characterised as \\"a nursery of debauchery.\\" By the mid-18th century, the existence of two \\"Theatres Royal\\"—in Covent Garden and Drury Lane—severely limited the ability of other London theatres to perform any drama combined with music, and Sadler's Wells continued its downward spiral. ===Second and third theatres=== Since the Theatres Royal confined themselves to operating during the autumn and winter, Sadler's Wells filled the gap in the entertainment market with its summer season, traditionally launched on Easter Monday. Thomas Rosoman, manager from 1746 to 1771, established the Wells's pedigree for opera production and oversaw the construction of a new stone theatre, in just seven weeks—at a cost of £4,225; it opened in April 1765. Charles Dibdin, a shareholder and manager of Sadler's Wells, took the regular nineteenth century styled proscenium theatre space and turned it into something new that audiences would flock to. The entirety of the stage was replaced with a permanent tank filled with water, and a second tank located on the roof that created a waterfall trickling down the backdrop of scenes when needed. Designer Thomas King carefully planned and installed a water tank that covered the entirety of the stage. Due to the close proximity to the New River, water was pumped into the venue's tank using an Archimedes wheel. Traditionally used to move water from low lying areas to higher lying areas for irrigation, it seemed to be a perfect solution to transport the water from the river to the stage tank. This technology was made effective by the use of a hand crank and tremendous physical strength. Typically a crew of 12 to 14 men worked for about a half day to fill the tank. Although regularly filled and drained, the tanks required constant maintenance and were often filthy. More often than not, audience members were seen jumping off the balconies and into the water in order to confirm the water was real. Some aquatic drama venues featured large waterfalls, pulling water from the tank and circulating it back in order to create the appearance of cascading water of the first records of a water tank used in entertainment venues was recorded in 1794. Each theatre company produced about three substantial shows per season. Derek Forbes highlighted the use of \\"water-boys\\" that were tasked with executing scenery switches, operating large props such as chariots and battleships, and controlled the operation of the waterfall, making waves when necessary. In the latter half of the 18th century the theatre presented a wide variety of productions. There were patriotic plays and pageants such as \\"A Fig For The French\\", which was produced to boost national morale after a heavy British defeat in a sea battle off Grenada at the hands of the French and Spanish fleets. A stirring spectacle reflecting the Fall of the Bastille won from the previously hostile Public Advertiser newspaper the enthusiastic review: \\"...finer scenes of greater effect have not been produced at any Theatre for many years\\". A performance at Sadler's Wells, circa 1808. The community loved experiencing live interpretations of the battles they have been hearing news about. To produce the spectacle, ships were built exactly to scale of an inch to a foot in comparison to the Naval ships in the war. The precise detail work used in producing the set pieces was so pristine that they had the exact rigging systems and mechanisms that the ships in battle had. Craftsman that made the original ships were brought in throughout the process. Over 115 ships were on stage with guns, canons, and children actors. (King) During the early years of the 19th century, many famous actors appeared at the theatre, including Edmund Kean, as well as popular comedians such as Joseph Grimaldi who for all his gifts as a dramatic actor, is best remembered as the creator of \\"Joey the Clown\\" complete with the rouge half-moons on either cheek. However, the period was characterised by much public drunkenness and loutish behaviour, and the rural location prompted the management to provide escorts for patrons after dark to conduct them into central London. With the construction of a large tank, flooded from the nearby New River, an Aquatic Theatre was used to stage extravagant naval melodramas, such as The Siege of Gibraltar. Special effects like burning volcanoes and fireworks were often used on stage because they reflected well off the water's glossy surface. Sea creatures were often a focal point and excited rowdy audiences who were seeking a show where they could let loose and enjoy a few beers in the process. These shows were extremely popular until they started to decline around 1818 due to the rising popularity of pony races. For around 25 years, these aqueous spectacles served as a leading form of theatre performance that offered a unique opportunity to see the sea in 19th Century London. The theatre also presented successful adaptations of popular novels of the time, such as A Christmas Carol and The Old Curiosity Shop, which ran during January 1841.Victorian Theatres in London accessed 12 February 2007 Just as Sadler's Wells seemed at its lowest ebb, an unexpected champion arrived in the shape of the actor-manager Samuel Phelps. His advent coincided with the passing of the Theatres Act 1843 which broke the duopoly in drama of the Theatres Royal and so Phelps was able to introduce a programme of Shakespeare to the Wells. His productions (from 1844 to 1862), notably of Macbeth (1844), Antony and Cleopatra (1849) and Pericles (1854), were much admired. The well-known actress Isabella Glyn made her first notable appearance as Lady Macbeth on this stage. Phelps was followed between 1863 and 1869 by lessee Robert Edgar and his wife, actress Alice Marriott, who continued the same programme alongside contemporary plays.Sadlers Wells theatre archive: Miss Marriott the female Hamlet, by Carys Lewis, 17 November 2011 In 1870 the lessee and manager was the actor William Henry Pennington, a former soldier.Roy Dutton, Forgotten Heroes: The Charge of the Light Brigade, InfoDial Ltd, (2007) - Google Books pg. 180 In latter part of the 19th century the pendulum swung back to melodrama by the 1860s. This period of the theatre's history is affectionately depicted in Pinero's play Trelawny of the 'Wells' (1898), which portrays Sadler's Wells as outmoded by the new fashion for realism. The era of aqua drama ended as fast as it seemingly began as audience members began to move onto new fascinating ideas for entertainment. This shift can possibly be attributed to the fact that scenery and props were routinely being reused which seemed to bore the audience, but it is also thought that contributions of the war took away from the stories that this type of melodrama told. At the beginning of this change in time, these full- length plays were considered to be a real-life example of combat which was an interesting cultural experience for unaffiliated audience members, yet as the war continued, audience members became more sensitive towards the topic and often shied away from it. Although typically meant to be serious, some plays were wrongly interpreted as poking fun and overly dramatising the war therefore being insensitive towards those who were actually fighting. Even though it is unclear when these aquatic performances ended, there is evidence that one of the final uses of these massive water tanks took place in 1824. Shortly after that, no further records of the famed genre exist. By 1875, plans to turn it into a bath house were proposed and, for a while, the new craze of roller skating was catered to, as the theatre was converted into a roller-skating rink and later a prize fight arena. The theatre was condemned as a dangerous structure in 1878. ===Fourth theatre=== Sadler's Wells in 1879 After re-opening as a theatre in 1879, it became a music hall and featured performers including Marie Lloyd and Harry Champion. Roy Redgrave, founder of the theatrical dynasty also appeared there. Alice Marriott returned to manage the theatre from 1881 to around 1889. In 1896, the theatre was converted into a cinema. Patrons were amazed by the moving pictures of the Theatregraph with film of Persimmon winning The Derby and a saucy vignette entitled \\"The Soldier and His Sweetheart Spooning on a Seat\\". After a succession of managements in the 20th century, the theatre became increasingly run-down and closed in 1915. ===Fifth theatre=== Lilian Baylis, creator of the fifth Sadler's Wells theatre By 1925 the proprietor of the Old Vic theatre, Lilian Baylis felt that her opera and drama productions needed to expand. In that year. she invited the Duke of Devonshire to make a public appeal for funds to set up a charitable foundation to buy Sadler's Wells for the nation. The appeal committee included such diverse and influential figures as Winston Churchill, Stanley Baldwin, G. K. Chesterton, John Galsworthy, Dame Ethel Smyth and Sir Thomas Beecham. It was not long before enough money had been amassed to buy the freehold. Also in 1925, Baylis began collaborating with the ballet teacher Ninette de Valois, a former dancer with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. At the time, de Valois was teaching in her own dance school, the Academy of Choreographic Art, but had contacted Baylis with a proposal to form a repertory ballet company and school. So in 1931 when Sadler's Wells was reopened, de Valois was allocated rehearsal rooms in the theatre and established the Sadler's Wells Ballet School and the Vic-Wells Ballet. The ballet company performed at both the Sadler's Wells and Old Vic theatres. The company grew as the school trained new dancers to join the company. The first principal dancers of the Vic-Wells ballet were Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin and the founder choreographer was Frederick Ashton, all three having been working with the Ballet Club of Marie Rambert. Designed by F.G.M. Chancellor of Matcham & Co, the new theatre opened on 6 January 1931 with a production of Twelfth Night and a cast headed by Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch and John Gielgud as Malvolio. At the beginning of Baylis's management of Sadler's Wells, it was intended that the two theatres should each offer alternating programmes of drama and opera. This happened for a short while, but it soon became clear that it was not only impractical, but also made dubious commercial sense: drama flourished at the Old Vic but lagged behind opera and dance in popularity at the Wells. The Vic- Wells Opera Company was the name of the opera company performing at Sadler's Wells. By 1933/34 season the drama company under Tyrone Guthrie included a range of acting talent including Charles Laughton, Peggy Ashcroft, Flora Robson, Athene Seyler, Marius Goring and James Mason. From 1940, while the theatre was closed during the Second World War, the ballet company toured throughout the country, and on its return changed its name to the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Similarly, the opera company toured to return as Sadler's Wells Opera Company, and it reopened the theatre with the premiere of Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes. In 1946, with the re-opening of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, the ballet company was invited to become the resident company there. De Valois decided that a second company was needed to continue ballet performances at Sadler's Wells, and so the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet was formed, with John Field as artistic director. The Sadler's Wells company later relocated to Covent Garden, where it was incorporated into the Royal Ballet's charter in 1956, becoming The Royal Ballet Touring Company. After a number of years as a touring group, it returned to Sadler's Wells in 1976, becoming the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet. In 1987, the Birmingham Hippodrome and Birmingham City Council invited Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet to re-locate to Birmingham. It did so in 1990 and changed its name to Birmingham Royal Ballet. Since the departure of the company, there has not been a resident ballet company at Sadler's Wells. The opera company moved out of Sadler's Wells Theatre to the London Coliseum in 1968 and was later renamed English National Opera. Sadler's Wells Theatre then became a temporary home both for foreign companies and those within the UK looking for a metropolitan shop-window. In addition, Sadler's Wells, strategically near but not in the West End, was seen as the ideal launching pad for artists at the outset of their careers. Throughout the 1970s a rich diversity of attractions appeared at Sadler's Wells, recapturing something of its former eclecticism. Productions ranged from Handel Opera to the Black Theatre of Prague, to the Netherlands Dance Theatre with its controversial nudity. Also appearing during this period were Merce Cunningham, Marcel Marceau, the Kabuki Theatre, the Dance Theatre of Harlem and the Kodo Drummers from Japan. A disadvantage of such a diverse programme was that it prevented the theatre from having a consistent public image. Briefly in the 1980s, the theatre established the New Sadler's Wells Opera company to play Gilbert and Sullivan and other light opera. The company had some success for a few years and made several respected recordings,See, for example, Lamb, Andrew (1984). \\"Recording Review: Kálmán, Countess Maritza and Lehár, The Count of Luxembourg\\", Gramophone, January 1884, p. 74 and then severed its relationship with the theatre around 1986 and became a touring company. It finally went out of business in 1989.\\"Sadler's Wells Opera Disbands\\", The New York Times, 25 February 1989; accessed 16 April 2007 The first performances of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake—which uniquely included an all-male cast of swans—took place in the main house in November 1995, before embarking on a UK tour then playing in the West End. The Lilian Baylis Theatre opened in October 1988 and it appeared that a permanent theatre company might emerge, but this was limited by funding difficulties. In 1994 Ian Albery became chief executive of Sadler's Wells and presided over the planning and eventual rebuilding of the theatre. On 30 June 1996, the last performance was given at the old theatre before the bulldozers moved in. On St. Valentine's Day the following February a more unusual ceremony took place when Albery buried a time capsule under the centre stalls of the new building. ===Sixth theatre=== The current theatre opened on 11 October 1998 with a performance by Rambert Dance Company of Iolanthe with sets designed by Derek Jarman and Laurence Bennett. The £54 million project was one of the first projects to receive funding from the National Lottery—which contributed £42 million. The new design gave a stage which was wider and deeper and able to accommodate much larger companies and productions than the one it replaced. A new layout to the auditorium accommodated more seats. An extension at the side of the building provided a new ticket office and foyers rising to the full height of the theatre, provided easier audience access to all levels and included bars, cafes and exhibition spaces. As well as the 1,500-seat main auditorium, Sadler's Wells also has a base at the Peacock Theatre near the Aldwych in central London. The rebuilt Sadler's Wells retains the Grade II listing applied to the former theatre in 1950.English Heritage listing details accessed 28 April 2007 It also retains access to the remains of the historic wells that still lie beneath the theatre. The architect was Aedas RHWL, the acoustic consultant was Arup Acoustics. Pete Townshend performed there, on 26 February 2000, and recorded the concert, for the Lifehouse Chronicles box set. In 2001, Sadler's Wells joined in collaboration with the Random Dance director Wayne McGregor. The 10th-anniversary piece Nemesis ran until 2001. When Ian Albery retired as chief executive in October 2002 he was succeeded by Jean Luc Choplin, who had recently worked for Disneyland in Paris and Los Angeles and at one time worked with Rudolf Nureyev as a managing director of the Paris Opera Ballet. Although his contract ran until 2007, in January 2004 Choplin announced that he would be taking up a post at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris in 2006 and left shortly afterwards. Under the artistic directorship of Alistair Spalding since 2004, Sadler's Wells has expanded to become a production house as well as a receiving house, hosting performances by visiting companies from the UK and around the world. In 2013, Sadler's Wells Dance House, a book by Sarah Crompton (Arts Editor in Chief of the Daily Telegraph) was published by Oberon Books. It covers the period 2005–2013 in the theatre's history. To reflect this new ethos, in 2005 Spalding announced five associate artists, creating opportunities for them to work alongside each other and other collaborators in developing new work. The original five artists were BalletBoyz Michael Nunn and William Trevitt, Matthew Bourne's New Adventures, Akram Khan, Jonzi D and Wayne McGregor. A further eleven artists were announced, bringing the total of Associates to sixteen: Russell Maliphant (2005), Sylvie Guillem (2006), Jasmin Vardimon (2006), Christopher Wheeldon (2007), Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui (2008), Hofesh Shechter (2008), Michael Hulls (2010), Kate Prince (2010), Nitin Sawhney (2010), Michael Keegan-Dolan (2012) and Crystal Pite (2013).

In March 2009, Sadler's Wells launched the Global Dance Contest—an online competition to find new dance talent from around the world. The competition will run for four years, with a winner receiving a cash prize and the chance to perform at Sadler's Wells Sampled, the taster weekend which each January showcases the huge range of dance to be seen throughout the year at the theatre.

He was the source of some of the apocryphal stories about Washington. The tale of the cherry tree (\\"I cannot tell a lie, I did it with my little hatchet\\") is included in the fifth edition of The Life of Washington (1809 imprint, originally published 1800), a bestseller that depicted Washington's virtues and was intended to provide a morally instructive tale for the youth of the young nation.Buescher, John. \\"[Is the Story of George Washington and the Colt a True Story?]\\" Teachinghistory.org, accessed September 23, 2011. ==Biography== Bel Air Plantation, where Weems and his family moved upon the death of his father- in-law, Col. Jesse Ewell, in 1805 Mason Weems was born on October 11, 1759, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He studied theology in London and was ordained in the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1784. He worked as a minister in Maryland in various capacities from 1784 to 1792. Financial hardship forced Weems to seek additional employment, and he began working as a traveling book agent. Weems married Frances Ewell in 1795 and established a household in Dumfries, Virginia. He had a small bookstore in Dumfries that now houses the Weems–Botts Museum, but he continued to travel extensively, selling books and preaching.Howard, R. W. \\"Mason Locke Weems\\" in American Historians, 1607–1865. Ed. Clyde Norman Wilson. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 30. Detroit: Gale Research, 1984. From Literature Resource Center. Dumfries is not far from Pohick Church, part of Truro Parish, in Lorton, Virginia, where both George Washington and his father Augustine had worshiped in pre-Revolutionary days. Weems would later inflate this Washington connection and promote himself as the former \\"rector of Mount-Vernon parish\\". Other notable works by Weems include Life of General Francis Marion (1805); Life of Benjamin Franklin, with Essays (1817); and Life of William Penn (1819). He was an accomplished violinist. After the death of his father-in-law, Colonel Jessie Ewell (1743-1805), Weems assumed the Ewell family estate, Bel Air, located in Prince William County, Virginia, to partially satisfy debts owed to Weems. In 1808, Weems and his family moved into Bel Air, where he lived until his death. While on travel in Beaufort, South Carolina, Weems died on May 23, 1825 of unspecified causes. He is buried at Bel Air. == Influence and historical reliability == The New York Times has described Weems as one of the \\"early hagiographers\\" of American literature \\"who elevated the Swamp Fox, Francis Marion, into the American pantheon and helped secure a place there for George Washington\\". Weems' name would probably be forgotten today were it not for the tension between the liveliness of his narratives and what Appletons' Cyclopaedia of American Biography (1889) called \\"this charge of a want of veracity [that] is brought against all Weems's writings,\\" adding that \\"it is probable he would have accounted it excusable to tell any good story to the credit of his heroes.\\" The cherry-tree anecdote illustrates this point. Another dubious anecdote found in the Weems biography is that of Washington's prayer during the winter at Valley Forge.The story of throwing a Spanish dollar (or a stone that size) 270 ft (90 m) across the Rappahannock River near the Washington plantation at Ferry Farm does not seem to occur in Weems' biography, but is instead attributed to Washington's step-grandson George Washington Parke Custis. The alleged feat was recapitulated in 1936 by the renowned professional baseball pitcher Walter Johnson. According to the historian James M. McPherson, Weems' biography of George Washington was likely Abraham Lincoln's only exposure to the study of history as a boy. In a lecture given on Lincoln's birthday in 2010 at Washington and Lee University, McPherson explains how Lincoln, as president-elect, had spoken to the Legislature at Trenton, New Jersey near where, on the day after Christmas 1776, the American Revolution had been saved from collapse by Washington's ragged troops. According to McPherson, Lincoln said: \\"I remember all the accounts in Weems' books of the battlefields and struggles for the liberty of the country and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton: the crossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time-- all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single revolutionary event. I recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have been something more than common that those men struggled for.\\" ===The exaltation of Washington=== The exalted esteem in which the founding fathers, and especially George Washington, were held by 19th-century Americans may seem quaintly exaggerated to their 21st- century counterparts, but that Washington was so regarded is undisputed. The acme of this esteem can be seen on the ceiling of the United States Capitol Building in the form of Brumidi's fresco The Apotheosis of Washington. Weems' A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington, was a biography written in this spirit, amplified by the florid, rollicksome style which was Weems' trademark. According to this account, his subject was \\"... Washington, the hero, and the Demigod ...\\" and at a level above that \\"... what he really was, [was] 'the Jupiter Conservator,' the friend and benefactor of men.\\" With this hyperbole, Weems elevated Washington to the Augustan level of the god \\"Jupiter Conservator [Orbis]\\" (that is, \\"Jupiter, Conservator of the Empire\\", later rendered \\"Jupiter, Savior of the World\\"). === Cherry-tree anecdote === 'Parson Weems' Fable', a 1939 painting by Grant Wood, depicting both Weems and his \\"Cherry Tree\\" story. Among the exaggerated or invented anecdotes is that of the cherry tree, attributed by Weems to \\"... an aged lady, who was a distant relative, and, when a girl, spent much of her time in the family ...\\" who referred to young George as \\"cousin\\". It went on to be reprinted in the popular McGuffey Reader used by schoolchildren, making it part of the culture, causing Washington's February 22 birthday to be celebrated with cherry dishes, with the cherry often claimed to be a favorite of his. As early as 1889, in Henry Cabot Lodge's biography of Washington, historians have acknowledged that while there was \\"nothing intrinsically impossible\\" about the story, it and other stories recounted by Weems were \\"on their face hopelessly and ridiculously false.\\" ==Cultural references== In 1911 Lawrence C. Wroth published Parson Weems: A Biographical and Critical Study.Archived online In this he confronts the fact that Weems is best known for the story of the cherry tree (p. 6) and examines the evidence for its likelihood (pp. 65ff). Grant Wood painted the scene under the title \\"Parson Weems' Fable\\" in 1939. It is among his gently ironic depictions of Americana and shows the parson pulling back a curtain rimmed with cherries to show the story.The painting is analysed in depth at Virginia University site Parson Weems appear referenced as Mason Weems in Assassin's Creed III, who is incarcerated at Bridewell Prison and plans to escape with Connor Kenway. ==Notes== ==Sources== * A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General George Washington by Mason Locke Weems (abridged) * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * * Works by Parson Weems at The Online Books Page Category:1759 births Category:1825 deaths Category:People from Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:American male writers Category:19th-century American writers Category:Writers from Maryland Category:People from Dumfries, Virginia ","title":"Mason Locke Weems"},{"id":"516171","text":"Bogrov in 1910. Dmitry Grigoriyevich Bogrov (1887 – 24 September 1911) () was the assassin of the Russian Minister Of The Interior Pyotr Stolypin. Born Mordechai Gershkovich Bogrov () into a family of Jewish merchants in Kiev (Russian Empire), Bogrov, while simultaneously acting as an anarchist revolutionary, had been an agent of the Okhrana secret police since 1906, informing on the activities of Socialist Revolutionaries, Social Democrats and anarchists.Riasanovsky, Nicholas V., and Mark D. Steinberg. A history of Russia. Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 412. On 14 September 1911, Dmitry Bogrov shot the Russian prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, in the Kiev Opera House, in front of Tsar Nicholas II and two of the imperial princesses. Stolypin died four days later. This act was committed ostensibly in order to decapitate a successful and popular conservative reform movement and thus hasten violent revolution. However, it has been alleged that Bogrov was permitted to act at the behest of extreme right-wing elements in the Tsarist secret police who detested Stolypin because of his agrarian reforms and his flair for parliamentary government. (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn extensively investigates and gives full credit to this conjecture in his historical novel August 1914). Bogrov was tried by the district military court. Despite the plea of Stolypin's widow to the court to save Bogrov's life (she said that taking the young man's life would not bring her husband back), Bogrov was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on in the Kiev fortress of Lysa Hora. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1911 deaths Category:People from Kyiv Category:People from Kiev Governorate Category:Ukrainian Jews Category:Ukrainian anarchists Category:Okhrana informants Category:Assassins of heads of government Category:Ukrainian assassins Category:People convicted of murder by Russia Category:Ukrainian people convicted of murder Category:People executed by the Russian Empire Category:Executed Ukrainian people Category:Ukrainian revolutionaries Category:Executed assassins Category:People executed by the Russian Empire by hanging ","title":"Dmitry Bogrov"},{"id":"516172","text":"Willow Creek is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey.

It may have once covered an area of from and was 30 m deep. The Okavango, Upper Zambezi, and Cuando rivers once all emptied into the lake. Its remains are seen in the Makgadikgadi salt pans, one of the largest salt pans in the world. DNA research suggests the lake region is the homeland of Homo sapiens, where they first evolved into a distinct species about 200,000 years ago, and then expanded to other parts of Africa about 70,000 years later. ==Origin and history== Approximately 3 million years ago, strong easterly winds formed long dunes, which ran from east to west across the middle of the Kalahari Desert. During wetter times, these dunes channeled the great rivers of the area, the Okavango, Chobe, and Upper Zambezi, southeastward to join with the Limpopo River and drain into the Indian Ocean. Northern Botswana has a series of deep, underlying fault lines running beneath its sands. These faults are thought to be the southernmost extensions of the same system of parallel fault lines that are pulling away from each other and have formed East Africa's Great Rift Valley. Parts of the courses of both the Linyanti River and Chobe River, mark the line of these faults today. Approximately 2 million years ago, the fault known as the Ovamboland-Kalahari- Zimbabwe axis (which runs from NE to SW from Harare through Bulawayo and ends in the east side of the Kalahari desert) moved in an epeirogenic flexure, and cut off the drainage route into the Limpopo. The blocked outflow allowed for the creation of Lake Makgadikgadi. The great Magwikwe Sand Ridge between Savuti and North Gate probably defined one of its northwestern shorelines. Another is thought to have been the less obvious Gidikwe Sand Ridge lying just to the west of the western border of the present Makgadikgadi National Park. Wave-washed features can be found on several of the Kalahari's higher places in this region. The eastern side of the Ghoha Hills, north of Savuti, is a particularly clear example of this. Round, water-eroded pebbles can also be found. As the millennia passed, the lake filled to capacity. It began to overflow about 20,000 years ago, taking the lowest point in the watershed in the north east as its new outlet. This caused the middle and lower Zambezi Rivers to connect, forming the Victoria Falls. With the water now able to flow out of the basin, Lake Makgadikgadi drained partially and its average level decreased. A drier climatic period followed, which increased evaporation and decreased the flow of the rivers that fed the lake. By about 10,000 years ago the drying of Lake Makgadikgadi was in an advanced stage. Sediment and debris from the Okavango River and windblown sand were gradually filling the lake. The Gumare fault formed and lowered the land. As a result, the water of the Okavango River spread out over a much larger area of land than it previously had, forming the now characteristic fan-shaped inland delta of the Okavango, which further reduced the water that flowed into Lake Makgadikgadi and hastened its demise. In October 2019 a team led by Vanessa Hayes proposed that land around Lake Makgadikgadi was the area where modern humans first evolved. The findings, based on 1,217 samples of mitochondrial DNA, were disputed by Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London, and Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania. ==Ecology== Lake Makgadikgadi is theorised to have been the birthplace of the vast number of cichlids that once swam the Congo River, Zambezi River, Okavango River and Limpopo River—as many as 100 to 400 new species, of which approximately 25 survive today. Alt URL The lake's sheer size may have provided the ancestors of these fish with an extremely wide range of new ecological niches to exploit and thus could have served as the stimulus for the evolution of the new species, which they may have done in record time before the lake drained completely. The theory further says that the new species, after having evolved within the confines of the lake, could have escaped with the lakewater as it drained, and populated the rivers of the region to evolve into the cichlids that exist today. In current times this land is desiccated most of the year and is a seasonal wetland in the rainy summer months. == Legacy == Today the only remains of Lake Makgadikgadi are the Okavango Delta, the Nxai Pan, Lake Ngami, Lake Xau, the Mababe Depression, and the two main Makgadikgadi pans: the Sua Pan and the Nwetwe Pan. The Makgadikgadi Salt Pans are among the largest in the world and are formed from the last remnants of this great lake. The Okavango Delta is a very large, swampy inland delta formed where the Okavango River reaches the former bed of the lake. It is now an endorheic basin in which all the water reaching the basin is ultimately evaporated and transpired. The other south draining rivers that once fed the lake have now all been captured by the Zambezi. ==References == ==External links== * Makgadikgadi Category:Geography of Botswana Category:Makgadikgadi Pan Category:Pleistocene Makgadikgadi Category:Recent African origin of modern humans ","title":"Lake Makgadikgadi"},{"id":"516176","text":"Westward Ho! is a seaside village near Bideford in Devon, England. The A39 road provides access from the towns of Barnstaple, Bideford and Bude. It lies at the south end of Northam Burrows and faces westward into Bideford Bay, opposite Saunton Sands and Braunton Burrows. There is an electoral ward with the same name. The population at the 2011 census was 2,112. ==Name== Road sign marking the entrance to the village Westward Ho! is noted for its unusual place name. The village name comes from the title of Charles Kingsley's novel Westward Ho! (1855), which was set in nearby Bideford. The book was a bestseller, and entrepreneurs saw the opportunity to develop tourism in the area. The Northam Burrows Hotel and Villa Building Company, chaired by Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth, was formed in 1863, and its prospectus stated: The hotel was named the Westward Ho!-tel, and the adjacent villas were also named after the book. As further development took place, the expanding settlement also acquired the name of Westward Ho! Devon History Society, The ochidore and Westward Ho! Westward Ho! History Group: Westward Ho! - The Beginning The exclamation mark is therefore an intentional part of the village's name. It is the only such place name in the British Isles; Saint- Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, Quebec, shares the distinction of having an exclamation mark in its name. ==Development== Holy Trinity Church Development of the village began ten years after the 1855 Kingsley novel was published, in order to satisfy the Victorians' passion for seaside holidays. The United Services College was founded in the village in 1874. Shell middens and a submerged forest that date to the Mesolithic period have been excavated on the shoreline at Westward Ho!. The village has become more residential as holiday camps closed and houses and flats were erected. One former camp was Torville Camp. The two major holiday camps still running are Surfbay Holiday Park and Braddick's Holiday Centre. Taw and Torridge estuaries ==United Services College== The United Services College, a public school for boys aged about thirteen to eighteen, was founded at Westward Ho! in 1874 and had the aim of preparing boys for the army and navy and for the service of the British Empire. It lasted until 1906, when it merged with the Imperial Service College in Berkshire and closed its site at Westward Ho!. Notable old boys included Rudyard Kipling, whose book Stalky & Co. (1899) is based on his time at the College. ==Geography== Westward Ho! is known for its surfing seas and the long expanse of clean sand backed by a pebble ridge and grasslands which extends for about three miles. It has two churches, Westward Ho! Baptist Church and Holy Trinity Church. The seaward part of the village lies within the North Devon Coast, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. ==Geology== The rocks on the coastline of Westward Ho! are of Upper Carboniferous age. The rocks were tilted during the Variscan Orogeny; in the present day they dip at 50–70 degrees north and south. The wave-cut platform is an example of a multi-scale fault system, with the phases of tectonic activity exposed at low tide. ==TransportBus services=== *Stagecoach 21 – The North Devon Wave – Westward Ho! – Northam – Bideford – East the Water – Instow Anstey Way – Fremington – Bickington – Railway Station – Barnstaple Bus Station - Braunton - Ilfracombe * Stagecoach services run right through the day at 30-minute intervals, 2 buses an hour. * Stagecoach 16 runs to Appledore – Northam – Bideford 6 times a week only on Tuesdays and Thursdays 3x per day. *National Express Coaches also serve Westward Ho!. ===Railway=== A railway served Westward Ho! from 1901 to 1917. The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway was a standard gauge railway which ran between these places, but had no connection with the rest of the railway system, though there was a pedestrian ferry link from Appledore to Instow which was connected to the rest of the rail network of Britain.

(Portuguese) – 13 February 1977Robert M. Levine, \\"The Cautionary Tale Of Carolina Maria De Jesus\\" , Latin American Research Review, Volume 29, Number 1, 1992, pp. 55–84.) was a Brazilian outskirts memorialist who lived most of her life as a slum-dweller. She is best known for her diary, published in August 1960 as Quarto de Despejo (lit. Junk Room, English title Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus) after attracting the attention of a Brazilian journalist, which became a bestseller and won international acclaim. The work remains the only document published in English by a Brazilian slum-dweller of that period. De Jesus spent a significant part of her life in the Canindé favela in North São Paulo, supporting herself and three children as a scrap collector. Quarto de despejo did not stop at being an editorial success, it also spawned theatrical plays, musical compositions (some by de Jesus herself), illustrations and sayings, and is a source for both individual and collective artistic creations, especially by other Black women from Brazilian city outskirts. De Jesus lends her name to community preparatory schools, theatre halls, saraus and collective action groups. The 2020 edition of the :pt:Festa Literária das Periferias (Outskirts Literary Festival) was held in honour of de Jesus' memory, on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication. ==BiographyEarly life=== Carolina Maria de Jesus was born in the city of Sacramento, Minas Gerais, then a small rural town. Her parents were illiterate sharecroppers. She was the daughter of a single mother, and her father was married to another woman. For those reasons, she was treated as an outcast as a child and was a victim of child maltreatment. When she reached the age of seven, de Jesus' mother forced her to attend school. Maria Leite Monteiro de Barros, a wealthy landowner's wife who was also a benefactor to other poor Black neighbourhood children, supported her for a while and paid for her schooling. Her formal education lasted a meagre two years, though by then she was already able to read and write. As her mother had illegitimate children, her family was excluded from Catholic Church. Nevertheless, she never stopped considering herself a Catholic. For instance, she often made biblical references and praises to God in her diary: \\"I dreamt I was an angel. My dress was billowing and had long pink sleeves. I went from earth to heaven. I put stars in my hands and played with them. I talked to the stars. They put on a show in my honor. They danced around me and made a luminous path. When I woke up I thought: I’m so poor. I can't afford to go to a play so God sends me these dreams for my aching soul. To the God who protects me, I send my thanks.\\"Quoted in Robert M. Levine and José Carlos Sebe Bom Meihy, The Life and Death of Carolina Maria de Jesús, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1995, p. 50. In 1937, the year her mother died, pregnant de Jesus migrated to the metropolis of São Paulo, which was experiencing a demographic upswing and witnessing the appearance of its first slums. It is reported that authorities in her hometown thought her ability to read meant that she was a practitioner of witchcraft, because it was so unusual for someone like her. In São Paulo, she earned a living by collecting recyclable materials. She would purchase what little food she could afford with the earnings of her hard work. De Jesus made her own shack out of scrap plywood, cans, cardboard, or pretty much anything she could obtain. Among the materials she collected, there would be an occasional journal or notebook, as well as books, which encouraged her to start recording her day-to-day activities and write about life in the favela. It angered her neighbours that she was always writing because they were illiterate and felt uncomfortable at the thought of her writing about them. Her neighbours were jealous of her and tended to treat de Jesus and her children badly. She never considered getting married, on account of having witnessed too much domestic violence in the slums and preferring to remain an independent woman. She had three children, each from a different relationship (at least one of which was with a wealthy white man). Unlike many fellow Black women, de Jesus celebrated her race and was proud of it. To her, her skin and hair looked beautiful. In her diary, she gives details about the daily life of favelados (the inhabitants of favelas), and bluntly describes the political and social facts which impacted their lives. She writes of how poverty and desperation can cause people of elevated moral character to abandon their principles and dishonour themselves to simply feed their families. According to her, favelados would never get the chance to save money, as any extra earnings would immediately be used to pay off debts. ==Publication of her diary== De Jesus' diary was published in August 1960. She had been discovered by journalist Audalio Dantas in April 1958. Dantas was covering the opening of a neighbouring city playground when, immediately after the ribbon-cuttings, a street gang stormed in and claimed the area, chasing the children away. Dantas saw de Jesus standing at the edge of the playground shouting, \\"Leave, or I'll put you in my book!\\" The intruders departed. Dantas asked what she meant by \\"book\\"; she was shy at first, but took him to her shack and showed him everything she had written. He asked her for a small sample and subsequently ran it in the newspaper. However, de Jesus is known to have given interviews and made other newspaper appearances since the early 1940s. The inspiration for the book's title came from de Jesus' believing the favela was society's junk room: 'I live in the junk room. And whatever's in there, people either set on fire, or throw in the garbage'. De Jesus's story \\"electrified the town\\" and in 1960, Quarto de Despejo came out. It sold 30,000 copies of the first edition and 100,000 copies of the second and third editions. Another source says 80,000 copies all told. Though written in the simple language of a favela dweller, the book was translated into thirteen (another source says fourteen) languages and became a bestseller in North America and Europe. It was published in the United States and UK as Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus in 1962. The book was heavily edited by Dantas, and some critics suspected it a fraud; but the original manuscript was preserved and reprinted in full in 1999, proving not only that de Jesus wrote the book herself, but that she was a much livelier and more poetic writer than Dantas' edition seemed to suggest. Carolina Maria de Jesus, 1960. The book's status as a bestseller came as a surprise to her neighbourhood as well as the country. Many of de Jesus' neighbours knew about her writings before the publication and would tease and ridicule her because of them. \\"Most couldn't even read, but thought she should be doing other things with her spare time than writing and saving old writings.\\" Despite the large amount of publicity and popularity caused by the diary, de Jesus continued to be a social pariah. De Jesus' diary detailed the grim reality of her life as well as that of those around her. She judged her neighbours based on their lifestyles, using actual names and circumstances in the book. \\"You wrote bad things about me, you did worse than I did\\", a drunken neighbour once yelled. Many neighbours despised de Jesus because she seemed to look down on slum people's way of life. One man \\"screamed at her that she was a 'black whore' who had become rich by writing about favelados but refused to share any of her money with them.\\"Levine (1995), p. 52. In addition to their cruel words, people would throw stones and full chamber pots at her and her children. They were also angry because she used the proceeds of her diary to move into a brick-house in the high-end neighbourhood of Santana. \\"Neighbors swarmed around the truck and wouldn't let her leave. 'You think you are high class now, don't you'\\", they would scream. They despised her for what they saw as a disparagement of their way of life, even though a major achievement of her diary was to increase awareness about Brazilian favelas the world over. Seeing as de Jesus raised concerns about conditions in the favelas, local politicians started wanting to meet with her to discuss possible ways to amend the situation. São Paulo's governor Francisco Prestes Maia made a move to engage state agencies in providing poverty relief for favelados. Most of his projects were concerned with teaching women to sew, care properly for their children and practice good hygiene. However, these initiatives quickly faded. ==Children== De Jesus' had three children: Vera Eunice, José (aka Zé) Carlos and João José. Through interviews for The Life and Death of Maria de Jesus (see below ), second eldest Zé and daughter Vera provide vital information about her personality. In her interview, Vera clearly describes how her mother devoted herself entirely to her dream of becoming a writer, without any help from others. Vera admired her mother's aspiration to create a better life not only for herself but for her children. Although living with de Jesus' could be challenging, Vera stated \\"There is no one in the world I admire more than her.\\"Levine (1995), p. 96. Vera stresses how the success of her mother's work quickly resulted in the family constantly travelling, attending parties, and living in a large mansion that seemed almost prison-like due to its large size. Constantly praising her mother during the interview, Vera gives full credit to de Jesus for her achievements; according to her, she would never have been able to attend school if it were not for her mother's success. Vera constantly mentions the danger of living in the favela and how, although she and her siblings were born poor, their mother fought for a better life for them. Violence in the favela made it dangerous for Vera and her brothers to be on the streets with her mother, so most of their time was spent idly, sometimes studying, in their shack waiting for her to return. De Jesus rarely let her children leave their shack, fearing for their safety. Leaving her children alone at night was too dangerous. Vera states: \\"We didn’t have enough money to buy proper food, but my mother wanted us to stay out of the favela! She disliked not only the favela, but the people who lived in it... my mother gave [my brothers] money to stay away the whole day. They only returned at night, to sleep. Movie tickets ended up costing much of our money for food, but she preferred it that way. She preferred to leave at dawn, with her sack on her shoulders, to walk, walk, walk and to go to bed hungry, rather than to leave us alone in Canindé.\\"Levine (1995), p. 101. \\"Hunger is the world plague of the favela\\", Vera stated.Levine (1995), p. 97. Vera made it clear that there was constantly a man in her mother's life. In her words, de Jesus loved being infatuated and was very sexually-oriented. She stressed how her mother did not fancy the Black men of the favela and how they did not favour her too much either. While she had been called a witch in her hometown, in Canindé she was regarded merely as an eccentric. People there were less in awe of her writing than intimidated by it: \\"In the favela, they thought that she was crazy, walking with her notebook under her arm. There were people who laughed. The worst ones laughed at her piles of paper, but they stopped when they realized that it was neither a joke nor craziness\\".Levine (1995), p. 103. When someone upset her, she threatened to write about them in her book. Jealousy of her writing, men, and lifestyle resulted in other faveladas (the female inhabitants of favelas) antagonising her. However, that did not stop de Jesus from continuing to write about what was going on in the favela. During the interview, Vera recalls an event specifically showing her mother's love and protection towards her children. She recalled a childhood event in which she was playing on the grass when a man approached her and asked her to help him find something. The two headed down towards a river and soon the man began removing Vera's clothes in an indication that he was about to rape her. De Jesus instinctively felt her daughter was in danger, and soon made her way down to the river, thereby rescuing her daughter and chasing the stranger away. According to Vera, before the publication of Quarto de despejo her mother became obsessed with Audálio Dantas, her publisher, and was constantly anxious about him sending word about her diary. Soon after the book was released, Vera found herself attending her mother's book signings, wearing new clothes, and travelling across Brazil. All of a sudden, everything Vera, her brothers, and her mother wanted was at their fingertips. Vera said her mother always liked to be the centre of attention, and aspired to become a singer and an actress. In spite of her ambitions, her publisher argued that this would bring her no benefit and insisted she should continue writing books. Soon after the family switched neighbourhoods from the favela to Santana the children started learning about discrimination. There, the family lived in a large brick-house that resembled a prison due to its being large in size. Neighbourhood kids were not allowed to play with Vera and her brothers as their families considered de Jesus was \\"marked by the favela\\".Levine (1995), p. 107. This was a shock to Vera and her brothers because they had been used to playing outside, whereas in Santana they had to stay indoors and could not interact with other children. Despite her mother's fame and fortune, Vera noticed de Jesus was becoming impatient due to her lack of privacy. Before the fame, all de Jesus wanted was to have her writing noticed, but she had started regretting her decisions. Now that money was plentiful (it is estimated she made 2,000 cruzeiros by selling her author's rights, as compared to a 20 cruzeiros income from collecting paper), de Jesus began to spend it for no reason. She had intentions of sending both Vera and Zé Carlos to Italy but soon changed her mind and decided to invest in a small ranch in far-flung Parelheiros where she ended up moving with her children. The family was excited about living in a rural area and Vera saw her mother become hard- working again: growing crops, taking care of the household, and tending to her youngest João as his health grew ill. The family was prevented from getting medical help for him from public health services at the time as they did not have a work card, which was required by the social security agency. Eventually, João died of kidney failure only four months after his mother had passed from respiratory failure in 1977. Vera Eunice, who was interviewed in 1994, got married and became a teacher, and at the time of the interview was a nighttime higher education student with plans of becoming an English-language translator. On the other hand, her youngest son Zé Carlos was twice divorced, occasionally homeless and an alcoholic, and purportedly as smart, angry and erratic as his mother. ==Perspective== One of the characteristics differentiating Carolina Maria de Jesus from her neighbours in the Canindé favela was her distinctive perspective on life. Though living among the lowest classes of society, de Jesus had dreams and aspirations not unlike those of any privileged person who enjoyed a comfortable living in Brazil during the mid-1900s. De Jesus believed that her dreams could be realised and, against great odds, many of them were. She stood by a different paradigm than her favelado counterparts, and lived accordingly. At no point in de Jesus's life was she at peace with the fact that she was born into the lower classes. The activities she occupied her spare time with, her decision to avoid the many risks of a vulnerable life as well as her affairs, all indicated that while she was physically in the favela, her mind wandered free. \\"[W]hat set Carolina apart in Canindé was her penchant for spending several hours a day writing\\".Levine (1995), p. 41. In an environment with high illiteracy rates, eloquent writing was a particularly rare accomplishment. She wrote poems, novels and stories. In the early 1940s, de Jesus began taking her work to editors in an attempt to get it published.Levine (1995), p. 42. She persevered until in 1960, Dantas decided to publish her diary. Among the many things de Jesus chose to write about in her diary were the people living around her. She describes herself as being very different from fellow favelados, and claimed that \\"she detested other blacks from her social class\\".Levine (1995), p. 23. While she watched many of the people around her succumb to drugs, alcohol, prostitution, violence, and robbery, she strived to stay loyal to her children and her writing. De Jesus was consistently able to provide for her children by recycling scrap material for money or diving through dumpsters for food and clothing.Levine (1995), p. 40. By saving some of the paper she collected, de Jesus had the material she needed to go on with her writing. De Jesus offers a non-academic perspective on poverty and exclusionary economic expansion in Brazil, which was then rarely made by someone who did not come form the educated classes. The moment is particularly ironic, as it was a time when Brasilia, the symbol of a 'New Brasil', had just been inaugurated. Another atypical part of de Jesus' life concerned romantic affairs. Although it was not unusual for Black women at the time to seek light-skinned partners, since lighter skin was openly associated with higher economic status, de Jesus did not want to leverage relationships in order to improve her own situation. Her children were fathered by white foreigners from Italy, Portugal, and the United States.Levine (1995), p. 37–39. A few romantic partners offered to marry her, yet she accepted none of their proposals, even though by marrying them, she would have been lifted out of poverty. A possible explanation for that may be that she did not want anyone dictating how she lived. Regardless of the reason, de Jesus remained true to her beliefs and did not conform to the way of life of the favela. ==Global impact== De Jesus wrote another four books after Quarto de despejo, to a scanty success. She rose to fame and fell from grace very rapidly. This could be because of her strong personality, which kept her from getting along with people very well. Also, the Brazilian political landscape changed drastically after the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, which left little room for freedom of expression. She still wrote poems, short stories, and brief memoirs, none of which were ever published. In fact, her obituary in a 1977 edition of the Jornal do Brasil speaks of her blaming herself for not being able to take advantage of her brief celebrity status and states that her stubbornness led her to die in poverty. Still, her biography and memoirs provide insight into Brazilian favela life. While her life story can be seen as a struggle with tragedy, it is possible to regard her views as common Brazilian attitudes towards society, family life, equality, poverty, and other aspects of daily existence in the 1960s. Her book was read extensively both in capitalist areas such as Western Europe and the United States, as well as in the Eastern bloc and Cuba, the wide range of the audience demonstrating how many people were affected by her story outside of Brazil. For the liberal capitalist West, the book portrayed a cruel and corrupt system which had been reinforced by centuries of colonial ideals instilled in people. By contrast, for communist readers the stories depicted perfectly the fundamental flaws of capitalist production in which the worker is the most downtrodden part of the economic system. As Brazilian historian José Carlos Sebe Bom Meihy noted, \\"many foreign specialists in Brazil year after year used her translated diary in their classes\\",Levine (1995), p. 3. which indicates her worldwide role in providing an uncommon first-hand account of 1960s favela life. According to Robert M. Levine, \\"Carolina's words brought alive a slice of Latin American reality rarely acknowledged in traditional textbooks.\\"Levine (1995), p. 7. On 14 March 2019, search engine Google commemorated de Jesus with a Doodle on the 105th anniversary of her birth. ==Bibliography== * Quarto de Despejo: Diário de uma favelada (1960).

He was a graduate of the Pratt Institute, where he majored in Art. He started his first career work in 1930 at Fleischer Studio. At Fleischer he worked on Betty Boop, Raggedy Ann, Gulliver's Travels, the animated adaptations of Superman, and Popeye. He was head animator on two Academy Award-nominated shorts, Educated Fish (1937) and Hunky and Spunky (1939). Waldman made the transition when Fleischer Studios was foreclosed on by Paramount Pictures and reorganized as Famous Studios in 1942. At Famous he worked mostly on the Casper the Friendly Ghost series. In 1958 he left Famous to become an animation director at Hal Seeger Productions where he worked on the revival of the Out of the Inkwell series, as well as Milton the Monster, until his retirement in 1968. Outside of animation, Waldman partnered with writer Steve Carlin in 1940 to produce the Happy the Humbug comic strip. He also created one of the first graphic novels, the wordless novel Eve: A Pictorial Love Story (1943). In 1986 Waldman received the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Award, and in 1997 was given the Winsor McCay Award for his lifetime work in the field of animation. ==Death== Waldman died of congestive heart failure on February 4, 2006, at the age of 97 in Bethpage, New York. == Partial filmography (animator) == * 1985: See & Sing: Christmas Favorites * 1985: See & Sing: Songs of America * 1985: See & Sing: Silly Songs * 1985: See & Sing: All-Time Favorites * 1953: Spook No Evil * 1952: Spunky Skunky * 1949: Toys Will Be Toys * 1949: A Haunting We Will Go * 1943: The Mummy Strikes * 1942: Japoteurs * 1942: Billion Dollar Limited * 1942: The Magnetic Telescope * 1941: Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy * 1940: Ants in the Plants * 1939: Rhythm on the Reservation * 1939: The Barnyard Brat * 1938: Riding the Rails * 1938: The Playful Polar Bears * 1937: Educated Fish * 1936: Betty Boop and the Little King * 1935: Betty Boop with Henry, the Funniest Living American * 1934: Betty Boop's Trial * 1934: Betty Boop's Little Pal * 1934: Betty Boop's Prize Show * 1933: Betty Boop's Birthday Party * 1933: Betty Boop's Hallowe'en Party ==ReferencesWorks cited=== * * * Artist: Myron Waldman at the Barker Animation Art Gallery.

Carroll School of Management). ==History== When World War II ended in 1945 there was a dramatic increase in enrollment at Boston College, due to the returning soldiers and the opportunities afforded to them by the G.I. Bill. The number of undergraduates swelled from 1,000 before the war to 5,000 by 1946. The available facilities could no longer accommodate any more students, so Boston College decided to build Fulton Hall. This building was, by far, the most sparse due to budget constraints. Students went door to door throughout the city of Boston selling “Bricks for Boston College” for $1 each in an attempt to raise funds. Working with whatever resources they could, Maginnis & Walsh designed a building that would never be able to live up to the rest of the existing buildings. The construction of Fulton Hall began in June 1947 and ended in 1948. The building was laid out on the south side of what is now known as the main quad. This area is composed of a large grassy courtyard surrounded by the Lyons, Gasson, Devlin, and Fulton buildings, one in each cardinal direction. The original design consisted of a simple 2-story Gothic- style building with a plain masonry façade, two towers in the front corners and a recessed courtyard on the south side. Because of its hilly location, and a request from the Trustees of Boston College that the building not block the view of Gasson Hall, only the top two stories were visible from the front of the building and the Gasson quadrangle, making it look small amongst the taller adjacent buildings. ==Architectural description and renovation== In the summer of 1993, Svigals & Associates radically renovated the exterior with the same polychrome masonry work as the rest of the building, but its interior is drastically different. and reduces the industrial feel of the exposed structural members. The contrast of a warm and soft material like wood and a cold and stiff one like metal creates a very interesting effect, where the softer warmer material gives the building a finished, refined and elegant look while the steel makes it feel modern, strong and minimalist. The large glass ceiling of the atrium allows large amounts of light to flow into the building throughout the day because of its east to west layout. This light is softened by the use of diffusing finishes on all of the interior surfaces, creating a naturally lit environment where it is nearly impossible to identify the source of light. All exposed wood has an eggshell finish that diffuses the light, as the masonry walls of the original building naturally do. To use the atrium's natural light and provide a sense of openness, the third, fourth, and fifth- floor north-facing walls (that face the atrium) on the rear section feature large windows. The second floor has a U-shaped balcony area that overlooks the open area in first floor, which is furnished with couches benches and tables and meant to be a meeting place and lounge area for students. The balcony, which connects the old building to the new one, features steel and wood handrails composed of steel vertical elements and wood horizontal elements that provide a softer and warmer material for human interaction. The handrails also feature gothic arches that span from column to column, and represent the union of the classic gothic building and the new, modern addition. Because of lack of funds when it was constructed, the original Fulton Hall was a short, plain stone building. Many felt it looked out of place amongst the other much more ostentatious and taller colored-stone buildings. For many years, many regarded it as the most unsuccessful of the Maginnis & Walsh buildings. It went through many minor renovations, including construction of a small Library on the south side of the building overlooking the courtyard. This small library now overlooks the atrium. This wall features seven evenly spaced windows in the form of large Gothic arches, each of which is divided into three columns, each featuring a drop-shaped subdivision near the top for decoration. A lead rectangular grid pattern applied to large panels of glass creates the effect of the window being composed of small panes. This is a sharp contrast from the windows in the new addition, which are rectangular and feature large uninterrupted glass panes. ==References== Category:Boston College ","title":"Fulton Hall"},{"id":"516202","text":"The Prime Minister of Dominica is the head of government in the Commonwealth of Dominica.

A. L. Diamond (born Ițec (Itzek) Domnici; June 27, 1920 – April 21, 1988) was a Moldovan-born American writer of comedy and drama in Hollywood from the 1940s through the 1980s. As Billy Wilder's second writing partner, after Charles Brackett, he wrote twelve screenplays with Wilder. ==Early life== Diamond was born in Ungheni, Iaşi County, Bessarabia, Romania, present day Moldova, was referred to as \\"Iz\\" in Hollywood, and was known to quip that his initials stood for \\"Interscholastic Algebra League\\", a prize he had won while attending Boys' High School in Brooklyn. Diamond emigrated with his mother and sister, following his father to the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn in the United States at the age of 9. There he studied at the Boy's High School, showing ability in mathematics, competing in the state Mathematics Olympiads in 1936–37 and winning several medals therein. Diamond completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia in 1941. There he studied journalism, publishing in the Columbia Daily Spectator under the pseudonym \\"I. A. L. Diamond\\". He was editor of the humor magazine Jester of Columbia, a member of the Philolexian Society, and became the only person to single-handedly write four consecutive productions of the annual revue, the Varsity Show as well as a spare should they need one. As a result, upon graduation he abandoned his plans to pursue his master's in engineering at Columbia and accepted a short- term contract in Hollywood. ==Career and later life== A succession of limited- term contracts ensued, notably at Paramount Pictures, where Diamond worked on projects without ultimately receiving a writing credit. He then moved to Universal Pictures, where in 1944 he worked on his first credited feature script, Murder in the Blue Room. It was a year later, at Warner Brothers, that he achieved his first real success and consequent recognition with Never Say Goodbye in 1946. He worked at 20th Century Fox from 1951 to 1955, eventually deciding to become independent. In 1957 he began a collaborative relationship with Billy Wilder on the movie Love in the Afternoon. From there, the pair had a string of hits with Some Like It Hot; The Apartment (which won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay); One, Two, Three; Irma la Douce; the Oscar- nominated The Fortune Cookie; the sex comedy Kiss Me, Stupid; and The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. Diamond also had a hit with his 1969 solo adaptation of the play Cactus Flower into the movie of the same name. In total, Diamond and Wilder wrote twelve movies together over 25 years. Some of these films feature characters engaged in never-ending but friendly squabbling, such as Joe and Jerry in Some Like it Hot and Holmes and Watson in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. Diamond's widow claims that these characters were based on her husband's relationship with Wilder. In 1980, Diamond and Wilder were given the Writers Guild of America's Laurel Award for career achievement in screenwriting. Wilder had previously received the Laurel Award in 1957 for his screenwriting partnership with Charles Brackett. ==Death== Diamond died of multiple myeloma in Beverly Hills, California on April 21, 1988 at the age of 67. ==FilmographyAs writer=== * Buddy Buddy (1981) * Fedora (1978) * The Front Page (1974) * Avanti!

The album was originally conceived as the group's parting shot to its longtime record label, Wax Trax! Records, but it ended up also signaling the break-up of KMFDM itself until the band reformed in 2002. Recorded in Seattle, Washington, this was the last album to feature En Esch and Günter Schulz, who both went on to form Slick Idiot. Following the break-up, founding member Sascha Konietzko created the band MDFMK, before reforming KMFDM in 2002 without Esch or Schulz. The album was released on April 20, 1999, on the same date the Columbine High School massacre took place. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two perpetrators of the massacre, were both avid KMFDM fans. Eric Harris noted the coincidence of the album's title and release date in his journal.\\"heh, get this. KMFDM's new album is entitled \\"Adios\\" and its release date is in April. how fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final \\"Adios\\" tribute to Reb and Vodka. thanks KMFDM... I ripped the hell outa the system\\" -Eric Harris A Columbine Site Retrieved September 17, 2010 A digitally remastered reissue of Adios was released on May 8, 2007, along with Symbols. ==Background== The 1990s core of KMFDM (Sascha Konietzko, En Esch, and Günter Schulz) had reunited for the previous album, Symbols, and toured together along with fellow German industrial metal band Rammstein in 1997. The core line-up was joined on tour by John DeSalvo, Nivek Ogre, and Tim Sköld. Adios was written almost entirely by Konietzko and Sköld, who became an official member for the band's final release with Wax Trax! Records. Schulz, who had done significant writing for the previous five albums, acted only as a studio musician, while Esch helped write only a pair of songs. ==Release date controversy== Adios was released on April 20, 1999, which coincided with the Columbine High School massacre and Adolf Hitler's birthday. Although Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were big fans of the group, KMFDM released an official statement denouncing the violence, sympathizing with the victims and their families, and explaining that the band had no Nazi affiliations whatsoever. ==Reception== Adios received positive reviews. Gina Boldman of Allmusic said of the album: \\"KMFDM sound smoother yet maintain their emotive mayhem in all its glory.\\" The staff of PopMatters called Adios a \\"superb mix of the anarchaic fueled fury of the 80’s and a full awareness of what their genre has become.\\" Remarking on the band's then-disbandment, they further stated that KMFDM \\"left us with something to remember them by.\\" Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report said that Adios \\"continues in the group's grand tradition of techno-informed, industrial-fueled beat manipulation\\".

It aired on PBS from 1980 to 1988, and later ran on Noggin (a joint venture between the CTW and Nickelodeon) from 1999 to 2002. The show teaches scientific principles and their applications. Dr. Edward G. Atkins, who was responsible for much of the scientific content of the show, felt that the TV program would not replace a classroom but would encourage viewers to ask questions about the scientific purpose of things. ==Concept== A frequent segment of the show was The Bloodhound Gang, a series about a group of young detectives who used science to solve crimes. Episodes of the series needed to be run in regular sequence for understandable viewing, as many Bloodhound Gang mysteries were cut among two or three Contact episodes. ==HistoryInitial conception=== 3-2-1 Contact was the brainchild of Samuel Y. Gibbon Jr., who had been the executive producer of the original The Electric Company for the CTW from 1971 to 1977. (Gibbon had left the CTW before Contact's production officially began, though he was still credited as \\"Senior Consultant\\".) The show was based on the original concept of The Curiosity Show, an Australian science-based children's educational TV show that had been running since 1972. That program was hosted by Australian scientists Rob Morrison and Deane Hutton, who were consultants to The Children's Television Workshop in the early planning stages of what became 3-2-1 Contact. CTW wanted to make a version using American scientists as presenters, but PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into 3-2-1 Contact. ===Seasons production=== The first season of 65 programs began airing January 14, 1980, on select PBS member stations; it featured a cast of three college students who socialized and discussed science in an on-campus room known as \\"the workshop\\". This season came to an end on April 11, 1980, and continued in reruns (or removed entirely from scheduling on some stations) for the following three years, as funding for additional episodes was not yet sufficient. When production finally resumed for the second season, which premiered on October 17, 1983, the show presented a more realistic appearance, as the new cast convened in a suburban basement (these segments were shot at Reeves Teletape, which also housed Sesame Street at the time). This cast continued until October 18, 1985. Ozzie Alfonso was Contacts new director and Al Hyslop its executive producer. When the fifth season began on September 22, 1986, a third cast was introduced. However, unlike the previous casts, they did not meet in any specific setting; instead, they appeared in various taped and filmed segments. The show ended after seven seasons and 225 episodes on November 18, 1988. ===International and school versions=== For a time in the mid-1980s, the program was co-produced with the French television network FR3 and featured several new French cast members in addition to the American cast. From 1982 to 1983 the program was aired in Spain with dubbed-over versions of the American original broadcasts, and some local add-ons with four Spanish cast members: Sonia Martínez, Luis Bollain, Fernando Rueda, and Marifé Rodríguez.La Vanguardia, February 12, 1982, April 4, 1983. Another Spanish version of the broadcast was aired from 1990 to 1992. It was reported in 1984 that 3-2-1 Contact had an audience of over 7 million viewers and was broadcast in 26 countries including West Germany, France, Italy, and Spain making their own dubbed-over versions. From September 1, 1991 to May 1, 1992, an edited version titled 3-2-1 Classroom Contact was produced, specifically for in- school viewing. It was hosted by either Stephanie Yu, Z. Wright, or both and used previously aired segments from the past series. Broadcasters wanted children and schools to record and replay the episodes without being afraid of infringement of copyright violations. ==Hosts== * Liz Moses as Lisa (1980) * Leon W.

In 1985, the magazine absorbed some of the content of sibling publication Enter (which went out of print that same year), including reader submissions of computer programs written in the BASIC computer language as well as reviews of popular computer programs. The Enter section also contained a new feature called \\"The Slipped Disk Show,\\" in which a fictional disc jockey answered computer-related questions submitted by readers. In 1987, the magazine began featuring content from another CTW production, Square One Television. Such content frequently took the form of a two-page comic strip, often parodying a popular show or movie of the time, with a math-related question at the end. The Bloodhound Gang mysteries also made the leap to the magazine, but they were subsequently replaced with a series entitled The Time Team in September 1990. These stories found teenage characters Sean Nolan and Jenny Lopez traveling to different time periods in the past and future. Their surroundings and personal encounters were described with great detail, educating readers as to the customs of various cultures throughout history, and – on trips to the future – often pushing present day hot-button issues. For example, a 1993 story saw the duo traveling to what appeared to be a prehistoric forest, but near the end, they found a Brazil flag, a newspaper clipping from 1995, and a bulldozer at work: this was in fact a Brazilian rainforest being levelled. In 1996, The Time Team was replaced by a comic serial, Cosmic Crew, which focused on the adventures of a group of teenagers and their robot butler in space. Their first story arc (which ran for more than a year) had them trying to figure out a series of riddles relating to places in the solar system in order to claim a treasure (which turned out to be a scholarship fund). Another story arc had a delinquent (who had been a villain in the first arc) join them in order to chase down a gang of other delinquents. Despite being effectively replaced, a few Time Team stories were run whenever there were gaps between installments of Cosmic Crew. Many of the magazine's cover stories involved current events, such as 1990s oil fires in the Middle East. In addition, the magazine offered a games section in which most of the games were related to the stories in the issue. In 1996, CTW presumably concluded that faithful readers from the late 1980s and early 1990s had long since moved on, and the magazine began to reprint non-time-sensitive stories from years past. For example, a 1991 article on the geography of the Galápagos Islands – a subject relatively unchanging due to the islands' well-enforced ecologically protected status – could very well re-appear in an identical format a half a decade later. Under Children's Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop), the magazine later became Contact Kids, removing the original reference to the television show. Production of the magazine was suspended indefinitely in 2001. ==References* * 3-2-1 Contact fan site on Facebook Category:1980 American television series debuts Category:1988 American television series endings Category:1980s American children's television series Category:1980s American science fiction television series Category:Children's magazines published in the United States Category:PBS original programming Category:Science education television series Category:Television series by Sesame Workshop Category:Television shows filmed in New York (state) ","title":"3-2-1 Contact"},{"id":"516271","text":"The Fish River (Visrivier in Afrikaans, Fischfluss in German) is a river in Namibia.

The Union Nationale, led by former premier Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Adélard Godbout. This was the first Quebec provincial election in which women were allowed to vote, having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1940 and at the federal level in 1919. This election marked Duplessis's comeback after having defeated Godbout in the 1936 election and having lost to him in the 1939 election. Unlike in the 1939 election, when the alcoholic Duplessis was clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies, le chef had benefited from the time he had spent in an American sanatorium in 1942-43, where he had sobered up, and in the 1944 election, Duplessis refrained from drinking. The biggest issue during this election was provincial autonomy. In order to appeal to nationalist voters, Duplessis attacked the incumbent premier, claiming that he was not taking a strong enough stand against Ottawa. He mainly criticized Godbout for agreeing to transfer unemployment insurance from the province to the federal government. He also criticized the Rowell-Sirois Commission for its stance on unemployment insurance and equalization payments. Another reason Duplessis won the election was by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec by making the false claim in a violently anti-Semitic speech that the Dominion government together with the Godbout government had made a secret deal with the \\"International Zionist Brotherhood\\" to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for Jewish campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties.Knowles, Valerie Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006, Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149. By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and if he were elected Premier, he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. To further push on the message, the Union Nationale handed out campaign pamphlets warning about the alleged plan to bring 100,000 Jewish refugees to Quebec, which featured a cartoon of the standard stereotype of an evil-looking, hook- nosed Jew handing bags of money to Godbout while in the background a vast horde of dirty, disreputable-looking, hook-nosed Jewish refugees were ready to descend on la belle province.Abella, Irving & Troper, Harold None is too many: Canada and the Jews of Europe, 1933-1948, Toronto: L & O Denny, 1986 page 162. Through Duplessis's story about the plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely false, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election.Knowles, Valerie Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006, Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149. Duplessis's biographer Conrad Black argued that Duplessis was in no way personally anti-Semitic, but because the majority of Quebecois were at the time, Duplessis had merely used antisemitism to win the 1944 election.Black, Conrad Duplesisis, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1977 page 719 Duplessis won another three elections in a row, for a total of five terms of office (four consecutive), before dying in office in 1959. In this wartime election, Godbout's support for Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in the Conscription Crisis of 1944 may have contributed to his defeat. The Bloc Populaire won four seats on an anti-conscription platform. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (predecessor of the New Democratic Party) won one seat. Party member David Côté was elected to the legislature, but in July 1945, he decided to sit as an independent. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular Vote - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" align=\\"center\\"1939 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change  Maurice Duplessis align=\\"right\\"90 align=\\"right\\"15 !align=\\"right\\"48 align=\\"right\\"+220% align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 38.02% align=\\"right\\"-1.1%  Adélard Godbout align=\\"right\\"91 align=\\"right\\"70 !align=\\"right\\"37 align=\\"right\\"-47.1% align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 39.35% align=\\"right\\"-14.7%  André Laurendeau align=\\"right\\"80 align=\\"right\\"* !align=\\"right\\"4 align=\\"right\\"* align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 14.40% align=\\"right\\"* Co-operative Commonwealth  Romuald-Joseph Lamoureux Maurice Duplessis reprend le pouvoir, Les Archives de Radio-Canada, August 8, 1944 align=\\"right\\"25 align=\\"right\\"0 !align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\"* align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 2.56% align=\\"right\\"* colspan=2Other align=\\"right\\"47 align=\\"right\\"1 !align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 5.67% align=\\"right\\"+3.3% - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"86 !align=\\"right\\"91 !align=\\"right\\"+5.8% !align=\\"right\\" !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"right\\" - } Note: * Information on party's actions in previous election not available. ==Footnotes== ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 22nd Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ","title":"1944 Quebec general election"},{"id":"516278","text":"The 1939 Quebec general election was held on October 25, 1939 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.

This was Godbout's second non- consecutive term of office and his only victory out of four consecutive general elections opposing Duplessis. The Action libérale nationale, which had won 25 seats in the 1935 election and then merged with the Quebec Conservative Party, was re-formed by Paul Gouin, who had split with Duplessis soon after the formation of the Union Nationale. However the ALN obtained only 4.5% of the vote and no seats. It soon disbanded. Also, a rump Conservative Party ran three candidates who won 0.2% of the vote and no seats.

Philip was the second Lord of Livingston Manor, a merchant, and slave trader. ==Early life== Coat of Arms of Philip Livingston Philip Livingston was the fourth child and second son of Robert Livingston and Alida (née Schulyer) van Rensselaer Livingston. He was born on July 9, 1686 in his father's Albany, New York town house, at \\"Elm Tree Corner\\", the intersection of State and Pearl Streets and one of early Albany's principal crossroads. The name commemorates a legendary elm tree that reputedly was planted in 1735 by a young Philip Livingston in front of his father's house on the northwestern corner. Something of an Albany landmark, the old elm was removed in June 1877.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Elm Tree Corner\\", New York State Museum At the time of Philip's birth, his father was downriver in New York engaged in persuading Governor Dongan to grant a city charter to Albany. Philip was named for his maternal grandfather, Philip Pieterse Schuyler. Alida Livingston taught her children to read and write both English and Dutch. Philip spent a year with the Huguenot community of New Rochelle in order to learn French, in anticipation of a career as an Albany trader dealing with French Canada.Kierner, Cynthia A., Traders and Gentlefolk: The Livingstons of New York, 1675-1790, Cornell University Press, 1992 Philip grew up learning the intricacies of business, and trade from his father, the most successful entrepreneur in the Hudson Valley.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Philip Livingston\\", New York State Museum From 1707, he acted as his father's unofficial deputy in the offices of clerk of the county and city of Albany. Philip Livingston is described as \\"a handsome, gay 'breaker of hearts'\\".The WPA Guide to New York, Federal Writers' Project ==CareerMerchant=== His parents relocated to Livingston Manor sometime prior to Philip's marriage Catherine van Brugh in 1708. Philip and his wife took up residence in the Albany townhouse. From there he took over management of his father's Albany enterprises. Philip Livingston began his mercantile career at the age of 23 after an apprenticeship with one of his Schuyler uncles in Albany. Later, he became a mercantile factor in his own right, trading furs with New York merchants such as Stephen DeLancey and Henry Cuyler. With vast land tracts and abundant water resources at their disposal, the Livingstons were well placed to recognize the importance of grain as a commodity New York could export. Robert Livingston built two gristmills on the Manor and Philip Livingston acted as his father’s agent buying grain in the Hudson valley and selling flour in New York or shipping it the British West Indies. His younger brother, Robert, served as his agent in New York City. Early in his career, Philip Livingston surveyed land titles. In late 1719, he was licensed to practice law. In 1720 Philip was appointed one of the Commissioners for Indian Affairs. That same year Robert Livingston resigned the positions of Secretary for the Commission of Indian Affairs, and Town Clerk of Albany in favor of Philip. The appointment was confirmed by Governor Burnet. Livingston, Edwin Brockholst. The Livingstons of Livingston Manor, Knickerbocker Press, 1910 The position of Secretary to the Commission of Indian Affairs Robert put to good advantage in acquiring thousands of acres of unimproved land in the Mohawk Valley. In 1725, Philip was appointed to the Provincial Council, a position he held until his death. Unlike his father, Philip preferred business to politics, and considered himself primarily a merchant. In 1724 he declined a seat in the assembly as he thought attending the legislature would hurt business. Philip Livingston spent a good deal of time in New York city where he owned a townhouse on Broad Street. Livingston also owned ships and participated with his sons in lucrative privateering and Triangular Trade operations. ===Slave trade=== Philip Livingston inherited slaves from both his parents and in-laws. One of Robert Livingston's his earliest investments in 1690 was a half-interest in the Margriet, a vessel that journeyed to Madagascar, Barbados, and Virginia to trade in slaves, sugar, and tobacco. Philip and his sons continued this lucrative trade. Philip traded extensively with the West Indies; in the 1730s and 1740s, he was one of New York's leading importers of slave labor from the sugar islands. Philip formed a company with his sons Philip and Pieter Van Brugh Livingston, called Philip Livingston & Sons, New York. At first the Livingstons imported small numbers of slaves from Antigua and Jamaica.Rawley, James A. and Behrendt, Stephen D., The Transatlantic Slave Trade: A History, University of Nebraska Press, Dec 1, 2005 One of the most notorious open-air markets was along the East River at the end of Wall Street. In August 1733, Philip's sloop Katherine returned with fifty blacks from Jamaica. In 1738, Philip bought a one-third share in a voyage to Guinea, where two hundred slaves were purchased and consigned to his son Peter Van Brugh and his partner in Jamaica. The ships also handled gold and ivory. The ship Oswego out of Jamaica, arrived in New York in August 1741, carrying a consignment of twelve African slaves. Slave ships continued to arrive in port despite the panic caused that summer by a so-called slave insurrection in the city. In 1749, the sloop Rhode Island, owned by the company Philip Livingston & Sons, traded rum, tobacco and cheese for guns, cloth and ivory, which it then traded on the African coast for 124 slaves.Collins, Glenn. \\"The 'Main Event'\\", New York Times, The Arts, Tuesday, September 27, 2005 In 1750 Livingston & Sons had three vessels working the African coast. They also owned shares in the Stork and the Sarah and Elizabeth. When the Wolf docked in New York Harbor in May 1751, 66 slaves had survived the voyage out of 147 boarded. On Livingston Manor tenant farmer, John Dykeman, was murdered in 1715 by his slave, Ben. Coming in the aftermath of the New York Slave Revolt of 1712, it was first thought to be part of another such uprising. But after a preliminary hearing conducted by Robert Livingston, Sr. and some county magistrates, it was determined that the murder was the sole act of a heartbroken, vengeful father: Dykeman had sold Ben's daughter off the manor to one of Livingston's kin in New York City. ===Lord of Livingston Manor=== Robert Livingston, first Lord of the Manor died on October 1, 1728. As Philip's older brother Johannes had died in 1720, Philip succeeded as second Lord of Livingston Manor. He was well prepared, having assisted his father in the management of the estate. He increased the family's real estate holdings and in 1743 establishing the colony's first iron works at Ancram, named for a village in Scotland. Livingston Manor became an integrated agricultural, mercantile and industrial concern. However, business affairs kept him in Albany, where he was clerk of the county and city. In 1737, he was appointed to the commission to set the boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. ==Personal life== In September 1708, Livingston married nineteen-year-old Catherine Van Brugh, the only child of Albany mayor Pieter Van Brugh. Three months later, the first of their eleven children was baptized in the Albany Dutch church.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Catharina Van Brugh Livingston\\", New York State Museum Livingston trained his sons for the mercantile profession, sending them into apprenticeship with merchant friends and correspondents in New York, London and Jamaica. The children were: * Robert Livingston (1708–1790), the 3rd Lord of the Manor who married Maria Thong (1711–1765), a granddaughter of Gov. Rip Van Dam. After her death, he married Gertrude (née Van Rensselaer) Schuyler (b. 1714), daughter of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer. * Pieter Livingston (b. 1710), who died young. * Peter Van Brugh Livingston (1712–1792), who married Mary Alexander (1721–1767), the daughter of James Alexander and Mary Spratt Provoost. * John Livingston (1714–1786), who married Catharine de Peyster (1724–1804), a granddaughter of the Mayor of New York City Abraham de Peyster. * Philip Livingston (1716–1778), a signer of the Declaration of Independence who married Christina Ten Broeck (1718–1801), daughter of Albany Mayor Dirck Ten Broeck. * Hendrick \\"Henry\\" Livingston (1719–1772), who lived and died in the Jamaica, West Indies. * Sara Livingston (1721–1722), who died young. * William Livingston (1723–1790), a signer of the United States Constitution and the first Governor of New Jersey, who married Susannah French (1723–1789) in 1745. * Sarah Livingston (1725–1805), who married William Alexander, Lord Stirling (1726–1783), in 1748. * Alida Livingston (1728–1790), who married Henry Hansen (d. 1758). After his death, she married Martinus Hoffman (1706–1772), a member of the Hoffman family and the father-in-law of New York State Senator Isaac Roosevelt. * Catherine Livingston (1733–1807), who married Alderman John Lawrence (1721–1764) of New York in 1759. After his early death, Catherine, who did not have children, never remarried. Philip Livingston died in New York on February 11, 1749. His body was transported upriver and buried at Livingston Memorial Church and Burial Ground in Livingston Manor. ===Philanthropy=== He donated 28 pounds sterling to Yale College in 1745 \\"as a small acknowledgement of the sense I have for the favour and Education my sons have had there.\\" The donation was used in 1756 by President Thomas Clap to establish the Livingstonian Professorship of Divinity. The Livingston Gateway at Yale stands in his honor. ==See also== *Livingston family ==References== ==External links== *Wilder, Craig Steven.

The company is owned by UK Government Investments. ==History== Post Office branches, along with the Royal Mail delivery service, were formerly part of the General Post Office and after 1969, the Post Office corporation. Post Office Counters Ltd was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Post Office corporation in 1986. After the Post Office statutory corporation was changed to a public company, Royal Mail Group, in 2001, Post Office Counters Ltd became Post Office Ltd. Post Office Ltd has in recent years announced losses; a reported £102 million in 2006. This has raised many concerns in the media regarding Post Office Ltd's ability as a company to operate efficiently., The Times article analysing Post Office losses. Plans to cut the £150m-a-year subsidy for rural post offices led to the announcement that 2,500 local post offices were to be closed. This announcement resulted in a backlash from local communities that relied on the service. A branch of WHSmith in Hounslow, incorporating a post office In 2007, the government gave a £1.7 billion subsidy to Royal Mail Group so that it could turn a profit by 2011. This was to be used to invest across the whole network of Royal Mail, Post Office Ltd and Parcelforce. 85 Crown post offices were closed, 70 of which were sold to WHSmith. This followed a trial of six Post Office outlets in WHSmith stores. WHSmith was expected to make up to £2.5 million extra in annual profit. 2,500 sub-post offices closed between 2008 and 2009. Redundancy packages were provided from public funding (subpostmasters were paid over 20 months salary, roughly £65,000 each). In November 2010, the government committed £1.34 billion of funding up to 2015 to Post Office Ltd to enable it to modernise the Post Office network. As part of the Postal Services Act 2011, Post Office Ltd became independent of Royal Mail Group on 1 April 2012. A ten-year inter- business agreement was signed between the two companies to allow post offices to continue issuing stamps and handling letters and parcels for Royal Mail. The Act also contained the option for Post Office Ltd to become a mutual organisation in the future.Building a Mutual Post Office Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (retrieved 8 December 2012) On 8 February 2013, Post Office Ltd announced it was planning to move around seventy of its Crown post offices into shops. This would reduce the Crown network, which it stated was losing £40 million a year, to around 300. On 27 November 2013, the government committed an additional £640 million of funding for 2015 to 2018 to allow Post Office Ltd to complete its network modernisation. In April 2016, the Post Office agreed to hand over up to 61 more branches to WHSmith in a 10-year deal. The deal was condemned as \\"blatant back-door privatisation\\" by the Communications Workers Union. ==Services== Central Post Office in Oxford, Oxfordshire Central Post Office in Otley, West Yorkshire There are currently around 11,500 post office branches across the UK, of which 300 are directly managed by Post Office Ltd (known as Crown offices). The majority of other branches are either run by various franchise partners or local subpostmaster or operators (who may be members of the National Federation of SubPostmasters or the CWU Postmasters Branch), as \\"sub-postoffices\\". The Post Office has a wide variety of services throughout the network of branches. Products and services available vary throughout the network; main post offices generally provide the full range of services. The Post Office rolled out the 'ParcelShop' scheme in Summer 2019, allowing retail stores to accept Royal Mail internet returns, in order to expand Post Office facilities. In towns, post offices are usually open from around 09:00 to 17:30 from Monday to Friday and from 09:00 to 12:30 on Saturday. In some country areas, opening hours are much shorter—perhaps only four hours per week. In some villages an outreach service is provided in village halls or shops. There are also \\"mobile post offices\\" using converted vans which travel between rural areas. Many post offices are shut on Sundays and Bank Holidays. Some in smaller towns or villages are shut at lunchtime. ===Postal services=== Interior of a post office, showing available merchandise The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail. Post Office Local Collect is a scheme whereby undelivered mail can be redirected at customer request to a post office for convenient collection. Poste restante mail can also be held for collection by people travelling. ===Financial services=== The Post Office provides credit cards, current accounts, insurance products, mortgages and personal loans through the Post Office Money umbrella brand which was launched in 2015. Most Post Office Money branded products are provided by Bank of Ireland (UK) plc with Post Office Ltd acting as an appointed representative and credit broker. However, with the sale of the Bank of Ireland's UK assets to Jaja Finance in 2019,https://www.uk.reuters.com/article/uk-boig-sale-credit-cards/bank-of- ireland-sells-uk-credit-cards-for-530-million-idUKKCN1TT0T3 Post Office branded Credit Cards are now issued by Capital One UK. ===Branch banking=== A mobile post office in Borrowby, North Yorkshire Personal banking services are offered on behalf of a number of \\"partner banks\\" that the Post Office has agreements with. Although different services are available on behalf of different institutions, these may include cash withdrawals, paying in cash and cheques, and balance enquiries. Some post offices also have cash machines, mainly provided by Bank of Ireland. Business banking services are also offered for customers of twenty different UK banks. Services include balance enquiries, cash withdrawals, depositing cash and cheques, and giving change. ===Bill payments=== Post office in Corsham, Wiltshire A number of bill payments can be accepted on behalf of a variety of organisations including utilities, local authorities and others. These are in the form of automated payments (barcoded bills, swipe cards, key charging). The Santander Transcash system, which had been a Girobank service, enabled manual bill payment transactions, but this service was discontinued by Santander in December 2017. ===Broadband and phone=== The Post Office also operates as an internet service provider; providing consumer broadband and phone services and is part of the wider Post Office Limited Group. By February 2019, it had just over half a million customers across the UK. Post Office provides asymmetric digital subscriber line broadband and fibre broadband internet products (FTTC) to residential customers. Post Office offers two variants of router: A standard Wi-Fi router (Zyxel AMG1302-T11C) router with its ADSL broadband packages and the Zyxel VMG3925-B10B with its Fibre broadband packages. Post Office Broadband and Phone services are currently supplied using the TalkTalk network and it operates UK-based call centres, with teams based in Preston, Selkirk and Chiswick. Post Office also runs its own flat rate 118 Directory Enquiries service (118 855). Mobile phone top ups are also available in Post Office branches on behalf of all the major UK mobile networks. In June 2015 the Post Office launched its own mobile virtual network operator service, Post Office Mobile. However, in August 2016 it decided \\"to conclude the trial as the results did not give us sufficient confidence that mobile will contribute to our goal of commercial sustainability\\". ===ID services=== A passport check- and-send service is available for passport applications, where the post office staff check that a passport application is filled in correctly and has an acceptable photograph accompanying it. The service is not affiliated with HM Passport Office. Check-and-send service is not guaranteed service. The Post Office used to offer a check-and-send service with DVLA for the photocard driving licence. Some branches now offer a photocard driving licence renewal service. Fishing licences are issued on behalf of the Environment Agency from branches in England and Wales. Selected branches issue International Driving Permits. In 2019, availability of this service was expanded from 89 to approximately 2,500 branches due to increased demand associated with the possibility of a \\"no deal\\" Brexit. ===Post Office saving stamps=== Post Office savings stamps were first introduced by Henry Fawcett in the 1880s but were phased out in the 1960s. These were re-introduced in August 2004 because of consumer demand. In 2010 saving stamps were withdrawn and replaced by the Budget Card. ===Other services=== * National Lottery games and scratchcards * Sale and encashment of postal orders * Foreign currency exchange and Travel Money Card * Sales of gift vouchers redeemable at certain high street merchants * PostPak * Fast drop * Drop and Go * National Express coach tickets ==Post offices not open to the public== Seven post office branches are not open to the public: *Court (Buckingham Palace) – however, this is managed by Royal Mail as of 2014 *House of Commons *Portcullis House *Royal Automobile Club, 89 Pall Mall, London *Scottish Parliament *Windsor Castle *20 Finsbury Street, London, EC2Y 9AQ. Post Office HQ ==ControversiesHorizon payment system errors=== In April 2015, the BBC described a confidential report that alleged that the Post Office had made 'failings' with regard to accounting issues with its Horizon IT system that were identified by sub-postmasters as early as 2000. The article claimed that an independent investigation by forensic accountants Second Sight had found that the Post Office had failed to identify the root cause of accounting shortfalls in many cases before launching court proceedings against sub-postmasters. The shortfalls could have been caused by criminals using malicious software, by IT systems or by human error, the report said. An earlier article by the BBC had claimed that a confidential report contained allegations that the Post Office had refused to hand over documents that the accountants felt they needed to investigate properly, that training was not good enough, that equipment was outdated, and that power cuts and communication problems had made things worse. The Post Office has claimed that their system was not at fault. In 2019, the Post Office was lambasted by the High Court for its 'institutional obstinacy or refusal to consider' that its Horizon computer system might be flawed. The judge, Mr Justice Fraser, characterised this stance as \\"the 21st-century equivalent of maintaining that the earth is flat.\\"https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/post-office-attacked-and-disparaged- sub-postmasters-judge-finds/5102542.article In spite of the court action against its sub-postmasters, which was described by a judge as \\"aggressive and, literally, dismissive\\", the Post Office's chief executive Paula Vennells, who had in the meantime left the Post Office and taken up posts in the NHS and the Cabinet Office, was controversially awarded a CBE in the 2019 New Year Honours for \\"services to the Post Office and to charity\\". On 19 March 2020 she was harshly criticised in the House of Commons, particularly by Kevan Jones, MP for North Durham, who said: ==See also== *Penny Post Credit Union *1st Class Credit Union ==References== ==External links== * *Postwatch – the watchdog for postal services joined Consumer Focus in October 2008 Category:Financial services companies established in 1986 Category:Government- owned companies of the United Kingdom Category:Postal system of the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies established in 1986 Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Royal Mail Category:1986 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Post Office Ltd"},{"id":"516295","text":"Interstate 285 (I-285) is an Interstate Highway loop encircling Atlanta, Georgia, for . It connects the three major interstate highways to Atlanta: I-20, I-75 and I-85. Colloquially referred to as The Perimeter, it also carries unsigned State Route 407 (SR 407), and is signed as Atlanta Bypass on I-75/I-85. Because of suburban sprawl, it is estimated that more than two million people use the highway each day, making it the busiest Interstate in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and one of the most heavily traveled roadways in the United States. During rush hour, portions of the highway slow, sometimes to a crawl. ==Route description== I-285 is eight to 12 lanes wide, with the northern part from I-75 to SR 400 to I-85 the most heavily traveled. One segment of the highway near Spaghetti Junction (a large, flyover highway interchange northeast of Atlanta) with I-85 widens to 18 lanes, including collector-distributor lanes. Exits are numbered clockwise, starting at the southwesternmost point at I-85, and ending just east of there where it meets I-85 again near Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Between I-85 and I-20 in southwest Fulton County, I-285 is designated as the Bob A. Holmes Freeway, where I-285 heads north, and has an interchange with the Langford Parkway. Between I-20 in northwest Atlanta and I-75 near Cumberland Mall, it is designated as the James E. 'Billy' McKinney Highway as it continues north, and starts to curve to the east just west of the I-75 interchange. The northern portion of I-285, east of the Cobb Cloverleaf (I-75 interchange) to Spaghetti Junction (I-85 interchange), is frequently referred to as the Top End Perimeter. This section, which includes an interchange with SR 400 at exit 27 (frequently cited as the most dangerous intersections in Atlanta), is one of the busiest freeways in the United States, handling about 250,000 cars per day and crossing through Cobb, Fulton and DeKalb counties, with several interchanges (SR 141, SR 13, and I-85) bringing traffic to and from Gwinnett County. Through that stretch, the freeway expands from six or eight lanes to between ten and fourteen lanes. While I-285 does not travel through Gwinnett County, the highway travels very close to the DeKalb–Gwinnett county line and many major highways in Gwinnett County connect to I-285, with some prominent ones being US 78, I-85, and SR 141\\\\. Major Gwinnett cities near I-285 are Peachtree Corners and Norcross. From exit 25 to exit 27, I-285 is concurrent with US 19. Much of Atlanta's high-end commercial real estate has developed along I-285, particularly at the northwestern I-75 and the SR 400 interchanges. Notable buildings include the 35-story King and Queen towers in the Perimeter Center business district and the Cobb Galleria complex in the Cumberland/Galleria area. East of Spaghetti Junction, I-285's direction switches from east to south, as it connects with the Stone Mountain Freeway at exit 39, and has an interchange with I-20 at exit 46, where I-285 starts to curve towards the southwest. At exit 52, it has an interchange with Interstate 675, and heads straight west after the interchange with I-75 near the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. I-285 at the I-20 interchange east of Atlanta A portion of the section between I-75 and I-85 on the south side of I-285 has been bridged with a new runway and taxiway of Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of only two interstates in the nation (along with I-564 in Norfolk, VA) to have an underpass beneath a runway (underpasses for taxiways do occur elsewhere). Computer animations were developed prior to construction to simulate a jumbo jet touching down on the runway from a driver's perspective. The entire highway within the tunnels is outfitted with stopped-vehicle sensors and fire detectors. Two electronic signs on either side of the tunnels can warn drivers if the tunnel is closed in an emergency. For in the southwest corner, I-85 occupies the median of I-285, yet the roadways remain separate. Heavy trucks traveling through (but not into) Atlanta are required to bypass the city on I-285, as there is a well-signed and heavily enforced ban on through truck traffic along I-75, I-85, I-20, SR 400, and many other major Atlanta thoroughfares. As with highways just outside I-285, trucks are also prohibited from the far-left one or two lanes (except where there are left exits open to trucks). The complete circumference of I-285 is covered by Georgia NaviGAtor, Georgia's intelligent transportation system (ITS). There have been 153 CCTV traffic cameras, 26 electronic message signs, and traffic-detection sensors installed in phases between 1999 and 2010 by Georgia DOT. Additionally, ramp meters are present at nearly all entrance ramps onto I-285, with the exception of the southeast section of I-285 and the major freeway-to-freeway connection ramps. To many residents of Atlanta, the Perimeter defines a useful boundary to separate metro Atlanta's core from its surrounding suburbs. People distinguish a location as being inside or outside the Perimeter, sometimes abbreviated as ITP and OTP, a recent local neologism. This was also the rough boundary chosen by BellSouth for separating landline telephone exchanges in suburban area code 770 from the existing area code 404 in 1995. Generally, 404 is Atlanta itself and most suburbs inside the Perimeter, while 770 serves most of the suburbs outside the Perimeter. The entire length of I-285 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. ==History== 185px I-285 was completed and opened in sections, with the entire highway officially opened on October 15, 1969 at a cost of $90 million, as a four-lane freeway throughout (two lanes each way). The reconstruction of I-285, particularly on the top-end and the Spaghetti Junction reconfiguration (covered by the revive285 project), has cost about $355 million. Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential interchange numbering system on all of its Interstate highways. The first exit on each highway began with the number \\"1\\" and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, the Georgia Department of Transportation switched to a mileage- based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost.Georgia's Interstate Exit Numbers Georgia Department of Transportation - online. Accessed April 30, 2007.Interstate 20 Exit Renumbering Page Georgia Department of Transportation - online. Accessed April 30, 2007. Georgia DOT voted in September 2012 to raise the speed limit from on the entire freeway, and by 2013 to install electronic signs for variable speed limits north of I-20, to lower the speed limit when traffic or weather conditions warrant. This is intended to keep traffic moving at a reduced but steady speed, rather than suddenly braking drivers causing traffic to \\"clot\\" simply because other drivers are also braking (which causes unnecessary stop- and-go traffic). In 2013, there were 26 fatal accidents on I-285, giving it the highest rate of such accidents per of any interstate in the country. ==Future== Since the 1970s, the Georgia Department of Transportation has planned an outer loop, which would be a roughly circumferential loop around metropolitan Atlanta. Under Governor Sonny Perdue, the plans were dropped from the Regional Transportation Plan, in favor of the expansion of the rural state road network outside of Atlanta. The state will instead widen portions of state route 20 in north metro Atlanta, along a similar alignment to the Northern Arc. Georgia DOT broke ground in November 2017 on major improvements to the I-285 / SR 400 interchange. The project includes collector/distributor roads along I-285 and SR 400, the addition of a diverging diamond interchange at SR 400 and Abernathy Road, and new flyover ramps. The project has total costs of $800 million and construction is expected to be complete in late 2020. In January 2016, governor Nathan Deal announced the major mobility investment program (MMIP), a collection of mega projects planned around the state. The program includes the addition of express lanes on I-285 from I-20 / exit 10 across the north end of Atlanta to I-20 / exit 46. The program also includes reconstructing the interchanges with I-20. The MMIP will construct two express lanes in each direction between Paces Ferry Road / mile 19 and Henderson Road / mile 35. This segment includes the addition of express lanes through major interchanges with I-75, Georgia 400, and I-85. Other projects will construct one express lane in each direction between I-20 / exit 10 and Paces Ferry Road, and from Henderson Road to I-20 / exit 46. The completion of all express lanes is planned in 2032. On July 31, 2012, metro-area voters rejected the T-SPLOST comprehensive transportation plan that was to be funded by an additional one-percent sales tax over a ten-year period. Among the projects included in the plan was a new exit on I-285 at Greenbriar Parkway on the southwest side of Atlanta (between present exits 2 & 5), as well as major reconstruction of interchanges at exits 27 (US 19/SR 400), 10 (I-20 west of Atlanta) and 33 (I-85 northeast of Atlanta). ==Exit list== The following exits are listed clockwise from the southwest: going south to north, west to east, north to south and east to west. An exception is that heading anti-clockwise, exit 33 comes before exit 34. ==In popular culture== Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez became widely associated with I-285 after he got lost on it while trying to drive to a game. On August 19, 1982, Pérez, who had just received his first U.S. driver's license, decided to drive himself to Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (where the Braves played their home games at the time), where he was scheduled to start that evening's game against the Montreal Expos. He was unable to find the proper exit and circled the city several times before running out of gas and calling for help. When Pérez failed to arrive at the stadium by game time, the Braves called upon veteran pitcher Phil Niekro to make the emergency start. The Braves, who had been mired in a 2–19 slump, won the game, kicking off a 13–2 winning streak which carried the team to the National League West division title. The team subsequently made for Pérez a warm-up jacket with the notation \\"I-285\\" in place of his uniform number. The humor of the incident was credited for helping to improve the morale of the team and breaking the losing streak. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== * Interstate 285 (history and facts) * Revive 285 top end (corridor project) 85-2 85-2 Category:Roads in Atlanta 285 2 Category:College Park, Georgia Category:Doraville, Georgia Category:Dunwoody, Georgia Category:Sandy Springs, Georgia Category:Transportation in Fulton County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Cobb County, Georgia Category:Transportation in DeKalb County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Clayton County, Georgia Category:1963 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Interstate 285 (Georgia)"},{"id":"516296","text":"Fourteen 1929, 2-litre 4-cylinder Wizard 1932, 3-litre 6-cylinder Hawk 1936, 3-litre 6-cylinder Minx 1937, 1185 cc 4-cylinder Hillman is a British automobile marque created by the Hillman Motor Car Company, founded in 1907. The company was based in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, near Coventry, England. Before 1907 the company had built bicycles. Newly under the control of the Rootes brothers, the Hillman company was acquired by Humber in 1928. Hillman was used as the small car marque of Humber Limited from 1931, but until 1937 Hillman did continue to sell large cars. The Rootes brothers reached a sixty per cent holding of Humber in 1932 which they retained until 1967, when Chrysler bought Rootes and bought out the other forty per cent of shareholders in Humber. The marque continued to be used under Chrysler until 1976. ==HistoryOrigins=== In 1857 Josiah Turner and James Starley formed the Coventry Sewing Machine Company, and recruited skilled engineers from the London area to join them, one of whom was William Hillman. In 1869 the firm changed its name to the Coventry Machinists Company, and like many other manufacturers in the area embarked on producing velocipedes. In 1870 Hillman and Starley patented a new bicycle called the \\"Ariel\\" and by 1885 Hillman was a partner of the bicycle manufacturer Hillman Herbert and Cooper, producing a bicycle called the Kangaroo. Hillman's new company soon established itself, and before the turn of the 20th century, Hillman was a millionaire. With wealth came the means to fulfil Hillman's next ambition, to become a car producer. Hillman had moved into Abingdon House in Stoke Aldermoor near Coventry and decided that a sensible plan would be to set up a car factory in its grounds. in 1907 Hillman-Coatalen, was founded by William Hillman with the Breton Louis Coatalen as designer and chief engineer. They launched the 24HP Hillman- Coatalen (named after its designer), which was entered into that year's Tourist Trophy. The car was put out of the race by a crash, but it had made a splash. Coatalen left in 1909 to join Sunbeam and the company was re- registered as the Hillman Motor Car Company in 1910. The first cars were large, featuring a 9.76-litre 6-cylinder engine or a 6.4-litre four. A smaller car, the 9 hp of 1913 with a 1357 cc side-valve four-cylinder engine, was the first to sell in significant numbers and was re-introduced after the First World War as the 11 hp, having grown to 1600 cc. The big seller was the 14 hp introduced in 1925, and the only model made until 1928. Following the fashion of the time a Straight Eight of 2.6 litres and Hillman's first use of overhead valves came in 1928 but soon gained a reputation for big-end problems. ==Alumni== William Hillman had six daughters and no sons. A daughter married John Black, managing director of Hillman, who left at the time of the Rootes takeover and went to Standard Motor Co. Another daughter married Maurice Wilks who left Hillman in the same period and eventually went to Rover Company.Martin Adeney, Hillman, William (1848–1921), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004 ===Rootes Group=== In 1928, Hillman fell under the control of the Rootes brothers and then merged with Humber. The Rootes brothers obtained further backing from Prudential Assurance during 1931 and brought their holding up to 60 per cent of Humber. Then, in stages, Hillman was switched to manufacturing small cars and became the best known brand within the Rootes empire alongside Humber, Sunbeam and, in the Rootes Group's final decade, Singer. The 1930s saw a return to side valves with a 6-cylinder Wizard first produced in April 1931 and, in 1932, inspired by the Rootes brothers, the first car to carry the Minx name. This had a 1185 cc four-cylinder engine and went through a series of updates in body style and construction until the end of the Second World War. In 1934 the Hillman Wizard \\"65\\" and \\"75\\" were replaced by the 2110 cc Hillman \\"16 hp\\" and 2810cc \\"20/70\\", which lasted until 1936 when a new body design in the form of the 2576 cc Hillman \\"Sixteen\\" and the 3181 cc \\"Hawk\\" and \\"80\\", all with side valve straight-six engines, were introduced. These later cars were also sold as Humbers. After the war, the Minx was reintroduced with the same 1185 cc engine. It went through a series of models given Phase numbers and the Phase VIII of 1955 saw the arrival of an overhead-valve engine 1390cc, the Mk 8. The later 1956 Two Tone version of this model, the Mark 8A, was called the \\"Gay Look\\" and led to the advertising slogan \\"As Gay as a Mardi Gras\\". A smaller car, the Husky with van like body and using the old side-valve engine, was also new for 1954. The floor pan of this model was later to form the basis for the Sunbeam Alpine, Sunbeam also being part of the Rootes empire. A complete departure in 1963 was the Hillman Imp using a Coventry Climax all alloy, 875 cc rear engine and built in a brand new factory in Linwood, Scotland. The location was chosen under government influence to bring employment to a depressed area. A fastback version, the Californian, and an estate re-using the Husky name were also made. A new car called the Hunter was introduced in 1966 with, in 1967, a smaller-engined standard version using the old Minx name. These are frequently given their factory code of \\"Arrow\\", but this name was never officially used in marketing. ===Chrysler=== Chrysler had assumed complete control of Rootes by 1967, and the first new Hillman model whose development was financed by the American giant was the Avenger of 1970. Husky 1966, 1390 cc 4-cylinder Hunter 1967, 1725 cc 4-cylinder Imp 1971, 875 cc 4-cylinder Avenger 1972, 1248 cc 4-cylinder ===Peugeot=== The Avenger and Hunter ranges were rebadged as Chryslers until 1979, when Chrysler sold its European division to Peugeot. At this point, Hunter production was shelved and the Avenger was rebadged as a Talbot until it was finally withdrawn from sale at the end of 1981. Hillman's Ryton factory, which had assembled various Peugeot models for the European market, closed in 2007. The French company still owns the rights to the Hillman name. ==Car models== Cars introduced after 1930 were a new range to the specification of the Rootes brothers * Hillman 40 hp 1907–1911 (also known as 40/60) * Hillman 25 hp 1909–1913 (also known as 25/40) * Hillman 12/15 1908–1913 * Hillman 9 hp 1913–1915 * Hillman 10 hp 1910 * Hillman 13/25 1914 * Hillman 11 1915–1926 * Hillman 10 hp Super Sports 1920–1922 * Hillman 14 1925–1930 Cars to the specification of the Rootes brothers * Hillman 20 range: ::Straight Eight 1929 ::Vortic 1930 ::Wizard 75 1931–1933 ::Twenty 70 1934–1935 ::Hawk 1936–1937 ::Long wheelbase Hillman 20s: :::Seven-Seater LWB 1934–1935 :::Hillman 80 LWB 1936–1938 * Hillman 16 range: ::Wizard 65 1931–1933 ::Sixteen 1934–1937 * Hillman Minx 1932–1970 (various models) * Hillman 14 1938–1940 * Hillman Husky 1954–1963 * Hillman Super Minx 1961–1967 * Hillman Imp 1963–1976 * Hillman Gazelle 1966–1967 (Australia) * Hillman Hunter 1966–1979 * Hillman Arrow 1967–1968 (Australia) * Hillman Avenger 1970–1981 * Hillman Hustler 1971–1972 (Australia) ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== *Hillman Wizard website *Hillman Sixteen/Hawk/80 website Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Rootes Group Category:Coventry motor companies Category:Chrysler ","title":"Hillman"},{"id":"516297","text":"The 1936 Quebec general election was held on August 17, 1936 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.

This marked the end of slightly more than 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals, who had governed Quebec since the 1897 election. This 1936 election had been called less than one year after the 1935 election after Liberal premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau resigned because of a scandal. He was replaced by Godbout as Liberal leader and premier. This was Duplessis's first term in office. After losing the subsequent 1939 election, he later won four more general elections in a row, and became the dominant politician of his time.

Having acquired a reputation as a skilled character actor in the 1980s and 1990s, Pastorelli's career went into decline after the death of his girlfriend under mysterious circumstances at his home in 1999. He died of a narcotic overdose in 2004.Screen World: 2005 Film Annual By John Willis, Barry Monush. Hal Leonard Corporation p.386 ==Early life== Pastorelli was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of Ledo Pastorelli (1918-2008),https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/27653041/ledo-j_-pastorelli an insurance salesman and Dotty, an artist.

He initially intended a career as a professional boxer, but had to abandon the sport due to injuries sustained in a near-fatal high-speed car crash at the age of 19 (he later claimed that he had a \\"near death\\" incident at this time, and that he had experienced himself looking down from above upon his body in the hospital bed with his father at the bedside overcome with grief). He acquired a narcotic habit in his early twenties prior to his acting career that he overcame, but he would relapse throughout his later life. ==Theater career== He entered the acting profession via New York City theater in the late 1970s after studying at the New York Academy of Theatrical Arts and the Actors Studio, financially maintaining himself by working as a bartender. In 1977 he made his stage debut in a production of Rebel Without a Cause. He also performed in productions of The Rainmaker, and Death of a Salesman.Obituary for Pastorelli, 'Los Angeles Times', 10 March 2004. Later in his career he performed at London's South Bank theater in A Streetcar Named Desire in 2002. ==Hollywood== In 1982 Pastorelli headed west to Los Angeles seeking opportunities in Hollywood. Spending the early 1980s employed in television bit-part appearances, he found a niche playing streetwise characters, appearing also in supporting roles in the cinema films Outrageous Fortune (1987) and Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). His first substantial cinematic role came with Dances with Wolves (1990). His big break in television came with the role of the gruff but lovable house painter \\"Eldin Bernecky\\" on the series Murphy Brown, which was a ratings hit, and he stayed with the show for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994. Murphy Brown producer Diane English was sufficiently impressed with his abilities that she worked with him to produce his first starring vehicle, the television sitcom Double Rush which lasted one season in 1995. Two years later, he starred in the American adaptation of the British detective series Cracker (1997–1999). As his television career gained momentum Pastorelli's opportunities in cinema roles increased: Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993); a career defining performance playing a demented serial killer in the 1993 murder mystery thriller Striking Distance (although the movie was not a commercial success); Eraser (1996), Michael (1996), and Modern Vampires (1998).Entry for Pastorelli's career in IMDb website (2019). https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0665123/ ==Charemon Jonovich shooting== On the evening of March 15, 1999, during an incident at his Hollywood home, Pastorelli's 25-year-old girlfriend, Charemon Jonovich, was killed by a gunshot to the head. During the authorities' investigation that followed, Pastorelli testified that in the midst of an argument between the two of them, she suddenly produced a handgun and killed herself. The incident was investigated as an accident or suicide, and the Los Angeles Coroner's Office declared the cause of death undetermined. ==Final years== Pastorelli was exonerated of responsibility for Charemon Jonovich's death and received public expressions of sympathy within Hollywood and from the Los Angeles media, but his career went into noticeable decline afterwards. He appeared in two more cinema productions in small roles in the early 2000s as well as some minor supporting roles in television productions. He developed a friendship with Glenn Close towards the end of his career, and appeared alongside her in the television films The Ballad of Lucy Whipple, and in South Pacific in 2001. In 2002 he again appeared alongside her at London's Royal National Theatre in a performance of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. In 2002 he co- founded the Garden State Film Festival. His posthumous final screen appearance was in the movie Be Cool (2005). ==Death== Pastorelli was found dead at the age of 49 at his home in the Hollywood Hills on March 8, 2004, from a narcotics overdose. 'Murphy Brown star was murder suspect'. At the time of his death he had been forewarned that authorities were planning on arresting him for further questioning regarding the shooting of Charemon Jonovich in March 1999. A review of the original evidence had resulted in her death being reclassified as a homicide, with Pastorelli being identified as a suspect for further investigation. The Coroner's Office reported Pastorelli died of a \\"fatal blood concentration of morphine\\". Report 4 August 2004. Pastorelli's body was interred in the mausoleum at Saint Catharine's Cemetery in Sea Girt, New Jersey. ==Personal life == Pastorelli had two daughters, Gianna Li Pastorelli (born February 6, 1998) with Charemon Jonovich, and Giannina Marie Pastorelli (born March 6, 2000) with his then girlfriend, Jalee Carder. ==Filmography== * Barney Miller (1982, TV Series) as Edward Guthrie * Knight Rider (1983, TV Series) as Leroy * Newhart (1983, TV Series) as Prisoner * I Married a Centerfold (1984, TV Movie) as Guard * Hunter (1985, TV Series) as Willie Wakefield * California Girls (1985, TV Movie) as Mechanic * The A-Team (1985, TV Series) as Juarez's Henchman * Beauty and the Beast (1987–1988, TV Series) as Vick Ramos / Tony Perotta * Miami Vice (1987, TV series) as Vespa * Outrageous Fortune (1987) as Dealer #2 * Hands of a Stranger (1987, TV Movie) as Handyman * Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) as Vinnie * Memories of Me (1988) as Al (Broccoli) * Lady Mobster (1988, TV Movie) as Matteo Villani * Murphy Brown (1988–1994, TV Series) as Eldin Bernecky * Dances with Wolves (1990) as Timmons * FernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992) as Tony (voice) * Folks!

Some examples include \\"gosh\\" (God), \\"darn\\", or \\"dang\\" (damn), \\"doggone\\", or \\"gosh darn\\" (goddamn), \\"shucks\\", \\"shoot\\", \\"shinola\\" “shiitake” (shit), \\"heck\\" (hell), \\"gee\\", \\"jeez\\", \\"jeepers\\", \\"crikey\\", or \\"Jiminy Cricket\\" (Jesus Christ),Middletown Bible Church (info on minced oaths) http://www.middletownbiblechurch.org/christia/minced.htm \\"feck\\", \\"fudge\\", \\"frick\\", \\"fork\\", \\"flip\\", or \\"eff\\" (fuck). Many languages have such expressions. In the English language, nearly all profanities have minced variants.Hughes, 12. ==Formation== Common methods of forming a minced oath are rhyme and alliteration. Thus the word bloody (which itself may be an elision of \\"By Our Lady\\"—referring to the Virgin Mary) can become blooming, or ruddy. Alliterative minced oaths such as darn for damn allow a speaker to begin to say the prohibited word and then change to a more acceptable expression.Hughes, 7. In rhyming slang, rhyming euphemisms are often truncated so that the rhyme is eliminated; prick became Hampton Wick and then simply Hampton. Another well-known example is \\"cunt\\" rhyming with \\"Berkeley Hunt\\", which was subsequently abbreviated to \\"berk\\". Alliteration can be combined with metrical equivalence, as in the pseudo-blasphemous \\"Judas Priest\\", substituted for the blasphemous use of \\"Jesus Christ\\". Minced oaths can also be formed by shortening: e.g., b for bloody or f for fuck. Sometimes words borrowed from other languages become minced oaths; for example, poppycock comes from the Dutch pappe kak, meaning \\"soft dung\\".Hughes, 16–17. The minced oath blank is an ironic reference to the dashes that are sometimes used to replace profanities in print. It goes back at least to 1854, when Cuthbert Bede wrote \\"I wouldn't give a blank for such a blank blank. I'm blank, if he doesn't look as if he'd swallowed a blank codfish.\\" By the 1880s, it had given rise to the derived forms blanked and blankety, definition 12b for blank which combined together gave the name of the long-running and popular British TV show Blankety Blank. In the same way, bleep arose from the use of a tone to mask profanities on radio.Hughes, 18–19. ==History== The Cretan king Rhadamanthus is said to have forbidden his subjects to swear by the gods, suggesting that they instead swear by the ram, the goose or the plane tree. Socrates favored the \\"Rhadamanthine\\" oath \\"by the dog\\", with \\"the dog\\" often interpreted as referring to the bright \\"Dog Star\\", i.e., Sirius. Aristophanes mentions that people used to swear by birds instead of by the gods, adding that the soothsayer Lampon still swears by the goose \\"whenever he's going to cheat you\\". Since no god was called upon, Lampon may have considered this oath safe to break. There are a number of minced oaths in the Bible. For example, use of the names or titles of God would be inappropriate in the Song of Songs because it is a secular text. Thus in verse 2.7, the Shulamite says, \\"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the wild does.\\" The Hebrew words ṣᵉba’ot 'gazelles' and ’aylot haśśadeh 'wild does' are circumlocutions for titles of God, the first for either (’elohey) ṣᵉba’ot '(God of) Hosts' or (YHWH) ṣᵉba’ot '(Jehovah is) Armies' and the second for ’el šadday 'El Shaddai'. The use of minced oaths in English dates back at least to the 14th century, when \\"gog\\" and \\"kokk\\", both euphemisms for God, were in use. Other early minced oaths include \\"Gis\\" or \\"Jis\\" for Jesus (1528).Hughes, 13–15. Late Elizabethan drama contains a profusion of minced oaths, probably due to Puritan opposition to swearing. Seven new minced oaths are first recorded between 1598 and 1602, including sblood for \\"By God's blood\\" from Shakespeare, 'slight for \\"God's light\\" from Ben Jonson, and 'snails for \\"God's nails\\" from the historian John Hayward. Swearing on stage was officially banned by the Act to Restraine Abuses of Players in 1606, and a general ban on swearing followed in 1623. Other examples from the 1650s included 'slid for \\"By God's eyelid\\" (1598), sfoot for \\"By God's foot\\" (1602), and Gadzooks for \\"By God's hooks\\" (referring to the nails on Christ's cross). In the late 17th century, egad meant oh God, and ods bodikins for \\"By God's bodkins [i.e. nail]s\\" in 1709.Hughes, 13. In some cases the original meanings of these minced oaths were forgotten; the oath 'struth (By God's truth) came to be spelled strewth. The oath Zounds and related Wounds changed pronunciation in the Great Vowel Shift, but the normal word wound did not (at least not in RP), so that they no longer sound like their original meaning of \\"By God's wounds\\".Hughes, 103–105. ==Acceptability== Although minced oaths are not as strong as the expressions from which they derive, some audiences may still find them offensive. One writer in 1550 considered \\"idle oaths\\" like \\"by cocke\\" (by God), \\"by the cross of the mouse foot\\", and \\"by Saint Chicken\\" to be \\"most abominable blasphemy\\". The minced oaths \\"'sblood\\" and \\"zounds\\" were omitted from the Folio edition of Shakespeare's play Othello, probably as a result of Puritan-influenced censorship. In 1941 a U.S. federal judge threatened a lawyer with contempt of court for using the word \\"darn\\". Zounds may sound amusing and archaic to the modern ear, yet as late as 1984 the columnist James J. Kilpatrick recalled that \\"some years ago\\", after using it in print, he had received complaints that it was blasphemous because of its origin as \\"God's wounds\\". (He had written an article entitled \\"Zounds! Is Reagan Mad?\\" in the Spartanburg Herald for 12 June 1973, and also used \\"zounds\\" in June 1970.) ==Literature and censorship== It is common to find minced oaths in literature and media. Writers sometimes face the problem of portraying characters who swear and often include minced oaths instead of profanity in their writing so that they will not offend audiences or incur censorship. One example is The Naked and the Dead, where publishers required author Norman Mailer to use the minced oath \\"fug\\" over his objections. \\"How the F Word was written in 1948\\" Slate.com Somerset Maugham referred to this problem in his 1919 novel The Moon and Sixpence, in which the narrator explained that \\"Strickland, according to Captain Nichols, did not use exactly the words I have given, but since this book is meant for family reading, I thought it better—at the expense of truth—to put into his mouth language familiar to the domestic circle\\".Maugham, Somerset. The Moon and Sixpence, ch. 47; quoted in Hughes, 187. J. R. R. Tolkien pretends a similar mincing of profanity in The Lord of the Rings, stating in In Appendix F of the novel: \\"But Orcs and Trolls spoke as they would, without love of words or things; and their language was actually more degraded and filthy than I have shown it. I do not suppose that any will wish for a closer rendering, though models are easy to find.\\" ==See also== * Bowdlerization * Eggcorn * Expletive deleted * Four-letter word * Fuddle duddle * Euphemism Treadmill ==Footnotes== ==Works cited== * * Category:Profanity Category:Interjections Category:Self-censorship Category:Euphemisms ","title":"Minced oath"},{"id":"516327","text":"Michael Snow (born December 10, 1928) is a Canadian artist working in a range of media including film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music. His best-known films are Wavelength (1967) and La Région Centrale (1971), with the former regarded as a milestone in avant-garde cinema. ==Life== Michael Snow was born in Toronto and studied at Upper Canada College and the Ontario College of Art. He had his first solo exhibition in 1957. In the early 1960s Snow moved to New York with his wife, artist Joyce Wieland, where they remained for nearly a decade. For Snow this move resulted in a proliferation of creative ideas and connections and his work increasingly gained recognition. He returned to Canada in the early 1970s \\"an established figure, multiply defined as a visual artist, a filmmaker, and a musician.\\" His work has appeared at exhibitions across Europe, North America and South America. Snows' works were included in the shows marking the reopening of both the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2000 and the MoMA in New York in 2005. In March 2006, his works were included in the Whitney Biennial. ==WorkFilms=== Snow is considered one of the most influential experimental filmmakers. Annette Michelson, in writing about Snow, his 1967 film Wavelength, and his films in general, speaks of the impact of Snow's films, placing viewers in a \\"position to more fully understand the particular impact of Snow's filmic work from 1967 on, to discern the reasons for the large consensus given\\" to Wavelength when it was honoured with the Grand Prize at the 1967 Experimental Film Festival EXPRMNTL 4 in Knokke, Belgium, and that \\"Wavelength, [appears] as a celebration of the 'apparatus' and a confirmation of the status of the subject, and it is in those terms that we may begin to comprehend the profound effect it had upon the broadest spectrum of viewers....\\" Michelson, \\"About Snow\\" October Vol. 8 (Spring, 1979): 118. Wavelength has been the subject of numerous retrospectives internationally. Film scholar Scott MacDonald says of Snow that \\"[f]ew filmmakers have had as large an impact on the recent avant- garde film scene as Canadian Michael Snow, whose Wavelength is probably the most frequently discussed 'structural' film.\\"Scott MacDonald, \\"So Is This by Michael Snow\\" Film Quarterly Vol. 39, No. 1 (Autumn, 1985): 34. Wavelength has been designated and preserved as a masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada and was named #85 in the 2001 Village Voice critics' list of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century . Snow's films have premiered in film festivals worldwide and five of his films have premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). In 2000, TIFF commissioned Snow, along with Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, to make a series of short films collectively titled Preludes, for the 25th Anniversary of the festival. In his Village Voice review of Snow's 2002 film *Corpus Callosum, J. Hoberman writes that Snow's films are \\"[r]igorously predicated on irreducible cinematic facts [and] Snow's structuralist epics—Wavelength and La Région Centrale—[announce] the imminent passing of the film era. Rich with new possibilities, *Corpus Callosum heralds the advent of the next. Whatever it is, it cannot be too highly praised.\\" *Corpus Calossum was screened at the Toronto, Berlin, Rotterdam, and the Los Angeles film festivals amongst others. In January 2003, Snow won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Douglas Edwards Experimental/Independent Film/Video Award for *Corpus Callosum. Tied with Kenneth Anger \\"for his body of work\\". ===Music=== Originally a professional jazz musician, Snow has a long-standing interest in improvised music, as indicated by the soundtrack to his film New York Eye and Ear Control. As a pianist, he has performed solo and with other musicians in North America, Europe and Japan. Snow performs regularly in Canada and internationally, often with the improvisational music ensemble CCMC and has released more than a half dozen albums since the mid-1970s. In 1987, Snow issued The Last LP (Art Metropole), which purported to be a documentary recording of the dying gasps of ethnic musical cultures from around the globe including Tibet, Syria, India, China, Brazil, Finland and elsewhere, with more thousands of words of pseudo-scholarly supplementary notes, but was, in fact, a series of multi- tracked recordings of Snow himself, who gave the joke away only in a single column of text in the disc's gatefold jacket, printed backwards and readable in a mirror. One track, purported to be a document of a coming-of-age ritual from Niger, is a pastiche of Whitney Houston's song \\"How Will I Know.\\" Snow, with Richard Serra, James Tenney and Bruce Nauman, performed Steve Reich's Pendulum Music on May 27, 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. ===Other media=== Canada geese in flight. Before Snow moved to New York in 1961, he began a long-term project that for six years would be his trademark: the Walking Woman. Martha Langford in Michael Snow: Life & Work describes this work as employing a single form that offered an infinite number of creative possibilities, the figure itself perceived variably as \\"a positive (a presence to be looked at) and a negative (an absence to be looked through).\\" Langford identifies duality as a guiding principle in Snow’s work. By combining materials and methods Snow creates hybrid objects that often defy classification. A work which exemplifies Snow's testing of stylistic boundaries is his 1979 installation Flight Stop (also titled Flightstop), a site-specific work in Toronto's Eaton Centre mall, which looks like a sculptural representation of sixty geese, but is in fact an intricate combination of fibreglass forms and photographs of a single goose. In 1982, Snow sued the corporate owner of the Toronto Eaton Centre for violating his moral rights by altering Flight Stop. In the landmark case Snow v Eaton Centre Ltd, the Ontario High Court of Justice affirmed the artist's right to the integrity of their work. The operator of the Toronto Eaton Centre was found liable for violating Michael Snow's moral rights by putting Christmas bows on the work.(1982), 70 CPR (2d) 105. Snow's works have been in Canadian pavilion at world fairs since his Walking Women sculpture was exhibited at Expo 67 in Montréal. His recent bookwork BIOGRAPHIE of the Walking Woman / de la femme qui marche 1961-1967 (2004) was published in Brussels by La Lettre vole. It consists of images of the public appearances of his globally famous icon. Anarchive2: Digital Snow describes Michael Snow as \\"one of the most significant artists in contemporary art and cinema of the past 50 years.\\" This 2002 DVD was initiated by Paris’ Centre Pompidou and was produced with the support of la foundation Daniel Langlois, Université de Paris, Heritage Canada, the Canada Council, Téléfilm Canada and Montreal’s Époxy. It is an encyclopedia of Snow's works across media, browsed in a manner inimitably and artfully created by Snow. Its 4,685 entries include film clips, sculpture, photographs, audio and musical clips, and interviews. ==Retrospectives and honours== In the background you can see multiple stadium sculptures on the eastern side of Skydome Rogers Centre. Michael Snow's sculpture 'Red, Orange and Green' (1992) at Rogers Building (Canada) In 1993, The Michael Snow Project, lasting several months, was a multivenue retrospective of Snow’s works in Toronto exhibited at several public venues and at the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Power Plant. Concurrently his works were the subjects of four books published by Alfred A. Knopf Canada. Snow has shown internationally in both galleries and cinemas, including a retrospective of his work at the British Film Institute, London where his celluloid works where shown in the cinemas and his digital works in the gallery (The BFI Gallery). The project, titled 'Yes Snow Show', took place in 2009 and was co-curated by Elisabetta Fabrizi and Chris Meigh-Andrew.Fabrizi, Elisabetta 'The BFI Gallery Book', BFI, London 2011. In 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2007 \\"for his contributions to international visual arts as one of Canada’s greatest multidisciplinary contemporary artists\\". He received the first Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts (2000) for cinema. In 2004, the Université de Paris I, Panthéon-Sorbonne awarded him an honorary doctorate. The last artist so awarded was Pablo Picasso. In 2006, Lima's Museum of Art (MALI) held a selective retrospective exhibition as well as a screening of his films in Peru, as part of the Vide/Art/Electronic Festival. ===Honorary degrees=== Université de Paris I, Panthéon-Sorbonne (2004), Emily Carr Institute, Vancouver (2004) Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax (1990), University of Toronto (1999), University of Victoria (1997), Brock University (1975). ===Academic appointments=== * Visiting Artist/Professor at MAPS (Master of Art in Public Sphere), Ecole Cantonale d’Art du Valais, Sierre, Switzerland (February 2005, January 2006) * Visiting Artist/Professor at L’école Nationale Supérieure d’Art de Bourges, France.

He is the consigliere and second-in-command to Tony Soprano in the DiMeo crime family. ==Character biography== According to The Sopranos, A Family History, Silvio was born in June 1957 in West Orange, New Jersey; his father was Joseph \\"Beppo\\" Dante, of Calabrian origin, a soldier who was \\"gunned down\\" in 1959. Silvio was a childhood friend of Tony and his early criminal activity often involved Tony Soprano and Jackie Aprile, Sr. His original career plan was to be a professional singer, but this dream never materialized. Despite this, Silvio has maintained a connection to show business through ownership of numerous clubs in North Jersey over the years, and in backing aspiring young starlets who come up through his clubs. Silvio's support was instrumental in ensuring Tony took over as capo following the death of his father. Throughout his association with the Soprano crew, Silvio formed friendships with Salvatore \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero and Paulie \\"Walnuts\\" Gualtieri. It was Silvio who reported to Tony that his Uncle Junior planned to murder Pussy Malanga in Artie Bucco's restaurant and who was later entrusted with starting the fire which would ensure the original Vesuvio's burnt down, therefore not ruining its reputation. In the short and bloody war of 1999 with the Junior Soprano crew, Silvio helped Tony to plan hits on Chucky Signore and Mikey Palmice and remained supportive when his friend revealed that he had been seeing a therapist. Silvio is one of the more level-headed associates of Tony Soprano. Where many of Tony's men immediately become hot-headed and resort to violence, Silvio generally helps to mediate many situations and gets along with everyone. He accompanies Tony to most of his \\"sit-downs\\" – a formal venue in the organization to resolve disputes. Because of this, Tony relies on Silvio to be a clear-headed thinker and someone he can trust. Silvio is most often the one to quote Mafia rules and norms when a tough decision is to be made, even if he ends up disagreeing with Tony. Silvio's move to consigliere, once Tony becomes acting boss, seems completely natural. Indeed, Silvio remains Tony's most reliable adviser and enforcer, with only several incidents that show his aggression, such as when Fat Dom Gamiello makes a remark about the late Vito Spatafore (and implying that Carlo Gervasi was gay), an enraged Silvio attacked Fat Dom by hitting him in the back of the head with a handheld vacuum, and then holding his arms behind his back, which leads Carlo to stab Dom repeatedly in the abdomen with a large kitchen knife, and during poker, when he often becomes foul-mouthed and paranoid. Silvio's criminal interests include loan sharking and bookmaking but his day-to-day role is that of managing the Bada Bing, the most recent in a string of strip clubs that he has operated. \\"The Bing\\", as it is often referred to, is not only one of the crime family's major meeting spots, but also doubles as a brothel. Silvio loves and cares about, and is a strong father for, his teenage daughter Heather, whom he calls The Principessa. Silvio says that Heather disapproves of his profession calling it \\"degrading to women\\". Tony has said to him, \\"You're a good father.\\" When his daughter's soccer coach was found to be involved with one of his young players, Silvio looked for vengeance but followed Tony's decision to let the authorities deal with him. Apart from periodic instances of adultery—Christopher says during his intervention in \\"The Strong, Silent Type\\" that Silvio was \\"fucking every slut you got working in the place\\"—it can be said that he also loves his wife, Gabriella Dante (played by Steven Van Zandt's real life wife Maureen Van Zandt), very much. Silvio has a long record of executing traitors throughout the show. He killed Jimmy Altieri at the end of season one. Later, along with Tony and Paulie Walnuts, he executes Pussy Bonpensiero in Season Two. In season five, he executes Adriana La Cerva. All were killed when they were discovered to have been cooperating—or, in the case of Altieri, thought to have been cooperating—with the FBI in their ongoing investigation of the Soprano crime family. Like Tony and Paulie, Bonpensiero's killing haunted Silvio. In Season 6, Silvio also executed Burt Gervasi, garroting him after he discovered that he had been working with the Lupertazzi crime family. Silvio's judgment wavered when he realized Tony was positioning Christopher Moltisanti as an intermediary between him and the rest of the organization because of Chris and Tony's blood ties. This was made most apparent when Paulie was arrested on a gun charge and Tony made Christopher acting capo of his crew in Paulie's absence. Silvio responded by encouraging Gualtieri crew soldier Patsy Parisi to steal from the Esplanade construction site against Tony's and Chris' orders – creating problems for Chris. Silvio also became embroiled in a conflict over a Columbus Day celebration with Native American protesters – something Tony saw as a distraction – going so far as to get many of the family's associates involved in a violent altercation with the protesters. Silvio found it hard to let the conflict die even once Tony had exhausted all avenues of winning the dispute. Silvio did not take this uncharacteristic behavior any further and, although Tony had noticed it, nothing became of it. Silvio got a chance to vent his frustration with Christopher at an intervention for Chris's drug problem that ended with Chris being violently put in his place by Paulie and Silvio. Since Chris returned from rehab, his relationship with Silvio seems to have returned to their previous friendly association. Silvio maintains a realistic relationship with Paulie Gualtieri, well aware of Paulie's tight-fisted attitude towards money and dangerous tendencies. Silvio has remarked to Tony that they know that Paulie does not kick up his full amount. Silvio also tried to warn Paulie that his distractedness had been noticed when Paulie let his loyalties to the Soprano family waver, not long after Silvio's own crisis of faith in Tony. Paulie and Silvio argued about this – Paulie had been harboring resentment toward Silvio since his illness got Paulie into the Pine Barrens fiasco. However, it was not long before Paulie returned his attention to staying in Tony's good graces. Silvio counseled Tony through difficult decisions about Richie Aprile, and his disputes with Ralph Cifaretto, Feech La Manna and Tony Blundetto. He is often forced to convince Tony to go against his impulses – something that he usually manages without setting off Tony's hair-trigger temper. More often than not, when Silvio has something on his mind but won't speak about it, Tony often senses this and gets him to speak up. When Tony ends up in a coma after being shot by his uncle in a fit of dementia, it falls upon Silvio to take the reins as acting boss of the Soprano family. At first, Silvio seemingly enjoys the job, and even feels a slight bit of regret that he did not accept an offer from the late Jackie Aprile, Sr. to become the boss back in the late 1990s. His wife Gabriella prompts him to consider the possibilities of a permanent change. His ambitions quickly subside when he feels the immense pressure of being boss and begins to have asthma attacks brought on by anxiety, as later alluded to by Tony when he says, \\"All due respect, you got no fucking idea what it's like being #1\\". As boss, Silvio dealt effectively with Paulie in a dispute over the split of profits from a heist Paulie had undertaken following a tip from Vito Spatafore. However, Silvio was indecisive in his handling of a dispute between Vito and Bobby Bacala over a collection route. Since his return to the more comfortable role of consigliere, Silvio has again counseled Tony about contentious issues. When Vito was outed to the organization, Silvio convinced Tony of the need to restrain his desire to \\"give him a pass\\" because of the effect it would have on the other captains' view of his leadership. When Tony responded with distasteful jokes to Bobby's serious injury, a look from Silvio was enough to tell him he was being unfair. When Vito Spatafore came back from New Hampshire, Silvio said that there would be popular sentiment to get rid of him, but Tony had initially decided to let Vito run a prostitution ring in Atlantic City. However, when Phil Leotardo confronted Tony about Vito being in New Jersey, Silvio and Tony both knew that they couldn't keep fighting with Phil over the issue and that if they wanted to keep the \\"no show\\" jobs, Vito would have to go. Silvio had always pushed for Spatafore to be taken care of and told Tony that it was the right move and not to beat himself up over the issue. When Phil Leotardo and his men killed Vito (without permission from Tony), Tony told Silvio that it wasn't about Vito, it was about him. Silvio initially told Tony that they should go after one of Phil's men but Tony was trying to avoid a war and instead decided to blow up Phil's wire room in Sheepshead Bay. Silvio and Carlo were at Satriale's Pork Store later that day when \\"Fat Dom\\" Gamiello came by. Dom started making jokes about Vito's homosexuality and implied that Carlo was homosexual. Silvio told Dom to leave, but when Dom continued his ridicule, anger got the best of the usually calm consigliere as he smashed his hand-held vacuum over Dom's head and held him while Carlo stabbed him to death. A short time afterwards, Tony came by the shop to see them. Silvio advised Tony not to enter, but he couldn't stop Tony from finding Dom. Tony stormed out of the shop with Silvio right behind him telling Tony that \\"When you kill a made guy, this is what happens.\\" In the episode \\"Stage 5\\" Silvio was out at lunch with Gerry Torciano, the man Phil Leotardo wanted to take over as boss of the Lupertazzi family, when one of Doc Santoro's assassins killed Torciano. This outraged Tony, as Silvio could have been hurt during that altercation. In the episode \\"The Blue Comet\\", it is revealed that the Lupertazzi family has recruited Burt Gervasi to begin a rebellion against Tony. Burt goes to Silvio to join in a coup d'état against the boss, but Silvio responds by strangling him to death at his home a short time later. Eventually contracts are put out on Silvio, Bobby Bacala, and Tony in order to incapacitate the leadership of the family. Shortly after Bobby is killed, while Patsy Parisi drives Silvio outside of the Bada Bing club, a car moves in front of them, with two men coming out shooting multiple times. Silvio tries taking a pistol off of the back seat, only to be shot in the back. Silvio manages to grab his pistol in time while Parisi holds them off. Parisi manages to defend them, but soon the two men begin to target Silvio more. He is shot once more in the chest, while Patsy runs into the woods, fleeing for his life. Afterwards, Silvio is rushed to the hospital and placed in an intensive care unit. Paulie later tells Tony that Silvio survived the assassination attempt but is in a coma; the doctors say that he is unlikely to regain consciousness. In the final episode, an emotional Tony visits the still comatose Silvio, whose fate is not mentioned further. == Murders committed by Silvio == * James \\"Little Jimmy\\" Altieri: Shot for being a suspected informant.

(2007) ==Character origins== David Chase was impressed with Van Zandt's humorous appearance and presence after seeing him induct The Rascals into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and invited him to audition. Van Zandt, a guitarist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, had never acted before. He auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano, but HBO felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, so Chase wrote a new part for him. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the show as consigliere Silvio Dante, and his real-life spouse Maureen was cast as his on-screen wife Gabriella. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Profile: Silvio Dante Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional consiglieri Category:Fictional gamblers Category:Fictional managers Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional pimps Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional smokers Category:Steven Van Zandt sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Silvio \\"Sil\\" Dante ","title":"Silvio Dante"},{"id":"516336","text":"Captain Holly Short is the protagonist of the Artemis Fowl novel series by Eoin Colfer. ==Character outline== Holly Short is an unusual and quirky elf with an auburn crew cut (although she later grows a fringe) and 1 hazel and 1 blue eye, as well as the pointy ears typical of her species and nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion. She got her name because she is extremely short as she stands at one meter in height (said to be three feet in US editions), one centimeter shorter than the fairy average (an inch shorter in US editions), and has a gymnast-like stance. Like all elves, she is child-sized by human standards, but her bodily proportions are adult. According to Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident, Holly is about eighty years old (Elves and other magic species live much longer than humans. It is said that there is a dwarf over 2000 years old in the book). Holly is the first and only female captain in the organization LEPrecon. In The Artemis Fowl Files, she notes that she eventually earns the respect of her male colleagues. Holly will defy the orders of superiors and disobey rules if she believes that she can be of more help that way, and has gotten into trouble multiple times for defying a direct command. She is described as pretty, but in a dangerous way, comparable to a black widow. Her interests include playing the fairy game \\"Crunchball\\", reading (especially thrillers), and flying with artificial wings. Holly lost her father at a young age. Her mother, Coral Short, is described as a European elf who was temperamental and had an appearance similar to Holly's. Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox reveals that her mother worked in Lower Elements Police division \\"LEPmarine\\" and died after she was exposed to dirty radiation, which is poisonous to fairies. After Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, Holly quits the LEP because the new LEP commander, Ark Sool mentions that he will keep a close eye on her to catch any faults and she begins to work with Mulch Diggums. However, after working as a private detective with Mulch for a short time, she returns to the Section 8 unit of the LEP in Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony, in time to get Artemis, Butler and the others out of trouble. Her relationship with Artemis Fowl has changed dramatically since the beginning of the series, morphing from hostility to grudging respect to friendship, and has recently included substantial hints of a romantic attraction despite the species and age gap (the mental and chronological age gaps being closed in Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony and physical age gap briefly being closed for Artemis Fowl and The Time Paradox, both via extensive time travel). ==AppearancesIn Artemis Fowl=== In Artemis Fowl, Holly is abducted by 12-year-old criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II when he uncovers evidence of fairy existence. He demands one metric ton of gold as her ransom fund. When she consents to granting Artemis's wish of restoring his mother's sanity, he releases her along with half of her ransom fund. Holly also then realizes that she is up for a challenge, and promises to be waiting for him, with \\"a big gun and a smile.\\" ===In The Arctic Incident=== In Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident, Holly is sent to detain Artemis when he is a suspect in a goblin uprising. But to her surprise, the mud boy is innocent of this particular crime and has never traded with goblins. So she, along with Artemis, Mulch Diggums, and Commander Julius Root are informed by Foaly that Opal Koboi and Briar Cudgeon are behind the uprising. They break into Koboi Laboratories, where Briar Cudgeon is killed and Opal Koboi is incapacitated. After the goblins are contained, she travels to Murmansk to rescue Artemis's father, as they previously agreed in return for Artemis's help in capturing Briar Cudgeon and Opal Koboi. ===In The Eternity Code=== In Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code, Artemis requests Holly's help to heal Domovoi Butler after he nearly died and retrieve his C Cube from American businessman Jon Spiro. Together with Mulch Diggums, Juliet Butler, and Foaly directing technological elements of the mission, they break into the Spiro Needle and retrieve the Cube. Artemis is mind wiped at the end of the mission under the directions of Julius Root. ===In The Opal Deception=== In Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, Holly is with Commander Root, a paternal figure to her, when Opal Koboi kills him. She is subsequently framed for the Commander's death and is forced to flee from fairy authorities. She later collaborates with Artemis Fowl, Butler, and Mulch Diggums to expose Koboi and prevent her plans for destroying fairy civilization. Koboi is locked up in a secure facility. At the end of the book, Holly resigns from the LEP. ===In The Lost Colony=== In Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony, Holly is working as a private detective since her resignation from the LEP, along with Mulch Diggums. Though it was not going well and now they are bounty hunters, which are considered even less trustworthy then the criminals they track. Holly is informed about the demon race, a species of fairy that left earth and are now inhabiting an island in Limbo between earth and time, and is recruited to Section Eight, which monitors them. When it becomes apparent that Artemis has encountered a demon, they encounter Minerva Paradizo, another child genius who has managed to obtain a demon, and the deranged Billy Kong. Artemis and Holly, along with two demons, №1 and Qwan, are forced to go to Hybras to save demon civilization. When they arrive back at Artemis and Holly's time, they find that three years have passed in their own dimension. ===In The Time Paradox=== In Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox, Artemis and Holly travel into the past to find the silky sifaka lemur, the only thing that can save Angeline Fowl from death by a fairy disease, Spelltropy. The pair are forced to outwit Artemis's younger self and Damon Kronski, president of the \\"Extinctionists\\" organization. They eventually encounter Opal Koboi, who needs the silky sifaka lemur to increase her own power. In the novel, Holly kisses Artemis, likes it, and quickly attributes it to the effects of time travel as she is now an adolescent fairy. ===In The Atlantis Complex=== In Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex, Artemis is mentally ill; his dabbles with magic have resulted in his developing Atlantis Complex; a fairy disease equivalent to OCD and multiple-personality disorder. Atlantis Complex also gives the victim a large amount of paranoia. He arranges for Holly and her fairy companions to meet him at a glacier in Iceland. Later, however, when Artemis proceeds to demonstrate his invention- a means of curing global warming- outdoors, a hacked martian probe gone rogue descends and attacks the LEP ship on the glacier, killing several marines and Commander Raine Vinyaya, then heads towards Atlantis, the underwater fairy metropolis. Entangled in a conspiracy planned by Holly's old nemesis, the impending crisis and Artemis's rapid deterioration into a soppy alter-ego called Orion who perceives Holly as his 'fair princess' forces Holly to take the lead and find a way to bring back Artemis before it is too late. ===In The Last Guardian=== In Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian, Artemis' condition has improved, with he and Holly having formed a certain friendship with 'Nopal', the near-brain- dead clone of Opal Koboi. When Opal's plan for revenge results in her releasing ancient fairy guardians, Artemis is forced to apparently sacrifice himself and Nopal to stop her, but provides Holly with a sample of his DNA that she can use to clone a new body for his discorporated soul. As the series concludes, Holly is sharing the book's content with Artemis\`s revived but amnesic self. ===In The Fowl Twins=== In The Fowl Twins- a spin-off sequel series focusing on Artemis's younger brothers Myles and Beckett- Holly is revealed to have been promoted to Commodore, and also served as the (initially unknowing, alongside Artemis himself) template for NANNI, an artificial intelligence designed by Artemis to be the twins' guardian in the absence of the senior Fowls. She is also the mentor of Lieutenant Lazuli, a pixie-elf hybrid LEP officer who becomes associated with the Fowl twins during the crisis. At the conclusion of the novel, Lazuli is promoted to the position of head of the Fowl-fairy liaison office to maintain contact with the twins, after it is determined that the magic they retained following their possession by guardian spirits in Last Guardian legally qualifies them as magical creatures under fairy law. ===In film=== In 2001, plans were announced for a film adaptation of Artemis Fowl. Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct and Jeff Stockwell to write. In 2003, Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year but expressed skepticism over whether or not this would come to pass. The film remained in development and was assumed to be in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie, with Saoirse Ronan attached as Holly Short. On December 20, 2017, it was announced that the film, now developed by Walt Disney Pictures and directed by Kenneth Branagh, had cast Lara McDonnell as Holly Short. Upon the film's release on June 12, 2020, the film was criticised for the removal of Short's character arcs from the book series in the film, and for the character being relegated from protagonist to supporting character. McDonnell's casting was additionally criticised as an example of whitewashing due to Short being physically described in the book series as having nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion. ==See also== * Artemis Fowl II * Whitewashing in film ==References== ==things== Category:Artemis Fowl characters Category:Female characters in literature Category:Fictional elves Category:Fictional police officers Category:Fictional private investigators Category:Fictional bounty hunters Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Literary characters introduced in 2001 fr:Personnages de Artemis Fowl#Holly Short ","title":"Holly Short"},{"id":"516339","text":"The 1935 Quebec general election was held on November 25, 1935 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau was re- elected, defeating the Action libérale nationale, led by Paul Gouin, and the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Maurice Duplessis. It was the fourth and final general election victory in a row for Taschereau, who had held office since 1920. He would resign less than seven months later due to a scandal. The Action libérale nationale (ALN) was a newly formed party led by the son of former Liberal premier Lomer Gouin. It was established by former Liberals who had become dissatisfied with the party. The ALN and Conservatives formed an alliance, the Union Nationale, to contest this election, and after the election merged to form the Union Nationale as a fully-fledged party, which soon became a dominant political force. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular Vote - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" align=\\"center\\"1931 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change  Louis-Alexandre Taschereau align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"79 !align=\\"right\\"47 align=\\"right\\"-40.5% align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 46.53% align=\\"right\\"-8.35% Action libérale nationale  Paul Gouin align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"* !align=\\"right\\"25 align=\\"right\\"* align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 29.48% align=\\"right\\"* Conservative  Maurice Duplessis align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 11 !align=\\"right\\" 17 align=\\"right\\" +54.5% align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 18.93% align=\\"right\\" -24.6% colspan=2Other align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"- !align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 5.06% align=\\"right\\"+3.5% - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"90 !align=\\"right\\"89 !align=\\"right\\"-1.1% !align=\\"right\\" !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"right\\" - } Note: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 19th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ","title":"1935 Quebec general election"},{"id":"516341","text":"Xai or XAI may refer to: *Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) *IATA Airport Code for Xinyang Minggang Airport ","title":"Xai"},{"id":"516352","text":"The Nazca Plate or Nasca Plate, named after the Nazca region of southern Peru, is an oceanic tectonic plate in the eastern Pacific Ocean basin off the west coast of South America. The ongoing subduction, along the Peru–Chile Trench, of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate is largely responsible for the Andean orogeny. The Nazca Plate is bounded on the west by the Pacific Plate and to the south by the Antarctic Plate through the East Pacific Rise and the Chile Rise respectively. The movement of the Nazca Plate over several hotspots has created some volcanic islands as well as east-west running seamount chains that subduct under South America. Nazca is a relatively young plate both in terms of the age of its rocks and its existence as an independent plate having been formed from the break-up of the Farallon Plate about 23 million years ago. The oldest rocks of the plate are about 50 million years old. ==BoundariesEast Pacific and Chile Rise=== A triple junction, the Chile Triple Junction, occurs on the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean off Taitao and Tres Montes Peninsula at the southern coast of Chile. Here three tectonic plates meet: the Nazca Plate, the South American Plate, and the Antarctic Plate. ===Peru–Chile Trench=== The eastern margin is a convergent boundary subduction zone under the South American Plate and the Andes Mountains, forming the Peru–Chile Trench. The southern side is a divergent boundary with the Antarctic Plate, the Chile Rise, where seafloor spreading permits magma to rise. The western side is a divergent boundary with the Pacific Plate, forming the East Pacific Rise. The northern side is a divergent boundary with the Cocos Plate, the Galapagos Rise. The subduction of the Nazca plate under southern Chile has a history of producing massive earthquakes, including the largest ever recorded on earth, the moment magnitude 9.5 1960 Valdivia earthquake. ==Intraplate featuresHotspots=== A second triple junction occurs at the northwest corner of the plate where the Nazca, Cocos, and Pacific Plates all join off the coast of Colombia. Yet another triple junction occurs at the southwest corner at the intersection of the Nazca, Pacific, and Antarctic Plates off the coast of southern Chile. At each of these triple junctions an anomalous microplate exists, the Galapagos Microplate at the northern junction and the Juan Fernandez Microplate at the southern junction. The Easter Island Microplate is a third microplate that is located just north of the Juan Fernandez Microplate and lies just west of Easter Island. ===Aseismic ridges=== The Carnegie Ridge is a 1,350-km-long and up to 300-km-wide feature on the ocean floor of the northern Nazca Plate that includes the Galápagos archipelago at its western end. It is being subducted under South America with the rest of the Nazca Plate. ===Fracture zones=== The Darwin Gap is the area between the Nazca Plate and the coast of Chile, where Charles Darwin experienced the earthquake of 1835. It is expected that this area will be the epicenter of a major quake in the near future. ==Plate motion== The absolute motion of the Nazca Plate has been calibrated at 3.7 cm/yr east motion (88°), one of the fastest absolute motions of any tectonic plate. The subducting Nazca Plate, which exhibits unusual flat slab subduction, is tearing as well as deforming as it is subducted (Barzangi and Isacks). The subduction has formed, and continues to form, the volcanic Andes Mountain Range. Deformation of the Nazca Plate even affects the geography of Bolivia, far to the east (Tinker et al.). The 1994 Bolivia earthquake occurred on the Nazca Plate; this had a magnitude of 8.2 M_w, which at that time was the strongest instrumentally recorded earthquake occurring deeper than 300 km. Aside from the Juan Fernández Islands, this area has very few other islands that are affected by the earthquakes that are a result of complicated movements at these junctions. ==Geologic history== The precursor of both the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate (to its north) was the Farallon Plate, which split in the late Oligocene, about 22.8 Mya, a date arrived at by interpreting magnetic anomalies. Subduction under the South American continent began about 140 Mya, although the formation of the high parts of the Central Andes and the Bolivian orocline did not occur until 45 Mya. It has been suggested that the mountains were forced up by the subduction of the older and heavier parts of the plate, which sank more quickly into the mantle. ==See also== *2010 Chile earthquake *Caribbean Plate ==ReferencesBibliography=== *Extreme Science site: \\"A Lesson in Plate tectonics\\" The basics explained. *Galapagos rise junction (map) *Juan Fernandez and Easter microplate (map) *Muawia Barazangi and Bryan L.

In his encyclical Ad Apostolorum principis of 29 July 1958, Pope Pius XII deplored the attitude and activities of the Association and declared the bishops who participated in consecrating new bishops selected by the Association to be excommunicated. Pope Benedict XVI referred to the agents of the Association as people who, though not ordained priests and sometimes not baptized, \\"control and take decisions concerning important ecclesial questions, including the appointment of bishops.\\" The organization is overseen by the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China following the State Administration for Religious Affairs' absorption into the United Front Work Department in 2018. It is the only organizational body of Catholics in China officially recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China, but is not recognized by the Vatican. Nonetheless, the Holy See distinguishes between the Church in China and the CPCA as such, and since the 1980s has recognized nearly all CPCA-appointed bishops as legitimate and in full communion with the Catholic Church, albeit on an individual basis. The Church continues to seek a permanent settlement of the question through negotiations with the political authorities of the People's Republic. The CPCA does not oversee Catholics in Macau and Hong Kong, whose bishops retain ties to the Catholic Church in Rome. ==CPCA and the Beijing government== Officially, religious organizations in mainland China today must be government-recognized and approved, though many unofficial unregistered organizations do exist. The Government of China wants no organization in mainland China owing allegiance to \\"foreign influence\\", in this case, the Pope in Rome. Critics of the CPCA argue that it was created precisely to establish state control over Catholicism in mainland China. The government rejects exercise of any authority by organs of the Catholic Church outside China after 1949, the year communists gained power over all of mainland China. CPCA, which was founded eight years later, thus does not recognize the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Pope Pius XII in 1950, canonizations from 1949 onward (e.g. the canonization of Pope Pius X), Vatican declarations on even well-established devotional piety (e.g. on the Sacred Heart of Jesus or on Mary as Queen), and the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). In practice, however, the Catholic Church in China uses Chinese translations of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, of the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church (revised in 1997) and of the 1970 Roman Missal. These had at first to be imported from Taiwan and Hong Kong, but have been printed locally for some years. Due to CPCA pressure, Mass continued for some years after Pope Paul VI's 1969 revision of the Roman Missal to be celebrated in mainland China in the Tridentine Mass form, and for lack of the revised text in Latin or Chinese, even priests who refused any connection with the CPCA kept the older form. As the effects of the Cultural Revolution faded in the 1980s, the Mass of Paul VI began to be used, and at the beginning of the next decade the CPCA officially permitted the publication even locally of texts, originally prepared in Taiwan, that brought the Mass liturgy into line with that in use in other countries. Since the Canon of the Mass is now said aloud, observers have been able to check that the Pope is prayed for by name (a traditional test of unity and loyalty) even by those priests who, at least externally, accept directions from the CPCA, leading to the conclusion that \\"there is only one Catholic Church in China, whether state-recognized or so-called underground, they have the same faith, and the same doctrine.\\" The policy of the PRC government, as was that of communist governments in other countries, has been to reserve to the state the regulation of all social activities. Thus the CPCA prevents the Catholic bishops in China from speaking out publicly even against laws that gravely contravene official Catholic moral teaching, such as those allowing abortion and artificial contraception. ==CPCA and the Catholic Church== The Vatican has never declared the Chinese Catholics attending CPCA-sponsored church services to be schismatic, though organizations outside of China have urged this. Chinese Catholics who accept CPCA directives on the governance of the Church are not for that reason heretical, though it can perhaps be maintained that they are schismatic. Even if some Chinese Catholics were considered to have accepted as their belief the approval of abortion and artificial contraception that has been attributed to the CPCA, their position could be compared with that of certain Catholics in other countries who adopt that approval as their personal belief. In, for instance, inviting bishops appointed under CPCA rules to attend as Catholics in full communion with Rome an assembly of the Synod of Bishops, the Holy See indicated that it does not consider that the Church in mainland China (as distinct from the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association) approves of abortion and artificial contraception. Furthermore, \\"[t]he Holy See has continued to consider the episcopal ordinations in China fully valid.\\" The clergy whom they ordain therefore conserve valid Holy Orders, and the other sacraments that require a priest as minister (in particular the Eucharist) are also considered valid. As these facts demonstrate, the CPCA and the \\"underground\\" Catholic Church in China have significant overlap. See drop-down essay on \\"An Era of Opening\\" The bishops who conferred episcopal ordination on candidates chosen in the manner laid down by the CPCA, without a mandate from the Holy See, and those who accepted such ordination, participated in a schismatic act and were thereby automatically excommunicated. However, not all of them are considered to be still in schism since, beginning in the early 1980s, nearly all \\"took advantage of the renewed contacts with missionaries and foreign priests to send letters to Rome in which they declared their full communion with the Pope and the desire to be recognized as legitimate bishops. So ... the bishops subjected to the political control of the Patriotic Association tried the path of canonical sanatio to ... affirm their communion with the Pope, kept hidden because of external conditions, but never renounced in their hearts.\\" Those few Chinese bishops who have not done so remain in formal schism. For a time, some bishops who refused to accept CPCA control consecrated other bishops, so that there were cases of two parallel hierarchies among Catholics in China, the one in schism partly, the other in full communion with Pope Pius XII and his successors. The first to take this action was the Bishop of Baoding, Joseph Fan Xueyan, who in 1981 consecrated three bishops without any mandate from the Holy See, which, however, gave approval for his action at the end of the same year. This led to at least the perception, perhaps even the reality, of two parallel Roman Catholic Churches in China, often referred to as the \\"official\\" Church and the \\"underground\\" one. It was precisely in that period that bishops ordained according to CPCA rules began to request and obtain recognition from the Holy See. On 26 September 1993 the Holy See decided that no more episcopal ordinations of the kind administered by Bishop Fan without previous authorization by the Holy See would be allowed. It was also decided that, given the greater ease of communication then existing, bishops selected by CPCA procedures were likewise to request and receive the prior approval of the Holy See before ordination, and must seek to have as consecrants legitimate bishops, since \\"the active participation of illegitimate bishops cannot but make more difficult the acceptance of a subsequent request for regularization.\\" They were also to make public, when they deemed it possible and opportune, the assent of the Holy See to their ordination. Some have actually made this public on the occasion of their ordination as bishops. In September 1992, the CPCA-sponsored Conference of Chinese Catholic Representatives, in which the bishops were a minority, approved new statutes of the Bishops' College, which seemed to subject the college to the Conference and to reiterate the CPCA rules for the election of bishops and the replacement, in the rite of episcopal ordination, of the papal mandate with the consent of the college. Probably because of this, the September 1993 directives also exhorted the bishops to defend with greater courage \\"the rights of the Church and communion with the Roman Pontiff.\\" And, in fact, the bishops claimed more strongly at the next Assembly of the Catholic Representatives, held in January 1998, leadership in church matters. The ordinations of Peter Feng Xinmao in 2004 as coadjutor of Hengsui, Joseph Xing Wenzhi as auxiliary of Shanghai on 28 June 2005 and Anthony Dang Ming Yan as coadjutor of Xian on 26 July of the same year were all papal appointments, which were followed by the government-imposed procedures of the appointee's election by representatives of the diocese and consequent approval by the Chinese government itself. The Holy See refrained from making any statement, and no papal document of appointment was read at the ordination rites. However, it was noted that at least Bishop Xing swore to be \\"faithful to the one, holy, catholic, apostolic Church, with Peter as its head.\\" In a further highly significant gesture, Pope Benedict XVI invited three CPCA-appointed bishops, together along with one \\"underground\\" bishop, to the October 2005 assembly of the Synod of Bishops as full members, not as \\"fraternal delegates\\", the term used for representatives of non-Catholic churches invited to attend. Government permission for them to travel to Rome was withheld. The Vatican stated that it had given its prior approval for the episcopal ordination of two CPCA-approved bishops in September 2007, and the Rome-based missionary news service AsiaNews, which follows events in China closely, quoted a Chinese source as saying the government was no longer imposing its own candidates as bishops and was now allowing the church more freedom. ==Effects on China–Holy See relations== The existence and activities of the CPCA division of the Government's Religious Affairs Bureau has prevented the Holy See from establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. On the part of the Holy See, a normal condition for establishing diplomatic relations with a country is a satisfactory level of freedom of religion, a condition whose fulfilment in China is subject to debate. However, the same condition could be seen as not required for appointing a papal representative, resident in Beijing, to continue, after an interruption, the diplomatic relations established with China in the 1930s. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine that the Holy See would agree to this without some loosening of the governmental ban on religious links between Catholics in China and Rome. At the time of the definitive Communist victory in mainland China, the papal diplomatic representative did not move to Taiwan, the island to which the Nationalist government withdrew. This fact might have made it possible to continue diplomatic relations with the new government as regularly happens when a country's government is changed by election, coup, revolution or overthrow by rebel forces. Instead, the Communist government expelled the papal representative, whose delay in leaving then made him unacceptable to the Taipei government. His successors were accepted, and maintained relations with the government that at that time was still recognized by the United Nations as the government of China. When the United Nations gave recognition instead to the Beijing government, the Holy See decided to appoint no further heads of its diplomatic mission in Taipei, leaving it from then on in the care of a chargé d'affaires. Due to One-China policy, Beijing has several times declared that, in the case of the Holy See, a break with Taipei is a necessary preliminary condition to establish diplomatic relations. There have been a number of efforts to reconcile the PRC government with the Vatican. An article in The New York Times estimated that the status of Taiwan is not a major obstacle, and appointment of bishops can be handled with the Vatican picking from a list pre-screened by the government. Most reports, it said, indicate that the main obstacle is the PRC government's fear of being undermined by the Catholic Church, especially since Pope John Paul II was widely seen as having influenced the fall of Communist governments in Poland and other Eastern European countries. Some observers have described a difference in the phenomena of civil society and state-society relations between China and the Western world. As a result, what Westerners may see as state regulation of social activities, the PRC government often describes as necessary policies to preserve social stability. When Pope John Paul II died in 2005, churches throughout China held special memorial services to commemorate and mourn his passing. Such activities are permitted, though official policy toward the Pope in Rome remain the same. Many Chinese Catholics, often with no awareness of any real rift between the two sides, expressed that they would have liked him to visit China, as he had once indicated was his desire. The PRC government also expresses its view that the Catholic Church has not sufficiently apologized for alleged abuses by missionaries and clergy which occurred prior to the establishment of the PRC, some of them, it says, substantiated by international scrutiny. It harshly criticized the canonization in 2000 of 120 Chinese and foreign martyrs in China, beatified much earlier, claiming that many of the non-Chinese among the martyrs had perpetrated abuses and crimes against the Chinese people. It also criticized the Vatican for proceeding with this action without securing Chinese input, and put on the Holy See the blame for the non-existence of the diplomatic channels that would have facilitated input. It made a similar accusation of Holy See unilateralism (which some would interpret instead as Beijing's refusal to distinguish between religion and politics) when Pope Benedict XVI invited four bishops from mainland China – three of whom were government-approved – to the October 2005 assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome. ==Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to Catholics in China== In his letter of 27 May 2007 to the Catholics in the People's Republic of China, Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged their faithfulness to Christ and the Church, \\"sometimes at the price of grave sufferings\\", but also expressed concern at some aspects of ecclesial life in the country, in particular the division caused by \\"the significant part played by entities that have been imposed as the principal determinants of the life of the Catholic community\\", so that \\"persons who are not ordained, and sometimes not even baptized, control and take decisions concerning important ecclesial questions, including the appointment of Bishops, in the name of various State agencies\\", with a consequent \\"demeaning of the Petrine and episcopal ministries\\". The Pope distinguished three groups among the Catholic bishops in China. He first mentioned those who \\"have felt themselves constrained to opt for clandestine consecration\\"; he expressed the Holy See's hope \\"that these legitimate Pastors may be recognized as such by governmental authorities for civil effects too\\". The second group is that of those who, \\"under the pressure of particular circumstances, have consented to receive episcopal ordination without the pontifical mandate, but have subsequently asked to be received into communion with the Successor of Peter and with their other brothers in the episcopate\\"; in view of the existing confusion on the part of Chinese Catholics, the Pope said: \\"It is indispensable, for the spiritual good of the diocesan communities concerned, that legitimation, once it has occurred, is brought into the public domain at the earliest opportunity, and that the legitimized Bishops provide unequivocal and increasing signs of full communion with the Successor of Peter.\\" The third group is that of the \\"very small number ... who have been ordained without the Pontifical mandate and who have not asked for, or have not yet obtained, the necessary legitimation\\"; these, the Pope said, \\"are to be considered illegitimate, but validly ordained\\", and \\"the faithful, taking this into account, where the eucharistic celebration and the other sacraments are concerned, must, within the limits of the possible, seek Bishops and priests who are in communion with the Pope: nevertheless, where this cannot be achieved without grave inconvenience, they may, for the sake of their spiritual good, turn also to those who are not in communion with the Pope.\\" == Hardening of government's attitude == The 20 November 2010 ordination of a bishop against the wishes of the Holy See indicated that the government was taking a more hard-line attitude. Pope Benedict XVI expressed his concern firmly. At the end of June 2011, another bishop was ordained against the wishes of the Holy See, while a priest with Holy See approval was arrested, so preventing his ordination as a bishop. A similar ordination took place on 14 July 2011, causing the Holy See to issue a declaration that the Pope \\"once again deplores the manner in which the Church in China is being treated and hopes that the present difficulties can be overcome as soon as possible\\". ==Other state-endorsed religious organizations== CPCA is one of three state- endorsed religious organizations set up in China after 1949. The other two are the Three-Self Patriotic Movement for Protestants, and the Islamic Association of China. ==See also== *Underground church *Religion in China *Christianity in China *Catholic Church in China *Chinese Catholic Bishops Conference *Catholic Church in Macau and Catholic Church in Hong Kong *Separation of church and state ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * *Website about Chinese Christianity today *The Cardinal Kung Foundation's definition of Catholicism in China *Ad Apostolorum Principis Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XII regarding the Church in China *Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to Catholics in the People's Republic of China Category:Christian organizations established in 1957 Category:Catholicism in China Category:Government of China Category:Patriotism Category:1957 establishments in China Category:Independent Catholic denominations Category:Organizations associated with the Communist Party of China ","title":"Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association"},{"id":"516369","text":"The 1931 Quebec general election was held on August 24, 1931 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.

Fluorescein is a fluorophore commonly used in microscopy, in a type of dye laser as the gain medium, in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494 nm and emission maximum of 512 nm (in water). The major derivatives are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite. The color of its aqueous solution varies from green to orange as a function of the way it is observed: by reflection or by transmission, as can be noticed in bubble levels, for example, in which fluorescein is added as a colorant to the alcohol filling the tube in order to increase the visibility of the air bubble contained within (thus enhancing the precision of the instrument). More concentrated solutions of fluorescein can even appear red. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. ==UsesBiochemical research=== In cellular biology, the isothiocyanate derivative of fluorescein is often used to label and track cells in fluorescence microscopy applications (for example, flow cytometry). Additional biologically active molecules (such as antibodies) may also be attached to fluorescein, allowing biologists to target the fluorophore to specific proteins or structures within cells. This application is common in yeast display. Fluorescein can also be conjugated to nucleoside triphosphates and incorporated into a probe enzymatically for in situ hybridisation. The use of fluorescein amidite, shown below right, allows one to synthesize labeled oligonucleotides for the same purpose. Yet another technique termed molecular beacons makes use of synthetic fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. Fluorescein-labelled probes can be imaged using FISH, or targeted by antibodies using immunohistochemistry. The latter is a common alternative to digoxigenin, and the two are used together for labelling two genes in one sample. ===Medical use=== Fluorescein drops being instilled for an eye examination Fluorescein sodium, the sodium salt of fluorescein, is used extensively as a diagnostic tool in the field of ophthalmology and optometry, where topical fluorescein is used in the diagnosis of corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers and herpetic corneal infections. It is also used in rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting to evaluate the tear layer under the lens. It is available as sterile single-use sachets containing lint-free paper applicators soaked in fluorescein sodium. Intravenous or oral fluorescein is used in fluorescein angiography in research and to diagnose and categorize vascular disorders including retinal disease macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors. It is also being used increasingly during surgery for brain tumors. Diluted fluorescein dye has been used to localise multiple muscular ventricular septal defects during open heart surgery and confirm the presence of any residual defects. The Gemini 4 spacecraft releases dye into the water, to aid location after splashdown, June 1965. ===Earth sciences=== Fluorescein is used as a rather conservative flow tracer in hydrological tracer tests to help in understanding of water flow of both surface waters and groundwater. The dye can also be added to rainwater in environmental testing simulations to aid in locating and analyzing any water leaks, and in Australia and New Zealand as a methylated spirit dye. As fluorescein solution changes its color depending on concentration, it has been used as a tracer in evaporation experiments. One of its more recognizable uses was in the Chicago River, where fluorescein was the first substance used to dye the river green on St. Patrick's Day in 1962. In 1966, environmentalists forced a change to a vegetable-based dye to protect local wildlife.The Story Behind Dyeing the River Green. Greenchicagoriver.com. Retrieved on 2014-08-28. === Plant science === Fluorescein has often been used to track water movement in groundwater to study water flow and observe areas of contamination or obstruction in these systems. The fluorescence that is created by the dye makes problem areas more visible and easily identified. A similar concept can be applied to plants because the dye can make problems in plant vasculature more visible. In plant science, fluorescein, and other fluorescent dyes, have been used to monitor and study plant vasculature, particularly the xylem, which is the main water transportation pathway in plants. This is because fluorescein is xylem-mobile and unable to cross plasma membranes, making it particularly useful in tracking water movement through the xylem. Fluorescein can be introduced to a plant's veins through the roots or a cut stem. The dye is able to be taken up into the plant the same way as water and moves from the roots to the top of the plant due to a transpirational pull. The fluorescein that has been taken up into the plant can be visualized under a fluorescent microscope. ===Oilfield application=== Fluorescein dye solutions, typically 15% active, are commonly used as an aid to leak detection during hydrostatic testing of subsea oil and gas pipelines and other subsea infrastructure. Leaks can be detected by divers carrying an ultraviolet light. ===Cosmetics=== Fluorescein is also known as a color additive (D&C; Yellow no. 7). The disodium salt form of fluorescein is known as uranine or D&C; Yellow no. 8. ==Safety== Topical, oral, and intravenous use of fluorescein can cause adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, hives, acute hypotension, anaphylaxis and related anaphylactoid reaction,The diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis: an updated practice parameter. National Guideline Clearinghouse. causing cardiac arrest and sudden death due to anaphylactic shock. The most common adverse reaction is nausea, due to a difference in the pH from the body and the pH of the sodium fluorescein dye; a number of other factors, however, are considered contributors as well. The nausea usually is transient and subsides quickly. Hives can range from a minor annoyance to severe, and a single dose of antihistamine may give complete relief. Anaphylactic shock and subsequent cardiac arrest and sudden death are very rare, but because they occur within minutes, a health care provider who uses fluorescein should be prepared to perform emergency resuscitation. Intravenous use has the most reported adverse reactions, including sudden death, but this may reflect greater use rather than greater risk. Both oral and topical uses have been reported to cause anaphylaxis, including one case of anaphylaxis with cardiac arrest (resuscitated) following topical use in an eye drop. Reported rates of adverse reactions vary from 1% to 6%. The higher rates may reflect study populations that include a higher percentage of persons with prior adverse reactions. The risk of an adverse reaction is 25 times higher if the person has had a prior adverse reaction. The risk can be reduced with prior (prophylactic) use of antihistamines and prompt emergency management of any ensuing anaphylaxis. A simple prick test may help to identify persons at greatest risk of adverse reaction. ==Chemistry== UV illumination Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of fluorescein The fluorescence of this molecule is very intense; peak excitation occurs at 494 nm and peak emission at 521 nm. Fluorescein has a pKa of 6.4, and its ionization equilibrium leads to pH-dependent absorption and emission over the range of 5 to 9. Also, the fluorescence lifetimes of the protonated and deprotonated forms of fluorescein are approximately 3 and 4 ns, which allows for pH determination from nonintensity based measurements. The lifetimes can be recovered using time-correlated single photon counting or phase-modulation fluorimetry. Fluorescein has an isosbestic point (equal absorption for all pH values) at 460 nm. ==Derivatives== Fluorescein isothiocyanate and 6-FAM phosphoramidite Many derivatives of fluorescein are known. Example *fluorescein isothiocyanate 1, often abbreviated as FITC, features an isothiocyanate group (−N=C=S) substituent. FITC reacts with the amine groups of many biologically relevant compounds including intracellular proteins to form a thiourea linkage. *succinimidyl ester modified fluorescein, i.e. NHS- fluorescein, is another common amine-reactive derivative, yielding amide adducts that are more stable than the aforementioned thioureas. *Others: carboxyfluorescein, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, Pentafluorophenyl esters (PFP), tetrafluorophenyl esters (TFP) are other useful reagents. In oligonucleotide synthesis, several phosphoramidite reagents containing protected fluorescein, e.g. 6-FAM phosphoramidite 2,Brush, C. K. \\"Fluorescein Labelled Phosphoramidites\\". . Priority date July 19, 1991. are used for the preparation of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. Other green dyes include Oregon Green, Tokyo Green, SNAFL, and carboxynaphthofluorescein. These dyes, along with newer fluorophores such as Alexa 488, FluoProbes 488 and DyLight 488, have been tailored for various chemical and biological applications where higher photostability, different spectral characteristics, or different attachment groups are needed. The extent to which fluorescein dilaurate is broken down to yield lauric acid can be detected as a measure of pancreatic esterase activity. ==Synthesis== Fluorescein was first synthesized by Adolf von Baeyer in 1871.Baeyer, Adolf (1871) \\"Uber ein neue Klasse von Farbstoffen\\" (On a new class of dyes), Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin, 4 : 555-558 ; see p. 558. It can be prepared from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol in the presence of zinc chloride via the Friedel-Crafts reaction. 500px A second method to prepare fluorescein uses methanesulfonic acid as a Brønsted acid catalyst. This route has a high yield under milder conditions. ==See also== *Chemical derivatives of fluorescein: **Eosin **Calcein **Fluorescein amidite (FAM) **Merbromin **Erythrosine **Rose bengal **DyLight Fluor, a product line of fluorescent dyes *Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, a biochemistry laboratory test *Other dyes: **Methylene blue **Laser dyes ==References== ==External links== *Absorption and Emission Spectra of Fluorescein in Ethanol and Basic Ethanol at OGI School of Science and Engineering *Fluorescein Ionization Equilibria at Invitrogen *Absorption spectra and fluorescence emission spectra Category:Benzoic acids Category:Fluorone dyes Category:Laser gain media Category:Maritime signalling Category:Phenols Category:Staining dyes Category:Triarylmethane dyes Category:Vinylogous carboxylic acids ","title":"Fluorescein"},{"id":"516379","text":"The 1927 Quebec general election was held on May 16, 1927 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.

Part of the Toronto waterfront, Harbourfront extends from Bathurst Street in the west, along Queens Quay, with its ill-defined eastern boundary being either Yonge Street or York Street. Its northern boundary is the Gardiner Expressway. Much of the district was former water lots filled in during the early 1900s to create a larger harbour district. After shipping patterns changed and the use of the Toronto harbour declined, the area was converted from industrial uses to a mixed-use district that is mostly residential and leisure. ==History== View of the Harbourfront in 1841. The area surrounding the Toronto Harbour has been used for shipping and industrial purposes since the settlement of York. Toronto's harbour has been used since the founding of Toronto for shipping and industrial purposes. The Town of York was founded to the west of the Don River, along the waterfront. When the town was founded, the water's edge was approximately where today's 'Front Street' is located. Over time, the area south of Front Street to today's water's edge south of 'Queen's Quay' was filled in with landfill, creating piers and area for industrial development. Prior to the 1972 federal election, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau announced the Harbourfront project, which would expropriate the industrial port lands from York Street west to Bathurst Street, south of Queen's Quay and convert them to a cultural and residential district for Toronto, similar to the Granville Island district in Vancouver. The federal government has converted the industrial area to an area mixed with art galleries, performance spaces, boating areas and parks. The surrounding neighbourhood, formerly industrial has been converted by private land developers into a series of condominium towers overlooking the project and Lake Ontario. Harbourfront Centre was formed in 1991 in an effort to create a waterfront park in Toronto. From its beginnings as \\"Harbourfront Corporation\\", a federal Crown Corporation established in 1972, Harbourfront Centre was formed on January 1, 1991 as a non-profit charitable organization with a mandate to organize and present public events and to operate a site encompassing York Quay and John Quay (south of Queens Quay West). Since its inception, Harbourfront Centre has been used by artists that would not normally be seen in commercial venues, in an effort to foster new forms of arts and expression. In July 2012 Waterfront Toronto began a major reconstruction of Queen's Quay West, requiring the 509 streetcar to be replaced with buses for the duration of the construction. On October 12, 2014, streetcar service resumed on 509 Harbourfront route after an absence of over two years in order to rebuild the street to a new design. With the new street design, two auto lanes south of the streetcar tracks were eliminated between Spadina Avenue and York Street in order to extend Harbourfront parkland to the edge of the streetcar tracks. The Martin Goodman Trail (a bicycle path), two rows of trees, benches and a wider pedestrian space are located on the immediate south side of the streetcar tracks. ==Character== federal government, at Harbourfront. The area along the waterfront is composed of mixed uses. The federal government lands to the south of Queen's Quay include a community centre, a Toronto fire department station, various boating uses, parkland and the Harbourfront Centre. To the north of Queen's Quay, all of the industrial lands along the street have been replaced with high-rise condominium towers. To the east of the federal government lands, the waterfront is mixed with industrial uses, a hotel, ferry docks, boating uses, a sugar factory and vacant lands. ===Neighbourhood issues=== The neighbourhood is separated from the rest of downtown Toronto by the elevated Gardiner Expressway. A project to link Lower Simcoe with Simcoe St. via tunnel has been completed to provide a new link between Harbourfront and downtown, though access between the waterfront and the core remains an issue. Proposals have been made to demolish the Expressway in the area. One proposal was to demolish the highway east of Spadina Avenue. Another proposal, to demolish the highway from the Don River to Jarvis Street is being actively studied by the City of Toronto. The Toronto Island Airport is another neighbourhood issue. The airport, located to the south-west of the neighbourhood, is opposed by local community groups and some city politicians, including Toronto's past mayor, David Miller, as an impediment to the waterfront lands redevelopment. Toronto's former mayor, Rob Ford, on the other hand, backed an expansion of the airport, as it created jobs. The airport, built in the 1930s, is utilized for regional air travel. The airport generates hundreds of noise complaints monthly to its operator, the Toronto Port Authority. The Toronto Port Authority confirmed on September 12, 2008, that Porter Airlines was fined for breaking noise curfews in its operations at the Island Airport. A study by the Port Authority is being conducted into reducing noise from Porter's takeoffs and landings. ==Notable buildings and facilities== Jack Layton Ferry Terminal is located at the shoreline of Harbourfront. Harbourfront is the site of the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal which provides transportation services to the Toronto Islands from the foot of Bay Street. Captain John's Harbour Boat Restaurant was also a ship moored at the Yonge Street slip and removed in 2015. Toronto Maritime Museum was relocated from Exhibition Place in 1997, but closed in 2003. Harbourfront Centre, housing galleries and performance spaces is located at the foot of Lower Simcoe Street. Harbourfront houses four craft studios; ceramics, glass, metal and textiles. All studios began in 1974 and still operate, providing new craft artists with subsidized work spaces at the beginning of their careers. Harbourfront hosts an extensive program of arts and cultural events throughout each summer, including craft and artisan fairs, theatre and dance performances and musical concerts. A series of free concerts is staged at Harbourfront's outdoor concert stage every weekend throughout the summer and in winter there is a free open-air ice rink. Queen's Quay Terminal is a former warehouse that was converted into a mixed-used building. Queen's Quay Terminal, next to Harbourfront Centre, is a former warehouse converted into a mixed-use building including a shopping centre designed for high-end retailers, commercial office space, and a residential condominium development. Today, the mall houses some stores and restaurants, predominantly catering to tourists. The Canada Malting Silos along the waterfront at the western edge of Harbourfront, are one of the last vestiges of the industrial past of the neighbourhood. The buildings were long ago abandoned by the company that built them, but a proposal for demolition was cancelled when the estimated cost for demolition rose into the millions of dollars. The site is also now considered a heritage site, and any development must conserve some aspect of the industrial past. Two proposals have been made, a Canadian music museum and a Toronto history museum have both been proposed for the site. Both proposals keep the silos, but demolish other buildings on the site. The silos are one two remaining silos in the area (see Victory Soya Mills Silos) and reminder of the past uses of the area. To the south of the Silos, Toronto Ireland Park was inaugurated in 2004. The site has memorials to an 1878 exodus of Irish persons to Toronto. To the east of Harbourfront, at the foot of Jarvis Street is the Redpath Sugar Refinery, which is both an active sugar refinery and a sugar production museum. ==Parks and open spaces== Although Toronto has often been criticized for not having a dynamic and beautiful waterfront park, Harbourfront has a network of parks, open spaces and trails that allow residents and visitors to access the public realm. Parks and public spaces like HTO Park, the Martin Goodman Trail, the Yo-Yo Ma Music Garden, and the Waterfront WaveDecks at the foots of Spadina Avenue, Rees Street and Lower Simcoe combine to beautify the harbourfront and bring people to the water's edge. HTO Park is one of several parks located along Harbourfront. ===List of parks and open spaces=== * Harbourfront - Water's Edge * HTO Park * Ireland Park * John Quay * John Quay North * Harbour Square Park * Martin Goodman Trail/Waterfront Trail * Maple Leaf Quay East—former site of Maple Leaf Mills Silos * Maple Leaf Quay West * Rees WaveDeck * Simcoe WaveDeck * Toronto Music Garden * Spadina WaveDeck * York Quay & Harbourfront Centre * Martin Goodman Trail/Waterfront Trail ==Transportation== The area is served by the Toronto streetcar system. The area is served by streetcar links with Union, Spadina, and Bathurst subway stations. The 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront streetcar routes terminate at Union Station, travel underground along Bay Street, and surface through in the centre ROW lane on Queens Quay west. The streetcar route travels along Queen's Quay in a separate right-of-way, either to the CNE grounds, up to Spadina or to Bathurst, depending on day of the week and other factors. The area is accessible from the Spadina Avenue, Yonge/Bay and Jarvis street off-ramps of the Gardiner Expressway. Toronto Island Ferry operates from the City/Bay Street Docks at the foot of Bay Street (all ferries excluding Trillium) and Yonge Street slip (Trillium). ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Neighbourhoods in Toronto Category:Parks in Toronto Category:Culture of Toronto Category:Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in Toronto ","title":"Harbourfront, Toronto"},{"id":"516386","text":"mercury Fluorescence spectroscopy (also known as fluorimetry or spectrofluorometry) is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light; typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. In the special case of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, intensity fluctuations from the emitted light are measured from either single fluorophores, or pairs of fluorophores. Devices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers. ==Theory== Molecules have various states referred to as energy levels. Fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states. Generally, the species being examined has a ground electronic state (a low energy state) of interest, and an excited electronic state of higher energy. Within each of these electronic states there are various vibrational states.Animation for the principle of fluorescence and UV-visible absorbance In fluorescence, the species is first excited, by absorbing a photon, from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state. Collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state from the excited electronic state. This process is often visualized with a Jablonski diagram. The molecule then drops down to one of the various vibrational levels of the ground electronic state again, emitting a photon in the process. As molecules may drop down into any of several vibrational levels in the ground state, the emitted photons will have different energies, and thus frequencies. Therefore, by analysing the different frequencies of light emitted in fluorescent spectroscopy, along with their relative intensities, the structure of the different vibrational levels can be determined. For atomic species, the process is similar; however, since atomic species do not have vibrational energy levels, the emitted photons are often at the same wavelength as the incident radiation. This process of re- emitting the absorbed photon is \\"resonance fluorescence\\" and while it is characteristic of atomic fluorescence, is seen in molecular fluorescence as well.Principles Of Instrumental Analysis F.James Holler, Douglas A. Skoog & Stanley R. Crouch 2006 In a typical fluorescence (emission) measurement, the excitation wavelength is fixed and the detection wavelength varies, while in a fluorescence excitation measurement the detection wavelength is fixed and the excitation wavelength is varied across a region of interest. An emission map is measured by recording the emission spectra resulting from a range of excitation wavelengths and combining them all together. This is a three dimensional surface data set: emission intensity as a function of excitation and emission wavelengths, and is typically depicted as a contour map. == Instrumentation == Two general types of instruments exist: filter fluorometers that use filters to isolate the incident light and fluorescent light and spectrofluorometers that use a diffraction grating monochromators to isolate the incident light and fluorescent light. Both types use the following scheme: the light from an excitation source passes through a filter or monochromator, and strikes the sample. A proportion of the incident light is absorbed by the sample, and some of the molecules in the sample fluoresce. The fluorescent light is emitted in all directions. Some of this fluorescent light passes through a second filter or monochromator and reaches a detector, which is usually placed at 90° to the incident light beam to minimize the risk of transmitted or reflected incident light reaching the detector. A simplistic design of the components of a fluorimeter Various light sources may be used as excitation sources, including lasers, LED, and lamps; xenon arcs and mercury- vapor lamps in particular. A laser only emits light of high irradiance at a very narrow wavelength interval, typically under 0.01 nm, which makes an excitation monochromator or filter unnecessary. The disadvantage of this method is that the wavelength of a laser cannot be changed by much. A mercury vapor lamp is a line lamp, meaning it emits light near peak wavelengths. By contrast, a xenon arc has a continuous emission spectrum with nearly constant intensity in the range from 300-800 nm and a sufficient irradiance for measurements down to just above 200 nm. Filters and/or monochromators may be used in fluorimeters. A monochromator transmits light of an adjustable wavelength with an adjustable tolerance. The most common type of monochromator utilizes a diffraction grating, that is, collimated light illuminates a grating and exits with a different angle depending on the wavelength. The monochromator can then be adjusted to select which wavelengths to transmit. For allowing anisotropy measurements, the addition of two polarization filters is necessary: One after the excitation monochromator or filter, and one before the emission monochromator or filter. As mentioned before, the fluorescence is most often measured at a 90° angle relative to the excitation light. This geometry is used instead of placing the sensor at the line of the excitation light at a 180° angle in order to avoid interference of the transmitted excitation light. No monochromator is perfect and it will transmit some stray light, that is, light with other wavelengths than the targeted. An ideal monochromator would only transmit light in the specified range and have a high wavelength-independent transmission. When measuring at a 90° angle, only the light scattered by the sample causes stray light. This results in a better signal-to-noise ratio, and lowers the detection limit by approximately a factor 10000,Rendell, D. (1987). Fluorescence and Phosphorescence. Crown when compared to the 180° geometry. Furthermore, the fluorescence can also be measured from the front, which is often done for turbid or opaque samples . The detector can either be single-channeled or multichanneled. The single- channeled detector can only detect the intensity of one wavelength at a time, while the multichanneled detects the intensity of all wavelengths simultaneously, making the emission monochromator or filter unnecessary. The different types of detectors have both advantages and disadvantages. The most versatile fluorimeters with dual monochromators and a continuous excitation light source can record both an excitation spectrum and a fluorescence spectrum. When measuring fluorescence spectra, the wavelength of the excitation light is kept constant, preferably at a wavelength of high absorption, and the emission monochromator scans the spectrum. For measuring excitation spectra, the wavelength passing through the emission filter or monochromator is kept constant and the excitation monochromator is scanning. The excitation spectrum generally is identical to the absorption spectrum as the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the absorption. ==Analysis of data== GNU R export from OpenChrom OpenFluor plugin in OpenChrom showing substance matchings At low concentrations the fluorescence intensity will generally be proportional to the concentration of the fluorophore. Unlike in UV/visible spectroscopy, ‘standard’, device independent spectra are not easily attained. Several factors influence and distort the spectra, and corrections are necessary to attain ‘true’, i.e. machine-independent, spectra. The different types of distortions will here be classified as being either instrument- or sample-related. Firstly, the distortion arising from the instrument is discussed. As a start, the light source intensity and wavelength characteristics varies over time during each experiment and between each experiment. Furthermore, no lamp has a constant intensity at all wavelengths. To correct this, a beam splitter can be applied after the excitation monochromator or filter to direct a portion of the light to a reference detector. Additionally, the transmission efficiency of monochromators and filters must be taken into account. These may also change over time. The transmission efficiency of the monochromator also varies depending on wavelength. This is the reason that an optional reference detector should be placed after the excitation monochromator or filter. The percentage of the fluorescence picked up by the detector is also dependent upon the system. Furthermore, the detector quantum efficiency, that is, the percentage of photons detected, varies between different detectors, with wavelength and with time, as the detector inevitably deteriorates. Two other topics that must be considered include the optics used to direct the radiation and the means of holding or containing the sample material (called a cuvette or cell). For most UV, visible, and NIR measurements the use of precision quartz cuvettes is necessary. In both cases, it is important to select materials that have relatively little absorption in the wavelength range of interest. Quartz is ideal because it transmits from 200 nm-2500 nm; higher grade quartz can even transmit up to 3500 nm, whereas the absorption properties of other materials can mask the fluorescence from the sample. Correction of all these instrumental factors for getting a ‘standard’ spectrum is a tedious process, which is only applied in practice when it is strictly necessary. This is the case when measuring the quantum yield or when finding the wavelength with the highest emission intensity for instance. As mentioned earlier, distortions arise from the sample as well. Therefore, some aspects of the sample must be taken into account too. Firstly, photodecomposition may decrease the intensity of fluorescence over time. Scattering of light must also be taken into account. The most significant types of scattering in this context are Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Light scattered by Rayleigh scattering has the same wavelength as the incident light, whereas in Raman scattering the scattered light changes wavelength usually to longer wavelengths. Raman scattering is the result of a virtual electronic state induced by the excitation light. From this virtual state, the molecules may relax back to a vibrational level other than the vibrational ground state.Gauglitz, G. and Vo-Dinh, T. (2003). Handbook of spectroscopy. Wiley-VCH. In fluorescence spectra, it is always seen at a constant wavenumber difference relative to the excitation wavenumber e.g. the peak appears at a wavenumber 3600 cm−1 lower than the excitation light in water. Other aspects to consider are the inner filter effects. These include reabsorption. Reabsorption happens because another molecule or part of a macromolecule absorbs at the wavelengths at which the fluorophore emits radiation. If this is the case, some or all of the photons emitted by the fluorophore may be absorbed again. Another inner filter effect occurs because of high concentrations of absorbing molecules, including the fluorophore. The result is that the intensity of the excitation light is not constant throughout the solution. Resultingly, only a small percentage of the excitation light reaches the fluorophores that are visible for the detection system. The inner filter effects change the spectrum and intensity of the emitted light and they must therefore be considered when analysing the emission spectrum of fluorescent light.Lakowicz, J. R. (1999). Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers ==Tryptophan fluorescence== The fluorescence of a folded protein is a mixture of the fluorescence from individual aromatic residues. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues, with some emissions due to tyrosine and phenylalanine; but disulfide bonds also have appreciable absorption in this wavelength range. Typically, tryptophan has a wavelength of maximum absorption of 280 nm and an emission peak that is solvatochromic, ranging from ca. 300 to 350 nm depending in the polarity of the local environment Intrinsic Fluorescence of Proteins and Peptides Hence, protein fluorescence may be used as a diagnostic of the conformational state of a protein. Furthermore, tryptophan fluorescence is strongly influenced by the proximity of other residues (i.e., nearby protonated groups such as Asp or Glu can cause quenching of Trp fluorescence). Also, energy transfer between tryptophan and the other fluorescent amino acids is possible, which would affect the analysis, especially in cases where the Förster acidic approach is taken. In addition, tryptophan is a relatively rare amino acid; many proteins contain only one or a few tryptophan residues. Therefore, tryptophan fluorescence can be a very sensitive measurement of the conformational state of individual tryptophan residues. The advantage compared to extrinsic probes is that the protein itself is not changed. The use of intrinsic fluorescence for the study of protein conformation is in practice limited to cases with few (or perhaps only one) tryptophan residues, since each experiences a different local environment, which gives rise to different emission spectra. Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of microenvironment of the tryptophan. When performing experiments with denaturants, surfactants or other amphiphilic molecules, the microenvironment of the tryptophan might change. For example, if a protein containing a single tryptophan in its 'hydrophobic' core is denatured with increasing temperature, a red-shifted emission spectrum will appear. This is due to the exposure of the tryptophan to an aqueous environment as opposed to a hydrophobic protein interior. In contrast, the addition of a surfactant to a protein which contains a tryptophan which is exposed to the aqueous solvent will cause a blue-shifted emission spectrum if the tryptophan is embedded in the surfactant vesicle or micelle.Caputo GA, London E. Cumulative effects of amino acid substitutions and hydrophobic mismatch upon the transmembrane stability and conformation of hydrophobic alpha-helices. Biochemistry. 2003 Mar 25;42(11):3275-85. Proteins that lack tryptophan may be coupled to a fluorophore. With fluorescence excitation at 295 nm, the tryptophan emission spectrum is dominant over the weaker tyrosine and phenylalanine fluorescence. ==Applications== Fluorescence spectroscopy is used in, among others, biochemical, medical, and chemical research fields for analyzing organic compounds. There has also been a report of its use in differentiating malignant skin tumors from benign. Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) techniques are useful in other kinds of analysis/measurement of a compound present in air or water, or other media, such as CVAFS which is used for heavy metals detection, such as mercury. Fluorescence can also be used to redirect photons, see fluorescent solar collector. Additionally, Fluorescence spectroscopy can be adapted to the microscopic level using microfluorimetry In analytical chemistry, fluorescence detectors are used with HPLC. In the field of water research, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to monitor water quality by detecting organic pollutants. Recent advances in computer science and machine learning have even enabled detection of bacterial contaminaton of water ==See also== * Lanthanide probes * Photoluminescence * Laser-induced fluorescence ==References== == External links == * Fluorophores.org, the database of fluorescent dyes * OpenFluor, Community tools supporting chemometric analysis of organic matter fluorescence * Database of fluorescent minerals with pictures, activators and spectra (fluomin.org) Category:Fluorescence ","title":"Fluorescence spectroscopy"},{"id":"516388","text":"The 1923 Quebec general election was held on February 5, 1923 to elect members of the 16th Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada.

Usually referred to as \\"Junior\\" or \\"Uncle June\\", he is the official boss of the DiMeo crime family for most of the series. A younger Corrado sometimes appears in flashbacks and is played by Rocco Sisto. Junior is smart, old-fashioned, stubborn and insecure about his power. Although Junior is portrayed as bitter and deceitful in season one, he shows a more considerate and humorous side of him in the later seasons and reveals a more sensitive side during his illness and house arrest. According to series creator David Chase the name Junior was taken from one of his own older cousins. Chianese had landed the role of Junior over Tony Sirico who plays Paulie Gualtieri, and Frank Vincent who plays Phil Leotardo. ==Background== In season one it is stated that Junior is 70 years old, placing his birth date in 1928 or 1929. Corrado Soprano, Jr. is the son of Corrado and Mariangela D'Agostino Soprano, who were from Ariano in the Province of Avellino and immigrated to the United States in 1911. Junior is Tony Soprano's uncle: Junior's younger brother is Tony's father Johnny Soprano. He tells the court-ordered psychologist when feigning mental incompetence that he was getting a haircut when he heard about the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. He tells Tony that he admired John F. Kennedy but did not like his brother Robert F. Kennedy because of Kennedy's United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management and prosecution of Jimmy Hoffa and investigation into the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Tony fondly recalls how as a child Junior taught him how to play baseball and took him to New York Yankees games. Both Junior and Johnny dropped out of high school and turned to a life of organized crime, joining the DiMeo crime family. It was revealed in season 2 episode 2 that Junior was a WWII veteran. Junior Soprano reveals \\"In Camelot\\" that he was on a date with Fran Felstein at the 500 Club in Atlantic City, New Jersey to see Enzo Stuarti perform when Fran met his brother Johnny. Junior was in love with Fran and wanted to propose, even buying a ring for her, but could not allow this marriage to affect his status in organized crime, and so could not bring up the courage to ask her. Junior always watched after Tony especially after Johnny's death from emphysema in 1986. He tells Bobby Baccalieri that he has a problem with feet and does not even like talking about bunions. Junior guided Tony's accession to the crime family when Tony took over his father's crew becoming the family's youngest captain. Following the arrest of longtime boss Ercole \\"Eckley\\" DiMeo in late 1995, Junior got into a trucking dispute with new acting boss Jackie Aprile Sr. He fled to Boca Raton to avoid any possible repercussions but Tony and Soprano soldier \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero arranged a sit down to solve the problem. Junior sometimes resented having to answer to the young Aprile, who used to fetch Junior sambucas. Junior never married, and has no children. He lives in Belleville, New Jersey. ==Plot details== In the opening episode, Junior plans to kill \\"Little Pussy\\" Malanga at a restaurant owned by Tony's childhood friend, Artie Bucco. Tony makes many attempts to prevent the murder and eventually resorts to fire bombing the restaurant to force its closure so the hit would happen elsewhere, enraging Junior. Tensions escalate further when two of Tony's criminal associates Christopher Moltisanti and Brendan Filone hijack a truck owned by a Harrison, New Jersey company that pays protection to Junior. Junior constantly expresses outrage and threats over the issue despite Tony's attempts to resolve it. When Brendan hijacks another truck and the driver is accidentally killed, Junior orders Brendan's murder. He spares Christopher's life because he is a surrogate nephew of Tony's, ordering a mock execution instead. Junior has been waiting a long time to become boss and with his senior rank, feels he is next in line. Upon Jackie's death Tony has the support to take over the family, but fears Junior will start a war if he is not named boss. Tony resolves the situation by letting Junior become boss in order to steer law enforcement attention away from the rest of the family. With the support of the other captains, Tony runs things behind the scenes, especially as Junior becomes greedier and more abusive of his authority. When Junior finds out about this from Tony's own mother he orders Tony's failed assassination. Tony retaliates by having two of Junior's enforcers, Mikey Palmice and Chucky Signore, murdered. Junior is spared only because the FBI arrests him on racketeering charges. Junior's acting captain, Philly \\"Spoons\\" Parisi, keeps commenting on the conflict between Tony and his uncle and also Livia's involvement, so Tony has him killed. With Junior and his main supporters either in jail or dead, Tony takes full control of the family. He lets Junior keep the title of boss while Tony runs everything as the street boss. Junior is allowed to run his old crew, but must give 95% of the proceeds to Tony. Along with a bigger share from his old high-end poker game, union rackets, and stolen car theft ring, this enables Junior to live on a subsistence level, while also making enough to pay his legal fees. Around this time, Junior's longtime goomah, Bobbi Sanfillipo, inadvertently causes word of Junior's talent for oral sex to spread among the mob wives, eventually reaching Tony, who mocks him in front of several other men. Junior furiously breaks up with Bobbi over this, smashing a lemon meringue pie in her face. Finally, Tony moves two soldiers from Junior's crew, Patsy Parisi (Philly's twin brother), and Gigi Cestone, over to his own crew. This leaves Junior the senile Murf Lupo as capo, Beppy Scerbo, and the dimwitted, obese Bobby Baccalieri as soldiers. Soon, Junior is released from jail and placed under house arrest in his Belleville, New Jersey home while awaiting trial, after his attorney convinces the judge that Junior is much sicker than he actually is. While he is under house arrest, Soprano captain Richie Aprile is released from prison after serving ten years, and actively seeks Junior's friendship. Richie wants him and Junior to kill Tony and take over the crime family. While Junior wants to take back control, he is also cautious of Richie's plans. Junior is conflicted over which side to favor, but eventually decides that while Tony can be selfish and impulsive, Richie simply is not respected enough by the rest of the family. Junior finally tells Tony of Richie's plans against him. Grateful for the warning, Tony increases Junior's take of his former rackets from 5% to 7.5%, and the two (more or less) bury the hatchet. During this time, Bobby Baccalieri becomes Junior's replacement, right-hand man and closest confidant. Bobby accompanies Junior on hospital visits during his battles with stomach cancer, which he eventually overcomes. Junior finds various ways to get around his house arrest—using his doctor's office and lawyer's office to conduct business and attending as many funerals and family functions as possible. Despite their disputes, Tony often seeks Junior's advice as the voice of experience. In Season four, Junior's trial ends in mistrial after they are able to intimidate one of the jurors into voting not guilty and forcing a hung jury. Although Junior has survived cancer and possible prison time, the toll of a series of 'mini-strokes' and the confinement of house arrest has since left him confused, depressed, and in failing health. By season five, Junior starts to show signs of dementia and becomes more dependent for care and support. In \\"Where's Johnny?\\", Junior goes wandering the streets in his bathrobe and slippers looking for his deceased brother. In season six of The Sopranos, Junior's dementia has worsened over the two year interval, as he becomes paranoid that his long-deceased enemy, \\"Little Pussy\\" Malanga, is after him. Tony, however, refuses to put his uncle in a nursing home, feeling obligated to care for Junior himself with the aid of his sisters and Bobby. In the season six debut episode, Tony arrives at Junior's house one evening and Junior, believing his nephew to be Malanga, shoots Tony in the abdomen. Frightened and in a state of panic, Junior runs upstairs, hiding away in his bedroom closet while Tony struggles to dial 9-1-1 before losing consciousness. Junior is arrested and taken into Federal custody over the shooting, but his lawyer secures him a release into a cushy mental institution, claiming he is currently unfit to stand trial. Junior remains confused and distressed by proceedings and denies that he could have deliberately shot his own nephew. Junior's dementia has progressed to such an extreme state that when his great-nephew A.J. Soprano visits him with the intention of killing him as revenge, Junior thinks A.J. is Tony and greets him with excitement. A.J.'s plan is botched when he inadvertently drops the knife on the floor. Tony pulls some strings with former Assemblyman, now State Senator, Ronald Zellman to get A.J. released without charges being filed. In the Wyckoff therapeutic center, Junior begins to put portions of his old life back together. He still collects weekly payments from his organizations and is occasionally visited by Pat Blundetto and Beppy Scerbo. Within the confines of the mental home, Junior behaves like a typical Mafia chieftain; bribing orderlies, organizing card games and even physically abusing a rival. A young patient named Carter Chong looks up to Junior as a mentor and father figure, and admires his aggressive, imposing, and rebellious nature. However, after Junior loses control of his bladder, the center's administrators conclude that he is not taking his medications. Junior is confronted with the choice of either taking the medication or being moved to a less pleasant facility. Junior agrees to take the medication and starts losing his aggressiveness and starts becoming more docile. He is badly beaten by his anger-prone protégé, who doesn't want to lose Junior as a mentor. In the final scene of \\"Remember When\\" Junior sits passively, black and blue, with broken glasses from his beating, silently sitting and petting a cat sitting on his lap. In the episode \\"The Blue Comet\\", Janice approaches Tony and tells him that Junior has run out of money, and will be removed from the Wyckoff therapeutic center and implores Tony help him out. Tony shows no sympathy for Junior and offers no support, even spitefully telling Janice that she and Bobby are cut out of his life too (although it is just an empty threat). In the final episode, \\"Made in America\\", Junior is moved to a state facility. When Janice goes to visit him, Junior thinks she is her mother Livia, and thinks that a picture of Janice's daughter is Janice herself. She tries to tell him that Bobby has been murdered, but Junior does not comprehend (thinking she means Bobby Kennedy). Tony later visits a now sick and feeble Junior for the first time since the shooting. Junior now uses a wheelchair. Junior recognizes him as someone he used to play catch with, remembering playing with Tony 40 years earlier. Tony tries to remind Junior of who he was, and even who his brother was, but Junior cannot remember. Tony tells him that he and his father used to run North Jersey, to which Junior simply smiles and replies, \\"Well that's nice\\". Tony finally realizes Junior is in an advanced stage of dementia and is saddened and frustrated that Junior is lost for good. Tony simply looks at Junior then tearfully leaves his uncle for the last time without saying another word. == References == ==External links== * HBO Profile: Corrado \\"Junior\\" Soprano Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional characters with cancer Category:Fictional crime bosses Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional World War II veterans Category:Fictional characters with dementia Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 ","title":"Junior Soprano"},{"id":"516393","text":"In information theory, a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is a linear error correcting code, a method of transmitting a message over a noisy transmission channel.David J.C. MacKay (2003) Information theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms, CUP, , (also available online)Todd K. Moon (2005) Error Correction Coding, Mathematical Methods and Algorithms. Wiley, (Includes code) An LDPC is constructed using a sparse Tanner graph (subclass of the bipartite graph).Amin Shokrollahi (2003) LDPC Codes: An Introduction LDPC codes are capacity-approaching codes, which means that practical constructions exist that allow the noise threshold to be set very close to the theoretical maximum (the Shannon limit) for a symmetric memoryless channel. The noise threshold defines an upper bound for the channel noise, up to which the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired. Using iterative belief propagation techniques, LDPC codes can be decoded in time linear to their block length. LDPC codes are finding increasing use in applications requiring reliable and highly efficient information transfer over bandwidth-constrained or return-channel-constrained links in the presence of corrupting noise. Implementation of LDPC codes has lagged behind that of other codes, notably turbo codes. The fundamental patent for turbo codes expired on August 29, 2013.NewScientist, Communication speed nears terminal velocity, by Dana Mackenzie, 9 July 2005 LDPC codes are also known as Gallager codes, in honor of Robert G. Gallager, who developed the LDPC concept in his doctoral dissertation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960. ==History== Impractical to implement when first developed by Gallager in 1963, LDPC codes were forgotten until his work was rediscovered in 1996.David J.C. MacKay and Radford M. Neal, \\"Near Shannon Limit Performance of Low Density Parity Check Codes,\\" Electronics Letters, July 1996 Turbo codes, another class of capacity- approaching codes discovered in 1993, became the coding scheme of choice in the late 1990s, used for applications such as the Deep Space Network and satellite communications. However, the advances in low-density parity-check codes have seen them surpass turbo codes in terms of error floor and performance in the higher code rate range, leaving turbo codes better suited for the lower code rates only.Telemetry Data Decoding, Design Handbook ==Applications== In 2003, an irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) style LDPC code beat six turbo codes to become the error-correcting code in the new DVB-S2 standard for the satellite transmission of digital television.Presentation by Hughes Systems The DVB-S2 selection committee made decoder complexity estimates for the Turbo Code proposals using a much less efficient serial decoder architecture rather than a parallel decoder architecture. This forced the Turbo Code proposals to use frame sizes on the order of one half the frame size of the LDPC proposals. In 2008, LDPC beat convolutional turbo codes as the forward error correction (FEC) system for the ITU-T G.hn standard.HomePNA Blog: G.hn, a PHY For All Seasons G.hn chose LDPC codes over turbo codes because of their lower decoding complexity (especially when operating at data rates close to 1.0 Gbit/s) and because the proposed turbo codes exhibited a significant error floor at the desired range of operation.IEEE Communications Magazine paper on G.hn LDPC codes are also used for 10GBASE-T Ethernet, which sends data at 10 gigabits per second over twisted-pair cables. As of 2009, LDPC codes are also part of the Wi-Fi 802.11 standard as an optional part of 802.11n and 802.11ac, in the High Throughput (HT) PHY specification.IEEE Standard, section 20.3.11.6 \\"802.11n-2009\\", IEEE, October 29, 2009, accessed March 21, 2011. Some OFDM systems add an additional outer error correction that fixes the occasional errors (the \\"error floor\\") that get past the LDPC correction inner code even at low bit error rates. For example: The Reed- Solomon code with LDPC Coded Modulation (RS-LCM) uses a Reed-Solomon outer code. Chih-Yuan Yang, Mong-Kai Ku. http://123seminarsonly.com/Seminar- Reports/029/26540350-Ldpc-Coded-Ofdm-Modulation.pdf \\"LDPC coded OFDM modulation for high spectral efficiency transmission\\" The DVB-S2, the DVB-T2 and the DVB-C2 standards all use a BCH code outer code to mop up residual errors after LDPC decoding. Nick Wells. \\"DVB-T2 in relation to the DVB-x2 Family of Standards\\" ==Operational use== LDPC codes functionally are defined by a sparse parity-check matrix. This sparse matrix is often randomly generated, subject to the sparsity constraints—LDPC code construction is discussed later. These codes were first designed by Robert Gallager in 1962. Below is a graph fragment of an example LDPC code using Forney's factor graph notation. In this graph, n variable nodes in the top of the graph are connected to (n−k) constraint nodes in the bottom of the graph. This is a popular way of graphically representing an (n, k) LDPC code. The bits of a valid message, when placed on the T's at the top of the graph, satisfy the graphical constraints. Specifically, all lines connecting to a variable node (box with an '=' sign) have the same value, and all values connecting to a factor node (box with a '+' sign) must sum, modulo two, to zero (in other words, they must sum to an even number; or there must be an even number of odd values). none Ignoring any lines going out of the picture, there are eight possible six-bit strings corresponding to valid codewords: (i.e., 000000, 011001, 110010, 101011, 111100, 100101, 001110, 010111). This LDPC code fragment represents a three-bit message encoded as six bits. Redundancy is used, here, to increase the chance of recovering from channel errors. This is a (6, 3) linear code, with n = 6 and k = 3\\\\. Again ignoring lines going out of the picture, the parity-check matrix representing this graph fragment is : \\\\mathbf{H} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. In this matrix, each row represents one of the three parity-check constraints, while each column represents one of the six bits in the received codeword. In this example, the eight codewords can be obtained by putting the parity-check matrix H into this form \\\\begin{bmatrix} -P^T  I_{n-k} \\\\end{bmatrix} through basic row operations in GF(2): :\\\\mathbf{H} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}_1 \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}_2 \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}_3 \\\\sim \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}_4. Step 1: H. Step 2: Row 1 is added to row 3. Step 3: Row 2 and 3 are swapped. Step 4: Row 1 is added to row 3. From this, the generator matrix G can be obtained as \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_{k}  P \\\\end{bmatrix} (noting that in the special case of this being a binary code P = -P), or specifically: :\\\\mathbf{G} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. Finally, by multiplying all eight possible 3-bit strings by G, all eight valid codewords are obtained. For example, the codeword for the bit-string '101' is obtained by: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. As a check, the row space of G is orthogonal to H such that G H^T = 0 The bit- string '101' is found in as the first 3 bits of the codeword '101011'. == Example Encoder == Figure 1 illustrates the functional components of most LDPC encoders. Fig. 1. LDPC Encoder During the encoding of a frame, the input data bits (D) are repeated and distributed to a set of constituent encoders. The constituent encoders are typically accumulators and each accumulator is used to generate a parity symbol. A single copy of the original data (S0,K-1) is transmitted with the parity bits (P) to make up the code symbols. The S bits from each constituent encoder are discarded. The parity bit may be used within another constituent code. In an example using the DVB-S2 rate 2/3 code the encoded block size is 64800 symbols (N=64800) with 43200 data bits (K=43200) and 21600 parity bits (M=21600). Each constituent code (check node) encodes 16 data bits except for the first parity bit which encodes 8 data bits. The first 4680 data bits are repeated 13 times (used in 13 parity codes), while the remaining data bits are used in 3 parity codes (irregular LDPC code). For comparison, classic turbo codes typically use two constituent codes configured in parallel, each of which encodes the entire input block (K) of data bits. These constituent encoders are recursive convolutional codes (RSC) of moderate depth (8 or 16 states) that are separated by a code interleaver which interleaves one copy of the frame. The LDPC code, in contrast, uses many low depth constituent codes (accumulators) in parallel, each of which encode only a small portion of the input frame. The many constituent codes can be viewed as many low depth (2 state) 'convolutional codes' that are connected via the repeat and distribute operations. The repeat and distribute operations perform the function of the interleaver in the turbo code. The ability to more precisely manage the connections of the various constituent codes and the level of redundancy for each input bit give more flexibility in the design of LDPC codes, which can lead to better performance than turbo codes in some instances. Turbo codes still seem to perform better than LDPCs at low code rates, or at least the design of well performing low rate codes is easier for Turbo Codes. As a practical matter, the hardware that forms the accumulators is reused during the encoding process. That is, once a first set of parity bits are generated and the parity bits stored, the same accumulator hardware is used to generate a next set of parity bits. ==Decoding== As with other codes, the maximum likelihood decoding of an LDPC code on the binary symmetric channel is an NP-complete problem. Performing optimal decoding for a NP- complete code of any useful size is not practical. However, sub-optimal techniques based on iterative belief propagation decoding give excellent results and can be practically implemented. The sub-optimal decoding techniques view each parity check that makes up the LDPC as an independent single parity check (SPC) code. Each SPC code is decoded separately using soft-in-soft-out (SISO) techniques such as SOVA, BCJR, MAP, and other derivates thereof. The soft decision information from each SISO decoding is cross-checked and updated with other redundant SPC decodings of the same information bit. Each SPC code is then decoded again using the updated soft decision information. This process is iterated until a valid code word is achieved or decoding is exhausted. This type of decoding is often referred to as sum-product decoding. The decoding of the SPC codes is often referred to as the \\"check node\\" processing, and the cross-checking of the variables is often referred to as the \\"variable-node\\" processing. In a practical LDPC decoder implementation, sets of SPC codes are decoded in parallel to increase throughput. In contrast, belief propagation on the binary erasure channel is particularly simple where it consists of iterative constraint satisfaction. For example, consider that the valid codeword, 101011, from the example above, is transmitted across a binary erasure channel and received with the first and fourth bit erased to yield ?01?11. Since the transmitted message must have satisfied the code constraints, the message can be represented by writing the received message on the top of the factor graph. In this example, the first bit cannot yet be recovered, because all of the constraints connected to it have more than one unknown bit. In order to proceed with decoding the message, constraints connecting to only one of the erased bits must be identified. In this example, only the second constraint suffices. Examining the second constraint, the fourth bit must have been zero, since only a zero in that position would satisfy the constraint. This procedure is then iterated. The new value for the fourth bit can now be used in conjunction with the first constraint to recover the first bit as seen below. This means that the first bit must be a one to satisfy the leftmost constraint. none Thus, the message can be decoded iteratively. For other channel models, the messages passed between the variable nodes and check nodes are real numbers, which express probabilities and likelihoods of belief. This result can be validated by multiplying the corrected codeword r by the parity-check matrix H: :\\\\mathbf{z} = \\\\mathbf{Hr} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. Because the outcome z (the syndrome) of this operation is the three × one zero vector, the resulting codeword r is successfully validated. After the decoding is completed, the original message bits '101' can be extracted by looking at the first 3 bits of the codeword. While illustrative, this erasure example does not show the use of soft-decision decoding or soft- decision message passing, which is used in virtually all commercial LDPC decoders. === Updating node information === In recent years, there has also been a great deal of work spent studying the effects of alternative schedules for variable-node and constraint-node update. The original technique that was used for decoding LDPC codes was known as flooding. This type of update required that, before updating a variable node, all constraint nodes needed to be updated and vice versa. In later work by Vila Casado et al.,A.I. Vila Casado, M. Griot, and R.Wesel, \\"Informed dynamic scheduling for belief propagation decoding of LDPC codes,\\" Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. on Comm. (ICC), June 2007. alternative update techniques were studied, in which variable nodes are updated with the newest available check-node information. The intuition behind these algorithms is that variable nodes whose values vary the most are the ones that need to be updated first. Highly reliable nodes, whose log- likelihood ratio (LLR) magnitude is large and does not change significantly from one update to the next, do not require updates with the same frequency as other nodes, whose sign and magnitude fluctuate more widely. These scheduling algorithms show greater speed of convergence and lower error floors than those that use flooding. These lower error floors are achieved by the ability of the Informed Dynamic Scheduling (IDS) algorithm to overcome trapping sets of near codewords.T. Richardson, \\"Error floors of LDPC codes,\\" in Proc. 41st Allerton Conf. Comm., Control, and Comput., Monticello, IL, 2003. When nonflooding scheduling algorithms are used, an alternative definition of iteration is used. For an (n, k) LDPC code of rate k/n, a full iteration occurs when n variable and n − k constraint nodes have been updated, no matter the order in which they were updated. === Lookup table decoding === It is possible to decode LDPC codes on a relatively low-power microprocessor by the use of lookup tables. While codes such as the LDPC are generally implemented on high- power processors, with long block lengths, there are also applications which use lower-power processors and short block lengths (1024). Therefore, it is possible to precalculate the output bit based upon predetermined input bits. A table is generated which contains n entries (for a block length of 1024 bits, this would be 1024 bits long), and contains all possible entries for different input states (both errored and nonerrored). As a bit is input, it is then added to a FIFO register, and the value of the FIFO register is then used to look up in the table the relevant output from the precalculated values. By this method, very high iterations can be used, with little processor overhead, the only cost being that of the memory for the lookup table, such that LDPC decoding is possible even on a 4.0 MHz PIC chip. == Code construction == For large block sizes, LDPC codes are commonly constructed by first studying the behaviour of decoders. As the block size tends to infinity, LDPC decoders can be shown to have a noise threshold below which decoding is reliably achieved, and above which decoding is not achieved,Thomas J. Richardson and M. Amin Shokrollahi and Rüdiger L. Urbanke, \\"Design of Capacity-Approaching Irregular Low-Density Parity-Check Codes,\\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 47(2), February 2001 colloquially referred to as the cliff effect. This threshold can be optimised by finding the best proportion of arcs from check nodes and arcs from variable nodes. An approximate graphical approach to visualising this threshold is an EXIT chart. The construction of a specific LDPC code after this optimization falls into two main types of techniques: *Pseudorandom approaches *Combinatorial approaches Construction by a pseudo- random approach builds on theoretical results that, for large block size, a random construction gives good decoding performance. In general, pseudorandom codes have complex encoders, but pseudorandom codes with the best decoders can have simple encoders.Thomas J. Richardson and Rüdiger L. Urbanke, \\"Efficient Encoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes,\\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 47(2), February 2001 Various constraints are often applied to help ensure that the desired properties expected at the theoretical limit of infinite block size occur at a finite block size. Combinatorial approaches can be used to optimize the properties of small block-size LDPC codes or to create codes with simple encoders. Some LDPC codes are based on Reed–Solomon codes, such as the RS-LDPC code used in the 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard. Ahmad Darabiha, Anthony Chan Carusone, Frank R. Kschischang. \\"Power Reduction Techniques for LDPC Decoders\\" Compared to randomly generated LDPC codes, structured LDPC codes—such as the LDPC code used in the DVB-S2 standard—can have simpler and therefore lower-cost hardware—in particular, codes constructed such that the H matrix is a circulant matrix. Zhengya Zhang, Venkat Anantharam, Martin J. Wainwright, and Borivoje Nikolic. \\"An Efficient 10GBASE-T Ethernet LDPC Decoder Design With Low Error Floors\\". Yet another way of constructing LDPC codes is to use finite geometries. This method was proposed by Y. Kou et al. in 2001.Y. Kou, S. Lin and M. Fossorier, \\"Low- Density Parity-Check Codes Based on Finite Geometries: A Rediscovery and New Results,\\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 47, no. 7, November 2001, pp. 2711- 2736. == LDPC codes vs. Turbo codes == LDPC codes can be compared with other powerful coding schemes, e.g. Turbo codes.Tahir, B., Schwarz, S., & Rupp, M. (2017, May). BER comparison between Convolutional, Turbo, LDPC, and Polar codes. In 2017 24th International Conference on Telecommunications (ICT) (pp. 1-7). IEEE. In one hand, BER performance of Turbo codes is influenced by low codes limitations.Moon Todd, K. Error correction coding: mathematical methods and algorithms. 2005 by John Wiley & Sons. . - p.614 LDPC codes have no limitations of minimum distance,Moon Todd, K. Error correction coding: mathematical methods and algorithms. 2005 by John Wiley & Sons. . - p.653 that indirectly means that LDPC codes may be more efficient on relatively large code rates (e.g. 3/4, 5/6, 7/8) than Turbo codes. However, LDPC codes are not the complete replacement: Turbo codes are the best solution at the lower code rates (e.g. 1/6, 1/3, 1/2).Andrews, Kenneth S., et al. \\"The development of turbo and LDPC codes for deep-space applications.\\" Proceedings of the IEEE 95.11 (2007): 2142-2156.Hassan, A.E.S., Dessouky, M., Abou Elazm, A. and Shokair, M., 2012.

Monochromator in an x-ray beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. A monochromator is an optical device that transmits a mechanically selectable narrow band of wavelengths of light or other radiation chosen from a wider range of wavelengths available at the input. The name is from the Greek roots mono-, \\"single\\", and chroma, \\"colour\\", and the Latin suffix -ator, denoting an agent. == Uses == ECHIDNA powder diffractometer at OPAL in Australia. It is made by slabs of [113] oriented Germanium crystals which are inclined towards each other in order to focus down the Bragg reflected beam. A device that can produce monochromatic light has many uses in science and in optics because many optical characteristics of a material are dependent on wavelength. Although there are a number of useful ways to select a narrow band of wavelengths (which, in the visible range, is perceived as a pure color), there are not as many other ways to easily select any wavelength band from a wide range. See below for a discussion of some of the uses of monochromators. In hard X-ray and neutron optics, crystal monochromators are used to define wave conditions on the instruments. ==Techniques== A monochromator can use either the phenomenon of optical dispersion in a prism, or that of diffraction using a diffraction grating, to spatially separate the colors of light. It usually has a mechanism for directing the selected color to an exit slit. Usually the grating or the prism is used in a reflective mode. A reflective prism is made by making a right triangle prism (typically, half of an equilateral prism) with one side mirrored. The light enters through the hypotenuse face and is reflected back through it, being refracted twice at the same surface. The total refraction, and the total dispersion, is the same as would occur if an equilateral prism were used in transmission mode. ===Collimation=== The dispersion or diffraction is only controllable if the light is collimated, that is if all the rays of light are parallel, or practically so. A source, like the sun, which is very far away, provides collimated light. Newton used sunlight in his famous experiments. In a practical monochromator, however, the light source is close by, and an optical system in the monochromator converts the diverging light of the source to collimated light. Although some monochromator designs do use focusing gratings that do not need separate collimators, most use collimating mirrors. Reflective optics are preferred because they do not introduce dispersive effects of their own. ===Czerny–Turner monochromator=== Diagram of a Czerny–Turner monochromator A combined reflecting-focusing diffraction grating A Fastie–Ebert monochromator. This is similar to the Czerny–Turner but uses a common collimator/refocusing mirror. In the common Czerny–Turner design, the broad-band illumination source (A) is aimed at an entrance slit (B). The amount of light energy available for use depends on the intensity of the source in the space defined by the slit (width × height) and the acceptance angle of the optical system. The slit is placed at the effective focus of a curved mirror (the collimator, C) so that the light from the slit reflected from the mirror is collimated (focused at infinity). The collimated light is diffracted from the grating (D) and then is collected by another mirror (E), which refocuses the light, now dispersed, on the exit slit (F). In a prism monochromator, a reflective Littrow prism takes the place of the diffraction grating, in which case the light is refracted by the prism. At the exit slit, the colors of the light are spread out (in the visible this shows the colors of the rainbow). Because each color arrives at a separate point in the exit-slit plane, there are a series of images of the entrance slit focused on the plane. Because the entrance slit is finite in width, parts of nearby images overlap. The light leaving the exit slit (G) contains the entire image of the entrance slit of the selected color plus parts of the entrance slit images of nearby colors. A rotation of the dispersing element causes the band of colors to move relative to the exit slit, so that the desired entrance slit image is centered on the exit slit. The range of colors leaving the exit slit is a function of the width of the slits. The entrance and exit slit widths are adjusted together. ===Stray light=== The ideal transfer function of such a monochromator is a triangular shape. The peak of the triangle is at the nominal wavelength selected. The intensity of the nearby colors then decreases linearly on either side of this peak until some cutoff value is reached, where the intensity stops decreasing. This is called the stray light level. The cutoff level is typically about one thousandth of the peak value, or 0.1%. ===Spectral bandwidth=== Spectral bandwidth is defined as the width of the triangle at the points where the light has reached half the maximum value (full width at half maximum, abbreviated as FWHM). A typical spectral bandwidth might be one nanometer; however, different values can be chosen to meet the need of analysis. A narrower bandwidth does improve the resolution, but it also decreases the signal-to-noise ratio.Keppy, N. K. and Allen M., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI, USA, 2008 ===Dispersion=== The dispersion of a monochromator is characterized as the width of the band of colors per unit of slit width, 1 nm of spectrum per mm of slit width for instance. This factor is constant for a grating, but varies with wavelength for a prism. If a scanning prism monochromator is used in a constant bandwidth mode, the slit width must change as the wavelength changes. Dispersion depends on the focal length, the grating order and grating resolving power. ===Wavelength range=== A monochromator's adjustment range might cover the visible spectrum and some part of both or either of the nearby ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectra, although monochromators are built for a great variety of optical ranges, and to a great many designs. ===Double monochromators=== It is common for two monochromators to be connected in series, with their mechanical systems operating in tandem so that they both select the same color. This arrangement is not intended to improve the narrowness of the spectrum, but rather to lower the cutoff level. A double monochromator may have a cutoff about one millionth of the peak value, the product of the two cutoffs of the individual sections. The intensity of the light of other colors in the exit beam is referred to as the stray light level and is the most critical specification of a monochromator for many uses. Achieving low stray light is a large part of the art of making a practical monochromator. ===Diffraction gratings and blazed gratings=== Grating monochromators disperse ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiation typically using replica gratings, which are manufactured from a master grating. A master grating consists of a hard, optically flat, surface that has a large number of parallel and closely spaced grooves. The construction of a master grating is a long, expensive process because the grooves must be of identical size, exactly parallel, and equally spaced over the length of the grating (3–10 cm). A grating for the ultraviolet and visible region typically has 300–2000 grooves/mm, however 1200–1400 grooves/mm is most common. For the infrared region, gratings usually have 10–200 grooves/mm. When a diffraction grating is used, care must be taken in the design of broadband monochromators because the diffraction pattern has overlapping orders. Sometimes broadband preselector filters are inserted in the optical path to limit the width of the diffraction orders so they do not overlap. Sometimes this is done by using a prism as one of the monochromators of a dual monochromator design. The original high- resolution diffraction gratings were ruled. The construction of high-quality ruling engines was a large undertaking (as well as exceedingly difficult, in past decades), and good gratings were very expensive. The slope of the triangular groove in a ruled grating is typically adjusted to enhance the brightness of a particular diffraction order. This is called blazing a grating. Ruled gratings have imperfections that produce faint \\"ghost\\" diffraction orders that may raise the stray light level of a monochromator. A later photolithographic technique allows gratings to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic gratings have sinusoidal grooves and so are not as bright, but have lower scattered light levels than blazed gratings. Almost all the gratings actually used in monochromators are carefully made replicas of ruled or holographic master gratings. ===Prisms=== The internal structure of a Reflecting monochromator using a single prism.The yellow line indicates the path of light. Prisms have higher dispersion in the UV region. Prism monochromators are favored in some instruments that are principally designed to work in the far UV region. Most monochromators use gratings, however. Some monochromators have several gratings that can be selected for use in different spectral regions. A double monochromator made by placing a prism and a grating monochromator in series typically does not need additional bandpass filters to isolate a single grating order. ===Focal length=== The narrowness of the band of colors that a monochromator can generate is related to the focal length of the monochromator collimators. Using a longer focal length optical system also unfortunately decreases the amount of light that can be accepted from the source. Very high resolution monochromators might have a focal length of 2 meters. Building such monochromators requires exceptional attention to mechanical and thermal stability. For many applications a monochromator of about 0.4 meter focal length is considered to have excellent resolution. Many monochromators have a focal length less than 0.1 meter. ===Slit height=== The most common optical system uses spherical collimators and thus contains optical aberrations that curve the field where the slit images come to focus, so that slits are sometimes curved instead of simply straight, to approximate the curvature of the image. This allows taller slits to be used, gathering more light, while still achieving high spectral resolution. Some designs take another approach and use toroidal collimating mirrors to correct the curvature instead, allowing higher straight slits without sacrificing resolution. ===Wavelength vs energy=== Monochromators are often calibrated in units of wavelength. Uniform rotation of a grating produces a sinusoidal change in wavelength, which is approximately linear for small grating angles, so such an instrument is easy to build. Many of the underlying physical phenomena being studied are linear in energy though, and since wavelength and energy have a reciprocal relationship, spectral patterns that are simple and predictable when plotted as a function of energy are distorted when plotted as a function of wavelength. Some monochromators are calibrated in units of reciprocal centimeters or some other energy units, but the scale may not be linear. ===Dynamic range=== A spectrophotometer built with a high quality double monochromator can produce light of sufficient purity and intensity that the instrument can measure a narrow band of optical attenuation of about one million fold (6 AU, Absorbance Units). ==Applications== Monochromators are used in many optical measuring instruments and in other applications where tunable monochromatic light is wanted. Sometimes the monochromatic light is directed at a sample and the reflected or transmitted light is measured. Sometimes white light is directed at a sample and the monochromator is used to analyze the reflected or transmitted light. Two monochromators are used in many fluorometers; one monochromator is used to select the excitation wavelength and a second monochromator is used to analyze the emitted light. An automatic scanning spectrometer includes a mechanism to change the wavelength selected by the monochromator and to record the resulting changes in the measured quantity as a function of the wavelength. If an imaging device replaces the exit slit, the result is the basic configuration of a spectrograph. This configuration allows the simultaneous analysis of the intensities of a wide band of colors. Photographic film or an array of photodetectors can be used, for instance to collect the light. Such an instrument can record a spectral function without mechanical scanning, although there may be tradeoffs in terms of resolution or sensitivity for instance. An absorption spectrophotometer measures the absorption of light by a sample as a function of wavelength. Sometimes the result is expressed as percent transmission and sometimes it is expressed as the inverse logarithm of the transmission. The Beer–Lambert law relates the absorption of light to the concentration of the light-absorbing material, the optical path length, and an intrinsic property of the material called molar absorptivity. According to this relation the decrease in intensity is exponential in concentration and path length. The decrease is linear in these quantities when the inverse logarithm of transmission is used. The old nomenclature for this value was optical density (OD), current nomenclature is absorbance units (AU). One AU is a tenfold reduction in light intensity. Six AU is a millionfold reduction. Absorption spectrophotometers often contain a monochromator to supply light to the sample. Some absorption spectrophotometers have automatic spectral analysis capabilities. Absorption spectrophotometers have many everyday uses in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. For example, they are used to measure the concentration or change in concentration of many substances that absorb light. Critical characteristics of many biological materials, many enzymes for instance, are measured by starting a chemical reaction that produces a color change that depends on the presence or activity of the material being studied.Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al. Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition. New York: W. H. Freeman; 2000. Section 3.5, Purifying, Detecting, and Characterizing Proteins. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21589/ Optical thermometers have been created by calibrating the change in absorbance of a material against temperature. There are many other examples. Spectrophotometers are used to measure the specular reflectance of mirrors and the diffuse reflectance of colored objects. They are used to characterize the performance of sunglasses, laser protective glasses, and other optical filters. There are many other examples. In the UV, visible and near IR, absorbance and reflectance spectrophotometers usually illuminate the sample with monochromatic light. In the corresponding IR instruments, the monochromator is usually used to analyze the light coming from the sample. Monochromators are also used in optical instruments that measure other phenomena besides simple absorption or reflection, wherever the color of the light is a significant variable. Circular dichroism spectrometers contain a monochromator, for example. Lasers produce light which is much more monochromatic than the optical monochromators discussed here, but only some lasers are easily tunable, and these lasers are not as simple to use. Monochromatic light allows for the measurement of the quantum efficiency (QE) of an imaging device (e.g. CCD or CMOS imager). Light from the exit slit is passed either through diffusers or an integrating sphere on to the imaging device while a calibrated detector simultaneously measures the light. Coordination of the imager, calibrated detector, and monochromator allows one to calculate the carriers (electrons or holes) generated for a photon of a given wavelength, QE. ==See also== * Atomic absorption spectrometers use light from hollow cathode lamps that emit light generated by atoms of a specific element, for instance iron or lead or calcium. The available colors are fixed, but are very monochromatic and are excellent for measuring the concentration of specific elements in a sample. These instruments behave as if they contained a very high quality monochromator, but their use is limited to analyzing the elements they are equipped for. * A major IR measurement technique, Fourier transform IR, or FTIR, does not use a monochromator. Instead, the measurement is performed in the time domain, using the field autocorrelation technique. *Polychromator *Ultrafast monochromator – a monochromator that compensates for path length delays that would stretch ultrashort pulses *Wien filter – a technique for producing \\"monochromatic\\" electron beams, where all the electrons have nearly the same energy ==References== == External links == * Discusses monochromator design in great detail * * Double folded-z-configuration monochromator. - contains an extended discussion of the design rationale of this UV-VIS-NIR monochromator Category:Optical devices Category:Spectroscopy ja:分光器#モノクロメーター ","title":"Monochromator"},{"id":"516417","text":"Tef or TEF may refer to: * Eragrostis tef, a cereal from Ethiopia * Teaching Excellence Framework, a UK government assessment of the quality of undergraduate teaching in universities * (stock symbol \`TEF\`) * Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919–1991), American singer * , a test of fluency in French * The Elias Fund, a nonprofit organization empowering development in Zimbabwean youth * The Endless Forest, an online game * Thermic effect of food, an increment of energy expenditure * TEF (gene), Thyrotrophic embryonic factor, a human gene * Total enclosure fetishism, a form of sexual fetishism * Toxic equivalency factor for dioxins and dioxin-like compound * Tracheoesophageal fistula, a medical condition * Transeuropa Ferries, a ferry operator * Textual Editing Framework, a textual modeling tool for the Eclipse Modeling Framework software engineering facility ","title":"Tef"},{"id":"516418","text":"Adriana La Cerva is a fictional character on the HBO TV series The Sopranos, portrayed by Drea de Matteo. She is the long-time girlfriend and, later, fiancée of Tony Soprano's protégé, Christopher Moltisanti. For her performance, De Matteo won the 2004 Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. ==Character history== Adriana is the niece of Jackie and Richie Aprile. Growing up she sees and hears plenty, and is not repulsed by the Mafia lifestyle. She starts out as a hostess at Artie Bucco's restaurant, Vesuvio. Adriana is initially portrayed as shallow and materialistic, interested in the things that her boyfriend Christopher's money could buy: expensive cars, shoes, jewelry, drugs, and designer clothing. Despite the couple growing closer, she becomes a frequent victim of domestic violence at the hands of Christopher. After he and Adriana fight, she moves in with her mother, but Chris gets her back by proposing to her, against her mother's advice. Despite this, the two do not get married. She reveals to Chris that she is potentially infertile, which leads to another bout of domestic violence. Despite the violence, she always seems to have Christopher's best interests (as well as her own) in mind. Adriana is portrayed as ambitious and wanting to have a business of her own. In Season 3, Christopher acquires The Lollipop Lounge in West Long Branch, Monmouth County, New Jersey, from a gambling debtor, and turns it over to Adriana to manage as she pleases. Adriana renames the bar \\"Crazy Horse\\" and makes it successful as a venue for local alternative rock bands and as a bar for college students from nearby Monmouth University and elsewhere. Benny Fazio is beaten in the night club's parking lot by Phil Leotardo. In Season 5, Adriana is diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. ===The mole=== The FBI targets Adriana as a potential weakness in the family's organization. Upon the death of Sal \\"Big Pussy\\" Bonpensiero, the FBI looks to Adriana as a close relation to a rising star in the crime family and sends Special Agent Deborah Ciccerone to befriend her. Ciccerone, who goes by \\"Danielle Ciccolella\\", succeeds at befriending Adriana, but the feds have to abandon the mission earlier than planned after Christopher makes a pass at Ciccerone. Nonetheless, the FBI learns of Christopher's heroin addiction, which they know would enrage Tony Soprano, and turns Adriana into an informant by threatening her with prison time for cocaine distribution at the nightclub she manages. Out of loyalty to Christopher, Adriana avoids giving up any serious information on the family and does her best to avoid the Soprano family house in order to have nothing to give back to the feds. Her deception catches up with her after the FBI learns of her involvement in covering up a murder at her club and threatens to press charges of being an accessory to murder against her unless she offers full cooperation, which would include wearing a wire. She reveals the truth to Christopher, hoping they can go into the Witness Protection Program together and start new lives. An enraged Christopher beats and almost strangles her, before breaking down crying. His loyalty to his crime family turns out to be greater than his love for Adriana, and he reveals her status as an informant to Tony. Tony telephones Adriana, falsely informing her that Christopher has attempted suicide at a diner in Ramapo Mountain State Forest and has been hospitalized, and that Silvio Dante will drive her to the hospital. En route on Interstate 287, Silvio stops the car in the middle of the woods. Realizing what is about to happen, a terrified Adriana tries to flee, but Silvio drags her from the car and shoots her dead. Christopher is later seen putting some of her clothes in a red suitcase and dumping them, and then leaves her light blue Ford Thunderbird in the long-term parking lot at the Liberty Airport in Newark, New Jersey. ===Post-mortem=== In the Season 6 episode \\"The Ride\\", Carmela Soprano runs into Adriana's mother, Liz La Cerva, who tells Carmela that she believes Christopher killed Adriana, and that the FBI questioned her about Adriana's disappearance. When Carmela tells Tony about their conversation, he dismisses her fears, explaining that if Christopher had killed Adriana then her body would have been found by now. Furthermore, he reminds Carmela that if the FBI really suspected Christopher, then they would have arrested him. While in Paris, Carmela dreams of seeing Adriana in a park, but a policeman tells her Adriana is dead. Carmela is intent on finding her, especially after Liz La Cerva tries to kill herself. However, Tony and Silvio pull some strings and Carmela is able to continue construction on her spec house, and the distraction keeps her from investigating the matter further. ==See also== * FBI on The Sopranos ==References== ==External links== * HBO Profile: Adriana La Cerva Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:Fictional heroin users Category:Fictional managers Category:Fictional smokers sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Adriana \\"Ade\\" La Cerva ","title":"Adriana La Cerva"},{"id":"516419","text":"The 1900 Quebec general election was held on December 7, 1900 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.

The name literally means 'seasonal division', but usually the term refers to the spring Setsubun, properly called celebrated yearly on February 3 as part of the . In its association with the Lunar New Year, spring Setsubun can be and was previously thought of as a sort of New Year's Eve, and so was accompanied by a special ritual to cleanse away all the evil of the former year and drive away disease-bringing evil spirits for the year to come. This special ritual is called . Setsubun has its origins in , a Chinese custom introduced to Japan in the eighth century. ==Mamemaki== The custom of mamemaki first appeared in the Muromachi period. It is usually performed by the toshiotoko () of the household (the male who was born on the corresponding animal year on the Chinese zodiac), or else the male head of the household. Roasted soybeans (called ) are thrown either out the door or at a member of the family wearing an Oni (demon or ogre) mask, while the people say and slam the door. This is still common practice in households but many people will attend a shrine or temple's spring festival where this is done. The beans are thought to symbolically purify the home by driving away the evil spirits that bring misfortune and bad health with them. Then, as part of bringing luck in, it is customary to eat roasted soybeans, one for each year of one's life, and in some areas, one for each year of one's life plus one more for bringing good luck for the year to come. The gestures of mamemaki look similar to the Western custom of throwing rice at newly married couples after a wedding. ==Other practices== Sardine head talisman on house entrance to keep bad spirits away At Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines all over the country, there are celebrations for Setsubun. Priests and invited guests will throw roasted soy beans (some wrapped in gold or silver foil), small envelopes with money, sweets, candies and other prizes. In some bigger shrines, even celebrities and sumo wrestlers will be invited; these events are televised nationally. At Sensō-ji in the Asakusa neighborhood of Tokyo, crowds of nearly 100,000 people attend the annual festivities. It is customary in Kansai area to eat uncut makizushi called , a type of futomaki (, \\"thick, large or fat rolls\\"), in silence on Setsubun while facing the year's lucky compass direction, determined by the zodiac symbol of that year. This custom started in Osaka, but in recent years eho-maki can be purchased at stores in the Kanto area and it is getting more recognized as a part of Setsubun tradition. Charts are published and occasionally packaged with uncut makizushi during February. Some families put up small decorations of sardine heads and holly leaves ( hiiragi iwashi) on their house entrances so that bad spirits will not enter. is customarily drunk at Setsubun. ==Historical practices== The new year was felt to be a time when the spirit world became close to the physical world, thus the need to perform mamemaki to drive away any wandering spirits that might happen too close to one's home. Other customs during this time included religious dance, festivals, and bringing tools inside the house that might normally be left outside, to prevent the spirits from harming them. Because Setsubun was considered to be apart from normal time, people might practice role reversal. Such customs included girls doing their hair in the styles of older women and vice versa, wearing disguises, and cross-dressing. This custom is still practiced among geisha and their clients when entertaining on Setsubun. , who were normally shunned during the year because they were considered vagrants, were welcomed on Setsubun to perform morality plays. Their vagrancy worked to their advantage in these cases because they could take the spirits with them. ==Regional variations== While the practice of eating makizushi on Setsubun is historically only associated with the Kansai area of Japan, the practice has become popular nationwide due largely to marketing efforts by grocery and convenience stores. In the Tōhoku area of Japan, the head of the household (traditionally the father) would take roasted beans in his hand, pray at the family shrine, and then toss the sanctified beans out the door. Peanuts (either raw or coated in a sweet, crunchy batter) are sometimes used in place of soybeans. There are many variations on the famous Oni wa soto, fuku wa uchi chant. For example, in the city of Aizuwakamatsu, people chant \\"鬼の目玉ぶっつぶせ！\\" (Oni no medama buttsubuse!), lit. \\"Blind the demons' eyes!\\". ==See also== * Ehōmaki, a sushi roll often eaten for good luck on setsubun. * Exorcism * Feast of the Lemures (a similar Roman custom) * Holidays of Japan * Rikka (立夏) * Risshū (立秋) * Risshun (立春) * Rittō (立冬) * Taoism in Japan * Zvončari (the custom dating to pagan times in Croatia whose goal is to scare away evil spirits of winter and to stir up new springtime cycle) ==References== ==External links== *Japan-guide – Setsubun *Bean scatterer calculator *Japanlinked – Setsubun *Setsubun (Bean Throwing Festival) *Miscellaneous Notes on Setsubun (in Japanese) Category:Buddhism in Japan Category:February observances Category:Buddhist festivals in Japan Category:Oni ","title":"Setsubun"},{"id":"516431","text":"Rayleigh quotient iteration is an eigenvalue algorithm which extends the idea of the inverse iteration by using the Rayleigh quotient to obtain increasingly accurate eigenvalue estimates. Rayleigh quotient iteration is an iterative method, that is, it delivers a sequence of approximate solutions that converges to a true solution in the limit. Very rapid convergence is guaranteed and no more than a few iterations are needed in practice to obtain a reasonable approximation. The Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm converges cubically for Hermitian or symmetric matrices, given an initial vector that is sufficiently close to an eigenvector of the matrix that is being analyzed. == Algorithm == The algorithm is very similar to inverse iteration, but replaces the estimated eigenvalue at the end of each iteration with the Rayleigh quotient. Begin by choosing some value \\\\mu_0 as an initial eigenvalue guess for the Hermitian matrix A. An initial vector b_0 must also be supplied as initial eigenvector guess. Calculate the next approximation of the eigenvector b_{i+1} by b_{i+1} = \\\\frac{(A-\\\\mu_i I)^{-1}b_i}{\\\\(A-\\\\mu_i I)^{-1}b_i\\\\}, where I is the identity matrix, and set the next approximation of the eigenvalue to the Rayleigh quotient of the current iteration equal to \\\\mu_{i+1} = \\\\frac{b^*_{i+1} A b_{i+1}}{b^*_{i+1} b_{i+1}}. To compute more than one eigenvalue, the algorithm can be combined with a deflation technique. Note that for very small problems it is beneficial to replace the matrix inverse with the adjugate, which will yield the same iteration because it is equal to the inverse up to an irrelevant scale (the inverse of the determinant, specifically). The adjugate is easier to compute explicitly than the inverse (though the inverse is easier to apply to a vector for problems that aren't small), and is more numerically sound because it remains well defined as the eigenvalue converges. == Example == Consider the matrix : A = \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 2 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] for which the exact eigenvalues are \\\\lambda_1 = 3+\\\\sqrt5, \\\\lambda_2 = 3-\\\\sqrt5 and \\\\lambda_3 = -2, with corresponding eigenvectors :v_1 = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right], v_2 = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\varphi \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] and v_3 = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right].

Largely based on Andrew Chaikin's 1994 book, A Man on the Moon, the series is known for its accurate telling of the story of Apollo and the special effects under visual director Ernest D. Farino. The series takes its title from, but is not based upon, the 1865 Jules Verne science fiction novel From the Earth to the Moon. Hanks appears in every episode, introducing each of the first eleven. The last episode is represented in a pseudo-documentary format narrated by Blythe Danner, interspersed with a reenactment of the making of Georges Méliès' 1902 film Le Voyage dans la Lune, which was in part inspired by Verne's novel. Hanks narrates and appears in these scenes as Méliès' assistant. ==Cast== The miniseries has a fairly large cast, driven in part by the fact that it portrays 30 of the 32 astronauts who flew, or were preparing to fly, the twelve missions of the Apollo program. (The only two Apollo astronauts not portrayed by credited actors are Apollo 13 Command Module pilot Jack Swigert, who's heard but not seen in Episode 8, and Apollo 17 Command Module pilot Ronald Evans, who had a brief appearance in the liftoff scene of Apollo 17 in the final episode.) Members of many of the astronauts' families, and other NASA and non-NASA personnel, are also portrayed. Several fictional (or fictionalized) characters are also included, notably television newscaster Emmett Seaborn (Lane Smith) who appears in nine of the twelve episodes. Astronaut David Scott, from Apollo 15, was the chief technological consultant. ==Episodes== The twelve episodes, each directed by different individuals, use a variety of viewpoints and themes, while sequentially covering the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. Lane Smith portrays Emmett Seaborn, a seasoned reporter for a fictional television network, who covers the U.S. space program from its earliest days, providing continuity for most of the episodes. {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" - ! 191970; color:#ffffff; width:6%;\\"No. ! 191970; color:#ffffff;\\" Title ! 191970; color:#ffffff;\\" Directed by ! 191970; color:#ffffff;\\" Written by ! 191970; color:#ffffff;\\" Original air date - } ==Integration with existing films== The miniseries, concentrating on the Apollo space program, was produced with an intent not to repeat other dramatic portrayals of events of the space race. Project Mercury, which was portrayed in the 1983 film The Right Stuff, was briefly summarized in the first episode. Miniseries producers Hanks, Howard and Grazer, who had previously produced the 1995 film Apollo 13, shot the episode \\"We Interrupt This Program\\" from the perspective of the media covering that flight, as the film had already covered the story from the point of view of the crew and the mission control team. ==Production information== Many of the actors had opportunity to interact and form friendships with the real life astronauts they were portraying. Brett Cullen, who played Apollo 9 Command Module pilot and Apollo 15 commander David Scott, was invited to the Scott family home each time an episode he appeared in was first televised. Two short clips from the final scenes of Apollo 13 were used in \\"That's All There Is\\"; a splashdown sequence, and a view of the recovery ship USS Iwo Jima (portrayed by USS New Orleans). The original series was shot in Super 35, intended to be viewed on standard television sets of the time in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. With the proliferation of widescreen flat-panel TV sets the series was remastered in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio and re-released in 2005 as a 5-disc DVD box set. As is the case with most material shot in this format, the widescreen framing causes the loss (in some shots) of the top and bottom parts of the frames from the original broadcast, but reveals additional information on the left and right. This is not always noticeable because of careful transfer process, but in some scenes important details are lost. For example, in the first episode, when the Gemini 8 / Agena assembly is tumbling around in space with a stuck thruster, the thruster is not visible in the new widescreen version, as it is cut off by the top of the frame. Some captions have also been compromised. Parts of the mini-series were filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) in Orlando, Florida. Scenes of the moonwalks were shot inside the blimp hangars on the former Marine base in Tustin, California. Approximately half the area inside was converted to the Moon's surface, with the remainder used to hold production trailers. To simulate lunar surface gravity, weather balloons filled with helium were attached to the backs of the actors playing the astronauts in the lunar extravehicular activity scenes, effectively reducing their Earth-bound weights to one-sixth. The score of \\"Spider\\" prominently features an imitation of the main title theme from the 1963 World War II movie The Great Escape, and Tom Kelly jokes about having a crew digging a tunnel out of the Grumman plant. The episode also featured a real Apollo Lunar Module (LM-13), which had been built for the Apollo 18 mission but was never used due to budget cuts. Blythe Danner, who narrated the final episode, had previously worked on location at the Johnson Space Center for the 1976 movie Futureworld, filmed in the same buildings where Apollo moonwalkers had recently trained. ==Awards== The series was nominated for seventeen Emmy awards and won three: Outstanding Miniseries, Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries or a Movie and Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. In addition, the series won a 1999 Golden Globe Award for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV. ==See also== * Apollo 11 in popular culture ==ReferencesCategory:1998 American television series debuts Category:1998 American television series endings Category:1998 in American television Category:1990s American television miniseries Category:American biographical series Category:Best Miniseries or Television Movie Golden Globe winners Category:HBO original programming Category:Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries winners Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series Category:Science docudramas Category:Television shows based on books Category:Television series about the Apollo program Category:Television series based on actual events Category:Television series by Playtone Category:Cultural depictions of Georges Méliès Category:Films scored by Mason Daring Category:Cultural depictions of Buzz Aldrin Category:Cultural depictions of Neil Armstrong Category:Cultural depictions of Michael Collins (astronaut) ","title":"From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)"},{"id":"516438","text":"The 1897 Quebec general election was held on May 11, 1897 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by Félix-Gabriel Marchand, defeated the incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Edmund James Flynn. This marked the start of over 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals. The Conservative Party never held power again in Quebec, and ceased to exist in 1936 when it merged with the Action libérale nationale to form the Union Nationale, which formed a government later that year. Marchand died in office in 1900, and was succeeded by Simon-Napoléon Parent as Liberal leader and premier. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular Vote - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" align=\\"center\\"1892 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change  Félix-Gabriel Marchand align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"21 !align=\\"right\\"51 align=\\"right\\"+143% align=\\"right\\"120,300 align=\\"right\\" 53.28% align=\\"right\\"+9.63%  Edmund James Flynn align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 51 !align=\\"right\\" 23 align=\\"right\\" -54.9% align=\\"right\\"98,941 align=\\"right\\" 43.82% align=\\"right\\" -8.59% colspan=2Other align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"1 !align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"-100% align=\\"right\\"6,538 align=\\"right\\" 2.90% align=\\"right\\"-1.0% - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"73 !align=\\"right\\"74 !align=\\"right\\"+1.4% !align=\\"right\\"225,779 !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"right\\" - } ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 9th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ","title":"1897 Quebec general election"},{"id":"516452","text":"A minigame (also spelled mini-game or mini game, sometimes called a subgame or microgame) is a short video game often contained within another video game, and sometimes in application software or on a display of any form of hardware. A minigame contains different gameplay elements than the main game, may be optional, and is often smaller or more simplistic than the game in which it is contained. Minigames are sometimes also offered separately for free to promote the main game. Some minigames can also be bonus stages or secret levels. == Features == Minigames occur variously as gameplay features, or as time fillers while levels are loading, or as Easter eggs even in non video games e.g. a DOOM-like game or a flight simulator in different versions of Microsoft Excel. In the latter case, they are often called \\"secret games\\". In the former case, the successful completion of such minigames may or may not be required to finish the encompassing game. They are often included as extra content to use once the main storyline is completed. Minigames occur also on other forms of hardware e.g. on a dot-matrix display of a pinball machine or even as time filler on a traffic light e.g. StreetPong. === Minigame compilations === Some games, such as the WarioWare series (which are called microgames in the game), Universal Research Laboratories's Video Action, some Cinemaware titles like Defender of the Crown, David Whittaker's Lazy Jones or the smartphone satire Phone Story are made up of many minigames strung together into one video game. Some similar games, such as Nintendo's Mario Party series, are considered party games, specifically developed for multiplayer. In party games, minigames usually involve performing an activity faster or collecting more of a specified item than other players to win. == Notable examples == The Legend of Zelda games have many minigames in each game, often having prizes such as Pieces of Heart (increasing Link's health), Rupees (the games' currency), and upgrades (quiver, wallet, etc.) The Final Fantasy series is notable for featuring minigames in every entry of the series, ever since the first Final Fantasy (1987), in which a sliding puzzle in the form of an Easter egg can be unlocked while boarding the ship. Considered to be the first RPG minigame, it was added into the game by programmer Nasir Gebelli despite it not being part of Squaresoft's original game design. In Final Fantasy II (1988), a matching game can be unlocked while boarding the ice sled and meeting a certain requirement. Later in the series, Final Fantasy VII (1997) was the first video game to include within it at least thirty minigames, which remains the largest number of minigames for a role-playing game. The PC game Chronomaster featured similar puzzle minigames which were crucial to the plot. The early Sonic the Hedgehog games on the Sega Genesis had minigame bonus/special stages, such as bouncing around a maze searching for a special gem, or collecting gold rings while running down a tube, and stray from standard gameplay. Sonic the Hedgehog 3, for example, has a special stage in which Sonic must run around trying to touch all the blue spheres, while avoiding red ones, and interacting with other spheres, who have special properties. This bonus stage actually became its own game. By inserting the original Sonic 1 (or Sonic Classics 3 in 1) cartridge into the Sonic and Knuckles lock-on slot, you can then press A, B, and C, then enter any given password to play the special stage corresponding to that password, which plays exactly like those of Sonic 3. Like above, some minigames become so popular that they are eventually published as individual titles by themselves. Notable examples are Geometry Wars, which was originally a minigame in Project Gotham Racing 2, and Arcomage, a relatively complex minigame, reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering, first introduced in Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor. The PocketStation (for Sony PlayStation) and VMU (for Dreamcast) accessories allowed the user to download minigames from the main console onto the pocket device, and often then sync progress in the minigame back on to the console. Two examples of this include the Chocobo World minigame inside Final Fantasy VIIIFFVIII PocketStation Opens Up Chocobo World , IGN, July 15, 1999 (which is also playable on PC), and 'Chao Adventure', a minigame in Sonic Adventure. Another example is the minigames of Five nights at freddy, that shows facts for the game. == References == == See also == * Casual game * Invade-a-Load * Minigames of Final Fantasy * Party game Category:Video game gameplay Category:Video game terminology Category:Video game levels Category:Minigames ","title":"Minigame"},{"id":"516456","text":"This list of bridges in Canada is organized by province and territory. ==Alberta== *Athabasca River Bridge - Fort McMurray *Beverly Bridge − Edmonton *Briggs Bridge - Briggs *Capilano Bridge − Edmonton *Centre Street Bridge − Calgary *Clover Bar Bridge − Edmonton *Dawson Bridge − Edmonton *Dudley B.

She is Tony Soprano's elder sister. A young Janice has appeared in flashbacks, played by Madeline Blue and Juliet Fox. ==Background== As the oldest child of mobster Johnny Boy Soprano and Livia Sopranohttps://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/cast-and-crew/janice-soprano in a household financed by crime, Janice grew complacent of her family's criminal ties. For example, \\"Johnny Boy\\" took Janice to an amusement park where other mobsters and their daughters were. The mobsters used this as a cover to conduct criminal activities until they eventually get busted (and Janice witnesses a cop shoot a mobster). Both her brother and uncle recall times when even as a child, Janice had a very callous nature. At ten years old she is suspected of stealing money from Junior Soprano's wallet after visiting the Soprano home. She also had a rebellious side and as an adult, she gets a Rolling Stones tattoo on her breast and is placed on an Unwanted Persons list by Canada, which she was permanently banned from entering. While working at Kenny Rogers Roasters she once waited on NFL player Barry Sanders. After graduating Sacred Heart High School (New Jersey), Janice joined an ashram in Venice, Los Angeles, legally changing her name to \\"Parvati Wasatch\\" in 1978. \\"Parvati\\" also traveled across Europe, staying in Paris, France and Sri Lanka, married a French-Canadian Quebecer named Eugene, with whom she had a son named Harpo (\\"Hal\\") born in Seattle, Washington named after the song \\"Harpo's Blues\\" by Phoebe Snow. His father later took him back to Montreal and Janice states that she tried to petition the State Department to have him returned to her, but was unsuccessful. She worked as a furniture mover, and worked at an espresso bar in Olympia, Washington before finally moving back to New Jersey permanently. She is given a full disability pension. Since moving back home, she gradually refashions herself from an aging rebel to an upscale, materialistic, North Jersey Italian housewife. Janice is also a chronic malingerer. Described by her sister-in-law, Carmela, \\"she has no work ethic\\". Janice claimed she developed carpal tunnel syndrome while operating the steamed milk machine at a Seattle espresso bar, in order to claim disability benefits. She conveniently claimed she had the Epstein–Barr virus to justify sleeping, as an escape from performing her duties as a wife and stepmother. She also took out a home equity loan on Livia Soprano's house, claiming to use the money to help finance care for her ailing mother. Her relationship with Tony is often strained, as he still holds her responsible for abandoning the family and leaving him to deal with their abusive mother alone. ==Biography== In season two, Janice returns to Newark, New Jersey, ostensibly to take care of her sick mother. Her high school boyfriend, Richie Aprile, is a DiMeo crime family Capo who is released from prison around the same time. When Tony and Richie begin feuding, Janice exacerbates the situation by telling Richie that he is being unfairly treated and even suggests making a move against Tony. Richie is initially reluctant to do so. Richie is causing problems for Tony that are only made more complicated by his engagement to Janice. Tony is unhappy with the engagement, and both Janice and Richie flaunt their status to Tony by planning an extravagant wedding and putting an offer on an expensive house in Short Hills, New Jersey despite him still having a no-show job working as a fishmonger. Tony orders Richie killed after Uncle Junior had informed him of Richie's plan to \\"move against him\\". However, after an incident of domestic violence in which Richie punches her in the face, Janice shoots and kills Richie and calls on her brother to dispose of the body. She then moves back to Seattle and becomes briefly engaged to a 19-year-old. In season three, Janice again returns to New Jersey following the death of her mother. After Livia's death, Janice becomes obsessed with acquiring her mother's valuable record collection, which Livia gave to her nurse, Svetlana, shortly before her death. Janice, feeling that she should rightfully have the records, absconds with Svetlana's prosthetic leg. She tells Svetlana that the leg would not be returned until she received the records. Svetlana, however, has friends connected with the Russian Mafia physically assault Janice until she reveals the location of the leg. Tony visits her at the hospital and angrily tells her that since she had been assaulted, he is now forced to retaliate and risk facing a war with the Russians or else lose respect. Bewildered by the sudden turn in her fortunes, she briefly becomes a born- again Christian. Janice's next phase is marked by a brief interest in a Christian music career, as well as an equally brief live-in relationship with narcoleptic boyfriend, Aaron Arkaway. After the death of Jackie Aprile, Jr., Janice embarks on a clandestine relationship with Ralph Cifaretto in season four who is in a relationship with Jackie's mother, Rosalie Aprile. With the help of her feminist therapist, Janice soon reaches the conclusion that her affair with Ralph is a mistake, and after Ralph happily tells her that he is no longer seeing Rosalie Aprile and plans to move in with her; Janice responds by flying into a rage, pushing him down a flight of stairs and screaming at him to leave. Sometime later, Tony asks Janice about Ralph's bizarre sexual fetishes, of which he had recently become aware. She refuses to tell him anything at first, ostensibly to protect Ralph's privacy. When Tony offers her money, however, she immediately tells him everything he wants to know. Following Ralph's disappearance, Janice sets her sights on the newly widowed Bobby Baccalieri, another of Tony's caporegimes, whose fidelity to his wife while she was alive, and obvious adoration of her after her death, makes him especially appealing. Initially, Janice serves Bobby's dinners (sometimes claiming other women's plates as her own) and informally dates him. Frustrated with Bobby's refusal to commit, she sends Bobby's children instant messages via her Mac, choosing a user name that appeared satanic, and indicating that she was watching them by referring to objects in their living room (which she could see from her window). This ploy scares them badly, in response to which she subsequently rushed over to help comfort them and curry favor with their bewildered father. Although mainly acting out of her desires, she does help Bobby by pushing him to do a task for her uncle Junior that he has been putting off due to grief. She also attends her uncle's racketeering trial and assists Bobby with taking care of Junior. By the beginning of season five, Janice and Bobby are married. She is shown having a difficult relationship with her stepchildren. She attacks a soccer player's mother at Sophia's Peewee soccer match and injures her badly enough to require hospitalization, garnering her an assault charge and, to Tony's displeasure, unwanted TV news coverage mentioning his name and line of work. Bobby also insists that she attend anger management counseling. While it briefly has the desired effect, Tony, in doubt and jealous of Janice's new found peace of mind, intentionally provokes her with insults over her missing son, sending her once again into an angry rage. By season six, Janice and Bobby have a baby girl together, Domenica. Janice encourages Tony to officially let Bobby take over Junior's old crew which causes the two to have an angry argument. One day when neither Janice or Bobby can look after a mentally-declining Junior, Tony angrily volunteers. Confusing Tony for an associate he ordered murdered years ago, he shoots Tony in the gut. Janice visits an unconscious Tony at the hospital, but instantly breaks down when seeing Tony's physical state. In the episode \\"Moe n' Joe\\", Janice is seen as a commanding force in the household, setting boundaries for both Bobby Jr and Bobby Sr. Janice confronts Tony about his treatment of Bobby, and Tony refuses to say what the siblings both knew: Tony blames Bobby (and Janice, to some extent) for his near-fatal shooting by Junior. He angrily confides to Dr. Melfi that Janice \\"gets nothing\\" because she didn't have the scars he did from having to deal with and take care of their mother alone while Janice left New Jersey as soon as she graduated high school. Later in the episode, Tony lets go of his hostility and compensates Janice and Bobby by convincing an imprisoned John Sacrimoni to sell them his large house at half price. Tony also grows closer to Bobby, with Tony entrusting him with more responsibility and Bobby becoming a trusted money maker as a result. Janice and Bobby inherit the late Bobby, Sr.'s cottage in northern New York state, to which they invite Tony and Carmela for Tony's 47th birthday. At the party, Janice gives Tony a gift of Soprano family home videos and tells Carmela an anecdote that embarrasses Tony when it is raised again during a heated, drunken game of Monopoly: Janice and Tony's father once angrily shot a bullet through Livia's beehive hairdo. Bobby later loses his temper and punches Tony in the face after Tony makes offensive remarks about Janice, leading to a fight which Bobby wins (much to Tony's chagrin). As revenge, Tony orders Bobby, who has never killed anyone, to go to Canada and carry out a contract killing. Defending Janice's honor increases Tony's regard for Bobby, as he is soon elevated into Tony's inner circle (largely displacing Christopher Moltisanti). Janice suggests to Tony that he help pay to keep Uncle Junior -- whose money has run out -- in a private care facility, but is rebuffed by Tony, who makes it clear Junior is dead to him. Angered by Janice and Bobby's perceived disloyalty, Tony tells her that he is also going to exile Bobby from his life, although this is just an empty threat. Soon after that conversation, Janice becomes a widow; Bobby is murdered by two of Phil Leotardo's hit men while buying a model train in a hobby store. Tony visits her afterwards, and after a brief conversation assures her that he is there for her if she needs him. Bobby III and Sophia's paternal grandmother wants to raise them, while Janice wants to keep them with her and Domenica. Their fate remains unknown, although the two have previously shown contempt for Janice. Janice's other focus seems to be on whatever assets she might receive such as those from Uncle Junior, prompting Tony to make a deal with \\"Uncle Pat\\" ensuring Junior's estate will go into a trust that will benefit Bobby's children and not Janice. Tony also extracts a promise from Phil Leotardo's men to pay a settlement to Janice, after Phil's vendetta against Tony led to Bobby's murder. == References == ==External links== * HBO Profile: Janice Soprano Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Fictional feminist characters Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Buddhism in fiction Category:Fictional housewives Category:Fictional smokers sv:Lista över rollfigurer i Sopranos#Janice Soprano ","title":"Janice Soprano"},{"id":"516463","text":"The Return of the King (also known as The Return of the King: A Story of the Hobbits), is a 1980 animated musical television film created by Rankin/Bass and Topcraft. The film is an adaptation of the 1955 The Return of the King, the third and final volume of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. Due to marketing by Warner Bros., the film is often credited by fans as the unofficial sequel to Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film The Lord of the Rings, which is based on the first two volumes of the book. According to rumors, Rankin/Bass decided to do the project upon hearing that Bakshi's sequel finishing The Lord of the Rings was going to be left unmade. However, Rankin/Bass had always planned on making a sequel based on The Return of the King as their follow-up project to The Hobbit.J.W. Braun, The Lord of the Films (ECW Press, 2009) The special aired on ABC on Sunday, May 11, 1980 after a legal challenge filed by the Tolkien Estate and Fantasy Films was settled. Critical and fan reaction to The Return of the King was lukewarm.Tolkien Online: The Return of the King ==Plot== During the 129th birthday celebration for Bilbo Baggins in Rivendell, Frodo begins his story with Samwise Gamgee, his friend and companion, treading through Mordor as Ring-bearer in Frodo's absence, when Frodo is captive in the orc fortress of Cirith Ungol. During his journey, Sam ponders claiming the Ring himself; but rejects the idea and rescues Frodo. Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf the White and the hobbit Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the Steward of the Throne, about the upcoming war—only to discover that the Steward has become insane and means to take his own life. Frodo and Samwise continue toward Mount Doom (eluding Ringwraiths and infiltrating a \\"battalion of orcs\\" in the process) only to be attacked by Gollum. As Sam holds Gollum off, Frodo reaches the Crack of Doom; but is subverted by the Ring. At the same time, Gondor's neighboring country, Rohan, helps it claim victory in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, where King Théoden and the Witch-King of Angmar are slain. Upon his own arrival, Aragorn plans to confront Sauron at the gates of Mordor. Here, he quarrels with the Mouth of Sauron and the two armies prepare for battle. After days of searching for Frodo in Mount Doom, Sam discovers Gollum and Frodo fighting over the Ring, which results in Gollum biting off Frodo's finger to claim it. While dancing with joy at the retrieval of his \\"Precious\\", Gollum falls into Mount Doom's magma chamber, taking the Ring with him, and Sauron perishes. Sam and Frodo are rescued by the Eagles from the erupting Mount Doom. A few months later, Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor. The story concludes with Frodo agreeing to accompany Bilbo, Gandalf, and Elrond as they leave Middle-earth. He gives the Red Book (consisting of Bilbo's memoirs with some spare pages) to Sam, assuring him that a good life is still in store for him. Gandalf assures them that hobbits shall someday have descendants among humans, to preserve their own existence; and the film terminates in Frodo's departure from the Grey Havens. ==Voices== * Orson Bean – Frodo, Bilbo * Theodore Bikel – Aragorn * William Conrad – Denethor * John Huston – Gandalf * Roddy McDowall – Sam * Brother Theodore – Gollum * Paul Frees – Elrond, Orc, Uruk-hai * Don Messick – Théoden, Easterling, The Mouth of Sauron * John Stephenson – Lord of the Nazgul, Gondorian Guard * Casey Kasem – Merry * Sonny Melendrez – Pippin * Nellie Bellflower – Éowyn * Glenn Yarbrough – The Minstrel ==Production== After the broadcast of The Hobbit on ABC, development and production began on The Return of the King at Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City under supervision of Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass.

Orson Bean returned as the voice of the older Bilbo Baggins, as well as that of the story's hero, Frodo Baggins. John Huston came back as well, as the wizard Gandalf, and co-starring with them were: William Conrad as Denethor, Roddy McDowall as Samwise Gamgee, Theodore Bikel as Aragorn, and reprising his role of Gollum, Brother Theodore. Rankin/Bass stalwart Paul Frees replaced the late Cyril Ritchard as the voice of Elrond; Casey Kasem, best known for his role as Shaggy in Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo, was Merry, with Sonny Melendrez as Pippin; Nellie Bellflower as Éowyn; and Glenn Yarbrough returned as principal vocalist, billed here as simply \\"the Minstrel of Gondor\\". Thurl Ravenscroft also served in the chorus. Once the character voices were recorded, along with background music by Maury Laws with Jules Bass writing songs and lyrics for the film, the animation production was done by Topcraft in Japan under supervision of Toru Hara, Tsuguyuki Kubo, Kazuyuki Kobayashi and other animation department members. The release was threatened by a lawsuit filed by the Tolkien Estate and Fantasy Films on the basis that Rankin/Bass had not secured the U.S. and Canadian television rights to the book. The lawsuit was settled \\"amicably\\", allowing it to proceed with a May 1980 release. ==Reception== The film has garnered mixed reviews from modern sources. Charles Cassidy of Common Sense Media gave it a score of 3/5, and said, \\"Cartoon tale is darker, more complex than others in series\\". Steven D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide gave it a C, and said, \\"Works even less well than The Hobbit, which really is a children's story… overbearing folk- ballad soundtrack doesn't even gesture lyrically to Tolkien's poetry\\". It currently holds a score of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes. Director Arthur Rankin Jr. later stated, \\"We tried to do Return of the King... but it is an awful lot to put into it. I think [Peter] Jackson is having the same problem in his films. You can't deviate from these books, or somebody'll wait on the street for you! ...The Return of the King, we had to summarize what had happened before, and then put it all together in 2 hours. It's not a very good film.\\" Asked why he chose only to make The Return of the King, instead of making the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, Rankin admitted, \\"I didn't know that the audience would sit still for it. I was wrong.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZe6OhmPnx8 ==Home media== The Return of the King was first released on VHS by Warner Home Video in 1991, and for the second time as part of the \\"Warner Bros. Classic Tales\\" video collection in 1996. The film has been available on DVD since 2001, both individually and as a \\"boxed trilogy\\" with the Rankin/Bass's The Hobbit and Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings. ==References* Screen captures from the CED edition.

The film is an adaptation of the 1937 book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien, and was first broadcast on NBC in the United States on Sunday, November 27, 1977. ==Plot== The plot of the animated production is in most respects similar to that of the book; but certain plot points are significantly compressed or removed due to the time limitations of the format. In addition, certain scenes are obviously edited for commercial breaks. In general, alterations are confined to simple omission of detail, and the story follows the source text. The lyrics of the songs are adapted from songs in the book, but are generally longer. ==Background== The film was produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass of Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City, and was adapted for the screen by Romeo Muller, with Rankin taking on the additional duties of production designer. When interviewed for the film, Rankin declared that he would add nothing to the story that wasn't in the original.Culhan, John. Will the Video Version of Tolkien Be Hobbit Forming? The New York Times, Nov 27, 1977. The New York Times reported that The Hobbit cost $3 million. In a 2003 interview, Rankin stated, \\"I love the Tolkien work,\\" and explained that he was able to make the film because The Hobbit was still in the public domain at the time, despite claims to the contrary from the copyright holders.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZe6OhmPnx8 The story's hero, Bilbo Baggins, is voiced by Orson Bean, backed up by noted Hollywood director and actor John Huston as the voice of Gandalf. In supporting roles, the comedian and performance artist Brother Theodore was chosen for the voice of Gollum, and Thurl Ravenscroft performed the baritone singing voices of the goblins. The gravelly voice of the dragon Smaug was provided by Richard Boone, with Hans Conried as Thorin Oakenshield, rounding out the cast of primarily American voice actors. The film was the final Rankin/Bass project to star the Australian actor Cyril Ritchard, here playing the voice of Elrond. The Hobbit was animated by Topcraft in Tokyo, a now-defunct Japanese animation studio whose animation team re-formed as Studio Ghibli under Hayao Miyazaki, while some of the animators went to establish Pacific Animation Corporation. Topcraft successfully partnered with Rankin/Bass on several other productions in traditional animation, including 'Twas the Night Before Christmas (1974), The Stingiest Man in Town (1978) and The Last Unicorn (1982). According to Rankin, the visual style of the film took its basic cue from the early illustrations of Arthur Rackham. While Topcraft produced the animation overseas, the concept artwork was completed at the Rankin/Bass studio under the direction of Arthur Rankin. The Rhode Island-based artist Lester Abrams did the initial designs for most of the characters; Rankin had seen Abrams' illustrations to an excerpt from The Hobbit in Children's Digest. Principal artists included coordinating animator Toru Hara; supervising animator/character designer Tsuguyuki Kubo; character and effects animators Hidetoshi Kaneko and Kazuko Ito; and background designer Minoru Nishida. The same studio and crew members were also used for The Return of the King. Harry N. Abrams published a large coffee-table illustrated edition of the book featuring concept art and stills. ==Soundtrack and story LP== Jules Bass primarily adapted Tolkien's original lyrics for the film's musical interludes, drawn primarily from the songs that feature prominently in the book. He also assisted Maury Laws, Rankin/Bass's composer and conductor-in-residence, in the composition of an original theme song, \\"The Greatest Adventure (The Ballad of the Hobbit)\\", sung by Glenn Yarbrough as the sole original song written for the film. This folk ballad came to be associated with Yarbrough, who reprised it in the soundtrack to 1980 animated film The Return of the King. The Hobbit first aired as an animated television special in 1977 with the goal of producing an accompanying tie-in storybook and song recordings for children, as in other Rankin/Bass productions. The Hobbit was released on LP with the soundtrack and dialogue from the film was also released in 1977 by Disney through its Buena Vista Records label, and an edited version, along with accompanying \\"storyteller read-alongs\\", was later issued for the Mouse Factory's Disneyland Records imprint. A second music album by Glenn Yarbrough of music \\"inspired\\" by The Hobbit was also released. ===Original Soundtrack Songs=== \\"Rankin / Bass Featuring Glenn Yarbrough – The Hobbit: Original Soundtrack Songs\\", Discogs. Retrieved on 9 August 2015. ==Critical reception== In 1978, Romeo Muller won a Peabody Award for his teleplay for The Hobbit. The film was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, but lost to Star Wars. A few days before its first airing, John J. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times that \\"Rankin and Bass Productions have now carefully translated 'The Hobbit' into film. The result is curiously eclectic, but filled with nicely effective moments. […] The drawings frequently suggest strong resemblances to non-Tolkien characters… The goblins could have stepped out of a Maurice Sendak book. But […] the Dragon and Gollum the riddle aficionado bring some clever original touches… Whatever its flaws, this television version of 'The Hobbit' warrants attention.\\" Criticism primarily focused on adaptation issues, including the unfamiliar style of artwork used by the Japanese-American co-production team, whereas some Tolkien fans questioned the appropriateness of repackaging the material as a family film for a very young audience. Douglas A. Anderson, a Tolkien scholar, called the adaptation \\"execrable\\" in his own introduction to The Annotated Hobbit, although he did not elaborate;Anderson. Douglas A. The Annotated Hobbit and a few critics said it was confusing for those not already familiar with the plot.Kask, TJ, \\"NBC's The Hobbit\\", Dragon Magazine, December 1977. On the other hand, critic Tom Keogh praised the adaptation as \\"excellent\\", saying the work received \\"big points\\" for being \\"faithful to Tolkien's story\\" and that the \\"vocal cast can't be improved upon.\\" Director Arthur Rankin Jr. was proud of The Hobbit, and in an interview in 2003 he described it as \\"a good film\\", stating that the simplicity of the story made it easy to adapt to the screen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZe6OhmPnx8 Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 67% based on reviews from 15 critics. ==Sequel== Before The Hobbit aired on NBC, Rankin/Bass and its partner animation houses were preparing a sequel. Meanwhile, United Artists released J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings in 1978, an animated adaptation directed by Ralph Bakshi, originally intended as the first part in a two-part film. United Artists's sequel having been cancelled after a disagreement with Bakshi, Rankin/Bass proceeded to produce a television installment of The Lord of the Rings, bringing back most of the animation team and voice cast. Taking elements from the last volume of The Lord of the Rings which had not been used by Bakshi, they developed the musical The Return of the King. They were unable to provide continuity for the missing segments, developing instead a framing device in which both films begin and end with Bilbo's stay at Rivendell, connecting the later film directly to the better-received Hobbit. ==Voices== * Orson Bean – Bilbo Baggins * Richard Boone – Smaug * Hans Conried – Thorin Oakenshield * John Huston – Gandalf / Narrator * Otto Preminger – The Elvenking * Cyril Ritchard – Elrond * Brother Theodore – Gollum * Paul Frees – Bombur, Troll #1 * Jack DeLeon – Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Óin, Glóin, Ori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, Troll #2 * Don Messick – Balin, Goblin, Lord of the Eagles, Troll #3 * John Stephenson – Dori, Bard, Great Goblin * Glenn Yarbrough – The Balladeer * Thurl Ravenscroft – Goblin (singing voice), Background voice ==Crew== * Producers/Directors – Arthur Rankin Jr., Jules Bass * Writer – Romeo Muller * Based on \\"The Hobbit\\" – J.

The General Secretary of the CPSU, who was also a Politburo member, was the leader of the Secretariat and of the Party. Dual membership in the Secretariat and the Politburo was in practice reserved for two or three very senior members of the Soviet leadership, and in the post- Stalin era (after March 1953) was a stepping-stone to ultimate power. The last five Soviet leaders (Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Mikhail Gorbachev) were all senior Secretaries before becoming First or General Secretaries. Additionally, Georgy Malenkov was briefly reckoned as the leader of the Party for a week after Stalin's death by virtue of being the top member of the Secretariat. The Central Committee established the Secretariat on 6 August 1917; it initially comprised Felix Dzerzhinsky, Matvei Muranov and Yakov Sverdlov as full members and Adolph Joffe and Elena Stasova as candidate members (or alternates). Following the October Revolution of November 1917, Sverdlov and Stasova in effect handled the work of the Secretariat as the other members of the body assumed other duties. At the time, the Secretariat wasAlan Bullock, Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives, p. 121-124. responsible for technical issues such as coordination of the activities of regional Party organizations and handling routine administrative affairs of the Party. Its staff increased from just 30 in 1919 to 600 in 1921 and to 767 by 1925. By 1922, the body had transformed from a technical committee to become one of the most important components of the Party, and from that point on it was responsible for day-to-day operations of the Communist Party. Also in 1922, the position of General Secretary was created, the General Secretary became the head of the Secretariat and, in the years following Lenin's death in 1924, became the most important figure in the Party and in the Soviet Union. ==See also== * Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union * Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR == References == ==Further reading== * Bibliography of the Russian Revolution and Civil War * Bibliography of Stalinism and the Soviet Union * Bibliography of the Post Stalinist Soviet Union Category:Bodies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Category:Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members ","title":"Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"},{"id":"516478","text":"Robert Baccalieri Jr., played by Steven R. Schirripa, is a fictional character on the HBO series The Sopranos. He is nicknamed \\"Bobby Baccalà\\", baccalà being an Italian dish made from dried and salted cod. A mobster, Bobby is first shown as one of the soldiers and then later top aides to Corrado \\"Junior\\" Soprano. Throughout the series, he rises through the ranks of the organized crime organization, becoming a capo, as well as Tony Soprano's brother-in-law. ==Biography== In the episode \\"In Camelot\\", Bobby Baccalieri Jr. attends Livia Soprano's funeral and says that he was \\"very distraught\\" over hearing of Livia Soprano's passing. In \\"Soprano Home Movies,\\" when discussing Bobby Baccalieri after the fight, Tony Soprano thought he was 42 or 43 making him born in 1964 or 1965. Bobby Sr. fathered Bobby Jr. at 31 or 32 years old. In the episode \\"Soprano Home Movies\\", Bobby states his grandfather had emigrated from Italy to the United States through Montreal. In \\"For All Debts Public and Private\\", Bobby mentions that in 2002 his mother is 69 and that following the September 11 attacks her mental health has gone downhill. It is also implied that his parents are separated or divorced. Bobby, unlike many of his fellow wiseguys, was big-hearted and quite shy. He ran Junior Soprano's old loan shark business. Although not officially a captain until much later, Bobby was a high-ranking soldier who ran Junior Soprano's old crew and reported directly to Junior, and later to Tony. Before his death, it was thought he was being groomed for the job of boss if Tony were to be killed or arrested. Bobby was the son of Bobby Baccalieri Sr., a highly respected mobster (whom Tony referred to as \\"a real terminator\\"), who fronted as a barber. Bobby's father appeared in \\"Another Toothpick\\" played by Burt Young, suffering from lung cancer, who returned from retirement when Tony gave him the order to murder Salvatore \\"Mustang Sally\\" Intile, Bobby Sr.'s godson, in Staten Island. The hit was ordered as retribution for the savage unprovoked beating of Bryan Spatafore, brother of Vito Spatafore. Bobby Sr. died after losing control of his car and crashing into a signpost while leaving the scene of the Mustang Sally hit, which Bobby found very distressing. Before joining Junior Soprano's crew Bobby was a head waiter until at least 1986 and was groomed by his father, Bobby Sr. At some point, Bobby became a made man, although without making his bones (committing murder). Bobby was married to Karen Baccalieri and lived in Verona, New Jersey until her death in a car crash, and they had two children, Bobby III and Sophia. Bobby was quite different from the other men in the Soprano crime family. Within the family he was quiet, almost shy, kind-hearted and even-tempered; these traits made him well liked, if not necessarily respected. He was obese, which brought him much ridicule, but he was very loyal and even Tony apologized to him after making cracks about his weight. In turn, Bobby was always respectful, and sometimes affectionate, towards Tony, telling him, \\"I always liked you\\", in the aftermath of a feud that saw Tony order the deaths of several members of Junior Soprano's crew that Bobby was in. He bore no lasting grudges against Paulie Gualtieri or Christopher Moltisanti, who carried out these hits, and appeared briefly looking delighted on the day Christopher became a made man. Bobby operated Junior Soprano's loan shark business in his stead and acted as Junior's assistant while Junior was under house arrest on federal racketeering charges. Junior eventually rewarded him by putting Bobby in charge of his loan shark operation during the later part of his prosecution. Bobby was made acting capo when Junior had Murf Lupo step down in \\"For All Debts Public and Private\\". Bobby was very loyal to his wife, Karen, and (as revealed in \\"Christopher\\") was the only made man in the Soprano crew without a comare. The only time he was ever seen with another woman other than his wife was in the episode \\"University.\\" When Ralphie walks back into the Bada Bing after beating Tracee to death, Bobby could be seen talking to another stripper. However, Bobby lost his wife in a car accident and took it especially hard. Following Karen's death, Janice Soprano, along with many other women, pursued Bobby, trying to help him out as much as possible (with cooking and watching over Bobby's two children) but also trying to initiate a relationship with him. When his grief continued, Janice went so far as to use the internet to expose his children to a Ouija board within their house. This frightened them and cleared a path for Janice to demonstrate that Bobby's grief was affecting his children. Despite Bobby's initial reluctance, the two were soon married and together had a daughter, Domenica. Bobby remained unaware of his wife's machinations at the start of their relationship. Bobby also enjoyed playing with model trains. Since 2001, when he assisted Tony in rescuing Christopher Moltisanti and Paulie Gualtieri from the Pine Barrens, Bobby had grown closer to Tony. Additionally, as Ralph Cifaretto put it, \\"Dating the boss's sister will help a made man's career\\"; nevertheless, Tony had recently stepped up his expectations of Bobby, who he felt was taking their newfound family relationship as an excuse not to earn at a competitive level, compared to other members of the family. Bobby rose to the occasion by supplementing his income with $7,000 he received for using his skills as a marksman to non- fatally shoot a rapper he met at the hospital in the buttocks, while Tony was in the ICU, in order to raise the rapper's profile. In the episode \\"The Ride\\" Bobby's wife, son and youngest daughter were involved in a ride accident at the feast of St. Elzear, while he took his other daughter to the bathroom. Bobby's initial reaction was relief that his family was unhurt. However, at a Sunday dinner at the Soprano residence, Janice berated Bobby for not standing up for them. She later accompanied him when he paid a visit to the ride's owner. Bobby stormed into his motel room, beat him up and tried to extort money from him but learned that Paulie Gualtieri had been responsible for withholding the funds needed to repair the ride. Bobby tracked Paulie down at the festival and angrily confronted him; the two were separated by other associates in the crime family. At Christopher's belated bachelor party, Bobby left soon after Paulie arrived. Tony ordered Paulie to make things right with Bobby. The episode demonstrated Bobby's devotion to his family, but also confirmed his credentials as a man not to be crossed lightly, further cementing his position in the higher echelons of Tony's crew. In the episode, \\"Moe N' Joe\\", Bobby was beaten and robbed by a street gang as he was making his collections. One of the gang members fired a shot at the sidewalk near Bobby's face and a concrete fragment injured his right eye. The injury left his sight in the eye uncertain and Carlo suspected that he may need a corneal transplantation. Despite the injury, Bobby made certain his payments reached Tony, by way of a concerned Carlo Gervasi, who visited Bobby at the hospital. Bobby's injury prompted Tony to reassess his relationship with his sister and brother-in-law. Tony's feelings of guilt prompted him to broker an agreement with Johnny Sack that allowed Bobby and his family to buy Sack's house at half price. In the episode \\"Soprano Home Movies\\", during a Monopoly game with Bobby, Carmela, and Janice, Tony began to make rude remarks towards Janice in reference to her promiscuous behavior as a younger woman, which Bobby took as a disrespectful affront. Unexpectedly, a usually meek and passive Bobby launched his fist into Tony's face, knocking him to the floor. Bobby won the fight, battering the inebriated Tony quite severely but also injuring his boss's pride. Tony, although reasonably gracious in defeat, was embarrassed at having been defeated in a brawl (especially by Bobby of all people) and frequently asserted to Bobby, Janice, and Carmela that he would have won the fight had he not slipped on the rug nor undergone such physical impotence after being shot by Uncle Junior. As a partial result of this awkward incident, Bobby was tasked with going to Montreal to murder the brother-in-law of one of Tony's Québécois associates, an important hit that formed part of a deal to save money on a pharmaceuticals racket. It was Bobby's first murder; Tony mentioned earlier that Bobby had never \\"popped his cherry\\" with wetwork though Bobby was quite remorseful after committing the hit. Bobby's attitude was also affected by Tony's plan to promote him to Acting Boss. Tony wanted to bring Bobby up into the administration of the organization, because his earlier plan of positioning Christopher Moltisanti as his emissary and eventual heir had failed, following their personal falling out. While Paulie Walnuts nominally held the title of Underboss, Bobby attended high-level meetings and sit-downs alongside Tony and Silvio Dante, identifying him as a high-ranking capo. Even though Bobby was just a capo at the time, he was still consulted in strategy sessions, such as when Tony consulted Bobby about what to do about Phil Leotardo's attempts to displace him as boss of the family. A few years earlier, Tony would have never brought Bobby into such a high-level discussion. And unlike Moltisanti, Bobby neither took Tony's trust for granted nor his new position lightly. Conscious of his abrupt rise from low level soldier to top Capo, and 'de facto' underboss, Bobby actually worked hard to keep Tony's trust and respect, rather than simply coasting on his goodwill as Moltisanti had, and his loyalty and work ethic did not go unnoticed or unappreciated by Tony. Bobby's rise and industriousness did not go unnoticed by the other families, either. When his name was brought up at meeting of top New York associates and one of them mocked his rise by noting that he'd originally been Junior Soprano's driver, Albie Cianflone defended Bobby, noting that almost all mafiosi started doing work considered low-level or menial. When war erupted between the New Jersey and New York families in the episode \\"The Blue Comet\\", New York boss Phil Leotardo ordered the deaths of the DiMeo family's top three \\"guys\\": Bobby, Silvio, and Tony. FBI agent Dwight Harris informed Tony at Satriale's that a snitch in Brooklyn had implied that Phil had ordered a major hit on the New Jersey crew. Tony then gave orders to inform everyone of the upcoming assassination plot. Bobby left his cell phone behind as he entered a hobby shop, preventing him from receiving the warning call. While Bobby was looking at a vintage Blue Comet train set, two men entered the store and opened fire. Several gunshots sent Bobby's riddled body crashing on top of a model train display. Later in the episode, when a saddened Tony reflects on Bobby's death, while holding the assault rifle that Bobby gave him on his birthday, Tony flashes back to the moment when he and Bobby were fishing, contemplating their own fates. Bobby observes that when getting killed, you \\"probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?\\" With Janice now a widow, she asks Uncle Junior for money, now living in state care but the attempt fails as Junior's advancing dementia has made him forget where his secret funds are hidden. Tony, although estranged from Junior, later visits his uncle and firmly tells him that if he does recall where his money is, that the money go straight to Bobby's children, with Tony overseeing it. ==Character origins== By chance, Steve Schirripa was in New York City in June 1999 for a friend's wedding, and around that time he was invited for an audition in New York City, initially for Agent Skip Lipari, and later for the role of Baccalieri. He played Baccalieri for five seasons, and for the first two seasons, he wore a fat suit to fit the role. ==References== ==External links== * HBO Character Profile: Bobby Bacala Category:The Sopranos characters Category:Fictional capos Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional underbosses ","title":"Bobby Baccalieri"},{"id":"516484","text":"In the 1892 Quebec general election on March 8, 1892 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Félix-Gabriel Marchand. Mercier had been accused of corruption and removed from office as Premier by Quebec Lieutenant- governor Auguste-Réal Angers on December 16, 1891. The scandal probably influenced the outcome of the election. Mercier gave up the post of Liberal leader (and leader of the Opposition) to Félix-Gabriel Marchand, and was later acquitted of all charges. Boucher de Boucherville resigned a year later, and was replaced by Louis-Olivier Taillon as Conservative leader and premier. Taillon in turn resigned in 1896, and was replaced by Edmund James Flynn. Flynn lost the 1897 election, and the Conservatives never held power in Quebec again. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular Vote - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" align=\\"center\\"1890 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change Conservative  Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 23 !align=\\"right\\" 51 align=\\"right\\" +122% align=\\"right\\"91,579 align=\\"right\\" 52.41% align=\\"right\\" +7.02%  Félix-Gabriel Marchand align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"43 !align=\\"right\\"21 align=\\"right\\"-51.2% align=\\"right\\"76,280 align=\\"right\\" 43.65% align=\\"right\\"-0.86% colspan=2Independent Conservative align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"1 !align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\"- rowspan=2 align=\\"right\\"6,892 rowspan=2 align=\\"right\\" 3.94% rowspan=2 align=\\"right\\"-6.7% colspan=2Other align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"6 !align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"-100% - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"73 !align=\\"right\\"73 !align=\\"right\\"- !align=\\"right\\"174,751 !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"right\\" - } ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 8th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ","title":"1892 Quebec general election"},{"id":"516488","text":"William, Willie, Bill or Billy Bryant may refer to: ==Sport== * William Bryant (footballer, born 1874) (1874–?), played for Rotherham Town, Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers * William Bryant (footballer, born 1899) (1899–1986), England international who played for Millwall * Billy Bryant (1913–1975), footballer who played for Wrexham and Manchester United in the 1930s * Bill Bryant (American football) (born 1951), American football player * Bill Bryant (rugby league) (1940–2019), English rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s * Bill Bryant (cricketer) (1906–1995), Australian cricketer * Bill Bryant (golf executive) (1914–1983), American golf executive ==Other people== * William Bryant (convict) (1757–1791), convict on First Fleet to New South Wales * William Bryant (industrialist), cofounder of the Bryant & May company * William B.

Hyundai Construction played a major role in the importation of Korean laborers to the Middle East to work on construction projects in the 1970s and 1980s. In the decade following 1975, Hyundai signed their first contract in the region for construction of a shipyard for the Iranian Navy near Bandar-e Abbas. 800,000 Koreans went to work in Saudi Arabia and another 25,000 went to Iran; Hyundai was their largest employer. Under creditors' management with Korea Exchange Bank as the largest creditor, Hyundai Group was split into several entities from 2001 to 2006. As of March 2007, HDEC is the main shareholder of Hyundai Merchant Marine, which is the de facto holding company of Hyundai Group. Hyundai Group and Hyundai Motor Group (another spin-off from Hyundai Group) are both vying to purchase HDEC. In 2011, Hyundai Motor Group became the new owner of Hyundai Eng. & Const.,co.,Ltd.

He was one of the founders and leading members of the Whig party, and was a candidate for president in 1836 as part of the unsuccessful Whig strategy to defeat Martin Van Buren by running four candidates with local appeal in different regions of the country. He is, as of 2018, the only major-party presidential nominee to have been a North Carolinian at the time of his nomination.Which States Do Presidents Come From? (Not Minnesota, Yet) ==Early life and education== Mangum was born in Durham County, North Carolina (then part of Orange County), to a family of the planter class. He was the son of Catherine (Davis) and William Person Mangum.http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00003610/00001 In his youth, he attended the respected private school in Raleigh run by John Chavis, a free black. They remained friends for years and had a long correspondence. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1815. ==Career== 1844 portrait by James Lambdin Mangum began a law practice and entered politics. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1823 to 1826. After an interlude as a superior court judge, he was elected by the legislature as a Democrat to the Senate from North Carolina in 1830. Mangum's stay in the Democratic Party was short. He opposed President Andrew Jackson on most of the major issues of the day, including the protective tariff, nullification, and the Bank of the United States. In 1834, Mangum openly declared himself to be a \\"Whig\\", and two years later, he resigned his Senate seat. Due to a lack of organizational cohesion in the new Whig Party during the 1836 election, the Whigs put forward four presidential candidates: Daniel Webster in Massachusetts, William Henry Harrison in the remaining Northern and Border States, Hugh White in the middle and lower South, and Mangum in South Carolina. Some optimistic Whigs foresaw the nomination of several candidates resulting in denying a majority of electoral votes to any one candidate and throwing the election into the House of Representatives, much like what occurred in 1824, where Whig representatives could then coalesce around a single candidate. This possibility, however, did not come to fruition and Democratic candidate Martin Van Buren won the election with an outright majority of electoral votes. The legislature of South Carolina (which chose their electors until 1865) gave Mangum its 11 electoral votes. After a four- year absence, Mangum served two more terms in the Senate, where he was an important ally of Henry Clay. In 1842, he succeeded Samuel L. Southard as president pro tempore of the Senate, during a vice presidential vacancy. Upon assuming office on May 23, he also became next in succession to the presidency, and remained so until the swearing in of George M. Dallas on March 4, 1845, a period which included President John Tyler's narrow escape from death in the USS Princeton disaster of 1844. In 1852, he refused an offer to be a candidate for vice president on the Whig national ticket; fellow North Carolinian William Alexander Graham was nominated instead. Realizing that he had little chance of being re-elected as the Whig Party broke up following the 1852 elections, Mangum retired in 1853 at the end of his second term. In 1856 he, like many ex-Whigs, joined the nativist American Party, but a stroke soon afterward ended his political career. Mangum died at his family estate in Red Mountain, an unincorporated area of Durham County, on September 7, 1861. He was buried in the family cemetery on his estate. ==Marriage and family== Mangum married Charity Alston Cain in 1819. They had five children. Their only son died in July 1861 at the First Battle of Bull Run, a month before his father. His plantation was known as Walnut Hall. A 1931 biography of John Chavis noted that Mangum had allowed his former teacher to be buried on his land.Shaw, G. C.

The name 'Raijin' is derived from the Japanese words and . Raijin is typically depicted with fierce and aggressive facial expressions, standing atop a cloud, and is shown beating on drums. The drums are often shown to have the symbol tomoe drawn on them. Raijin is often depicted as a protector or warrior figure within Japanese temples and shrines. == Description == Fūjin- raijin-zu by Tawaraya Sōtatsu, with Raijin shown on the left and Fūjin right. Raijin is often depicted with a fierce, frightening face and a muscular figure with gravity-defying hair. He is surrounded by Taiko drums that he plays to create the sound of thunder. Raijin holds large hammers in his hands that he uses to play the drums. In some cases, Raijin is portrayed with three fingers which are said to represent the past, present and future. Two of the most notable sculptures of Raijin are located in the Sanjusangendo temple and the Taiyuin Rinnoji temple. Raijin and Fujin reside side by side in the Kaminarimon gate that guards the entrance to the Sanjusangendo temple. These sculptures are made of wood with lacquer, gold leaf and paint along with crystal, inlaid eyes. The Raijin and Fujin sculptures in Sanjusangendo are considered national treasures. In the Taiyuin Rinnoji temple, Raijin and Fujin are located in the Niten-mon gate. They are made of wood with paint and are seen with their token talismans, Raijin's drums and Fujin's wind bag. ==Mythology== In the myths recorded in the Kojiki, after Izanami died from the wounds inflicted on her by the birthing of Hinokagutsutchi, her husband Izanagi followed her down into Yomi no Kuni, the land of darkness. When he asked to come with him, Izanami responded that she cannot leave, because she had already eaten from the food there. As Izanagi followed her all the way to Yomi, to try to fulfill his wish that she go with him, Izanami returned to her palace to negotiate with the residing kami. Izanami was gone for several hours, which made Izanagi worried for her. Thus, after making fire on the tip of his comb, he entered the palace. There, Izanagi found Izanami's corpse. On her body maggots gathered, and on her head arose , on her chest , in her stomach , on her vagina , in her left hand , in her right hand , on her left leg and on her right leg ; collectively called . Upon seeing Izanami's twisted body, Izanagi fled from Yomi, shaken and in terror. In shame of allowing him to see her unsightly form, Izanami sent Raijin and several female demons to chase after Izanagi, after he fled the image of her rotting form, to bring him back to Yomi. Raijin has many siblings, most notably, Fujin (the god of wind), Kagutsuchi (the god of fire), Susanoo (the god of the sea and storms), and Amaterasu (the goddess of the sun). Raijin is also often seen in the company of his brother, Fujin, and his son, Raitaro. He is often seen fighting with Fujin, mending his drums, or causing mischief. He is also shown in the company of Raiju, a thunder-beast or thunder demon. Prayers to Raijin were mainly based upon agriculture as it was believed that rice that was struck by lightning would produce the best harvest. === Legends === In one legend, Raijin is shown to defend Japan against the invading Mongols. In this legend, the Mongols are driven off by a vicious storm in which Raijin is in the clouds throwing lightning and arrows at the invaders. Another legend depicts how a man named Sugaru (nicknamed the God-catcher) was ordered to catch the Thunder God Raijin and deliver him to the Emperor in order to stop a storm. Sugaru commands Raijin to cease the storm in the name of the Emperor but to no avail. Sugaru prayed to Kannon who later delivered Raijin to him. Sugaru then tied him up in a sack and took him to the Emperor. == Modern role == Some Japanese parents tell their children to hide their belly buttons during thunderstorms so that Raijin does not take them away and eat them. Raijin also appears in the kabuki play Narukami, in which he is imprisoned under a pool of water, thus causing a drought. == See also == * Fūjin (Japanese), god of wind * Izanagi (Japanese), one of the divine pair of creation deities * Izanami (Japanese), one of the divine pair of creation deities * Leigong (Chinese), god of thunder * Leizi (Chinese), goddess of lightning * Parjanya (Hindu), god of rain, thunder and lightning * Raiden (Mortal Kombat) * Sanjūsangen-dō (Japanese temple) ==References== ==External links== * Netsuke: masterpieces from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains many representations of Raijin Category:Japanese gods Category:Shinto kami Category:Thunder gods ","title":"Raijin"},{"id":"516504","text":"William Henry Haywood Jr. (October 23, 1801October 7, 1852) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1843 and 1846.

Raised as the eldest son of a poor Korean farmer, he became the richest man in South Korea. Chung was an integral part to the rapid development of Korea's economy, growing Hyundai Heavy Industries to be the largest ship builder in the world, as well as growing Hyundai Motor Group into the largest automobile manufacturer in Korea, and the third largest in the world. Chung was also a vital contributor to the development of South Korea's infrastructure after the Korean War's destruction on much domestic infrastructure by constructing the Gyeongbu Expressway in 1970, connecting the capital, Seoul, to the port city of Busan, in alliance with the President Park Chung Hee. Chung's business ventures steered through the tumultuous times of the Japanese occupation of South Korea as well as the post Korean War stresses on the economy. Chung explained his success in his statement: \\"Our people succeeded because they devoted their enterprising spirits. They used the forces of other mind. Conviction....creates indomitable efforts. This is the key to (true) miracles... Man's potential is limitless.\\" Made in Korea: Chung Ju Yung and the Rise of Hyundai. By Richard M. Steers. Pg. 1. 1998. == Life Early life=== Chung Ju-yung was born in Kangwon Province (North Korea) when Korea was under Japanese rule. Born to a large impoverished family of peasants, he was the eldest of seven children. As a young boy, Chung dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but his hopes were cut short because the restrictive environment at the time kept the family stuck in poverty, effectively keeping Chung away from higher educational opportunities. Despite the setbacks, Chung was able to attend a local Confucian school run by his grandfather whenever his time was not taken up by tasks on the family farm. Chung’s talent for business became apparent during his trips into town where he would sell wood. The fast-paced atmosphere of the town along with the articles in newspapers he read sparked his imagination and he soon grew tired of the poverty that he and his family had to endure. First escape attempt At the age of sixteen, Chung and a friend decided to travel to the city of Chongjin for work in hopes of escaping the harsh realities of farm life.Chung ju yung After a 15-mile trek through the most dangerous parts of the Paechun valley, the pair reached the town of Kowon where they took up jobs as construction workers. They worked long hours for low pay but Chung enjoyed the fact that he could earn money independently. Chung and his friend continued the work for two months until Chung's father learned of their whereabouts. Second escape attempt The journey that Chung and his friend had embarked on made him realize his passion for civil engineering and gave him a sense of accomplishment. Once he returned to his home village of Asan-ri in Tongchon county, he devised another escape plan: this time towards Seoul. With two companions, Chung left for Seoul in April 1933. The journey seemed destined for failure, especially since one of the boys was caught by a sibling early on. More misfortune came upon them when Chung and his friend were conned by a stranger who promised them jobs but instead took all of their money. The journey came to an end when Chung's father found the two staying at Chung's grandfather's house nearby. Third escape attempt Chung once again found himself in Asan, where he remained for a year helping his father work on the family farm. Once his duties to the family were complete, Chung decided it was time to make another attempt at getting out of poverty. He managed to get a train ticket for 70 won by selling one of his father's cows. Once he arrived in Seoul, Chung enrolled himself in a local bookkeeping school hoping to start a career as an accountant. Things went smoothly for two months when his father managed to find him and after a mild argument, took him back to Asan. ===Rice merchant=== In 1933, at the age of 18, Chung decided to make a fourth attempt to escape. He left during the night with a friend who was trying to escape a forced marriage. Once Chung reached Seoul, he jumped at any job he could find. He worked first as a laborer at Incheon Harbor, a construction worker at Boseong Professional School and as a handyman for a starch syrup factory. After working at the syrup factory for nearly a year, Chung managed to land a job as a deliveryman at the Bokheung Rice Store in Seoul. Chung's new job offered him room for advancement and as he became more successful at it, he decided to stay on full-time. He eventually won the praise of the rice store's core customers which impressed the owner so much that he allowed Chung to manage the store's accounting after only six months on the job. His experiences as the store accountant helped him to thoroughly develop his business sense. In 1937, the owner of the rice store became ill and decided it would be in his best interest to give the store to Chung. At 22 years of age, Chung became the store owner and changed the name of the store to Kyungil Rice Store. The store grew and made good profits until early 1939 when Japan, in its war efforts to secure rice supplies for the country and its military, imposed an oppressive rice-rationing system which forced Korean businesses out of trading rice. ===Creation of Hyundai=== A-do Service Garage Chung returned to his village once his business failed and remained there until 1940, when he decided to try again in Seoul. After considering the reality of restrictions imposed on Koreans in certain industries by the Japanese colonial government, Chung decided to enter the automobile repair business. Using a service garage he purchased from a friend, Chung started the A-do Service Garage on a 3,000 won loan. Within three years, the number of employees grew from 20 to 70 and Chung was able to earn a good income. In 1943, the Japanese Occupational Government forced the garage to merge with a steel plant as part of the war effort. Although his businesses were shut down due to suppression by the Japanese, Chung returned to Asan with 50,000 won in savings to try to make the best of the situation. Hyundai In 1946, after the liberation of Korea from Japanese control, Chung started Hyundai and Hyundai Civil Industries in anticipation of the post-war reconstruction and industrialization. Chung won major government contracts and became responsible for building much of South Korea's transportation infrastructure, including the Soyang Dam in 1967, the Gyeongbu Expressway in 1970, the world's largest shipyard in Ulsan, the Kori Nuclear Power Plant among others. Chung also won contracts from the American military to build facilities for their personnel as his younger brother could speak English and was on good terms with the U.S. Army engineers. During the North Korean invasion of 1950, Chung abandoned his construction projects and fled with his younger brother to Busan for safety. His son, Chung Mong-joon was born there. Chung continued to build onto the company by gathering any kind of work he could get from the U.N. forces and the Korean Ministry of Transportation. Once Seoul was retaken by U.N. forces, Chung reestablished the company and continued to gather more work from the Americans. From then on, Chung continued to grow and diversify the company into one of South Korea's major chaebol (conglomerate). With no experience in shipbuilding, he created the Ulsan shipyard, the largest shipyard in the world. The first vessel was completed in three years (rather than the expected five) as Chung had the shipyard and vessel built simultaneously. He introduced the Hyundai Pony in 1975 and the Hyundai Excel in 1986 using European expertise.Autopolis (2011). \\"1975-1982 Hyundai Pony: An Almost Cinderella Story\\".

Chung had a very successful career. In Seosan, he carried out a successful reclamation project, using a decommissioned oil tanker as a cofferdam.Amazon (2010). \\"Korean Founders of Automobile Manufacturers\\". In 1998, he herded 1,001 cows through the DMZ to North Korea, which he claimed was a repayment 1,000 times over for a cow he took to afford his ticket when he escaped his father's farm. He was the first to propose the Geumgangsan sightseeing excursions. He founded the Hyundai Heavy Steel Company which developed a non-dock ship-making method. Chung's philanthropy distinguished him from the other businessmen of his generation. In 1977, he founded the Asan Foundation with a scope of activities comparable to those of the Ford or Rockefeller Foundations. The Foundation was organized into four major areas of service: medical support, social welfare, research and development, and a scholarship fund. Through its efforts, the Foundation established nine hospitals throughout South Korea, built Ulsan Medical College, and funded the Asan Life Sciences Research Institute. The Foundation also initiated cooperative arrangements between industry and academic institutions by supporting such academic research as the Sinyoung Research Fund. In 1982, Chung received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. === Political activities === Chung is credited with successfully lobbying for South Korea to host the 1988 Summer Olympics. This success highlighted the accomplishments of his generation in the eyes of the world and became a source of great pride to the people of Seoul. In 1992 the International Olympic Committee awarded Chung an IOC Medallion for his contributions to sports as a vehicle of international understanding. Chung ran unsuccessfully as a presidential candidate for the 1992 South Korean presidential election. Chung also worked to normalize relations between the two Koreas. In 1998, at the age of 82, he worked with the South Korean government to provide economic assistance to the North. President Kim wanted to provide a $100 million donation as a way to jump-start economic development in North Korea. However, Kim could not find a legal way to transfer the funds. He turned to Chung, who was already negotiating a large program with the North. Kim persuaded Chung to increase his investment by $100 million with money from secret loans provided by the government-controlled Korea Development Bank. The historic South-North summit took place, with Chung traveling across the border in a motorcade of cars containing some 1001 \\"unification cows\\" as a gift to the North Korean people. ===Death=== Chung died at the age of 85 of natural causes at his home in Seoul, and he was buried in accordance to Buddhist and Confucian customary rites.故 정주영 명예회장 묘소 참배하는 이명박; 이제는 새 청사진을 그려야 할 때 His wife, Byun Joong-seok, died on August 17, 2008 at the age of 88, due in part to long-term heart complications,Hyundai’s Cornerstone Passes Away; '현대家의 대모' 변중석 여사 영원히 잠들다 and was buried in a family graveyard in Hanam, along with her husband and their son.2,000 Attend Funeral Services for Chung ==Legacy== As one of the most recognized and admired business men in Korean history, Chung's identity still pervades modern Korean society and industry. Business-related events emphasizing creativity and innovation have been named after him. Much of the current success of Hyundai is widely attributed to Chung's insight and resolution, ideals that the contemporary Hyundai leadership vouch to keep. == Books == * Trials May Not Fail (시련은 있어도 실패는 없다) * Born in This Land (이 땅에 태어나서) *Your Lips Need to Burn if You Plan to Succeed (입이 뜨거워야 성공할 수 있다) ==FamilyBrothers=== * Chung In-yung (1920 ~ 2006).

Usipetes or Usipii (in Plutarch's Greek, Ousipai,As accusative Ousipas, Plut. Caes. 22. and possibly the same as the Ouispoi of Claudius PtolemyGeography 2.10) were an ancient tribe who moved into the area on the right bank (the northern or eastern bank) of the lower Rhine in the 1st century BC, putting them in contact with Gaul and the Roman empire. They are known first from the surviving works of ancient authors such as Julius Caesar and Tacitus. They appear to have moved position several times before disappearing from the historical record. While the Usipetes and their neighbours were referred to by the Romans as Germanic rather than Gauls, their recorded names, including personal names, are most reasonably explained as Celtic: Usipetes has been translated as \\"good riders\\", and Caesar and others report them to have strong cavalry.-ipetes (*epetes) is a cognate of the Latin equites. Ludwig Rübekeil, Diachrone Studien zur Kontaktzone zwischen Kelten und Germanen, Wien, 2002, p. 81f. ==Tencteri and Usipetes in the time of Julius Caesar== In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Caesar describes how two tribes, the Tencteri and Usipetes, had been driven from their traditional lands by the Germanic Suebi, whose military dominance had led to constant warfare and neglect of agriculture. This original homeland of the two tribes is not clear but by the time of Caesar the Suebi had settled in a very large wooded area to the east of the Ubii, who at this time lived on the east bank of the Rhine, on the opposite bank from where Cologne is today. It has been argued that the Tencteri and Usipetes specifically may have come from the area of the Weser river to the east of the Sigambri, because it is near to where the two tribes appeared on the Rhine, and Caesar reports the Suevi in this area. It would also explain the apparently friendly relations of the Tencteri and Usipetes with the Sigambri, who might have been their traditional neighbours. (In later Roman times this area inhabited by Caesar's Suebi was inhabited by the Chatti.) In the winter 55 BC, having failed to find new lands elsewhere in Germania, they came to the Rhine, into the territory of the Menapii, a Belgic tribe who had land on both sides of the river, and had not yet submitted to Roman rule. Alarmed by the scale of the incursion, the Menapii had withdrawn from their territories east of the Rhine and successfully resisted the Germani bid to cross it for some time. The Germani feigned a retreat, allowing the Menapii to return to their territories east of the Rhine. Their cavalry then returned and made a surprise night attack. They crossed the river and seized Menapian boats, occupied Menapian villages and towns, and spent the rest of the winter living on Menapian provisions. Concerning the exact location of this slaughter, there has long been some doubt. Caesar describes a confluence of the Rhine and Maas rivers, but there is no such confluence. Archaeologist Nico Roymans has announced in 2015 that convincing evidence has been found that it was in fact in the confluence of Waal, a branch of the Rhine and not the Rhine itself, and the Maas/Meuse, near Kessel.http://www.nationalgeographic.nl/artikel/genocidaire-slachting-onder- leiding-van-julius-caesar-bij-kessel On the other hand, the 3rd century historian Cassius Dio described the place as being in the country of the Treveri near the Moselle, which had the same name as the Maas in Latin (Mosa) and does enter the Rhine in that region.Cassius Dio 39.47 English, Latin. This is however very far from the Menapii. Caesar, fearing how the Gauls on the left bank might react, hurried to deal with this threat to his command of the region. He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the Condrusi and Eburones, who were both under the protection of the Treveri to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Tencteri and Usipetes sent ambassadors to Caesar as he advanced. While they boasted of their military strength, claiming that they could defeat anyone but the Suebi, they offered an alliance, requesting that Caesar assign them land. Caesar refused any alliance so long as the Tencteri and Usipetes remained in Gaul. He proposed settling them in the territory of the Ubii, another Germanic tribe who had sought his help against the aggression of the Suebi, there being no land available in Gaul. (The Ubii were at this time on the east bank of the Rhine, but would later be settled on the left bank, where their capital became Cologne.) The ambassadors requested a truce of three days, during which time neither side would advance towards the other, and they took Caesar's counter-proposal to their leaders for consideration. But Caesar would not accept this, believing the Germani were buying time for the return of their cavalry, who had crossed the Meuse to plunder the Ambivariti a few days previously. As Caesar continued to advance, further ambassadors requested a three-day truce for them to negotiate with the Ubii about his settlement proposal, but Caesar refused for the same reason. He offered a single day, during which he would advance no more than four miles, and ordered his officers to act defensively and not to provoke battle. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, whereby horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar's cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 4.1-15Lee, K.H. \\"Caesar's Encounter with the Usipetes and the Tencteri.\\" Greece & Rome 2nd vol. 2 (1969): 100-103. They found refuge on the other side of the Rhine amongst the Sicambri (or Sugambri). Plutarch reports that back in Rome, > Cato pronounced the opinion that they ought to deliver up Caesar to the > Barbarians, thus purging away the violation of the truce in behalf of the > city, and turning the curse therefor on the guilty man. Of those who had > crossed the Rhine into Gaul four hundred thousand were cut to pieces, and > the few who succeeded in making their way back were received by the > Sugambri, a German nation. This action Caesar made a ground of complaint > against the Sugambri, and besides, he coveted the fame of being the first > man to cross the Rhine with an army.Plut. Caes. 22 ==Later mentions== The Usipetes, or \\"Usipi\\" as they were named by most authors after Caesar, continued to move around although all the details are not clear. In 16 BC, the Tencteri, Usipetes and Sicambri once again crossed the Rhine and attacked Gaul. Marcus Lollius was defeated and the Germanic tribes took the standard of the 5th legion. In 12 BC and 11 BC at the time of Drusus, the Usipi are described as living between Nijmegen and the Sugambri, and neighboring the Tubantes, which means they were in the region of the present day Dutch-German border, north of the Rhine and Lippe rivers. In 14 AD the Usipetes still lived near north of the Lippe and joined the Bructeri and Tubantes in fighting Germanicus. Strabo describes the Usipi as being among the defeated tribes displayed in the triumphal procession of Germanicus in 17 AD. Tacitus also describes in his Annales how in 58 AD the Ampsivarii demanded to be allowed to use the reserved lands on Roman border at the Rhine which had recently belonged to the Usipii, but it is not clearly explained where or why the Usipii had moved.Tac. Ann. 13.55 What is mentioned is that when the Ampsivarii retreated from the Romans, and apparently also away from the lands of the Bructeri and Tencteri (who had already stood down), they moved towards the lands of the Tubantes and Usipii.Tac. Ann. 13.56 So the Usipi seem to have settled for some time after Caesar on the north of the Rhine, but then later moved further north, away from the Roman frontier, to become neighbours of the Tubantes. Tacitus' Agricola (chapter 28), recounts how a cohort drafted into the Roman army mutinied whilst on campaign in northern Britain (presumably on the west coast) with his father-in-law, the general Gnaeus Julius Agricola (probably in AD 82, although the chronology is disputed). They killed the centurion and regular Roman soldiers based with them for training purposes, then stole three ships and sailed round the northern end of Britain, their hardships including being driven to cannibalism by shortage of food. They finally made landfall in the territory of the Suebi, where some were captured by that tribe. Others were caught by the Frisii and a few survivors were sold into slavery to tell their tale.Tacitus, Agricola 28 Tacitus in his Germania describes them as now living in 98 AD between the Chatti and the Rhine, near the Tencteri. This apparently indicates a significant movement south from the area near the Tubantes.Tac. Ger. 32 Later, the difficult to interpret description given in Claudius Ptolemy's Geography describes the \\"Ouispoi\\" (Uispi or Vispi) living south of the Tencteri, between the Rhine and the Abnoba mountains, but north of the Agri Decumates. If these are the Usipi, then they had moved considerably. (The same passage can also be interpreted as describing the Tencteri as having moved south.)Schütte, Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe, page 118 In the Peutinger map, the area across from Cologne and Bonn is shown as inhabited by the \\"Burcturi\\" (Bructeri), who may have included a mixture of several of the original Germanic tribes from over the Rhine, including the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Bructeri had apparently therefore also moved south. To their north were Franks and to their south on the Rhine were Suevi, both of whom represent new forces in the area. ==See also== *The Gallic Wars *List of Germanic peoples ==References== Category:Pre- Roman Iron Age Category:Military history of Roman Britain Category:Early Germanic peoples Category:Franks ","title":"Usipetes"},{"id":"516521","text":"George Edmund Badger (April 17, 1795May 11, 1866) was a Whig U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina. ==Early life== Badger was born on April 17, 1795 in New Bern, North Carolina. Following a partial college education at Yale College, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1814. ==Career== Badger practiced law in North Carolina, was active in state politics, and served as a state superior court judge. A supporter of Andrew Jackson from the 1820s, he separated with him in the mid-1830s, became a leader of the Whig party and helped carry the Whigs to victory in the 1840 Presidential election. Upon taking office, President William Henry Harrison appointed Badger as his Secretary of the Navy, and he continued in that post for a few months (until September 1841, when he resigned to resume private practice) when John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency upon Harrison's death (April 1841). Badger's brief term as Secretary was marked by efforts to strengthen the Navy in the face of tension with Great Britain, the establishment of the U.S. Home Squadron, and growing interest in steamships. Badger resigned in September 1841, during a general cabinet shakeup. The resignation of several cabinet members, including Badger, resulted from Tyler's vetoing of two bills to create a new national bank, which the Whig party, led by Henry Clay, supported. Badger was elected to the Senate in 1846 to fill the unexpired term of William Henry Haywood, Jr. and remained a Senator until 1855, after choosing not to run for re-election. He was nominated by President Millard Fillmore as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1853, but was not confirmed by the Senate (John Archibald Campbell got the position). He was a Unionist during the secession crisis but thereafter supported the Confederate war effort. ==Death and legacy== Badger died in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1866. Two Navy ships have been named in honor of Senator Badger: USS George E. Badger (DD-196), and USS Badger (FF-1071). A Liberty ship, the SS George E. Badger, also was named in his honor. Badger was a cousin of naval officers Oscar C. Badger, Charles J. Badger and Oscar C.

In May 2013, Altera made available SDK for OpenCL, enabling software programmers to access the high-performance capabilities of programmable logic devices. ===System on a chip FPGAs=== Beginning in December 2012, the company produced system on a chip FPGA devices using a fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) chip manufacturing process. These devices integrated FPGAs with full hard processor systems based around ARM architecture onto a single device. ===PowerSoC=== In May 2013, Altera acquired embedded power chipmaker Enpirion for approximately $140 million in cash, providing Altera with power system on a chip DC-DC converters that enabled greater power densities and lower noise performance compared with their discrete equivalent. Unlike converters made from discrete components, Enpirion DC-DC converters were simulated, characterized, validated and production qualified at delivery. ===Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)=== Altera offered a publicly available ASIC design flow based on HardCopy ASICs, which transitioned an FPGA design, once finalized, to a form which is not alterable. This design flow reduced design security risks as well as costs for higher volume production. Design engineers could prototype their designs in Stratix series FPGAs, and then migrate these designs to HardCopy ASICs when they were ready for volume production. The unique design flow made hardware/software co-design and co-verification possible. The flow was benchmarked to deliver systems to market 9 to 12 months faster, on average, than with standard-cell solutions. Design engineers were able to employ a single RTL, set of intellectual property (IP) cores, and Quartus II design software for both FPGA and ASIC implementations. Altera's HardCopy Design Center managed test insertion. In 2007, Altera’s Nios II FPGA soft processor core became available for standard cell ASIC designs. ===Semiconductor intellectual property cores=== Altera and its partners offered an array of semiconductor intellectual property cores that served as building blocks that design engineers can drop into their system designs to perform specific functions. IP cores eliminate some of the time-consuming tasks of creating every block in a design from scratch. In 2000, Altera acquired Designpro, a provider of IP cores. Altera offered soft processor cores on the Nios II embedded processor, the Freescale ColdFire v1 core (free for Cyclone III FPGA), and the ARM Cortex-M1 processor as well as a hard IP processor core on the ARM Cortex-A9 processor. ===Design software=== All of Altera's devices were supported by a common design environment, Quartus II design software. Quartus II software was available in a subscription-based edition and a free Web-based edition. It included tools to foster productivity. ==Technology40-nm technology=== In May 2008, Altera introduced the first 40-nm programmable logic devices: the Stratix IV FPGAs and HardCopy IV ASICs. Both devices were available with integrated transceiver options. In February 2009, the company introduced Stratix IV GT FPGAs, which had 11.3 Gbit/s transceivers for 40G/100G applications, and Arria II GX FPGAs, which had 3.75 Gbit/s transceivers for power- and cost-sensitive applications. Altera's devices were manufactured using techniques such as 193-nm immersion lithography and technologies such as extreme low-k dielectrics and strained silicon. ===28-nm technology=== In April 2010, Altera introduced the FPGA industry's second 28-nm device, the Stratix V FPGA (to Xilinx's Kintex-7 FPGA), available with transceivers at speeds up to 28 Gbit/s. This device family has more than 1 million logic elements, up to 53 Mb of embedded memory, up to 7 x72 DDR3 DIMMs at 800 MHz, 1.6 Gbit/s LVDS performance, and up to 3,680 variable-precision DSP blocks. In August 2011, Altera began shipping 28-nm Stratix V GT devices featuring 28-gigabits-per-second transceivers. Embedded HardCopy blocked harden standard or logic-intensive applications, increasing integration and delivering twice the density without a cost or power penalty. Altera developed a user-friendly method for partial reconfiguration, so core functionality can be changed easily and on the fly. There is a path to HardCopy V ASICs, when designs are ready for volume production. Altera’s 28 nm FPGAs aimed to reduce power requirements to 200 mW per channel. In 2004, the company began collaborating with Synopsys on HardCopy Structured ASICs. In December 2012, the company announced the shipment of its first 28 nm Cyclone V SoC devices, which had a dual-core ARM architecture Cortex-A9 processor system with FPGA logic on a single chip. These SoCs were targeted for wireless communications, industrial, video surveillance, automotive and medical equipment markets. With these SoCs devices, users were able to create custom field-programmable SoC variants for power, board space, performance and cost optimization. ===14-nm technology=== In February 2013, Altera announced an agreement with Intel to use Intel’s foundry services to produce its 14-nm node for the future manufacturing of its FPGAs, based on Intel’s 14 nm tri-gate transistor technology, in place of Altera’s ongoing agreement with TSMC. In October 2016, nearly one year after Intel's integration with Altera, STRATIX 10 was announced, which is based on Intel's 14 nm Tri-Gate process. ==Restatement of financial results== On June 21, 2006, after an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company restated its financial results from 1996 to 2005 to correct accounting errors related to options backdating. The chief financial officer of the company resigned. Altera filed a petition to overturn related regulations but was denied in 2020. ==Acquisition by Intel== In December 2015, Intel acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in cash. ==References== Category:1983 establishments in California Category:1980s initial public offerings Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Defunct semiconductor companies of the United States Category:Electronics companies disestablished in 2015 Category:Electronics companies established in 1983 Category:Intel acquisitions ","title":"Altera"},{"id":"516546","text":"Joseph Carter Abbott (July 15, 1825October 8, 1881) was a Union Army colonel during the American Civil War who was awarded the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers and a Republican United States Senator from the state of North Carolina between 1868 and 1871. During his career in private life he was a lawyer, newspaper editor and businessman. He also served as collector of the port of Wilmington, inspector of posts along the eastern line of the southern coast during the Rutherford B. Hayes Administration, and special agent of the United States Treasury Department. ==Early life== Abbott was born in Concord, New Hampshire, and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1846, having studied there and under private auspices. He studied law at Concord, and was admitted to the bar in 1852. From 1852 to 1857, Abbott was the owner and editor of the Daily American newspaper, in Manchester, New Hampshire. His success with it led to his being given the position of editor of the Boston Atlas and Bee, which he held from 1859 through 1861. He served as adjutant general for New Hampshire from 1855–61, reorganizing the state militia during that time. He was also a member of the commission to adjust the boundary between New Hampshire and Canada. He early joined the Know Nothing Party, and during all these years was a frequent contributor to the magazines, being particularly interested in historical matters. ==Civil War== In December 1861, Abbott became the lieutenant colonel of the 7th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry Regiment and participated in the battles of Port Royal Sound, St. John's Bluff, Fort Pulaski and Fort Wagner. In November 1863, he became colonel of the regiment and led it at the Battle of Olustee and during the subsequent Bermuda Hundred Campaign in Virginia. During the siege of Petersburg, he commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, X Corps at Chaffin's Farm and the subsequent actions along the Darbytown and New Market Roads. The Army of the James was then reorganized and his command became the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, XXIV Corps which was attached to the Fort Fisher Expeditionary Corps under Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry and participated in the second battle of Fort Fisher and the capture of Wilmington. Although Abbott was not appointed as a full, substantive rank general, on January 25, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Abbott for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from January 15, 1865 for gallant services in the capture of Fort FisherHunt and Brown, 1990, p. 2 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on February 14, 1865.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 748 During the final stages of the war, he was stationed in Wilmington, North Carolina. ==Postbellum== Following the war, Abbott remained in North Carolina. He was active in state politics, serving as a delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1868. During this time, his political strength came primarily through the black population. He believed in their capacity and assisted in organization and politically counseling them in ways which brought him blunt warnings from the white population. He was elected to the United States Senate that same year, representing North Carolina in that body for the first time since July 1861, when the state's two senators were expelled following the North Carolina's secession from the Union. He served as a Senator from July 14, 1868 to March 4, 1871. He also served as a member of the Republican National Committee from North Carolina from 1870 through 1872. During this period, he was also found to be in the pay of a \\"ring\\" whose major interests seemed substantially similar to Abbott's own political positions. During his tenure in the Senate, he spoke in orthodox terms on matters of suffrage, and was helpful in handling the details of army administration. He devoted a good deal of time to improve the harbor of Wilmington, and hoped that the railroads of the Carolinas would be consolidated and made part of a southern transcontinental system. However, for all his efforts, his single greatest achievement was the imposition of a duty on peanuts. He was not nominated for a second term to the Senate. Upon leaving the Senate, he conducted a lumber manufacturing business and served as editor of the Wilmington Post. He also received federal offices from both Presidents Rutherford Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant, including serving as collector of the port of Wilmington, inspector of posts along the eastern line of the southern coast during the Rutherford B. Hayes Administration, and special agent of the United States Treasury Department. From August, 1869, he served as editor of the Wilmington Post, a Republican organ of good quality for the era. However, he never again achieved any real status as a party leader. He established the town of Abbottsburg, North Carolina. He was originally buried in the National Cemetery in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was reinterred in 1887 at Valley Cemetery in Manchester, New Hampshire. Despite three marriages, he died childless. His political legacy is not much better.

He was the elder brother of General Robert Ransom and a cousin to fellow Confederate officer Wharton J. Green, who served as a U. S. Congressman after the Civil War. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1847, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. After serving as North Carolina Attorney General and as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, he was chosen as one of the three commissioners from North Carolina to the Confederate government at Montgomery, Alabama in 1861. ==American Civil War== Ransom was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 1st North Carolina Infantry Regiment and later Colonel of the 35th North Carolina Infantry. This regiment was part of his brother Robert's brigade, which Matt later commanded. Ransom was promoted to Brigadier General on June 13, 1863. Ransom saw action in the battles of Seven Pines, the Seven Days Battles, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Plymouth, Weldon, Suffolk and the siege of Petersburg. He was wounded three times during the Civil War and finally surrendered at Appomattox. ==Later life== After the war, Ransom moved to Weldon, North Carolina, in 1866 where he was a planter and lawyer. In 1872, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1871. Ransom was re-elected in 1876, 1883, and 1889 and served from January 30, 1872, to March 4, 1895. Ransom served briefly as President Pro tempore of the Senate during the 53rd Congress. He was later appointed United States Minister to Mexico and served from 1895 to 1897. Following his term as ambassador, Ransom retired to his estate, \\"Verona\\" and engaged in agricultural pursuits. He died near Garysburg, North Carolina, on his 78th birthday, October 8, 1904.

He represented North Carolina in the United States Senate for one term, serving between 1895 and 1901. At the time, he was a leader of the North Carolina Populist Party. He also affiliated with the Democratic Party and the Republican Party at different points in his career. He was the older brother of George Edwin Butler. Born in Sampson County, North Carolina, Butler took over his family's farm after graduating from the University of North Carolina. He became a leader of the Farmers' Alliance and won election to the North Carolina Senate as a member of the Democratic Party. During the 1892 election, he led a group of North Carolina Democrats opposed to Grover Cleveland into the Populist Party. As a leader of the Populists, Butler advocated \\"Fusion\\" with the Republican Party, and the Populists and Republicans together won control of the state legislature in the 1894 elections. The new legislature elected Butler to the United States Senate. In the Senate, Butler advocated for Populist reforms like the institution of bimetallism and the nationalization of railroads. In the 1896 presidential election, Butler helped orchestrate a compromise with the national Democratic Party whereby both parties nominated William Jennings Bryan. Butler stood for re-election in 1900, but Democrats had regained control of the state legislature and he was defeated. After his defeat, Butler practiced law in Washington, D.C. He died in 1938 in Takoma Park, Maryland, a nearby suburb. ==Early life== Butler was born in 1863 in rural Sampson County, North Carolina during the American Civil War. His parents were yeomen farmers. It is unknown if he attended any of the new public schools established after the war, but he was a graduate of the University of North Carolina. There he was a member of the Dialectic Society. His planned to practice law, but his father's death required Butler to take responsibility for managing the family farm, rather than attending law school. ==Farmers' Alliance and Populism== When the Farmers' Alliance movement spread from the Southwest into North Carolina in the late 1880s, Butler immediately joined the organization. It provided him a ladder of political opportunity that he climbed with impressive speed. As the son of yeoman farmers, Butler grew up in a strong agrarian tradition. Possessing the formal education and experiences from his years at the University of North Carolina, Butler stood out from his fellow farmers. By the age of 25, he was elected President of the local Farmers' Alliance and in 1893 was elected President of the National Farmer's Alliance. Still a Democrat at this time, Butler was elected to the North Carolina Senate as an \\"Alliance Democrat\\" in 1890. In 1891, at age 28, he was elected President of the State Farmers' Alliance. Due to a general distaste for Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland, and the North Carolina Democratic Party's ruling that no voter could vote on a \\"split ticket\\", Butler led a mass exodus of Alliance members and followers from the Democratic party which had ruled the state since Reconstruction, to the Populist, or \\"People's Party\\" in 1892.James L. Hunt, Marion Butler and American Populism (2003) During his tenure with the Populists, Butler was an advocate of \\"Fusion\\", meaning outright cooperation with the North Carolina Republican Party as a means to achieve some of the more important goals of his party. While some Populists disliked what they saw as a compromise made on some of their core beliefs, Butler saw short-term success. Together the Populists and Republicans polled a larger vote than the Democrats in the election of 1892; their Fusion candidates swept both houses of the legislature in the Election of 1894. ==Senate career== In 1894, Butler was elected as United States Senator from North Carolina, serving alongside Senator Jeter C. Pritchard. As a United States Senator, Butler continued to advocate for workable reforms from the Populist Party Platform, including the regulation or outright ownership by the United States Government of railroads and telegraphs, as well as for a silver- based currency system.Powell, supra. Butler obtained national prominence in the 1896 United States presidential election when he orchestrated a compromise between Democrats and Populists. Populists endorsed Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan on a ticket with Populist vice-presidential nominee Thomas E. Watson. This was another example of \\"fusion\\" under Butler. Ironically, this national Populist-Democrat cooperation coincided with the Populist-Republican cooperation in North Carolina. After Bryan's loss, Butler continued to work for reform on the national stage which would benefit farmers, but this work would soon be cut short by the \\"white supremacy\\" campaigns of the Democratic Party in North Carolina. Butler lost his bid for re-election in 1900, however he would remain the national chairman of the People's Party until 1904 when he would officially become a Republican. Butler joined the Progressive Republican Faction of the National Republican Party alongside notable individuals such as Theodore Roosevelt. ==Post–Senate career== Florence Faison During his time as Senator, Butler received his law degree from the University of North Carolina, and after his electoral defeat in 1904, practiced law in Washington, D.C. He had married Florence Faison of Sampson County on August 31, 1893, and they had five children: Pocahontas, Marion, Edward F., Florence F., and Wiley. The former Senator died in Takoma Park, Maryland in 1938, and was buried at Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in Clinton, North Carolina.Hunt, supra. A portrait of Marion Butler during his time in the U.S. Senate is included in the collection of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies in their chambers on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. ==Legacy== Butler's legacy is surrounded by considerable debate among scholars of the era. Progressive historians, who tend to look favorably on the goals of the Populist Movement in general have often discarded Butler's fusionism, silver- backed currency and emphasis on white supremacy as being \\"un-Populist\\".Hunt, supra pp. 2–4 In refuting this analysis, some historians point to Butler's immense popularity among Populist adherents, and to the fact that Butler held at different times the Presidency of the National Farmers' Alliance and was Chairman of the Populist Party itself.Hunt, supra pp. 6–7 Regardless of the classification of Butler's beliefs and actions, it is undisputed that his actions and rhetoric were extremely influential in the North Carolina and national Populist movement, especially after the death of Leonidas L. Polk, the movement's elder statesman, in 1892. The Marion Butler Birthplace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. ==References== #William S.

He served as chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance from March 4, 1913 to March 4, 1919. He was an unsuccessful contender for the 1920 Democratic Party nomination for president. Simmons was a staunch segregationist, white supremacist and a leading perpetrator of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898. ==Life and career== Simmons was born in Pollocksville, North Carolina, the son of Mary McLendel (Jerman) and Furnifold Greene Simmons.https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/simmons-furnifold After Republicans won control of North Carolina legislature in 1894, Simmons led efforts to disenfranchise black voters and return Democrats to power across the state. He allied with white supremacist newspapers to stoke fears of black men as predators of white women and too incompetent to be trusted as office holders or voters. Simmons also set up hundreds of \\"White Government Unions,\\" which aimed to \\"announce on all occasions that they would succeed if they had to shoot every negro in the city.\\" As a result, Democrats swept the 1898 election, and the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 broke out the following day. In 1901 Simmons won the Democratic nomination for the US Senate. From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts \\"to keep the machine oiled back home,\\" in the words of one journalist.News & Observer: \\"What the obituary didn't say\\" by Rob Christensen Simmons remained in office for the next thirty years. Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928 and the first Catholic nominated by a major party, winning him praise from members of the Ku Klux Klan. Still, rejecting the Democratic nominee in 1928, together with the Great Depression, led to Simmons being defeated in the 1930 Democratic primary by Josiah W. Bailey, who was backed by Governor O.

Fabian continues to serve as an independent consultant and public speaker on the NASA space program and environmental stewardship. ===Space flight experience=== Fabian first flew as a mission specialist on STS-7, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. This was the second flight for the Orbiter Challenger and for the first mission with a 5-person crew. During the mission, the crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and Indonesia (PALAPA B-1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the Orbiter with a free- flying satellite (SPAS-01); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2): and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven Getaway Specials, Mission duration was 147 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1983. Fabian was the first person to deploy and subsequently retrieve a free-flying satellite. In doing so, he used the Canadian-built robotic arm to release and later recapture the SPAS-01 satellite. On his second mission, Fabian flew on STS-51-G which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 17, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1985, after completing approximately 170 hours of space flight. This international crew deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United States (AT&T; Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. ==Associations== Fellow, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Fellow, American Astronautical Society; President, Association of Space Explorers - USA; Member, International Academy of Astronautics; Vice President, International Astronautical Federation; Served 4 terms as International Co-President of the Association of Space Explorers.

In disc dog competitions, dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching. The sport celebrates the bond between handler and dog, by allowing them to work together. The term \\"disc\\" is preferred because \\"Frisbee\\" is a trademark (held by Wham-O) for a brand of flying disc. A dog catching a disc in the air. ==History== The sport got its start in the early 1970s, paralleling the rise in popularity of Frisbee sport. The definitive moment came on August 5, 1974 when Alex Stein, a 19-year-old college student from Ohio, and his dog, Ashley Whippet, jumped the fence at a nationally broadcast baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. Stein had with him a couple of flying discs, which he threw for the dog. Ashley astonished the crowd with his disc-catching, as he ran up to and leaped in the air to snag the disc. The stunt was so novel that the game was stopped and Joe Garagiola continued to announce the flying disc action on the field. Finally, after eight minutes, Stein was escorted off the field and arrested. The nationally televised exhibition of Ashley's skill did much to fuel interest in the sport. Stein worked with Irv Lander and Eldon McIntire to create the Frisbee Dog World Championship for people and their dogs. Even today, Stein and McIntire continue to contribute to the sport. ==Format== Teams of one person and one dog compete in the standard distance \\"toss and fetch\\" event. Points are awarded to the team for catches at varying distances. Competitions also often feature the dynamic freestyle event, which consists of short routines choreographed to music with multiple discs in play. The less common long distance events have various formats, but generally the longest catch wins. Divisions in disc dog events are usually based on the skill and experience of the handler. Men and women generally compete in the same divisions for all disciplines, although the long distance category is sometimes divided by gender. ===Toss and fetch=== Short-distance events go by many names, including toss and fetch, mini-distance, throw and catch, and distance/accuracy. The concept is generally the same. Contestants have 60 seconds to make as many throws as possible on a field marked with increasingly longer distances. The distances generally don't exceed 50 meters for the longest catches. Dogs are awarded points for catches based on the distance of the throw, with mid-air catches rating extra points (in most contests an extra half point when the dog is completely airborne for the catch). Only one disc is used for these events. ===Freestyle=== Freestyle is a subjectively judged event, similar to freestyle events like skateboard and snowboard half-pipe, or freestyle footbag (hacky sack). The team consists of one person (handler) and his or her dog. Depending on the event, the length of a routine might be anywhere from one minute and 30 seconds all the way to two minutes. Teams are judged in categories that include canine athleticism, degree of difficulty, showmanship, and so forth. Incredible flips, hyperfast multiple catches, and spectacular vaults make freestyle a popular event with spectators, and it is regarded as the highest level of competitive accomplishment. ===Long distance=== The Quadruped was an NFL draft day competition held in April 1996 for the Jacksonville Jaguars. This competition format is older than all other disc dog competition formats other than the Ashley Whippet and the FDDO formats. Originally a halftime show for football games with four frisbee dog teams competing to be the last team standing. It turned into an open competition where many more than four teams were able to compete. Today we have the Quadruped Series, a group of competitions that are a points championship in the United States. The popularity has been so great within the frisbee dog world that it has spread to Europe where it has occurred in several countries. ==Competitions== Today there are several organizations running disc dog tournaments. Most competitions take place in the summer on flat, grassy fields. Winter disc dog contests on soft snow are also popular in places. ===Ashley Whippet Invitational=== The Canine Frisbee Disc World Championship (also called the World Finals Championship) was long considered the crowning culmination of the sport. ===Skyhoundz=== In 2000, Skyhoundz staged its very first World Canine Disc Championship, sponsored by Hyperflite. The Hyperflite Skyhoundz World Canine Disc Championship SeriesHyperflite Skyhoundz World Canine Disc Championship Series website is now the largest disc dog competition series in the world and features, each year, more than 100 competitions held in the U.S. and other countries, as well as U.S. Local Championships, State Championships, DiscDogathon Championship Qualifiers, a DiscDogathon World Championship, Xtreme Distance Championship Qualifiers, an Xtreme Distance World Championship, U.S. Regional Qualifiers, Open Qualifiers, International Qualifiers, a European Championship, and the World Championship. In 2011, the Hyperflite Skyhoundz Series will be expanded to include a week-long World Championship extravaganza that will include a World Canine Disc Championship in five Divisions (Open, Sport, Pairs Freestyle, MicroDog, and Youth) as well as an Xtreme Distance World Championship (and associated Last Chance Open Qualifier), and a DiscDogathon World Championship (and associated Last Chance Open Qualifier). Participants in the week-long Skyhoundz World Championship will have at least three opportunities at various Last Chance Open Qualifiers to qualify for the remaining invitations to compete for World Championship titles. Skyhoundz is the only canine disc organization to offer disc dog titling in conjunction with its competition series. Adrian Stoica and THINKERBELL: European Champion Skyhoundz 2014 (Microdog) ===UFO=== The UFO organization runs the UFO World Cup Series. The series is a \\"points series\\", similar to World Cup Skiing or NASCAR. The series culminates in World Cup Final. In 2006, UFO also ran the AWI World Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona. === The Quadruped === The oldest and most popular long-distance frisbee dog competition in the frisbee dog world. ===UpDog Challenge=== The UpDog Challenge is dedicated to expanding the awareness and participation of people and dogs in athletic endeavors. To wit: We want more people and more dogs having fun, playing together. So we designed some fun games built around the opportunity for every dog and human to work towards their own personal bests. You will have fun (Play), you will earn achievements (Achieve), and you and your dog will learn and grow. (Expand). UpDog is the most rapidly growing Disc Dog organization and series in the world. One interesting aspect of UpDog is the treatment of rollers as equals to through the air throws...allowing puppies and those with limited throwing skills to compete for points and to combat conditions like wind or rain. ===Other disc dog organizations=== The US Disc Dog Nationals (USDDN), which has clubs organizing events in the US, Japan, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Canada, Australia and Turkey holds a championship series known as the USDDN Finals and US Disc Dog International Finals. Other competitions are sponsored by the Quadruped, the Flying Disc Dog Open, and the Purina Incredible Dog Challenge. The United Kingdom has the recently formed UK Disc Dog Association (UKDDA), which will be holding seasonal competitions from March 2018 at The Dog Training Barn, Banbury, Oxfordshire, for the first time ever. ==Popularity== Part of the popularity of the sport is its accessibility. All that is necessary to enjoy it is a level playing area, a dog, and a flying disc. Also, a little imagination is an extra plus for Freestyle competition. It is estimated that over one million dogs play flying disc in the United States alone, though only a small percentage participate in organized competitions. Disc dogs are also popular attractions at sporting events as half-time entertainment. Going clear back to Ashley and his 8th inning performance in 1974, disc dogs have performed at countless football, basketball, baseball and soccer halftimes. They are many times found in amusement parks, county fairs and pet festivals of all kinds. There are a very small handful of trainers who even make a living doing these shows. ==Disc dog clubs== Disc dog clubs organize and promote the sport on a local level, and work with national organizations to run events. They offer newcomers a way to learn more about the sport, and are a great place for the experienced competitors to give back. Disc dog clubs are usually active in local animal charities, helping to raise money and awareness for such groups. Disc dog clubs can be found all over the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada and Australia. The first club was the Dallas Dog and Disc Club, founded in the mid-1980s by Ron Ellis. ==Disc dog training== Cockapoo midair catching disc with canine onlooker Not all dogs immediately understand the concept of the game. A dog may not instinctively know to turn and chase after a disc that is thrown over its head. To begin, the disc should be thrown straight to the dog at a short distance. Once a dog knows how to catch, it can learn the additional concept of running to catch the disc. The disc should be thrown at increasing heights, gradually throwing the disc higher, until it finally goes over the dog's head. At that point the dog instinctively follows the disc all the way around. ==See also== * Championship (dog) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Flying disc games ","title":"Disc dog"},{"id":"516575","text":"Daniel Charles Brandenstein (born January 17, 1943) is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of United Space Alliance. He is a former Naval Aviator, test pilot and NASA astronaut, who flew four Space Shuttle missions. He also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1987 to 1992. == Career Military === After graduating with a bachelor of science degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Wisconsin–River Falls, Brandenstein entered active duty with the U.S. Navy in September 1965 and was attached to the Naval Air Training Command for flight training. He was designated a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Beeville, Texas, in May 1967, and then proceeded to squadron VA-128 for A-6 fleet replacement training. From 1968 to 1970, while attached to VA-196 flying A-6 Intruders, he participated in two combat deployments on board the aircraft carriers and to Southeast Asia where he flew 192 combat missions. In subsequent assignments, he was attached to VX-5 for the conduct of operational tests of A-6 weapons systems and tactics; and to the Naval Air Test Center, where upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, he conducted tests of electronic warfare systems in various Navy aircraft. Brandenstein carried out a nine-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean on board USS Ranger while attached to VA-145, flying A-6 Intruders during the period March 1975 to September 1977. Before reporting to the Johnson Space Center in Houston as an astronaut candidate, he was attached to VA-128 as an A-6 flight instructor. ===NASA=== Selected by NASA in January 1978, Brandenstein became an astronaut in August 1979. He was ascent spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) and a member of the astronaut support crew for STS-1 (the first flight of the Space Shuttle). He was subsequently assigned to the STS-2 astronaut support crew and was the ascent CAPCOM for the first two Space Shuttle flights. A veteran of four space flights—STS-8 (August 30-September 3, 1983), STS-51-G (June 17–24, 1985), STS-32 (January 9–20, 1990), and STS-49 (May 7–16, 1992) -- Brandenstein has logged over 789 hours in space. Following his second space flight, he served as the Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations. Between April 1987 and September 1992 Brandenstein served as Chief of the Astronaut Office. He retired from NASA and the United States Navy in October 1992. Brandenstein was a pilot on STS-8, his first flight, which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight for the Orbiter Challenger and the first mission with a night launch and night landing. During the mission, crew members deployed the Indian National Satellite (INSAT-1B); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) with the Payload Flight Test Article (PFTA); operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) with live cell samples; conducted medical measurements to understand biophysiological effects on space flight and activated various Earth resources and space science experiments along with four \\"Getaway Special\\" canisters. STS-8 completed 98 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1983. On his second mission (June 17–24, 1985), Brandenstein commanded the crew of STS-51-G aboard the Orbiter Discovery. During this seven-day mission, crew members deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat) and the United States (AT&T; Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite, which performed 17 hours of X-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF) and six \\"Getaway Specials\\", they also participated in biomedical experiments and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. The mission was accomplished in 112 Earth orbits over approximately 170 hours. Brandenstein then commanded the crew of STS-32 (January 9–20, 1990). In the longest Shuttle mission to date, crew members aboard the Orbiter Columbia successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 9,724 kg (21,393 lb) Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also conducted a variety of mid-deck experiments, including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR) and the IMAX camera. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Following 173 orbits of the Earth in 261 hours, the mission ended with a night landing in California. Brandenstein also commanded the crew of STS-49 (May 7–16, 1992), on the maiden flight of the new Space Shuttle Endeavour. During this mission, the crew conducted the initial test flight of Endeavour, performed a record four EVAs (space walks) to retrieve, repair and re-deploy the International Telecommunications Satellite (INTELSAT) and to demonstrate and evaluate numerous EVA tasks to be used for the assembly of the Space Station 'Freedom'. Additionally, a variety of medical, scientific and operational tests were conducted throughout the mission. STS-49 logged 213 hours in space and 141 Earth orbits before landing at Edwards AFB, where the crew conducted the first test of the Endeavour's drag chute. ==Special honors and awards== He was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 17 Air Medals, the Navy Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster and Valor device, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, two NASA Outstanding Leadership Medals, four NASA Space Flight Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the French Legion of Honor, the Medal of King Abdul Aziz (Saudi Arabia), the Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross, the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. He is a Distinguished Alumnus at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls; an Honorary Doctor of Engineering at the Milwaukee School of Engineering; an Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Brandenstein is a recipient of the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award, the AIAA Haley Space Flight Award, the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal and the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award.

He was later democratically elected as Prime Minister of Fiji, serving from 1992 to 1999. He went on to serve as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, and later served as Chairman of the Cakaudrove Provincial Council from 2001 to 2008. He was elected to this position on 24 May 2001 and re-elected for another three-year term on 13 April 2005. On 24 June 2016, Rabuka was elected as leader of the Social Democratic Liberal Party, succeeding Leader of the Opposition Ro Teimumu Kepa, who publicly disapproved of Rabuka's nomination to replace her. On 26 November 2018, Rabuka was appointed as the leader of the Opposition to Parliament, following the 2018 election defeat. Rabuka was the only nomination for the position and his nomination was moved by Ro Teimumu Kepa and seconded by Biman Prasad. == Early life and military career == The son of Kolinio Epeli Vanuacicila Rabuka and Salote Lomaloma Rabuka, he comes from the village of Drekeniwai on Vanua Levu, one of Fiji's two major islands. He was educated at Queen Victoria School, where he became the head boy in his final year. He represented Fiji in shot put, hammer throw, discus and the decathlon at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games. Rabuka was trained initially in New Zealand army schools, from which he graduated in 1973, and later did postgraduate work at the Indian Defence Services Staff College in 1979, and at the Australian Joint Services Staff College in 1982. He was a senior operation plans manager for UNIFIL peacekeeping troops in Lebanon in 1980 and 1981. On his return home, he was appointed Army Chief of Staff. From 1982 to 1987, he was an operations and training officer for the Fijian army, except for a two- year absence (1983–1985) when he commanded the Fijian Battalion as part of the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping force in the Sinai. For his service in Lebanon, Rabuka was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1980 and the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1981.http://www.saxton.com.au/sitiveni-rabuka/\\"He was awarded the French Legion D’Honneur for bravery by the French Government for saving a French officer during an attack on the UN Headquarters in Lebanon in 1980.\\"http://www.saxton.com.au/sitiveni-rabuka/\\" For outstanding leadership in Lebanon, Rabuka was awarded the OBE (Military Division) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1981.\\" == The 1987 coups == Rabuka, by now a colonel, emerged suddenly from obscurity on 14 May 1987 when he staged the first of two military coups to reassert ethnic Fijian supremacy, following the 1987 election, which had brought an Indo-Fijian (ethnic Indian)-dominated government to power. Deposing the elected government, he handed power over to the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, a high chief whom he expected to implement ethnic Fijian interests. When, however, Ganilau attempted to reinstate the abrogated constitution, Rabuka carried out a second coup on 28 September that year. At first he pledged his allegiance to the Queen, but on 7 October he issued a decree (Declaration – Republic of Fiji Decree 1987 No. 8) proclaiming a republic, abolishing the 113-year link to the British Monarchy. He handed over power on 5 December to an interim administration, headed by Ganilau as President and Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara as Prime Minister, but remained Commander of the Army and Minister of Home Affairs, the National Youth Service, and the Auxiliary Army Service. Ganilau and Mara did not feel strong enough to dismiss Rabuka, but the public support they enjoyed as high chiefs was such that he did not feel strong enough to depose them. An uneasy truce existed between Ganilau and Mara on the one hand and Rabuka on the other. Rabuka was seen as a hero by the Indigenous members when he overthrew Fiji's first Indian government to install an indigenous Fijian ruling class.http://www.corbisimages.com/stock- photo/rights-managed/0000230154-020/sitiveni-rabuka-at-fijian-military- training-ceremony\\" In April 1987, Rabuka became a hero when he overthrew Fiji's first Indian dominated government in order to install an indigenous Fijian ruling class\\" During the time of the coup, Rabuka was sometimes referred to in the press as \\"Colonel Steve Rambo.\\" In 2006, Rabuka finally apologised for having executed the coups. Fiji Live reported on 28 March that Rabuka had told India's Ahmedabad Newsline, while visiting India for medical treatment, that he regretted his role in the coups, which he described as \\"democratically wrong.\\"Fiji's SVT party says office break-in was political, Radio New Zealand International, 28 March 2006 == Prime Minister of Fiji == Following the adoption in 1990 of a new Constitution that guaranteed ethnic Fijian domination of the political system, Rabuka was chosen to lead the newly formed Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei in 1991. This party won the parliamentary election of 1992 and Rabuka became Prime Minister. His government was weakened from the outset, however, by a leadership challenge by former Finance Minister Josefata Kamikamica. In 1994, Kamikamica left the party with five of his supporters, depriving Rabuka of a parliamentary majority. A parliamentary election to resolve the impasse was held three years early; the Fijian Political Party won a plurality but fell two seats short of an absolute majority in the 70-member House of Representatives. Rabuka formed a coalition with the small General Voters Party, a small party supported almost entirely by General electors, who comprised Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities. He also agreed to negotiate with moderate leaders of the Indo-Fijian community to draft a controversial new Constitution, which removed most of the provisions that had biased the political system in favour of indigenous Fijians. The elections of 1999 were the first in many years to see real competition between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians for power. Rabuka lost these elections, and was replaced by Mahendra Chaudhry, the first Indo- Fijian Prime Minister. == The 2000 coup and Queen Elizabeth Barracks mutiny == Following his electoral defeat, Rabuka was elected Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs of the Great Council of Chiefs. He was forced to relinquish this post in 2001, however, in the wake of allegations made against him by former President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara of complicity in the Fiji coup of 2000, which deposed both Mara and the Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, on 19 May 2000. Claiming that the coup leader George Speight – who was then in custody and has since been convicted of treason – was only a front, Mara appeared on Close-Up television program on 30 April 2001 and revealed that on 21 May 2000, two days after the coup, he had confronted Rabuka and Isikia Savua, the police chief, about their possible involvement in it. \\"I could see it in their faces,\\" Mara declared. Ratu Mara told the programme that within half an hour of Speight's forcible occupation of the Parliament, Rabuka had telephoned Government House (the official residence of the President) to offer to form a government. He further alleged that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit of the Army had been involved in the coup after receiving training on a farm owned by Rabuka. In an interview with Fiji's Daily Post on 2 July 2001, Rabuka angrily denied the allegations, saying that they were the ravings of '\\"an angry old man\\" and \\"very unbecoming of a national leader and of a statesman.\\" The charges, however, were repeated on the floor of the Senate on 23 October 2004 by Adi Koila Nailatikau, Mara's daughter. Former Attorney-General Sir Vijay Singh published a memoir in 2006, supporting the allegations against Rabuka. Fiji Village quoted Singh on 18 August 2006 as saying, at the launch of his memoir, \\"Speaking Out\\", that Rabuka had told him personally that he was one of the ring-leaders and that real target of the coup was not the Chaudhry government, but Ratu Mara, and that Mara had voiced his own suspicions about Rabuka to Singh. \\"On Monday (following the Friday coup) I had a telephone conversation with the President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. He had no doubts that it was Mr Sitiveni Rabuka and Mr Isikia Savua\\", the then Commissioner of Police \\"who had organised the miserable affair at parliamentary complex,\\" Singh said. Rabuka refused to comment on Singh's allegations, citing sub judice. === Alleged role in mutiny === Rabuka was also accused of instigating or supporting the mutiny that took place at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November 2000. In an interview with the Fiji Times on 12 November 2000, the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama charged that while the revolt was in progress, Rabuka had visited the barracks with his army uniform in the car, ready to take over command of the army. He also allegedly started issuing orders to soldiers. \\"Rabuka's words to one of my colonels at the height of the shootings raised my suspicions,\\" Bainimarama said. \\"He said the Colonel should listen to his instructions. He also criticised my leadership.\\" Bainimarama accused Rabuka of leading soldiers astray by using \\"confusing\\" and \\"deceiving\\" words. Bainimarama also accused Rabuka of having \\"politicized\\" the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) unit, which he had founded as a bodyguard in 1987, to favour both the mutiny and the earlier takeover of parliament in May. Members of the CRW were involved in both the May coup and the November mutiny. Bainimarama's version was supported by Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula, who led the counteroffensive to put down the mutiny. On 13 November 2000, he said that rebels interrogated by the military had implicated Rabuka. He accused Rabuka of trying to take civilians into the barracks to act as human shields for the mutineers, and stated that Rabuka's intention was to \\"claim military leadership and ultimately overthrow the Government of the day.\\" Rabuka, a retired officer, denied supporting the mutiny, but refused to comment on an accusation from Bainimarama that he had called a meeting of senior officers loyal to him to depose Bainimarama. === 2006 arrest === Rabuka's denials of the allegations against him did not end the controversy. On 14 May 2005, The New Zealand Heraldreported in its Weekend Herald edition that the Fiji police force was close to making a decision on whether to charge certain unnamed individuals, one of whom the Herald believed to be Rabuka. The report quoted Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes as saying that a major hindrance to their investigation was a \\"cone of silence\\" among the close associates of the suspects. Rabuka was arrested on 11 May 2006 on charges of inciting Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula to commit a military mutiny on 2 November 2000, in the aftermath of the 2000 coup. He was alleged to have approached Seruvakula back on 4 July that year, with a view to overthrowing the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama. He entered no plea, was released on $F 1000 bail, and was required to surrender his passport. He was ordered to report to the Namadi police station between 6 am and 6 pm every Monday and Saturday, and was warned not to try to influence any witnesses, according to a Fiji Live report. It was announced on 17 June that at the request of the Director of Prosecutions, the case had been transferred to the High Court due to the serious nature of the charge. Rabuka appeared in the High Court on 30 June and pleaded not guilty, Fiji Village reported. The trial was set for 20 October, but this was later changed to 6 November. Fiji Village reported on 6 September that Rabuka had been refused permission to travel to Papua New Guinea for a golf tournament. Judge Gerard Winter ruled that the charges against Rabuka were serious and that he must not be allowed to abscond. Permission to leave Fiji would therefore be granted for medical emergencies only; the golf tournament did not qualify, he declared. On 11 December 2006, Rabuka was found not guilty on two counts of inciting a mutiny. The judge cast a deciding vote after the panel of assessors was split. == Later controversies == In 2004, the Fijian government announced that Rabuka would be Fiji's next Ambassador to the United States Government in Washington D.C. Continuing suspicions about his involvement in the 2000 coup, however, thwarted the appointment, with the American State Department reportedly rejecting him as unsuitable. On 27 May 2005, the Fijian government finally appointed Jesoni Vitusagavulu, a businessman and former banker, to the post instead. === Views on non-Indigenous Fijians as Prime Minister === Rabuka is noted for his propensity to walk both sides of the street politically. On 15 September 2001, he called on Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase to include the Indo-Fijian-dominated Labour Party in the Cabinet, as per the constitution, saying that to exclude it threatened the future of the Indo-Fijian community. It would make them feel marginalised, he said, which could lead to an increase in emigration. In 2004 he called for Chaudhry to be reinstated as Prime Minister, despite his having lost the 2001 election that was held to restore democracy. On 17 March 2005, however, he declared that no Indo-Fijian should ever expect to lead Fiji, and called on Indo-Fijians to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi, who, despite her assimilation to Indian culture, declined to become Prime Minister of India. He later qualified this statement on 28 March, however; Fiji Live quoted him as telling India's Ahmedabad Newsline that Gandhi's decision was a good example for Indo-Fijians to follow, but that it should be voluntary, not legislated. === The Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill === Rabuka took a measured position in relation to the government's proposed Reconciliation and Unity Commission, which will be empowered to recommend amnesty for perpetrators of the 2000 coup and compensation for its victims. This is in contrast to the great majority of politicians, who have taken a hard stand either for it or against it. On 19 May 2005, Rabuka said that the objective of the commission should not merely be to grant amnesty and compensation but to uncover the truth about who was involved in the coup, directly or indirectly. \\"It should be able to get to all those who were behind the coup and not only us who were widely accused of taking part. It should be able to reveal those who planned it, financed it and executed it,\\" Rabuka said. The prospect of amnesty, he said, might encourage some individuals to come forward who might otherwise be unwilling to talk. Despite his own qualified support for the legislation, Rabuka criticised the Great Council of Chiefs for endorsing it. So many among them were on the side of the coup perpetrators in 2000, he said, that their decision to support the bill could not be seen to have been made objectively. Rabuka spoke out on 21 October to oppose proposals to establish a separate but parallel indigenous system of justice, saying that such a system would be unable to deal with more serious criminal offences. === Views on military unrest === On 12 January 2006, Rabuka called on the government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase to get tough with the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama. Commenting on recent Military threats to remove the government, Rabuka said that instead of fearing the power of the Army, the government should realise that the Commander was not indispensable and could be replaced. === Views on the chiefly system === Rabuka found himself embroiled in controversy in September 2006, when he called for the abolition of Fiji's chiefly system and for the nationalisation of land owned by indigenous Fijians. Fiji Television quoted him on 1 September as saying that the way to solve problems associated with land and resources. \\"The indigenous Fijians will argue that this will leave them with nothing but in the end, it's for the good of all. We'll all benefit in the end,\\" Fiji Live quoted him as saying. Senior Fijian chiefs strongly criticised Rabuka for his stance. Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Ovini Bokini was quoted by Fiji Village on 4 September as saying that if Rabuka, a commoner, did not believe in the traditional chiefly system, he should consider resigning his life- membership of the Great Council, which was granted to him. Bokini's predecessor, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, had voiced similar views the previous day, with Fiji Live quoting him as accusing Rabuka of hypocrisy. Rabuka had executed the 1987 coups in the name of upholding the chiefly system, Ganilau claimed. Another high chief, Ratu Epenisa Cakobau, told the Fiji Sun that as a commoner, Rabuka was privileged to be allowed membership of the Great Council of Chiefs, and had no right to attack the system. Rabuka also came under attack from the Methodist Church. General secretary Reverend Ame Tugaue said that it was the chiefs who had accepted and upheld Christianity in Fiji and thought it dangerous to tamper with the system. \\"It is a dangerous call,\\" he said. Nationalization of land would also disempower the people, the Fiji Sun quoted Tugaue as saying. \\"If all assets are given to the Government to control, how can we claim ownership of the land? In the future, there will not be any hope for us.\\" == 2006 parliamentary election == In early 2005, Rabuka ruled himself out of contesting the 2006 parliamentary election, but on 7 May said he was reconsidering, following appeals from Fijian businessmen and former politicians to be part of a move to unite all ethnically Fijian parties in a joint ticket to contest the next election. \\"I am genuinely interested because I have always been for Fijian unity,\\" he said. He has stressed that he believes that political unity among indigenous Fijians is essential to prevent the election of an Indo-Fijian dominated government in 2006. He admitted, however, that he was seen as \\"a stumbling block\\" by many, but added, \\"I want to change all that.\\" On 29 May, he said that political unity among the Fijian people should not be looked at half-heartedly as a possibility but wholeheartedly as a need. He accused Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who has also called for unity among ethnic Fijians, of hypocrisy, saying that in the 1990s there was only one mainstream Fijian party, but that others had split from it and founded numerous competing groups. Qarase and his Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) were implied to be among those responsible for the disunity. On 21 August, Rabuka said he was of the opinion that Prime Ministers defeated at the polls should not stand again. Former Prime Ministers remaining politically active led to instability, he said, pointing to recent political upheavals in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands as examples. \\"It is healthy for party leaders who become prime ministers after being defeated at general elections to take the responsibility for the defeat and bow out of active politics and just become an adviser or remain as a party supporter but not in the front seat running for another election.\\" On 19 October, Rabuka said that the current parliamentary team representing Cakaudrove enjoyed his full support. He said he would follow the will of the people, however, in deciding whether or not to contest the 2006 elections. Current members of Parliament from Cakaudrove include Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, the Paramount Chief of the Tovata Confederacy, Manasa Tugia, and Niko Nawaikula. Despite his role in the formation (30 July 2005) of the Grand Coalition for Fiji, an electoral pact of five political parties supported mostly by indigenous Fijians, to contest the 2006 elections, Rabuka expressed doubts about its workability on 27 December. Public feuding threatened to derail the project, he warned. The recent attack on the 1997 Constitution by Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party leader Iliesa Duvuloco had upset him, he said. At the same time, Rabuka said that another coup would be unlikely and that given the disunity among indigenous Fijians, attitudes towards a non-indigenous Prime Minister would not matter. The multi- party Cabinet provisions of the Constitution could not be implemented if either the SDL or the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) won the election, he said; if the two parties found the provision unworkable, they should have amended the Constitution and had had five years in which to do so. On 7 February 2006, Rabuka said that he was still considering whether to contest the forthcoming elections. He thought it \\"unwise\\", without elaborating, to contest seats in his native Cakaudrove, or those held by members of the Grand Coalition, and might contest only if an urban open constituency was available. He considered, however, that given his length of time out of politics, making a comeback would be difficult. He also called for all political parties to be, and be seen to be, representing all ethnic groups. Otherwise, the racial faultline in Fijian politics would not be overcome, he said. In the end, Rabuka decided not to contest the election, and his party fielded only one candidate. == Rabuka and the 2006 coup == The Fiji Times reported on 15 December 2006 that Rabuka stated that he saw no possibility that Laisenia Qarase, deposed as Prime Minister in a 2006 Fijian coup d'état on 5 December, would return to power. He denied supporting the coup, but said that Qarase, along with deposed President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, were weak leaders who had done nothing to forestall the coup by negotiating with the Military while there was still time. Qarase should have seen the coup coming, Rabuka said. Following the coup, he criticized Bainimarama's refusal to hold elections, saying it was because Bainimarama wanted to \\"[keep] away from the role of governing, people and groups he has pre-determined should not govern.\\" ==Manager of the Pacific Islanders rugby union team== In October 2008, it was reported that Rabuka would be the manager of the Pacific Islanders rugby union team during its tour of Europe.\\"Pacific Islanders looking for a revolution as they prepare to tour Europe\\", Daily Telegraph, 18 October 2008 ==2014 elections and return to politics== U.S Ambassador to Fiji Frankie Reed (r) with Sitiveni Rabuka (c). Rabuka mostly kept a low profile after the 2006 coup. In June 2013 however, he came out and said that he would consider running in the proposed 2014 national elections, if they went ahead.Sitiveni Rabuka ready to reenter politics  General  3 News He sought the leadership of the newly formed Social Democratic Liberal Party (SoDelPa), the successor party to former Prime Minister Qarase's Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), which the Military- backed interim government had dissolved, but was rebuffed after he said that he had no regrets about the 1987 coups. \\"I had to do what I had to do in 1987,\\" he told the Fiji Sun on 30 January 2014. A subsequent bid for the deputy leadership of the party also ran into stiff opposition. He also sought nomination as a parliamentary candidate, but on 24 August, SoDelPa announced that it had decided not to nominate him. Despite this, he is still a member and supporter of the party. ==Leader of the Opposition and 2018 election== In June 2016, Teimumu Kepa announced that she was standing down as leader of SODELPA. She was replaced by Sitiveni Rabuka. rbuka led the party into the 2018 elections. On 25 May 2018, Rabuka was charged by anti-corruption agency Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption in relation to the declaration of his assets and liabilities as required under the Political Parties Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures Act. He was tried during the election campaign and acquitted. An appeal by the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption, which could have resulted in Rabuka's disqualification two days from the poll, was dismissed, with FICAC ordered to pay costs. Shortly before the appeal was decided Rabuka was again called in by police on unspecified charges. Rabuka won 77,040 votes in the election, gaining a seat in parliament. In a post-election interview, he said that it was unfortunate that the leaders of the two main parties were coup-leaders and that there needed to be \\"a move away from coup profiled people\\". On 26 May 2020, Sodelpa had been suspended for the breach of the Political Parties Act for 60 days effective immediately. All appointees have been declared null and void, and now have 60 days to rectify all issues or face deregistration. Thus, Rabuka can not represent himself as the leader of Sodelpa after the registrar declared the party suspension. On 29 June 2020, Sodelpa suspension was lifted. ==Personal life== Rabuka identifies as a Christian.http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=102060 He married Suluweti Tuiloma at RFMF officers mess in Nabua on 10 April 1975. In 2000, he publicly admitted that he had been unfaithful to her, both before and after their marriage, and that he had fathered three children by two different women whilst engaged to Suluweti. ==External links== * \\"Truth, lies and elections\\", article by Sitiveni Rabuka in the Fiji Times, 3 October 2008 ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Fijian soldiers Category:Fijian military leaders Category:Prime Ministers of Fiji Category:Leaders of the Opposition (Fiji) Category:People educated at Queen Victoria School (Fiji) Category:Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei politicians Category:Anti-Indian sentiment Category:Fijian Christians Category:Foreign Ministers of Fiji Category:I-Taukei Fijian members of the House of Representatives (Fiji) Category:Politicians from Cakaudrove Province Category:Fijian male discus throwers Category:Fijian shot putters Category:Fijian hammer throwers Category:Fijian decathletes Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Fiji Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games Category:Fijian sportsperson- politicians Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ","title":"Sitiveni Rabuka"},{"id":"516587","text":"William Edgar Thornton (M.D.) (born April 14, 1929) is a former NASA astronaut. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from University of North Carolina and a doctorate in medicine, also from UNC. He flew on Challenger twice, the STS-8 and STS-51B missions. ==Early life and education== William Edgar Thornton was born on April 14, 1929. He attended primary and secondary schools in Faison, North Carolina. He received a bachelor of science degree in physics from the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 1952. In 1963, he received a doctorate in medicine from UNC. ==Experience== Following graduation from the University of North Carolina and having completed Air Force ROTC training, Thornton served as officer-in-charge of the Instrumentation Lab at the Flight Test Air Proving Ground. He later became a consultant to Air Proving Ground Command. As chief engineer of the electronics division of the Del Mar Engineering Labs at Los Angeles from 1956 to 1959, he also organized and directed its Avionics Division. He returned to the University of North Carolina Medical School in 1959, graduated in 1963, and completed internship training in 1964 at the Wilford Hall USAF Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. Thornton returned to active duty with the United States Air Force and was then assigned to the USAF Aerospace Medical Division, Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, where he completed the Primary Flight Surgeon's training in 1964. It was during his two-year tour of duty there that he became involved in space medicine research and subsequently applied and was selected for astronaut training. Dr. Thornton developed and designed the first mass measuring devices for space, which remain in use today. Thornton has logged over 2,500 hours pilot flying time in jet aircraft. ==NASA experience== Thornton was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967. He completed the required flight training at Reese Air Force Base, Texas. Thornton was physician crew member on the highly successful Skylab Medical Experiments Altitude Test (SMEAT)—a 56-day simulation of a Skylab mission enabling crewmen to collect medical experiments baseline data and evaluate equipment, operations, and procedures. Thornton was also the mission specialist on SMD III, a simulation of a Spacelab life sciences mission. Thornton was a member of the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, 3, and 4 missions, and principal investigator for Skylab experiments on mass measurement, anthropometric measurements, hemodynamics, and human fluid shifts and physical conditioning. He first documented the shift and loss of fluid changes in body posture size and shape, including increase in height and the rapid loss of muscle strength and mass in space flight. As a member of the Astronaut Office Operations Missions Development group, Thornton was responsible for developing crew procedures and techniques for deployable payloads, and for maintenance of crew conditions in flight. He developed advanced techniques for, and made studies in, kinesiology and kinesimetry related to space operations. During Space Shuttle operations he continued physiological investigations in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal and neurological areas. He developed the Shuttle treadmill for in-flight exercise and several other on-board devices. He was long an advocate for exercise as a countermeasure for conditions such as bone loss in space. His work concentrated on the space adaptation syndrome, with relevant investigations on STS-4, STS-5, STS-6, STS-7, and STS-8. Thornton holds more than 60 patents that range from military weapons systems through the first real-time EKG computer analysis. Space-related items include the first in-flight mass measurement devices, shock and vibration isolation systems, an improved waste collection system, an improved lower body negative pressure (LBNP) apparatus, and others. Thornton continued his work in space medicine while awaiting his next flight opportunity. He worked on problems relative to extending mission durations in the Space Shuttle, in the Space station, and in space exploration, and has designed the necessary exercise and other hardware to support such missions. He continued analysis and publication of results from studies of neurological adaptation, and the study of neuromuscular inhibition following flight, osteoporosis in space and on Earth, and post-flight orthostatic hypotension. He has completed designs for exercise and other countermeasure equipment for the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO), and for Space Station Freedom, including improved treadmills, rowing machines, isotonic exercise devices, and a bicycle. Much of this is currently scheduled for flight. ==Spaceflight experienceSTS-8=== STS-8 Challenger (August 30 to September 5, 1983). This was the third flight for the Challenger and the first mission with a night launch from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Thornton, participating as a scientist-astronaut, was one of five crew members. During the flight Thornton made almost continuous measurements and investigations of adaptation of the human body to weightlessness, especially of the nervous system and of the space adaptation syndrome. This was a continuation of his previous work in these areas. Much of the equipment used was designed and developed by Thornton. The mission was accomplished in 98 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.2 million miles in 145 hours, 8 minutes, 4 seconds. He became the oldest person to fly in space. ===STS-51B=== STS-51B/Spacelab-3 Challenger (April 29 to May 6, 1985). The Spacelab-3 science mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned for a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 7-day flight, Thornton was responsible for the first animal payload on a shuttle mission and other medical investigations. The mission was accomplished in 110 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.9 million miles (4.7 million km) in 169 hours and 39 minutes. At the conclusion of the STS-51B flight, Thornton had logged over 313 hours in space across his two missions. ==Post-NASA career== Thornton retired from NASA effective May 31, 1994. Thornton is currently a Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, and is an adjunct professor at the University of Houston–Clear Lake. He resides in Texas. ==Special honors== * Recipient of the Air Force Legion of Merit (1956) * NASA Exceptional Service Medal (1972) * NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal (1974) * American Astronautical Society's Melbourne W.

Thornton"},{"id":"516588","text":"A filter fluorometer is a type of fluorometer that may be employed in fluorescence spectroscopy. In the fluorometer, a light source emits light of an excitation wavelength that is relevant to the compound to be measured. Filter fluorometers produce specific excitation and emission wavelengths by using optical filters. The filter blocks other wavelengths but transmits wavelengths relevant to the compound. The light passes through the sample to be measured, and a certain wavelength is absorbed while a longer wavelength is emitted. The emitted light is measured by a detector. By changing the optical filter, different substances can be measured. == Applications == Filter fluorometers can be highly sensitive, so are well suited to precise scientific research. The optical filters are relatively inexpensive and are easy to change, so filter fluorometers are commonly used in experimental applications which repeatedly measure different compounds. ==Filters== There are two filters for the fluorometer: #The primary filter or excitation filter or incident light filter isolates the wavelength that will cause the compound to fluoresce (the incident light). #The secondary filter isolates the desired emitted light (fluorescent light). ===Choosing the correct filters=== The proper selection of filters requires familiarity with the emission spectrum and the excitation spectrum. The primary filter is selected to transmit only the wavelengths from the emission spectrum and excitation spectrum that overlap. ==References== Category:Spectrometers ","title":"Filter fluorometer"},{"id":"516592","text":" The Blackburn B-25 Roc was a British Second World War-era Fleet Air Arm fighter aircraft designed by Blackburn Aircraft Ltd. It took its name from the mythical bird of the tales of the Arabian Nights, the Roc. Derived from the Blackburn Skua and developed in parallel, the Roc had its armament in a turret. The Roc came to be viewed as inferior to existing aircraft such as the Skua and the type had only brief front-line service. ==Design and development== On 31 December 1935, the British Air Ministry issued specification O.30/35 for a carrier-based turret-armed fighter.Brew 2002, p. 26. Blackburn proposed a derivative of the Blackburn Skua dive bomber, of which two prototypes had been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm earlier that year, while Boulton Paul proposed the P.85, a redesigned version of its land-based P.82 turret fighter (for specification F.9/35, which would enter service as the \\"Defiant\\"), with either a Bristol Hercules radial or Rolls-Royce Merlin inline engine.Jackson 1968, p. 399.Buttler, Tony British Secret Projects: Fighters and Bombers p55 Although the \\"Sea Defiant\\" was expected to be faster, the Roc was chosen. Like the Skua, the B-25 Roc was a two-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, fitted with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage, while its wings folded for storage aboard aircraft carriers. It was powered by a Bristol Perseus radial engine driving a three- bladed propeller and used the same Boulton Paul power operated gun turret as the Defiant, with four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns. It retained the wing-mounted dive brakes of the Skua, with bomb racks under each wing for two bombs and eight practice bombs to be carried.Mason 1992, p. 271.Jackson 1968, pp. 411–412. On 28 April 1937, the Air Ministry placed an order for 136 Rocs. As Blackburn already had full order books for the Skua and the Botha torpedo bomber for the RAF, it was decided to sub-contract detailed design and production to Boulton Paul at Wolverhampton, which delayed deliveries of the Defiant.Jackson 1968, p. 412.Buttler, Tony British Secret Projects: Fighters and Bombers p. 54 The prototype Roc in May 1939 The first flight by a Roc was on 23 December 1938; handling was acceptable and better than that of the Skua but its performance was poor, with a maximum speed of only .Thetford 1978, p. 60.Lumsden and Heffernen Aeroplane Monthly March 1990, p. 149. It had already been realised by some that this performance was inadequate, with the Fifth Sea Lord (the Chief of Naval Air Services) Alexander Ramsay suggesting in October 1938 that the Roc be abandoned. However production was allowed to continue as cancellation would cause too much disruption for Boulton Paul, instead beginning plans to adapt the aircraft for target towing.Brew 2002, pp. 38–39. As well as its primary role as a carrier-based fighter, the Roc was also required to be capable of operating as a floatplane, with a conversion kit being designed for a set of floats from a Blackburn Shark to be fitted but the first such conversion proved unstable and in December 1939 it crashed when being tested at Helensburgh Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment where it had been moved at the start of the war. While the addition of an enlarged ventral fin solved the stability problems, the effect of the floats on the aircraft's performance was too great to be ignored, with maximum speed falling to only and plans to form a fighter squadron equipped with Roc floatplanes were abandoned.Brew 2002, pp. 50–51. ==Operational history== The Roc Seaplane prototype, L3059 Delivery of the Roc began to the Skua-equipped 800 and 803 Naval Air Squadrons late in 1939, with three or four Rocs supplementing the Skuas. When 803 Squadron moved to RAF Wick in northern Scotland to provide fighter cover for the Royal Naval base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, the Rocs proved ineffective, being described as a \\"constant hindrance\\" by the squadron commanding officer, who requested that they be replaced by more Skuas.Willis Aeroplane December 2007, p. 57. During the Allied campaign in Norway a small contingent of Rocs travelled with 800 and 801 Naval Air Squadrons on (803 had abandoned its Rocs to become an all-Skua squadron). They were used to carry out combat air patrols over the fleet and again were of little use, showing inadequate performance to intercept German aircraft.Willis Aeroplane December 2007, p. 58. Skuas and Rocs operated over the English Channel in the summer of 1940 in Operation Dynamo and Operation Ariel, the evacuations of Allied forces from Dunkirk and other French ports.Willis Aeroplane December 2007, pp. 58–59. Probably the Roc's sole confirmed victory occurred on 28 May 1940, when a patrolling 806 Naval Air Squadron Roc, flown by pilot Midshipman A. G. Day and two Blackburn Skuas, intercepted five Junkers Ju 88s which were attacking a convoy off Ostende in Belgium. Flying underneath the Junkers while the Skuas attacked from above, Day's Roc destroyed one Ju 88 before returning safely to RAF Detling.Thomas 2007, p. 17. Rocs and Skuas of 801 Naval Air Squadron, strafed and dive-bombed German E-boats in Boulogne harbour on 12 June, damaging several E-boats and on 20 June, Skuas and Rocs were used to bomb gun emplacements at Cap Gris Nez.Willis Aeroplane December 2007, p. 59. The Roc was relegated to air sea rescue and target-towing in various locations; No 2 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit at Gosport received 16 Rocs to replace Blackburn Sharks in June 1940.Mondey 1994, p. 37. Some Rocs were sent as far as Bermuda, until the last two examples were withdrawn from service in June 1943.Jackson 1968, pp. 415–416. The last four Rocs stationed at HMS Daedalus in Gosport survived until late 1944, all unairworthy, with their turrets still being used for anti-aircraft defence.Dell, John \\"Dinger\\". \\"Blackburn Roc: A short description and appreciation.\\" Dinger's Aviation pages.

This can be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the electron absorbs a photon and gains all its energy or by electrical excitation (EE), where the electron receives energy from another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to transfer electrons to a higher energy band such as a more energetic sublevel or energy level. When an excited electron falls back to a state of lower energy, it undergoes electron relaxation. This is accompanied by the emission of a photon (radiative relaxation) or by a transfer of energy to another particle. The energy released is equal to the difference in energy levels between the electron energy states. == References == Category:Electron ","title":"Electron excitation"},{"id":"516595","text":"View of the Coliseum's seating during an Islanders game The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, commonly known as the Nassau Coliseum (or Nassau County Coliseum) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Uniondale, New York, east of New York City. The Long Island venue is approximately east of the eastern limits of the New York City Borough of Queens, and is also located next to the Meadowbrook Parkway. Opened in 1972, the Coliseum occupies of Mitchel Field, a former Army airfield, later an Air Force base. The facility is located in the Town of Hempstead, within the Uniondale 11553 ZIP code. The Coliseum is used for sporting events, concerts, large exhibitions and shows as well as trade shows— at the main arena, 60,000 at the Expo Center. In 2015, the arena was temporarily closed for a major renovation which was completed in April 2017. The New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) played at the Coliseum from 1972 to 2015 before moving to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. After the move proved to be commercially unsuccessful, the team split its home schedule between Barclays and the renovated Coliseum from 2018 to 2020 with plans to play the entire home portion of their 2020–21 season at the Coliseum. The Coliseum was also the home of the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA), now known as the Brooklyn Nets, from 1972 to 1977. In 2017, the venue became the new home of the Brooklyn Nets' NBA G League team, the Long Island Nets. In June 2020, Nassau Coliseum was closed indefinitely as its owners sought new investors, putting the Islanders' plans to return to the arena full-time for the 2020–21 season in doubt. ==Sports== The Coliseum originally had a capacity of 13,000 to 15,000 depending on the event, and in the early 1980s the maximum capacity was increased to around 18,000. Before closing for renovations in 2015 the Coliseum seated 16,170 for hockey, up to 18,511 for concerts and 17,686 for boxing. Those renovations resulted in drastically reduced capacities: 13,917 for hockey and 16,500 for basketball. The Coliseum was home to the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association, and later the National Basketball Association, from 1972 to 1977. The first event at the Coliseum was a Nets game against the Pittsburgh Condors on February 11, 1972. The Nets won two ABA Championships in the Coliseum, with Hall of Famer Julius Erving headlining the team. In 1973–74 the Nets defeated the Utah Stars in five games to capture their first title. The Nets then captured the final American Basketball Association Championship in 1976, defeating the Denver Nuggets in six games. Following the 1976 season the Nets joined the National Basketball Association as part of the ABA–NBA merger. After their first season in the NBA, the Nets moved to New Jersey. The New Jersey Nets played four seasons at the Rutgers Athletic Center before completion of the Meadowlands Arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The Coliseum also hosted the New York Arrows and later the New York Express of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. The Arrows, which existed as a franchise from 1978 to 1984, won the first four MISL championships.Yannis, Alex. \\"Arrows Fold Their Franchise\\", The New York Times, July 25, 1984.

It also has hosted first- and second-round games of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1982, 1994, and 2001. The New York Sets of World Team Tennis played their first match at Nassau Coliseum on May 7, 1974, and won the WTT championships in 1976. The team changed its name to the New York Apples for the 1977 season, and played 12 of its 22 home matches at Madison Square Garden and the Felt Forum, repeating as champions. Prior to the 1978 season, the Apples announced that they would leave the Coliseum and play all their home matches in the Madison Square Garden complex. The New York Raiders, intended by the fledgling World Hockey Association to be their flagship franchise, was slated to play in the new Nassau Coliseum in 1972–73. However, the Nassau County government did not consider the WHA a fully professional league and wanted nothing to do with the Raiders.Kilgannon, Corey. \\"A Pro Hockey Team in the Early ’70s Was Golden in Name Only\\", The New York Times, October 26, 2012.

Flames forward Morris Stefaniw scored the first NHL goal in the building at 6:56 of the first period, while Ed Westfall scored the first goal for the Islanders, as the Flames won the game 3–2. The first Islanders' home win at the arena was on October 12, 1972, where they defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3–2. The Islanders' first playoff win at the arena came on April 20, 1975, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 4–2.

The arena had been considered obsolete for many years, and various Islanders owners tried to replace it. ===The Lighthouse Project=== Team and county officials announced in 2004 a plan called The Lighthouse Project to renovate the Coliseum. The project's centerpiece was a 60-story tower that would look like a lighthouse. Other plans included new housing, athletic facilities, a minor league baseball stadium, restaurants, and a hotel. The project would also add trees, water and other natural elements to the area. On August 14, 2007, Islanders owner Charles Wang and the Lighthouse Development Group partnered with Rexcorp to create a new plan. The 60-story \\"lighthouse\\" evolved into two 31-story buildings connected by a footbridge at the top. The project was transformed from a simple renovation of the Coliseum property into a transformation of surrounding properties. Plans called for more 2,000 residential units (20% affordable housing), a hotel, a convention center, a sports technology center, of retail space, and a sports complex next to the renovated Coliseum. The overall project was slated to cost roughly $3.75 billion. Construction was not planned to begin until at least mid-2009. Nassau County approved the Lighthouse Project in 2006 on a 16–2 vote, and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was completed after a state-mandated environmental review. The Lighthouse Project was then expected to go before the Town of Hempstead for approval on a change in land zoning. However, the approval was never granted. After the October 2009 deadline passed, the Long Island Press reported the Lighthouse Project's cancellation. Wang has denied the report. In May 2010, Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had discussions with Wang about constructing an arena for the Islanders near Citi Field. Wilpon has also discussed buying the Islanders. In June 2010, the FanHouse website reported Jeff and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the Mets, began working with real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (who also worked on Madison Square Garden's latest renovation) on a feasibility study of a new Islanders arena in Queens. However, a source from Newsday indicated the FanHouse report was not true. There were also reports businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders and move them to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. ===2011 proposal to replace arena=== On July 12, 2010, Town Supervisor Kate Murray (R-Hempstead) announced an \\"alternate zone\\" for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum property that downsized the Lighthouse Project to half its proposed size and made the project, according to Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and the developers, \\"economically unviable for both the developer and owner of the site.\\" As a result, Wang, Mangano and the developers decided they would no longer pursue the project. On May 11, 2011, the Islanders and Nassau County executives announced that county residents would vote on a referendum for approval of a $400 million public bond issue for a new plan to replace the Coliseum. The plan, including the construction of a new $350 million arena as well as a $50 million minor league baseball ballpark nearby, was presented by Wang as a last-ditch effort to keep the Islanders on Long Island. However, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal by a 57% to 43% margin on August 1, 2011. On October 24, 2012, the Islanders announced the team would move to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn after their lease expired at the end of the 2014–2015 season. The Islanders played their final game at the Coliseum on April 25, 2015, beating the Washington Capitals 3–1 in game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the Washington Capitals forcing a Game 7, held in and won by Washington, ending the Isles' run at the Coliseum; in Game 6 Cal Clutterbuck of the Islanders scored the final NHL goal in the building, an empty netter at 19:07 of the third period. ===Renovation=== Not long after the Islanders announced their move to Brooklyn, Forest City Enterprises, the owner of Barclays Center, was chosen to perform a study on development possibilities for the Nassau Coliseum site. A request for proposal was issued as a result of this study to transform the arena into a smaller sized venue and its surrounding parking lot into an entertainment hub with theaters, sports bars, and retail. Four competing proposals were submitted in May 2013, and Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano selected two finalists in July 2013, including one from a group led by Forest City Ratner. Ratner's proposal called for a reduction of the Coliseum's capacity to 13,000 seats and a revamp of the arena's interior and concrete facade designed by SHoP Architects, the firm which designed the Barclays Center, which would cost the group approximately $89 million. As part of his bid, the Islanders would play 6 games per season in the arena, the Brooklyn Nets would play one exhibition game, and a minor league hockey team would call the arena home. On August 15, 2013, Nassau County announced Forest City had won the bid for the renovation of the Nassau Coliseum and the surrounding property, pending approval from the Nassau legislature and zoning changes from the Hempstead town government. The Nassau County legislature unanimously approved the bid on September 24, 2013. Billy Joel performed the arena's final pre-renovation concert on August 4, 2015. On April 5, 2017, a Billy Joel concert was the arena's first post-renovation event. Other acts that performed during the new Coliseum's opening week include Stevie Nicks, The Pretenders, Idina Menzel, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey, and Marc Anthony. On November 4, 2016, Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment reached a naming rights deal with New York Community Bank. The cost of the naming rights and the agreement's length were not disclosed. The deal with the county mandates the inclusion of \\"Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\\" in the arena's name; it was branded as NYCB Live: Home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performed their final show at Nassau Coliseum on May 21, 2017. This was their only show at Nassau Coliseum post-renovation. The Islanders played a preseason game against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 17, 2017, their first appearance at the renovated Coliseum. ===Belmont Park arena and Islanders temporary return=== In late January 2017, Bloomberg News reported via internal sources that Barclays Center was considering dropping the Islanders due to poor attendance and their effects on the venue's profits. The venue has received a poor reception as a hockey arena due to poor sight lines and ice conditions, as Barclays was primarily designed as a basketball arena. Newsday reported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with Ledecky, and he told the paper the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum. These reports were further elaborated by Long Island Association president Kevin Law in April 2017, who stated that Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment (who manages both venues) was preparing to offer a relocation plan to the team. Law felt that the alternate option of seeking a new arena in Belmont Park was redundant to the renovated Coliseum. The Islanders played a preseason game at the renovated Coliseum on September 17, 2017. The renovation project reduced the capacity of the arena to 13,900, a level which was believed to be unsustainable for an NHL team; in comparison, the Islanders' average attendance at Barclays is 12,059, the lowest in the NHL (Barclays Center is the second-smallest arena in the NHL based on seating capacity at 15,795, which is around 400 seats fewer than the Coliseum pre-renovation). As such, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman felt that returning wasn't a \\"viable option\\" for the Islanders, but noted that the team was \\"in the process of evaluating what makes the most sense for the franchise and particularly for their fans.\\" In December 2017, New York Arena Partners (a venture of the Islanders, Oak View Group, and Sterling Equities) won a bid to construct a new, 18,000-seat arena and mixed-used district at Belmont Park, beating a competing proposal by New York City FC for a new soccer stadium. The new arena is projected to be completed in time for the 2021–22 season. In January 2018, Islanders owner Jon Ledecky revealed on WFAN's Boomer and Gio that he had toured the renovated Coliseum with Bettman and other senior NHL officials. They assessed that the Islanders could play a limited schedule of home games at the Coliseum, but that it wouldn't be sustainable as a full-time venue because of its capacity and diminished amenities (such as few corporate suites) over other newly built arenas. On January 23, 2018, it was reported that Barclays Center was pushing for a short-term lease under which the Islanders would split their home games between Barclays Center and the Nassau Coliseum until the Belmont Park arena is completed, with the number of games at the Coliseum steadily increasing for each year of the arrangement. On June 21, 2018, it was announced that the Islanders would play a portion of their home schedule at the Coliseum until the completion of the new arena, with 12 games moved in the 2018–19 season. The number of games during the 2018–19 season at the Coliseum was later increased to 20. The Islanders used the Coliseum as their home rink during the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs but moved back to the Barclays Center for the rest of the 2019 playoffs. In September 2019, it was announced that in the 2019–20 season, the Islanders would play 28 of their 41 home games at the Coliseum. On February 29, 2020, state governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders would play any home playoff games of the 2020 playoffs and all 2020–21 season home games at the Coliseum. But in mid-March, the COVID-19 pandemic terminated the 2019–20 season. As a result, all playoff games were played in Edmonton or Toronto. ===Closure=== In June 2020, Mikhail Prokhorov, whose company runs the Nassau Coliseum, announced that the arena would be closed indefinitely while it seeks new investors to take it over and assume the remaining debt. NYCB pulled out of its naming rights contract in late-August 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1972 establishments in New York (state) Category:American Basketball Association venues Category:Arena football venues Category:Basketball venues in New York (state) Category:Boxing venues in New York (state) Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:Convention centers in New York (state) Category:Former National Basketball Association venues Category:1998 Goodwill Games venues Category:Hempstead, New York Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in New York (state) Category:Indoor lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Indoor soccer venues in New York (state) Category:Legends Football League venues Category:Long Island Jawz Category:Long Island Nets Category:Mixed martial arts venues in New York (state) Category:NBA G League venues Category:New York Arrows Category:New York Islanders arenas Category:Professional wrestling venues in New York (state) Category:Sports venues in Hempstead, New York Category:Sports venues in Long Island Category:Sports venues in Nassau County, New York Category:Sports venues completed in 1972 Category:Tennis venues in New York (state) Category:Welton Becket buildings Category:Wrestling venues in New York (state) Category:New York Riptide ","title":"Nassau Coliseum"},{"id":"516597","text":"Frank Graham may refer to: *Frank D.

After graduating from Trinity College (now the undergraduate liberal arts college of Duke University) in 1910 and Duke University Law School in 1912, he became a practicing attorney—but interrupted his work to serve in the United States Army during World War I. In 1912, he founded the law firm that eventually became known as Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan (informally \\"Smith Anderson\\"). ==Political career== Smith served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1928 to 1932, and was briefly the speaker of that body in 1931. He also served as a U.S. observer at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946, as chairman of the American delegation to the Inter- Parliamentary Union in Bern, Switzerland in 1952, as chairman of the Duke University board of trustees (1947 - 1953), and as president of the American Bar Association (1945-1946). In the Democratic primary of 1950, Smith defeated incumbent Sen. Frank Porter Graham for the nomination. Graham had been appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of J. Melville Broughton and had served only a little over a year at the time of his defeat. In a campaign distinguished by race-baiting, Graham, who was well known for his antiracist sympathies, was supported by President Harry Truman and the state's liberal Democratic faction, while Smith was aided by a young strategist named Jesse Helms.

Lennon was one of the very few former United States Senators in modern times (the only other examples being James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. from New York, Claude Pepper from Florida, Hugh Mitchell from Washington, and Garrett Withers from Kentucky) to be elected to the House after their Senate careers. (Matthew M. Neely from West Virginia was also elected to the House after his Senate career, but he had been elected to the House before his Senate career as well.) Lennon was born in Wilmington, New Hanover County, N.C., August 17, 1906. He was the son of Rosser Yates Lennon and Minnie (High) Lennon. He attended the public schools, and graduated from Wake Forest College in 1929. He was admitted to the bar in 1929 and began practice in Wilmington. He married Karine Welch on October 12, 1933. Lennon served as the judge of New Hanover County Recorder's Court from 1934–1942. He was elected to the North Carolina State Senate in 1947, and served until 1951. Lennon was appointed on July 10, 1953, as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Willis Smith and served from July 10, 1953, to November 28, 1954. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the nomination in 1954 to fill the vacancy. He resumed law practice, then was elected as a Democrat to the 85th Congress, and was reelected to the seven succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1957 – January 3, 1973). Lennon voted in Congress against civil rights and social legislation, although about half of the constituents in his district were African-Americans or Native Americans. In 1966, he was the only Southerner to vote against citing seven Ku Klux Klan leaders for contempt of Congress. He said, \\"I never heard it said that Klansmen were subversive or affiliated with any foreign government to overthrow the United States.\\" In 1966, Mr. Lennon urged that North Vietnamese ports be bombed, and in 1967 he called for the Justice Department to prosecute Stokely Carmichael, the black activist, for making statements against the military draft. He declined to seek reelection in 1972. In 1976, the Federal Building and Courthouse at Wilmington was named in his honor. Although he was a Democrat, Mr. Lennon campaigned for the re-election of Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican, in 1978. He was a resident of Wilmington, N.C., until his death there December 28, 1986. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1986 deaths Category:United States senators from North Carolina Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:Wake Forest University alumni Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Alton Lennon"},{"id":"516611","text":"Flick may refer to: ==Arts== * Film (also flick), a series of still images that, when shown on a screen, create the illusion of moving images * Flick (2000 film), Irish film * Flick (2008 film), a campy British horror film written and directed by David Howard ===Characters=== * Felicity Scully (\\"Flick\\"), a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours * Flick, a character from the 1983 Christmas film A Christmas Story * Flick Duck, a character from the American animated children's television series PB&J; Otter * Herr Otto Flick, a fictional character in the BBC sitcom Allo 'Allo! * Tracy Flick, a fictional character who is the subject of the 1998 novel Election by Tom Perrotta ==PeopleSurname=== * Bertolt Flick (born 1964), German businessman * Flick family, a German family with an industrial empire ** Friedrich Flick (1883–1972), German industrialist and convicted Nazi war criminal *** Flick Trial, the fifth of twelve Nazi war crimes trials held by United States authorities in their occupation zone in Germany ** Otto-Ernst Flick (1916–1974), oldest of three sons born to Marie and Friedrich Flick in 1916 in Germany ** Friedrich Karl Flick (1927–2006), German-Austrian industrialist and billionaire ** Gert-Rudolf Flick (born 1943), German art historian and collector ** Friedrich Christian Flick (born 1944), German-Swiss art collector ** Donatella Flick, Italian philanthropist * Hans-Dieter Flick (born 1963), German football manager and former player * James Patton Flick (1845–1929), two-term Republican U.S. Representative * Lawrence Flick (1856–1938), American physician ===Given name=== * Flick Colby (1946–2011), American dancer and choreographer ==Other== * DVD Flick, an open source DVD authoring application for Windows * Flick (fencing), a technique used in modern fencing * Flick (physics), a unit of spectral radiance * Flick (time), a unit of time equivalent to exactly of a second ==See also== * Flicka, a 2006 British-American family adventure drama film * Flik (disambiguation) * Flicker (disambiguation) * ","title":"Flick"},{"id":"516615","text":"Pavle Ivić (, ; 1 December 1924 – 19 September 1999) was a Serbian South Slavic dialectologist and phonologist. ==Biography== Both his field work and his synthesizing studies were extensive and authoritative.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States senator from North Carolina from 1958 to 1973. ==Early life and education== The eldest of six children, B. Everett Jordan was born in Ramseur, North Carolina, to Rev. Henry Harrison and Annie Elizabeth (née Sellars) Jordan. His father was a Methodist minister who also worked as a circuit rider. After receiving his early education at public schools, he attended Rutherford College Preparatory School from 1912 to 1913. In 1914, Jordan enrolled at Trinity College (now Duke University) in Durham. He dropped out the following year and moved to Wellington, Kansas, where he went to work at his uncle's jewelry store. Towards the end of World War I, he served overseas with the Tank Corps of the United States Army (1918-1919). He was later assigned to the occupation forces in Germany. ==Business career== Following his military service, Jordan returned to North Carolina and became a floor sweeper at Myrtle Textile Mill in Gastonia. He became the plant superintendent of the Gastonia Textile Company in 1923. Four years later, in 1927, he and his family purchased an abandoned textile mill in Saxapahaw, renaming it Sellars Manufacturing Company. He served as the company's secretary-treasurer and general manager, later turning over management to his sons in order to focus on his political career. He also helped revive the Saxapahaw community, employing local residents and building a community center. In addition to working with his family's business, Jordan served as general manager, treasurer, and director of the Jordan Spinning Company near Franklinville, and held the same positions with the Royal Cotton Mill Company in Wake Forest. He was also secretary-treasurer of the National Processing Company in Burlington, and director of the Cotton Textile Institute and of the North Carolina Cotton Manufacturers Association. A devout Methodist like his father, he was an adult Bible instructor (1927-1958), chairman of the Methodist Board of Stewards (1930-1950), and vice-president of the Board of Methodist Colleges (1952-1956). ==Political career== Jordan became active in Democratic politics in the 1930s, working as a fundraiser for the North Carolina Democratic Party. The husband of his first cousin, W. Kerr Scott, was elected Governor of North Carolina in 1948. From 1949 to 1954, he served as chairman of the Democratic State Executive Committee. He was a Democratic National Committeeman from 1954 to 1958. He also served as a member of the North Carolina Peace Officers Benefit and Retirement Commission (1943-1958) and of the North Carolina Medical Care Commission (1945-1951), and chairman of the board of trustees of Alamance County General Hospital. ===U.S. Senate=== Governor Scott had been elected a United States senator in 1954, but died four years later. On April 19, 1958, Jordan was appointed to the Senate by Governor Luther H. Hodges to fill the vacancy caused by Scott's death. On November 4 of that year, he was elected to complete the final two years of Scott's term, defeating Republican Richard C. Clarke, Jr. by a margin of 70%-30%. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration (1963-1973), he led the investigation of Senate aide Bobby Baker in 1964. Jordan supported research in medical science and agriculture, industrial uses of farm products, missile development, and space exploration. He sponsored the Cotton Allotment Transfer Act, which assisted farmers with small allotments. Like most Southern senators, he was a supporter of segregation. Although he supported the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1964, he later joined a majority of senators in calling for American forces to be brought home. At this, his senior colleague, Sam Ervin, asked him, \\"Everett, have you lost your mind?\\" He was re-elected to the Senate in 1960 and 1966. Jordan was unseated in the 1972 Democratic primary by Representative Nick Galifianakis of Durham. Jordan polled only 44.5 percent in the primary, to 55.5 percent for Galifianakis. Galifianakis in turn was defeated by Republican Jesse Helms in the general election. At the time, Jordan was 76 and his health was beginning to fail. ===1972 sniper incident=== On May 29, 1972, Jordan escaped injury during a shooting while campaigning at Raleigh's North Hills Shopping Center, when 22-year-old Harvey Glenn McCloud opened fire from the parking lot with a Ruger 10/22 rifle, killing three people and injuring five others before taking his own life. Jordan press aide Wes Hayden sustained critical injuries in the shooting; he made a surprisingly swift recovery and returned to his office in just one month. McCloud's motives were inscrutable, although his mother described him as \\"nervous and depressed\\" prior to the incident. McCloud was not believed to be targeting Jordan, whose campaign stop at the shopping center was unannounced. ==Death and legacy== Jordan died at his home in Saxapahaw, at age 77. He is buried at Pine Hill Cemetery in Burlington. B. Everett Jordan Lake, in Chatham County, North Carolina, is named for Senator Jordan, as well as the elementary school in Saxapahaw, North Carolina, B. Everett Jordan Elementary School, part of the Alamance-Burlington School System. ==Personal life== In 1924, Jordan married Katherine McLean, to whom he remained married until his death. The couple had two sons, Benjamin Everett and John McLean, and one daughter, Rose Ann. ==ReferencesOral History Interview with Roger Gant (son-in-law) from Oral Histories of the American South Category:1896 births Category:1974 deaths Category:United States senators from North Carolina Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:Duke University Trinity College of Arts and Sciences alumni Category:People from Randolph County, North Carolina Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:North Carolina Democratic Party chairs Category:Jesse Helms Category:People from Alamance County, North Carolina ","title":"B.

The attraction may include a desire for actual sexual contact with the object, a fantasy of having sexual (or non-sexual) encounters with an animate or inanimate instance of the preferred object, the act of watching encounters between such objects, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into the preferred object. Agalmatophilia may also encompass Pygmalionism (from the myth of Pygmalion), which denotes love for an object of one's own creation.Ellis, 1927. Agalmatophilia is a form of Object sexuality. ==Clinical study== Agalmatophilia is a twentieth-century term for a medicalization of statue- eroticization widely attested in late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century legal medicine. Actual historical cases are few. Krafft-Ebing recorded in 1877 the case of a gardener falling in love with a statue of the Venus de Milo and being discovered attempting coitus with it.Kick, 2005. ==Fantasy, transformation, role-play== An important fantasy for some individuals is being transformed into the preferred object (such as a statue) and experiencing an associated state of immobility or paralysis. Such fantasies may be extended to role-playing, and the self-coined term used by fetishists who enjoy being transformed into what appears to be a \\"rubber doll\\" or \\"latex doll\\" or trapped within a statue and displayed in a museum. ==In the arts== Sexualised life- size dolls have extensively featured in the work of famous art photographers such as Hans Bellmer, Bernard Faucon, Helmut Newton, Morton Bartlett, Katan Amano, Kishin Shinoyama and Ryoichi Yoshida. Agalmatophilia features prominently in Luis Buñuel's L'Âge d'Or, in which the female protagonist sucks a statue's toe; in the novel Kort Amerikaans (\\"Crew Cut\\") (1962) by Dutch writer Jan Wolkers (and the movie of the same name, based on the novel, from 1979), in which the main character (in the movie played by Derek de Lint) develops an interest in, and ultimately is caught having sex with, a plaster torso; as well as in Tarsem Singh's thriller film The Cell (2000), which centers on a serial killer who bleaches his victims' bodies so they resemble dolls. The romantic comedy film Mannequin (1987) is about a window dresser who has a relationship with an animated mannequin, which he had found at a department store.

Jánošík has been the main character of many Slovak novels, poems, and films. According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor, a deed often attributed to the famous Robin Hood. The legend is known in neighboring Poland (under the name Jerzy Janoszik or Janiczek / Janicek) and the Czech Republic. The actual robber had little to do with the modern legend, whose content partly reflects the ubiquitous folk myths of a hero taking from the rich and giving to the poor. However, the legend was also shaped in important ways by the activists and writers in the 19th century when Jánošík became the key highwayman character in stories that spread in the north counties of the Kingdom of Hungary (much in present Slovakia) and among the local Gorals inhabitants of the Podhale region north of the Tatras. The image of Jánošík as a symbol of resistance to oppression was reinforced when poems about him became part of the Slovak and Czech middle and high school literature curriculum, and then again with the numerous films that propagated his modern legend in the 20th century. During the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising, one of the partisan groups bore his name. ==Biography== The page No. 39 of the protocol from the trial with Juraj Jánošík. It is archived under the title Fassio Janosikiana, anno 1713 die 16 mensis Martii. Jánošík is called here \\"agili Georgius Janošík Tyarchoviensis latronum et praedorum antesignatus\\" - cautious (or agile) Juro Jánošík from the Ťarchová, the chief of the thieves and outlaws. Jánošík was born shortly before his baptism on January 25, 1688. His parents were Martin Jánošík and Anna Čišníková from Terchová. His godparents were Jakub Merjad and Barbara Krištofíková. He grew up in the village of Terchová in the Habsburg monarchy's Kingdom of Hungary area (present-day Žilina District in northwestern Slovakia). He fought with the Kuruc insurgents when he was fifteen. After the lost Battle of Trenčín, Jánošík was recruited by the Habsburg army.Juraj Jánošík osobnosti.sk  životopisy, diela, tvorba, články, linky In autumn 1710, as a young prison guard in Bytča, he helped the imprisoned Tomáš Uhorčík escape.Kočiš (1986), p. 47 They formed a highwayman group and Jánošík became its leader at the age of 23, after Uhorčík left to settle in Klenovec.Kočiš (1986), p. 50 The group was active mostly in northwestern Kingdom of Hungary (today's Slovakia), around the Váh river between Važec and Východná,Odpočíva Jánošík na dne Liptovskej Mary? Aktuality Terchová  terchova-info.sk but the territory of their activity extended also to other parts of today's Slovakia, as well as to Poland and Moravia. Most of their victims were rich merchants. Under Jánošík's leadership, the group was exceptionally chivalrous: They did not kill any of the robbed victims and even helped an accidentally injured priest. They are also said to share their loot with the poor and this part of the legend may be based on the facts too. Jánošík was captured in autumn 1712 and detained at the Mansion of Hrachov, but was released soon afterwards.Kočiš (1986), p. 53 He was captured again in spring of 1713, in the Uhorčík's residence in Klenovec (Klenóc).Kočiš (1986), p. 56 Uhorčík lived there under the false name Martin Mravec at that time. According to a widespread legend, he was caught in a pub run by Tomáš Uhorčík, after slipping on spilled peas, thrown in his way by a treacherous old lady. Jánošík was imprisoned and tried in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, present Liptovský Mikuláš). His trial took place on March 16 and March 17, 1713 when he was sentenced to death. The date of his execution was not recorded, but it was customary to carry it out as soon as the trial was over. The manner of his execution, not in public awareness until the early 19th century, became part of his modern legend. A hook was pierced through his left side and he was left dangling on the gallows to die. This brutal way of execution was reserved for leaders of robber bands. However, sources diverge about how he was executed, and it is also possible that Jánošík was hanged.

His parents were Jethro Brown and Lucy Williamson Brown. After attending the University of North Carolina for one year, Brown was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons. On July 13, 1816, Brown married Mary Lumpkin Glenn. The couple had seven children. In 1828, upon the death of Bartlett Yancey, Jr., Brown was chosen in a special election to replace Yancey in the North Carolina Senate. Like Bartlett Yancey, Jr., before him, Brown was elected Speaker of the North Carolina Senate. In 1829, he was elected as a Jacksonian (the party that would become the Democratic Party) to succeed John Branch as a United States Senator from North Carolina. In the Senate, he chaired several committees, including the Agriculture Committee. Brown resigned his seat in 1840 due to a dispute with the state legislature. He was elected to the state Senate again in 1842, before spending some years out of the state. Leading up to the Civil War, Brown, a state senator again from 1858 to 1860, counseled in favor of North Carolina's remaining in the Union. However, after President Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to serve in the Union Army, Brown, along with most of his colleagues, supported secession. In 1868 Brown, still a Democrat, was again elected to the North Carolina Senate. However, the Reconstruction Republicans controlled the North Carolina Legislature and refused to seat Brown. He was replaced by Republican John W. Stephens. Brown was buried on the grounds at Rose Hill, just outside Yanceyville, North Carolina. Rose Hill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * H.G. Jones, \\"Bedford Brown\\" in William S.

He is also co-founder of Wealth for Common Good. He is an expert on economic inequality in the US, and has pioneered efforts to bring together investors and business leaders to speak out publicly against corporate practices and economic policies that increase economic inequality. ==Early life== Collins was born in Madison, Wisconsin and grew up in suburban Detroit where he attended the Cranbrook Schools. At age 7, he witnessed the 1967 Detroit riots and became concerned about inequality. He was involved in social change, including Earth Day 1970. He raised money for guide dogs and informed his neighborhood about the environment at a young age. Collins first gained public attention in 1985, when he gave an inheritance of $500,000 to several foundations at the age of 26.Fast Company interview with Collins When his libertarian conservative father Edward learned of his intentions, he was afraid his son was a Marxist, though Collins instead stated that he would rather be called a \\"Gandhian or Christian\\" and later left to live in a commune. ==Education== Collins is a graduate of Hampshire College (Bachelor of Arts, 1984), and holds a master's degree (1987) from the School of Community Economic Development at Southern New Hampshire University. ==Career== Between 1983 and 1991, Collins worked at the Institute for Community Economics, based in Greenfield, Massachusetts, providing technical advice to community land trusts and mobile home resident cooperatives. Between 1991 and 1995, he was director of the HOME Coalition in Massachusetts and a field organizer for the Tax Equity Alliance of Massachusetts (now the Mass Budget and Policy Center). In 1995, he co-founded, with Felice Yeskel and S.M. Miller, United for a Fair Economy in Boston, Massachusetts, a left-leaning national organization devoted to education about growing income and wealth inequality. According to Forbes in its 2002 article \\"The Leftist Billionaire Syndrome\\", Collins encouraged \\"rich people to promote left-liberal causes\\". Collins has worked with a number of prominent wealthy individuals, including William H. Gates, Sr. and George Soros in an effort to promote tax equity. Collins was also listed as part of the \\"members or friends\\" of the Boston Democratic Socialists of America in 2004. In 2005, he became a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, where he co-edits the web site, Inequality.org, and directs the Program on Inequality and the Common Good. In 2008, he cofounded Wealth for the Common Good, which subsequently merged in 2015 with the Patriotic Millionaires. At the Institute for Policy Studies, Collins research has looked at income and wealth inequality and the racial wealth divide. He has co-authored a number of studies including \\"Billionaire Bonanza\\" exploring the share of wealth flowing to the top 1 percent and Forbes 400, and the \\"Ever Growing Gap\\", which examines the future of the racial wealth divide. ==Publications== Collins has written a number of books about inequality, tax policy and social change philanthropy. In 2000, he co- authored the book, Robin Hood Was Right: A Guide to Giving Your Money for Social Change. In 2000 (revised in 2005), he co-authored with Felice Yeskel, Economic Apartheid in America: A Primer on Economic Inequality and Insecurity. Collins is coauthor, with William H. Gates Sr, of the 2003 book, Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes, which argues that the estate tax is both fair and necessary. In 2013, he authored 99 to 1: How Wealth Inequality is Wrecking the World and What We Can Do About It. His most recent book is Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good. ==Personal life== Collins is the great-grandson of German-born meatpacker Oscar F. Mayer (founder of the Oscar Mayer food corporation), and is the grandson of the American pianist and composer Edward Joseph Collins. Collins lives in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston with his partner, his daughter, and his partner's children. ==References== ==External links== * Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good Chelsea Green, 2016. * Book - 99 to 1: How Wealth Inequality is Wrecking the World and What We Can Do About It * * Patriotic Millionaires * Class Action * Inequality.org This website is a portal to statistics, news, and opinions on economic inequality in the US * United for a Fair Economy site Category:1959 births Category:American economics writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American socialists Category:Anti-globalization activists Category:Center for Economic and Policy Research Category:Hampshire College alumni Category:Living people Category:Michigan socialists Category:New Hampshire socialists Category:Southern New Hampshire University alumni Category:Wisconsin socialists Category:People from Jamaica Plain ","title":"Chuck Collins"},{"id":"516655","text":"John Pool (June 16, 1826August 16, 1884) was a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of North Carolina between 1868 and 1873. He was also the uncle of Congressman Walter Freshwater Pool. He was born in Pasquotank County, North Carolina near Elizabeth City and was tutored at home until his attendance at the University of North Carolina, where he studied law. He graduated and was admitted to the bar in 1847, practicing in his home city until serving in the North Carolina Senate in 1856 and 1858. Pool ran against Gov. John W. Ellis in the 1860 election as head of the \\"Opposition Party,\\" which consisted primarily of former Whigs, like himself. With the war-weariness increasing in civilian parts of the Confederacy during 1863, pro-Union activities began to become organized as resistance. The Loyal Order of the Heroes of America, also known as the \\"Red Strings\\", were started by several men from North Carolina, including Henderson Adams, North Carolina's State Auditor during this time. The actual leader was John Pool, who spent some time in a jail in Richmond, and who traveled through western Virginia in 1864.Turk, David S. The Union Hole: Unionist Activity and Local Conflict in Western Virginia. Bowie, MD: Heritage Books, 1994. Pages 49-50. While in West Virginia it was known that John Pool was part of (had joined in response to the Masons being against his \\"Red Stringed Beliefs\\") a fraternal brotherhood known only as ECV or E Clampus Vitus (different spellings were also recorded \\"E Clampsus Vatus, E Clampses Vitus and E Vitus Clampsus) which helped care for the families of fallen miners. The order is known to still be around today in the western states. He was elected by the legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate as a Republican once North Carolina was readmitted in 1868. After his single term, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. until his death in 1884.

An attorney from Buncombe County, North Carolina, Merrimon served in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1860 to 1861. He briefly served in the Confederate Army when the American Civil War broke out, but resigned to become solicitor (prosecutor) for North Carolina's eighth judicial district. After the war, Merrimon served as a state superior court judge, then returned to the practice of law, and was an unsuccessful Democratic (at the time, officially called the Conservative Party) candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 1872. With 49.5 percent of the vote, Merrimon lost an extremely close race to incumbent Tod R. Caldwell. Merrimon was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1872. He and former Gov. Zebulon B. Vance had already become intense political enemies, though both were affiliated with the Conservative Party. After Vance won the endorsement of the Conservative Party in the legislature, the minority Republicans in the legislature voted with Merrimon's supporters to elect him to the Senate (New York Times, October 14, 1878). During his term in the Senate, Merrimon gained a reputation as \\"one of the bitterest partisan Democrats in Congress\\" (New York Times, October 14, 1878). He was appointed to the 'South Carolina Committee,' a Congressional commission assigned to conduct hearings into voter intimidation and fraud during the 1876 elections in South Carolina—the elections which brought an end to Reconstruction and restored white supremacists to power. The only Democrat on the Committee, Merrimon badgered black and white Republican witnesses and attempted to downplay and excuse white atrocities. A full transcript of the testimony can be found in the 3 bound volumes (South Carolina in 1876) published by the 42nd Congress. After Vance was elected Governor in 1876, he began recruiting candidates to defeat Merrimon supporters in legislative races to lay the groundwork to take Merrimon's seat in the Senate. In the legislative election of 1878, the state Democrats ran two slates in many districts: one pledged to Merrimon and one pledged to Vance. The result was mixed; the Republicans gained 13 seats in the legislature, and the majority Democrats were still divided in their loyalties (Merrimon 40 to Vance 60 with 70 Republicans). The Republican legislators voted for Vance in the election in early 1879, giving him the majority. After being defeated for re-election, Merrimon served as an Associate Justice (1883–1889) and then Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court (1889 until his death in 1892). Merrimon Avenue in Asheville is named in his memory. His home at Raleigh, the Merrimon-Wynne House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and again in 2014 following a move. == References == ==External links== * *Congressional Biography Category:1830 births Category:1892 deaths Category:United States senators from North Carolina Category:North Carolina lawyers Category:Burials at Historic Oakwood Cemetery Category:Chief Justices of the North Carolina Supreme Court Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:North Carolina Democrats ","title":"Augustus Summerfield Merrimon"},{"id":"516660","text":"Ivo Robić (28 January 1923 – 9 March 2000) was a prominent Croatian singer- songwriter. ==Domestic career== Robić began his career as a soloist with the Radio Zagreb Orchestra, while studying at the same time in Zagreb. He performed during World War II on \\"Krugovalna postaja Zagreb\\" in an Esplanade hotel in Zagreb, Independent State of Croatia. During his career in what was then Socialist Republic of Croatia, he made more than one hundred records, mostly singles and schlagers. In his own country, the most memorable of his many schlagers might be \\"Vraćam se Zagrebe tebi\\" (Coming Back to You, My Zagreb), \\"Ta tvoja ruka mala\\" (That Little Hand of Yours), and \\"Tiho plove moje čežnje\\" (Silent Sail of My Yearnings). ==International achievements== A pioneer of popular Croatian music from the early 1950s on, Robić was an artist who successfully pursued both domestic and international careers for almost half a century. When he began, he was the only artist from Croatia whose records were available in the record shops of Europe and the rest of the world. Robić was nicknamed \\"Mister Morgen\\" following the success of his first international hit, \\"Morgen\\" (which means \\"tomorrow\\"), in 1959. The optimistic song was the first collaboration between Robić and Bert Kaempfert. Following its success in Germany, the German-language version became a #13 hit on the pop chart (Billboard Hot 100) in the United States, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. An English set of lyrics, \\"One More Sunrise\\", bearing no resemblance to the German lyrics, sung by Leslie Uggams, reached #98 on the same charts. It has also been performed by many other artists. Robić was active in recording for Germany's Polydor label. He performed and collaborated with Kaempfert, Freddy Quinn, and Dean Martin. Of the Kaempfert composed international hit of 1966 Strangers in the Night he sang the Yugoslav and German versions Stranci u Noći with lyrics by Marija Renota and Fremde in der Nacht with lyrics by Kurt Feltz. Robić's other international hits are \\"Muli-Song\\" (1960), \\"Mit 17 fängt das Leben erst an\\" (1960), \\"Ein ganzes Leben lang\\" (1962), \\"Rot ist der Wein\\" (1966), and \\"Ich zeig' dir den Sonnenschein\\" (1971). ==References== ==External links== * Morgen * Strangers in the night * Morgen, in Croatian and German languages * \\"Stranci u noći\\",(Strangers in the night), in original Croatian language * Ivo Robić - Biografija * Ivo Robić's recordings Category:1923 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Garešnica Category:Croatian pop singers Category:Croatian songwriters Category:Croatian male singers Category:Yugoslav musicians Category:Polydor Records artists Category:Laurie Records artists Category:Burials at Mirogoj Cemetery Category:Musicians from Zagreb Category:20th-century singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Ivo Robić"},{"id":"516669","text":"Jeter Connelly Pritchard (July 12, 1857 – April 10, 1921) was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and of the United States Circuit Courts for the Fourth Circuit and previously was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. ==Education and career== Born on July 12, 1857, in Jonesboro, Washington County, Tennessee, Pritchard was apprenticed to the printer's trade, then moved to Bakersville, Mitchell County, North Carolina, in 1873. He became joint editor and owner of the Roan Mountain Republican. He attended the Martins Creek Academy in Tennessee. He was a Presidential Elector on the Republican Party ticket in North Carolina in 1880. He read law and was admitted to the bar in 1889. He entered private practice in Marshall, North Carolina, starting in 1889. He was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1885 to 1889, and from 1891 to 1893. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1888 and an unsuccessful candidate for United States Senator in 1891. He was President of the North Carolina Protective Tariff League in 1891. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States House of Representatives of the 53rd United States Congress in 1892. ==Congressional service== Pritchard was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1894 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Senator Zebulon Baird Vance. He was reelected in 1897 and served from January 23, 1895, to March 3, 1903. The victory of the Republican-Populist alliance (or \\"fusion\\") in the 1894 legislative elections, and their subsequent domination of the North Carolina General Assembly was the key factor in Pritchard's initial election and subsequent reelection. He was Chairman of the Committee on Civil Service and Retrenchment for the 54th and 55th United States Congresses and Chairman of the Committee on Patents for the 56th and 57th United States Congresses. On October 21 of 1898, Pritchard sent a letter to President William McKinley, requesting federal marshals to protect black voters in the upcoming election. He warned that Democrats were stockpiling weapons and threatening black voters, and said that Democrat claims of \\"Negro domination\\" were without basis. The letter was discussed by McKinley and his cabinet on October 24, but federal marshals were not sent as Governor Daniel Lindsay Russell had not made the request. As a result, intimidation by Red Shirts kept black voters away from the polls, resulting in a sweeping Democrat victory. On the day following the election, the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 broke out.Zucchino, pp. 132-134 ==Federal judicial service== Pritchard was nominated by President Theodore Roosevelt on November 10, 1903, to an Associate Justice seat on the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) vacated by Associate Justice Harry M. Clabaugh. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 16, 1903, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on June 1, 1904, due to his elevation to the Fourth Circuit. While in office Pritchard twice offered resolutions demanding that the Senate declare the grandfather clause a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, but both attempts failed.Zucchino, pp. 312 Pritchard was nominated by President Roosevelt on April 27, 1904, to a joint seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Fourth Circuit vacated by Judge Charles Henry Simonton. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 27, 1904, and received his commission the same day. On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served only on the Court of Appeals. His service terminated on April 10, 1921, due to his death in Asheville, North Carolina. He was interred in the Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, near fellow North Carolina Senators Thomas Lanier Clingman and Zebulon Baird Vance. ==Family== Mrs Jeter Connelly Pritchard Pritchard was the father of George M.

He wanted to keep the Red Scare contained so people would not catch wind of it and live in fear. He wrote and sponsored the Overman Act of 1918, which gave President Woodrow Wilson extraordinary powers to coordinate government agencies in wartime. Overman chaired a Senate committee after World War I to investigate activities during the first Red Scare, which many see as a precursor to the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1922, Overman was one of the leaders of a 1-hour, 45 minute filibuster that helped defeat the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. In his lengthy speech, he said that the bill was a partisan attempt to solidify the Republican hold on the northern black vote, that the bill had been written by a black person, and that ignorant black people in the South would interpret the bill as permission to \\"commit the foulest of outrages.\\"\\"Filibuster Kills Anti-Lynching Bill\\", New York Times, December 3, 1922 ==Overman Committee== Overman chaired the Overman Committee, a subcommittee that investigated foreign propaganda and Bolshevism in the United States during the first Red Scare from 1919 to 1921.He was chosen to head the commission called the Overman Committee by President Woodrow Wilson.

Morrison (October 5, 1869August 20, 1953) was the 55th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1921 to 1925. ==Early life and career== He was born in 1869 in Richmond County, North Carolina. In 1898, Morrison participated in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, a violent coup d'état by a group of white supremacists. They expelled opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more than 300 people. The governor of North Carolina, Daniel Lindsay Russell, was forced to flee from Wilmington to Raleigh. Morrison boarded in train in Maxton, North Carolina in the company of a small band of Red Shirts and warned Russell that a more hostile band of Red Shirts were waiting at a later stop. He advised Russell to hide in the baggage car to avoid being lynched, which he did.*, pp. 172-173 In 1900, he was elected to the North Carolina Senate for one term.NCpedia biography of Cameron Morrison ==Governorship== With the backing of Sen. Furnifold Simmons and the help of race-baiting tactics employed by A. D. Watts, Morrison defeated O. Max Gardner in the 1920 Democratic primary for governor.News & Observer: \\"What the obituary didn't say\\" by Rob Christensen In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee John J. Parker. He came to be called \\"the Good Roads governor\\" for his support of a modern highway system. Morrison also pushed for increased funds for public education, while also battling the teaching of the theory of evolution. ==Later career== He was later appointed to serve as a United States Senator for the state of North Carolina (after the death of Lee S. Overman) between 1930 and 1932, but lost his seat in the Democratic primary runoff to Robert R. Reynolds. Morrison was later elected to one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He again lost a Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 1944, to Clyde R. Hoey. He died in Quebec City in 1953. A ten-story residence hall on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill is named in his honor. His home at Charlotte, Morrocroft, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==References== ==External links== *Cameron A.

Excitations of copper 3d orbitals on the CuO2-plane of a high Tc superconductor; The ground state (blue) is x2-y2 orbitals; the excited orbitals are in green; the arrows illustrate inelastic x-ray spectroscopy In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature). The lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: spontaneous or induced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) usually occurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, returning the system to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state). This return to a lower energy level is often loosely described as decay and is the inverse of excitation. Long-lived excited states are often called metastable. Long-lived nuclear isomers and singlet oxygen are two examples of this. == Atomic excitation == A simple example of this concept comes by considering the hydrogen atom. The ground state of the hydrogen atom corresponds to having the atom's single electron in the lowest possible orbital (that is, the spherically symmetric \\"1s\\" wave function, which, so far, has demonstrated to have the lowest possible quantum numbers). By giving the atom additional energy (for example, by the absorption of a photon of an appropriate energy), the electron is able to move into an excited state (one with one or more quantum numbers greater than the minimum possible). If the photon has too much energy, the electron will cease to be bound to the atom, and the atom will become ionized. After excitation the atom may return to the ground state or a lower excited state, by emitting a photon with a characteristic energy. Emission of photons from atoms in various excited states leads to an electromagnetic spectrum showing a series of characteristic emission lines (including, in the case of the hydrogen atom, the Lyman, Balmer, Paschen and Brackett series.) An atom in a high excited state is termed a Rydberg atom. A system of highly excited atoms can form a long-lived condensed excited state e.g. a condensed phase made completely of excited atoms: Rydberg matter. Hydrogen can also be excited by heat or electricity. == Perturbed gas excitation == A collection of molecules forming a gas can be considered in an excited state if one or more molecules are elevated to kinetic energy levels such that the resulting velocity distribution departs from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. This phenomenon has been studied in the case of a two-dimensional gas in some detail, analyzing the time taken to relax to equilibrium. == Calculation of excited states == Excited states are often calculated using coupled cluster, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, multi-configurational self-consistent field, configuration interaction, and time-dependent density functional theory. ==Excited state absorption== The excitation of a system (an atom or molecule) from one excited state to a higher energy excited state with the absorption of a photon is called excited state absorption (ESA). Excited state absorption is possible only when an electron has been already excited from the ground state to a lower excited state. The excited state absorption is usually an undesired effect, but it can be useful in upconversion pumping.{url = https://www.rp- photonics.com/excited_state_absorption.html} Excited state absorption measurements are done using pump-probe techniques such as flash photolysis. However, it is not easy to measure them compared to ground-state absorption and in some cases complete bleaching of the ground state is required to measure excited state absorption. ==Reaction== A further consequence of excited state formation may be reaction of the atom or molecule in its excited state, as in photochemistry. == See also == * Rydberg formula * Stationary state * Repulsive state == References == == External links == * NASA background information on ground and excited states Category:Quantum mechanics ","title":"Excited state"},{"id":"516681","text":"Smithers is a surname of British origin.

He was one half of the duo Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, who were heralded as the new \\"voice of modern folk music\\" in the months before Carter's unexpected death in July 2002. reprinting \\"New songs from old places: Dave Carter, Tracy Grammer, and Joan Baez,\\" Boston Globe, September 9, 2001. They were ranked as number one on the year-end list for \\"Top Artists\\" on the Folk Music Radio Airplay Chart for 2001 and 2002, and their popularity has endured in the years following Carter's death. Joan Baez, who went on tour with the duo in 2002, spoke of Carter's songs in the same terms that she once used to promote a young Bob Dylan: > \\"There is a special gift for writing songs that are available to other > people, and Dave's songs are very available to me. It's a kind of genius, > you know, and Dylan has the biggest case of it. But I hear it in Dave's > songs, too. Carter's songs were often noted for their poetic imagery, spirituality and storytelling while retaining connection to the country music of his southern American upbringing. Carter's memory has been kept alive by his many admirers, most notably his former partner. Tracy Grammer has continued to introduce previously unrecorded songs and recordings that the duo were working on prior to Carter's death. == Early life and education == Dave Carter was born in Oxnard, California. His father was a mathematician and a petroleum engineer and his mother was a science teacher and a charismatic Christian. Carter was raised in Oklahoma and Texas and would draw on his rural upbringing in many of his songs. He studied classical piano from age 4 to about age 12, when he took up guitar. At 17, he left home to hitchhike around the country, especially the Midwestern United States (Great Plains area). After graduating with degrees in music (cello) and fine arts from the University of Oklahoma, he moved to Portland, Oregon, where he continued his education at Portland State University, earning a degree in mathematics. He began an advanced degree in mathematics, but a personal epiphany led him to realize that this was not to be his field. He went on to study what he called \\"the psychology of mystical experience\\" at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto and the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, and worked as an embedded systems programmer for several years before taking up music full-time in the mid-1990s. Carter was greatly influenced by mythologist Joseph Campbell, who visited his college, and American mystic Carlos Castaneda. He was also influenced by the American landscape, Arthurian mythology, the environment, and transcendental psychology. == Partnership with Tracy Grammer == Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer Prior to his death, Carter released three albums with Grammer: When I Go (1998); Tanglewood Tree (2000); and Drum Hat Buddha (2001). The duo re-recorded many of the songs from Snake Handlin' Man, plus two previously unrecorded songs, in early 2002. The CD, called Seven Is the Number, was released by Tracy Grammer in 2006. A collection of the duo's holiday recordings called American Noel was compiled by Tracy Grammer and released in 2008 by Signature Sounds. == Transgender identity == In 2000 Carter revealed to Grammer that he had struggled with gender dysphoria since his early teen years. Grammer later said, \\"... he was exploring a gender change and that altered the dynamics of our off-stage relationship. It actually made things quite difficult for us personally, but anyone on the outside would not have known that. It was just a process that we were going through and that, thankfully, we reconciled with by the time he died.\\" Of this timeframe, Grammer said: \\"... We even had a whole plan for the unveiling. He was going to release one more manly ‘Cowboy Dave’ album, and I would introduce myself as a solo artist. Then he would go change and we would come back as an all-girl band, calling ourselves The Butterfly Conservatory. He would be she and that would be that.\\" == Death and tributes == Carter died of a massive heart attack on July 19, 2002, in a hotel room in Hadley, Massachusetts after returning from an early morning run. He and Grammer were slated to play that weekend at the Green River Festival in Greenfield and were booked that summer to play many of the nation's top folk festivals and folk clubs. He was 49. Carter's death came as a great shock to the folk music community. Tracy Grammer gave her account of Carter's final moments in a letter to fans: > \\"Yesterday, shortly after he went unconscious, he came back for a lucid > minute or two to tell me, 'I just died... Baby, I just died...' There was a > look of wonder in his eyes, and though I cried and tried to deny it to him, > I knew he was right and he was on his way. He stayed with me a minute more > but despite my attempts to keep him with me, I could see he was already > riding that thin chiffon wave between here and gone. He loved beauty, he was > hopelessly drawn to the magic and the light in all things. I figure he saw > something he could not resist out of the corner of his eye and flew into it. > Despite the fact that every rescue attempt was made by paramedics and > hospital staff and the death pronouncement officially came at 12:08 pm > Eastern Time, I believe he died in my arms in our favorite hotel, leaving me > with those final words. That's the true story I am going to tell.\\" Many had predicted that the duo was destined for success beyond the typical folk music circles. Jim Olsen, president of Carter's record label, Signature Sounds, said, \\"I always believed it would only take one cover by a major star to unveil his work to the rest of the world; and I was convinced that was going to happen. Somebody was going to open the door for them; and the thing about Dave's music is that once people heard it, they became lifelong fans.\\" Fellow folksinger and journalist Matt Watroba wrote, \\"It would make sense at this point, to say that Dave Carter was on the verge of something big. The truth, however, is that Dave was something big already. He moved the people lucky enough to know him or his music in a way that has launched an outpouring of tributes, memories and love.\\" Grammer decided to keep the duo's appointment to play the 2002 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival the following week and a tribute concert was arranged. The tribute included performances by a number of Carter's admirers singing his songs. Highlights included Chris Smither's cover of \\"Crocodile Man\\", Mark Erelli singing \\"Cowboy Singer\\", a rendition of \\"Happytown\\" by The Kennedys, and \\"Farewell to Saint Dolores\\" by Eddie From Ohio. Grammer herself opened the show with \\"The Mountain\\" and closed with \\"Gentle Soldier of My Soul\\". Several artists have since written tributes in Carter's honor and in 2005 Grammer released Flower of Avalon, including nine previously unrecorded songs by Carter. == Songwriting == Dave Carter's songs have been covered by many others, most notably by Judy Collins and Willie Nelson (\\"When I Go\\"), Joan Baez (\\"The Mountain\\"), Lucy Kaplansky (\\"Cowboy Singer\\") and Chris Smither (\\"Crocodile Man\\"). Tributes to Dave following his death were written by Tracy Grammer (\\"The Verdant Mile\\") and Richard Shindell (\\"So Says the Whippoorwill\\"), among others. One song, \\"Gentle Arms of Eden\\", was added to the hymnal in at least one Unitarian Universalist congregation. More of Carter's songs were recorded by Tracy Grammer on her 2005 album Flower of Avalon. ==Discography== * Snake Handlin' Man, Dave Carter (self-release, 1995, out of print) * When I Go, Dave Carter with Tracy Grammer (self-release 1998, Signature Sounds 2002) * Tanglewood Tree, Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer (Signature Sounds, 2000) * Drum Hat Buddha, Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer (Signature Sounds, 2001) * Seven Is the Number Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer (Tracy Grammer Music, 2006) * American Noel Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer (Signature Sounds, 2008) * Little Blue Egg Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer (Red House Records, 2012–2017) * Joy My Love Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer (Red House Records, 2012–2017) limited edition EP ===Partial List of Covers=== Songs written by Dave Carter performed by other artists: * Flower of Avalon (Signature Sounds, 2005–2019 / Tracy Grammer Music), Tracy Grammer, includes nine previously unrecorded Dave Carter songs. * \\"The Mountain\\", in 2001 concerts, Joan Baez * \\"The River Where She Sleeps\\", from A Crooked Line (2001), Darryl Purpose * \\"Tanglewood Tree\\", from Clearwater (2002), Chris and Meredith Thompson * \\"Crocodile Man\\", from Train Home (Hightone Records, 2003), Chris Smither * \\"Farewell to St. Dolores\\", Gambling Eden (2003), Rani Arbo * \\"Gentle Arms of Eden\\", from Temporary Stay (2003), Pat Wictor * \\"Gentle Arms of Eden\\", from Side of the Road (2003), Ellis Paul and Vance Gilbert * \\"Walkin' Away from Caroline\\", from God's Poet Now, (2003, EP to benefit the Dave Carter Memorial Fund), Erik Balkey * \\"Cat Eye Willie Claims His Lover\\", from Sweet Mystery of Life (2004), Full Frontal Folk * \\"Cowboy Singer\\", from The Red Thread (Red House Records, 2004), Lucy Kaplansky * \\"Gentle Soldier of My Soul\\", from Paintbrush (2004), Diane Zeigler * \\"The Mountain\\", LIVE (2004), Chris and Meredith Thompson * \\"Quickdraw Southpaw's Last Hurrah\\", from One Horse Town (2005), Jim Henry * \\"When I Go\\", from Bristlecone Pine (2006), Bryan Bowers * \\"Happytown (It's Alright with Me)\\" and \\"Gypsy Rose\\", from Songs of the Open Road (Appleseed Recordings, 2006), The Kennedys * \\"When I Go\\", from Stand (2003), The Kennedys * \\"When I Go\\", from Heaven is So High and I'm So Far Down (RiskyDisk, 2006), Pat Wictor * \\"Gun Metal Eyes\\", from Liberty Tree (Songs from the Kitchen Table) (2007), Mission Street Project * \\"Kate and the Ghost of Lost Love\\", from Open The Gate (2007) Sense of Wonder * \\"When I Go\\" from Live (2003), Ronny Cox * \\"The Mountain\\" from Not Far Now (2009) by Richard Shindell * \\"Tanglewood Tree\\" from Wicked Girls (2010) by Seanan McGuire * \\"Girl from Golden\\" from Next Time Around (2012) by Darryl Purpose * \\"Gentle Arms of Eden\\" from Horsetamer (2013) by Julia Ecklar * \\"Farewell to Saint Dolores\\" from The Pine Hill Project (2015) by Richard Shindell & Lucy Kaplansky * \\"When I Go\\" from Strangers Again (2015) by Judy Collins feat.

Almost from the outset of his Senate career, \\"Our Bob,\\" as he was known among his local supporters,See \\"Buncombe Bob,\\" by Arthur L. Shelton, in The American Mercury, October 1932, at p. 140-47, for a portrait of his senatorial years. acquired distinction as a passionate isolationist and increasingly as an apologist for Nazi aggression in Europe. Even after America's entry into World War II, according to a contemporary study of subversive elements in America, he \\"publicly endorsed the propaganda efforts of Gerald L. K. Smith,\\" whose scurrilous publication The Cross and the Flag \\"violently assailed the United States war effort and America's allies.\\"Michael Sayers and Albert E. Kahn, Sabotage, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1942, p. 249. One of the nation's most influential fascists, Smith likewise collaborated with Reynolds on The Defender, an antisemitic newspaper that was partly owned by Reynolds.Charles Higham, American Swastika, Doubleday & Co., Garden City, N.Y., 1985, p. 52. Reynolds occasionally turned over his Senate office facilities to subversive propagandists and allowed them to use his franking to mail their literature postage-free.Sayers and Kahn, pp. 193, 227. ==Early life== He was born on June 18, 1884 in Asheville, North Carolina at his family's estate, the Reynolds House. He was the son of William Taswell Reynolds (1850–1892) and Mamie Elizabeth Spears (1862–1939). He was descended from a family of Revolutionary War heroes and pioneers, politicians, and property owners, including his maternal great-grandfather, Colonel Daniel Smith, a Revolutionary War hero of the Battle of Kings Mountain. His siblings included George Spears Reynolds (1881–1924) and Jane Reynolds Wood (1888–1927). Reynolds attended public and private schools, including Weaver College, a preparatory school, before entering the University of North Carolina. While at UNC, he played football, ran track, and was the editor of the sports section of The Daily Tar Heel. He left UNC without a degree, but he was still accepted at the University of North Carolina School of Law. He did not officially enroll, but attended lectures and was eventually admitted to the Bar in North Carolina, in 1908. ==Early career== After passing the bar exam, Reynolds began practicing in Asheville with his brother. He was elected prosecuting attorney, serving from 1910 to 1914, and during World War I, registered for military service. He was never drafted but briefly served in the National Guard. In 1924, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina, losing to J. Elmer Long in the Democratic primary. In 1926, Reynolds first ran for the US Senate, but was unsuccessful. He ran again in 1932 and defeated former Governor and interim Senator Cameron Morrison in the Democratic primary runoff by nearly two-to-one after running a particularly nasty, populist campaign in which he accused Morrison of being a Communist sympathizer. During one campaign speech, he proclaimed, \\"Cam likes fish eggs, and Red Russian fish eggs at that. Don't you want a Senator who likes North Carolina hen eggs?\\" ==US Senate== In his first term, Reynolds was in favor of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and believed that it provided much-needed jobs for his North Carolinans. That allowed the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to be built. Reynolds favored taxing the wealthy and imposing regulations on the economy. In addition, he supported Social Security, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Works Progress Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which raised tobacco prices. Reynolds initially supported Roosevelt's Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 to pack the Supreme Court but later joined other Democrats in sending it back to the Judiciary Committee, effectively killing the bill. Reynolds was an advocate of \\"Fortress America\\" and supported a strong national defense, the expansion of the Navy, and an increase in the size of the Army and Air Force. He vociferously opposed Roosevelt's efforts to revise the Neutrality Acts. Reynolds and Senator John Overton of Louisiana, were the only senators from the South to vote against repeal of the arms embargo. Therefore, during his 1938 re-election campaign, Roosevelt recruited Franklin W. Hancock, Jr. to oppose Reynolds in the Democratic primary, but Reynolds won handily.Pleasants, Julian M. Buncombe Bob: The Life & Times of Robert Rice Reynolds. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000; American National Biography; Dictionary of American Biography; Reynolds, Robert Rice. Gypsy Trails. Asheville: Advocate Publishing Co., 1923. In 1941, Reynolds became chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. A confidential 1943 analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office stated that Reynolds The scholar who, in 1973, edited and analyzed Berlin's report described his allegations regarding Reynolds' sympathy to fascism as \\"both intemperate and gratuitous.\\" By 1944, the Democratic Party had had enough of Reynolds and chose former Governor Clyde R. Hoey to seek Reynolds's seat in the primary. As a result, Reynolds did not seek reelection. Hoey won the primary and went on to win the general election in a landslide victory over a Republican opponent. Reynolds did seek to return to the Senate in 1950, but he was by then hopelessly discredited and won only 10% in the Democratic primary, behind Frank Porter Graham and Willis Smith. ==Later life== After leaving public life, Reynolds practiced law and real estate until his death, in Asheville. He wrote the book Gypsy Trails, Around the World in an Automobile; Asheville, NC: Advocate Publishing Company (presumed date 1923).World Catalog ==Personal life== Reynolds married five times throughout his life and had four children. His first marriage was in 1910 to Frances Jackson (1889–1913). Before her death from Typhoid fever in 1913, they had two children together: *Frances Jackson Reynolds (1910–1955) *Robert Rice Reynolds, Jr. (1913–1950) In 1914, he married 17-year-old Mary Bland (b. 1897). Less than a year after their marriage, he left his new wife and their child. Before their divorce in 1917 and her three subsequent marriages, they had one daughter together: *Mary Bland Reynolds, who died of Hodgkin's disease. In 1921, he married, for the third time, Denise D'Arcy, a French woman he met in New York. Reynolds met D'Arcy while he was traveling around the country in his truck and accidentally struck her as she crossed the street. Within five days, he had announced that they had fallen in love and were going to get married. The marriage dissolved after one year, and D'Arcy obtained a legal separation from Reynolds in 1922 and moved back to France. The divorce was ultimately finalized in 1929. On February 27, 1931, he married for the fourth time to Eva Brady (1898–1934), a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer from Chicago, who came to Asheville looking for a cure for tuberculosis.

Cadwallon died in the year after the Battle of Hatfield Chase, which Bede reports as occurring in October 633; but if Bede's years are believed to have actually started in September, as some historians have argued, then Hatfield Chase would have occurred in 632, and therefore Cadwallon would have died in 633. Other historians have argued against this view of Bede's chronology, however, favoring the dates as he gives them.) was the King of Gwynedd from around 625 until his death in battle. The son and successor of Cadfan ap Iago, he is best remembered as the King of the Britons who invaded and conquered the Kingdom of Northumbria, defeating and killing its king, Edwin, prior to his own death in battle against Oswald of Bernicia. His conquest of Northumbria, which he held for a year or two after Edwin died, made him the last Briton to hold substantial territory in eastern Britain until the rise of the House of Tudor.Koch, p. 315. He was thereafter remembered as a national hero by the Britons and as a tyrant by the Anglo- Saxons of Northumbria. ==History== As with other figures of the era little is certainly known of Cadwallon's early life or reign. The primary source of information about him is the Ecclesiastical History of the English People of the Anglo-Saxon writer Bede, who is strongly critical of him. Cadwallon consistently appears in the genealogies of the Kings of Gwynedd as the son of Cadfan ap Iago and a descendant of Maelgwn Gwynedd and Cunedda.Harleain genealogy 1.Jesus College MS 20 genealogy 22. Historian Alex Woolf, however, presents the case that the genealogists have erroneously inserted Bede's Cadwallon into the pedigree of the unrelated Kings of Gwynedd as son of Cadfan. Instead, Woolf suggests that Bede's Cadwallon was the Catguallaun liu found in genealogies as son of Guitcun and grandson of Sawyl Penuchel, rulers in the Hen Ogledd or Brythonic-speaking area of northern Britain.Woolf 2004. Whatever the case may be, Cadwallon was certainly affected by the ambitions of Edwin, King of Northumbria. Bede, writing about a century after Cadwallon's death, describes Edwin, the most powerful king in Britain, conquering the Brittonic kingdom of Elmet (what is now western Yorkshire) and ejecting its king, Cerdic. This opened the door to the Irish Sea, and Edwin successfully extended his rule to the \\"Mevanian Islands\\" – the Isle of Man and Anglesey.Bede, H. E., Book II, chapter 9. Bede calls these two islands the Mevanian Islands. The Annales Cambriae says that Cadwallon was besieged at Glannauc (now Puffin Island, a small island off eastern Anglesey), and dates this to 629.Annales Cambriae, 629. Surviving Welsh poetry and the Welsh Triads portray Cadwallon as a heroic leader against Edwin. They refer to a battle at Digoll (Long Mountain) and mention that Cadwallon spent time in Ireland before returning to Britain to defeat Edwin.D. P. Kirby, The Earliest English Kings (1991, 2000), pages 71–72. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (which includes a fairly extensive account of Cadwallon's life but is largely legendary—for example, Geoffrey has Cadwallon surviving until after the Battle of the Winwaed in 654 or 655), Cadwallon went to Ireland and then to the island of Guernsey. From there, according to Geoffrey, Cadwallon led an army into Dumnonia, where he encountered and defeated the Mercians besieging Exeter, and forced their king, Penda of Mercia, into an alliance. Geoffrey also reports that Cadwallon married a half-sister of Penda.Geoffrey of Monmouth, The History of the Kings of Britain, Part Eight: \\"The Saxon Domination.\\" However, his history is, on this as well as all matters, suspect, and it should be treated with caution. In any case, Penda and Cadwallon together made war against the Northumbrians. The Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633 ended in the defeat and death of Edwin and his son Osfrith.Bede, H. E., Book II, chapter 20. After this, the Kingdom of Northumbria fell into disarray, divided between its sub-kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia,Bede, H. E., Book III, chapter 1. but the war continued: according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, \\"Cadwallon and Penda went and did for the whole land of Northumbria\\".Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, manuscript E, year 633. Translated by Michael Swanton (1996, 1998). Bede says that Cadwallon was besieged by the new king of Deira, Osric, \\"in a strong town\\"; Cadwallon, however, \\"sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, by surprise, and destroyed him [Osric] and all his army.\\" After this, according to Bede, Cadwallon ruled over the \\"provinces of the Northumbrians\\" for a year, \\"not like a victorious king, but like a rapacious and bloody tyrant.\\" Furthermore, Bede tells us that Cadwallon, \\"though he bore the name and professed himself a Christian, was so barbarous in his disposition and behaviour, that he neither spared the female sex, nor the innocent age of children, but with savage cruelty put them to tormenting deaths, ravaging all their country for a long time, and resolving to cut off all the race of the English within the borders of Britain.\\" Bede's extremely negative portrayal of Cadwallon as a genocidal tyrant cannot be taken at face value. Cadwallon's alliance with the Anglo-Saxon Penda undermines Bede's assertion that Cadwallon had attempted to exterminate the English.Koch, p. 316. Additionally, the fact that Cædwalla of Wessex a generation after Cadwallon's death bore a name derived directly from the British Cadwallon suggests that Cadwallon's reputation could not have been so poor among the Saxons of Wessex as it was in Northumbria. The new king of Bernicia, Eanfrith, was also killed by Cadwallon when the former went to him in an attempt to negotiate peace. However, Cadwallon was defeated by an army under Eanfrith's brother, Oswald, at the Battle of Heavenfield, \\"though he had most numerous forces, which he boasted nothing could withstand\\". Cadwallon was killed at a place called \\"Denis's-brook\\". ==See also== *Kings of Wales family trees ==Notes== ==References== * *Alex Woolf, \\"Caedualla Rex Brittonum and the Passing of the Old North\\", in Northern History, Vol. 41, Issue 1, March 2004, pages 5–24. ==External links== * Category:6th-century births Category:634 deaths Category:Anglo-Saxon warriors Category:Characters in works by Geoffrey of Monmouth Category:Monarchs of Gwynedd Category:Medieval Welsh killed in battle Category:7th-century Welsh monarchs ","title":"Cadwallon ap Cadfan"},{"id":"516726","text":"Cecily April Adams (February 6, 1958 – March 3, 2004) was an American actress, casting director, and lyricist. ==Early life== Adams was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York, the daughter of comic actor Don Adams and singer Adelaide Efantis.

From 1815 to 1830 a conscious program by conservative statesmen, including Metternich and Castlereagh, was put in place to contain revolution and revolutionary forces by restoring old orders, particularly previous ruling aristocracies. In South America, on the other hand and in light of the Monroe Doctrine, this was a time in which the Spanish and Portuguese colonies gained independence. Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria renewed their commitment to prevent any restoration of Bonapartist power and agreed to meet regularly in conferences to discuss their common interests. This period contains the time of the Holy Alliance, which was a military agreement. The Concert of Europe was the political framework that grew out of the Quadruple Alliance, in November 1815. The main aim was to restore the conservative order in order to stay in power.The wildspread nationalism was a threat to the aristocracy. ==Congress of Vienna== In March 1814 the military coalition of Napoleon's four major opponents -- Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia -- had agreed to remain united not only to defeat France, but to ensure peace after the war. After Napoleon's defeat, this alliance restored the Bourbon monarchy to France and agreed to meet in Vienna, Austria in September 1814 to arrange a settlement. This meeting would become to be known as the Congress of Vienna. The goal of the conservatives at this meeting, led by Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria, was said to be to reestablish peace and stability in Europe. To accomplish this, a new balance of power had to be established. The way in which Metternich and the other four represented states sought to do this was to restore old ruling families and create buffer zones between major powers. So, to contain the still powerful French the House of Orange-Nassau was put on the throne in the Netherlands, which formerly comprised the Dutch Republic and the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium). To the southeast of France, Piedmont (officially part of the kingdom of Sardinia) was enlarged. The Bourbon dynasty was restored to France and Spain as well as a return of other legitimate rulers to the Italian states. And, to contain the Russian empire, Poland was divided up between Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Austria and Prussia were allowed to keep some of their Polish territories while a new, nominally independent Polish kingdom was established with the Romanov dynasty of Russia as its hereditary monarchs. Also, the German Confederation was created to replace the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine. During the Congress of Vienna, Napoleon had escaped from Elba and launched his unsuccessful \\"Hundred Days\\". This ultimately did not disrupt the meeting but as a punishment to the people of France for allowing Napoleon back in power, they were forced to pay an indemnity, accept an army of occupation for five years and have France's borders returned to those of 1790. The European order put into action by the Congress of Vienna led to the avoidance of a general European conflict for nearly a century (1818-1914). ==Ideology of conservatism== The Congress of Vienna was only the beginning conservative reaction bent on containing the liberal and nationalist forces unleashed by the French revolution. Metternich and most of the other participants at the Congress of Vienna were representatives of the ideology known as conservatism. Conservatism generally dates back to 1790 when the best-known figure of conservatism, Edmund Burke, wrote Reflections on the Revolution in France. Burke, however, was not the only kind of conservative; Joseph de Maistre was a very influential spokesperson for a counterrevolutionary and authoritarian conservatism. De Maistre believed in hereditary monarchies because they would bring \\"order to society,\\" a commodity in short supply in his eyes after the chaos of the French Revolution. Despite differences, most conservatives held to some general principles and beliefs, those being: *Obedience to political authority *The centrality of organized religion to social order *Hatred of revolutionary upheavals *Unwillingness to accept liberal demands for civil liberties and representative government and nationalistic aspirations generated by French revolutionary era *Precedence of community over individual rights *Structured and ordered society *Tradition as a guide for an ordered society Many conservatives, such as Metternich, were not opposed to reforming governments, but said that such changes must be taken gradually, and that radical revolutions are not aimed at benefiting the masses, but rather are simply a power grab by the new middle-class. After 1815, the political philosophy of conservatism was supported by hereditary monarchs, government bureaucracies, landowning aristocracies and revived churches (Protestant or Catholic). The conservative forces appeared dominant after 1815, both internationally and domestically.
