Nearly half of all refugees are children, and almost one in three children living outside their country of birth is a refugee.Emily Garin, Jan Beise, Lucia Hug, and Danzhen You. 2016. ‚ÄúUprooted: The Growing Crisis for Refugee and Migrant Children.‚Äù UNICEF. https://www.unicef.org/videoaudio/PDFs/Uprooted.pdf. These numbers encompass children whose refugee status has been formally confirmed, as well as children in refugee-like situations. In addition to facing the direct threat of violence resulting from conflict, forcibly displaced children also face various health risks, including: disease outbreaks and long-term psychological trauma, inadequate access to water and sanitation, nutritious food, and regular vaccination schedules. Refugee children, particularly those without documentation and those who travel alone, are also vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Although many communities around the world have welcomed them, forcibly displaced children and their families often face discrimination, poverty, and social marginalization in their home, transit, and destination countries. Language barriers and legal barriers in transit and destination countries often bar refugee children and their families from accessing education, healthcare, social protection, and other services. Many countries of destination also lack intercultural supports and policies for social integration. Such threats to safety and well-being are amplified for refugee children with disabilities. Additionally, North American schools often don‚Äôt have the resources needed to support refugee children. [103] Refugee children often have to handle discrimination, low socioeconomic status, have no family, or come to a setting that clashes with their cultural beliefs leading to behavioral issues teachers aren‚Äôt always prepared for. [117] Extracurricular resources provided to refugee children include supplementary curriculum enrichment resources, videos for the goal or increasing parent and school awareness, informational leaflets and handbooks, as well as ICT based resources, which serve to benefit refugee involvement in the school. This woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld, 1860 depicts Jesus as a refugee child fleeing the Massacre of the Innocents. ==Legal protection== The Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, includes four articles that are particularly relevant to children involved in or affected by forced displacement:UNICEF. \\"Convention on the Rights of the Child.\\" Child Labor (1989): 8. * the principle of non- discrimination (Article 2) * best interests of the child (Article 3) * right to life and survival and development (Article 6) * the right to child participation (Article 12) States Parties to the Convention are obliged to uphold the above articles, regardless of a child's migration status. As of November 2005, a total of 192 countries have become States Parties to the Convention. Somalia and the United States are the only two countries that have not ratified it. The United Nations 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees is a comprehensive and rigid legal code regarding the rights of refugees at an international level and it also defines under which conditions a person should be considered as a refugee and thus be given these rights.Steinbock, Daniel J. \\"The refugee definition as law: issues of interpretation.\\" Refugee Rights and Realities: Evolving International Concepts and Regimes (1999): 13-39. The Convention provides protection to forcibly displaced persons who have experienced persecution or torture in their home countries. For countries that have ratified it, the Convention often serves as the primary basis for refugee status determination, but some countries also utilize other refugee definitions, thus, have granted refugee status not based exclusively on persecution. For instance, the African Union has agreed on a definition at the 1969 Refugee Convention, that also accommodates people affected by external aggression, occupation, foreign domination, and events seriously disturbing public order.‚ÄúRefugee Status Determination: Identifying Who Is a Refugee.‚Äù 2005. Geneva: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). South Africa has granted refugee status to Mozambicans and Zimbabweans following the collapse of their home countries‚Äô economies.Bloch, Joanne. I am an African: stories of young refugees in South Africa. New Africa Books, 2007. Other international legal tools for the protection refugee children include two of the Protocols supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime which reference child migration: * the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children;UN General Assembly. \\"Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime.\\" GA res 55 (2000): 25. * the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea, and Air.UN General Assembly. \\"Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.\\" (2000). Additionally the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families covers the rights of the children of migrant workers in both regular and irregular situations during the entire migration process. == Stages of the refugee experience == Refugee experiences can be categorized into three stages of migration: home country experiences (pre-migration), transit experiences (transmigration), and host country experiences (post-migration).Hamilton, Richard J., and Dennis Moore, eds. Educational interventions for refugee children: Theoretical perspectives and implementing best practice.

However, the large majority of refugees do not travel into new host countries, but remain in the transmigration stage, living in refugee camps or urban centres waiting to be able to return home. Home country experiences (pre- migration) Former child soldiers in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The pre-migration stage refers to home country experiences leading up to and including the decision to flee. Pre-migration experiences include the challenges and threats children face that drive them to seek refuge in another country.Moore, Will H., and Stephen M. Shellman. \\"Refugee or internally displaced person? To where should one flee?.\\" Comparative Political Studies 39, no. 5 (2006): 599-622. Refugee children migrate, either with their families or unaccompanied, due to fear of persecution on the premise of membership of a particular social group, or due to the threat of forced marriage, forced labor, or conscription into armed forces.Hamilton, Carolyn, Kirsten Anderson, Ruth Barnes, and Kamena Dorling. \\"Administrative detention of children: a global report.\\" Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para la Infancia, Nueva York (2011). Others may leave to escape famine or in order to ensure the safety and security of themselves and their families from the destruction of war or internal conflict.Achvarina, Vera, and Simon F. Reich. \\"No place to hide: Refugees, displaced persons, and the recruitment of child soldiers.\\" International Security 31, no. 1 (2006): 127-164. A 2016 report by UNICEF found that, by the end of 2015, five years of open conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic had forced 4.9 million Syrians out of the country, half of which were children. The same report found that, by the end of 2015, more than ten years of armed conflict in Afghanistan had forced 2.7 million Afghans beyond the country's borders; half of the refugees from Afghanistan were children. During times of war, in addition to being exposed to violence, many children are abducted and forced to become soldiers. According to an estimate, 12,000 refugee children have been recruited into armed groups within South Sudan.Davies, Susanna, and Carol Batchelor. \\"Resettlement as a protection tool for refugee children.\\" Forced Migration Review 54 (2017): 38. War itself often becomes a part of the child's identity, making reintegration difficult once he or she is removed from the unstable environment. Examples of children's pre- migration experiences: * Some Sudanese refugee children reported that they had either experienced personally or witnessed potentially traumatic events prior to departure from their home country, during attacks by the Sudanese military in Darfur. These events include instances of sexual violence, as well as of individuals being beaten, shot, bound, stabbed, strangled, drowned, and kidnapped.Rasmussen, Andrew, Basila Katoni, Allen S. Keller, and John Wilkinson. \\"Posttraumatic idioms of distress among Darfur refugees: Hozun and Majnun.\\" Transcultural Psychiatry 48, no. 4 (2011): 392-415. * Some Burmese refugee children in Australia were found to have undergone severe pre- migration traumas, including the lack of food, water, and shelter, forced separation from family members, murder of family or friends, kidnappings, sexual abuse, and torture.Schweitzer, Robert D., Mark Brough, Lyn Vromans, and Mary Asic-Kobe. \\"Mental health of newly arrived Burmese refugees in Australia: contributions of pre-migration and post-migration experience.\\" Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry 45, no. 4 (2011): 299-307. * In 2014 the President of Honduras testified in front of the United States Congress that more than three-quarters of unaccompanied child migrants from Honduras came from the country's most violent cities.‚ÄúCentral America and Mexico Unaccompanied Child Migration Situation Report No. 1.‚Äù 2014. United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In fact, 58 percent of 404 unaccompanied and separated children interviewed by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, about their journey to the United States indicated that they had been forcibly displaced from their homes because they had either been harmed or were under threat of harm.‚ÄúUnaccompanied Children Leaving Central America and Mexico and the Need for International Protection.‚Äù 2014. Washington, DC: UNHCR. In general, children may also cross borders for economic reasons, such as to escape poverty and social deprivation, or some children may do so to join other family members already settled in another State. But it is the involuntary nature of refugees' departure that distinguishes them from other migrant groups who have not undergone forced displacement.Bemak, Fred, Rita Chi-Ying Chung, and Paul Pedersen. Counseling refugees: A psychosocial approach to innovative multicultural interventions. No. 40. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003. Refugees, and even more so their children, are neither psychologically nor pragmatically prepared for the rapid movement and transition resulting from events outside their control. Any direct or witnessed forms of violence and sexual abuse may characterize refugee children's pre-migration experiences.Schinin√†, Guglielmo, Sonali Sharma, Olga Gorbacheva, and Anit Kumar Mishra. \\"Who am I? Assessment of psychosocial needs and suicide risk factors among Bhutanese refugees in Nepal and after the third country resettlement.\\" International Organization for Migration (IOM) (2011).  Transit experiences (transmigration)  The transmigration period is characterized by the physical relocation of refugees. This process includes the journey between home countries and host countries and often involves time spent in a refugee camp.Bhugra, Dinesh, and Peter Jones. \\"Migration and mental illness.\\" Advances in Psychiatric Treatment 7, no. 3 (2001): 216-222. Children may experience arrest, detention, sexual assault, and torture during their translocation to the host country.Kaplan, Ida. \\"Effects of trauma and the refugee experience on psychological assessment processes and interpretation.\\" Australian Psychologist 44, no. 1 (2009): 6-15. Children, particularly those who travel on their own or become separated from their families, are likely to face various forms of violence and exploitation throughout the transmigration period. The experience of traveling from one country to another is much more difficult for women and children, because they are more vulnerable to assaults and exploitation by people they encounter at the border and in refugee camps.Kira, Ibrahim A., Iris Smith, Linda Lewandowski, and Thomas Templin. \\"The effects of gender discrimination on refugee torture survivors: A cross- cultural traumatology perspective.\\" Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association 16, no. 5 (2010): 299-306.  Trafficking  Smuggling, in which a smuggler illegally moves a migrant into another country, is a pervasive issue for children travelling both with and without their families. While fleeing their country of origin, many unaccompanied children end up travelling with traffickers who may attempt to exploit them as workers. Including adults, sex trafficking is more prevalent in Europe and Central Asia, whereas in East Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific labour trafficking is more prevalent.‚ÄúGlobal Report on Trafficking in Persons 2016.‚Äù Vienna, Austria: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, December 2016. Many unaccompanied children fleeing from conflict zones in Moldova, Romania, Ukraine, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, China, Afghanistan or Sri Lanka are forced into sexual exploitation. Especially vulnerable groups include girls belonging to single-parent households, unaccompanied children, children from child- headed households, orphans, girls who were street traders, and girls whose mothers were street traders. While refugee boys have been identified as the main victims of exploitation in the labor market, refugee girls aged between 13 and 18 have been the main targets of sexual exploitation. In particular, the number of young Nigerian women and girls brought into Italy for exploitation has been increasing: it was reported that 3,529 Nigerian women, among them underage girls, arrived by sea between January and June 2016. Once they reached Italy, these girls worked under conditions of slavery, for periods typically ranging from three to seven years.‚ÄúYoung Invisible Enslaved: The Child Victims at the Heart of Trafficking and Exploitation in Italy.‚Äù Save the Children Italia Onlus, November 2016. https://www.savethechildren.net/sites/default/files/libraries/young%20invisible%20enslaved%204%20low.pdf.  Detention  Children may be detained in prisons, military facilities, immigration detention centers, welfare centers, or educational facilities. While detained, migrant children are deprived of a range of rights, such as the right to physical and mental health, privacy, education, and leisure. And many countries do not have a legal time limit for detention, leaving some children incarcerated for indeterminate time periods.Flynn, Michael. An introduction to data construction on immigration-related detention. Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, 2011. Some children are even detained together with adults and subjected to a harsher, adult-based treatment and regimen. In North Africa, children travelling without legal status are frequently subjected to extended periods of immigration detention. Children held in administrative detention in Palestine only receive a limited amount of education, and those held in interrogation centers receive no education at all. In two of the prisons visited by Defense for Children International Palestine, education was found to be limited to two hours a week. It has also been reported that child administrative detainees in Palestine do not receive sufficient food to meet their daily nutritional requirements. Documented cases of child detention are available for more than 100 countries, ranging from the highest to the lowest income nations. Even so, a growing number of countries, including both Panama and Mexico, prohibit the detention of child migrants.Mitchell, Grant. \\"Engaging Governments on Alternatives to Immigration Detention.\\" Global Detention Project (2016). And Yemen has adopted a community-driven approach, using small-group alternative care homes for child refugees and asylum-seekers, as a more age-appropriate way of detention. In the United States unaccompanied children are placed in single purpose non-secure ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs shelters‚Äù for immigration violations, rather than in juvenile detention facilities. However, this change has not ended the practice of administrative detention entirely.Fazel, Mina, Unni Karunakara, and Elizabeth A. Newnham. \\"Detention, denial, and death: migration hazards for refugee children.\\" The Lancet Global Health 2, no. 6 (2014): e313-e314. Although there is commitment by the Council of Europe to work toward ending the detention of children for migration control purposes, asylum-seeking and migrant children and families often undergo detention experiences that conflict with international commitments.  Refugee camps  Some refugee camps operate at levels below acceptable standards of environmental health; overcrowding and a lack of wastewater networks and sanitation systems are common.Farah, Randa. \\"A report on the psychological effects of overcrowding in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\\" Prepared for the Expert and Advisory Services Fund‚ÄîInternational Development Research Centre, Canada: IDRC (2000).de Bruijn, Bart. The Living Conditions and Well-being of Refugees. No. 19208. University Library of Munich, Germany, 2009.Cronin, A. A., D. Shrestha, N. Cornier, F. Abdalla, N. Ezard, and C. Aramburu. \\"A review of water and sanitation provision in refugee camps in association with selected health and nutrition indicators‚Äìthe need for integrated service provision.\\" Journal of water and health 6, no. 1 (2008): 1-13. Hardships of a refugee camp may also contribute to symptoms following a refugee child's discharge from a camp. A small number of Cuban refugee children and adolescents, who were detained in a refugee camp, were assessed months after their release, and it was found that 57 percent of the youth exhibited moderate to severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.Rothe, Eugenio M., John Lewis, Hector Castillo-Matos, Orestes Martinez, Ruben Busquets, and Igna Martinez. \\"Posttraumatic stress disorder among Cuban children and adolescents after release from a refugee camp.\\" Psychiatric Services 53, no. 8 (2002): 970-976. Unaccompanied girls at refugee camps may also face harassment or assault from camp guards and fellow male refugees.Asaf, Yumna. \\"Syrian Women and the Refugee Crisis: Surviving the Conflict, Building Peace, and Taking New Gender Roles.\\" Social Sciences 6, no. 3 (2017): 110. In addition to having poor infrastructure and limited support services, there are a few refugee camps that can present danger to refugee children and families by housing members of armed forces. Also, at a few refugee camps, militia forces may try to recruit and abduct children. Host country experiences (post-migration) The third stage, host country experiences, is the integration of refugees into the social, political, economic, and cultural framework of the host country society. The post- migration period involves adaptation to a new culture and re-defining one's identity and place in the new society. This stress can be exacerbated when the children arrive in the host country and are expected to adapt quickly to a new setting.Marar, Marianne Maurice. \\"I know there is no justice: Palestinian perceptions of higher education in Jordan.\\" Intercultural Education 22, no. 2 (2011): 177-190. It is only a minority of refugees who travel into new host countries and who are allowed to start a new life there. Most refugees are living in refugee camps or urban centres waiting to be able to return home. For those who are starting a new life in a new country there are two options:  Seeking asylum  Asylum seekers are people who have formally applied for asylum in another country and who are still waiting for a decision on their status.Walker, Sarah. \\"Something to smile about: Promoting and supporting the educational and recreational needs of refugee children.\\" Refugee Council (2011). Once they have received a positive response from the host government, they will legally be considered as refugees. Refugees, like citizens of the host country, have the rights to education, health, and social services, whereas asylum seekers do not.Bhugra, Dinesh. \\"Migration and mental health.\\" Acta psychiatrica scandinavica 109, no. 4 (2004): 243-258. For instance, the majority of refugees and migrants who arrived in Europe in 2015 through mid-2016 were accommodated in overcrowded transit centers and informal settlements, where privacy and access to education and health services were often limited. In some accommodation centers in Germany and Sweden, where asylum seekers stayed until their claims were processed, separate living spaces for women, as well as sex-separated latrines and shower facilities, were unavailable. Unaccompanied children face particular difficulties throughout the asylum process. They are minors who are separated from their families once they reach the host country, or minors who decide to travel from their home countries to a foreign country without a parent or guardian.Meda, Lawrence. 2013. ‚ÄúRefugee Learner Experiences : A Case Study of Zimbabwean Refugee Children.‚Äù Thesis. http://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/handle/10413/12135. More children are traveling alone, with nearly 100,000 unaccompanied children in 2015 filing claims for asylum in 78 countries. Bhabha (2004) argues that it is more challenging for unaccompanied children than adults to gain asylum, as unaccompanied children are usually unable to find appropriate legal representation and stand up for themselves during the application process.Bhabha, Jacqueline. \\"Seeking Asylum Alone: Treatment of separated and trafficked children in need of refugee protection.\\" International migration 42, no. 1 (2004): 141-148. In Australia, for instance, unaccompanied children, who usually do not have any kind of legal assistance, must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that they are in need of the country's protection.Crock, Mary. Seeking asylum alone: A study of Australian law, policy and practice regarding unaccompanied and separated children. Federation Press, 2006. Many children do not have the necessary documents for legal entry into a host country, often avoiding officials due to fear of being caught and deported to their home countries.Elwyn, H., C. Gladwell, and S. Lyall. \\"I Just Want to Study: Access to Higher Education for Young Refugees and Asylum Seekers.\\" London, Refugee Support Network (2012). Without documented status, unaccompanied children often face challenges in acquiring education and healthcare in many countries. These factors make them particularly vulnerable to hunger, homelessness, and sexual and labor exploitation.Vandenhole, Wouter, Ellen Desmet, Didier Reynaert, and Sara Lembrechts, eds. Routledge international handbook of children‚Äôs rights studies. Routledge, 2015. Displaced youth, both male and female, are vulnerable to recruitment into armed groups.Lischer, Sarah Kenyon. \\"War, displacement, and the recruitment of child soldiers.\\" Child Soldiers Initiative Working Group Session Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (2006): 15-16. Unaccompanied children may also resort to dangerous jobs to meet their own survival needs.Bhabha, Jacqueline, and Susan Schmidt. \\"Seeking asylum alone: Unaccompanied and separated children and refugee protection in the US.\\" The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth 1, no. 1 (2008): 126-138.

Refugee resettlement  Third country resettlement refers to the transfer of refugees from the country they have fled to another country that is more suitable to their needs and that has agreed to grant them permanent settlement. Currently the number of places available for resettlement is less than the number needed for children for whom resettlement would be most appropriate. Some nations have prioritized children at risk as a category for resettlement: The United States established its Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program in 1980 to support unaccompanied children for resettlement. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) by the Department of Homeland Security currently works with state and local service providers to provide unaccompanied refugee children with resettlement and foster care services. This service is guaranteed to unaccompanied refugee minors until they reach the age of majority or until they are reunited with their families.Huemer, Julia, Niranjan S. Karnik, Sabine Voelkl-Kernstock, Elisabeth Granditsch, Kanita Dervic, Max H. Friedrich, and Hans Steiner. \\"Mental health issues in unaccompanied refugee minors.\\" Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health 3, no. 1 (2009): 13. Some European nations have established programs to support the resettlement and integration of refugee children. The European countries admitting the most refugee children in 2016 via resettlement were the United Kingdom (2,525 refugee children), Norway (1,930), Sweden (915), and Germany (595). Together, these accounted for 66% of the child resettlement admissions to all of Europe.‚ÄúRefugee and Migrant Children in Europe: Accompanied, Unaccompanied, and Separated (Quarterly Overview of Trends: January - March 2017).‚Äù UNHCR, UNICEF, IOM, 2017. https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/download/58431. The United Kingdom also established a new initiative in 2016 to support the resettlement of vulnerable refugee children from the Middle East and North Africa, regardless of family separation status. It was reported in February 2017 that this program has been partially suspended by the government; the program would no longer accept refugee youth with \\"complex needs,\\" such as those with disabilities, until further notice.Agerholm, Harriet. \\"Disabled child refugees entry to UK through resettlement scheme suspended by Home Office.\\" The Independent. February 09, 2017. Accessed December 05, 2017. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home- news/disabled-child-refugees-uk-suspend-entry-home-office-resettlement-unhcr- united-nations-lord-dubs-a7571451.html. Refugee children without caretakers have a greater risk of exhibiting psychiatric symptoms of mental illnesses following traumatic stress. Unaccompanied refugee children display more behavioral problems and emotional distress than refugee children with caretakers. Parental well-being plays a crucial role in enabling resettled refugees to transition into a new society. If a child is separated from his/her caretakers during the process of resettlement, the likelihood that he/she will develop a mental illness increases. ==Health== This section covers health throughout the different stages of the refugee experience.  Health status   Nutrition  Refugee children arriving in the United States often come from countries with a high prevalence of undernutrition.Lutfy, Caitlyn, Susan T. Cookson, Leisel Talley, and Roger Rochat. \\"Malnourished children in refugee camps and lack of connection with services after US resettlement.\\" Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health 16, no. 5 (2014): 1016-1022. Nearly half of a sample of refugee children who arrived to the American state of Washington, the majority of which were from Iraq, Somalia, and Burma, were found to have at least one form of malnutrition. In the under five age range refugee children had significantly higher rates of wasting syndrome and stunted growth, as well as a lower prevalence of obesity, in comparison to low-income non-refugee children.Dawson-Hahn, Elizabeth E., Suzinne Pak-Gorstein, Andrea J. Hoopes, and Jasmine Matheson. \\"Comparison of the nutritional status of overseas refugee children with low income children in Washington state.\\" PLOS One 11, no. 1 (2016): e0147854. However, some time after they arrived in the United States and Australia, many refugee children demonstrated an increasing rate of overnutrition. An Australian study, assessing the nutritional status of 337 sub-Saharan African children aged between three and 12 years, found that the prevalence rate for overweight amongst refugee children was 18.4%.Renzaho, Andre, Carl Gibbons, Boyd Swinburn, Damien Jolley, and Catherine Burns. \\"Obesity and undernutrition in sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee children in Victoria, Australia.\\" PhD diss., Healthy Eating Club, 2006. The prevalence rate of overweight and obesity among refugee children in Rhode Island, increased from 17.3% at initial measurement at first arrival to 35.4% at measurement three years after.Heney, Jessica H., Camia C. Dimock, Jennifer F. Friedman, and C. Lewis. \\"Pediatric refugees in Rhode Island: increases in BMI percentile, overweight, and obesity following resettlement.\\" RI Med J 98, no. 1 (2015): 43-7. But the nutritional profiles of refugee children also often vary by their country of origin. A study involving Syrian refugee children in Jordanian refugee camps found them to be on average more likely overweight than acutely malnourished. The low prevalence of acute malnutrition among them was attributed, at least partly, to UNICEF's infant and child feeding interventions, as well as to the distribution of food vouchers by the World Food Programme (WFP).Bilukha, Oleg O., Douglas Jayasekaran, Ann Burton, Gabriele Faender, James King'ori, Mohammad Amiri, Dorte Jessen, and Eva Leidman. \\"Nutritional Status of Women and Child Refugees from Syria‚ÄîJordan, April‚ÄìMay 2014.\\" MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 63, no. 29 (2014): 638-9. Among newly arrived refugees in Washington state, significantly higher rates of obesity were observed among Iraqi children, whereas higher rates of stunting were found among Burmese and Somali children. The latter also had higher rates of wasting. Such variation in the nutrition profiles of refugee children may be explained by the variance in refugees' location and time in transition.Yun, Katherine, Jasmine Matheson, Colleen Payton, Kevin C. Scott, Barbara L. Stone, Lihai Song, William M. Stauffer, Kailey Urban, Janine Young, and Blain Mamo. \\"Health profiles of newly arrived refugee children in the United States, 2006‚Äì2012.\\" American journal of public health 106, no. 1 (2016): 128-135.  Communicable diseases  Communicable diseases are a pervasive issue faced by refugee children in camps and other temporary settlements. Governments and organizations are working to address a number of them, such as measles, rubella, diarrhea, and cholera. Refugee children often arrive in the United States from countries with a high prevalence of infectious disease. Measles has been a major cause of child deaths in refugee camps and among internally displaced people; measles also exacerbates malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency.Toole, Michael J., and Ronald J. Waldman. \\"The public health aspects of complex emergencies and refugee situations.\\" Annual review of public health 18, no. 1 (1997): 283-312.Toole, Michael J., Richard W. Steketee, Ronald J. Waldman, and Phillip Nieburg. \\"Measles prevention and control in emergency settings.\\" Bulletin of the World Health Organization 67, no. 4 (1989): 381. Some countries, such as Kenya, have developed preventive, detective, and curative programs to specifically target measles within the refugee children population. Kenya has reached over 20 million children with a measles and rubella immunization campaign carried out at the national level in May 2016. In 2017 the Kenya Ministry of Health even reported a routine vaccination coverage of 95 percent in the Dadaab refugee camp. As of April 2017, in response to the first confirmed cases of measles in the camp, UNICEF and UNHCR have collaborated with the Kenya Ministry of Health to swiftly implement an integrated measles vaccination program in Dadaab. The campaign, which has been targeting children aged six to 14 years, also includes screening, treatment referrals for cases of malnutrition, vitamin A supplementation, and deworming. Diarrhea, acute watery diarrhea, and cholera can also put children's lives at risk. Countries, such as Bangladesh, have identified the introduction and development of proper sanitation habits and facilities as potential solutions to these medical conditions. A 2008 study comparing refugee camps in Bangladesh reported that camps with sanitation facilities had cholera rates of 16%, whereas camps without such facilities had cholera rates that were almost three times higher. In a single week in 2017, 5,011 cases of diarrhea in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh were reported. In response, UNICEF started a year-long cholera vaccination campaign in October 2017, targeting all children in the camps. At health centers in the refugee camps, UNICEF has been screening for potential cholera cases and providing oral rehydration salts. Community-based health workers are also going around the camps to share information on the risks of acute watery diarrhea, the cholera vaccination campaign, and the importance and necessity of good hygiene practices.  Noncommunicable diseases  During all points of the refugee experience, refugee children are often at risk of developing several noncommunicable diseases and conditions, such as lead poisoning, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and pediatric cancer. Many refugee children come to their host countries with elevated blood lead levels; others encounter lead hazards once they have resettled. A study published in January 2013 found that the blood lead levels of refugee children who had just arrived to the state of New Hampshire were more than twice as likely to be above 10 ¬µg/dL as the blood lead levels of children born in the United States.Raymond, Jaime S., Chinaro Kennedy, and Mary Jean Brown. \\"Blood lead level analysis among refugee children resettled in New Hampshire and Rhode Island.\\" Public Health Nursing 30, no. 1 (2013): 70-79. Evidence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States also found that nearly 30% of 242 refugee children in New Hampshire developed elevated blood lead levels within three to six months of their arrival to the United States, even though their levels were not found to be elevated at initial screening.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC. \\"Elevated blood lead levels in refugee children--New Hampshire, 2003-2004.\\" MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 54, no. 2 (2005): 42. A more recent study reported that refugee children in Massachusetts were 12 times more likely to have blood lead levels over 20 ¬µg/dL a year after an initial screening than non-refugee children of the same age and living in the same communities.Eisenberg, Katherine W., Edwin van Wijngaarden, Susan G. Fisher, Katrina S. Korfmacher, James R. Campbell, I. Diana Fernandez, Jennifer Cochran, and Paul L. Geltman. \\"Blood lead levels of refugee children resettled in Massachusetts, 2000 to 2007.\\" American journal of public health 101, no. 1 (2011): 48-54. A study analyzing the medical records of former refugees residing in Rochester, New York between 1980 and 2012 demonstrated that former child refugees may be at increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension following resettlement.Golub, Natalia. \\"Longitudinal Health Outcomes in Former Refugees.\\" PhD diss., University of Rochester, 2014. Many Afghan children lack access to urban diagnosis centers in Pakistan; those who do have access have been found to have various types of cancer.Khan, Sher Mohammad, Jawad Gillani, Shagufta Nasreen, and Salar Zai. \\"Pediatric tumors in north west Pakistan and Afghan refugees.\\" Pediatric hematology and oncology 14, no. 3 (1997): 267-272. It is also estimated that, within Turkey's Syrian refugee population, 60 to 100 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Overall, the incidence rate of pediatric cancers among Turkey's Syrian refugee population was similar to that of Turkish children. The study additionally noted, however, that most refugee children affected by cancer were diagnosed when the tumor was already at an advanced stage. This could indicate that refugee children and their families often face obstacles such as poor prognoses, language barriers, financial problems, and social problems in adapting to a new setting.Kebudi, Rejin, Ibrahim Bayram, Begul Yagci-Kupeli, Serhan Kupeli, Gulay Sezgin, Esra Pekpak, Yesim Oymak et al. \\"Refugee children with cancer in Turkey.\\" The Lancet Oncology 17, no. 7 (2016): 865-867.  Mental health and illness  Traditionally, the mental health of children experiencing conflict is understood in terms of either post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or toxic stress.Thabet, A.A. and P. Vostanis, Post-traumatic stress reactions in children of war. J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 1999. 40(3): p. 385-91. Prolonged and constant exposure to stress and uncertainty, characteristic of a war environment may result in toxic stress that children express with a change in behavior that may include anxiety, self-harm, aggressiveness or suicide.SavetheChildren, Invisible Wounds: The impact of six years of war on the mental health of Syrian children. 2017. A 2017 study conducted in Syria by Save the Children determined that 84% of all adults and most children considered ongoing bombing and shelling to be the main psychological stressor, while 89% said that children were more fearful as the war progressed, and 80% said that children had become more aggressive. These stressors are leading causes of the symptoms described above, which lead to diagnosis of PTSD and toxic stress, among other mental conditions. These issues may then be further exacerbated by a forced migration to a foreign country, and the beginning of the process of refugee status determination. A review of refugee children in high-income countries showed PTSD prevalence ranging from 19 ‚Äì 54%, with an average prevalence of 36%. Refugee children are extremely vulnerable during migration and resettlement, and may experience long-term pathological effects, due to \\"disrupted development time.\\" Psychoanalysts of refugee health have proposed that refugee children experience mourning for their culture and countries, despite the fact that the war-torn state of their homes is unsafe. This sudden loss of familiarity places children at a greater risk for mental dysfunction. In addition, studies have shown that refugee children show a higher vulnerability to stress when separated from their families. Studies from treatment facilities and small community samples have confirmed that refugee youth are at higher risk for psychopathologic disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and problems resulting from substance abuse. Refugee children living in high-income countries have a prevalence of depression of 3 - 30%, with an average prevalence of 18%. However, other large-scale community surveys have found that the rate of psychiatric disorder among immigrant youth is not higher than that of native-born children.Betancourt, Theresa Stichick, and Kashif Tanveer Khan. \\"The mental health of children affected by armed conflict: protective processes and pathways to resilience.\\" International review of psychiatry 20, no. 3 (2008): 317-328.Rousseau, C√©cile, Aline Drapeau, and Sadeq Rahimi. \\"The complexity of trauma response: a 4-year follow-up of adolescent Cambodian refugees.\\" Child abuse & neglect 27, no. 11 (2003): 1277-1290. Nonetheless, experiments have shown that these adverse outcomes can be prevented through adequate protective factors, such as social support and intimacy.Eisenbruch, Maurice. ‚ÄúThe Mental Health of Refugee Children and Their Cultural Development.‚Äù The International Migration Review, vol. 22, no. 2, 1988, pp. 282‚Äì300. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2546651. Additionally, effective adaptation strategies, such as absorption in work and creation of pseudofamilies, have led to successful coping in refugees. Many refugee populations, particularly Southeast Asian, undergo a secondary migration to larger communities of kinfolk from their countries of origin, which serve as social support networks for refugees. Research has shown that family reunification, formation of new social groups, community groups, and social services and professional support have contributed to successful resettlement of refugees. Refugees can be stigmatized if they encounter mental health deficiencies prior to and during their resettlement into a new society. Differences between parental and host country values can create a rift between the refugee child and his/her new society. Less exposure to stigmatization lowers the risk of refugee children developing PTSD. Access to healthcare Cognitive and structural barriers make it difficult to determine the medical service utilization rates and patterns of refugee children. A better understanding of these barriers will help improve mental healthcare access for refugee children and their families.  Cognitive and emotional barriers  Many refugees develop a mistrust of authority figures due to repressive governments in their country of origin. Fear of authority and a lack of awareness regarding mental health issues prevent refugee children and their families from seeking medical help. Certain cultures use informal support systems and self-care strategies to cope with their mental illnesses, rather than rely upon biomedicine. Language and cultural differences also complicate a refugee's understanding of mental illness and available healthcare. Other factors that delay refugees from seeking medical help are: * Fear of discrimination and stigmatization * Denial of mental illness as defined in the Western context * Fear of the unknown consequences following diagnosis such as deportation, separation from family, and losing children * Mistrust of Western biomedicine Language barriers A broad spectrum of translation services are available to all refugees, but only a small number of those services are government-sponsored. Community health organizations provide a majority of translation services, but there are a shortage of funds and available programs. Since children and adolescents have a greater capacity to adopt their host country's language and cultural practices, they are often used as linguistic intermediaries between service providers and their parents. This may result in increased tension in family dynamics where culturally sensitive roles are reversed. Traditional family dynamics in refugee families disturbed by cultural adaptation tend to destabilize important cultural norms, which can create a rift between parent and child. These difficulties cause an increase of depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns in culturally-adapted adolescent refugees. Relying on other family members or community members has equally problematic results where relatives and community members unintentionally exclude or include details relevant to comprehensive care. Healthcare practitioners are also hesitant to rely on members of the community because it is breaches confidentiality. A third party present also reduces the willingness of refugees to trust their healthcare practitioners and disclose information. Patients may receive a different translator for each of their follow-up appointments with their mental healthcare providers, which means that refugees need to recount their story via multiple interpreters, further compromising confidentiality. Culturally competent care Culturally competent care exists when healthcare providers have received specialized training that helps them to identify the actual and potential cultural factors informing their interactions with refugee patients. Culturally competent care tends to prioritize the social and cultural determinants contributing to health, but the traditional Western biomedical model of care often fails to acknowledge these determinants. To provide culturally competent care to refugees, mental healthcare providers should demonstrate some understanding of the patient's background, and a sensitive commitment to relevant cultural manners (for example: privacy, gender dynamics, religious customs, and lack of language skills). The willingness of refugees to access mental healthcare services rests on the degree of cultural sensitivity within the structure of their service provider. The protective influence exercised by adult refugees on their child and adolescent dependents makes it unlikely that young adult- accompanied refugees will access mental healthcare services. Only 10-30 percent of youth in the general population, with a need for mental healthcare services, are currently accessing care. Adolescent ethnic minorities are less likely to access mental healthcare services than youth in the dominant cultural group. Parents, caretakers and teachers are more likely to report an adolescent's need for help, and seek help resources, than the adolescent. Unaccompanied refugee minors are less likely to access mental healthcare services than their accompanied counterparts. Internalizing complaints (such as depression and anxiety) are prevalent forms of psychological distress among refugee children and adolescents. Other obstacles Additional structural deterrents for refugees: * Complicated insurance policies based on refugee status (e.g. Government Assistant Refugees vs. Non-), resulting in hidden costs for refugee patients According to the United States Office of Refugee Resettlement, an insurance called refugee Medical Assistance is available in the short term (up to 8 months), while other such as Medicaid and CHIP are available for several years. * Lack of transportation * A lack of public awareness and access to information about available resources * An unfamiliarity with the host country's healthcare system, amplified by a shortage of government or community intervention in settlement services Structural deterrents for healthcare professionals: * Heightened instances of mental health complications in refugee populations * A lack of documented medical history, which makes comprehensive care difficult * Time constraints: medical appointments are restricted to a small window of opportunity, making it difficult to connect and provide mental healthcare for refugees * Complicated insurance plans, resulting in a delay in compensation for the healthcare provider  Health education  The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) and Family Health International (FHI) have designed and piloted a peer-centered education program for adolescent refugee girls in Uganda, Zambia, and Egypt. The goal of the program was to reach young women who were interested in being informed about reproductive health issues. The program was split into three age-specific groups: girls aged seven to 10 learned about bodily changes and anatomy; girls aged 11 to 14 learned about sexually transmitted diseases; girls aged 15 and older focused on tips to ensure a healthy pregnancy and to properly care for a baby. According to qualitative surveys, increased self-esteem and greater use of health services among the program's participants were the largest benefits of the program.Speizer, Ilene S., Robert J. Magnani, and Charlotte E. Colvin. \\"The effectiveness of adolescent reproductive health interventions in developing countries: a review of the evidence.\\" Journal of Adolescent Health 33, no. 5 (2003): 324-348. ==Education== This section covers education throughout the different stages of the refugee experience. The report, \\"Left Behind: Refugee Education in Crisis,\\" compares UNHCR sources and statistics on refugee education with data on school enrollment around the world provided by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The report notes that, globally, 91 percent of children attend primary school. For all refugees, that figure is at 61 percent. Specifically in low-income countries, less than 50 percent of refugees are able to attend primary school. As refugee children get older, school enrollment rates drop: only 23 percent of refugee adolescents are enrolled in secondary school, versus the global figure of 84 percent. In low-income countries, nine percent of refugees are able to go to secondary school. Across the world, enrollment in tertiary education stands at 36 percent. For refugees, the percentage remains at one percent.‚ÄúLeft Behind: Refugee Education in Crisis.‚Äù Geneva, Switzerland: UNHCR, September 12, 2017. http://www.unhcr.org/59b696f44.pdf. Adapting to a new school environment is a major undertaking for refugee children who arrive in a new country or refugee camp. Education is crucial for the sufficient psychosocial adjustment and cognitive growth of refugee children. Due to these circumstances, it is important that educators consider the needs, obstacles, and successful educational pathways for children refugees. Graham, Minhas, and Paxton (2016) note in their study that parents' misunderstandings about educational styles, teachers' low expectations and stereotyping tendencies, bullying and racial discrimination, pre-migration and post-migration trauma, and forced detention can all be risk factors for learning problems in refugee children. They also note that high academic and life ambition, parents' involvement in education, a supportive home and school environment, teachers' understanding of linguistic and cultural heritage, and healthy peer relationships can all contribute to a refugee child's success in school.Graham, Hamish R., Ripudaman S. Minhas, and Georgia Paxton. \\"Learning problems in children of refugee background: a systematic review.\\" Pediatrics 137, no. 6 (2016): e20153994. While the initial purpose of refugee education was to prepare students to return to their home countries, now the focus of American refugee education is on integration. Access to education Structure of the education system Schools in North America lack the necessary resources for supporting refugee children, particularly in negotiating their academic experience and in addressing the diverse learning needs of refugee children. Complex schooling policies that vary by classroom, building and district, and procedures that require written communication or parent involvement intimidate the parents of refugee children. Educators in North America typically guess the grade in which refugee children should be placed because there is not a standard test or formal interview process required of refugee children. Sahrawi refugee children learning Arabic and Spanish, math, reading and writing, and science subjects. The ability to enroll in school and continue one's studies in developing countries is limited and uneven across regions and settings of displacement, particularly for young girls and at the secondary levels. The availability of sufficient classrooms and teachers is low and many discriminatory policies and practices prohibit refugee children from attending school. Educational policies promoting age- caps can also be harmful to refugee children. Many refugee children face legal restrictions to schooling, even in countries of first asylum. This is the case especially for countries that have not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol.Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. \\"Refugee education in countries of first asylum: Breaking open the black box of pre-resettlement experiences.\\" Theory and Research in Education 14, no. 2 (2016): 131-148. The 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol both emphasize the right to education for refugees, articulating the definition of refugeehood in international contexts. Nevertheless, refugee students have one of the lowest rates of access to education. The UNHCR reported in 2014 that about 50 percent of refugee children had access to education compared to children globally at 93 percent. In countries where they lack official refugee status, refugee children are unable to enroll in national schools.Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. \\"The educational experiences of refugee children in countries of first asylum.\\" Migration Policy Institute (2015). In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, unregistered refugee children described being hesitant to go to school, due to risk of encountering legal authorities at school or while on the way to and from school.  Structure of classes  Student-teacher ratios are very high in most refugee schools, and in some countries, these ratios are nearly twice the UNCHR guideline of 40:1. Although global policies and standards for refugee settings endorse child-centered teaching methods that promote student participation,Dryden-Peterson, Sarah. Refugee education: A global review. UNCHR, 2011. teacher-centered instruction often predominates in refugee classrooms. Teachers lecture for the majority of the time, offering few opportunities for students to ask questions or engage in creative thinking. In eight refugee-serving schools in Kenya, for example, lecturing was the primary mode of instruction.Mendenhall, Mary, Sarah Dryden-Peterson, Lesley Bartlett, Caroline Ndirangu, Rosemary Imonje, Daniel Gakunga, and M. Tangelder. \\"Quality education for refugees in Kenya: Pedagogy in urban Nairobi and Kakuma refugee camp settings.\\" Journal on Education in Emergencies 1, no. 1 (2015): 92-130. In order to address the lack of attention to refugee education in national school systems, the UNHCR developed formal relationships with twenty national ministries of education in 2016 to oversee the political commitment to refugee education at the nation-state level. The UNCHR introduced an adaptive global strategy for refugee education with the aim of \\"integration of refugee learners within national system where possible and appropriate and as guided by ongoing consultation with refugees\\". Residence Refugee children who live in large urban centers in North America have a higher rate of success at school, particularly because their families have greater access to additional social services that can help address their specific needs. Families who are unable to move to urban centers are at a disadvantage. Children with unpredictable migration trajectories suffer most from a lack of schooling because of a lack of uniform schooling in each of their destinations before settling. Language barriers and ethnicity Acculturation stress occurs in North America when families expect refugee youth to remain loyal to ethnic values while mastering the host culture in school and social activities. In response to this demand, children may over-identify with their host culture, their culture of origin, or become marginalized from both. Insufficient communication due to language and cultural barriers may evoke a sense of alienation or \\"being the other\\" in a new society. The clash between cultural values of the family and popular culture in mainstream Western society leads to the alienation of refugee children from their home culture. Many Western schools do not address diversity among ethnic groups from the same nation or provide resources for specific needs of different cultures (such as including halal food in the school menu). Without successfully negotiating cultural differences in the classroom, refugee children experience social exclusion in their new host culture. The presence of racial and ethnic discrimination can have an adverse effect on the well-being of certain groups of children and lead to a reduction in their overall school performance. For instance, cultural differences place Vietnamese refugee youth at a higher risk of pursuing disruptive behaviour. Contemporary Vietnamese American adolescents are prone to greater uncertainties, self-doubts and emotional difficulties than other American adolescents. Vietnamese children are less likely to say they have much to be proud of, that they like themselves as they are, that they have many good qualities, and that they feel socially accepted. Classes for refugees, more often than not, are taught in the host-country language. Refugees in the same classroom may also speak several different languages, requiring multiple interpretations; this can slow the pace of overall instruction. Refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo living in Uganda, for example, had to transition from French to English. Some of these children were placed in lower-level classes due to their lack of English proficiency. Many older children therefore had to repeat lower-level classes, even if they had already mastered the content. Using the language of one ethnic group as the instructional language may threaten the identity of a minority group.Pherali, Tejendra, and Dean Garratt. \\"Post-conflict identity crisis in Nepal: Implications for educational reforms.\\" International Journal of Educational Development 34 (2014): 42-50. The content of the curriculum can also act as a form of discrimination against refugee children involved in the education systems of first asylum countries.Bush, Kenneth David, and Diana Saltarelli. \\"The two faces of education in ethnic conflict.\\" (2000). Curricula often seem foreign and difficult to understand to refugees who are attending national schools alongside host-country nationals. For instance, in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, children described having a hard time understanding concepts that lacked relevance to their lived experiences, especially concepts related to Kenyan history and geography. Similarly, in Uganda, refugee children from the Democratic Republic of Congo studying together with Ugandan children in government schools did not have opportunities in the curriculum to learn the history of their home country. The teaching of one-sided narratives, such as during history lessons, can also threaten the identity of students belonging to minority groups.UNESCO. The hidden crisis: Armed conflict and education. UNESCO, 2011.Vietnamese refugee mother and children at a kindergarten in upper Afula, 1979. Other obstacles Although high- quality education helps refugee children feel safe in the present and enable them to be productive in the future, some do not find success in school. Other obstacles may include: *Disrupted schooling - refugee children may experience disruptive schooling in their country of origin, or they may receive no form of education at all. It is extremely difficult for a student with no previous education to enter a school full of educated children. * Trauma - can impede the ability to learn and cause fear of people in positions of authority (such as teachers and principals) * School drop outs - due to self-perceptions of academic ability, antisocial behaviour, rejection from peers and/or a lack of educational preparation prior to entering the host-country school. School drop outs may also be caused by unsafe school conditions, poverty, etc. * Parents - when parental involvement and support are lacking, a child's academic success decreases substantially. Refugee parents are often unable to help their children with homework due to language barriers. Parents often do not understand the concept of parent-teacher meetings and/or never expect to be a part of their child's education due to pre-existing cultural beliefs. * Assimilation - a refugee child's attempt to quickly assimilate into the culture of their school can cause alienation from their parents and country of origin and create barriers and tension between the parent and child. * Social and individual rejection - hostile discrimination can cause additional trauma when refugee children and treated cruelly by their peers * Identity confusion * Behavioral issues - caused by the adjustment issues and survival behaviours learned in refugee camps Role of teachers North American schools are agents of acculturation, helping refugee children integrate into Western society. Successful educators help children process trauma they may have experienced in their country of origin while supporting their academic adjustment. Refugee children benefit from established and encouraged communication between student and teacher, and also between different students in the classroom. Familiarity with sign language and basic ESL strategies improves communication between teachers and refugee children. Also, non- refugee peers need access to literature that helps educate them on their refugee classmates experiences. Course materials should be appropriate for the specific learning needs of refugee children and provide for a wide range of skills in order to give refugee children strong academic support. Educators should spend time with refugee families discussing previous experiences of the child in order to place the refugee child in the correct grade level and to provide any necessary accommodations School policies, expectations, and parent's rights should be translated into the parent's native language since many parents do not speak English proficiently. Educators need to understand the multiple demands placed on parents (such as work and family care) and be prepared to offer flexibility in meeting times with these families. A booklet published in 2000 written by Dr. Sheila and Dr. Dick detailed the ways teachers can approach refugee children in school as well as the common problems refugee children present with at school. According to the booklet, refugees can come from traumatizing situations and thus may struggle with school attendance, literacy, and their cultural identity. The problems are said to present themselves as anger, withdrawal, issues with authority, concentration, rules, and other inappropriate behavior. The booklet suggests that teachers address those issues by helping children manage their behavior and emotions. According to Dr. Sheila and Dr. Dick, teachers can do so by knowing what the children need, being supportive, and turning them to specialists if need be. According to a study by Dr. Strekalova, teachers in the United States often have little experience with the trauma that refugees often face. The study focuses on how teachers can educate themselves on their students‚Äô situations. The study encourages teachers to be aware of common behavioral problems that refugee children may exhibit in the classroom like anger, withdrawal, rule testing, problems with authority, inability to concentrate, inappropriate behavior, lower academic achievement. The study also notes how refugee children often exhibit this behavior because they are put into a different cultural context, face discrimination, live with families in low socioeconomic circumstances, have no family, and/or have conflicts with their traditional cultural beliefs. According to the study, teachers who understand these barriers refugee children face and thus the inappropriate behavior they may exhibit can help their students have a more positive school experience. Academic adjustment of refugee children Syrian refugee children attend a lesson in a UNICEF temporary classroom in northern Lebanon, July 2014 Teachers can make the transition to a new school easier for refugee children by providing interpreters. Schools meet the psychosocial needs of children affected by war or displacement through programs that provide children with avenues for emotional expression, personal support, and opportunities to enhance their understanding of their past experience. Refugee children benefit from a case-by-case approach to learning, because every child has had a different experience during their resettlement. Communities where the refugee populations are bigger should work with the schools to initiate after school, summer school, or weekend clubs that give the children more opportunities to adjust to their new educational setting. Bicultural integration is the most effective mode of acculturation for refugee adolescents in North America. The staff of the school must understand students in a community context and respect cultural differences. Parental support, refugee peer support, and welcoming refugee youth centers are successful in keeping refugee children in school for longer periods of time. Education about the refugee experience in North America also helps teachers relate better with refugee children and understand the traumas and issues a refugee child may have experienced. Refugee children thrive in classroom environments where all students are valued. A sense of belonging, as well as ability to flourish and become part of the new host society, are factors predicting the well-being of refugee children in academics. Increased school involvement and social interaction with other students help refugee children combat depression and/or other underlying mental health concerns that emerge during the post-migration period. A 2016 study conducted by Dr.Thomas found that education helps refugee children feel socially included within their new culture. For example, Dr. Thomas noted that education often provided a sense of stability as well as support in developing language, cultural, and technical skills.  Peace education  Implemented by UNICEF from 2012 to 2016 and funded by the Government of the Netherlands, Peacebuilding, Education, and Advocacy (PBEA) was a program that tested innovative education solutions to achieve peacebuilding results.Affolter, Friedrich W. \\"Indicators for Education for Peacebuilding in Fragile States UNICEF‚Äôs Peacebuilding, Education and Advocacy Program.\\" The PBEA program in Kenya's Dadaab refugee camp aimed to strengthen resilience and social cohesion in the camp, as well as between refugees and the host community. The initiative was composed of two parts: the Peace Education Programme (PEP), an in-school program taught in Dadaab's primary schools, and the Sports for Development and Peace (SDP) program for refugee adolescents and youth. There was anecdotal evidence of increased levels of social cohesion from participation in PEP and potential resilience from participation in SDP. Peace education for refugee children may also have limitations and its share of opponents. Although peace education from past programs involving non-refugee populations reported to have had positive effects,Arnon, Michal, and Yair Galily. \\"Monitoring the effects of an education for peace program: An Israeli perspective.\\" Human Affairs 24, no. 4 (2014): 531-544.Levy, Gal. \\"Is there a place for peace education? Political education and citizenship activism in Israeli schools.\\" Journal of Peace Education 11, no. 1 (2014): 101-119. studies have found that the attitudes of parents and teachers can also have a strong influence on students' internalization of peace values.Yahya, Siham, Zvi Bekerman, Shifra Sagy, and Simon Boag. \\"When education meets conflict: Palestinian and Jewish-Israeli parental attitudes towards peace promoting education.\\" Journal of Peace Education 9, no. 3 (2012): 297-320. Teachers from Cyprus also resisted a peace education program initiated by the government.Zembylas, Michalinos, Panayiota Charalambous, and Constadina Charalambous. \\"Manifestations of Greek-Cypriot teachers' discomfort toward a peace education initiative: Engaging with discomfort pedagogically.\\" Teaching and Teacher Education 28, no. 8 (2012): 1071-1082. Another study found that, while teachers supported the prospect of reconciliation, ideological and practical concerns made them uncertain about the effective implementation of a peace education program.Zembylas, Michalinos, Constadina Charalambous, Panayiota Charalambous, and Panayiota Kendeou. \\"Promoting peaceful coexistence in conflict-ridden Cyprus: Teachers‚Äô difficulties and emotions towards a new policy initiative.\\" Teaching and Teacher Education 27, no. 2 (2011): 332-341.  Pedagogical Approaches  Refugees fall into a unique situation where the nation-state may not adequately address their educational needs, and the international relief system is tasked with the role of a \\"pseudo-state\\" in developing a curriculum and pedagogical approach. Critical pedagogical approaches to refugee education address the phenomenon of alienation that migrant students face in schools outside of their home countries, where the positioning of English language teachers and their students create power dynamics emphasizing the inadequacies of foreign-language speakers, intensified by the use of compensatory programs to cater to 'at-risk' students. In order to adequately address state-less migrant populations, curricula has to be relevant to the experiences of transnational youth. Pedagogical researchers and policy makers can benefit from lessons learned through participatory action research in refugee camps, where student cited decreased self-esteem associated with a lack of education. == Extracurricular Resources == Haitian refugee children playing in the playground after school An interventional study conducted by Dr. Kendall in California documented that the main resources provided to refugee children and their families fall under these categories: supplementary classroom material, curriculum enrichment resources, videos for the goal or increasing parent and school awareness, informational leaflets and handbooks, as well as ICT based resources. The study also found that extracurricular activities provided by Los Angeles schools enhanced refugee student involvement in school life by reducing isolation. Out of school activities provided by the school included after school study programs that included clubs for homework, revision sessions, exam preparation, and coursework completion. According to the study, the extracurricular language, academic, and social development support provided by the school yielded improvements in the refugee children who attended. The study demonstrated that school staff could also support refugees by raising awareness of refugee culture. For example, some schools in Los Angeles arranged celebrations, assemblies, and cultivated a school environment that actively involved the different cultures, languages and backgrounds of the refugees. The study concluded that the actions of the school had an overall positive effect on the attitudes and empathy of refugee children. Additionally, an anthropological paper found that participation in after school programs lead to increased self concept, high school achievements, educational aspirations and interpersonal competence. As vulnerable populations, marginalized by language, ethnicity, religion and class, refugees can find support in community based organizations as stated by that paper. According to a study by Dr. Roxas, refugees often don't have access to school programs that can meet their unique academic, developmental, and social needs; thus, their integration into public schools becomes difficult due to language, trauma, and lack of counseling and extra academic services. One extracurricular program that the study detailed involved bringing in local community members to interact with the refugee children for the purpose of exposing them to the real world. According to the study, the program offers a means for refugee children to receive support from community members while also learning about the different types of communities. A 2008 study by Dr. Kanu describes the school environment as a microsystem important to the acculturation of refugee children. The study states that the inclusivity of schools can be improved by increasing the cultural basis of recreational support, more diverse cafeteria food, and prayer rooms for Muslim students. In addition, teachers are encouraged to undergo training to increase knowledge on refugees and thus adapt their curricula for this group's benefit. Dr. Pastoor's 2016 research article also detailed the benefits of activities beyond school that may benefit refugee learning and social inclusion. For example, community wide collaboration between the school and surrounding organizations can help refugee students achieve their full potential. Dr. Wellman's and Dr. Bey's research in art education found that visual arts may help refugee students find their own role in and out of school through collaborations between museums, schools, and art exhibitions. Dr. Brunick's paper also found that art served as a valuable extracurricular tool for refugees to reconcile with psychological trauma. According to Dr. O‚ÄôShea's 2000 article, inside the school but outside of the curriculum, school based mental health services have been shown to reduce SDQ scores and dramatic positive implications to those exposed to SES and traumatic adversities. The study conducted by Dr. Thomas recommended training for school social workers to help refugee children manage stress and trauma. Dr. Daniel's 2018 article found that refugee children can themselves use translanguaging and social media to themselves complete their school work which teachers and educators can build upon to help teens with this multifaceted work. A 2017 research paper also found that refugee children express their individuality and culture through drawings, think-aloud techniques, and Acculturation, Habits, and Interests Multicultural Scale for Adolescent instrument in order them to cope with their transitions and express their culture. A research paper focused on policies put in place for refugees in the school system indicated that refugees in Jordan often face institutional discrimination where they don‚Äôt have the same access to extracurricular activities. According to the paper, funding for refugee education often comes from an emergency fund leading to a lack in long term-planning, which can lead to refugees being educated in separate schools and informal community based schools. Iran has a policy including refugees into their education system allowing refugees to join in the same extracurricular programs. As for extracurricular participation, a 2016 publication noted that refugee children often have similar amounts of participation in most extracurricular school activities; however, they are less likely to participate in after school sports activities, attend day care, and participate in a parent-child conference. A 2011 review noted that schools alone do not provide enough support for refugees and their cultural and linguistic needs. Thus the paper suggests that secondary school programs like the Refugee Action Support (RAS) program can benefit refugee literacy by creating a partnership of schools and non-government organizations.  Programs  Dr. Georgis's 2014 book offers another example of extracurricular support for refugee children called involved Transition support programs. The study suggests that this program offers classroom support for English Language learners, after school activities involving recreational activities and homework help, as well as parental support that includes English as well as computer classes. In school services include interpretation, translation, personal communication through phone by the school to the homes, cultural mediation and advocacy. The study concluded that cultural brokers who support refugee parents foster a sense of belonging and support for refugee children as well. A review on the refugee action support program created by a partnership among the Australian Literacy and Numeracy foundation the University of Western Sydney and the NSW department of education and training found that RAS supported the educational goals of the schools in Australia. For example, tutors provided assistance in completing assignments. RAS tutors also allowed for specialized support that teachers often did not have the time to provide. Another supplemental school program is ACE. A research paper analyzing ACE by Heidi Lynn Biron found that ACE provides support for refugees who struggle with exclusion and school as a result of their English skills and trauma. A 2000 study by Dr. Zhou and Dr. Bankston found that while Vietnamese refugees may do well in school academically, they may have psychological strains that are often overlooked due to their academic performance. The study recommended peer support groups, so the children can share their stress with each other. One 2007 research paper by Dr. Beirens detailed the Children's Fund Service, a program involved in creating social bridges to reduce refugee children social exclusion specifically by giving practical and emotional support. == Disabilities == Children with disabilities frequently suffer physical and sexual abuse, exploitation, and neglect. They are often not only excluded from education, but also not provided the necessary supports for realizing and reaching their full potential. In refugee camps and temporary shelters, the needs of children with disabilities are often overlooked. In particular, a study surveying Bhutanese refugee camps in Nepal, Burmese refugee camps in Thailand, Somali refugee camps in Yemen, the Dadaab refugee camp for Somali refugees in Kenya, and camps for internally displaced persons in Sudan and Sri Lanka, found that many mainstream services failed to adequately cater to the specific needs of children with disabilities. The study reported that mothers in Nepal and Yemen have been unable to receive formulated food for children with cerebral palsy and cleft palates. The same study also found that, although children with disabilities were attending school in all surveyed countries, and refugee camps in Nepal and Thailand have successful programs that integrate children with disabilities into schools, all other surveyed countries have failed to encourage children with disabilities to attend school.Reilly, Rachael. \\"Disabilities among refugees and conflict-affected populations.\\" Forced Migration Review 35 (2010): 8. Similarly, Syrian parents consulted during a four-week field assessment conducted in northern and eastern Lebanon in March 2013 reported that, since arriving in Lebanon, their children with disabilities had not been attending school or engaging in other educational activities.‚ÄúDisability Inclusion in the Syrian Refugee Response in Lebanon.‚Äù New York: Women‚Äôs Refugee Commission, July 2013. https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Disability_Inclusion_in_the_Syrian_Refugee_Response_in_Lebanon.pdf. In Jordan, too, Syrian refugee children with disabilities identified lack of specialist educational care and physical inaccessibility as the main barriers to their education.UNICEF. \\"Access to Education for Syrian Refugee Children and Youth in Jordan Host Communities.\\" UNICEF, Jordan (2015). Likewise, limited attention is being given to refugee children with disabilities in the United Kingdom. It was reported in February 2017 that its government has decided to partially suspend the Vulnerable Children's Resettlement Scheme, originally set to resettle 3,000 children with their families from countries in the Middle East and North Africa. As a result of this suspension, no youth with complex needs, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties, would be accepted into the program until further notice. Countries may often overlook refugee children with disabilities with regards to humanitarian aid, because data on refugee children with disabilities are limited. Roberts and Harris (1990) note that there is insufficient statistical and empirical information on disabled refugees in the United Kingdom.Roberts, Keri, and Jennifer Harris. Disabled refugees and asylum seekers in Britain: Numbers and social characteristics. University of York, Social Policy Research Unit, 1999. While it was reported in 2013 that 26 percent of all Syrian refugees in Jordan had impaired physical, intellectual, or sensory abilities, such data specifically for children do not exist. ==See also== *Education for refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons *Finnish war children *Mobile learning for refugees *Refugee women *Refugee health *Refugee *Refugee camp *UNICEF *UNHCR ==References * Educational Handbook for Refugee Parents.

It has been considered as a model compound of vitamin B12 for studying the properties and mechanism of action of the vitamin. It belongs to a class of bis(dimethylglyoximato)cobalt(III) complexes with different axial ligands, called cobaloximes. Chloro(pyridine)cobaloxime is a yellow-brown powder that is sparingly soluble in most solvents, including water. ==Structure== The complex adopts a distorted octahedral geometry. Cobalt(III) is bound to two dimethylglyoximate ligands, i.e., mono-deprotonated dimethylglyoxime, in the equatorial plane. Completing the coordination sphere are chloride and a pyridine at the axial positions. ==Reactions== The cobaloxime is slowly decomposed by acids and bases. With acids, the products of decomposition are dimethylglyoxime, cobalt salts, and pyridine; with bases, derivatives of other cobaloximes are formed, usually with the release of chloride ions. The complex has no reaction with hydrogen gas, and cannot carry oxygen as salcomine does. It would, however, react with hydrogen in the presence of sodium hydroxide, a catalytic amount of platinum metal, or a reduced cobaloxime, therefore once the reduction occurs, the hydrogenation would occur much more rapidly as there is autocatalysis. The reduction products of cobaloxime depends on the conditions. At pH near 7, a cobaloxime with a CoII center is formed. With a higher pH, the cobalt center would be further reduced to the CoI state, which is supernucleophilic. ==Preparation== The compound is usually prepared by mixing cobalt(II) chloride, dimethylglyoxime and pyridine in an ethanolic solution. This process afford the cobaloxime(II), which is subsequently oxidized by the oxygen in air: : 4 CoCl2‚Ä¢6H2O + 8 dmgH2 \\\\+ 8 py + O2 ‚Üí 4 ClCo(dmgH)2py + 4 py‚Ä¢HCl + 14 H2O Using cobalt(II) acetate in place of cobalt(II) chloride produce aceto(pyridine)cobaloxime. This acetate can be converted to the respective bromide, iodide, cyanate, cyanide, azide and thiocyanate. : (CH3COO)Co(DH)2py + NaX ‚Üí XCo(DH)2py + NaCH3COO (X = Br, I, CNO, CN, N3 or SCN) ==Reactions== The pyridine base in the axial position can also be replaced by other organic bases containing a sp2 hybridized N atom as well. Commonly used bases are morpholine, 4-methylpyridine, imidazole and benzimidazole. The derivatives are again prepared via diacetocobaloxime, followed by the addition of the desired base, such as imidazole. : (CH3COO)2Co(DH)2 \\\\+ imi ‚Üí (CH3COO)Co(DH)2imi Alkylation of Co One of the methods used for producing the Co-C bond is to make use of the supernucleophilicity of the CoI center. Chloro(pyridine)cobaloxime(III) is first reduced to Chloro(pyridine)cobaloxime(I) by sodium borohydride in alkaline solution, then an alkyl halide is added into the reaction mixture, and the desired Co-C bond is formed via a SN2 reaction. This method can be used to produce cobaloximes containing a primary or a secondary alkyl substituent. For derivatives with phenyl or vinyl substituent, the Grignard reaction is employed. However, since the dimethylglyoxime ligands contains two acidic H atoms in the oxime group, the Grignard reagent must be used in three-fold excess to compensate the loss. ==References== Category:Coordination compounds Category:Cobalt complexes Category:Cobalt(III) compounds Category:Ketoximes Category:Pyridine complexes ","title":"Chloro(pyridine)cobaloxime"},{"id":"35330560","text":"The Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary is the second-most senior civil servant of the Cabinet Office.

It has been argued that third-party punishments are the essence of social norms, as they are evolutionary stable unlike second-party punishments. It has also been shown that third-party punishments are exhibited in all examined populations, though the magnitude of the punishments varies greatly, and that costly punishment co-varies with altruistic behavior. Differences between within-group and inter-group altruistic punishments have also been observed. ==Experimental evidence== Some of the common experiments in experimental economics concerning the study of second-party punishments with respect to distribution and cooperation norms have been dictator games and prisoner's dilemma games. These games can also be effectively used in the study of third-party punishments with respect to distribution and cooperation norms with some modifications. Third-party dictator game Concerning third-party dictator game (TP-DG), the game was modified to include a third person with a punishment option between the dictator and the recipient. The dictator was given an endowment of 100, of which he could choose to share any portion with the recipient. The third person observer was also given an endowment of 50, of which he could choose to spend in order to punish the dictator. If self-interest was the driving force for the decision making, then the dictator would choose to donate none of his endowment, and the third party observer would choose to spend none of his endowment punishing the dictator. However, roughly 60% of the third party observers chose to punish dictators who donated less than half their endowment. In a variation of the TP-DG, the third party observer could choose to spend part of the endowment to punish the dictator or could spend part of the endowment to compensate the recipient. About 40% of the third party observers chose to do both, while 32% chose to compensate the recipient and only about 6% opted to punish only. This indicates that compensation is preferred over punishment in the TP-DG when an offer is perceived as unfair. This suggests that third-party punishment may be motivated by a desire to both provide justice for those who have been wronged and to reprimand those who violate expected social norms. Third-party prisoner's dilemma Concerning third-party prisoner's dilemma (TP-PD), the game was modified so that in addition to two players who would choose to either cooperate or defect, a third party observer could choose to punish the players. The payoffs of the game were such that the players would be best off if they defected; however, if both players chose to defect, their payoff would be less than if they had cooperated. The observer could then choose to spend from his endowment to punish the defectors who chose to put self-interest ahead of cooperation. From previous theories, it can be concluded that subjects are willing to cooperate if the probability that others will also do so is sufficiently large. Once again, if self-interest was the decision maker for these players, neither would choose to cooperate, and the observer would also choose to keep his full endowment and not issue any punishments. However, about 45.8% of observers chose to punish the defector when he is paired with a cooperator, and 20.8% chose to punish both players if they had both defected. It's important to note that the magnitude of punishment was much larger when one defected. Second- party vs. third-party punishments With respect to the distribution norms violations (dictator games), it has been shown that second-party punishments are consistently higher than third-party punishments for dictators that choose to share less than half of their endowment. The punishments were such that the dictators could still profit from giving less than half in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. The levels of punishment were consistently low for both second and third-party punishments if the levels of endowment were higher than half. With respect to the cooperation norms violations (prisoner's dilemma), it has been shown that second-party punishments are consistently higher than third-party punishments for defectors. The punishments were such that the defectors could still profit in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. Punishment for cooperators were negligible under both conditions. ==Evolution and neural basis== Current evolutionary models state that human altruism evolved through the selective (cultural or biological) extinction of groups in inter-group conflicts. However, there is also evidence for altruism and norms between groups. Some models suggest that third party punishment of \\"free-riders\\" (those who do not cooperate) leads to increased group cooperation due to individual selection for cooperative traits. When subjects were examined with a PET scan while playing a second-party trust game with another player, it was shown that when they administered punishment, the dorsal striatum, an area of the brain associated with the processing of rewards as a result of goal-directed actions, was activated. It was also shown that individuals with stronger activations of the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater cost in order to punish the norm violator. This suggests that the people that administrated punishment against norm violators derived satisfaction from the act. FMRI has also been used to examine third-party punishment. Subjects participated in a TP-DG during the scan as either a second party recipient or a third party observer. The nucleus accumbens, a brain region associated with reward, had punishment-related activation for both the second-party and third-party punishment conditions. The overall pattern of activation was consistent between the two conditions, though activation was stronger in the second party recipients. This suggests that second-party and third-party punishment decisions have a common neural basis. ==Cross-culture variations== It has been shown that altruistic punishment exists across many examined populations, but that there is also a large variance between them. Data gathered from 15 different populations showed that when participating in TP-DG, all societies showed a decreasing frequency of punishment as the dictator's offer approached 50%. There was, however, a large variance between societies as to how much of their endowment the observers were willing to pay in order to punish the dictator. These variances were not attributed to economic and demographic variables. It was also found that societies with high degrees of punishment also exhibit more altruistic behavior. Other studies have suggested that people in larger, more complex societies engage in significantly more third-party punishment than people in small-scale societies. == Gender and age differences == Women have been found to contribute more in dictator games and also to be more likely to accept an offer than men, rather than to reject an offer to punish the dictator. This was found for second-party punishment experiments but has not been observed in studies examining third-party punishment. In mock trial experiments studying third-party punishment using legal scenarios, woman majority mock juries are more likely to convict than non-woman majority juries and are more likely to find a defendant guilty in a rape case. Men are more likely to be influenced by the attractiveness of the defendant than women. There are significant differences in third-party punishment behavior between age groups. In a variation of the TP-DG, 8-year-olds based their punishment on the outcome of the unfair result and did not consider the intention of the actor in both second-party and third-party punishment decisions. Adolescents integrated the outcome and the intention when making second- but not third-party punishment decisions. Adults integrated the outcome and the intention of the act for both second- and third-party punishment. This demonstrates developmental differences in how third-party punishment decisions are made. ==Parochial altruism== Parochial altruism refers to altruism that is directed in a preferential manner towards members of one's own social group. In order to examine this effect, a study examined the outcomes of TP-DG experiments carried out in between two Papua New Guinea indigenous groups. The games had 4 conditions, which included: players A (dictator), B (recipient), and C (observer) all from the same group; only A and B from the same group; only A and C from the same group; only B and C from the same group. Current behavioral theories state that norms are emergent from interactions within groups, and therefore, outsiders don‚Äôt obey the norm nor benefit from the altruistic behavior the norm enforces. This theory would therefore predict that no punishment will occur in any of the cases except for the ABC treatment condition. However, it was found that punishment was qualitatively similar in all 4 conditions, which suggests that egalitarian sharing norms exist within- groups and also between-groups. It was observed that, while all 4 conditions exhibited egalitarian sharing norms, punishments were much higher in the ABC and BC conditions. This suggests that victims are more protected if the third- party observer belongs to same group as them. It was also found that the dictators expected much harsher punishments if third-party observers belonged to the same group as the victim. It was also found that transfers were higher in groups with the same A and B members, and lower in groups with the same A and C members, suggesting that the dictators expected leniency from third- party observers of their own group. ==See also== *Altruism *Behavioral economics *Dual inheritance theory *Experimental economics *Game theory *Juries *Neuroeconomics *Norm (social) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * Category:Punishment ","title":"Third-party punishment"},{"id":"35330783","text":"Sev is a popular Indian snack food consisting of small pieces of crunchy noodles made from chickpea flour paste, which are seasoned with turmeric, cayenne, and ajwain before being deep-fried in oil.

It added new 220 kV transmission capacity to the National Grid by providing 37 km of underground cable between the Pakuranga, Penrose, and Albany substations. The project included new grid exit points at Hobson Street (Auckland CBD) and Wairau Road (North Shore) and a cable across the Auckland Harbour Bridge. The estimated total cost of the cable aspects of the works was $415 million. The project was completed and the connection was commissioned in February 2014 at a final cost of NZ$473 million. ==Overview== The NAan project established a 220 kV connection between the Pakuranga and Penrose substations, and a further 220 kV connection between the Penrose and Albany substations. The Penrose to Albany section included connections to the zone substations owned by Vector at Hobson Street in the Auckland CBD, and Wairau Road in the North Shore, and established new grid exit points at both of those locations. The 220 kV circuit from Pakuranga to Penrose: * increased capacity to the Penrose substation by adding a third 220 kV circuit alongside the existing 220 kV Otahuhu‚ÄìPenrose double-circuit line * added to the security provided by the Whakamaru to Brownhill Road transmission line (known as the North Island Grid Upgrade or NIGU project), increasing the diversity of transmission from the south into the Auckland region by establishing a 220 kV transmission connection from Pakuranga to Penrose. The 220 kV circuit from Penrose to Albany: * increased capacity to the Northland region (including the North Isthmus) by adding a third 220 kV circuit to the existing 220 kV double- circuit line from Otahuhu to Henderson * built on the NIGU project and increased the diversity for transmission from the south into the Northland region (including the North Isthmus), by establishing 220 kV transmission from Pakuranga, through Penrose, to Albany * provided capacity and security to Vector's Hobson Street and Wairau Road substations through a 220 kV connection to the Albany‚ÄìPenrose circuit, and enabled Vector to redistribute load from existing grid exit points, particularly the Albany 33 kV and 110 kV (Wairau Road) loads and Auckland CBD loads. ==Background== The North Auckland and Northland region covers the upper parts of the North Island, north of Henderson. It includes the North Shore and Waitakere, the Rodney District and the entire Northland region. The main electricity load centres in the region are the North Auckland urban areas, Whangarei, and the Marsden Point Oil Refinery. The North Auckland urban area is growing rapidly. Since the Auckland Harbour Bridge opened in 1959, the North Shore alone has expanded nearly five- fold, from a population of 50,000 in the late 1950s to 229,000 in June 2011. The after diversity maximum demand (ADMD) for electricity in the North Auckland and Northland region is forecast to grow from 908 megawatts in 2012 to 1254 megawatts by 2027. This is an average annual growth rate of 2.2 percent, which is higher than the national average of 1.7 percent per annum. There are no large generating stations operating in the region, although there are local generation schemes with a combined total output of around 54 megawatts. Two large generating stations were built in Northland in the late 1960s and early 1970s ‚Äì the 250 MW Marsden A and Marsden B oil-fired thermal power stations at Marsden point . However, the 1973 oil crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, and the discovery of Maui gas saw Marsden B mothballed before it was commissioned. Marsden A was relegated to a reserve generator during drought years before being decommissioned in 1997. Plans were developed in 2004 to refurbish and modify the Marsden B station to become a 300 MW coal- fired power station, but these were subsequently scrapped in 2007 after widespread protest. Because of the lack of generation in the North Auckland and Northland region, nearly all of the electricity used in the area must be supplied via transmission lines that run through Auckland, carrying electricity from Otahuhu, and generators in the Waikato region. Prior to the commissioning of the NAaN project, the main route for electricity transmission into the North Auckland and Northland region was through the double-circuit 220 kV Henderson to Otahuhu via Southdown line. This is a high capacity line, rated to operate at 938/984 MVA (summer/winter) per circuit in normal circumstances and slightly higher during contingencies, but restricted to 915 MVA due to constraints at Henderson substation. There were also two double circuit 110 kV lines that run parallel to the 220 kV line via Hepburn Road (Glendene) and Mount Roskill, with one line going via Mangere. However, these lines are of relatively low capacity and on their own could support only a very small proportion of the total load north of Mount Roskill. Therefore, the Henderson-Otahuhu double circuit 220 kV line represented a single mode of failure for the supply of electricity to the entire North Auckland and Northland region. A study of the High Impact, Low Probability (HILP) risks associated with the Henderson to Otahuhu 220 kV transmission line was included as one of the submissions made by Transpower to the Electricity Commission in early 2009, in support of the need for the NAan project. The line was also fast approaching capacity with the load growth, with some circuits expected to overload from 2017 during certain outages. The vulnerability of the transmission line was subsequently shown on 30 October 2009 at around 8:00am, when power was cut to the whole of Northland and most of the northern half of Auckland, affecting 280,000 consumers (14.5% of the country). A forklift carrying a shipping container accidentally hit one of the Henderson to Otahuhu circuits while the other circuit was out for maintenance, leaving the region supplied by the four low capacity 110 kV circuits. Power was restored to the entire region around 11:00am. ==Project timeline== Key milestones in the history of the project are: * 2005 ‚Äì Cable ducts installed alongside the route of the Northern Motorway, during the construction of the Northern Busway, between the Auckland Harbour Bridge and Constellation Drive. * 21 September 2007 ‚Äì Transpower submitted a Grid Upgrade Plan proposal to the Electricity Commission, following a period of consultation with stakeholders. The estimated cost of the project at that time was $521 million. * 9 November 2007 ‚Äì Vector made a submission to the Electricity Commission supporting the main NAan proposal. * 9 May 2008 ‚Äì Transpower submitted revised versions of the NAaN proposals to the Commission, seeking approval for $577 million for the main proposal. * May 2008 ‚Äì the Commission gave designated transmission customers and parties affected by the revised proposals an opportunity to comment. * 19 December 2008 ‚Äì the Commission published a notice of its intention to decline Transpower's NAaN proposal, and gave further opportunities for affected parties to comment * 23 December 2009 ‚Äì the Commission received requests from Transpower and Vector for a public conference to provide a final opportunity for comment on the proposed investment. * 13 February 2009 ‚Äì the Commission held a technical briefing in Auckland and called for submissions. * 2 March 2009 ‚Äì a public conference was held * 30 April 2009 ‚Äì the Commission decided to approve NAaN proposal, and published a final decision, following consideration of additional material made available at the public conference. * 15 June 2010 ‚Äì Vector and Transpower sign security of supply agreement for access to the Vector tunnel between Penrose and Hobson Street. * 31 May 2011 ‚Äì Tunnel access agreement between Transpower and Vector becomes unconditional. * 30 March 2012 ‚Äì First section of cable installed in the Northern Busway ==The route== Pakuranga to Penrose The 9 km long route of the underground cables between Pakuranga and Penrose is mainly in the road carriageway of Ti Rakau Drive and the South Eastern Highway. For the final section approaching Penrose, the route is adjacent to existing overhead transmission lines in a designated transmission corridor. Where the cables cross the Tamaki River and Pakuranga Creek they are attached to the relevant road bridge. The original Pakuranga-Penrose A 110 kV overhead transmission line is removed. Penrose to Hobson Street Between Penrose and Hobson Street, the NAan project cables are installed in Vector's 9 km long tunnel from Penrose to Hobson St. The tunnel is about 3 m in diameter and was completed in 2001 to secure electricity supply into central Auckland, especially after the 1998 Auckland power crisis. The tunnel follows the Auckland Southern Motorway between Penrose and the Symonds Street interchange, where the tunnel passes through central city streets, via Vector's Liverpool Street zone substation, to the Hobson Street substation. At Hobson Street, a new grid exit point with a single 250 MVA 220/110 kV was to be established, connecting to Vector's Hobson Street zone substation and supplying Vector's central city distribution network. Vector had two existing 110 kV cables paralleling the Transpower cable, connecting Penrose and Hobson Street via Liverpool Street, which continue to provide extra capacity and redundancy. Hobson Street to Albany Auckland Harbour Bridge From the Hobson Street substation, the NAan cables are installed in ducts along a route through Fanshawe Street and Westhaven to the Auckland Harbour Bridge. The route across the bridge is on a purpose built cable support structure. From the Harbour Bridge the route follows the Northern Busway. The cables are installed in ducts that were originally placed during the construction of the busway in 2005. Cable joint bays are installed at 500‚Äì800 m intervals. The cables are deviated from the Northern Busway at Wairau Road to connect to a new grid exit point (Wairau Road) adjacent to Vector's Wairau Valley zone substation, containing a single 120 MVA 220/33 kV connecting into the Wairau Valley zone substation and supplying the southern North Shore. Vector's work at this site includes the conversion of the existing outdoor 33 kV switchyard into an indoor switchroom. From Wairau Road, the cable route again follows the Northern Busway to Constellation Drive. The NAaN cables leave the Northern Motorway at Constellation Drive, and are installed in trenches and ducts beneath roads in Albany to Transpower's Albany Substation. Vector has three existing 110 kV overhead line circuits connecting Albany to Wairau Valley to provide redundancy on this section.

Joseph Brooks Yates was his eldest brother; another brother, Richard Vaughan Yates (4 August 1785 ‚Äì 30 November 1856) was the donor of Prince's Park to the inhabitants of Liverpool, while John Ashton Yates became an MP. His father, minister (1777‚Äì1823) of the dissenting congregation in Kaye Street, Liverpool, which moved to Paradise Street (1791), was a noted preacher. Receiving early training from William Shepherd, he entered Glasgow University in 1805, and went on for his divinity course (1808) to Manchester College, then at York, under Charles Wellbeloved. While still a student he acted (1809‚Äì10) as assistant classical tutor for John Kenrick. From York he went to Edinburgh University (1810), and Glasgow University again (1811). Before graduating M.A. at Glasgow (1812), he became unordained minister (October 1811) of a Unitarian congregation, for which a new chapel was opened (15 November 1812) in Union Place; he create a stable church out of previously discordant elements. With Thomas Southwood Smith, he founded (28 July 1813) the Scottish Unitarian Association. On 6 April 1817 he succeeded Joshua Toulmin as colleague to John Kentish at the new meeting, Birmingham (see also Church of the Messiah, Birmingham), a post which he resigned at the end of 1825; and for a time he left the ministry, and resided at Norton Hall, near Sheffield. In 1827 he spent a semester at the University of Berlin, as a student of classical philology. In 1819 Yates was elected a fellow of the Geological Society; in 1822 of the Linnean Society; in 1831 of the Royal Society; and in 1831 he was appointed secretary to the council of the British Association. In the same year he was elected a trustee of Dr. Williams's foundations (resigned 26 June 1861). In 1832 he succeeded John Scott Porter as minister of Carter Lane Chapel, Doctors' Commons, London. His congregation was increased by a secession (September 1834) from the ministry of William Johnson Fox at South Place Chapel, Finsbury. Yates resigned early in the following year. He remained a member of the Presbyterian section of the \\"general body\\" of ministers of the three denominations, and when other unitarians seceded in 1836, Yates retained his connection with the \\"general body\\". Shortly Yates left the ministry, and, being unordained, took the style of a layman. He worked for Dr. Williams's trust, introducing the system of competitive examinations for scholarships. His later years were spent in learned leisure at Lauderdale House, Highgate where he had a library and a collection of works of art. He was probably the first to see the antiquarian value of the book Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834 authored by his friend Alexander Blair and Francis Ronalds and ensured it was preserved in the Royal Archaeological Institute's collection. He also helped examine the important fossil Cycadeoidea gibsoniana found by Ronalds‚Äô cousin Thomas Field Gibson. Yates died at Lauderdale House on 7 May 1871, and was buried at Highgate Cemetery on 11 May. He married (about 1820) Dorothea, daughter of John William Crompton of Edgbaston, who survived him without issue. His will left benefactions including endowments for chairs in University College, London, but his property did not realise the estimated amount. ==Works== In 1814 Ralph Wardlaw delivered the series of pulpit addresses later published as Discourses on the Principal Points of the Socinian Controversy (1814). Yates had heard them given, and, on their appearance in print, published his Vindication of Unitarianism, 1815, (4th edit. 1850). On this, Strictures (1814) were published by John Brown. Wardlaw replied in Unitarianism incapable of Vindication, 1816, to which Yates rejoined in A Sequel, 1816. His position was broad, his aim being to take common ground on which Arians and Socinians could unite. His biblical conservatism, which he maintained, was criticised in the Prospective Review, 1851, p. 50\\\\. Yates issued (1833) proposals for an organisation of the Unitarian congregations of Great Britain on the presbyterian model; the plan was abortive, though it obtained the support of John Relly Beard, Joseph Hunter, and John James Tayler. In the course of the Hewley case, Sir Lancelot Shadwell had condemned the Improved Version of the New Testament, issued (1808) by Unitarians. Yates wrote A Letter to the Vice- chancellor, 1834, defending the version, which produced a reply by Robert Halley. Apart from Leonhard Schmitz, Yates was the largest contributor to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, 1842, edited by William Smith; he furnished drawings for one half of the woodcuts, and wrote one-eighth of the text. Only the first part, with appendices, of his Textrinum Antiquorum (1843) was published. Papers on arch√¶ological subjects were contributed by him to the learned societies of London and Liverpool; among reprints of these are papers on The Use of the terms Acanthus, Acanthion, 1845 (from the Classical Museum); Account of a Roman Sepulchre at Geldestone, 1849; The Use of Bronze Celts, 1849; and Observations on the Bulla worn by Roman Boys, 1851, (from the Arch√¶ological Journal); Some Account of a Volume containing Portions of \\"Ptolemy's Geography,\\" 1864 (from Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature). He became a strong advocate of the decimal system; among many tracts on this subject, he published a Narrative of the ‚Ä¶ Formation of the International Association for ‚Ä¶ a Uniform Decimal System, 1856 (two editions); What is the Best Unit of Length, Hackney, 1858; Handbook to ‚Ä¶ Synoptic Table ‚Ä¶ of the Metric System, Edinburgh, 1864. Among Yates's other publications were: * ‚ÄòThoughts on the Advancement of Academical Education,‚Äô 1826; 2nd ed. 1827. * ‚ÄòOutlines of a Constitution for the University of London,‚Äô 1832. * ‚ÄòObservations on Lord John Russell's Bill ‚Ä¶ with the Outlines of a Plan for registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages,‚Äô 1836; ‚ÄòPostscript,‚Äô 1836. * ‚ÄòPreces e Liturgiis Ecclesi√¶ Catholic√¶ Roman√¶ desumpt√¶: cum earundem Versione Anglica ‚Ä¶ Accedunt Versiones ‚Ä¶ nov√¶ ‚Ä¶ Germanica et Polonica,‚Äô 1838 (Polish version by Stephen Mazoch). * 'Memorials of Dr. Priestley' (1860): a descriptive catalogue of portraits and relics of Priestley, exhibited that year at Dr. Williams's Library, Red Cross Street, including Yates's own collection, which was presented to the Royal Society by his widow in June 1871. * 'Descriptive Catalogue of ‚Ä¶ Current Coins of all Countries in the International Exhibition,' 1862.

Although it never flew, it was notable for being the first aircraft designed by Horace Short. ==Design and development== The Short No.1 was built for Francis McClean, who had seen Wilbur Wright's flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. McClean, a keen astronomer, had to leave on an expedition to observe a solar eclipse in China, but wrote to Horace Short, whom he had only met once, asking him to build him an aeroplane. Horace Short began design work in November 1908,Barnes 1967, p.6 and construction of the aircraft was started at Short Brothers' Battersea workshop in early 1909. The uncovered airframe was exhibited in March at the 1909 London Aero Show at Olympia.\\"Flyers at Olympia\\". Flight Volume 1, No. 13, 27 March 1909. p. 175. The aircraft was a three-bay biplane with a biplane elevator and central fin mounted on two pairs of converging booms in front. The chord of the outer bay of each wing was extended aft to form flexible extensions to effect lateral control: between the tips of these extensions, four balanced rudders were pivoted. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of ash skids extending forward, almost as far as the elevators. No wheels were fitted, as it was intended to use a launching rail for takeoff.Barnes 1967, p.42 Apart from the skids, the entire airframe was built of spruce, and was covered with Continental brand rubberised fabric. The engine, originally intended to be a version of the Wright's vertical 4-cylinder engine made by Bariquand et Marre, drove a pair of pusher propellers, mounted slightly above mid-gap using a chain drive. This was arranged so that both propellers revolved in the same direction, since crossing them to make them revolve in opposite directions might have infringed patents held by the Wright brothers.Barnes 1967, p.42 Work continued at the newly established Short Brothers works on the Isle of Sheppey, and was complete upon McClean's return from China. The Bariquand et Marre engine was not yet available, so a engine taken from a Nordenfelt car was installed. However, at more than in weight, when a first attempt at flight was made in September, the engine failed to propel the machine even as far as the end of the launching rail. The Bariquand et Marre engine arrived in October, and McClean made three attempts at flight on 2, 3 and 6 November, almost succeeding in becoming airborne, but on the last attempt he applied full up- elevator, and the machine stalled and fell back on the launch rail, breaking the undercarriage and propellers: it was not repaired.Barnes 1967, p.43 McClean's next aircraft was a copy of the Wright Model A built under license by Short Brothers. ==SpecificationsReferences== ;Citations ;Bibliography *Barnes, C.H.

It was founded in Seattle, Washington, in 1891. Washington Shoe Company is a fourth-generation family owned and operated business. The manufacturer is known for its Western Chief brand of boots for men, women, and kids. The company also makes women's fashion focused waterproof boots under the Chooka brand and plush slippers for men and women under the Staheekum brand. ==History== Founded in Seattle on January 24, 1891 by T.J. Thorsen (Vice President and General Manager), L.B. Allain (President), and G.M. Barber (Secretary). It was Seattle's first shoe company, making boots and shoes for outdoor workers with more of a demand for the Alaska Gold Rush in 1898. Boots were made under the name, Western Chief. In 1911, Henry Moehring joined the company, buying out his remaining partners when T.J. Thorsen died. In 1928, it was one of five shoe manufacturers in Lynn, Massachusetts whose workers went on strike, upon their rejecting a pay cut upheld by a state board. In 1957, brothers Norm and Robert Moehring took over the company from their father, Henry Moehring. In 1974, Rob (son of Robert Moehring) joined the family business. In 1990, Rob acquired the company from his father and uncle, refocusing on rubber boots under the Western Chief brand. Then in 1991, Rob's son Mark Moehring joined the family business. In 1996, the company moved from Seattle to Renton, WA. The company introduced 3D character boots for kids. Sheepskin slippers were added under the name Staheekum. In 2001, due to new technology, women's and kids' rubber rain boots debuted a range of novelty printed boots. The company relocated to Kent, WA. In 2002, Chooka sheepskin boots were launched, evolving into women's fashion- forward rubber boots. Rob Moehring's son, Karl Moehring joined the family business. In 2015, Karl Moehring took over the company from his father, Rob, and now serves as CEO. Rob Moehring assumed the role of Chairman.

Sir John Parnell, 2nd Baronet (25 December 1744 ‚Äì December 1801) was an Anglo-Irish Member of Parliament. A Church of Ireland landowner, his family had originally migrated to Ireland from Congleton in Cheshire. Although not from a Roman Catholic Irish background, Parnell is renowned in Irish history for his efforts to bring about a more emancipated country and was the great-grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Home Rule campaign. Parnell first served in the Parliament of Ireland as one of the members for Bangor, from 1767 to 1768. He later sat for Queen's County from 1783 until the Union with Great Britain created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. After the Union, he gained a seat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom for a short time as member for Queen's County, but died in December of the same year. From a line of politically astute ancestors who had moved to Ireland in the 17th century, Parnell rose to the highest positions in Irish politics as Commissioner of the Revenue (1780), Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland (1787), and Lord of the Treasury (1793). He died suddenly in London in 1801. ==Opposers== Sir John's great-grandson, the legendary land-reformer Charles Stewart Parnell The only son of Sir John Parnell, 1st Baronet, Parnell was the great-grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell, known as the uncrowned king of Ireland and was best known for opposing (with his son Henry) the Act of Union between the two kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Before this, Parnell was a Commander of Irish Volunteers and had been instrumental in winning the right for Irish Roman Catholics to vote and to be elected to Parliament. However, the latter faltered when the parliament of Ireland was dissolved in 1800. Henry Grattan described Parnell as \\"an honest, straightforward, independent man, possessed of considerable ability and much public spirit; as Chancellor of the Exchequer he was not deficient, and he served his country by his plan to reduce the interest of money. He was amiable in private, mild in disposition, but firm in mind and purpose. His conduct at the Union did him honour, and proved how warmly he was attached to the interests of his country, and on this account he was dismissed\\". ==Family== Parnell married Laetitia Charlotte Brooke in 1774, and together they had four children. Their eldest son John Augustus was a deaf mute who was housed in a large walled garden for most of his life, while their second son Henry Brooke Parnell would go on to inherit the baronetcy and follow his own political career, becoming an Irish peer and also a member of parliament for Queen's County in the House of Commons at Westminster.

On qualifying in 1882, his rather quiet and studious life was changed by an invitation to accompany the botanist √âmile Bescherelle (1828-1903) on an expedition to Cape Horn aboard the ship La Romanche, a trip during which he amassed a fine collection of algae. On returning to France he studied natural sciences and was awarded a degree in 1888 whereupon he joined the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, working in the cryptogamic herbarium under Professor van Tieghem. Here he worked on classifying specimens that had been gathered by S√©bastien Vaillant (1669-1722), and those of the brothers Edmond and Charles Tulasne. He revised when necessary the taxonomy and systematics of the species described, and his name appears frequently as a second author for many species of algae. In 1890 he was awarded the Prix Montagne by the Academy of Sciences for his monograph on terrestrial algae of the genus Trentepohlia. He was awarded the Prix Desmazi√®res for 1913 for his work on marine flora. Besides publishing a guide to phycology in 1892, he contributed to a number of illustrated books on plants,Hariot, Paul Auguste (1854-1917) JSTOR Global Plants and published the first practical guide to seaweeds from the coast of France.

It is one of seven species of clematis native to New Zealand. C. paniculata is the most common of these, and is widespread in forest throughout the country. Growing from lowland areas up to low mountainous forests, it flowers between August and November. The MƒÅori name puawhananga translates as ‚Äúflower of the skies‚Äù, and traditionally its flowering meant the start of spring. Clematis paniculata kz08.jpg Clematis paniculata in Egmont NP 01.jpg Clematis paniculata kz2.jpg ==Description== Clematis paniculata is an evergreen woody high-climbing vine. It has a woody stem that is usually around 10 cm or more in diameter at the base. The leaves are dark and globous, sparsely hairy beneath. They have stout branchlets. They have a leaf margin of toothed, entire or lobed near apex, though they are rarely ever profoundly lobed. The Clematis paniculata leaflets texture is similar to leather meaning that you can see pores and wrinkles. The leaves are shiny and tough looking. The leaves have the shape of broadly ovate to broad oblong and heart-shaped to truncate at the base. The Clematis paniculata is a unisex plant though the male and female flowers are similar as both have six sepals, with white flowers lobed. But, the female flower has a smaller sepal than the male. They both have white sepals that are narrow towards the end, rectangular or rounded end. Females have few staminodes and males have lots. Females do not have persistent fruits. The female has hairy achenes that are 2‚Äì4 mm long. == Range ==  Natural global range  Clematis paniculata is native to New Zealand.  New Zealand range  Clematis paniculata was naturalised on the Chatham Islands and can be found throughout the North, South and Stewart Island. ==Habitat== C. paniculata is found throughout New Zealand in lowland and subalpine forests. Coastal to land between 300-800 meters above sea level in tall forest or shrubland. ==Ecology== Life cycle/Phenology The Clematis paniculata is like most plants and throughout the year has different periods where it flowers and produces fruits. It flowers from August to November and has fruit throughout October to January. These flowers are unisexual, which means that there are both female and male flowers.NZ Flora. Clematis paniculata J.F.Gmel. Retrieved on the 6/4/2020, from http://www.nzflora.info/factsheet/Taxon/Clematis-paniculata.html The difference between male and female flowers is that the male has a stamen, this is the male organ which bears pollen for the reproduction of the plant. The seeds are easily dispersed by wind and they are contained in a silky feather- like cluster. The germination period is within 2-3 months, but this can be erratic Department of Conservation.

This plant prefers the middle not overly wet, but can‚Äôt be too dry. Clematis is found in lowland areas; therefore, it is most likely to be located in locations with brown soil as brown soil is the most common soil in New Zealand. It extends all over the mountains and into the moist lowlands where you will find the Clematis paniculata. If the Clematis is located in the northern North Island, it will most likely be found in granular soil which is a volcanic material that has been derived from substantial weathering. Clematis prefers soil because it is found in areas that summer dryness is uncommon and soil that does not become waterlogged in the winter. It would have the perfect dampness the Clematis needs to thrive. Clematis paniculata prefers sunny areas as the vine will grow up other trees to be able to reach the sunlight. Though it does not thrive in humid climates as it becomes prone to powdery mildew. Predators, Parasites, and Diseases What feeds on the Clematis paniculata Clematis paniculata is one of the favourite plants for the honey bee to pollinate. Different kinds of rusts: There are four kinds of endemic rusts that effect the Clematis paniculata in New Zealand, and Aecidium otagense is one of these. Aecidium otagense is the most detrimental to the plant because it is the only kind of rust that can cause deformities in the flowers, leaves and stem. The deformities that the rust causes to the flower and stem are described as spectacular. Another particularly interesting kind of rust that affects the Clematis paniculata is Puccinia alboclava because It only affects the C. paniculata and no other kind of Clematis species. Puccinia alboclava is found in the soft leaves of the Clematis paniculata species seedling. It is only found to infect Clematis paniculata in Dunedin and the centre of the North Island The rust produces colourless teleutospore on the host. This is extremely rare kind of rust and appears to be the first to do this on a clematis species. 'Disease: Cucumber mosaic virus Cucumber mosaic virus is a virus that has been infecting the Clematis paniculata plants in the lowland forests near Dunedin. The virus has been associated with a dramatic decrease in the number of individual Clematis paniculata. It is so lethal to Clematis paniculata because it is not only able to infect the plant, but it also infects the trees that support it. The virus causes localised lesions, chlorotic spots rings and ringspot lesions, necrosis, premature leaf fall and leaf distortion in the plant. It is transferred from plant to plant by aphids; aphids move it through different ways. One way is the virions can be kept in an infectious state for the amount of time it takes for the aphid to go and give it to a plant that has not been infected yet. Aphids can infect to multiple (39) uninfected plants within 10 minutes after being in contact with an infected plant. This is what makes Cucumber mosaic virus so detrimental to crops, as the aphid can quickly and easily spread it from one plant to another. ==Cultural uses== Clematis paniculata or known in Te Reo as Puawananga is very important to the Maori community as it has great cultural significance. It is so crucial for many different reasons one of the main reasons is because it is a part of one of their legends as many tribes believe that Puawananga along with the Whauwhapaku are the offspring of Puanga (Rigel) which is the brightest star of the Orion constellation and Ruhua (Antares) the most shining star of the Scorpion constellation the rising of these two stars in the morning signals the approach of summer and the time between the two events from June to November happens at the same time as when the Puawananga flowers bloom. They also use the flowering of the plant as an indicator as that the season of spring has started and that the eels have started to migrate up the rivers to spawn therefore it was time to harvest them as this is a spring event, so the two events of the flowering and eel migrating coincided. The woman would also use the Puawananga to make decorative pieces for wreaths and garlands they would make for their hair. There are also records of the past Maori ancestors using Puawananga for medical purposes. Females would use it for multiple things such as general blood disorders, skin eruptions, kidney troubles, haemorrhages and bleeding piles. They would use the leaves to produce blisters as a counter-irritant and the sap to help heal wounds. Puawananga was only taken by women. They would take it three times daily before meals. ==No similar Taxa== Something unique about the Clematis paniculata is that there are no similar taxa to it in New Zealand whether it is endemic, native or an exotic species there is nothing else like the dark green colour of the leaves. The leathery texture with an entire margin and the unique white flowers. It is the only species that fit these categories in New Zealand, which is what makes it so unique and special, along with being a native plant. ==References== paniculata Category:Flora of New Zealand Category:Endemic flora of New Zealand ","title":"Clematis paniculata"},{"id":"35331363","text":"Punicacortein D is an ellagitannin, a type of phenolic compound.

The notation is changed a bit in this article for consistency with the matrix normal distribution article. The matrix t-distribution shares the same relationship with the multivariate t-distribution that the matrix normal distribution shares with the multivariate normal distribution. For example, the matrix t-distribution is the compound distribution that results from sampling from a matrix normal distribution having sampled the covariance matrix of the matrix normal from an inverse Wishart distribution. In a Bayesian analysis of a multivariate linear regression model based on the matrix normal distribution, the matrix t-distribution is the posterior predictive distribution. ==Definition== For a matrix t-distribution, the probability density function at the point \\\\mathbf{X} of an n\\\\times p space is : f(\\\\mathbf{X} ; u,\\\\mathbf{M},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Omega) = K \\\\times \\\\left\\\\mathbf{I}_n + \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{X} - \\\\mathbf{M})\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Omega^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{X}-\\\\mathbf{M})^{\\\\rm T}\\\\right^{-\\\\frac{ u+n+p-1}{2}}, where the constant of integration K is given by : K = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_p\\\\left(\\\\frac{ u+n+p-1}{2}\\\\right)}{(\\\\pi)^\\\\frac{np}{2} \\\\Gamma_p\\\\left(\\\\frac{ u+p-1}{2}\\\\right)} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Omega^{-\\\\frac{n}{2}} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma^{-\\\\frac{p}{2}}.

His short story \\"The House of Happy Mayhem\\" received an honorable mention in Best Horror of the Year 2009, edited by Ellen Datlow.

In 2001 he began to publish more frequently. In 2002 his story \\"Lovely Day for Beating an Old Guy\\" was published in the anthology Random Acts of Weirdness, edited by Brian Knight, which was the first piece to attract attention. Zelazny's professional debut came with the publication of his short story collection The Day the Leash Gave Way and Other Stories (Fantastic Books: Wilder Publications, 2009), featuring 20 previously published stories and four originals. On July 28, 2014, Black Curtain Press reissued the book with two additional stories, as well as an introduction by Zelazny. Though he had previously sold a novel (Destination Unknown) in 2008, it did not see release until December, 2011. Zelazny moved to Florida, then took some time away from writing, having developed severe alcoholism, as well as having lost his fianc√©e to suicide.http://trentzelaznybloggetyblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/angelyn.htmlhttps://stephenormsby.wordpress.com/2012/11/15/author- interview-special-edition-trent-zelazny-american-writer/ He then attempted suicide himself, but survived, about which he has repeatedly said he is grateful.

His most recent novel, Voiceless, was released on October 7, 2014 by Evil Jester Press in New York City. His novelette People Person, released on September 20, 2013 by Black Curtain Press, has been considered by many to be Zelazny's best work to date.

It was the second ever election of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong history based on the 1987 Review of Developments in Representative Government, as the Government's democratisation process according to the agreement of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. There were 12 members elected by Electoral Colleges, 14 members from functional constituencies. A total of 9,276 out of almost 17,000 registered votes turned out to return 13 candidates in 8 electoral college and 4 functional constituency seats while another 13 seats were returned unopposed. The liberal lobby suffered a major setback in the election as three of their outspoken leaders were defeated. ==Background== In May 1987, the government published the Green Paper, 1987 Review of Developments in Representative Government, to consider the next phase of the development of the representative government in Hong Kong after the 1985 Hong Kong electoral reform. The option of the direct elections in 1988 was strongly opposed by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Pro-Beijing organs including the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions were mobilised to send opposing submissions to the Hong Kong government. The Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government which was formed by pro-democracy activists including Legislative Councillors Martin Lee and Szeto Wah collected of 220,000 signatures demanding the direct elections. Pressured by the Beijing government, the Hong Kong government issued the White Paper in February 1988 indicated that there was a strong public desire for further development of government, but there was no clear consensus timing or the extent of the introduction of direct elections. The 1988 direct elections proposal was therefore turned down and postponed until 1991. Instead, the government added two new functional constituencies from 12 to 14 and reduced appointed members from 22 to 20. The voting method was also changed to the preferential elimination system. ==Composition== The Financial constituency was enlarged into Financial and Accountancy constituency in which the electors of the Finance electoral division remained as the members of the Hong Kong Association of Banks entitled to vote at the general meetings of the Association and electors of the Accountancy electoral division were accountants registered by the Hong Kong Society of Accountants under the Professional Accountants Ordinance. The Medical constituency were enlarged into Medical and Health Care constituency in which the Medical electoral division was elected by the medical and dental practitioners registered or deemed to be registered under the Medical Registration Ordinance or Dentists Registration Ordinance.

The species name is taken from the tree's name in Filipino. ==Distribution== D. dao is found in the tropical forests of: peninsular Malaysia (Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, Penang Isl., Perak, Pahan, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan), Borneo, Sumatra, Philippines (Luzon, Mindoro, Tablas, Negros, Leyte, Samar, Basilan, Mindanao, Palawan), Lesser Sunda Isl., Java, Sulawesi, Moluccas, New Guinea, Solomons, Andamans (South Andamans), Nicobars (Car Nicobar Island), E-India, Myanmar [Burma] (Kachin, Rakhine, Sagaing, Taninthayi, Mandalay, Yangon), Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. ==In popular culture== Use in decoration The seed surface typically displays an intricate pattern with an approximate five-fold symmetry, and its five rhombic protrusions are reminiscent of primitive Buddha images. It is revered and called \\"Five Buddhas\\" in the North-East of Thailand and in Laos. Namesake localities The municipality of Dao, Capiz and the Barangay (village) of Dau in Mabalacat, Pampanga are named after the dao tree. UPLB's leaning Dao A specific specimen of Dracontomelon dao has become an icon for students and a tourist attraction of sorts for the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. The tree inspired National Artist Leandro Locsin's design for the university's Student Union building, and for the buildings that now house UPLB's College of Agriculture and College of Development Communication - all three Locsin- designed buildings bearing a motif of repeating dao-like buttressed columns. The tree itself stood on the banks of Molawin Creek, on the site where the Student Union building was commissioned to be put up, so Locsin made the tree an element part of the building's layout, standing at the passenger drop-off point in front of the main entrance. Some time before 2005, the dao gradually began to lean \\"20 degrees to the side with respect to its vertical position due to its heavy crown and weakened root system\\", leading then-Chancellor Wilfredo P. David to order that it be cut down in 2005. With testimony from some of UPLB's plant pathologists and urban forestry experts, and support from the Philippines' National Commission on Culture and the Arts and Department of Environment and Natural Resources, protesters managed to prevent the tree from being cut until David's term ended, after which the next chancellor, Luis Rey I. Velasco, decided not to cut it, and instead declared it one of the University's twelve \\"Centennial Heritage Trees.\\" When Typhoon Milenyo battered Los Ba√±os and caused numerous trees in UPLB to fall down, the leaning Dao remained standing, turning the leaning dao into a legend of sorts; every time a strong typhoon comes along, UPLB constituents eagerly go to see if the dao is still standing, and anticipate another headline that says \\"UP Los Ba√±os' leaning dao tree survives (name of typhoon)\\". ==References== dao Category:Flora of tropical Asia Category:Trees of China Category:Decorative fruits and seeds Category:Taxa named by Francisco Manuel Blanco Category:Taxa named by Elmer Drew Merrill Category:Taxa named by Robert Allen Rolfe ","title":"Dracontomelon dao"},{"id":"35332500","text":"Arkeology is a compilation album by World Party released on April 10, 2012.

William Shepherd (11 October 1768 ‚Äì 21 July 1847) was an English dissenting minister and politician, known also as a poet and writer. ==Life== He was born in Liverpool on 11 October 1768. His father, a tradesman, took an active part in local politics, and was a freeman; he died in 1772. His mother, Elizabeth (died 1787), was daughter of Benjamin Mather, dissenting minister at Over Darwen. Under the supervision of his uncle, Tatlock Mather (died 1785), minister of a presbyterian (Unitarian) congregation at Rainford, near Prescot, William was successively educated: at Holden's academy near Rainford from 1776 to 1782; by Philip Holland from 1782 to 1785; at Daventry Academy from 1785 to 1788 under Thomas Belsham; and at New College, Hackney, from 1788 to 1790 under Belsham, Andrew Kippis, and Richard Price. On the completion of his academic course in 1790 he became tutor to the sons of the Rev. John Yates, including the future Unitarian minister James Yates, the merchant and member of parliament John Ashton Yates, and the antiquarian Joseph Brooks Yates. While a tutor Shepherd met William Roscoe, a significant influence; and became one of the group of reformers around Roscoe, known by Tory opponents as \\"Liverpool Jacobins\\", that included also James Currie, William Rathbone, and William Smyth, as well as his employer John Yates. the Roscoe Circle also brought William Hazlitt as an acquaintance (who painted his portrait).lordbyron.org, Memoirs of William Hazlitt Ch. VII 1803‚Äì05. In 1791 Shepherd became minister of the presbyterian (Unitarian) chapel at Gateacre, near Liverpool. There he opened a school, which he carried on with success; its pupils included three future members of parliament (Benjamin Gaskell, Daniel Gaskell, and John Ashton Yates).Unitarian Members of Parliament in the Nineteenth Century: A Catalogue, D. W. Bebbington (PDF). Shepherd was an enthusiast for civil and religious liberty; he was an abolitionist, and by 1790 an advocate of female suffrage. In May 1794, he went to London to visit his friend and college companion at Hackney, Jeremiah Joyce, who had been committed to the Tower of London on a charge of treason. After Joyce's death, in 1816, Shepherd adopted his youngest daughter, Hannah. When Gilbert Wakefield was sentenced in 1799 to two years' imprisonment, Shepherd took charge of his son and eldest daughter, besides visiting Wakefield in Dorchester gaol. On 27 May 1796 Shepherd was enrolled a burgess of Liverpool, and took part in municipal affairs in the liberal interest. He was an eloquent speaker, and several of his speeches were printed. His political nickname was \\"Sincerity\\" Shepherd.historyofparliamentonline.org, Liverpool borough, 1820‚Äì1832. He died at \\"The Nook\\", Gateacre, 21 July 1847, and was buried in the yard of the chapel. A marble tablet in the chapel, with inscription by Henry Brougham, was erected in 1850, surmounted by a bust in marble, the work of Isaac Jackson of Liverpool. His library was sold in Liverpool in December 1848. ==Portraits== There are numerous portraits of Shepherd.

In 1387, Adolph married Agnes, the daughter of Count Gottfried VIII of Ziegenhain. The marriage produced a son, Otto III, who would later succeed Adolph. Adolph III and his family lived at Landau Castle, which his father had assigned to him, and remained there after the county had been divided into Waldeck-Landau and Waldeck-Waldeck after his father's death in 1397. His reign was marked with conflicts with Henry VII. He disagrees with Henry's attack on the area around Kassel in 1400, which destroyed the alliance Waldeck had had with the Landgraviate of Hesse. Hesse responded by invading Waldeck. Adolph tried to restore good relations with Hesse. In 1406, Henry published nineteen complaints about Adolph and proposed to have the issue arbitrated by the mayors and councillors from Korbach and Niederwildungen. Adolph, in turn, accused Henry of selling Schartenberg to the Archbishop of Cologne without his consent. Attempts to mediate between the brothers were unsuccessful. It was not until 1421 that Adolph's brother-in-law, Count John II of Ziegenhain, managed to mediate a compromise between the two brothers and theirs sons, Otto III and Wolrad. The division of the county was confirmed, however, the brothers also agreed that no land would be sold off or mortgaged without knowledge and consent from the other family branch. Deeds relating to either half of the county were to be archived in a common archive at Waldeck Castle. Completed fiefs would revert to joint ownership. Future disputes were to be investigated and settled by the burgmannen and councils. In later years, this agreement was renewed and refined. == References == *Adolph Theodor Ludwig Varnhagen: Grundlage der Waldeckischen Landes- und Regentengeschichte.

Originally developed for combustion, it can also be used for liquid reactions by tuning some of its parameters. The model consists of rates calculated by two primary means. An Arrhenius, or kinetic rate, R_{K\\\\\\\\_i',k}, for species i' in reaction k, is governed by the local mean species concentrations and temperature in the following way: : R_{K\\\\\\\\_i',k} = - u_{i',k} M_i A_k T^{\\\\beta_k} \\\\exp{\\\\left( -\\\\frac{E_k}{RT} \\\\right)} \\\\prod_{j'=1}^{N} \\\\left[ C_{j'} \\\\right]^{\\\\eta_{j',k}} = K_{i',k} M_{i'} \\\\prod_{j'=1}^{N} \\\\left[ C_{j'} \\\\right]^{\\\\eta_{j',k}} This expression describes the rate at which species i' is consumed in reaction k. The constants A_k and E_k, the Arrhenius pre- exponential factor and activation energy, respectively, are adjusted for specific reactions, often as the result of experimental measurements. The stoichiometry for species i' in reaction k is represented by the factor u_{i',k}, and is positive or negative, depending upon whether the species serves as a product or reactant. The molecular weight of the species i' appears as the factor M_{i'}. The temperature, T, appears in the exponential term and also as a factor in the rate expression, with an optional exponent, \\\\beta_k.

Hanagan has twice been crowned champion jockey on the flat in Britain, riding 165 winners in 2011 to defend his title, having won his first title with 191 winners in 2010. == Childhood and early career == A graduate of the British Racing School, Hanagan sat on a horse for the first time aged 14, having previously harboured ambitions of playing football professionally, only to be told he was too small and light. His introduction to horse racing came through his father, Geoff, who had hoped to be a jockey and, having failed to make the grade in Newmarket, later rode out on weekends for local Warrington-based trainer Terry Caldwell. In a BBC interview in 2003, Hanagan recalls the moment he realised he wanted to be a jockey: \\"My dad used to ride out at Terry Caldwell's yard and I followed him down one weekend‚Ä¶that was how it all started. Straight away I thought this is something totally different‚Ä¶I thought: 'This is what I want to do'. I was still only about 11, but it was kind of like a bug.\\" Hanagan went on to help out at Caldwell's yard in Warrington, Cheshire, riding out for the first time aged 14 and continuing his work experience there until leaving school to start a 9-week course at the British Racing School in 1997. Hanagan's first job in racing came with the Norton-based trainer Malcolm Jefferson, who despite being better known as a trainer of National Hunt horses, gave Hanagan his first racecourse ride on Stone Beck at Haydock Park on 4 September 1998, finishing 4th. A year later and on the recommendation from Jefferson that he should join a flat yard, Hanagan joined the growing yard of Malton-based handler Richard Fahey as an apprentice jockey. == Champion apprentice == Four years into a burgeoning career that had seen Hanagan register scores of 6, 23, and 29 in 1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively, Hanagan became British flat racing Champion Apprentice in 2002, recording an impressive tally of 81 winners, the second- highest total for a champion apprentice in the post-war era behind Lee Newman, the 2000 champion with 87 winners. In an interview immediately after winning the apprentice championship, Hanagan was quick to praise his boss Richard Fahey: \\"The title was my aim at the start of the year‚Ä¶I‚Äôm very grateful for all the help and support I‚Äôve received from everyone, especially from Richard Fahey. Without him, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today.\\" The 2002 season also saw Hanagan record the biggest win of his career at the time on Vintage Premium in the John Smith's Cup at York, leading trainer Richard Fahey to comment \\"If this boy is not champion jockey one day I will give up the game.\\" == Maiden century == In 2004, Hanagan recorded his maiden century of winners, which had been one of his career ambitions when setting out as a young apprentice. His wins that year included victory in the historic Northumberland Plate at Newcastle on Mirjan, which came as a massive boost to Hanagan, who days earlier had incurred a 28-day ban at the Jockey Club for repeatedly not riding to his draw in races. 2004 represented another milestone for Hanagan, as he broke through the ¬£1 million barrier for the first time. == Champion jockey == Though his main patron Richard Fahey had predicted big things for Paul Hanagan following his champion apprentice title in 2002, the challenge of becoming champion jockey for a northern-based jockey was a significant one, with just two other northern-based riders picking up the title in over a century (Elijah Wheatley in 1905 and Kevin Darley in 2000). However, benefiting from the increasing strength of the Fahey stable, Hanagan started the 2010 campaign with four winners on the opening day and was never headed in the race to the title, finishing with 191 winners from over 1,100 rides. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph shortly after being crowned champion jockey on 6 November 2010, Hanagan, who had been cheered on his return to the weighing room by both his colleagues and members of the public, said: \\"I‚Äôm gobsmacked to be honest. I owe the boss [Richard Fahey] so much, I've been with him for 14 years and I owe him a lot. It sounds great being champion jockey, I think it will take a while to sink in.\\" Hanagan's Championship season was enhanced by the top-class two-year-old Wootton Bassett, who finished the season unbeaten in five starts, the last four of those under Hanagan. These victories included major sales races at York and Doncaster, but most importantly a win in the Group 1 Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re at Longchamp, providing Hanagan with the first top-level success of his career. Though Wootton Bassett was unable to add to those successes at three and was retired to stud at the end of the 2011 campaign, he had played an important part in Hanagan's career. == 2011 == A year after defeating Richard Hughes in the 2010 flat jockeys championship, Hanagan was successful in his defence of the title, beating the Brazilian jockey Silvestre De Sousa in a title race that once again went down to the very last day of the season. Hanagan finished the season with 165 winners, 4 clear of De Sousa, and described the feeling of retaining the title as \\"a big relief\\". However, after winning two titles in a row, Hanagan hinted in a Channel 4 interview that he would not be challenging for the title in 2012, claiming \\"I've got to take a step back. I can't keep going on like this or I won't last long.\\" Hanagan became the first northern-based jockey ever to win the flat championship more than once, and having initially suggested he would not go all out for a third title in a row in 2012, he suggested in late November 2011 that, while he wanted to focus on riding a better quality of horse, he may try to retain the championship, saying \\"If I can recharge the batteries and have a good rest then I might think 'well I might give it a good go... I say [I won't go for it again] every time but they ask you the question straight after you get off the horse ‚Äì it's the worst possible time to ask.\\" ==2012 onwards== His hopes of a third title did not materialise, and he finished fifth in the jockeys' championships of both 2012 and 2013, dropping out of the top 5 completely in 2014. == Major wins == Great Britain * British Champions Sprint Stakes ‚Äì (1) ‚Äì Muhaarar (2015) * Eclipse Stakes ‚Äì (1) ‚Äì Mukhadram (2014) * July Cup ‚Äì (2) ‚Äì Mayson (2011), Muhaarar (2015) * King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes ‚Äì (1) ‚Äì Taghrooda (2014) * Oaks Stakes ‚Äì (1) ‚Äì Taghrooda (2014) France * Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re ‚Äì (1) ‚Äì Wootton Bassett (2010) * Prix Maurice de Gheest ‚Äì (1) ‚Äì Muhaarar (2015) UAE * Dubai Golden Shaheen ‚Äì (1) Muarrab (2016) == References == Category:Living people Category:1980 births Category:English jockeys Category:Lester Award winners Category:British Champion flat jockeys Category:British Champion apprentice jockeys ","title":"Paul Hanagan"},{"id":"35332764","text":"Argyresthia plicipunctella is a species of moth of the family Yponomeutidae.

St George's Church is in Castle Street, Kendal, Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Oswald, Burneside, St John, Grayrigg, St Mary, Longsleddale, St Thomas, Selside, and St John the Baptist, Skelsmergh, to form the Beacon Team Ministry. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. ==History== The church originated from a chapel of ease to Kendal Parish Church in 1754. This was located in a two-storey building in Kirkgate; the chapel occupied the upper storey, the ground floor was the butter market, and the basement was used as the gaol. The chapel closed when the present church was built in Castle Street. This was built between 1838 and 1841 to a design by the local architect George Webster. A grant of ¬£4,242 () was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. Between 1910 and 1914 a chancel, organ chamber and vestries were added, which had been designed by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley in 1904. Originally at the west end of the church were twin octagonal towers with spires, the towers being high, but there were problems with their foundations. The towers were shortened in 1927, and in 1978 were reduced again, this time to the same height as the roof of the nave. In 1963 the two western bays were partitioned to create a side chapel and a meeting room. The galleries at the sides of the church were removed, and the west gallery was converted into a hall in the upper storey. In 2004 a narthex, flanked by two small pavilions, was built at the west end to provide a new entrance and toilets. ==Architecture== Webster's nave and tower bases are constructed in limestone and are in Early English style with thin lancet windows and buttresses. The chancel added by Austin and Paley is in sandstone, its style being Decorated. Inside the church, the wooden pulpit stands on columns of Peterhead granite, and the lectern is in the form of an eagle. The furnishings in the chancel are by Austin and Paley. The sanctuary is floored with Carrara marble and Crinoidal limestone from Dent. To the south of the chancel is a transept containing the choir and clergy vestries. The three-manual pipe organ was made in 1883 by the local organ builders Wilkinson and Sons. Originally housed in the south gallery, it was moved to the north organ chamber in 1911 by the same firm. In 1983 it was restored by Rushworth and Dreaper. ==See also== *List of Commissioners' churches in Northeast and Northwest England *List of works by George Webster *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895‚Äì1914) ==References== Kendal Category:Diocese of Carlisle Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Cumbria Category:Austin and Paley buildings Category:Kendal Category:George Webster church buildings ","title":"St George's Church, Kendal"},{"id":"35332820","text":"Osei Kyei Mensa Bonsu (born 3 February 1957) is a Ghanaian urban planner and politician.

Osei was elected as the member of parliament for the Suame constituency of the Ashanti Region of Ghana in the 2004 Ghanaian general elections. He won on the ticket of the New Patriotic Party. His constituency was a part of the 36 parliamentary seats out of 39 seats won by the New Patriotic Party in that election for the Ashanti Region. The New Patriotic Party won a majority total of 128 parliamentary seats out of 230 seats. He was elected with 48,500 votes out of 59,039 total valid votes cast. This was equivalent to 82.1% of total valid votes cast.

He suggested the building be named after the first speaker of Ghana's fourth parliament, Justice D. F. Annan, to honour the contribution he made towards the development of parliamentary affairs and democracy in Ghana. He also proposed that one of the two new blocks built behind the main Job 600 be named after Peter Ala Adjetey, who succeeded Justice Annan. Opposition to these naming issues was led by members of the Convention People's Party, who believed renaming Job 600 would erase the contributions of Kwame Nkrumah from Ghanaian history. == Personal Life == Osei is married with eight children.

Kubinger (born May 25, 1949 in Vienna, Austria), is a psychologist as well as a statistician, professor for psychological assessment at the University of Vienna, Faculty of Psychology. His main research work focuses on fundamental research of assessment processes and on application and advancement of Item response theory models (Rasch model). He is also known as a textbook author of psychological assessment on the one hand and on statistics on the other hand. ==Biography== Kubinger received 1973 the doctor's degree in psychology (PhD) in Vienna, Austria, and became assistant professor. In 1985 he achieved the postdoctoral lecture qualification of psychology. Since then he is head of the examination subject psychological assessment at the University of Vienna. In 1989 he was graduated as a MSc in statistics. In 1998 he was promoted to a full professor of psychological assessment. From this time on, he is head of the division of psychological assessment and applied psychomterics, which includes a Center of Testing and Consulting. In 1997 he earned the qualification of a systemic psych-therapist. ==Scientific Work== The beginning of Klaus Kubinger's carrier was characterized by applications of the Rasch model (Item response theory) on pertinent psychological tests .Kubinger, K.D., Formann, A.K. & Farkas M.G.

A Dolby 361 A-type noise reduction module. In music, noise is variously described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise is an important component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes. The influence of modernism in the early 20th century lead composers such as Edgard Var√®se to explore the use of noise-based sonorities in an orchestral setting. In the same period the Italian Futurist Luigi Russolo created a \\"noise orchestra\\" using instruments he called intonarumori. Later in the 20th century the term noise music came to refer to works consisting primarily of noise-based sound. In more general usage, noise is any unwanted sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds that would be perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver.Attali 1985, 27. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres. ==Definition of noise== In conventional musical practices sounds that are considered unmusical tend to be treated as noise.Scholes 1970, 10, 686. Oscillations and Waves defines noise as irregular vibrations of an object, in contrast to the periodical, patterned structure of music.Reddy, Badami, Balasubramanian 1994, 206. More broadly, electrical engineering professor Bart Kosko in the introductory chapter of his book Noise defines noise as a \\"signal we don't like.\\"Kosko 2006, 3. Paul Hegarty, a lecturer and noise musician, likewise assigns a subjective value to noise, writing that \\"noise is a judgment, a social one, based on unacceptability, the breaking of norms and a fear of violence.\\"Hegarty 2006. Composer and music educator R. Murray Schafer divided noise into four categories: Unwanted noise, unmusical sound, any loud system, and a disturbance in any signaling system.Kouvaras 2013, 54. In regard to what is noise as opposed to music, Robert Fink in The Origin of Music: A Theory of the Universal Development of Music claims that while cultural theories view the difference between noise and music as purely the result of social forces, habit, and custom, \\"everywhere in history we see man making some selections of some sounds as noise, certain other sounds as music, and in the overall development of all cultures, this distinction is made around the same sounds.\\"Fink 1981, 25. However, musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that \\"The border between music and noise is always culturally defined‚Äîwhich implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no single and intercultural universal concept defining what music might be.\\"Nattiez 1990, 48, 55. ==Noise as a feature of music== Musical tones produced by the human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees. Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of f, v, s, z, both voiced and unvoiced th, Scottish and German ch) are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise free. Wind instruments include the whizzing or hissing sounds of air breaking against the edges of the mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what is perceived as a poor tone. When they are not excessive, listeners \\"make themselves deaf\\" to these noises by ignoring them.Helmholtz 1885, 67‚Äì68. Unpitched percussion Maracas owe their distinctive tone to the noise in their sound Many unpitched percussion instruments, such as the snare drum or maracas, make use of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch.Maconie 2005, 84.Hopkin 1996, 2, 92. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren. Traditional music Antiquity Although percussion instruments were generally rather unimportant in ancient Greek music, two exceptions were in dance music and ritual music of orgiastic cults. The former required instruments providing a sharply defined rhythm, particularly krotala (clappers with a dry, nonresonant sound) and kymbala (similar to finger-cymbals). The cult rituals required more exciting noises, such as those produced by drums, cymbals, jingles, and the rhombos (bull-roarer), which produced a demonic roaring noise particularly important to the ceremonies of the priests of Cybele.Mathiesen 2001; West 1992, 122. Athenaeus (The Deipnosophists xiv.38) quotes a passage from a now-lost play, Semele, by Diogenes the Tragedian, describing an all-percussion accompaniment to some of these rites: :And now I hear the turban-wearing women, :Votaries of th' Asiatic Cybele, :The wealthy Phrygians' daughters, loudly sounding :With drums, and rhombs, and brazen- clashing cymbals, :Their hands in concert striking on each other, :Pour forth a wise and healing hymn to the gods.Athenaeus 1854, 3:1015. An altogether darker picture of the function of this noise music is painted by Livy in Ab urbe condita xxxix.8‚Äì10, written in the late first century BC. He describes \\"a Greek of mean condition ... a low operator in sacrifices, and a soothsayer ... a teacher of secret mysteries\\" who imported to Etruria and then to Rome a Dionysian cult which attracted a large following. All manner of debaucheries were practised by this cult, including rape and Polynesia A Tahitian traditional dance genre dating back to before the first contact with European explorers is  ª≈çte ªa, danced by a group of men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble. The drums consist of a slit-log drum called t≈ç‚Äòere (which provides the main rhythmic pattern), a single-headed upright drum called fa‚Äòatete, a single-headed hand drum called pahu tupa‚Äòi rima, and a double-headed bass drum called tariparau.Stillman 2001. Traditional Yangge dance performances are accompanied by unpitched percussion ensembles (Dream Butterfly Dance Group (Ëù∂Ê¢¶ËàûÂõ¢) pictured here). Asia In Shaanxi in the north of China, drum ensembles accompany yangge dance, and in the Tianjin area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the Fagu hui Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens of musicians.Jones 2001. In Korea, a style of folk music called Nongak (farmers' music) or pungmul has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It is loud music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as the drums called janggu and puk, and the gongs ching and kkwaenggwari. It originated in simple work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.Provine 2001. Ensemble of chenda and elathalam performers South Asian music places a special emphasis on drumming, which is freed from the primary time-keeping function of drumming found in other part of the world.Qureshi, et al. 2001, ¬ßI, 2 (i) In North India, secular processional bands play an important role in civic festival parades and the bƒÅrƒÅt processions leading a groom's wedding party to the bride's home or the hall where a wedding is held. These bands vary in makeup, depending on the means of the families employing them and according to changing fashions over time, but the core instrumentation is a small group of percussionists, usually playing a frame drum (·∏çaphalƒÅ), a gong, and a pair of kettledrums (nagƒÅ·πõƒÅ). Better-off families will add shawms (shehnai) to the percussion, while the most affluent who also prefer a more modern or fashionable image may replace the traditional ensemble with a brass band.Qureshi, et al. 2001, ¬ßVII, 1, (d) The Karnatic music of southern India includes a tradition of instrumental temple music in the state of Kerala, called k·π£ƒìtram vƒÅdyam. It includes three main genres, all focussed on rhythm and featuring unpitched percussion. Thayambaka in particular is a virtuoso genre for unpitched percussion only: a solo double-headed cylindrical drum called chenda, played with a pair of sticks, and accompanied by other chenda and elathalam (pairs of cymbals). The other two genres, panchavadyam and pandi melam add wind instruments to the ensemble, but only as accompaniment to the primary drums and cymbals. A panchavadyam piece typically lasts about an hour, while a pandi melam performance may be as long as four hours.Qureshi, et al. 2001, ¬ßVII, 2, (ii), (a). Turkey Turkish mehter√¢n, or janissary band The Turkish janissaries military corps had included since the 14th century bands called mehter or mehter√¢n which, like many other earlier military bands in Asia featured a high proportion of drums, cymbals, and gongs, along with trumpets and shawms. The high level of noise was pertinent to their function of playing on the battlefield to inspire the soldiers.Pirker 2001. The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full mehter√¢n could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of cymbals, small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more Turkish crescents.Blades 1996, 265. Europe Through Turkish ambassadorial visits and other contacts, Europeans gained a fascination with the \\"barbarous\\", noisy sound of these bands, and a number of European courts established \\"Turkish\\" military ensembles in the late-17th and early 18th centuries. The music played by these ensembles, however, were not authentically Turkish music, but rather compositions in the prevalent European manner.Meyer 1974, 484‚Äì85. The general enthusiasm quickly spread to opera and concert orchestras, where the combination of bass drum, cymbals, tambourines, and triangles were collectively referred to as \\"Turkish music\\". The best-known examples include Haydn's Symphony No. 100, which acquired its nickname, \\"The Military\\", from its use of these instruments, and three of Beethoven's works: the \\"alla marcia\\" section from the finale of his Symphony No. 9 (an early sketch reads: \\"end of the Symphony with Turkish music\\"), his \\"Wellington's Victory\\"‚Äîor Battle Symphony‚Äîwith picturesque sound effects (the bass drums are designated as \\"cannons\\", side drums represent opposing troops of soldiers, and ratchets the sound of rifle fire), and the \\"Turkish March\\" (with the expected bass drum, cymbals, and triangle) and the \\"Chorus of Dervishes\\" from his incidental music to The Ruins of Athens, where he calls for the use of every available noisy instrument: castanets, cymbals, and so forth.Blades 1996, 266‚Äì67.Montagu 2002, 108‚Äì10.Sachs 2010, 65. By the end of the 18th century, the batterie turque had become so fashionable that keyboard instruments were fitted with devices to simulate the bass drum (a mallet with a padded head hitting the back of the sounding board), cymbals (strips of brass striking the lower strings), and the triangle and bells (small metal objects struck by rods). Even when percussion instruments were not actually employed, certain alla turca \\"tricks\\" were used to imitate these percussive effects. Examples include the \\"Rondo alla turca\\" from Mozart's Piano Sonata, K. 331, and part of the finale of his Violin Concerto, K. 219.Meyer 1974, 486‚Äì87. =Harpsichord, piano, and organ= leftthumb Giuseppe Verdi, who used noise in the form of a tone cluster in Otello. At about the same time that \\"Turkish music\\" was coming into vogue in Europe, a fashion for programmatic keyboard music opened the way for the introduction of another kind of noise in the form of the keyboard cluster, played with the fist, flat of the hand, forearm, or even an auxiliary object placed on the keyboard. On the harpsichord and piano, this device was found mainly in \\"battle\\" pieces, where it was used to represent cannon fire. The earliest instance was by Jean- Fran√ßois Dandrieu, in Les Caract√®res de la guerre (1724), and for the next hundred years it remained predominantly a French feature, with examples by Michel Corrette (La Victoire d'un combat naval, remport√©e par une fr√©gate contre plusieurs corsaires r√©unis, 1780), Claude-B√©nigne Balbastre (March des Marseillois, 1793), Pierre Antoine C√©sar (La Battaille de Gemmap, ou la prise de Mons, ca. 1794), and Jacques-Marie Beauvarlet-Charpentier (Bataille d'Austerlitz, 1805). In 1800, Bernard Viguerie introduced the sound to chamber music, in the keyboard part of a piano trio titled La Bataille de Maringo, pi√®ce militaire et historique.Henck 2004, 32‚Äì50. The last time this pianistic \\"cannon\\" effect was used before the 20th century was in 1861, in a depiction of the then-recent The Battle of Manassas in a piece by the black American piano virtuoso \\"Blind Tom\\" Bethune, a piece that also feature vocalised sound- effect noises.Gates and Higginbotham 2004, 85. Clusters were also used on the organ, where they proved more versatile (or their composers more imaginative). Their most frequent use on this instrument was to evoke the sound of thunder, but also to portray sounds of battle, storms at sea, earthquakes, and Biblical scenes such as the fall of the walls of Jericho and visions of the apocalypse. The noisy sound nevertheless remained a special sound effect, and was not integrated into the general texture of the music. The earliest examples of \\"organ thunder\\" are from descriptions of improvisations by Abb√© Vogler in the last quarter of the 18th century. His example was soon imitated by Justin Heinrich Knecht (Die durch ein Donerwetter unterbrochne Hirtenwonne, 1794), Michel Corrette (who employed a length of wood on the pedal board and his elbow on the lowest notes of the keyboard during some improvisations), and also in composed works by Guillaume Lasceux (Te Deum: \\"Judex crederis\\", 1786), Sigismond Neukomm (A Concert on a Lake, Interrupted by a Thunderstorm), Louis James Alfred Lef√©bure-W√©ly (Sc√®ne pastorale, 1867), Jacques Vogt (Fantaisie pastorale et orage dans les Alpes, ca. 1830), and Jules Blanc (La procession, 1859).Henck 2004, 41‚Äì45. The most notable 19th-composer to use such organ clusters was Giuseppe Verdi. The storm music which opens his opera Otello (1887) includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that is also the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture.Henck 2004, 56; Kimbell 1991, 606. =Bowed strings= Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber introduced noises into string music for programmatic effects Percussive effects in imitation of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of col legno (tapping on the strings with the back of the bow) is found in Tobias Hume's First Part of Ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba (1605), in a piece titled Harke, Harke.Walls 2001, ¬ß2 xi. Carlo Farina, an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used col legno to mimic the sound of a drum in his Capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as glissando, tremolo, pizzicato, and sul ponticello to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken).Newman 1972, 207; Pyron and Bianco 2001. Later in the century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, in certain movements of Battalia (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry rattle of a snare drum, and in \\"Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor\\" from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive snap of fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots.Arnold 1994, 54. An important aspect of all of these examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as at the same time they became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.Arnold 1994, 56‚Äì57. =Orchestras= Orchestras continued to use noise in the form of a percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of timpani.Hast, Cowdery, and Scott 1999, 149. However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums. =Vocal music= In vocal music, noisy nonsense syllables were used to imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Cl√©ment Janequin made these devices famous in his programmatic chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528.Arnold 1994, 53. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in the first version of his melodrama, K√∂nigskinder. This style of performance is believed to have been used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900‚Äì11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930‚Äì32), and for chorus in Die Gl√ºckliche Hand (1910‚Äì13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977‚Äì78, amongst other works).Griffiths 2001. A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady.Kennedy 2006. Another form of unpitched vocal music is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.Oechsler 2001. =Machine music= Edgard Var√®se, who explored noise in an orchestral setting. In the 1920s a fashion emerged for composing what was called \\"machine music\\"‚Äîthe depiction in music of the sounds of factories, locomotives, steamships, dynamos, and other aspects of recent technology that both reflected modern, urban life and appealed to the then-prevalent spirit of objectivity, detachment, and directness. Representative works in this style, which features motoric and insistent rhythms, a high level of dissonance, and often large percussion batteries, are George Antheil's Ballet m√©canique (1923‚Äì25), Arthur Honegger's Pacific 231 (1923), Sergei Prokofiev's ballet Le pas d'acier (The Steel Leap, 1925‚Äì26), Alexander Mosolov's Iron Foundry (an orchestral episode from his ballet Steel, 1926‚Äì27), and Carlos Ch√°vez's ballet Caballos de vapor, also titled HP (Horsepower, 1926‚Äì32). This trend reached its apex in the music of Edgard Var√®se, who composed Ionisation in 1931, a \\"study in pure sonority and rhythm\\" for an ensemble of thirty-five unpitched percussion instruments.Machlis 1979, 154‚Äì56, 357. =Percussion ensembles= Following Var√®se's example, a number of other important works for percussion ensemble were composed in the 1930s and 40s: Henry Cowell's Ostinato Pianissimo (1934) combines Latin American, European, and Asian percussion instruments; John Cage's First Construction (in Metal) (1939) employs differently pitched thunder sheets, brake drums, gongs, and a water gong; Carlos Ch√°vez's Toccata for percussion instruments (1942) requires six performers to play a large number of European and Latin-American drums and other unpitched percussion together with a few tuned instruments such as xylophone, tubular chimes, and glockenspiel; Lou Harrison, in works such as the Canticles nos. 1 and 3 (1940 and 1942), Song of Queztalcoatl (1941), Suite for Percussion (1942), and‚Äîin collaboration with John Cage‚ÄîDouble Music (1941) explored the use of \\"found\\" instruments, such as brake drums, flowerpots, and metal pipes. In all of these works, elements such as timbre, texture, and rhythm take precedence over the usual Western concepts of harmony and melody.Miller and Hanson 2001; Holland and Page 2001. Experimental and avant-garde music Prepared piano Use of noise was central to the development of experimental music and avant-garde music in the mid 20th century. Noise was used in important, new ways. Edgard Var√®se challenged traditional conceptions of musical and non-musical sound and instead incorporated noise based sonorities into his compositional work, what he referred to as \\"organised sound.\\"Goldman 1961. Var√®se stated that \\"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called noise\\", and he posed the question, \\"what is music but organized noises?\\".Var√®se and Chou 1966, 18. In the years immediately following the First World War, Henry Cowell composed a number of piano pieces featuring tone clusters and direct manipulation of the piano's strings. One of these, titled The Banshee (1925), features sliding and shrieking sounds suggesting the terrifying cry of the banshee from Irish folklore.Simms 1986, 317. In 1938 for a dance composition titled Bacchanale, John Cage invented the prepared piano, producing both transformed pitches and colorful unpitched sounds from the piano.Simms 1986, 319‚Äì20. Many variations, such as prepared guitar, have followed.Rhodes and Westwood 2008, 184. In 1952, Cage wrote 4‚Ä≤33‚Ä≥, in which there is no deliberate sound at all, but only whatever background noise occurs during the performance. Karlheinz Stockhausen employed noise in vocal compositions, such as Momente (1962‚Äì64/69), in which the four choirs clap their hands, talk, and shuffle their feet, in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds as well as to incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers.Simms 1986, 374. Robert Ashley used audio feedback in his avant-garde piece The Wolfman (1964) by setting up a howl between the microphone and loudspeaker and then singing into the microphone in way that modulated the feedback with his voice. Electronic music Roland System-100M modular synthesizer with ring modulator, noise generator, sample & hold, LFO Some of the Minimoog Voyager controls. Note the NOISE/PGM option on the top rotary switches controlling the modulation busses. Noise is used as basic tonal material in electronic music. When pure-frequency sine tones were first synthesised into complex timbres, starting in 1953, combinations using inharmonic relationships (noises) were used far more often than harmonic ones (tones).Stockhausen 1963b, 142 and 144. Tones were seen as analogous to vowels, and noises to consonants in human speech, and because traditional music had emphasised tones almost exclusively, composers of electronic music saw scope for exploration along the continuum stretching from single, pure (sine) tones to white noise (the densest superimposition of all audible frequencies)‚Äîthat is, from entirely periodic to entirely aperiodic sound phenomena. In a process opposite to the building up of sine tones into complexes, white noise could be filtered to produce sounds with different bandwidths, called \\"coloured noises\\", such as the speech sounds represented in English by sh, f, s, or ch. An early example of an electronic composition composed entirely by filtering white noise in this way is Henri Pousseur's Scambi (Exchanges), realised at the Studio di Fonologia in Milan in 1957.Stockhausen 1963b, 144‚Äì45. In the 1980s, electronic white noise machines became commercially available.Anon. n.d. These are used alone to provide a pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music.Heller 2003, 197. This usage can have health applications in the case of individuals struggling with over-stimulation or sensory processing disorder.Fast 2004, 233. Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.Hessler and Lehner 2008, 72. Rock music Ibanez Tube Screamer TS9, an example of an overdrive pedal While the electric guitar was originally designed to be simply amplified in order to reproduce its sound at a higher volume,Bacon 1981, 142. guitarists quickly discovered the creative possibilities of using the amplifier to modify the sound, particularly by extreme settings of tone and volume controls.Bacon 1981, 119 Distortion was at first produced by simply overloading the amplifier to induce clipping, resulting in a tone rich in harmonics and also in noise, and also producing dynamic range compression and therefore sustain (and sometimes destroying the amplifier). Dave Davies of The Kinks took this technique to its logical conclusion by feeding the output from a 60 watt guitar amplifier directly into the guitar input of a second amplifier.Piccola 2009. The popularity of these techniques quickly resulted in the development of electronic devices such as the fuzz box to produce similar but more controlled effects and in greater variety. Distortion devices also developed into vocal enhancers, effects units that electronically enhance a vocal performance, including adding air (noise or distortion, or both).Maserati 2012. Guitar distortion is often accomplished through use of feedback, overdrive, fuzz, and distortion pedals.Bennett 2002, 43. Distortion pedals produce a crunchier and grittier tone than an overdrive pedal. As well as distortion, rock musicians have used audio feedback, which is normally undesirable.Madden 1999, 92.Holmes 2008, 186. The use of feedback was pioneered by musicians such as John Lennon of The Beatles,MacDonald 2005, 136‚Äì37.Shea and Rodriguez 2007, 173. Jeff Beck of The Yardbirds, Pete Townshend of The Who, and Jimi Hendrix.Coelho 2003, 116. Hendrix was able to control feedback and turn it into a musical quality,Martin and Waters 2011, 323. and his use of noise has been described as \\"sculpted ‚Äì liquid and fire expertly shaped in mid-air as if by a glass blower.\\"Stubbs 2003, 6. Other techniques used by Hendrix include distortion, wah, fuzz, dissonance, and loud volume.Candelaria and Kingman 2011, 130. Jazz In the mid-1960s, jazz began incorporating elements of rock music,Kirchner 2005, 505. and began using distortion and feedback,Dunscomb and Hill 2002, 233. partially due to the efforts of Jimi Hendrix,Alexander 2003, 132‚Äì33.Bush 2005, 72. who had strong links with jazz.Sallis 1996, 155. The proto-punk band MC5 also used feedback and loudness and was inspired by the avant-garde jazz movement. Jazz musicians who have incorporated noise elements, feedback and distortion include Bill Frisell,Ake 2002, 169‚Äì170 David KrakauerBerendt, Huesmann 2009, 1881. Cecil Taylor,Dicaire 2006, 233.

Hip hop  Public Enemy, supported by The Bomb Squad, used noise to make political statements through music, and influenced a decade of hip hop and rock. Since its origins in the Bronx during the 1970s, hip hop music has been associated with noise. According to author Mark Katz techniques such as scratching are an expression of transgression where scratching, like the visual art of graffiti, is a form of vandalism.Katz 2012, 66. \\"It is a celebration of noise,\\" writes Katz, \\"and no doubt part of the pleasure it brought to DJs came from the knowledge that it annoyed the older generation.\\" Scholar William Jelani Cobb states that \\"though the genre will always be dismissed by many as brash, monotonous noise, the truth is that hip hop has undergone an astounding array of lyrical and musical transformations.\\"Cobb 2007, 84. Scholar Ronald Radano writes that \\"no term in the modern lexicon conveys more vividly African-American music's powers of authenticity and resistance than the figure of 'noise'. In hip-hop parlance, 'noise,' specifically 'black noise', is that special insight from the inside, the anti-philosophy that emerges front and center through the sound attack of rap.\\"Radano 2000, 39. Radano finds the appearance of \\"black noise\\" nearly everywhere in the \\"transnational repetitions of rap opposition,\\" but stresses that despite its global nature, black noise still conforms to American racial structures. Radano states that \\"rather than radicalizing the stable binaries of race, noise inverts them; it transforms prior signs of European musical mastery ‚Äî harmony, melody, song ‚Äî into all that is bitchin', kickin', and black.\\" The hip hop group Public Enemy in particular has been noted for its use of noise in its music. The group's second album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), was backed by the production team The Bomb Squad, who helped craft the album's layered, anti-harmonic, anarchic noise.Cobb 2007, 57.Strong 2002, 854. Michael Eric Dyson describes the album as a \\"powerful mix of music, beats, screams, noise, and rhythms from the streets\\", and considers it an example of the revival of black radical and nationalist thought.Dyson 1993, 13. Public Enemy member Chuck D acknowledges that the group's use of noise was an intentional attempt to blur the boundaries between popular music and the noise of everyday life, a decision which writer Jason W. Buel says \\"ran directly counter to the values of mainstream music of the time.\\"Buel 2013, 118, 120. He explains that \\"without a doubt\\" this intentional use of noise influenced not only the next decade of hip-hop, but of rock as well. Furthermore, notes Buel, the incorporation of noise served a political function, elevating the ordinary and thus suggesting that common, ordinary people should consider themselves on the same footing as their political and cultural leaders. ==Noise as a type of music== Construction drawing for one of Russolo's intonarumori Japanoise band The Boredoms Noise music (also referred to simply as noise) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently. Some of its proponents reject the attempt to classify it as a single overall genre,\\"With the vast growth of Japanese noise, finally, noise music becomes a genre‚Äîa genre that is not one, to paraphrase Luce Irigaray\\" (Hegarty 2007, 133). preferring to call noise music a non-genre, an aesthetic, or a collection of genres. Even among those who regard it as a genre, its scope is unclear.Wolf 2009, 67: \\"The genre noise music does not have a proper definition\\". Some commentators use the phrase \\"noise music\\" (or \\"noise\\") to refer specifically to Japanese noise music, while others instead use the term Japanoise.Minor 2004, 291.Gottlieb and McLelland 2003, 60. While noise music is often nowadays associated with extreme volume and distortionPiekut 2011, 193. and produced by electronic amplification, the tradition dates back at least to the Futurist Luigi Russolo,Russolo 1913. who rejected melody, constructed original instruments known as intonarumori and assembled a \\"noise orchestra\\" in 1917. It was not well received.Hegarty 2007, 13‚Äì14. In his 1913 manifesto The Art of Noises he observes: > At first the art of music sought purity, limpidity and sweetness of sound. > Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress > the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more > complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh > sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound. Some types of noise music * Noise music, abandoning melody, harmony, and sometimes even pulse and rhythm * Industrial music (1970s) * Noise rock and noise pop (1980s) * Japanoise (late 1970s ‚Äì current) * Glitch (1990s) ==Noise reduction== Dolby noise-reduction system hardware Most often, musicians are concerned not to produce noise, but to minimise it. Noise reduction is of particular concern in sound recording. This is accomplished by many techniques, including use of low noise components and proprietary noise reducing technologies such as Dolby.Dolby Laboratories n.d. In both recording and in live musical sound reinforcement, the key to noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low,Amyes 1998, 60.Self 2011, 417. or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson‚ÄìNyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high.Self 2011, 411‚Äì29, 510‚Äì11. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in recording and in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance can be used as a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.Kosko, Mitaim 1998, 2152. Noise created by mobile phones has become a particular concern in live performances, particularly those being recorded. In one notable incident, maestro Alan Gilbert halted the New York Philharmonic in a performance of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 9 until an audience member's iPhone was silenced. ==Noise as excessive volume== Music played at excessive volumes is often considered a form of noise pollution.Avison 1989, 469. Governments such as that of the United Kingdom have local procedures for dealing with noise pollution, including loud music.Directgov Noise as high volume is common for musicians from classical orchestras to rock groups as they are exposed to high decibel ranges.Jansson and Karlsson 1983.Maia and Russo 2008, 49. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music,Anon. 2006. it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments.Ostri, Eller, Dahlin, and Skylv 1989, pp. 243‚Äì49 Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers.Morata 2007. While some studies have shown that the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two. In 2008 Trygve Nordwall, the manager of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, invoked new EU rules forbidding more than 85 decibels in the workplace, as a reason for dropping the planned world premiere of Dror Feiler's composition Halat Hisar (State of Siege) because it was \\"adverse to the health\\" of the musicians. The twenty-minute composition \\"starts with the rattle of machine-gun fire and gets louder\\"Connolly 2008. (\\"Das St√ºck beginnt mit Sch√ºssen aus Maschinengewehren, die vom Band zugespielt werden, und das ist noch die leiseste Stelle.\\")Anon. 2008. Orchestra manager Trygve Nordwall reported that \\"readings were taken during rehearsals and even when toned down, Halat Hisar measured about 130 decibels, equivalent to hearing a jet aircraft taking off\\", and one member of the orchestra reported suffering headaches and permanent tinnitis after sustained exposure for three hours during rehearsals (\\"Ein Orchestermusiker habe nach der Probe des St√ºckes drei Stunden lang permanente Ohrger√§usche (Tinnitus) gehabt\\"). Headphones for the musicians were suggested, but they objected they could not hear each other and the composer also rejected the idea, adding that his composition was \\"no louder than anything by Shostakovich or Wagner\\". Many bands, primarily in the rock genre, use excessive volumes intentionally. Several bands have set records as the loudest band in the world, with Deep Purple, The Who, and Manowar having received entries in the Guinness Book of World Records.Ankeny n.d.Anon. 2009. Other claimants to the title include Mot√∂rhead,Cohen 1986, 36. Led Zeppelin,Kreps 2009. Gallows,Dan 2007. Bob Dylan's 1965 backing electric band,Unterberger 2002, xiii. Grand Funk Railroad,James 1999, 30. Canned Heat,De la Parra 2000, . and the largely fictional parody group Spinal Tap.McCreadie 2009, 153. My Bloody Valentine are known for their \\"legendarily high\\" volume concerts,Hughey 2009. and Sunn O))) are described as surpassing them.Turner 2009. The sound levels at Sunn O))) concerts are intentionally loud enough that they are noted for having physical effects on their audience.Battaglia 2009.Economy 2004. ==See also== Noise in general * Noise (disambiguation) for a list of other articles related to noise * Noise (electronics) Relating noise to music * The definition of music, detailed discussions * Phonaesthetics for the aesthetics of sound, and particularly what is meant by cacophony * Aesthetics of music * Inharmonicity, one of the factors causing a sound to be perceived as unpitched * Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance for discussion of the nature and usage of discords in melody and harmony and similar devices in rhythm and metre * Timbral listening Related types * Free jazz * Percussion ensemble Related types of music * :Category:Noise music for an automated list of articles related to noise as a type of music ==NotesReferences== *Ake, David Andrew. 2002.

A later variant targeted a Java vulnerability on Mac OS X. The system was infected after the user was redirected to a compromised bogus site, where JavaScript code caused an applet containing an exploit to load. An executable file was saved on the local machine, which was used to download and run malicious code from a remote location. The malware also switched between various servers for optimized load balancing. Each bot was given a unique ID that was sent to the control server. The trojan, however, would only infect the user visiting the infected web page, meaning other users on the computer were not infected unless their user accounts had been infected separately. ==Resolution== Oracle, the company that develops Java, fixed the vulnerability exploited to install Flashback on February 14, 2012. However, at the time of Flashback's release, Apple maintained the Mac OS X version of Java and did not release an update containing the fix until April 3, 2012, after the flaw had already been exploited to install Flashback on 600,000 Macs. On April 12, 2015, the company issued a further update to remove the most common Flashback variants. The updated Java release was only made available for Mac OS X Lion and Mac OS X Snow Leopard; the removal utility was released for Intel versions of Mac OS X Leopard in addition to the two newer operating systems. Users of older operating systems were advised to disable Java. There are also some third party programs to detect and remove the Flashback trojan. Apple worked on a new process that would eventually lead to a release of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Mac OS X at the same time it would be available for Windows, Linux, and Solaris users. As of January 9, 2014, about 22,000 Macs were still infected with the Flashback trojan. ==See also== *Mac Defender *Leap (computer worm) ==References *Apple Delays, Hackers Play April 12, 2012 Category:MacOS malware Category:Trojan horses ","title":"Flashback (Trojan)"},{"id":"35332879","text":"Argyresthia rileiella is a moth of the family Yponomeutidae.

Stephens.Manson (1902), p.11 However, according to the England and Wales Christening Index 1530‚Äì1980, he was born on 23 January 1765 and baptised on 3 February 1765 at Westminster. The son of a jeweller, he was apprenticed to the engraver William Byrne. As a 16 year old apprentice he contributed the frame surrounding a Byrne engraving for the frontispiece of Antiquities of Great Britain: VOL.I., in 1785. A work published in 1786. He then went to work for the publisher Thomas Macklin, noted for his illustrated edition of the Bible. He started a series Views of the Isle of Wight after pictures by Ibbetson and Turner, but publication was halted when he had only executed three plates. His largest series of engravings was Twenty Views of the South of Scotland, after James Moore. Others included one after drawings of animals by Dutch artists, and another of Biblical subjects, after Raphael and others. In 1806, he delivered a series of lectures on engraving at the Royal Institution, in which he defended engraving its status as an independent art, and criticised the issuing of inferior plates by commercially minded publishers. The series was terminated after the sixth lecture, following protests by Josiah Boydell, who claimed that Landseer had unfairly criticised his uncle John Boydell, the leading publisher of engravings, who had died in 1804. He published the lectures in 1807, with added comments reinforcing his criticism of Boydell.Manson (1902), pp.13‚Äì4 Also in 1806, he was elected an Associate Engraver of the Royal Academy despite his dispute with the institution over their failure to admit engravers as full members.Manson (1902), pp.12‚Äì4 He had previously only exhibited there once, in 1792.Stephens (1880), p.7 Some leading engravers ‚Äì including Landseer's teacher, William ByrneStephens (1880), p.3 ‚Äì chose to boycott the academy completely over the issue, but Landseer hoped to challenge its rules from within. His protests, which included petitioning the Prince Regent, proved ineffective however, and the academy's policy was not changed until after his death.Manson (1902), pp.12‚Äì4 In 1813, he lectured at the Surrey Institution on The Philosophy of Art. Henry Crabb Robinson, who heard Landseer speak there, described him as \\"animated in style, but his animation is produced by indulgence in sarcasms, and in emphatic diction.\\"Manson (1902), p.15 For a while he pursued an interest in archaeology, becoming a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and publishing two books on Babylonian antiquities, before returning to engraving. In 1826 he was appointed Engraver to the King, and in 1831 published a plate of Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller after a picture painted by his son Edwin eleven years earlier, at the age of eighteen.Manson (1902), p.15‚Äì6 Landseer died in London on 20 February 1852, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. ==Writings== *Observations on the Engraved Gems brought from Babylon to England by Abraham Lockett Esq, considered with reference to Scripture History (1817).Stephens (1880), p.11 *Sab√¶an History (1823).Stephens (1880), p.12 *Description of Fifty of the Earliest Pictures in the National Gallery (1834; only the first volume was published).Stephens (1880), p.12 He published two short-lived periodicals: The Review of Publications in Art in 1808, and The Probe, set up in opposition to the Art-Union's journal. in 1837.Stephens (1880), p.12 He contributed articles on schools of engraving to Rees's Cyclop√¶dia namely the French school (Volume 15, 1810); the German (Volume 16, 1810), the Low Countries (Volume 21, 1812) and the Italian (Volume 19, 1811).

For a short period he held office as Chief Secretary from 1‚Äì29 March 1887 in Mr James W. Agnew's Administration. It is reported that he contributed materially towards brightening the debates by animated speeches, largely commingled of shrewdness, grasp of facts, and a caustic wit that had nothing spiteful about it. He was a member of the Executive Council, a magistrate of the territory, and visiting justice of the Gaol at Launceston. He was connected with local sporting institutions, was a steward of the Tasmanian Turf Club, and president of a number of athletic clubs He had always taken a deep interest in the volunteer movement, held the long service medal and was captain and paymaster of the Launceston Rifle Corp. ==Family and death== Rooke married twice, firstly to Maria Louisa Ferguson, in 1880, and secondly, in 1892, to his cousin Emma Rooke, daughter of the Hon.

It originally aired on ABC on 7 January 1961. Only about 20 minutes, the first of three acts, remain. The episode was directed by Don Leaver and generally acknowledged to have been written by Ray Rigby, but Brian Clemens claimed to have written it. ==Plot== Dr. David Keel's (Ian Hendry) fianc√©e and surgery receptionist Peggy (Catherine Woodville) is murdered by a ruthless gang of drug dealers. By accident he receives a consignment of heroin at his surgery. Believing it to have been sent by the gang who killed his fiance, he seeks revenge, and with the help of a mysterious figure John Steed (Patrick Macnee) they hunt the gang down. They find the gang leader Spicer and set a trap for him, but he escapes and is finally caught in the next episode. Keel decides he enjoys playing amateur detective, and decides to form a team with Steed. ==Cast== *Ian Hendry as Dr. David H. Keel *Patrick Macnee as John Steed *Philip Stone as Dr. Richard J.

He continued to produce The Avengers and working with Hendry in a whole new concept, with Hendry playing the new character of Dr. David Keel. The episode is usually considered to have been written by Ray Rigby, based on a story by Patrick Brawn; however, in an interview with Wheeler W. Dixon in May 1999, Brian Clemens, the creator of the series, claims to have written it. The episode sets were designed by Alpho O'Reilly. Production by ABC Weekend Television was wrapped up on 30 December 1960. The episode premiered on ABC in the Midlands and North of England on Saturday 7 January 1961 at 10pm. Only the first 20 minutes or so of the first act of the episode survive; the remaining two acts are thought to be lost. The extant footage ends with the sequence in which Keel's fiance Peggy is shot, before the introduction of John Steed. It has been released on DVD as a bonus feature by A&E; Home Video in its Emma Peel Megabox collection, alongside the two complete surviving episodes from Season 1. Catherine Woodville, who plays Dr Keel's fianc√©e, later became Patrick Macnee's second wife. ==Reception== The episode and series is described by Anthony Aldgate as being \\"conceived within the discourse of psychological realism that informed most contemporary television drama. It set up a motivation for the hero-figure of Keel, described by Hendry as 'a most attractive character [who] combines toughness with compassion and serves as the conscience of the team'. Steed, in contrast, is portrayed as a more cynical figure for whom the most obvious influence was James Bond. However, whereas Bond traveled to exotic foreign locations in his pursuit of international super-criminals such as Dr. No or Goldfinger, The Avengers was concerned mainly with home-grown criminals whose ambitions (at least to begin with) were somewhat less grandiose.\\" Toby Miller remarked that \\"Far from being rustic, The Avengers was a landmark in the cultural division of labour\\". The episode has been described as \\"dark, realistic, and, because it was shot on videotape and live-on-camera, very stagy. Its subject matter was most unAvengers like, dealing with drug-smugglers, bereavement, and the seedy underside of British crime.\\" The Avengers Forever! website technically regards the episode as at least as good as any Cathy Gale episode, with some \\"excellent camera work, including very creative special-effects\\", but spotted deficiencies in the \\"repetitive use of certain music cues, and a slightly awkward sequence when Dr Keel's fianc√©e is shot.\\" They remarked that the episode shows a \\"high degree of professionalism and skill: good writing, good acting, great direction (no surprise, really, with Don Leaver at the helm), and, in particular, a fine lead. Ian Hendry demonstrates exactly why Sydney Newman was so very anxious to get him in front of television viewers: he is a natural. His acting is easy, smooth and captivating.\\" ==Other media== In January 2014 Big Finish Productions released an audio adaption of \\"Hot Snow\\" as the first part of a series of audio reconstructions of the missing stories from season 1, following the original scripts as closely as possible. ==References * *Episode overview on The Avengers Forever! website Category:The Avengers (season 1) episodes Category:Lost television episodes ","title":"Hot Snow (The Avengers)"},{"id":"35333207","text":"Robert Alcock (died 1583), of Canterbury and Marden, Kent, was an English politician.

While his elder brother Philip inherited the principality of Grubenhagen from his father, Eric was destined according to the customs of the era for a career in the clergy. After studying in Rome he became canon at the cathedrals in M√ºnster and Paderborn. Eric was elected prince-bishop of Paderborn and Osnabr√ºck and his election was confirmed by Pope Julius II on 20 April 1509. However, Emperor Maximilian I refused to acknowledge him as prince and even outlawed him, because of an outstanding tax debt. Eric received imperial recognition only on 2 April 1521, from Emperor Charles V. The Reformation started during his term in office. However, it hardly affected Eric, neither theologically, nor in his role as worldly ruler. He remained faithful to the Catholic doctrine himself, and did not have any disputes with his Lutheran neighbours, nor with the Lutheran citizens of the cities in his Prince-bishopric. He kept an open mind, and granted many exemptions to the Lutherans in his territory. In the Roman Catholic literature his stance on religious matters is described as ambiguous, because he witnessed the wedding of a former Benedictine nun from Kaufungen. In 1532, Frederick III of Wied resigned as Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster and Eric III was elected as his successor. This would have meant that the three prince- bishoprics in Westphalia would be united in a personal union.

They compete in the National Premier Leagues Western Australia. ==History== In the park of St. Lawrence Church, Main Street, Balcatta, a group of friends started to kick a football to end the boredom of the Sunday afternoons. Little did they know that this was the beginning of Balcatta Etna Soccer Club. Within a short time the number of friends who wanted to play football grew dramatically as did the number of spectators. The much-developed interest between the group of friends brought about the idea of forming a football team, and within several days a committee was formed. The majority of members were originally from a town called Ucria (province of Messina), Sicily. This being the case, it was decided to call the newborn club by a Sicilian symbol ‚ÄúEtna‚Äù being the largest volcano in Europe. After several months of preparation, the club was accepted as a member of the Soccer Federation of Western Australia and became officially known as Balcatta Etna Soccer Club. In the first year, 1978, playing at the new home ground, Reader Reserve in Hector St, Mt Yokine. Etna acquired fifth position on the ladder. In the second year, 1979, Etna finished seventh position on the ladder. In the same year, a ladies committee was formed and a house was rented at 70 McDonald Street, Osborne Park for use as clubrooms. The following year in 1980, a youth committee was formed for the purpose of helping promote the club. The management committee decided to strengthen the team and with the addition of new players, promotion was achieved from 4th to 3rd Division. In 1982 the club amalgamated with the Balcatta Cats Junior Soccer Club, which led to expansion of the club. It was decided that a larger ground was needed to accommodate the increase in numbers and in 1985, the club was granted approval to use Grindleford Reserve (now Graham Burkett Reserve). For the following two years the club maintained a strong position in the senior rankings and the junior teams increased rapidly. In 1987 the management committee decided to amalgamate with Perth Azzuri Soccer Club (now Perth SC) and East Fremantle Tricolore Soccer Club (now Fremantle City Football Club) and after numerous meetings and discussions the Perth Italia Soccer Club was formed. Representatives from all 3 clubs strongly contributed in establishing the finest football facilities in Western Australia at Dorrien Gardens. For the next 3 years, Balcatta Etna did not field any senior teams and concentrated on promoting and improving the junior teams. In 1991, the management committee decided to enter a senior team to play in the Professional Soccer 3rd Division Competition. With the introduction of new coaches, players and an existing strong juniors camp. It was the start of a new era. In 1993 the club took the step in fielding a senior women‚Äôs team. The girls finished the season being runners up in the final of the night series competition, won the Top Four Cup and the Premiership to gain promotion to 1st Division. It was no surprise that in the 1994 season, with so much talent, eleven of the girls were chosen to represent Western Australia in various age groups. However, the clubrooms, which were built on a rubbish dump, were literally sinking into the ground. Walls started to crack and in 1994 discussions commenced with the local council to build new clubrooms. 1994 was a historic year in that the management committee decided to change the club's name to Balcatta Soccer Club. The seniors finished the season in 2nd position and were promoted to the 2nd Division. In 1996, the senior‚Äôs team was promoted to the 1st Division and the committee‚Äôs main goal was to successfully complete the new clubrooms. With the assistance of the local council, club sponsors and dedicated committee members, the new clubrooms were completed and officially opened in 1997. 1998 was the most successful year on the park, with the seniors team qualifying for the semi-finals in the Night Series and achieving runners up in the final of the West Ham United FC Cup. One of the more pleasing aspect of the season was the development of some of the youth introduced to play at senior level. And the results of youth development proved a success when in 1999 the seniors team finished the season in the top five group. With the appointment of a youth development officer in 2000, the club concentrated on improving the soccer skills of their youth players. This would enable the club to be in a position to offer a solid future for soccer within the community. In 2001, a sponsorship committee was formed and a target was set for them to achieve. The target was surpassed with ease and beyond the original expectations. With the continued hard work from the sponsorship committee the club continues to be amongst the top soccer clubs in Western Australia. In 2002, a youth Committee was formed and they organized over 20 Xplosionz Under 18‚Äôs Dance Parties which were very popular and attended by up to 1000 people each month. They not only raised valuable funds for the club, but they also donated over $10,000.00 to Charity, including a live interview on Telethon. In 2006, Elisa D'Ovidio who played for the Premier Women‚Äôs Team in the highest league in Western Australia, won the Fairest & Best in the league and also won the Golden Boot Award for the leading goal scorer. On 17 August 2006 the good work of Balcatta Soccer Club was mentioned several times in Parliament House Canberra in a speech by Federal Member Michael Keenan. In 2013 the club changed its name from Balcatta Soccer Club to Balcatta FC. ==Colours and badge== The major colours for Balcatta are blue and red. The Balcatta FC badge contains three sections.

Guided tours that take about 20 minutes are laid on from Easter to the end of September on Sundays and public holidays. ==Overview== The guided tour leads first along an artificially-created gallery into the cave. Its natural entrance is located above the current man-made entrance and is visible from the present-day pathway. A hut has been built in front of the artificial gallery through which the gallery entrance is accessed. Inside the cave the tour leads initially down a side tunnel and then along the main corridor to the first squeeze. In the hall in front of this constriction, the largest dripstones of the guided tour are to be found - stalagmites about 1 metre high (see illustration). From the fork in the two passageways to this hall the tour follows a passage in which a calc-sinter curtain and several stalactites can be seen hanging from the roof.

Howard Morgan, a retired officer of the Chicago Police Department, was shot 28 times by four active Chicago police officers: John Wrigley, Eric White, Timothy Finley and Nicolas Olsen. Morgan was accused of aggravated battery, discharging a firearm, and attempted murder; no charges were filed against the police officers. Morgan was found not guilty of battery or discharging a firearm in his 2007 trial; no verdict was returned on attempted murder. Morgan was tried a second time for attempted murder and convicted in January 2012. In April 2012, he was sentenced to 40 years in prison. His case drew outrage from activists within Chicago and around the country. In January 2015, departing Illinois governor Pat Quinn granted him clemency. ==Background== In 2005, Morgan was 53 years old and lived in the North Lawndale neighborhood. He was a detective assigned to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad‚Äîa job he began in 1992. Morgan has children and grandchildren and has no criminal history. ==Incident== Morgan was driving home from his job as senior patrolman at the railroad. Around 12:45 AM on February 21, Chicago police officers John Wrigley and Timothy Finley pulled him over‚Äî for driving the wrong way on a one-way street and for having his lights off; they were joined by Officers Nicolas Olsen and Eric White. The events which followed are in dispute. Morgan says he was pulled from his vehicle by the four officers, who restrained him as he sought to produce police identification. He says one of the officers found his gun (a Glock 9mm), shouted \\"gun!,\\" and removed the gun from Morgan's waistband. Next came a wave of shooting. According to the officers, Finley saw Morgan pull out his gun. Finley yelled to the other three. Morgan fired seventeen gunshots, hitting Olsen's upper right arm, White's right calf, and Wrigley's left arm. Charice Rush, the only testifying third party witness at the scene, said she saw the officers 'snatch' Morgan from his van and force him onto one knee. She overheard an officer say \\"Oh shit, he has a gun.\\" Rush said she saw the four officers open fire on Morgan while he lay on the ground. Morgan was reported as having been shot 25 times. By the end of Morgan's 2007 trial, this number had been revised to 28. In addition to the 28 bullets that hit Morgan, many more were shot into the air, into Morgan's van, and into the walls and furniture of nearby houses. He was transported to Mt. Sinai hospital where his condition was reported as critical. According to Phillip Zaret, the trauma surgeon who treated on Morgan that night, Morgan had injuries to his neck, back, leg, liver, kidney, and colon. Dr. Zaret also treated Olsen for the wound to his arm. Morgan took 7 months to recover. ==Bail, imprisonment and release== On April 15, 2005, a bail hearing was held in a conference room of Oak Forest County Hospital, where Morgan was recovering. Judge Kathleen Mary Pantle set his bail at $2 million. Judge Clayton Crane later upheld the $2 million bail despite requests from Morgan's lawyer, Sam Adam Jr., that he be allowed lower bail to facilitate his recovery. Rosalind Morgan, Howard Morgan's wife, was able to raise $12,000 in donations for her husband's bail. The remaining necessary $188,000 was added all at once by a single anonymous donor. ==2007 trial== Morgan was prosecuted, by Assistant State Attorney Dan Groth, for four counts of attempted murder, four counts of aggravated battery of a police officer, and two counts of discharging a firearm. The trial was conducted at Cook County criminal court building, with Judge Crane presiding. The defense rested immediately after the prosecution's closing arguments, confident that their case had been made. Morgan was found not guilty of battery and discharging a firearm. The jury was hung on the charges of attempted murder, resulting in mistrial. According to defense attorneys, ten jurors considered Morgan not guilty, but two would not accede to this judgment. ==2012 trial== Morgan was found guilty of attempted murder in a re- trial taking place in January 2012. The trial was again presided over by Judge Crane and held at the Cook County Criminal Courts building in Chicago. The verdict was handed down on January 27; the jury took only 3 hours to decide. Morgan was incarcerated and his bail bond was revoked. He planned to appeal. ==The case== Testimony Wrigley, White, Finley, & Olsen Officer Finley testified that at 12:35 AM on February 21, he and Officer Wrigley heard a sound that they believed to be a gunshot. He said they saw a van going the wrong way down a one-way street with its lights off. The officers followed it through several stop signs, then pulled it over. Finley says that he drew his gun as Morgan got out of his own car. Finley and Wrigley were joined by Olsen and White. Finley testified that Morgan complied with an order to put his hands on the van, but then began to struggle while being patted down. Finley describes an extended gunfight, during which Morgan fired at the officers from the ground. He explains the bullets in Morgan's back by saying that the officers were spread out, and so when Morgan stood up, he had to turn all around to shoot at them. The other three officers gave similar testimony. Justin Dukes, a paramedic, testified that Morgan was combative and asked Dukes to \\"let him die.\\" Testimony from the four officers did not align on the question of whether Morgan was on his stomach or on his back, or on the question of when the officers stopped shooting. Howard Morgan Morgan testified that he did not fire at the officers, saying that they had pulled him from his car, guns already drawn, and pinned him to the ground. He said they found his gun while he was trying to produce his police identification. Morgan also said he was complying with traffic laws and that his headlights were on. Charice Rush Charice Rush was the only eyewitness to step forward. She said that she was locked out of her house and waiting to be let in, when two police cars pulled up behind a van stopped at a stop sign. She says she saw police \\"snatch\\" Morgan out of his car and eventually shoot him. Rush testified that Morgan's hands were still behind his back when they started shooting. Rush delivered a written statement to the police soon after the event. This statement contradicted some of her testimony; the defense argued that the written statement was heavily influenced by Catherine Nauher, the state attorney who solicited it. The prosecution called Rush's testimony into question by invoking her young age (18) and inaccuracies in her testimony (she said she saw a female officer in the back of the second car). Character witnesses A number of character witnesses, including police officers, fellow churchgoers, and longtime friends, testified consistently that Morgan \\"was an honorable man.\\" Evidence * Police photographs showing that the van's lights were actually on. * The police said they believed Morgan's gun had been fired; the defense argued that no attempt was made to check Morgan's hands or the gun itself. Arguments Defense attorneys called attention to their relative inexperience, citing 10 total years among them. Prosecutors argued that Morgan was actually afraid the officers would discover his expired firearm owners identification card. Assistant State Attorney Dan Groth, who co-prosecuted the case in both trials, argued that the officers held back, saying \\"Every bullet [Morgan] got, he earned.\\" ==Sentencing== On April 5, 2012, Judge Clayton J. Crane sentenced Morgan to 40 years in prison. Morgan had faced a possible sentence of 80 years; however, his attorney Herschella Conyers had also hoped that Crane would rule on the possibility of another trial. Supporters, including Occupy Chicago demonstrated inside the courtroom. They stood when Morgan entered and some remained standing throughout the hearing. Officer John Wrigley condemned Morgan at the hearing. Wrigley raised his voice to say, \\"You shot me, Morgan. You came very close to taking my life... you slandered our reputations as police officers. ... you are a fraud.\\" Judge Crane actually issued four sentences. One, 40 years, one, 35 years, and two for 25 years. These sentences were reported as 40 years because Morgan may serve them concurrently. ==Clemency== On his last day in office in January 2015, Illinois governor Pat Quinn commuted Morgan's sentence, which frees him from prison without pardoning him. He was released on January 14, 2015. ==Police reaction== The Chicago Police Department has been supportive of Wrigley, Finley, Olsen, and White, awarding them for valiant behavior in 2006. Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police celebrated the 2012 decision as \\"justice served.\\" The FOP also encouraged supporters of the four officers to appear at Morgan's April 5 sentencing, dismissing the importance of race and accusing Chicago Sun-Times reporter Mary Mitchell of bias and of publishing intentionally misleading information. Morgan's supporters have faulted the police department for crushing Morgan's car, which could have been used for evidence. Because Morgan was still in hospital and did not receive a claim letter sent to his house, his vehicle and the personal belongings it contained were destroyed without his consent. Police also did not produce 25 of the 28 bullets that pierced Morgan's body. ==Accusations of racism== Howard Morgan, his attorney Sam Adam Jr., and Charice Rush, the only witness to the event, are all black. The four other officers involved are all white. The twelve-person jury that found Morgan guilty had ten white members. Ted Pearson, Co-Chairperson of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, said \\"This case reeks of the kind of white supremacy that shocked the nation 80 years ago when nine Black teenagers were falsely accused and sentenced to death in Alabama for the rape of two white girls on the flimsiest of evidence.\\" Pearson believed that global outrage was necessary to free Morgan. Morgan's supporters, including his wife, Rosalind, also complained about unfairness in the judicial process, arguing that Morgan's 2012 trial constitutes double jeopardy. Some close to the case compared the unfairness in the situation to the case surrounding the shooting of Trayvon Martin. Efforts were mounted to raise national awareness of the case, particularly through social media, including a Change.org petition and the \\"Free Howard Morgan\\" website. Supporters planned to deliver petitions to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, as well as to Illinois and Cook County officials. ==References * Free Howard Morgan Campaign * Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression * Fraternal Order of Police: Chicago Lodge 7 Category:American shooting survivors Category:Crimes in Chicago Category:Gun politics in the United States Category:Law enforcement in Illinois Category:American people convicted of attempted murder Category:Chicago Police Department ","title":"Howard Morgan case"},{"id":"35333585","text":"Argyresthia columbia is a moth of the family Yponomeutidae.

The first two volumes were published in 2011 and the third in 2017. It is a follow-up to Parfit's 1984 book Reasons and Persons. It has an introduction by Samuel Scheffler. ==Summary== Parfit defends an objective ethical theory and suggests that we have reasons to act that cannot be accounted for by subjective ethical theories. Furthermore, it attempts to present a moral theory that combines three traditional approaches in moral and political philosophy: Kantian deontology, consequentialism, and contractarianism (of the sort advocated by T. M. Scanlon, and from the tradition of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Rawls). According to Parfit, these theories converge rather than disagree, \\"climbing the same mountain on different sides\\", in Parfit's metaphor. Parfit labels his synthesis of these three ethical theories the \\"Triple Theory\\": > An act is wrong if and only if, or just when, such acts are disallowed by > some principle that is #one of the principles whose being universal laws > would make things go best, #one of the only principles whose being universal > laws everyone could rationally will.... #a principle that no one could > reasonably reject. On Parfit's view, these three criteria (a) represent the best versions of consequentialism, Kantian ethics, and contractarianism respectively, and (b) should generally agree in their recommendations. Both claims have proven controversial. == Writing == The manuscript, originally titled Climbing the Mountain, circulated for many years prior to publication, and occasioned a great deal of excitement, including reading groups and a conference prior to publication. Some of On What Matters is derived from lectures given at the University of California, Berkeley as part of the Tanner Lectures on Human Values in 2002. As part of that series at Berkeley, Parfit's lectures were responded to by Allen W. Wood, T. M. Scanlon and Susan Wolf. ==Reception== The economist Tyler Cowen has expressed admiration for Parfit's style (\\"Reading him is an unforgettable and illuminating experience\\") in On What Matters, but argues: :I see the biggest and most central part of the book as a failure, possibly wrong but more worryingly \\"not even wrong\\" and simply missing the questions defined by where the frontier ‚Äì choice theory and not just philosophic ethics ‚Äì has been for some time. Peter Singer was far more positive, saying that Parfit's arguments \\"put those who reject objectivism in ethics on the defensive\\". Constantine Sandis raises an objection to Parfit's project: the various \\"theories may well converge on their recommendations, but to think that the actions that follow from them are all that matters is to already presuppose the truth of consequentialism\\". Sandis jokes that the significance of Parfit's work, despite his scant publication record, should cause us to question the \\"publish or perish\\" demands of the Research Excellence Framework, but \\"whether it will change the way we think about morality remains to be seen\\". The sheer length of time Parfit took to write the text, and the increasing incompatibility of such extended work with the demands of academic life was raised by Nigel Thrift, vice-chancellor of the University of Warwick, in a blog post on the Chronicle of Higher Education website: : Parfit's life has been able to be intellectually uncompromising because he found the infrastructure ‚Äì especially All Souls College in Oxford, which does no undergraduate teaching ‚Äì that allowed it to be. But I wonder how much longer that kind of infrastructure will be available in all but a few universities. The philosopher Roger Scruton questioned the appropriateness of the title of the book, writing in 2015 \\"Nothing that really matters to human beings ‚Äì their loves, responsibilities, attachments, their delights, aesthetic values, and spiritual needs ‚Äì occurs in Parfit‚Äôs interminable narrative. All is swept into a corner by the great broom of utilitarian reasoning, to be left there in a heap of dust\\". ==References== Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:Books by Derek Parfit Category:Ethics books Category:Contemporary philosophical literature Category:Oxford University Press books ","title":"On What Matters"},{"id":"35333800","text":"The Bacardi Building (Edificio Bacard√≠) is an Art Deco Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodr√≠guez-Castells and Rafael Fern√°ndez Ruenes and completed in 1930. It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320 sq meter lot in Las Murallas, Old Havana. ==History== The Bacardi Building was designed to be the headquarters for the Bacardi Rum Company; it was nationalized by the Castro government in the early 1960s. In 2001, the building was restored by an Italian construction firm. The interior retains the original decorations in marble and granite. It is regarded as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in Latin America. ==Architecture== Bacardi Building, Ground Floor Plan The building was the outcome of an architectural design competition. The owners of the Bacardi company invited a number of architects to present their design proposals for a new headquarters building offering 1,000 pesos to the winner. The competition was made up of a panel of judges that included Henri Schueg Chassin, president of Bacardi, and the architects Leonardo Morales y Pedroso, the architect for Colegio Belen, Enrique Gil, Emilio de Soto, and Pedro Mart√≠nez Incl√°n. The first prize was awarded to architects Esteban Rodr√≠guez-Castells and Rafael Fern√°ndez Ruenes. Jos√© Men√©ndez Men√©ndez was the architect-engineer in the project. Construction of the building started on January 6, 1930, and was completed by the 300-day deadline the company had set for December. Poor conditions of the land required that the foundation use piles of hardwood (jiqui and j√∫caro negro) and high strength concrete. At the peak of the building (47m) is a bronze sculpture of the company logo, a fruit bat. Its design gives the building a unique chromatic effect and a decorative element of Catalan modernism. At the brim of the building are inflected flat panel sculptures of sirens. Bacardi Building, first floor The first floor contained a bar with column archways where patrons of the restaurant in the mezzanine area could overlook the bar while they dined. It was open to the public and known to have many celebrities who frequented. Most of the marble and granite were imported from Europe: Germany, Sweden, Norway, Italy, France, Belgium and Hungary. With an area of 1,075 sq. meters and 7.25 meters of support, the first floor walls, floor, and ceiling are adorned in pink granite from Bavaria, and the two halls are of green marble from floor to ceiling. The construction work was carried out by the company Grasyma of Wansiedel, Bavaria of Germany, which took great care in the fine details of the work and the time-sensitivity of the project deadline. The property has a cistern with capacity for of water, which pumped into a tank inside the tower with capacity for . In addition, it has four elevators for different uses: two are used for passengers with a capacity of 10 people each and a speed of 350 feet per minute; another is a cargo elevator for the transportation of furniture, with a capacity of ; and the fourth one makes trips between the basement and the first floor to transport goods. Construction was completed in December 1930 and at the time it was the tallest building in Havana. ==ReferencesGallery== File:Cuba libre (6802001526).jpg File:Havana Art Deco (8954145059).jpg File:Barcardi Rum building detail, Havana, Cuba LCCN2010638790.tif File:Havana Art Deco (8954188031).jpg File:Bacardi building 4 (3209478372).jpg ==See also== *L√≥pez Serrano Building Category:Buildings and structures in Havana Category:Art Deco architecture Category:Bacardi Category:Office buildings completed in 1930 ","title":"Bacardi Building (Havana)"},{"id":"35333835","text":"Crosville Motor ServicesCompanies House extract company no 5706548 Crosville Motor Services Limited was a bus and coach operator based in Weston-super- Mare, North Somerset, England.

Where a person had been committed to gaol under a writ de contumace capiendo, that person was to be discharged.

This section was repealed by section 1 of, and Part II of the Schedule to, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969. ==Developments== In 1998, political campaigner Peter Tatchell was charged under Section 2 of the Act for \\"indecent behaviour in a church.\\" In 2002, the House of Lords' Select Committee on Religious Offences in England and Wales delivered their First Report. In Chapter 3 of this report, they examined the \\"Law as it stands,\\" including looking at \\"Old statutes.\\" This included the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860, where they revealed that \\"According to statistics made available by the Home Office, there were 60 prosecutions under this Act in the six years 1997-2002, with 21 convictions.\\" In his evidence to the Committee, David Calvert-Smith, the Director of Public Prosecutions said that: \\"We use it sufficiently often or have used it in the past for it obviously to be the right offence to use and a redrafted Section 2 would probably be a (albeit infrequently used) valuable offence.\\" In a landmark decision in 2017, a new law was enacted, nicknamed \\"Turing's Law,\\" which will allow posthumous pardons for anyone convicted under former law, including, but not exclusively the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860, the 1956 and 1967 Sexual Offences Acts, both of which yet remain to be overturned. Under the new law, descendants, relatives, and advocates can now apply to have the records of dead gay and bisexual men cleared in the law. Several restrictions, as yet, remain in place. The restrictions mean that pardons might not be granted in more complicated cases like that of Oscar Wilde, who was convicted of gross indecency with evidence that he frequented prostitutes. Justice minister Sam Gyimah, who advocated for the legislation, said, ‚ÄúThis is a truly momentous day. We can never undo the hurt caused, but we have apologised and taken action to right these wrongs. I am immensely proud that ‚ÄòTuring‚Äôs law‚Äô has become a reality under this government.‚Äù Human rights advocate Peter Tatchell estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 men who were convicted under various anti-gay laws in the UK may be eligible for pardons. Tatchell noted that some laws are not specifically mentioned as being up for pardon. ‚ÄúIt does not explicitly allow for the pardoning of men convicted of soliciting and procuring homosexual relations under the 1956 and 1967 Sexual Offences Acts. Nor does it pardon those people, including some lesbians, convicted for same-sex kissing and cuddling under laws such as the Public Order Act 1986, the common law offence of outraging public decency, the Town Police Clauses Act 1847, the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 and the army, navy and air force acts and other diverse statutes.‚Äù The law only applies to cases where the offenses would not be considered crimes today. The law was modeled on the Queen‚Äôs 2013 posthumous pardon of Alan Turing, who helped decode encrypted messages sent by Nazi Germany in World War II but was convicted of gross indecency after the war.https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2017/02/new-uk-law- allow-100000-sodomy-law-offenses-pardoned/ ==References== *Halsbury's Statutes, ==External links== *The Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860, as amended, from Legislation.gov.uk. *The Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860, as originally enacted, from Legislation.gov.uk.

It opens from 10 am to 10 pm and is home to Singapore‚Äôs first Olympic-size ice rink and the first IMAX theatre in the suburbs. It was built on the former site of the Jurong Entertainment Centre. The name, JCube was decided on after a naming competition held in 2010. J represents the mall‚Äôs location in Jurong. Cube represents what JCube was designed to look like - an ice cube. It was co- designed by RSP Architects and Benoy.http://capitamall.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20100521_123303_C38U_3D8A36343999FAD04825772A00070A70.1.pdf It is owned by CapitaMall Trust and managed by CapitaMalls Asia and thus is a participating mall in CapitaStars, the cardless rewards programme by CapitaMalls Asia. ==Jurong Entertainment Centre== Prior to its construction, a shopping centre Jurong Entertainment Centre was once located on its current site. It was closed for redevelopment in October 2008 and was expected to be completed by 2011. However, due to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 and high construction costs, the redevelopment programme was delayed. The building was completely demolished in February 2010. ==Reconstruction and opening== On 21 May 2010, CapitaMall Trust held a groundbreaking ceremony for its new mall on the site of the former Jurong Entertainment Centre.JCube ‚Äì A Brand New Retail Landmark in Singapore‚Äôs Jurong Lake District The new mall, named JCube, comprises five levels of retail, two basement levels of car park and a rooftop landscaped plaza. JCube opened and welcomed shoppers on 2 April 2012 and is managed by CapitaMalls Asia. ==Green initiatives== In 2011, JCube was awarded the Green Mark Platinum award by the Building and Construction Authority in Singapore. It is estimated that the mall will save 7,793,984 kWh/year in energy and 3,419m3/year in water. This can be done because the mall is fitted with various green features to help it reduce the consumption of utilities. Grey-water ice shavings from the ice rink are recycled; plants in the mall are watered using rainwater collected from a rainwater harvesting tank; waste heat generated from the cooling of the ice rink is also recycled to heat the rink‚Äôs zamboni and shower rooms, the use of solar panels to generate electricity and the use of green demolition for the former Jurong Entertainment Centre. ==Tenants== *Daiso *The Rink *Shaw Theatres *KFC *The Manhattan Fish Market * Don Don Donki * 7-Eleven * 9PM Kkochi * Devil Chicken ==J.Avenue== Due to the opening of Jem and Westgate and declining number of shoppers, J.Avenue, located on Level 2 of JCube, was launched on 6 September 2014. J.Avenue is mainly targeted at the young, and to keep them returning, retail concepts will be constantly updated throughout the year. There are trick art installations so that people can take selfies with interesting backgrounds. Since their target audience, the young, are more tech-savvy, J.Avenue also launched an online portal,http://www.javenue.sg featuring some merchandise available at the stores in J.Avenue. ==References * Category:2012 establishments in Singapore Category:CapitaLand Category:Shopping malls in Singapore Category:Jurong East ","title":"JCube"},{"id":"35333914","text":"Enzo Ide (born 22 June 1991 in Tielt) is a Belgian racecar driver, who competes in the FIA GT1 World Championship. ==Racing career== Ide began his racing career in Belcar, racing a Porsche 997 GT3 for Prospeed Competition, together with Ruben Maes.

The site, located at 2100 Biscayne Boulevard, consists of the Bacardi Imports Tower and the Bacardi Imports Administration Annex, also known as \\"The Jewel Box\\". The tower and the annex were constructed in 1963 and 1973, respectively, and in 2018 they were added to the National Register of Historic Places. == Bacardi complex == The two buildings are located in a plaza at 2100 Biscayne Boulevard. The plaza sits directly above an underground parking garage and features a large painted Bacardi logo, which is visible to planes arriving at and departing from Miami International Airport. Both buildings are accessible from the parking garage via elevators.  Bacardi Imports Tower  The Bacardi Imports Tower, built in 1963, was the first of the two buildings to be constructed. It was commissioned by former Bacardi president Jos√© ‚ÄúPepin‚Äù Bosch and designed by Cuban architect Enrique Gutierrez. Azulejo murals by Brazilian artist and ceramist Francisco Brennand cover two of the building's walls, giving it the nickname \\"the blue tile building\\".  Bacardi Imports Administration Annex  The administration annex was constructed ten years after the tower, in 1973, and was designed by Ignacio Carrera-Justiz of Coral Gables, Florida. It is referred to as \\"The Jewel Box\\" because of the colorful hammered-glass mosaic covering its four sides. The Mesoamerican- themed mosaic was designed by German artist Johannes M. Dietz. == Induction into National Register of Historic Places == Around 2009, Miami citizens began a campaign to label the buildings as \\"historic\\". University of Miami professor of architecture Allan Shulman said \\"Miami's brand is its identity as a tropical city. The Bacardi buildings are exactly the sort that resonate with our consciousness of what Miami is about\\". In 2007, Chad Oppenheim, the head of Oppenheim Architecture + Design, described the Bacardi buildings as \\"elegant, with a Modernist [look combined with] a local flavour.\\" On April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects' Florida chapter placed the buildings on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places as Bacardi USA.

Web. 11 July 2016 The layout of the mausoleum is modeled on the Qin capital Xianyang, divided into inner and outer cities. The circumference of the inner city is 2.5 km (1.55 miles) and the outer is 6.3 km (3.9 miles). The tomb is located in the southwest of the inner city and faces east. The main tomb chamber housing the coffin and burial artifacts is the core of the architectural complex of the mausoleum. The tomb itself has not yet been excavated. Archaeological explorations currently concentrate on various sites of the extensive necropolis surrounding the tomb, including the Terracotta Army to the east of the tomb mound. The Terracotta Army served as a garrison to the mausoleum and has yet to be completely excavated. ==History== Work on the mausoleum began soon after Emperor Qin ascended the throne in 246 BC when he was still aged 13, although its full-scale construction only started after he had conquered the six other major states and unified China in 221 BC. The source of the account of the construction of the mausoleum and its description came from Sima Qian in chapter six of his Records of the Grand Historian, which contains the biography of Qin Shi Huang: Some scholars believe that the claim of having \\"dug through three layers of groundwater\\" to be figurative. It is also uncertain what the \\"man-fish\\" in the text refers to originally (in modern Chinese it means \\"mermaid\\"), interpretation of the term varies from whale to walrus and other aquatic animals such as giant salamander. Before the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor was completed, a peasant rebellion broke out during the late Qin dynasty. Zhang Han redeployed all the 700,000 people building the mausoleum to suppress the rebellion, so the construction of the mausoleum ceased. After Xiang Yu entered Xianyang, he was said to have looted the tomb. Afterwards, it is said that a shepherd unintentionally burnt down the tomb. The story goes that he went into the dug pit of the mausoleum, dug by Xiang Yu, to look for his sheep with a torch in his hand, and a fire was started, burning away the tomb structures.Han Shu„ÄäÊ±â‰π¶¬∑Ê•öÂÖÉÁéã‰º†„ÄãÔºöOriginal text: \\"È°πÁ±çÁÑöÂÖ∂ÂÆ´ÂÆ§Ëê•ÂÆáÔºåÂæÄËÄÖÂí∏ËßÅÂèëÊéòÔºåÂÖ∂ÂêéÁâßÂÑø‰∫°ÁæäÔºåÁæäÂÖ•ÂÖ∂ÂáøÔºåÁâßËÄÖÊåÅÁÅ´ÁÖßÁêÉÁæäÔºåÂ§±ÁÅ´ÁÉßÂÖ∂ËóèÊ§Å„ÄÇ\\" Translation: Xiang burned the palaces and buildings. Later observers witnessed the excavated site. Afterward a shepherd lost his sheep which went into the dug tunnel; the shepherd held a torch to look for his sheep, and accidentally set fire to the place and burned the concealed coffin. No solid evidence of the destruction of the tomb has been found, although evidence of fire damage has been found in the pits housing the Terracotta Army. Some scholars think that the mausoleum did not suffer any large-scale destruction. In 1987, the mausoleum, including the Terracotta Warriors, was listed as World Heritage Sites. ==Discovery of the Terracotta Warriors== General view of the pit ‚Ññ 1 in the museum of Xi'an The first fragments of warriors and bronze arrowheads were discovered by Yang Zhifa, his five brothers, and Wang Puzhi who were digging a well in March 1974 in Xiyang, a village of the Lintong county. At a depth of around two meters, they found hardened dirt, then red earthenware, fragments of terracotta, bronze arrowheads and terracotta bricks.Zhang Zhongli (1997), p. 16. Yang Zhifa threw the fragments of terracotta in the corner of the field, and collected the arrowheads to sell them to a commercial agency. Other villagers took terracotta bricks to make pillows. A manager in charge of the hydraulic works, Fang Shumiao, saw the objects found and suggested to the villagers that they sell them to the cultural centre of the district. Yang Zhifa received, for two carts of fragments of what would turn out to be terracotta warriors, the amount of 10 yuan. Zhao Kangmin, responsible for the cultural centre, then came to the village and bought everything that the villagers uncovered, as well as re-purchasing the arrowheads sold to the commercial agency. In May 1974, a team of archaeologists from Shaanxi went to the site to undertake the first excavations of what would later be designated Pit 1. In May 1976, Pit 2 was discovered by drilling and in July the Pit 3.Zhang Zhongli (1997), p.19. The excavations over an area of square meters produced about statues of terracotta warriors and horses, and about a hundred wooden battle chariots and numerous weapons. Large structures have been erected to protect the pits; the first was finished in 1979. A larger necropolis of six hundred pits was uncovered by 2008.. Some pits were found a few kilometers away from the mound of the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. ==Archaeological studies== Chariot found outside of the tomb mound The necropolis complex of Qin Shi Huang is a microcosm of the Emperor's empire and palace, with the tomb mound at the center. There are two walls, the inner and outer walls, surrounding the tomb mound, and a number of pits containing figures and artifacts were found inside and outside the walls. To the west inside the inner wall were found bronze chariots and horses. Inside the inner wall were also found terracotta figures of courtiers and bureaucrats who served the Emperor. Outside of the inner wall but inside the outer wall, pits with terracotta figures of entertainers and strongmen, as well as a pit containing a stone suit of armour were found. To the north of the outer wall were found the imperial park with bronze cranes, swan and ducks with groups of musicians. Outside the outer walls were also found imperial stables where real horses were buried with terracotta figures of grooms kneeling beside them. To the west were found mass burial grounds for the labourers forced to build the complex. The Terracotta Army is about 1.5 km east of the tomb mound. The Terracotta Warriors The tomb mound itself at present remains largely unexcavated, but a number of techniques were used to explore the site. The underground palace has been located at the center of the mound. Archaeological survey and magnetic anomaly studies indicate a 4-meter high perimeter wall, measuring 460 meters north to south and 390 meters east to west, which is made of bricks and serves as the wall of the underground palace. On top is an enclosing wall made of rammed earth of 30‚Äì40 meters in height. There are sloping passageways leading to the four walls. The west tomb passage is linked to a pit where the bronze chariots and horses were found. The tomb chamber itself is 80 meters long east to west, 50 meters north to south, and is about 15 meters high. There are, however, disagreements among the academic community about the depth at which the palace lies, with estimates ranging from 20 meters to 50 meters. According to the scientific exploration and partial excavation, a significant amount of metal is present in the underground palace which has a very good drainage system. Sima Qian's text indicates that during its construction the tomb may have reached groundwater, and the water table is estimated to be at a depth of 30 meters. An underground dam and drainage system was discovered in 2000 and the tomb appeared not to have been flooded by the groundwater. Anomalously high levels of mercury in the area of the tomb mound have been detected, which gives credence to the Sima Qian's account that mercury was used to simulate waterways and the seas in the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. However, some scholars believe that if the underground palace is excavated, the mercury would quickly volatilize. \\"A Preliminary Study of Mercury Buried in the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor\\", an article published in Archaeology magazine, Volume 7, says that during the measuring of soil mercury content, one measured point reached 1440 parts per billion; the rest of 53 points reached an average content of around 205 ppb. There is also a claim that the mercury content is actually a result of local industrial pollution. It is reported in \\"Lintong County Annals\\" that from 1978 to 1980, according to general investigation on workers involved with benzene, mercury and lead, 1193 people from 21 factories were found poisoned.\\" In December 2012, it was announced that the remains of an \\"imperial palace\\" of great size had been found at the site. Based on its foundations, the courtyard-style palace was estimated to be 690 meters long and 250 meters wide, covering an area of 170,000 square meters, which is nearly a quarter of the size of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The palace included 18 courtyard houses and a main building that overlooked the houses. The archaeologists have been excavating the foundations since 2010 and have found walls, gates, stone roads, pottery shards and some brickwork. ==Opinions on possible excavation== Beginning in 1976, various scholars proposed to explore the underground palace, citing the following main reasons: * The Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor is in a seismic zone, so underground cultural relics need to be unearthed for protection; * to develop tourism; and * to prevent grave robbery. Bronze swan However, opponents of such excavations hold that China's current technology is not able to deal with the large scale of the underground palace yet. For example, in the case of the Terracotta Army, the archaeologists were initially unable to preserve the coat of paint on the surface of terracotta figures, which resulted in the rapid shedding of their painted decoration when exposed to air. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) indicated that research and evaluations should be conducted first so as to develop a protection plan for the underground palace, and rejected a proposal by archaeologists to excavate another tomb close by thought to belong to the Emperor's grandson over fears of possible damage to the main mausoleum itself. == References  * Disputes over Possible Excavation * Mausoleum of Emperor Qinshihuang (259‚Äì210 BC) * The Necropolis of the First Emperor of Qin Excerpt from lecture * Category:Qin dynasty Category:National archaeological parks of China Category:Mausoleums in China Category:Buildings and structures in Xi'an Category:Tourist attractions in Xi'an Category:World Heritage Sites in China Category:Pyramids in China Category:Qin Shi Huang Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Shaanxi Category:AAAAA-rated tourist attractions ","title":"Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor"},{"id":"35333964","text":"Thomas Milton (1743 ‚Äì 1827) was an English engraver. ==Biography== He was a son of John Milton (fl. 1770), the marine painter, and was descended from a brother of the poet John Milton.

The design drew inspiration from the warehouse/container style of existing buildings which surrounded the site. The Architects have combined this industrial theme with a reference to one of their previous sculptural and graphical artworks. Polygreen house is a low-maintenance architectural solution with much light and warmth, the house has four storeys including an office on the ground floor that is separated from the house by a garage and workshop. ==Location== The site on which Polygreen was built is down a narrow service lane filled with old industrial sheds. The construction of these types of buildings generally follow similar design parameters, as a result they share similar characteristics: most will be built with external walls placed as close to the block boundary as possible, and generally positioned right up against the street. This is done so as to achieve a maximum internal space with minimal external fuss. The list of building materials used in these types of buildings are also quite general, those that reflect the fast, cheap, and simple methods of construction; for example, construction using either a timber or steel frame, then covered with a lightweight cladding for internal and external surfaces. The structure of Polygreen house can be described as part warehouse and part shipping container. It followed many of the traditional methods of construction conducive to these types of buildings, however the architects have refashioned this building typology by using a delicate translucent skin as the external surface of the building. This skin envelopes the internal space, although some permeations have been positioned on each side to allow natural light into the space. Like those on neighboring blocks, Polygreen is built to the boundary as a means to maximise space on the small site (only 7 by 16 metres). The container building‚Äôs outer skin however is made of woven fibreglass. The fibreglass was then screen-printed in a pattern of varying shades of green. The fibreglass skin covers three of the elevations; it was deliberately peeled back from the northern side to be replaced with full-length double-awning glazing. This also made it possible for the making of an opening out onto an open-air deck. The deck is accessed over split levels, it is covered by an artificial turf and includes a slippery-slide for the architects‚Äô small children. ==Main features== The structure is in essence an elongated box, consisting of two identical storeys. The ground floor is occupied by the studio (giving onto the street), garage, and children‚Äôs room. The remaining internal space is divided into several living spaces over the different levels. While the designers found it important to maintain an ‚Äúopen-style plan‚Äù, they have also incorporated ‚Äúsoft walls‚Äù made of woven felt materials to inform circulation in a subtle way. There are clearly identifiable living, dining and children‚Äôs play areas. In general, the internal environment of Polygreen house seems to counteract the extreme simplicity of its exterior. Details seen in the casework, fittings and fixtures are all expressed with extreme sophistication. Wooden flooring floods each level and seamlessly transforms into broad steps where the levels interact. The house feels spacious despite its compactness. An open plan kitchen, dining and living area are on the upper level and this space is overlooked by a partially screened loft bedroom. To the north are views of a Victorian roof-scape and distant mountains.

It was built primarily on the own land of its owners, the Richardsons, and was intended to carry workers and freight from the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) GNR(I), in Newry to the family's flax mill in Bessbrook. In July 1884 Edward Hopkinson was contacted by the company, the Bessbrook Spinning Company to undertake the installation operation of electric traction for the line - the terms were that Hopkinson would provide locomotive power to operating ten trains each way every day, carrying 100 tons of freight a day, and with a capacity to haul 200 tons a day, with the locomotives able to pull 18 tons gross at 6 mph in addition to locomotive and passengers in the uphill direction (12 tons at 9 mph). Additionally Hopkinson was to run the line on a six-month trial, showing that the cost of operation was not more than that of steam traction. The work began in November 1884, with the line opening in October 1885; the terms of the trial were met in April 1886. The line started at the Edward Street terminus of the Newry branch of the GNR(I), it passed under the viaduct of the GNR(I) line (see Craigmore Viaduct.) before stations at Craigmore and Millvale, the line terminated at Beesbrook, after a length of . The line ascended steadily from Newry to Beesbook, with an average incline of 1 in 86, and a maximum of 1 in 50. Reversing loops were constructed at both terminii. The line's electricity generating station was at Millvale, using hydro- electric power from the Camlough river. The site had a water drop available, and a flow of at least per day. The water turbine was a double bucket inward- flow vortex wheel design (manufactured by MacAdam Brothers, Belfast.), specified to generate at 290 rpm with a flow of per minute, connected to the generator shed by a horizontal shaft. The electrical generators were two Edison-Hopkinson types supplied by Mather and Platt, each specified at 250 V, 72 A at 1000 rpm. Centre conductor cross sections left: transverse view, right: longitudinal view The line was electrified with a central rail sectional steel conductor; the sections were connected by copper strips, U-shaped to allow expansion of the joints. The rails were used as return conductors, also connected by copper strips at rail joints. The total resistance was approximately 0.25 ohms per mile. The centre track conductor was not laid at twelve level crossings; electrical connectivity was maintained by having a collector on the front and rear of the locomotive- carriages, the distance between which was greater than the insulated section. Another level crossing, made at a slew angle, long used an overhead copper wire, high, connecting to a cast iron collector on the roof of the locomotive. After a lightning strike resulted in several electrocutions, and caused blown fuses at the generator the rails were connected to earth at several points. Rolling stock thumb Tractive power was provided by two motor-carriages, manufactured by the Ashbury Carriage Company (Manchester), one and , with a motor and passenger compartments, the longer vehicle had first and second class seating, the shorter only second class. The longer locomotive-car had provision for 24 passengers in 2nd class and 10 in first class accommodation. A 33 ft bogie 5.5 ton passenger carriage was also acquired from the Starbuck Company (Birkenhead), with seating for 44. Each vehicle was a four axle two bogie design with the front bogie driven by a bogie mounted motor (UIC type: 2'B'), all four wheels were braked by a screw brake operated from the driving position, and the rear bogie wheels were also braked by a chain brake accessible to the conductor. There was a single open driving platform at one end of the vehicle. The total weight of the longer motor-carriage was . The motors were Edison-Hopkinson designs, connected by a chain drive mechanism to the wheels, with the bogie axles were coupled by connecting rods. The motor's rated power was , with this figure being exceeded in practice. Starting control was achieved using series resistances. Initially trains were composed of a locomotive-carriage with four wagons; the train could be increased to six wagons, or a second passenger carriage hauled - performance was with a load of on a 1 in 50 gradient. The tramway also introduced a system to allow road- worthy flangeless wheeled wagons on the line, first proposed by Alfred Holt, engineer, and brought into practice by Henry Barcroft of the Bessbrook spinning Co.; the system used a section set of rails, outside the main and slightly lower (7/8 inch), on which the flangeless wheels ran, using the inner main rails as guides. Operations Train of goods wagons The line was operated with two locomotive-carriages, a trailer carriage, and over 20 road- rail wagons. One of the carriage vehicles was replaced in 1921, and further trailer acquired from the Dublin and Lucan tramway in 1928. At its peak it carriage 100000 passengers, and ran 21,000 miles in a year. The line closed in 1948. ==Legacy== Preserved tram at the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum On the closure of the tramway, tram engine No 2 went back to Mather and Platt in Manchester, who refurbished it as a cricket hut at Park Works. In 1955 they presented it to Belfast Corporation for inclusion in the Transport Museum. It is now on view at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra. Another carriage, which has lain derelict in a field since the line closed, was rescued in December 2014 and is under restoration by the Southern Regional College. When completed, it will go on display near Newry railway station. The water turbine building has been demolished, the Bessbrook terminal building is still extant. Hopkinson's success led to him later being employed by the City and South London Railway, which used Edison-Hopkinson dynamos, and Hopkinson designed electric locomotives. ==NotesReferences== Literature * * * ==External links== Category:Tram transport in Northern Ireland Category:3 ft gauge railways in Northern Ireland ","title":"Bessbrook and Newry Tramway"},{"id":"35334014","text":"St Wilfrid and St Ann's Church is in Oldham Road, Newton Heath, Greater Manchester, England. It is a redundant Anglican parish church, which is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== The church was built in 1909‚Äì10, and designed by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley, providing seating for 504 people. It was closed for worship in 1997 and declared redundant on 1 December. ==Architecture== Constructed in glazed red brick, the church has sandstone dressings and slate roofs. Its architectural style is Perpendicular with Arts and Crafts features. The authors of the Buildings of England series state that it is \\"typical of the later work of the [Austin and Paley] practice\\". The church is orientated north-south, its plan consisting of a four-bay nave with clerestory, aisles that incorporate porches in their south ends, and a two-bay chancel. At the northeast corner of the nave is a bell tower, with its narrow side on the south. The lower part of the tower is in brick, and the top stage is stone, with blind tracery on the front and bell openings on the sides. At the centre of the south end of the nave is a tall canted bay containing transomed traceried windows. Above the bay is a chequered stone parapet. Below the windows is a sill carved with a text. The south end of the each aisle contains a doorway. Above the left doorway is a niche containing a statue, and over the right doorway is an oculus. Along the sides of the aisles are square- headed two-light windows, and in the clerestory are windows with pointed heads containing Perpendicular tracery. The north window has five lights. Inside the church are arcades carried on octagonal piers, a wooden reredos, a low stone wall between the nave and the chancel incorporating a wooden pulpit, and a stone font.

The Province of Ontario has created Acts to insure the protection archaeological and cultural resources. Acts such as the Ontario Heritage Act and Environmental Assessment Act provide the major legal documents that protect heritage and cultural resources. Additionally, Acts such as the Planning Act, the Aggregate Resource Act and the Ontario Cemeteries Act are also implemented when specific triggers occur during archaeological assessments. ==The Provincial Criteria for Determining Areas of Archaeological Potential== Areas of property that are considered archaeological potential are those that could contain archaeological resources. The ministry's criteria for determining areas of archaeological potential are: * The presence of known archaeological sites within 300 metres of the property; * The presence of a water source (primary, secondary, ancient) within 300 metres of the property; * Elevated topography (e.g., knolls, drumlins, eskers, plateaux); * Pockets of sandy soil in a clay or rocky area; * Unusual land formations (e.g., mounds, caverns, waterfalls); * Proximity to a resource-rich area (concentrations of animal, vegetable or mineral resources); * Evidence of early Euro-Canadian (non-Aboriginal) settlement (e.g., monuments, cemeteries) on the property; * Proximity to historic transportation routes (e.g., road, rail, portage); * The property is protected under the Ontario Heritage Act; * Local knowledge of archaeological sites on the property or of the property's heritage value. ==The process of Archaeological Assessment== There are six stages of an archaeological assessment in Ontario. {  - ! Stage !! Description -  Stage 1: Background study and Property Inspection  To determine if there is a potential archaeological site. Which the consulting archaeologists with look at geography, land use, historical information, as well as consult with community about possible heritage sites. -  Stage 2: Property Assessment  Look for any archaeological resources are present and if there are any that are culturally valuable. -  Stage 3: Site-Specific Assessment  More detail assessment is conducted to determine size of the site and evaluate cultural heritage significance and value. More research on the land and site is conducted. 1m x1m test units are conducted to see value (if environment allows- different methods maybe used with pavement or other barriers). -  Stage 4: Mitigation of Development Impacts  The proposals of implementing conservation strategies for archaeological sites and culturally valuable finds. This can lead to \\"in situ\\" (leave the site) or excavation straggles depending on the development project going on. -  Stage 5a: Long-Term Avoidance and Protection  When site is kept in place implementation of a long term plan to protect the archaeological site is created by the archaeologist. -  Stage 5b: Excavation  If site is unable to stay in place than the process of excavation is conducted and detailed documents are provided on the site (measurements, maps, drawings, photographs, and context with removed artifacts). -  Stage 6: Report to the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport This stage occurs at the end of any assessment whether it stops at Stage 1 or Stage 5. The archaeological assessment report is submitted to the Ministry for review which looks at: The licensed archaeologist met the terms and conditions of his or her license, including the ministry's requirements for fieldwork and reporting. Any archaeological sites found were properly conserved. } ==Ontario Heritage Act== The Ontario Heritage Act was created in 1975, was further amended in 1990, 2002, 2005 and as of 2009 as undergone further amendments. Under the Ontario Heritage Act, the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport contains the \\"responsibility to determine policies, priorities and programs for the conservation, protection and preservation of the heritage of Ontario and so fills the lead provincial government role in terms of direct conservation and protection of cultural resources.\\" The Ontario Heritage Act governs the general practice of archaeology in the province. It provides the legal framework to provide licenses to archaeologists who are qualified and it is $1,000,000 fine to alter any heritage site without a permit or license. The Act also provides protocols for assessments of archaeological sites, and \\"municipalities and the provincial government powers to preserve the heritage of Ontario\\" and focuses on protecting heritage properties and archaeological sites. In 2005 an amendment of the Ontario Heritage Act provided further implementations which: Give the province and municipalities new powers to delay and also to stop demolition of heritage sites. They balance enhanced demolition controls with an appeals process that respects the rights of property owners. Further expand the province's ability to identify and designate sites of provincial heritage significance. * Provide clear standards and guidelines for the preservation of provincial heritage properties. Enhance protection of heritage conservation districts, marine heritage sites and archaeological resources. * The Act provides a clear out line of what is required of the Municipalities and the Province when it comes to cultural resources. ==Suspicion of illegal actions== The Ontario Heritage Act describes the roles of inspectors, who are province appointed individuals who can be qualified in archaeology or accompanied by experts, who are implemented when suspicion arises during an excavation that is related harming or threatening the publics interests. Suspicion can be related to anything from falsification of data, to falsification of what is occurring on site (either through archaeologists or developers). An inspector is able to enter any of the following. ==The Environmental Assessment Act== The Environmental Assessment Act was created in 1976, to help to \\"provide for the protection, conservation, and wise management of Ontario's environment\\" which relates to all aspects of determining the ecological, cultural, economic and social impact of a project. This act is related and allows for all public sector and private infrastructure projects which contain projects, like roads hydro generation, sewage, water, landfills etc. to conduct an environmental assessment. The environmental assessments are conducted so to help with planning process and provide better knowledge about the site before development and decisions on projects are created. In many instances an environmental assessment determines the need for an archaeological assessment, and it is completed as part of the overall environmental assessment process, this is a result of any public development project, land changing activities, and all land own by the Province of Ontario. An environment assessment is conducted after the terms of reference is approved which relates to a general proposal of a project and preliminary involvement and cooperation with organizations and communities that will be affected by the development. The environmental assessment is the proposal after the terms of reference which provides the results of the organizers planning and decision-making process. Which provides identification and evaluation of alternative solutions to their location if problems arise, their environmental effects on the land and community, the impact mitigation and management measures on the environment, and \\"record of consultation with the public, Aboriginal communities and government agencies [which] is mandatory.\\" ==The Planning Act== Link to Citizens Guide to Planning Act of Ontario The Planning Act is an act of legislation that provides \\"the ground rules for land use planning in Ontario and describes how land uses may be controlled, and who may control them (planning act).\\" This act is provided to give Province authority to help govern and mediate between municipal and private corporations. Municipal (including planning boards) have more authority over the decisions about development of any infrastructure within their area, provide official plans they have for public development as well as any goals that are related to private enterprises.http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/Page1760.aspx Municipalities are in charge of setting out the rules and regulation to control zoning by-laws as well as must accord with all Provincial interests and plans about development. Furthermore, municipalities must reach their decisions with following other acts and regulations that may impact any development (i.e. the Environmental Assessment Act and the Ontario Heritage Act). \\" Thus all decisions made during the development process, regardless of the identity of the development proponent or the relevant approval agency, must address potential heritage resource impacts.\\" Under the Planning Act, the significance for \\"archaeological resources are defined as those 'that are valued for the important contribution they make to our understanding of the history of a place, an event, or a people.' The identification and evaluation of such resources are based upon archaeological fieldwork undertaken in accordance with the Ontario Heritage Act.\\" In summary, a municipality is obligated, within the existing legislative framework, to require archaeological concerns be addressed in connection with any planning application and is able to pass zoning by-law(s) regulating the use of land that is the site of a significant archaeological resource. Moreover, a municipality is prevented from undertaking any public work that does not comply with its Official Plan. Heritage protection policies are related to Official Plans (which are plans produced by the Ontario Government related to development and land allocation), if developed and incorporated properly. If a municipality has a sound basis in its policies (Official Plan), it is possible to refuse applications that do not conform to heritage requirements. Many triggers for archaeological assessment occur in the Planning Act and are predominantly enacted by new housing developments or other residential land developments which also must comply with the Ontario Heritage Act. ==Other Provincial legislation== There is other Provincial legislation that can affect cultural resource management and archaeological assessments in Ontario. The Aggregate Resources Act: which provides approval of pits and quarries and administered by the Ministry of Natural Resources, recognizes the potential impact of quarrying activities that may have an effect on cultural features such as archaeological resources. The process for addressing archaeological concerns within the Aggregate Resources Act is similar to that for Planning Act- related projects. The Cemeteries Act: This act shows the need to protect human burials, both marked and unmarked graves, which can provide another link to the past. Marked burials are provided protection as a heritage resource. \\"Burial locations uncovered on archaeological sites constitute 'unregistered cemeteries' that are, in essence, in violation of the Cemeteries Act. The discovery of such burials will require further investigation in order to define the extent and number of interments, and either the registration of the burial location as a cemetery, or the removal of the remains for re-interment in an established cemetery.\\" These archaeological burials can result in more complex legal issues. ==References== Category:Archaeology of Canada Category:Natural history of Ontario ","title":"Archaeology in Ontario"},{"id":"35334026","text":"Kaygusuz Abdal (1341‚Äì1444) was a Turkish folk poet of the 14th century. == Background == Kaygusuz Abdal In the 14th century Alaiye was the capital of the small Alaiye beylik (principality).

He at first played fiddle, but later also took up the Northumbrian smallpipes. He was a major figure in the folk music revival during the 1950s and 1960s, and an active member of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society. He was a founder member of the High Level Ranters, playing fiddle and smallpipes on their first record, Northumberland for Ever, but he subsequently left the group. Later he played in a country dance band, The Borderers. He was very active in recording traditional musicians in the area, notably Billy Pigg, and he would take a portable tape recorder to sessions and festivals. Several of these recordings were used to compile the record Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel,Billy Pigg, the Border Minstrel. Leader Sound, 1971: LEA 4006 while many more may be heard on the FARNE archive. Besides Billy Pigg, musicians he recorded include Joe Hutton, Diana Blackett-Ord, Richard Flemming and George Atkinson, as well as some duet recordings of himself with Colin Caisley. He also made, but did not retain, a recording of Tom Clough, late in the latter's life. He was also a pipemaker, and is believed to have made the first concert-pitch Northumbrian smallpipe chanter, for Billy Pigg. Billy Pigg on pipes, John Doonan on piccolo and Forster Charlton on fiddle, liked to play as a trio, but smallpipes were traditionally pitched rather lower than modern concert pitch, and correcting for this, by using a very sharp reed in the smallpipes and pulling out the tuning slide of the piccolo, caused intonation problems. However it is not known whether Billy Pigg ever used this chanter regularly.Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Part 1, ed. Colin Ross and Julia Say, 2nd edition, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2010.

He is known for his theory that the mythical city of Atlantis was located in Tunisia. Borchardt argued that the Shott el Jerid swamp, generally thought to mark the site of Lake Tritonis, was in fact the original Atlantic Sea referred to by Plato. Borchardt also identified Mount Atlas as being a peak in the Ahaggar Mountains, rather than in the Atlas range. He related the names of Berber tribes to the names of Poseidon's sons in Greek mythology, and suggested links between the city of Atlantis, the palace of Alkino√∂s referenced in The Odyssey and the City of Brass in the tales of The Arabian Nights. He believed he had discovered Atlantean ruins at Qabes, but these ruins were later found to be of Roman origin. During World War II, Borchardt was incarcerated at Dachau, due to his Jewish ancestry. He escaped to Britain in 1939, and thence to the United States. He was arrested and put on trial for spying in 1941, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. His early release was secured in 1952 due to petitioning from the German government, but he died less than a year afterwards. ==References== Category:German archaeologists Category:1886 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United States Category:20th-century archaeologists ","title":"Paul Borchardt"},{"id":"35334236","text":"Verallia North America formerly the North American division of Verallia, is a glass packaging brand of the multinational company Ardagh Group. It produces more than nine billion glass bottles and jars per year, from thirteen plants located throughout the United States and is headquartered in Muncie, Indiana. ==History== Verallia North America can trace its roots in the United States back to 1842 when Joseph Foster started a glass factory in Stoddard, New Hampshire. This factory later grew into the Foster-Forbes Glass Company. In 1886 the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company became the Ball Corporation. In 1995, the two U.S. glass companies merged to become Ball- Foster Glass Container Company and formed a joint venture with Saint-Gobain. Within one year, Saint-Gobain had acquired the remaining interest in the joint venture. Ball-Foster Glass Container Company was renamed Saint-Gobain Containers in 2000. In 2010, Saint-Gobain Packaging launched the Verallia brand name worldwide. In April 2014, Ardagh Group purchased Verallia North America from Saint-Gobain. ==Production== All divisions of Verallia combine to produce 25 billion glass bottles and jars annually, from 58 industrial sites in 14 different counties.

Cullet usually makes up 25% to 60% of the batch. Verallia North America has set a goal to make cullet account for 50% of all batches used in their production by 2013. Verallia North America has started the Captain Cullet and little Gob O'Glass campaign to spread awareness of glass recycling to children.

Some participating nations demanded that all sportswomen competing in the athletics, beach volleyball and swimming events wear body-covering sporting outfits instead of the usual, functional and official sports bikinis regulated by international rules. In some countries of the Muslim world, sporting suits for women called burqini, which cover the whole body except the face, the hands and the feet, are in use in accordance with Islamic culture. Furthermore, some countries asked the organizers to run the male and female events on separate days. Both regulations were applied in the first edition of the Games held in Saudi Arabia in 2005. The organizing committee refused to fully comply with the demands stating that only the countries ruled by Islamic governments among the 44 participants with Muslim population opposed the two-piece sporting outfits standardized in international sports dress code. The organizers ruled that the use of sports bikinis is set optional so that sportswomen may wear religious-based outfits. ==References * Official website Category:Islamic Solidarity Games Islamic Solidarity Games Category:2013 in Indonesian sport Solidarity Games Category:Multi-sport events in Indonesia Category:International sports competitions hosted by Indonesia ","title":"2013 Islamic Solidarity Games"},{"id":"35334303","text":"Dr. Sirajul Islam Medical College (SIMC) () is a private medical school in Bangladesh, established in 2011.

In his later years, he wrote articles on the dry plate process and other techniques for various photography journals. ==Life== Bell was born in Liverpool, England, in 1830, but immigrated to the United States with his parents as a young child.

In 1872, Bell joined George Wheeler's survey expedition, which was tasked with surveying American lands west of the 100th meridian, as a replacement for photographer Timothy H. O'Sullivan. As part of the expedition, he captured numerous large format and stereographic landscapes of relatively unexplored areas of the Colorado River basin in Utah and Arizona. While on the expedition, he experimented with the dry plate process, for which he would eventually become an expert. After the expedition, Bell returned to his studio in Philadelphia, and exhibited his work at the city's 1876 Centennial Exposition. Following the exposition, he sold his Chestnut Street studio to his son-in-law, William H. Rau. In 1882, Bell was hired by the U.S. Navy as a photographer for its Transit of Venus expedition. En route to Patagonia, where the Transit was observed, Bell captured a series of photographs of the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden in Brazil. Bell spent most of his later years doing studio work and writing technical articles for journals such as Photographic Mosaics and the Philadelphia Photographer, though he traveled to Europe in 1892 to photograph paintings for the Columbia World's Fair. He died at his home on Boston Avenue in Philadelphia on January 28, 1910, after a long illness. Along with his son-in-law, William Rau, Bell's son, Sargent, and daughter, Louisa, were avid photographers. His son, Henry, was an engraver. ==Works== Perched Rock, Rocker Creek, Arizona. 1872 photo by Bell, published by the Wheeler Survey. His career spanning six decades, Bell worked in nearly every major early photographic process, including daguerreotype, collodion processes, albumen prints, stereo cards, and early film. He was considered a pioneer of the dry plate and lantern slide processes, and experimented with night photography, using magnesium wire for lighting. He wrote technical articles on topics such as gelatine emulsions,\\"The Photographic Society of Philadelphia,\\" American Journal of Photography, Vol. 12 (1891), p. 233. the use of pyrogallic acid to recover gold from waste solutions,William Bell, \\"Use of Pyrogallic Acid in Recovering Waste Gold Solutions,\\" The Photographer's Friend, Vol. 1, No. 1 (January 1871), p. 17. and the development of isochromatic plates.William Bell, \\"Improved Developer and Isochromatic Plates,\\" Photographic Mosaics (1896), p. 125. For his Wheeler Survey photographs, Bell used two cameras ‚Äì an √ó for large prints, and an √ó for stereo cards. He used both wet and dry collodion processes on this expedition, and his photographs are characterized by dark foregrounds with elements becoming increasingly lighter in tone as distance increases.

A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for sexual intercourse and continue during it. Male arousal will lead to an erection, and in female arousal the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as nipples, vulva, clitoris, vaginal walls, and vaginal lubrication. Mental stimuli and physical stimuli such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of hormones, can influence sexual arousal. Sexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient sexual stimulation, sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an orgasm. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm. ==Terminology== There are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including horny, turned on, randy, steamy, and lustful. Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called erotic stimuli and colloquially known as turn-ons. ==Erotic stimuli== Depending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an erogenous zone or acts of foreplay can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a romantic setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal. Stimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: somatosensory (touch), visual, and olfactory (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three. Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including kissing, cuddling, and petting of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the breasts, nipples, buttocks and/or genitals, and further sexual activity. Erotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find nudity, erotica or pornography sexually arousing.DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \\"Lust For The Long Haul\\". Psychology Today. 2008-12-26 This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as sexual fetishism, or in some instances a paraphilia. There is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from McGill University Health Centre in Montreal (in Canada) used the method of thermal imaging to record baseline temperature change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal ‚Äî around 10 minutes. The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances. Unlike many other animals, humans do not have a mating season, and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year. ==Disorders== Sexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are sexually inhibited. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person. However, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a sexual arousal disorder or hypoactive sexual desire disorder. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, drug use, or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation. On the other hand, a person may be hypersexual, which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a persistent genital arousal disorder, which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal. == Physiological and psychological response patterns ==  Physiological responses  Sexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the sex organs (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the swelling and erection of the penis when blood fills the corpus cavernosum. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the clitoris and vulva, as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as lubrication. { class= - !style=\\"width:50%\\" In males: !In females: - thumb Male sexual arousal.

In the left image female genitalia are in regular state.

Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to vasodilation and the increased blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run along the length of the penis (the two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the scrotum is pulled tighter, and the testes are pulled up against the body. However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one. After their mid-forties, some men report that they do not always have an erection when they are sexually aroused. Equally, a male erection can occur during sleep (nocturnal penile tumescence) without conscious sexual arousal or due to mechanical stimulation (e.g. rubbing against the bed sheet) alone. A young man ‚Äî or one with a strong libido ‚Äî may experience enough sexual arousal for an erection to result from a passing thought, or just the sight of a passerby. Once erect, his penis may gain enough stimulation from contact with the inside of his clothing to maintain and encourage it for some time. As sexual arousal and stimulation continues, it is likely that the glans or head of the erect penis will swell wider and, as the genitals become further engorged with blood, their color deepens and the testicles can grow up to 50% larger. As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the perineum. With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and breathing becomes quicker. The increase in blood flow in the genital and other regions may lead to a sex flush sometimes, in some men. As sexual stimulation continues, orgasm begins, when the muscles of the pelvic floor, the vas deferens (between the testicles and the prostate), the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland itself may begin to contract in a way that forces sperm and semen into the urethra inside the penis. Once this has started, it is likely that the man will continue to ejaculate and orgasm fully, with or without further stimulation. Equally, if sexual stimulation stops before orgasm, the physical effects of the stimulation, including the vasocongestion, will subside in a short time. Repeated or prolonged stimulation without orgasm and ejaculation can lead to discomfort in the testes (corresponding to the slang term \\"blue balls\\"Weinzimer, S.A. & Thorton, P.S., \\"Blue balls\\", \\" Pediatrics 108(5), 1233-1234\\", 2001). After orgasm and ejaculation, men usually experience a refractory period characterised by loss of erection, a subsidence in any sex flush, less interest in sex, and a feeling of relaxation that can be attributed to the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin. The intensity and duration of the refractory period can be very short in a highly aroused young man in what he sees as a highly arousing situation, perhaps without even a noticeable loss of erection. It can be as long as a few hours or days in mid- life and older men. Female  The beginnings of sexual arousal in a woman's body is usually marked by vaginal lubrication (wetness; though this can occur without arousal due to infection or cervical mucus production around ovulation), swelling and engorgement of the external genitals, and internal lengthening and enlargement of the vagina. There have been studies to find the degree of correlation between these physiological responses and the woman's subjective sensation of being sexually aroused: the findings usually are that in some cases there is a high correlation, while in others, it is surprisingly low. Further stimulation can lead to further vaginal wetness and further engorgement and swelling of the clitoris and the labia, along with increased redness or darkening of the skin in these areas as blood flow increases. Further changes to the internal organs also occur including to the internal shape of the vagina and to the position of the uterus within the pelvis. Other changes include an increase in heart rate as well as in blood pressure, feeling hot and flushed and perhaps experiencing tremors. A sex flush may extend over the chest and upper body. If sexual stimulation continues, then sexual arousal may peak into orgasm. After orgasm, some women do not want any further stimulation and the sexual arousal quickly dissipates. Suggestions have been published for continuing the sexual excitement and moving from one orgasm into further stimulation and maintaining or regaining a state of sexual arousal that can lead to second and subsequent orgasms. Some women have experienced such multiple orgasms quite spontaneously. While young women may become sexually aroused quite easily, and reach orgasm relatively quickly with the right stimulation in the right circumstances, there are physical and psychological changes to women's sexual arousal and responses as they age. Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and fantasies, sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after menopause. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status. It is therefore seen as important always to understand the \\"context of women's lives\\" when studying their sexuality. Reduced estrogen levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness and less clitoral erection when aroused, but are not directly related to other aspects of sexual interest or arousal. In older women, decreased pelvic muscle tone may mean that it takes longer for arousal to lead to orgasm, may diminish the intensity of orgasms, and then cause more rapid resolution. The uterus typically contracts during orgasm and, with advancing age, those contractions may actually become painful.  Psychological response  Psychological sexual arousal involves appraisal and evaluation of a stimulus, categorization of a stimulus as sexual, and an affective response. The combination of cognitive and physiological states elicits psychological sexual arousal.Chivers, M. L. \\"Leading comment: A brief review and discussion of sex differences in the specificity of sexual arousal\\", Sexual and Relationship Therapy, 20(4), 377-390, 2005 Some suggest that psychological sexual arousal results from an interaction of cognitive and experiential factors, such as affective state, previous experience, and current social context.  Male  The relationship between sexual desire and arousal in men is complex, with a wide range of factors increasing or decreasing sexual arousal. Physiological responses, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and erection, are often discordant with self-reported subjective perceptions of arousal.Chivers, M.L., Reiger, G., Latty, E., & Bailey, J.M., \\"A sex difference in the specificity of sexual arousal\\", Psychological Science 15(11), 736-744, 2004 This inconsistency suggests that psychological or cognitive aspects also have a strong effect on sexual arousal. The cognitive aspects of sexual arousal in men are not completely known, but the state does involve the appraisal and evaluation of the stimulus, categorization of the stimulus as sexual, and an affective response. Research suggests that cognitive factors, such as sexual motivation, perceived gender role expectations, and sexual attitudes, contribute to sex differences observed in subjective sexual arousal. Specifically, while watching heterosexual erotic videos, men are more influenced by the sex of the actors portrayed in the stimulus, and men may be more likely than women to objectify the actors. There are reported differences in brain activation to sexual stimuli, with men showing higher levels of amygdala and hypothalamic responses than women. This suggests the amygdala plays a critical role in the processing of sexually arousing visual stimuli in men.  Female  Research suggests that cognitive factors like sexual motivation, perceived gender role expectations, and sexual attitudes play important roles in women's self-reported levels of sexual arousal. In her alternative model of sexual response, Basson suggests that women's need for intimacy prompts them to engage with sexual stimuli, which leads to an experience of sexual desire and psychological sexual arousal. Psychological sexual arousal also has an effect on physiological mechanisms; Goldey and van AndersGoldey, K. L., & van Anders, S. M. \\"Sexy thoughts: Effects of sexual cognitions on testosterone, cortisol, and arousal in women\\", Hormones and Behavior, 59, 754-764, 2011 showed that sexual cognitions impact hormone levels in women, such that sexual thoughts result in a rapid increase in testosterone in women who were not using hormonal contraception. In terms of brain activation, researchers have suggested that amygdala responses are not solely determined by level of self-reported sexual arousal; Hamann and colleagues found that women self-reported higher sexual arousal than men, but experienced lower levels of amygdala responses. ==Models of human sexual response== Human sexual response cycle During the late 1950s and early 1960s, William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson conducted many important studies into human sexuality. In 1966, they published Human Sexual Response, detailing four stages of physiological changes in humans during sexual stimulation: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. Singer's model of sexual arousal Barry Singer presented a model of the process of sexual arousal in 1984, in which he conceptualized human sexual response to be composed of three independent but generally sequential components. The first stage, aesthetic response, is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, approach response, progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final genital response stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is the most reliable and convenient to measure in males. Basson's sexual response cycle In 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is specific to women‚Äôs sexual response. She argues that gender differences in sex drive, sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for intimacy, which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to sexual desire. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of female sexual dysfunction; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity. Toates's incentive-motivation model Frederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of incentive-motivation theory and hierarchical control of behavior. The basic incentive-motivation model of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized hierarchically; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering cognitive representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation. Bancroft and Janssen's dual control model This model created by John Bancroft and Erick Janssen, previously at the Kinsey Institute, explores the individual variability of sexual response. They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book Come as You Are, the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster. The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels. A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors. These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). The SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates. Female focus groups found that the context of the emotional relationship between sexual partners was not fully represented in the original SIS/SES questionnaire. A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI). This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender. One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal. Regardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition. In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women. On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition. As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. The source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively. Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals. Age of first masturbation has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003). Masturbation as a marker of sexual development. In J. Bancroft (Ed.), Sexual development in childhood (pp. 156‚Äì185). Bloomington: Indiana University Press. Researchers have not determined whether this gender difference is biological in nature or influenced by sociocultural values. One twin-study has found evidence for the heritability of both factors of SIS, but research suggests that SES variability is down to environmental factors. The majority of studies investigating sexual functioning use heterosexual participants exclusively, unfortunately limiting the generalizability of the dual control model. To date, one study comparing heterosexual and homosexual males found that homosexual men had similar scores for SIS2, but scored significantly higher for SIS1 and SES. Straight, lesbian, and bisexual women's scores on the SESII-W found that bisexual women scored higher on SES than the other groups and straight women scored higher on the sexual inhibition factor than both the lesbian and bisexual women.Sanders, S. A., Graham, C. A., & Milhausen, R. R. (2008c). [Sexual orientation and SESII‚ÄìW]. Unpublished raw data. More studies need to be done using the dual control model to gain a more broad view of sexual orientation and sexual arousability. ==Assessment of genital arousal== One way to study sexual arousal in women and men is to conduct sexual psychophysiological research in a laboratory setting. This field of research looks at physical sexual responses in addition to mental and emotional experiences of sexual arousal.Rosen, R.C., & Beck, J. G. Patterns of sexual arousal: Psychophysiological processes and clinical application, New York: Guilford Press Experimental studies Various hypotheses and theories have been propounded in order to establish the biological bases for sexual arousal in humans. Ivan Tarkhanov showed, in experiments on cutting and artificial emptying of the seminal vesicles, that the latter played the crucial role in the generation of sexual excitement in frogs. Proceeding from these experimental results, Tarkhanov put forward a hypothesis that filling and evacuation of the seminal vesicles were the main biological cause which led to sexual arousal and its disappearance in mammals and humans.–¢–∞—Ä—Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ò. –†. –ö —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∞–ø–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ —É –ª—è–≥—É—à–∫–∏ (On Physiology of the Reproductive system in frogs). ‚Äî ¬´–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω–∞ (Russian medicine)¬ª, 1885, ‚Ññ30‚Äì32, —Å. 1‚Äì26. See also in German: Tarchanoff, J. R., Arch. f. d. g. Physiol. des Mensches u. d. Thierc., 40, 330 (1887). Ever since Tarkhanov's findings demonstrated sexual arousal in frogs to result from the state of seminal vesicles, the attempted elucidation of their role in other animals' sexual behaviour has been the object of experimental effort. No generalisation has yet appeared, however. The study performed by Beach & Wilson (University of California, Berkeley) in 1964 discovered that these glands do not participate in the regulation of sexual arousal of male rats in the similar manner. Whether the regularity observed in frogs is applicable to humans remains unknown. Unambiguous experimental evidence for the existence of the Tarkhanov regularity in human sexual behaviour has never been obtained.–û–±—â–∞—è —Å–µ–∫—Å–æ–ø–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è. –†—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–ª—è –≤—Ä–∞—á–µ–π (General Sexopathology: Management Manual) / –ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –ì. –°. –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ. –ú.: –ú–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω–∞, 2005. ‚Äî –°. 147. Another explanation of sexual arousal is offered by the approach which Kazimierz Imieli≈Ñski calls the \\"psychohydraulic model of sexuality.\\" This point of view likens human sexuality to a steam boiler, with biological processes or internal irritants creating sexual tension. If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly (Clarkson University) describes this model as follows: The \\"psychohydraulic model of sexuality\\" has been formulated most definitely in psychoanalysis: After a certain time, the same process begins anew. Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst. Drawing a parallel between these sensations and sexual excitation is widely accepted now: \\"Everyone must experience sexuality in some way to survive. ... In this sense sex is a necessity of life, just as air, food, and warmth.\\" And yet there is no empirical evidence in support of such a parallel, Imieli≈Ñski says. Sensations of hunger and thirst occur due to certain states of physiological insufficiency. The feeling of hunger results from the lack of glucose, fats and amino acids in blood. The feeling of thirst occurs in response to reduction of the water content of tissues. None of similar states of physiological deficiency responsible for the periodical appearance of sexual arousal has been revealed in human sexuality.–ò–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ö.. –°–µ–∫—Å–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –∏ —Å–µ–∫—Å–æ–ø–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è (Sexology a.

(Chapter III, the section \\"Models of Sexuality\\") Males The most obvious response involved with sexual behaviour in males is penile erection. The use of the volume (or circumference) change during penile erection as a convenient measure of sexual arousal was first developed by Kurt Freund.Freund, \\"A note on the use of the phallometric method of measuring mild sexual arousal in the male\\", \\"Behavior therapy\\", 1971 This measurement of blood flow to the male genitals is known as penile plethysmography. This is commonly measured using a strain gauge, a simple mercury strain gauge encompassed in a ring of rubber. The ring surrounds the penis, but does not constrict or cause discomfort. The measure has been found by some to be a reliable and valid measurement of male arousal. More recently, thermography has been developed to measure the physiological measurements of sexual arousal. Studies have found temperature change specific to the genitals during sexual arousal, which supports the validity of this measure. Females Sexual arousal in women is characterized by vasocongestion of the genital tissues, including internal and external areas (e.g., vaginal walls, clitoris, and labia). There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. Vaginal photoplethysmography (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. Clitoral photoplethysmography functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. Thermography provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in temperature associated with increased blood flow to the external genital tissues. Similarly, labial thermistor clips measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, laser doppler imaging (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues. ==Category- specificity== Category-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with. Sexual arousal studies involving category-specificity look at genital responses (physiological changes), as well as subjective responses (what people report their arousal levels to be). Category-specific sexual arousal is more commonly found amongst men than women. Heterosexual men experience much higher genital and subjective arousal to women than to men. This pattern is reversed for homosexual men. Studies have found that women have a non-category-specific genital response pattern of sexual arousal, meaning their genital responses are only modestly related to their preferred category.Chivers, M.L., Reiger, G., Latty, E., & Bailey, J.M., \\"A sex difference in the specificity of sexual arousal\\", Psychological Science, 15(11), 736-744, 2004 On the other hand, female subjective responses are category-specific, because they typically report their highest level of arousal to their preferred stimulus, although the reported difference in levels of arousal is typically much smaller than those in men. A possible explanation for the non-category specific genital arousal in women, which also accounts for their high individual variation, is the \\"preparation hypothesis\\". This hypothesis suggests that, provided there is enough of an increase in vaginal blood flow for vaginal lubrication to occur in a sexual context, the magnitude of arousal need not be consistent. That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is non-consensual. Other researchers argue that since the research is done on people who volunteer to be studied, the observed levels of category specificity may not represent the population, that there may be different cultural expectations of sexual interests being linked to genital arousal that make men with non-category specific genital arousal less likely to appear as test subjects. There researchers also argue that the assumption that men are always sexually interested in what causes genital arousal removes its own falsifiability by explaining all contradictory data away as \\"denial\\", making the theory untestable.Research Methods in Psychiatry, third edition. Chris Freeman, Peter J.Issues in Psychology and Psychiatry Research and Practice: 2013 Edition. Q Ashton Acton Overlapping brain variables and sexual arousal While there is disagreement among neurologists on whether or not it is possible to categorically distinguish male brains and female brains by measuring many variables in the brain, neurologists agree that all single variables in the brain display more individual variation and overlap between the sexes than differences between the sexes. For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic October 23, 2015Multivariate revisit to ‚Äúsex beyond the genitalia‚Äù ==Concordance== Sexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed concordance. Research has shown a reliable gender difference in concordance of sexual arousal, such that men have a higher level of concordance between genital and subjective sexual responding than women do. Some researchers argue that this gender difference can be attributed to the type of method used to assess genital responding in women. There may be a difference in women's ability to perceive internal versus external genital engorgement subjectively, as measured by vaginal photoplethysmography (VPG) and thermography respectively. Chivers and colleagues found that men's and women's concordance was more similar when thermography was used as a measure of genital sexual arousal than when VPG was used. However, few studies using thermography have been conducted and further research is required to determine whether the gender difference in concordance is a measurement artifact or a true phenomenon. ==Hormones== Several hormones affect sexual arousal, including testosterone, cortisol, and estradiol. However, the specific roles of these hormones are not clear.Bancroft, J., \\"The endocrinology of sexual arousal\\", \\"Journal of Endocrinology, 2005 Testosterone is the most commonly studied hormone involved with sexuality. It plays a key role in sexual arousal in males, with strong effects on central arousal mechanisms. The connection between testosterone and sexual arousal is more complex in females. Research has found testosterone levels increase as a result of sexual cognitions in females that do not use hormonal contraception. Also, women who participate in polyandrous relationships have higher levels of testosterone. However, it is unclear whether higher levels of testosterone cause increased arousal and in turn multiple partners or whether sexual activity with multiple partners cause the increase in testosterone. Inconsistent study results point to the idea that while testosterone may play a role in the sexuality of some women, its effects can be obscured by the co- existence of psychological or affective factors in others. ==Other animals== Two birds that appear to be exhibiting affection While human sexuality is well understood, scientists do not completely grasp how other animals relate sexually. However, current research studies suggest that many animals, like humans, enjoy sexual relations that are not limited to reproduction. Dolphins and bonobos, for example, are both well known to use sex as a \\"social tool to strengthen and maintain bonds.\\" \\"Like humans and some chimpanzees, dolphins use sex for reasons other than procreation. Sex is as frequent as it is casual, a social tool used to strengthen and maintain bonds.\\" Ethologists have long documented the exchanges of sex to promote group cohesion in social animals. Cementing social bondage is one of the most prominent theorized selective advantages of group selection theory. Experts in the evolution of sex such as John Maynard Smith advocate for the idea that the exchange of sexual favors helps congeal and localize the assortment of alleles in isolated population and therefore is potentially a very strong force in evolution. Maynard Smith has also written extensively on the \\"seminal fluid swapping theory\\" logistic application of the assortment of alleles as a more accurate synthetic depiction of the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg principle in cases of severely interbreeding populations. ==Evolutionary models== The effect of sexual response is thought to be a plastic positive reinforcement behavior modifier associated with the Baldwin effect. The display of secondary sex characteristics in humans such as a penis-like enlarged clitoris in females during arousal and gynecomastia in males are thought to have once been objects of mate selection in human evolution because of the persistence of the phenomenon of these features invoking sexual arousal for potential mates in cross-cultural studies. A dramatic example of this is the high rates of secondary sex characteristic dimorphism in some Southeast Asia human populations.Harpending, Henry \\"Human Diversity and its History\\" (Bibliographic Guide to East Asian Studies, by Gale Group, Gale Group, 2001, , ) Similar evolutionary stimuli may also have resulted in novel structures such as the pseudo-penis of the female spotted hyena. ==See also== * Aphrodisiac * Erectile tissue * Kinsey Reports * Nudity and sexuality * Priapism * Sexology * Sexual frustration == References  * ","title":"Sexual arousal"},{"id":"35334451","text":"Overland is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hamilton County, Nebraska, United States.

The stated aim of the bill is to help the U.S. government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security of networks against cyberattacks. The legislation was introduced on November 30, 2011, by Representative Michael Rogers (R-MI) and 111 co- sponsors. It was passed in the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012, but was not passed by the U.S. Senate. President Barack Obama's advisers have argued that the bill lacks confidentiality and civil liberties safeguards, and the White House said he would veto it. In February 2013, the House reintroduced the bill\\"CISPA Cybersecurity Bill, Reborn: 6 Key Facts\\", Mathew J. Schwartz, Information Week, February 14, 2013 and it passed in the United States House of Representatives on April 18, 2013,\\"FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 117\\". Retrieved April 18, 2013 but stalled and was not voted upon by the Senate. On July 10, 2014 a similar bill, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), was introduced in the Senate.\\"Controversial Cybersecurity Bill Known As CISA Advances Out Of Senate Committee\\", Gregory S. McNeal, Forbes, July 9, 2014. In January 2015, the House reintroduced the bill again. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Intelligence, and as of February 2, 2015 to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and Subcommittee on Constitution and Civil Justice to see if it will come to the House for a vote. In December 2015 a version of CISPA was hidden in the total federal budget. CISPA had garnered favor from corporations and lobbying groups such as Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T;, IBM, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, which look on it as a simple and effective means of sharing important cyber threat information with the government. It has however been criticized by advocates of Internet privacy and civil liberties, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Free Press, Fight for the Future, and Avaaz.org, as well as various conservative and libertarian groups including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, TechFreedom, FreedomWorks, Americans for Limited Government, Liberty Coalition, and the American Conservative Union. Those groups argue CISPA contains too few limits on how and when the government may monitor a private individual‚Äôs Internet browsing information. Additionally, they fear that such new powers could be used to spy on the general public rather than to pursue malicious hackers.5 Reasons the CISPA Cybersecurity Bill Should Be Tossed Time Techland, By Matt Peckham Some critics saw wording included in CISPA as a second attempt to protect intellectual property after the Stop Online Piracy Act was taken off the table by Congress after it met opposition. Intellectual property theft was initially listed in the bill as a possible cause for sharing Web traffic information with the government, though it was removed in subsequent drafts. ==Content== CISPA is an amendment to the National Security Act of 1947, which does not currently contain provisions pertaining to cybercrime. It adds provisions to the Act describing cyber threat intelligence as \\"information in the possession of an element of the intelligence community directly pertaining to a vulnerability of, or threat to, a system or network of a government or private entity, including information pertaining to the protection of a system or network from either \\"efforts to degrade, disrupt, or destroy such system or network\\".H.R. 3523 Discussion Draft - U.S. House of Representatives - November 29, 2011 In addition, CISPA requires the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to allow intelligence community elements to share cyber threat intelligence with private-sector entities and encourage the sharing of such intelligence. In an April 16, 2012, press release, the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence announced the approval of several amendments to CISPA, including the addition of a new provision \\"to permit federal lawsuits against the government for any violation of restrictions placed on the government‚Äôs use of voluntarily shared information, including the important privacy and civil liberties protections contained in the bill,\\" the inclusion of an anti-tasking provision to \\"explicitly prohibit the government from conditioning its sharing of cyber threat intelligence on the sharing of private sector information with the government\\", and the prevention of the government from using the information for \\"any other lawful purpose unless the government already has a significant cybersecurity or national security purpose in using the information\\". Relevant provisions were also clarified to \\"focus on the fact that the bill is designed to protect against unauthorized access to networks or systems, including unauthorized access aimed at stealing private or government information\\". In addition, already collected cyberthreat data can also be used to investigate \\"the imminent threat of bodily harm to an individual\\" or \\"the exploitation of a minor,\\" bringing the bill into line with existing law codified by the Patriot Act and the PROTECT Our Children Act in which these two conditions already allow for protected entities to share data voluntarily with the United States government, law enforcement agencies, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. ==Recent developments== Bill sponsors Mike Rogers and Dutch Ruppersberger, the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, respectively, said on April 25, 2012, that the Obama administration's opposition is mostly based on the lack of critical infrastructure regulation, something outside of the jurisdiction of the Intelligence committee; they have also since introduced a package of amendments to the legislation that, \\"address nearly every single one of the criticisms leveled by the Administration, particularly those regarding privacy and civil liberties of Americans\\". Due to the opposition the bill has experienced, the co-sponsors are planning to amend the bill to address many of the concerns of its opponents‚Äîincluding limiting its scope to a narrower definition of cyber-threats, and stating that the \\"theft of intellectual property\\" refers to the theft of research and development. In addition, there will now be penalties if private companies or the government uses data from CISPA for purposes \\"unrelated to cyberthreats\\".New CISPA amendments expected - but the fight will go on - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012CISPA and SOPA like 'apples and oranges,' say chief co-sponsors - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012 However, Sharan Bradford Franklin, of the Constitution Project states, \\"Although we appreciate the Intelligence Committee's efforts to improve the bill and willingness to engage in a dialogue with privacy advocates, the changes in its most current draft do not come close to addressing the civil liberties threats posed by the bill, and some of the proposals would actually make CISPA worse. Therefore, Congress should not pass CISPA\\". Rainey Reitman, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation states, \\"To date, the authors of the bill have been unresponsive to these criticisms, offering amendments that are largely cosmetic. Dismissing the grave concerns about how this bill could undermine the core privacy rights of everyday Internet users, Rep. Mike Rogers characterized the growing protests against CISPA as 'turbulence' and vowed to push for a floor vote without radical changes.\\" Kendall Burman of the Center for Democracy and Technology states, \\"The authors of CISPA have made some positive changes recently. Unfortunately, none of the changes gets to the heart of the privacy concerns that Internet users and advocacy groups have expressed.\\" In April 2012, the Office of Management and Budget of the Executive Office of the President of the United States released a statement strongly opposing the current bill and recommending to veto it.Statement of Administration Policy - H.R. 3523 - Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act - Office of Management and Budget, April 25, 2012. On April 26, 2012, the House of Representatives passed CISPA. On February 13, 2013, United States Representative Mike Rogers reintroduced the CISPA bill in the 113th Congress as H.R. 624. On April 18, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 624. The Senate has reportedly refused to vote on the measure and is drafting competing legislation. On July 10, 2014 a similar bill, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), was introduced in the Senate.

Google has not taken a public position on the bill but has shown previous support for it, and now says they support the idea but believe the bill needs some work. Leading Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft executives are also on the executive council of TechNet, a tech trade group which sent a letter supporting CISPA in April 2013. ==Opposition== *Former Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) has publicly opposed the bill calling it \\"Big Brother writ large.\\" *36 groups currently oppose CISPA with an addition of 6 groups as of April 21. The Electronic Frontier Foundation lists a growing list of opposition as well as a list of security experts, academics, and engineers in opposition of the bill. They also published the statement Don‚Äôt Let Congress Use \\"Cybersecurity\\" Fears to Erode Digital Rights. *Opposition to CISPA includes more than 840,000 online petitioners who have signed global civic organization Avaaz.org's petition to members of the US Congress entitled \\"Save the Internet from the US\\". Avaaz also has a petition to Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM entitled \\"The end of Internet privacy\\", signed by more than 840,000 people. *The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) published a statement titled \\"Cybersecurity's 7-Step Plan for Internet Freedom\\". The CDT openly opposes the Mike Rogers bill based on these 7-step criteria. The CDT has also openly supported a competing bill in the house sponsored by Representative Dan Lungren (R-CA) that has yet to be reported by the committee. *The Constitution Project (TCP) \\"believes cybersecurity legislation currently pending before Congress possess major risks to civil liberties that must be addressed before any bill is enacted into law.\\" *The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has also issued a statement opposing the bill stating, \\"The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act would create a cybersecurity exception to all privacy laws and allow companies to share the private and personal data they hold on their American customers with the government for cybersecurity purposes.\\" As the statement continues, \\"Beyond the potential for massive data collection authorization, the bill would provide no meaningful oversight of, or accountability for, the use of these new information-sharing authorities.\\" *The Sunlight Foundation states, \\"The new cybersecurity bill, CISPA, or HR 3523, is terrible on transparency. The bill proposes broad new information collection and sharing powers (which many other organizations are covering at length). Even as the bill proposes those powers, it proposes to limit public oversight of this work.\\" *Cenk Uygur, from Current TV, opposed the bill highlighted one of Mike Rogers' speech about the bill to the business community. He also attempted to summarize the bill to his audience. *Demand Progress opposes CISPA, stating \\"The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or CISPA, would obliterate any semblance of online privacy in the United States.\\" *Competitive Enterprise Institute joins with TechFreedom, FreedomWorks, Americans for Limited Government, Liberty Coalition, Al Cardenas, and American Conservative Union to write a letter to Congress. Competitive Enterprise Institute states, \\"Despite the bill's noble intentions, however, it risks unduly expanding federal power, undermining freedom of contract, and harming U.S. competitiveness in the technology sector.\\" The Competitive Enterprise Institute lists 6 problems within the bill itself and how to fix those problems. *Reporters Without Borders states, \\"Reporters Without Borders is deeply concerned with the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011 (CISPA), the cyber security bill now before the US Congress. In the name of the war on cyber crime, it would allow the government and private companies to deploy draconian measures to monitor, even censor, the Web. It might even be used to close down sites that publish classified files or information.\\" *testPAC opposes CISPA stating \\"CISPA would effectively take the door off the hinge of every household in America, but lacks the tools necessary to distinguish whether there is a criminal hiding in the attic. Why surrender the core of our privacy for the sake of corporate and governmental convenience?\\" *Mozilla, the makers of the Firefox Web-Browser, opposes CISPA stating, \\"While we wholeheartedly support a more secure Internet, CISPA has a broad and alarming reach that goes far beyond Internet security.\\" *The Association for Computing Machinery believes that \\"More effective information sharing in support of cybersecurity is a laudable goal, but CISPA is seriously flawed in its approach to PII. Better approaches to information sharing are certainly possible if privacy goals are also considered.\\" *IGDA, the International Game Developers Association is against this bill, urging Congress and the President to reject it saying, in part, \\"The version of CISPA which just emerged from the House Intelligence Committee does not address the privacy failings in the previous version, which the White House wisely rejected. The bill still retains its dangerously over-broad language, still lacks civilian control, still lacks judicial oversight, and still lacks clear limits on government monitoring of our Internet browsing information. The House should vote against it.\\" *The Libertarian Party protested it by blacking out much of their Facebook, and encouraged others to follow suit. Week of action Dubbed the \\"Stop Cyber Spying Week\\", starting on April 16, 2012, many civil liberties groups and advocates raised the awareness of CISPA (through a Twitter campaign with the hash-tags #CISPA and #CongressTMI,) including, but not limited to, the Constitution Project, American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Democracy and Technology, Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, Free Press, Reporters Without Borders, Sunlight Foundation, and TechFreedom. Blackout day Anonymous, a hacktivist group, has criticized the bill and called for an \\"Internet blackout day\\" to protest the bill. The date of the blackout was April 22, 2013. ==Prior attempts for U.S. cybersecurity bills== Since legislation must pass the House and the Senate within the same Congress, anything introduced during the 112th or earlier Congresses has to pass both chambers again. Senate * (Secure IT), introduced by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) on March 1, 2012. * (Cybersecurity Act), reported by committee on February 15, 2012. Sponsored by Senator Joseph Lieberman (I-CT). Failing to gain enough support for passage, the bill, entitled \\"Cybersecurity Act of 2012\\", was reintroduced on July 19, 2012 in a revised form which omitted federal imposition of security standards on IP providers, as well as including stronger privacy and civil liberties protections. House of Representatives * (Precise Act), reported by committee April 18, 2012 by Representative Dan Lungren (R-CA).

The current holder is Great Western Railway. ==History== In 2003, as part of a franchise reorganisation by the Strategic Rail Authority, it was announced that the Great Western, Thames Trains and Wessex Trains franchises would be combined to form the Greater Western Franchise. This was part of a strategy to reduce the number of train operating companies providing services from a single London terminal, in order to improve efficiency and reliability. In April 2005, the Authority announced that FirstGroup, National Express and Stagecoach had been shortlisted to bid for the new franchise. In December 2005 the Department for Transport awarded the franchise to FirstGroup, with the services operated by First Great Western, First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains transferred to First Great Western on 1 April 2006. The franchise was for ten years with the last three years being optional. Unusually this option could be exercised by either party; elsewhere these options are at the sole discretion of the Department for Transport. On 14 May 2011, First announced it would not be taking up the option, with the franchise to end on 31 March 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. In January 2013 the government announced the franchise competition had been cancelled, with the existing franchise extended until 12 October 2013 when it would be terminated. Negotiations took place with First in January 2013 for it to run the franchise on a management contract basis for two years.Rail franchising future programme Department for Transport 31 January 2013 A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. An extension to April 2019 was granted in March 2015. In 2016 an extension to March 2020 was announced on the First Group website, and this was confirmed by the government in November 2017, along with an intention to discuss with First a continuation until March 2022. ==Cancelled 2013 franchise competition== Arriva, Stagecoach, First and National Express Expressions of interest in bidding for the new franchise were called for in December 2011 and in March 2012 it was announced that Arriva UK Trains, FirstGroup, National Express and Stagecoach had been shortlisted to bid. The winner was to be announced in December 2012, with the new franchisee taking over in April 2013, however, it was announced in July 2012 that the franchise would be extended due to the late issue of the invitation to tender (ITT). The ITT was released at the end of July 2012, with bids to be submitted in October 2012, the winner announced in March 2013, and operations commence on 21 July 2013. However, in the wake of the InterCity West Coast refranchising process collapsing, the government announced in October 2012 that the process would be put on hold pending the results of a review. The new franchise was to have run for 15 years and seen the introduction of new InterCity Express Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing. ==Possible future services== In October 2013, a document released by the government which described the economic case for High Speed 2 (HS2) included indications of future plans for the national rail network, as a 'Do Minimum' baseline against which HS2 was compared. The assumptions for the Greater Western franchise included: * introduction of a service between and London Paddington; * reduction in services between and Paddington, in favour of Chiltern Railways service between and Oxford; * removal of services starting at Paddington and ending at ; * the replacement of local services between Paddington and by an extended Heathrow Express service from , using a proposed western access to Heathrow; * doubling the service frequency between and Paddington; * increasing service frequency between Paddington and ; * increasing service frequency between Paddington and . ==Future of the franchise== In November 2017, the government announced it was considering splitting the franchise, to create a new West of England franchise to provide long-distance services between London, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, together with local and regional services across the south-west. This proposal was dropped by the Department for Transport after a consultation. At the same time, the government confirmed its intention to extend the franchise to March 2020, and proposed a further extension to March 2022. In March 2020, a further extension to 31 March 2023 was awarded by the DfT with an option to extend for a further year.Critical rail services protected in new GWR and Southeastern Department for Transport 30 March 2020FirstGroup says new Great Western contract has appropriate balance of risk and reward Railway Gazette International 30 March 2020 ==References== Category:Railway franchises in the United Kingdom ","title":"Greater Western franchise"},{"id":"35334572","text":"Dark Girls is a 2011 documentary film by Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry. It documents colorism within the African American community, a subject still considered taboo by many black Americans. The film contains interviews of African American women describing the role colorism has played in their lives, with notable African Americans including Viola Davis also detailing her experience. It also reports on a new version of the 1940s black doll experiment by Kenneth and Mamie Clark, which proved that black children had internalized racism by having children select a white or a black doll (they typically chose white) based on questions asked. In the updated version, black children favored light-skinned dolls over dark-skinned dolls. ==Scenes== \\"I don't like to be called black because I'm not black,\\" were the opening words of a young African American girl at the beginning of Dark Girls. Dark Girls explores the many struggles, including self-esteem issues, which women of darker skin face as a result of the colorism they have experienced, allowing women of all ages recount \\"the damage done to their self-esteem and their constant feeling of being devalued and disregarded.‚Äù(Haque) Duke and Berry even take it a step farther and interview different groups of African American get an insight on dating preferences that are present in the African American community.

Duke and Berry also examine how black women are trying to look more Caucasian while white women are trying to look more ethnic. ‚ÄúWhite women are risking skin cancer and tanning booths twice a week, botoxing their lips, getting butt lifts to look more ethnic and crinkling up their hair.‚Äù ==Impact== The film was shown to a sell-out crowd at the Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles, April 2012. In an interview on NPR, Duke recounted a reaction he received at another showing which indicated that colorism is not easily discussed. He was asked, 'Why are you airing our dirty laundry?'

It was formed on 26 May 1996, following the privatisation of British Rail and the franchise was originally called London, Tilbury and Southend. The only train operating company on the line to date has been c2c. Following a number of temporary extensions caused by problems with the rail franchising system, c2c was awarded a new 15-year franchise which commenced on 9 November 2014. As part of an abandoned round of re-franchising, bids were received from the shortlisted parties in September 2012 with a winner expected to be announced in January 2013. In October 2012 the government announced the refranchising process would be put on hold, pending a review of the franchising system and the failures of the InterCity West Coast franchising process. In January 2013 the government announced a revised invitation to tender would be issued in summer 2013 with an interim contract for up to two years to be negotiated with National Express.

It was for the provision of all regular services, and management of 25 stations, from Fenchurch Street along the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway line to Shoeburyness, including a loop line via Rainham and a branch line via Ockendon. The franchise was due to commence in February 1996 but because of allegations of ticketing and settlement irregularities with the preferred bidder, Enterprise Rail, was re- tendered. In May 1996 the franchise was awarded to Prism Rail by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising for 15 years with an average annual subsidy of ¬£18.4 million and commenced operating as LTS Rail on 26 May 1996. In July 2000 Prism Rail was purchased by National Express. An additional stop under the management of London Underground was opened on the route at West Ham in 1999. In 2002 responsibility for managing the main terminal station at Fenchurch Street transferred from the franchisee to Network Rail and in July that year the train operator was rebranded c2c. 1998 renegotiation In 1998 the franchise was renegotiated to provide for: * Slam door rolling stock replaced by Class 357s and the fleet to increase by at least twelve vehicles by March 2002 * Increased staffing of stations, real-time passenger information system, and improved security measures including Secure Stations Scheme accreditation * Improved station facilities for disabled people and increased cycle storage * Pedestrian access from Chafford Hundred railway station to Lakeside Shopping Centre Abandoned 2011 renewal and extension to 2013 The franchise, now renamed Essex Thameside, was due to be renewed on 29 May 2011 and the consultation process began in 2009. However following the 2010 United Kingdom General Election there was a change of government and the franchise renewal process was delayed so it could be reviewed. On 23 December 2010 the Department for Transport granted National Express an extension until 26 May 2013. Abandoned 2013 renewal and extension to 2014 On 29 March 2012 the Department for Transport announced that Abellio, First, MTR and National Express had been shortlisted for the Essex Thameside franchise. On 2 July 2012 the Department for Transport issued the invitation to tender to the shortlisted bidders for a new 15 year franchise. The bids were submitted on 27 September and the successful bidder was expected to be announced in January 2013, but in October 2012 the government halted all ongoing franchise competitions to allow reviews to take place into the franching process, following the failed InterCity West Coast renewal.

In February 2017 National Express sold the operating company c2c to Trenitalia. The minimum train service requirement for the franchise for 07:00-21:59 Monday to Friday and 09:00-19:59 on Saturday is as follows: * 8 trains per hour at Fenchurch Street, West Ham and Barking * 6 trains per hour at Limehouse * 4 trains per hour at Upminster, Grays, Laindon, Basildon, Pitsea, Benfleet, Leigh, Chalkwell, Westcliff, Southend Central * 3 trains per hour at Southend East, Thorpe Bay, Shoeburyness * 2 trains per hour at Dagenham Dock, Rainham, Purfleet, West Horndon, Ockendon, Chafford Hundred The train service requirement is met if a service calls at Stratford and Liverpool Street instead of Fenchurch Street and Limehouse. Responsibility for upkeep of stations is to be transferred from Network Rail to the train operator under the new franchise. The new operator will manage all stations on the route except Liverpool Street (to remain under Network Rail operation), Stratford and West Ham (both TfL). Fenchurch Street will transfer from Network Rail management to the new operator. The operator is required to implement ITSO-compliant smartcard tickets within five years.

All five creations are extinct, as is the Tyrell baronetcy. The six creations all claim a descent from Walter Tirell, the reputed accidental killer of King William II. The Tyrrell Baronetcy, of Thornton in the County of Buckingham, was created in the Baronetage of England on 31 October 1627 for Edward Tyrrell. On 19 February 1638 he surrendered the title to the Crown and obtained a second patent with remainder to his second son Toby (barring his eldest son Robert from succeeding), with the precedence of the earlier creation. However, the House of Lords decided that this was unlawful. There were consequently two creations of the baronetcy. The eldest son Robert succeeded in the 1627 creation while his younger brother Toby succeeded in the 1638 creation. Sir Robert died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother, Toby. The titles became extinct on the death of the seventh Baronet in 1749. The Tyrrell Baronetcy, of Hanslape in the County of Buckingham, was created in the Baronetage of England on 20 July 1665 for Peter Tyrrell. He was the younger son of Sir Thomas Tyrrell, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. The title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet in 1714. The Tirell, later Tyrrell Baronetcy, of Springfield in the County of Essex, was created in the Baronetage of England on 22 October 1666 for John Tirell. They were members of the same family as the Tyrrell Baronets of Thornton. The second and subsequent baronets used the surname Tyrrell. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth Baronet in 1766. The Tyrrell Baronetcy, of Lynn in the County of Westmeath, was created in the Baronetage of England on 20 May 1686 for Edward Tyrrell. The title became extinct on his death in 1691. ==Tyrrell baronets, of Thornton (1627)== *Sir Edward Tyrrell, 1st Baronet (died 1656) *Sir Robert Tyrrell, 2nd Baronet *Sir Toby Tyrrell, 3rd Baronet (died 1671) *Sir Thomas Tyrrell, 4th Baronet (died 1705) *Sir Harry Tyrrell, 5th Baronet (c. 1670‚Äì1708) *Sir Thomas Tyrrell, 6th Baronet (c. 1693‚Äì1718) *Sir Harry Tyrrell, 7th Baronet (c. 1695‚Äì1720) *Sir Charles Tyrrell, 8th Baronet (1708‚Äì1749) ==Tyrrell baronets, of Thornton (1638)== *Sir Edward Tyrrell, 1st Baronet (died 1656) *Sir Toby Tyrrell, 2nd Baronet (died 1671) *Sir Thomas Tyrrell, 3rd Baronet (died 1705) *Sir Harry Tyrrell, 4th Baronet (c. 1670‚Äì1708) *Sir Thomas Tyrrell, 5th Baronet (c. 1693‚Äì1718) *Sir Harry Tyrrell, 6th Baronet (c. 1695‚Äì1720) *Sir Charles Tyrrell, 7th Baronet (1708‚Äì1749) ==Tyrrell baronets, of Hanslape (1665)== *Sir Peter Tyrrell, 1st Baronet (died 1711) *Sir Thomas Tyrrell, 2nd Baronet (c. 1670‚Äì1714) ==Tyrrell baronets, of Springfield (1666)== *Sir John Tirell, 1st Baronet (c. 1636‚Äì1673) *Sir Charles Tyrrell, 2nd Baronet (c. 1660‚Äì1715) *Sir John Tyrrell, 3rd Baronet (c. 1685‚Äì1729) *Sir Charles Tyrrell, 4th Baronet (c. 1725‚Äì1735) *Sir John Tyrrell, 5th Baronet (c. 1728‚Äì1766) ==Tyrrell baronets, of Lynn (1686)== *Sir Edward Tyrrell, 1st Baronet (died 1691) ==See also== * Tyrell Baronets ==References== * Category:Extinct baronetcies in the Baronetage of England Category:1627 establishments in England ","title":"Tyrrell baronets"},{"id":"35334669","text":"Wyoma was an unincorporated community located in Mason County, West Virginia, United States.

He married in 1339 or 1340 to Matilda, a daughter of Duke Otto III of Brunswick-Luneburg. They had at least two children: * Henry VI, Otto's successor * Sophie, a nun at Volkhardinghausen monastery Matilda died in 1357 or earlier. Soon after her death, Otto married his second wife, Margaret, the widow of Heinemann of Itter (d. 1356). No children from this marriage are known. == Reign== Otto II was co-regent with his father from 1332. His father withdrew from government in 1344, allowing Otto II to rule alone. In 1345, he concluded an everlasting covenant with Archbishop Henry III of Mainz. Just as during his father's reign, there were disputes with the archbishops of Cologne in their capacity as dukes of Westphalia. A compromise was reached in 1346. In 1349, Emperor Charles IV enfeoffed Otto with the County of Waldeck. This implied that he was elevated to Imperial Count. After his father-in-law, Duke Otto III of Brunswick- L√ºneburg, died without a male heir, Otto claimed his inheritance. However, Otto III's younger brother William II managed to secure the Principality of L√ºneburg. Emperor Charles IV ordered William II to pay Otto II an indemnity of , which was about half the principality's value. However, William II never paid. After Archbishop Gerlach of Mainz and Landgrave Hesse had taken the larger part of the Lordship of Itter in 1357, Gerlach mortgaged his share to Otto II for 1000 Marks carat silver. In 1381, Otto mortgaged this share of Itter to Thile I Wolf of Guldenberg, who mortgaged the Hesse share of Itter two years later. His descendants retained Itter well into the 16th century. Waldeck finally redeemed the mortgage in 1542, Hesse in 1562. On 8 July 1358, Otto, who was still reeling from the plague epidemic of 1349, commissioned the Knights Hospitaller at Wiesenfeld (now part of Burgwald to establish a hospital in Niederwildungen. He donated his old Mill Court on the Wilde river between Altwildungen and Niederwildungen for this purpose.Johann Adolph Theodor Ludwig Varnhagen: Grundlage der Waldeckischen Landes- und Regentengeschichte, G√∂ttingen, 1825, p. 387 Construction of the hospital lasted from 1358 to 1369 and became a commandry of the order in 1372. In 1368, the Archbishop of Mainz and the Landgrave of Hesse formed an alliance against Otto II and his son Henry VI, to take his castle at Wildungen. A tribunal convicted the counts of Waldeck of violating their covenant with Mainz and ordered them to pay damages. Otto II died in 1369. It is not known where he was buried. == References == * Johann Adolph Theodor Ludwig Varnhagen: Grundlage der Waldeckischen Landes- und Regentengeschichte, G√∂ttingen, 1825, p. 381‚Äì397, Online == Footnotes == Category:Counts of Waldeck Category:14th- century births Category:1369 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:14th-century German people ","title":"Otto II, Count of Waldeck"},{"id":"35334708","text":"Medical device reporting (MDR) is the procedure for the Food and Drug Administration to get significant medical device adverse events information from manufacturers, importers and user facilities, so these issues can be detected and corrected quickly, and the same lot of that product may be recalled. Consumers and health professionals report any adverse event caused by the device to MedWatch program for reporting significant adverse events or product problems with medical products. ==History== Legislation requiring device user facility reporting was enacted by Congress to increase the amount of information the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and device manufacturers receive about problems with medical devices. Although manufacturers and importers of medical devices have been required since 1984 to report to FDA all device-related deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions, numerous studies have shown widespread underreporting. A 1986 General Accounting Office (GAO) study showed that less than one percent of device problems occurring in hospitals are reported to the FDA, and that the more serious the problem with a device, the less likely it was to be reported. A GAO follow-up study in 1989 concluded that despite full implementation of the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, serious shortcomings still existed. Under the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA), device user facilities must report device-related deaths to the FDA and the manufacturer, if known. The facilities must also report device-related serious injuries to the manufacturer, or to the FDA if the manufacturer is not known. In addition, SMDA also required that device user facilities submit to FDA, on a semiannual basis, a summary of all reports submitted during that time period. The device user facility reporting section of SMDA became effective on November 28, 1991. To implement SMDA, FDA published a tentative final rule in the Federal Register on November 26, 1991, inviting comments; over 300 comments were received. On June 16, 1992, the President signed into law the Medical Devices Amendments of 1992 (Public Law 102-300) making minor changes.

Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614 (1985), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning arbitration of antitrust claims. The Court heard the case on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which had ruled that the arbitration clause in a Puerto Rican car dealer's franchise agreement was broad enough to reach its antitrust claim. By a 5‚Äì3 margin it upheld the lower court, requiring that the dealer arbitrate its claim before a panel in Tokyo, as stipulated in the contract. Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) was broad enough to require arbitration of statutory claims as well as contractual ones, extending a recent line of Court decisions favorable to arbitration. A controversial footnote, creating a possible \\"prospective waiver\\" doctrine that would allow a party to avoid arbitration under foreign law, has been much criticized by commentators and at the same time raised by many litigants. In 2009 the Eleventh Circuit found it valid for an injured cruise-ship worker, but two years later cast doubt on that conclusion. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that antitrust claims were too complex and important to be left to arbitrators and that in any event none of the claims were arbitrable under the terms of the contract itself. He expressed incredulousness that his colleagues would require an American company to arbitrate a claim under American antitrust law before a panel of foreign arbitrators. While the case formed an important part of the Court's expansion of arbitrability in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it could not have reached a court today. In 2002, after years of lobbying by the National Automobile Dealers Association, Congress passed the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act, which prohibited mandatory predispute arbitration clauses in motor vehicle dealership franchise agreements. President George W. Bush signed it into law, the first time a specific exception to the FAA had been legislated since the Court began expanding its scope. ==Underlying dispute== In 1979 Soler was incorporated in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and became a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer, doing business in the Pueblo Viejo district of the nearby suburb of Guaynabo.Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth (Mitsubishi Motors II), , at 617, Blackmun, J. It and Mitsubishi Motors, a joint venture of Chrysler and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, incorporated in Geneva, Switzerland, concluded two separate agreements to this effect: a distributor agreement with Chrysler and separate sales procedure agreements with Chrysler and Mitsubishi. The latter contained arbitration clauses requiring that any disputes under them be arbitrated in Japan under the rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association (JCAA).Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. (Mitsubishi Motors I), 723 F.2d 155 (1st Cir., 1983) at 157. The goal of the manufacturer and dealer was to introduce the small cars Mitsubishi made for both Chrysler and itself to the Puerto Rican market, for which they were considered ideal. Soler did excellent business in its first two years, selling more than twice the number of vehicles set in its quota. As the market began to slow down in late 1981, the relationship between Soler and Mitsubishi began to break down. The dealer had trouble meeting sales targets under a higher quota, and Mitsubishi withheld shipments of new vehicles. Eventually 966 destined for Soler were stored near its factories in Japan. Soler began having trouble financing its purchases of new vehicles. alt=Three red diamonds arranged in a triangular pattern with the words \\"Mitsubishi Motors\\" in black beneath Seeing that other Japanese car makers were allowing their dealers in Puerto Rico to transship excess inventory to Latin America and the continental United States, Soler asked if it could do the same. Mitsubishi refused, saying the vehicles were customized for the Puerto Rican market. They lacked heaters and defoggers that they would have needed on the mainland, and their engines could not run on the lower-grade leaded gasoline sold in many Latin American countries at that time. Further, Soler had no experience with maritime shipping and would not been able to meet its service obligations under warranty for transshipped cars and trucks. Mitsubishi also was concerned that transshipments to the continental U.S. would be seen as skirting the voluntary import restraints Japanese automakers had been practicing in the American market to mitigate the potential political backlash from their distressed American counterparts.Mitsubishi Motors II, at 618n1. Soler would later claim that it was told the real reason for the refusal to allow transshipping was that Mitsubishi and Chrysler had divided their territories, informally agreeing that the former brand would have preference outside the mainland U.S. while Chrysler maintained it domestically. The dealership then began to suspect that Mitsubishi intended to sabotage its business in order to replace it with a wholly owned subsidiary once the brand had been established in Puerto Rico. Early in 1982 Soler stopped paying storage costs for the vehicles in Japan, claiming it had disowned them.Mitsubishi Motors I, at 160. Later that year the franchise agreement either ended or was terminated. ==Lower courts== Mitsubishi sued in federal district court for Puerto Rico, alleging various breaches of the sales procedure agreement. Soler countersued, alleging violations of the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, which allowed civil suits by dealerships for damage due to bad faith on the part of the franchisor.P.L. 84-1026, Aug. 8, 1956, ch. 1038, 70 Stat. 1125 (). and its equivalent territorial statute. They also included antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, claiming that Mitsubishi was purposely driving it out of the motor vehicle retail business with the intent of replacing Soler with its own wholly owned subsidiary.Mitsubishi Motors I, at 158. Mitsubishi's response was a motion to the judge to compel arbitration as mandated by the agreement. The court ordered most of the contractual claims arbitrated, but reserved jurisdiction on the statutory claims alleged by Soler, including antitrust. Soler made an interlocutory appeal to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes Puerto Rico, arguing that all its statutory counterclaims were not covered by the arbitration clause, and that Sherman Act claims could not be arbitrated in any event. Appeals court In 1983 a three-judge panel of Levin H. Campbell, then the circuit's chief judge, Frank M. Coffin and Hugh Henry Bownes, heard the case. Near the end of the year they handed down their decision. Unanimously they ruled for Mitsubishi on the statutory claims, holding them within the ambit of the arbitration clause. However, they also said, the Sherman Act claims could be litigated as they were not so parochial to American law, and were too important to U.S. public policy to leave to arbitrators. Coffin wrote for the panel that although the agreement was governed by Swiss law, the scope of the arbitration clause was within the court's jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration Act preempted Puerto Rican law on the subject, which, he noted, Soler tacitly acknowledged by arguing that the Puerto Rico Dealers' Act (PRDA) was implicitly incorporated into the agreement, since it explicitly incorporated savings and separability clauses from the distributorship agreement that violated the PRDA. He called this argument \\"tortured\\", since neither was actually incorporated into the sales procedure agreement as Soler claimed. Nor was the arbitration clause limited to contractual claims.Mitsubishi Motors I, at 159. \\"Soler's Sherman Act counterclaim poses a murkier problem,\\" Coffin wrote. It rested on the claim that, by refusing to allow transshipment of unsold vehicles, Mitsubishi was dividing markets. Further anticompetitive practices alleged were wrongful termination of Soler's franchise, and the refusal to ship cars and parts. Mitsubishi responded with its practical objections to the transshipments, that the franchise had expired without being renewed and that the shipments were halted sometimes at Soler's request and sometimes for lack of an acceptable letter of credit. Most of these, Coffin concluded, were differences over the execution of the contract and therefore covered by the arbitration clause. \\"The important question now before us,\\" Coffin continued, \\"is whether, despite such coverage, they are nonarbitrable because of a judicially created policy, hitherto applied only to 'domestic' contracts involving United States citizens, reserving antitrust issues for judicial determination.\\" After oral argument, he recounted, the court had concluded this was a question of first impression and sought guidance from the federal government. The Justice Department responded with an amicus curiae brief, joined by the State Department's Legal Advisor, urging the court to uphold that tradition in this case. The First Circuit agreed.Mitsubishi Motors I, at 161‚Äì62. Coffin found three issues relevant to that determination. The policy he referred to was the Second Circuit's holding in American Safety Equipment v. J.P. Maguire & Co.: \\"We do not believe that Congress intended such claims to be resolved elsewhere than in the courts.\\"American Safety Equipment v. J.P. Maguire & Co., 391 F. 2d 821, at 827 (2nd Cir., 1968). Several other circuits had affirmed that precedent. \\"We conclude, therefore, that the nonarbitrability of antitrust issues in domestic contract disputes is established as solid and sound doctrine.\\"Mitsubishi Motors I, at 162‚Äì163. However, this was not a domestic contract dispute but one between an American company and a Japanese one, whose contract, governed by Swiss law, called for any disputes to be arbitrated in Tokyo. Coffin said there were two more questions. \\"The first is: is the American antitrust ethic and system of law so 'parochial' that insistence on the application of the nonarbitrability of antitrust issues to international agreements would be anathema to other countries and would incite retaliation?\\" This concern had motivated the Supreme Court in deciding to hold an American firm to its agreement to litigate in London.\\" in The Bremen v. Zapata Off- Shore Co., a key forum selection case.The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., . \\"We doubt that other nations are ignorant of the primacy we accord to antitrust law,\\" Coffin wrote. The government's amicus brief had advised that German law similarly prohibited disputes under its corresponding statutes from being arbitrated, and the Treaty of Rome which established what was then known as the European Union had five articles devoted to forbidding or restricting anti-competitive practices. \\"[W]hether or not other nations agree with United States law and attitudes relating to competition, it is extremely doubtful that they would describe them as 'parochial' in the sense of being petty provincialisms,\\" he concluded. The second question was whether any policy applied that would specifically prevent foreign concerns from arbitrating antitrust claims brought against them by American companies. Coffin again readily found the answer: But that conclusion was not enough. The court next had to look at that policy in light of whether it would be permitted under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, known as the New York Convention, negotiated in 1958 under United Nations auspices and acceded to by the United States in 1958. \\"[It] was preceded by very little helpful history, and followed by very little illuminating history or adjudication,\\" wrote Coffin. \\"We work with a scattering of crumbs‚Äîand, hopefully, a sound sense of the balance struck by the Convention between deeply felt national policies and the desire to facilitate international arbitration.\\" He found its language at first contradictory, requiring that any matter found arbitrable in a member country be arbitrated, but also saying that awards need not be enforced if they were found against the public policy of the country being asked to do so.\\"Mitsubishi Motors I, at 164. Coffin found guidance in resolving this problem first from an opinion he'd written in another case two years earlierLedee v. Ceramiche Ragno, 684 F. 2d 184 (1st Cir., 1982). which led him to exclude from Convention coverage those arbitration clauses found defective though fraud, mistake, duress, and waiver. This was not one of those cases. \\"The precise question we ask,\\" he wrote, \\"is whether a matter that has been barred by unanimous judicial precedent for a decade and a half from resolution by arbitration, because of a multiplicity of solid reasons that lose no pertinence or weight in an international context, is a matter 'capable of settlement by arbitration'\\". He found this very broad, as any dispute could theoretically be solved that way. For guidance, Coffin found a State Department memo to the Senate at the time of ratification to be useful. It noted that that clause was meant to account for the laws in member states that forbade certain matters from being arbitrated, and cited laws in some U.S. states that specifically applied that prohibition to real estate title disputes. Commentary on the Convention noted the same issue with the language. \\"We therefore conclude that an agreement to arbitrate antitrust issues is not 'an agreement within the meaning of' ... the Convention because such an agreement does not concern 'a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration'\\", he concluded.\\"Mitsubishi Motors I, at 165‚Äì166. There was nevertheless still \\"a considerable roadblock\\" in the form of Scherk v. Alberto‚ÄìCulver, Inc., a 1971 case where, again faced with a dispute between a domestic and a foreign company where arbitrability was at issue, the Supreme Court had ordered the parties to arbitration.Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc., . If that case were applied broadly, Coffin noted, again there would be almost no inarbitrable dispute. And, since part of the claim involved allegations of securities fraud, the respondent relied on Wilko v. Swan, where the Court had held such claims were inarbitrable.Wilko v. Swan, . Coffin distinguished the case at hand in several ways. First, the Scherk Court had not considered the case within the context of the Convention. Second, the older case had involved a dispute over the status of foreign trademarks, a decision which necessarily involved foreign law, whereas \\"the parties here could not be blind to the obvious fact that American law would normally apply to any claim of monopolization or restraint of trade\\". Third, as he had already discussed, antitrust was not a peculiar and parochial American concern. Fourth was the different policies underlying the respective laws: while the securities laws in Scherk were meant to protect individual investors, ==Before the Court== Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court. Arbitration proceedings continued, as both parties paid the fees and the JCAA assembled a panel to hear the case. In September 1984, immediately after Mitsubishi presented its case to the panel, Soler declared bankruptcy, resulting in an automatic stay.Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth (Mitsubishi Motors III), 814 F. 2d 844 (1st Cir., 1987). Shortly afterward, the Court granted certiorari. Amici briefs were filed by several parties. The American Arbitration Association urged reversal of the holding on the Sherman Act claims; the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) urged reversal of the other aspect of the holding. The Solicitor General's office filed one on behalf of the federal government in support of Soler. The International Chamber of Commerce and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico also shared their thoughts on the case in briefs. Oral argument The Court heard oral arguments in March 1985. Wayne Cross argued for Mitsubishi and Benjamin Ramon-Rodriguez for Soler. In addition, Jerrold Joseph Ganzfried was allowed some time to argue for the federal government in support of Soler. Mitsubishi Cross repeatedly asserted that there was just one question for the justices to consider: \\"Whether a party's contractual right to arbitrate antitrust disputes can be frustrated absent such a countervailing federal policy found in a federal statute.\\" In support of this he cited a case the Court had decided unanimously two weeks earlier, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, where it had upheld a request for arbitration of securities fraud claims under state law even though the parallel claims under federal law were still to be litigated.Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, . \\"The preeminent concern of Congress in passing the [FAA],\\" Cross quoted from Justice Thurgood Marshall's opinion in that case, \\"was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered, and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate ... at least absent a countervailing policy manifested in another federal statute.\\" Cross initially rebuffed efforts by the justices to ask about the issue still being argued by Soler, that the other statutory claims were non-arbitrable as well. He declined initially, reminding them that the two lower courts had held otherwise. After he was reminded that they were still making the argument, he said that he did not think it would be applicable to their specific claims. He continued to the specifics of his argument. \\"We submit that the circuit court's reliance upon the American Safety case is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act.\\" In Byrd and other recent cases, the court had affirmed \\"a strong national policy favoring arbitration,\\" as it had put it in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.,Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., , at 24. and he saw no reason to stop here. However, when challenged on how the Court could reach his desired result without overruling American Safety and thus avoid the question of whether purely domestic antitrust claims were arbitrable, he pointed the justices to Scherk. \\"I did not read [it] ... as overruling Wilko so much as a limitation on Wilko in international conduct.\\" The justices had some concerns about the international nature of the case. Could arbitrators overseas simply decide to ignore American law in deciding the antitrust claim? Cross said that it was not likely, from what he understood, and that in any event arbitrators had handled cases as complex, if not more than, antitrust claims and so were not incapable of the instant case. He called the American Safety doctrine \\"a usurpation of power.\\" Soler Rodriguez-Ramon laid out the facts of the case at length in order to bolster his case that the arbitration clause should not be applied to matters the parties had not expressly agreed to arbitrate such as the statutory claims. \\"You have a fairly hard row to hoe here in getting us to change that,\\" one justice told him, acknowledging the lower-court rulings. Rodriguez-Ramon cited the efficiency and expediency offered by arbitration as factors the Court had held in its favor, and contrasted that with his now-bankrupt client, who would have to take all his witnesses and evidence to Japan for a case to be heard in that country's language. Asked why, given the clear advantage that seemed to offer, Mitsubishi would have written into what Rodriguez-Ramon contended was an adhesion contract such a narrow arbitration clause, the lawyer insisted that \\"Mitsubishi only considered the possibility of arbitrating commercial contractual controversy.\\" Why else, he suggested, would the language of the arbitration clause have specifically mentioned the sections of the contract to which it applied? And even if it had been intended so broadly, he reminded the Court that it had held in many other cases that some statutory claims could not be arbitrated. Further, both the FAA and the Convention allowed for this distinction. \\"Finally, in terms of antitrust litigation, what are we talking about?\\" Rodriguez-Ramon concluded. \\"An antitrust litigant in this country has a right to litigate before a court and before his peers. He is entitled to have a trial by jury. He is entitled to be heard by 12 of his peers concerning whether the defendant has committed ... a restraint of trade.\\" Lastly, Rodriguez-Ramon distinguished Soler's case from Scherk by two factors. First, the contract had not been negotiated as it had been in the older case; and second, the contract in Scherk called for performance overseas while Soler had to make its performance in a U.S. territory. Nor did he find Southland Corp. v. Keating, in which the Court held the FAA applied to contracts executed under state law,Southland Corp. v. Keating, . applicable, since in that case the Court had considered a law unique to California whereas here it was dealing with a law parallel to a federal statute that almost every state had enacted. \\"The consequence of a contrary holding by this honorable Court, I respectfully submit, are ominous,\\" said Rodriguez-Ramon. If it allowed arbitration such as the one his client was preparing for, almost any large international corporation would be able to word contracts so as to skirt American law. [A]ll these people will have to go to arbitrate outside of the continental United States, in foreign arbitration areas different from the United States, possibly under different languages, under different juridical criteria for the adjudication of controversies.\\" United States \\"The Court of Appeals properly accommodated the three interests that are at issue in this case,\\" Ganzfried told the justices. \\"[T]hose interests are, one, the primacy of antitrust law in preserving our economic system of free competition; two, the general encouragement of arbitration as a means of resolving private disputes; and three, our commitment to an international convention that requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate with very limited exceptions.\\" An agreement to arbitrate antitrust claims would not be enforceable, he maintained, even if it specified members of Congress or senior federal judges as arbitrators. \\"The fact is that they are operating in a system in which there is no substantive appellate review.\\" Even if that was part of what the parties bargained for, he maintained, the underlying public policy was too important. Private actions had always been intended under antitrust law, Ganzfried reminded the justices. He raised the possibility that a manufacturer could, through agreements with all its distributors, create \\"a nice, tidy buffer from the American antitrust laws\\", since the indirect purchasers would likewise lack standing to sue under the Illinois Brick doctrine. When it was pointed out that the FAA was passed after the antitrust laws, \\"the history of the enforcement of the antitrust laws strongly indicates that it was not even considered a remote possibility worth discussing that antitrust actions would be subject to arbitration.\\" There was no record anyone had been able to find of private parties arbitrating one. Cross, allowed five minutes for rebuttal, addressed Ganzfried's closing observation that under JCAA rules, testimony was not taken under oath. \\"[I]t may be that the oath taking process has something to do with the culture of Japan where taking an oath doesn't have quite the significance that it does here.\\" He admitted that the arbitrators still had to consider the credibility of the witnesses, but called Ganzfried's claim \\"a straw man.\\" ==Decision== The Court announced its decision in July, near the end of term. Harry Blackmun wrote for a five- justice majority that affirmed the First Circuit's holding that the statutory claims were arbitrable and reversed it by holding the antitrust claims arbitrable as well. John Paul Stevens' lengthy dissent argued primarily that the arbitration clause was inapplicable to the dispute, and the precedent against arbitrating antitrust claims was far stronger than the majority represented it to be. Justice Lewis Powell took no part in the case. Majority opinion alt=An older man with glasses wearing black with a shelf full of brown, red and black books behind him \\"[W]e find no warrant in the Arbitration Act for implying in every contract within its ken a presumption against arbitration of statutory claims,\\" Blackmun wrote in response to Soler's claims under the Car Dealers' Day In Court Act. The Court's own recent decisions on arbitration had been very supportive, and he saw no reason to hold, in their light, that they did not apply only to contractual disputes. While conversely not every statutory claim was suitable for arbitration, \\"the Act itself provides no basis for disfavoring agreements to arbitrate statutory claims by skewing the otherwise hospitable inquiry into arbitrability ... Soler's concern for statutorily protected classes provides no reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read.\\"Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., , at 625‚Äì628. The antitrust claims led to a lengthier discussion. First, Blackmun noted that in both Scherk and The Bremen, the Court had found the international nature of the dispute was a special circumstance justifying arbitration. \\"We must weigh the concerns of American Safety against a strong belief in the efficacy of arbitral procedures for the resolution of international commercial disputes and an equal commitment to the enforcement of freely negotiated choice-of- forum clauses.\\"Mitsubishi Motors II, at 628‚Äì631. \\"[W]e confess to some skepticism of certain aspects of the American Safety doctrine,\\" Blackmun wrote. Where the First Circuit had expressed concern that the underlying contract may have been adhesive, he said that suspicion was too narrow a ground to defeat the arbitration clause, especially since the Court's Prima Paint separability doctrine had held that the validity of the arbitration clause itself could be attacked in court.Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., He also doubted that even some of the appellate courts which had followed American Safety truly believed that antitrust cases were too complex for arbitrators to handle. Nor did he believe that arbitators might inherently be too conflicted.Mitsubishi Motors II, at 632‚Äì634. The last of the First Circuit's justifications Blackmun considered was the public policy doctrine argument. While he agreed that this was demonstrated by the treble damages provision, \\"[its] importance ... does not compel the conclusion that it may not be sought outside an American court.\\" In fact, the Court itself had found when inquiring into the legislative history of the Sherman Act in Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. that the treble damages were primarily intended to help individual litigants and not to serve a greater public policy.Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., , at 485‚Äì86.Mitsubishi Motors II, at 634‚Äì640. \\"To be sure,\\" Blackmun qualified, The interests of American law and the American courts would, he noted, be served on the enforcement of the claim, which under the New York Convention individual countries could refuse to do if the verdict or award were contrary to their public policy. Blackmun concluded by noting the increase in international trade, and with it arbitration to resolve disputes. \\"The controversies that international arbitral institutions are called upon to resolve have increased in diversity as well as in complexity,\\" he observed. \\"Yet the potential of these tribunals for efficient disposition of legal disagreements arising from commercial relations has not yet been tested.\\" He exhorted American courts \\"to subordinate domestic notions of arbitrability to the international policy favoring commercial arbitration\\" when faced with similar cases in the future. Dissent Stevens' lengthy dissent was joined by William Brennan and, with the exception of Part II, where Stevens argued against allowing statutory claims to be arbitrated, Thurgood Marshall. \\"I am convinced,\\" Stevens began, \\"that the Court of Appeals' construction of the arbitration clause is erroneous, and because I strongly disagree with this Court's interpretation of the relevant federal statutes, I respectfully dissent.\\"Mitsubishi Motors II, at 641, Stevens, J., dissenting. alt=An older man with white hair wearing a black robe and a bow tie First, Stevens observed that the arbitration clause was in the sales procedure agreement, to which Chrysler as well Soler and Mitsubishi were party. It only applied to two-party disputes, yet Soler's antitrust claim was against both manufacturers. \\"Only by stretching the language of the arbitration clause far beyond its ordinary meaning could one possibly conclude that it encompasses this three-party dispute.\\" Second, it only covered five of the 15 articles of the contract, and none of those five addressed areas which had given rise to Soler's antitrust claim. \\"The federal policy favoring arbitration cannot sustain the weight that the Court assigns to it. A clause requiring arbitration of all claims 'relating to' a contract surely could not encompass a claim that the arbitration clause was itself part of a contract in restraint of trade.\\"Mitsubishi Motors II, at 643‚Äì645. This, Stevens noted, was the first time the Court had held a statutory claim, as opposed to a merely contractual one, to be arbitrable. However, in its longer line of cases on labor arbitration, the Court had consistently held that statutory claims could not be arbitrated. \\"It is reasonable to assume that most lawyers and executives would not expect the language in the standard arbitration clause to cover federal statutory claims.\\"Mitsubishi Motors II, at 647‚Äì650. He reiterated past holdings in antitrust cases where the Court had indeed recognized the public-policy role of private actions, particularly by noting the uniqueness of the treble-damages provision when first passed. \\"There are, in addition, several unusual features of the antitrust enforcement scheme that unequivocally require rejection of any thought that Congress would tolerate private arbitration of antitrust claims in lieu of the statutory remedies that it fashioned\\": Only federal courts had jurisdiction, Congress had required that depositions in Sherman Act cases be made public, and the Clayton Act allowed that a judgement or decree in a Sherman Act case was prima facie proof of wrongdoing for actions under it. \\"[I]t is not surprising that all of the federal courts that have considered the question have uniformly and unhesitatingly concluded that agreements to arbitrate federal antitrust issues are not enforceable,\\" he wrote, citing American Safety once again. In his final section, Stevens responded to the majority's arguments about the international nature of the dispute making arbitration more important. The Convention had fully anticipated that signatory nations had or were likely to declare, through their own laws, that certain disputes were not arbitrable. \\"[T]he international obligations of the United States permit us to honor Congress' commitment to the exclusive resolution of antitrust disputes in the federal courts,\\" much as how foreign courts had held that certain categories of disputes, including analogous competition-law disputes, in their countries could not be arbitrated. The State Department's brief had promised that other signatory countries to the Convention would not be upset if antitrust claims were exempted due to those policies, he reminded the majority.Mitsubishi Motors II, at 658‚Äì661. Since the majority had tacitly accepted this by not grounding its argument to the contrary in any outside support, Stevens noted, it \\"seeks refuge in an obtuse application of [Scherk].\\" Soler's case was, for him, distinguished from Scherk by the same issue that Court had distinguished it from Wilko: the claim involved purely American law. \\"I consider it perfectly clear that the rules of American antitrust law must govern the claim of an American automobile dealer that he has been injured by an international conspiracy to restrain trade in the American automobile market ... the same antitrust questions would be presented if Mitsubishi were owned by two American companies instead of by one American and one Japanese partner. When Mitsubishi enters the American market and plans to engage in business in that market over a period of years, it must recognize its obligation to comply with American law and to be subject to the remedial provisions of American statutes.\\" And that, to Stevens, meant the Car Dealers' Day in Court Act as much as the Sherman Act.Mitsubishi Motors II, at 661‚Äì665. \\"The Court's repeated incantation of the high ideals of 'international arbitration' creates the impression that this case involves the fate of an institution designed to implement a formula for world peace,\\" Stevens concluded. ==Subsequent proceedings== On remand almost two months later, the First Circuit affirmed the entire original district court decision, allowing for arbitration to resume. In September Mitsubishi moved in Bankruptcy Court to vacate the automatic stay that had been in place pending the outcome of the case at the Supreme Court. Soler began an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court, reiterating its original complaints against the manufacturer. A separate answer to Mitsubishi's motion was filed in October, in which Soler argued that its desperate financial straits prevented it from being \\"legally or equitably compelled\\" to return to Tokyo. Mitsubishi responded by filing in district court to withdraw reference of both actions from bankruptcy court to its own jurisdiction. Soler consented to a stay of those proceedings while the district court considered the motion. In April 1986 that action was removed to district court. After its motion to reconsider was denied, Soler again appealed to the First Circuit. Coffin and Bownes were again on the panel, this time joined by Juan R. Torruella. They affirmed the district court unanimously, citing res judicata. \\"Here, Soler failed to raise the issue of its inability to finance the arbitration in Japan before any of the courts involved in the series of proceedings initiated by Mitsubishi's attempt to compel arbitration,\\" Coffin wrote. It had declared bankruptcy before the Supreme Court's certiorari grant, so at all times since then it was aware of the issue. The first question, then, was whether it had had an adequate opportunity to do so, regardless of whether it actually had. Soler claimed that it could not have done so at the Supreme Court since the record was already fixed. Therefore, it argued, neither there nor on remand could it have done so. \\"We are unpersuaded by Soler's argument,\\" Coffin responded, \\"and view this latest round of litigation as yet another episode in Soler's long series of misguided efforts to avoid arbitration with Mitsubishi at all costs.\\" The dealership had cited no legal basis for why it could not have added the bankruptcy to its record before the Supreme Court, and Coffin could not find anywhere in the record where it had brought it up. As for remand, while it was not uncommon for parties to raise new issues there, \\"but Soler was content to remain silent and await a second bite at the apple before the bankruptcy court. Soler has offered no compelling argument to justify its silence at this stage of the proceedings, nor can we even conceive of one.\\" He described its behavior as a \\"'sandbagging' strategy of the type that the doctrine of res judicata is designed to prevent ... This we cannot tolerate.\\" The second question Coffin described as \\"more troublesome\\": did the district court abuse its discretion by lifting the stay without a hearing? The bankruptcy code required one, but the district court had done so simply after reviewing the record. While normally the appeals court would have reversed the district court and ordered a hearing, \\"given the unique circumstances and history of this case, we cannot fault the district court for determining that the stay should be lifted expeditiously in accordance with the prior orders of the Supreme Court and this court.\\" \\"Soler's only colorable argument for maintaining the stay was its inability to finance the Japanese arbitration, precisely the issue it was precluded from raising at such a late date,\\" Coffin wrote. Since it did not, the district court did not need to hold a hearing; there was no other argument. ==Subsequent jurisprudence== Two years later, in Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, the Court built on Mitsubishi Motors, and again overruled a long-standing Second Circuit precedent, holding that statutory claims of securities fraud under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were also arbitrable.Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, . Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority that Mitsubishi Motors and its predecessor cases had helped dispel former judicial mistrust of arbitration;McMahon, 482 U.S. 226, 232, O'Connor, J. similarly, it dismissed public-policy arguments in support of the nonarbitrability of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) actions.McMahon, at 239‚Äì242. Blackmun, dissenting this time, claimed that the majority was \\"in direct contradiction\\" of his opinion in Mitsubishi Motors, since it had rested on the lack of public policy intentions in the statute at issue rather than doubts about the suitability of the arbitral process.McMahon, at 251, Blackmun, J., dissenting. Two more years later, in 1989, the Court extended the FAA's reach over statutory disputes even further when it overruled Wilko v. Swan completely in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., adding claims under the Securities Act of 1933 (effectively, all remaining possible securities fraud claims) to those that could be arbitrated.Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., By the late 1990s McMahon and Rodriguez were being described as the other two components of the \\"Mitsubishi Trilogy\\", due to their combined role in opening the doors to arbitration of other statutory claims,Lewton, Robert J.;\\"Are Mandatory, Binding Arbitration Requirements A Viable Solution For Employers Seeking to Avoid Statutory Employment Discrimination Claims?\\"; 59 Alb. L. Rev. 991, 1006 (1995-1996). as the Court did with Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claims in 1991's Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp..Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., . The Second Circuit was the first lower court to apply Mitsubishi in 1986 when it heard Genesco, Inc. v. T. Kakiuchi & Co., Ltd., a case with many similarities. Genesco, a clothing manufacturer, had brought antitrust claims against both its American supplier of fabric and its eponymous Japanese parent company, alleging they and one of Genesco's employees conspired to destroy it by consistently selling it overpriced and/or low-quality material in violation of RICO and the Robinson‚ÄìPatman Act, along with tortious interference and fraud claims. The two defendants sought arbitration before the JCAA per their contracts. After the district court stayed the fraud and RICO claims against the American subsidiary, both it and the parent company appealed.Genesco, Inc. v. T. Kakiuchi & Co., Ltd., 815 F. 2d 840 (2nd Cir., 1987). Richard J. Cardamone wrote for a panel that followed Mitsbushis analysis: first holding the arbitration clause valid, then inquiring into whether the claims came under its scope. Since, as the Mitsubishi majority had found, the alleged bad acts arose from the activities covered by the contract, all save the RICO and tortious interference claims were arbitrable. It told the district court to stay even the RICO claims, however, pending the outcome of McMahon at the Supreme Court (which ruled them arbitrable). Abandonment of American Safety Since Mitsubishi had explicitly avoided the question of whether purely domestic antitrust claims were arbitrable, lower courts mostly proceeded with caution. A 1987 Southern District of New York case noted that \\"the foundations of the American Safety doctrine have been significantly eroded\\" and speculated that the Supreme Court would likely overrule that case if the question came before them.Gemco Latinoamerica, Inc. v. Seiko Time Corp., 671 F. Supp. 972, 979 (S.D.N.Y., 1987). Four years later, after Rodriguez, William C. Conner, another judge from that district, held that along with the later cases, Mitsubishi should be read to make domestic antitrust claims arbitrable as well;Hough v. Merrill Lynch, 757 F. Supp. 283 (S.D.N.Y., 1991). the Second Circuit affirmed without an opinion.946 F. 2d 883 (2nd Cir., 1991). An explicit overruling of American Safety at the appellate level came from the Ninth Circuit. A Title VII employment-discrimination case it heard in 1994, Nghiem v. NEC Electronic, Inc., included an antitrust claim among its appeals of an arbitration award. Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote that while the circuit had followed American Safety since 1984,Lake Communications, Inc. v. ICC Corp., 738 F. 2d 1473 (9th Cir., 1984). the post- Mitsubishi cases, including Gilmer, \\"the Supreme Court has indeed undermined the reasoning behind [that case]\\". He noted the Court's later reliance on Mitsubishi for ordering other statutory claims arbitrated and reiterated Blackmun's criticism of the American Safety doctrine. \\"Given the Court's meticulous step-by-step disembowelment of the American Safety doctrine, this circuit will no longer follow [it]. We hold that Mitsubishi effectively overruled American Safety and its progeny ...\\"Nghiem v. NEC Electronic Inc., 25 F. 3d 1437 (9th Cir., 1994). The Eleventh Circuit followed suit in 1996, overruling its own precedent to comply with Mitsubishi.Kotam Electronics, Inc. v. JBL Consumer Products, Inc., 93 F. 3d 724 (11th Cir., 1996). Prospective-waiver dictum in footnote 19 In his 19th footnote, Blackmun had admitted there was in the case a possible reason not to compel arbitration, raised in the federal government's brief: that, since the contract was governed by Swiss law, the arbitration panel could therefore decide to disregard the Sherman Act entirely and consider Soler's claims under that body of law. On the other side, the International Chamber of Commerce had conceded in its amicus brief that that could occur as well, though it considered the possibility unlikely. Blackmun allowed that this was a valid concern but countered that Mitsubishi had already stipulated at oral argument that American law would control the antitrust claims, mooting it in the instant case.Mitsubishi Motors II, 473 U.S. 614, 637n19. Should that issue actually arise in a future case, Blackmun observed, the proper time to raise it was not prior to the arbitration but afterwards, when the court would be asked to enforce the award. He added that \\"... in the event the choice-of- forum and choice-of-law clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party's right to pursue statutory remedies for antitrust violations, we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.\\" Several subsequent cases, at the Supreme Court and in the Eleventh Circuit, all in admiralty law, have considered and applied that dictum. In 1995, the Supreme Court decided Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. v. M/V Sky Reefer. Fruit shipped from Morocco to New England via a Panamanian-flagged boat was found by the buyer to have been improperly stored and damaged; the buyer's insurer pursued an in rem action against the ship to recover. The bill of lading contained a clause calling for disputes to be arbitrated in Japan by the Tokyo Maritime Arbitration Commission (TOMAC); the buyer had cited the non-waiver provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) in opposition. Both the district court and the First CircuitVimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 29 F. 3d 727 (1st Cir., 1994). compelled arbitration.Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. v. M/V Sky Reefer (Vimar Seguros II), , at 531‚Äì532, Kennedy, J. The petitioner argued that the Japanese Hague Rules, which would govern the arbitration, allowed them to recover less than COGSA would since it released the shipper from liability for the action of hired stevedores. In support they relied on the footnote 19 dictum. Anthony Kennedy, writing for a 7‚Äì1 majority, extended it slightly by observing that it was not clear at that point whether TOMAC actually would apply the Hague Rules instead of COGSA, and if it did and Vimar was unsatisfied it could then seek a remedy from American courts during enforcement.Vimar Seguros II, at 539‚Äì541. Only once since then has the Court mentioned it. In 2009's 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, it held that a collective bargaining agreement's arbitration clause required members of the signatory union to arbitrate ADEA claims. Clarence Thomas's majority opinion briefly noted in passing that under that dictum, \\"a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be upheld.\\"14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, . While the Ninth Circuit has said that it does not consider footnote 19's prospective-waiver dictum binding,Simula v. Autoliv, 175 F. 3d 716, 723 (9th Cir., 1999). and indeed seems to resent litigants raising it,Richards v. Lloyd's of London, 135 F. 3d 1289, 1295 (9th Cir., 1998). \\"Without question this case would be easier to decide if this footnote in Mitsubishi had not been inserted.\\" the Eleventh Circuit has explored it at some length in two recent cases involving disputes between cruise-ship workers and the lines that employ them. In Thomas v. Carnival Corp., it held that an arbitration clause requiring a Philippine national to arbitrate a negligence claim there under Panamanian law, which had no equivalent of the Seamen's Wage Act on which the claim was based, worked in tandem to deny Thomas an opportunity for review by an American court, and was therefore null and void. \\"... [T]he possibility of such a result would counsel against being deferential in this circumstance,\\" its per curiam opinion said, \\"as it is exactly the sort that the Supreme Court has described.\\"Thomas v. Carnival Corp., 573 F. 3d 1113, 1120‚Äì1124 (11th Cir., 2009). alt=A white ship several stories, seen from off the starboard side of the bow, with \\"Norwegian Dawn\\" painted on the side Two years later, in 2011, the circuit divided sharply over a similar case, Lindo v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd., where footnote 19 was \\"hotly disputed.\\"Lindo v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd., 652 F. 3d 1257, 1266. A Nicaraguan who suffered a back injury on the Norwegian Dawn challenged the Bahamanian-law arbitration mandated by his contract on the same grounds as Thomas. Frank M. Hull wrote a lengthy opinion that reviewed in detail all relevant case law up to ThomasLindo, 1260‚Äì1275. and heavily criticized it. Thomas, Hull wrote, ignored Vimar and had ignored circuit precedent that under the Convention, arbitration clauses could only be voided prior to the process for the same general grounds as contracts anywhere. It also failed to properly apply the Convention, rendering its public-policy defense in error. Footnote 19, she wrote, was \\"indisputably dicta\\".Lindo, 1277‚Äì1280. Rosemary Barkett, a member of the original Thomas panel, dissented. \\"I do not believe that Lindo must needlessly wait until after arbitration to raise his public policy argument,\\" she wrote. The majority had read the Convention too narrowly, and footnote 19, far from being dicta, \\"was critical to the Court's reasoning and the outcome of the case. Merely because the Court did not find a prospective waiver there does not make that language‚Äîforming part of the Court's core reasoning‚Äîdicta.\\" If it were, she observed, the Court would have said so in Vimar and Pyett.Lindo, at 1288, 1294. She accused her colleagues of \\"effectively transform[ing] the enforcement of international arbitration agreements into the top U.S. public policy\\" by treating footnote 19 as dicta. \\"[T]here is nothing to suggest that the political branches ever intended such a result ... I believe the Supreme Court meant what it said in Mitsubishi.\\"Lindo, 1297. ==Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act== In the wake of the decision, more automobile manufacturers began putting arbitration clauses in their contracts, and courts began enforcing them. Dealers opposed them, sometimes in court, since the ADDCA had been passed to give them a judicial forum for those disputes, as its popular name implied. Some took refuge in state laws regulating motor vehicle franchising that explicitly barred the enforcement of arbitration clauses. But in 1990 the Fourth Circuit struck that provision of Virginia's Motor Vehicle Dealer Licensing Act down as incompatible with the FAA under Southland Corp. v. Keating and the Supreme Court's other arbitration jurisprudence.Saturn Distribution Corp. v. Williams, 905 F.2d 719 (4th Cir., 1990). Dealers had lobbied Congress and the state legislatures for many years for ADDCA and its corresponding state statutes, through the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) and other groups, and saw the court holdings as an assault on the protections they had gained. They began lobbying Congress for an exception to the FAA that would make arbitration of such disputes voluntary.Carrington, Paul D.; Self-Deregulation, The \\"National Policy\\" of the Supreme Court; 3 N.L.J. 259, 271; Winter 2002/2003. Retrieved April 15, 2012. Early in the 21st century, the 107th Congress considered the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act (MVFCAFA), which would add new language to the ADDCA stating that \\"Whenever a motor vehicle franchise contract provides for the use of arbitration to resolve a controversy arising out of or relating to the contract, arbitration may be used to settle such controversy only if after such controversy arises both parties consent in writing to use arbitration to settle such controversy\\" and requiring \\"a written explanation of the factual and legal basis for the award.\\" Referring to Mitsubishi, \\"[t]he Supreme Court was not persuaded by the argument that only contractual disputes, not statutory rights, should be determined through mandatory binding arbitration even when the claims presented are complex and carry as many public policy implications as a claim under the Sherman Act,\\" the Senate Judiciary Committee said in its report on the bill. After recounting some unsatisfactory dealer experiences with arbitration, it concluded that \\"[i]t is clear that dealers are being required to forfeit important rights and remedies afforded by [s]tate law as a condition of obtaining or renewing their motor vehicle franchise contracts\\" and that due to Mitsubishi and the other similar cases, it was necessary for Congress to create an exception to the FAA. A minority report criticized the MVFCAFA as \\"revers[ing] a long-standing congressional policy favoring arbitration in a manner that undermines the sanctity of contract.\\" According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce only a small fraction of dealers had franchise agreements with predispute arbitration clauses that would have been negated; some consumer groups like Public Citizen which had been lobbying against mandatory predispute arbitration clauses in consumer adhesion contracts actually opposed the MVFCAFA on the grounds that such clauses were far more common in contracts between dealers and consumers. It was passed as a rider on that year's Justice Department appropriations bill,21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, P.L. 107-273, Nov. 2, 2002, sec. 11028, 116 Stat. 1758 (). and went into effect later in the year after President George W. Bush signed it into law. \\"The three-paragraph Act is a landmark,\\" Franchise Law Journal commented. \\"For the first time, a special-interest exemption to the FAA has become law.\\" In 2010, two associates at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough in South Carolina reviewed how the MVFCAFA had been interpreted by the courts in the intervening eight years. \\"At first blush, [it] appeared to be a big win for automobile dealers,\\" they observed. But courts had construed it narrowly, as applicable only to the actual franchise agreement and not any separate dealer- manufacturer agreements even where the disputed conduct touched on issues referenced in the franchise agreement. Most cases had thus turned on whether contract law in the state of the dispute allowed the separate agreement to be treated as incorporated by reference into the franchise agreement. Courts had also rejected in most cases a reading of the law as intended to protect dealers, holding that it may not be used by them to compel arbitration with the manufacturer when it would prefer to litigate. \\"Despite the Congressional attempt to tip the balance of power between dealers and manufacturers in favor of dealers, courts have allowed manufacturers to retain their ability to compel arbitration in many of the disputes that arise between dealers and manufacturers,\\" they concluded. ==Analysis and commentary== Commentators have ascribed much importance to Mitsubishi Motors, calling it \\"landmark\\"Donovan, Donald F. and Greenawalt, Alexander K.A.; \\"Mitsubishi After Twenty Years: Mandatory Rules before Courts and International Arbitrators\\"; from Pervasive Problems in International Arbitration 11, 2006; Loukas Mistelis & Julian D.M.

Retrieved April 16, 2012. It has been discussed in both the context of domestic and international arbitration. In the former area, critics of the increased role of arbitration in dispute resolution have objected to it strongly. Duke law professor Paul Carrington has complained that by denying the public policy behind the Sherman Act, the Court effectively repealed the treble-damages provision since there is no corresponding provision in Japanese competition law. Likewise, later decisions holding that the provisions of both the FAA and ADDCA can be satisfied by arbitration allow an older statute to effectively repeal a later one. \\"The Court has not explained the jurisprudence reflected in this intellectual gymnastic.\\" Ramona Lampley, a Wake Forest visiting professor who has since returned to private practice, calls the Mitsubishi trilogy the \\"vindication of statutory rights\\" trilogy. \\"Mitsubishi laid the cornerstone for the Court's sheltered fostering of arbitration agreements,\\" she writes. However, \\"in a case intended to cast arbitration, even of remedial statutes, on equal or more favorable footing as the judicial forum, the Court crafted language that would soon give rise to a method for invalidating arbitration agreements\\" when litigants in later class actions were able to invalidate arbitration clauses by successfully questioning whether the process would vindicate their statutory rights.Lampley, Ramona L.; '\\"Is Arbitation Under Attack? Exploring the Recent Judicial Skepticism of the Class Action Waiver And Innovative Solutions to the Unsettled Legal Landscape\\", 40 J.L.P.P. 477, 493 (2009); retrieved April 16, 2012. Within the international-arbitration context, commentators have applauded the Court's support for the process but criticized its reasoning. Laurence Smith, a law student at Penn, criticizes the decision as an \\"unprincipled\\" route to the proper result Instead of the balancing test the Court used, he recommends a two-prong test based on the extraterritorial acceptance of U.S. antitrust law and the provisions of the Convention. Another writer gladdened to see more support for international arbitration, Thomas Carbonneau, nevertheless found much to agree with in Stevens' dissent. \\"[T]here is much that is unfortunate about [the majority]'s reasoning and methodology,\\" he wrote. \\"[It] is misguided; it advances a distorted and disproportionate view of arbitration.\\" Regulatory claims, he said, were by design best left to national courts, criticizing the Court's \\"anational\\" approach. He also found footnote 19 to be a \\"careless afterthought ... it is unlikely that such an award would ever come to the United States for enforcement.\\" Other commentators have found that it either contradicts itself or the rest of the opinion, and/or offers no guidance to courts faced with such a case.Donovan and Greenawalt, 24‚Äì25.Guzman, Andrew; \\"Arbitrator Liability: Reconciling Arbitration and Mandatory Rules\\"; 49 Duke L.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster and Morecambe, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. ==History== The oldest parts of the church date from the 12th century. In 1771 it was partly rebuilt, resulting in a chancel wider than the nave. A long north transept was added in 1830, the architect being William Coulthard. A restoration of the church was carried out by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley in 1902, when they removed plaster from the walls, added new floors, steps and seat, repaired the roof, and inserted stone mullions in three windows. This work cost ¬£650 (). During the course of the restoration the architects discovered the foundation of an earlier canted apse at the east end. ==Architecture== St Helen's is constructed in sandstone rubble, with a stone slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave, a wider chancel, and a north transept containing the organ and a vestry. At the west end is a bellcote, beneath which is a plain two-light window. There are similar windows on the north and south sides of the nave and on the south wall of the chancel. On the south side of the church is a Norman doorway, with badly eroded carving. Above the doorway is a plaque, also eroded. The east window has a semicircular head with a keystone. The windows in the transept are tall, with mullions and round heads. Inside the church there are galleries at the west end, and in the transept. On the east wall are boards painted with the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer.

Princess Basmah is known for introducing the Fourth Way Law. Princess Basmah is the youngest child of her father King Saud. Her mother Princess Jamila immigrated to Saudi Arabia from the Syrian port city of Latakia. She married King Abdulaziz' son and successor King Saud, with whom she had seven children. In March 2019, Basmah bint Saud was arrested by eight armed men when she tried to leave Saudi-Arabia for medical attention in Switzerland, and has since been missing from public view. It has been reported that she is being held in the Al-Hayer prison.

Her mother was a Syrian-born woman, Jamila Merhi, who was chosen for her future husband when she visited Mecca on the hajj. Basmah was born during the final months of her father's reign, the same month he was overthrown as a real ruler in a palace coup. She saw him only twice when she was five, the year of his death. Her mother took her to the Middle East's then-most cosmopolitan city, the Lebanese capital of Beirut. When Lebanon's civil war broke out in 1975, the family fled for Britain. ==Education== In Beirut, Basmah bint Saud attended a French school. In Britain, she attended a Hertfordshire girls' school and a College in London, before spending two years studying in Switzerland. Basmah studied medicine, psychology and English literature at Beirut Arab University. In 1979, she graduated from high school at the Leaders College in America. Basmah travelled between several European capital cities and the US, where she studied at various universities, before moving with her mother to Syria in 1983. These universities included Richmond in the UK the American University in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she studied the social sciences. In 1984, she received BSc (Hons) Degree in Sociology from the National American University, then in 1986, went on to achieve MSc Degree in Social Economics and Political Science. ==Personal life== In 1988 Princess Basmah was married to Shuja bin Nami bin Shahin Al Sharif,The mysterious disappearance of Princess Basmah of Saudi Arabia a member of the Al Sharif family. They divorced in 2007. She is mother of five children. Her children, three daughters and two sons, are Saud, Sara, Samahir, Suhoud and Ahmad. ==Business== After Basmah bint Saud divorced her Saudi husband, she founded a chain of restaurants in Saudi Arabia and she is planning to expand these into Britain. In 2008, she also founded a media firm, Media Ecco, in addition to catering firms, which she is also planning to expand. Views Basmah bint Saud is a mild advocate of reform. She has been an active participant of different social institutions and human rights organizations. She began to express her views on Arab and international media, writing articles on the hard life conditions of Saudis, particularly of women. However, her criticisms do not directly address the royal family but the Saudi governors and other middle-level administrators. Writing for Al Madina newspaper in April 2010, Basmah bint Saud told that she could not find any Qur'anic or Islamic historical basis for a state institution to promote virtue and prevent vice, and she further argued that the arrests and beatings by religious policemen lead to an incorrect impression about Islam. She specifically supports reform in Saudi Islamic laws regarding bans on mixed gatherings of men and women, and to make optional for Muslim women to cover modestly or not. Her journalism and blogging has drawn criticism, and she told The Independent that Saudi officials had begun censoring her articles. On the other hand, she insisted that her move from Jeddah to Acton was not due to pressure from the Saudi state. Basmah bint Saud has questioned the misuse of the Islamic fiqh in Saudi society, arguing that the religious establishment needs to be reformed in order that it plays a constructive role in modernising society and improving the situation of women in the kingdom. In April 2012, Basmah told BBC that there are many changes she would like to see in Saudi Arabia but that is not the time for women to be allowed to drive, a right Saudi women were given as part of the reforms by King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Basmah called for changes concerning constitution, divorce laws, overhaul of the educational system, complete reform of social services and changes in the role of the mahram (the male guardian, usually a relative, that all Saudi women are required to have). Upon the paralysing of a Saudi national as a punishment by the Kingdom, Princess Basmah criticised it, stating that it cannot be acceptable on humanitarian grounds. ==The Fourth Way Law== Through the research centre, GURA, based in London, the Fourth Way Law was registered and documented by the European Union in 2014. Princess Basmah received a prize in recognition for internationally monitoring human rights, geopolitical changes, international developments, establishing training centres in various fields related to the culture of the Fourth Way Law on a global scale, such as security, economic and administrative. It has been noted that many countries, such as America and Britain, have been taking recommendations from the Fourth Way Law when making decisions on intellectual, environmental and economic security which other specialist international research centres had not discussed. One of these recommendations was the decision of the American President Obama in 2014 to implement a law to monitor social network sites and develop specialised laws for it. Many sections from the Fourth Way Law specialising in human rights have also been adopted in Britain after she gave a famous lecture at the University of Cambridge in 2012. In July 2015, the British government took up all the recommendations offered by Princess Basmah in the Fourth Way Law during her residence in Britain (2011‚Äì2014). ==ReferencesCategory:20th-century businesswomen Category:21st-century businesswomen Basmah Basmah Category:1964 births Category:Beirut Arab University alumni Basmah Category:Living people Category:Saudi Arabian expatriates in the United Kingdom Basma Category:Saudi Arabian businesspeople Category:Saudi Arabian women in business ","title":"Basmah bint Saud Al Saud"},{"id":"35334920","text":"Jingo was an unincorporated community located in Roane County, West Virginia.

The senatorial districts (except those in New York City) were made up of entire counties. 128 Assemblymen were elected in single- seat districts to a one-year term, the whole Assembly being renewed annually. The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all in the same county. The City and County of New York was divided into four senatorial districts, and 16 Assembly districts. On September 27, the Legislative passed \\"An Act to provide for the election of a Lieutenant Governor\\", to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Addison Gardiner. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. The Democratic Party was split into two factions: the \\"Barnburners\\" and the \\"Hunkers.\\" The radical abolitionists appeared as the Liberty Party. The Anti-Rent Party nominated some candidates, but mostly cross-endorsed Whigs or Democrats, according to their opinion on the rent issue. The Native American Party (later better known as \\"Know Nothings\\") also ran. ==Elections== The New York state election, 1847 was held on November 3.

An opole was characterised by close geographical ties between a group of settlements and common legal responsibilities collectively affecting all of them. The institution of the opole predates the Kingdom of Poland, and began disappearing around the 13th to 15th centuries. It was the lowest unit of administration in the medieval Polish kingdom, subordinate to the castellany. A particular opole would be named after its largest, capital settlement. Most notably, the term survived as a name of a major city in Poland, Opole, and is also associated with the Opolans tribe. ==History and function== The organization of the opole predates the first Polish state, the Kingdom of Poland. Opoles were characteristic of the Slavic tribes and had their genesis in ties between neighbourhoods. In the loose organizational structure of those times, the opole stood as an intermediate stage between an extended family and the wider tribe; Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski refers to opoles as the \\"constituent units of the tribe\\". At first, depending on the density of inhabitants, an opole could cover an area of between few dozen to a few hundred square kilometers, with an average area of about . Opoles would comprise both larger settlements and individual manors. Opoles had several forms of collective responsibility; for example the members of the opole were required to pay certain taxes as a unit and perform services for the state (such as providing cattle or aiding in searches for fugitives). In some documents, the term opole would be used to refer to those obligations. The close geographical ties between a group of settlements, and common legal responsibilities collectively affecting all of them, can be seen as the primary defining characteristics of an opole. However, Bardach notes that practically nothing is known about the internal organization of the opole. They were subordinate to the local castellany. Opoles began disappearing around the 13th to 15th centuries. According to Bardach, the causes included a proliferation of settlements applying Magdeburg rights (German legal codes), and the advent of economic and judicial immunities among the feudal lords (nobility and clergy), which removed many settlements from the state's jurisdiction. Those processes accelerated around the time of the fragmentation of Poland (12th to 14th centuries). Opoles disappeared earliest in Silesia and Lesser Poland, and survived the longest in the Masovia region of east-central Poland. ==References== Category:Subdivisions of Poland ","title":"Opole (administrative)"},{"id":"35334967","text":"ƒêorƒëe Stefanoviƒá (also transliterated Djordje; 8 November 1921 - 30 July 2012)Athletics International 2012, No. 28.

After attending a day school in the town, he went to Eton College, where he remained three years. On leaving Eton he read with a tutor at Bury, Lancashire, and in January 1783 he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge., graduating eighth wrangler in 1787. In the same year, he was elected to the fellowship vacated by John Wilson. He proceeded to the M.A. in 1790, and returned to Liverpool, but in 1793, after the declaration of war with France, his father's bank failed, and it became necessary for him to earn his living. Through Edward Morris, a college friend, Smyth was chosen in 1793 by Richard Brinsley Sheridan as tutor to his elder son Thomas. He lived with his pupil at Wanstead, at Bognor, and at Cambridge, and saw much of Sheridan himself; but the relationship was troublesome both personally and financially. When Smyth accompanied his pupil to Cambridge in 1803, he received bills on the Drury Lane Theatre for his expenses. In 1806 Thomas went into the army, and Smyth became tutor of Peterhouse. In 1807, on the recommendation of his political friends, Smyth was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History, a post he kept until his death. In 1825 he inherited property, and, in accordance with the college statutes then in force, his fellowship was declared vacant. He continued, however, to occupy his rooms in college, until in 1847 he retired to Norwich, where he died, unmarried, on 24 June 1849. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, where there is a stained-glass window to his memory over his grave. ==Legacy== The two stained Munich windows in Peterhouse Chapel, representing the Nativity and the Ascension, were subscribed for as a memorial to him. There is a portrait of him in the hall of Peterhouse, given by his brother, the Rev. Thomas Smyth (1778‚Äì1854), fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, from 1800 to 1813, and vicar of St. Austell. This portrait is lithographed in the fifth edition of his English Lyrics, edited by his brother in 1850. The posthumous bust in the Fitzwilliam Museum, by E. H. Baily, is copied from the picture. ==Works== * A List of Books Recommended (1817; 2nd ed. 1828) * Memoir of Sheridan (1840) (privately printed). * Lectures on Modern History (2 vols.)

Both sets of lectures were reissued with author's corrections in Bohn's Standard Library (1855). Smyth wrote much verse, and his English Lyrics, published in 1797, which were praised by the Edinburgh Review, ran through five editions. Thomas Moore's opinion of them was less favorable: he accused Smyth of appropriating his metres and parodying his songs. Smyth contributed some of the words to Clarke Whitfield's Twelve Vocal Songs, and wrote the ode for the installation of Prince William Frederick as chancellor of the university. Smyth devoted his last years to a work on the Evidences of Christianity.‚Äô Smyth is \\"the Professor\\" in Reminiscences of Thought and Feeling by Mary Ann Kelty. ==References== * ==Notes== ;Attribution ==Further reading== *Hedva Ben-Israel, William Smyth, Historian of the French Revolution, Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 21, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1960), pp. 571‚Äì585.

In 1939 World War II was declared and the Football League was cancelled. In its place were formed War Leagues and cups, based on geographical lines rather than based on previous league placement. However, none of these were considered to be competitive football, and thus their records are not recognised by the Football League and thus not included in official records. ==Season review== With so many players unable to get leave from the army on matchdays this gave the club a perfect opportunity to field several younger players and when Stoke kicked off the 1940‚Äì41 season against Notts County on 31 August 1940 they fielded a side with an average age of 21. Several clubs did not play as many matches as others during the season and Stoke, well below strength and lacking in form, conceded a remarkable 23 goals in just four games in December and January. Stoke's back line caved in regularly and seven goals were put past them on three occasions at Mansfield, Northampton and Walsall. Stoke finished 25th (out of 34) in the final South Regional League this season when a points average decided league placings rather than points simply because some teams did not play as many games as others e.g. Birmingham played 16 and Stoke 36. ==Final league table== * Note: Due to the inconsistent number of matches played by teams in 1940‚Äì41, positions were decided by goal-average. ==Results== Stoke's score comes first  Legend  {  style=\\"background-color: #CCFFCC;\\"Win style=\\"background-color: #FFFFCC;\\"Draw style=\\"background-color: #FFCCCC;\\"Loss } War League South Regional Championship {  style=\\"font-size:100%;

The term serf (loose translation from Russian 'krepostnoy') stands for an unfree person who, unlike a slave, can only be sold with the land they are \\"attached\\" to. In 2013, the Global Slavery Index reported on unsatisfactory living conditions of migrant workers who, for a number of reasons, cannot obtain work permits in Russia but continue to work in the country illegally and for minimum wage.http://lft.ee/admin/upload/files/GlobalSlaveryIndex_2013_Download_WEB1.pdf ==History== In Kievan Rus' and Muscovy, legal systems usually referred to slaves as kholopy. A kholop's master had unlimited power over his life: he could kill him, sell him, or use him as payment upon a debt. The master, however, had responsibility before the law for his kholop's actions. Individuals could become kholop as a result of capture, selling themselves, being sold for debts, committing crimes, or marriage to a kholop. Until the late 10th century, the kholopy represented a majority among the servants who worked lords' lands. The Russian lands continued in their historic function as a source of slaves for outsiders. Note the traditional etymology of the word \\"slave\\" from the ethnonym Slav: For example, in 1382 the Golden Horde under Khan Tokhtamysh sacked Moscow, burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves; similar raids occurred routinely until well into the 16th century.The Full Collection of the Russian Annals, vol.13, SPb, 1904 In 1521, the combined forces of Crimean Khan Mehmed I Giray and his Kazan allies attacked Moscow and captured thousands of slaves.Supply of Slaves In 1571, the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, burning everything but the Kremlin and taking thousands of captives as slaves. In Crimea, about 75% of the population consisted of slaves.Historical survey > Slave societies Crimean‚ÄìNogai raids into East Slavic lands continued into the 18th century. Russian slavery did not have racial restrictions. Russian girls were legally allowed to be sold in Novgorod to Tatars from Kazan in the 1600s by Russian law. Germans, Poles, and Lithuanians were allowed to be sold to Crimean Tatars in Moscow. In 1665 Tatars were allowed to buy from the Russians, Polish and Lithuanian slaves. Before 1649 Russians could be sold to Muslims under Russian law in Moscow. This contrasted with other places in Europe outside Russia where Muslims were not allowed to own Christians. An anonymous Lithuanian author wrote in De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum: By the sixteenth century, the slave population of the Grand Duchy of Moscow consisted mostly of those who had sold themselves into slavery owing to poverty.Richard Hellie, Slavery in Russia, 1450-1725 (1984) They worked predominantly as household servants, among the richest families, and indeed generally produced less than they consumed.Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, The Domostroi: Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible, p15 Laws forbade slave owners to free slaves in times of famine in order to avoid feeding them, and slaves generally remained with their owning family for a long time; the Domostroy, an advice book, speaks of the need to choose slaves of good character and to provide for them properly.Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, The Domostroi: Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible, p33 Slavery remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs. The government of Tsar Feodor III had formally converted Russian agricultural slaves into serfs earlier, in 1679. Compare: Indigenous peoples of Siberia ‚Äì notably the Yakuts and the Buryats of Eastern Siberia ‚Äì practised slavery on a small scale. With the conquest of Siberia in the 16th and 17th centuries, Russians enslaved natives in military operations and in Cossack raids. Cases involving native women were frequent, hold as concubines, sometimes mortgaged to other men and traded for commercial profit. The Russian government generally opposed the conversion of natives to Christianity because it would free them from paying the yasak, the fur tribute. The government decreed that the non-Christian slaves were to be freed. This in turn led local Russian owners of slaves to petition the government for conversion and even involved forced conversions of their slaves. The rules stipulated that the native convert became a serf of the converter. As an indication of the extent of the slavery system, one voyevoda reported in 1712 that \\"there is hardly a Cossack in Yakutsk who does not have natives as slaves\\". Russian conquest of the Caucasus led to the abolition of slavery by the 1860s and the conquest of the Central Asian Islamic khanates of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Khiva by the 1870s. The Russian administration liberated the slaves of the Kazakhs in 1859. A notorious slave market for captured Russian and Persian slaves was centred in the Khanate of Khiva from the 17th to the 19th century.Report of Josef Wolff 1843‚Äì1845 At the beginning of the 21st century Chechens and Ingush kept Russian captives as slaves or in slave-like conditions in the mountains of the northern Caucasus. Recent (2009‚Äì2012) reports have identified human trafficking and slavery of Uzbek and Kazakh nationals in contemporary Russian society. ==See also== *Serfdom in Russia *Lovisa von Burghausen *Forced labor in the Soviet Union *Cultural assimilation *Discrimination *Equal rights *History of slavery in Europe *History of slavery in Asia *Universal Declaration of Human Rights ==References Category:Economic history of Russia Category:Legal history of Russia Russia Category:Social history of Russia Category:Slavery in Europe Category:Human rights abuses in Russia ","title":"Slavery in Russia"},{"id":"35335032","text":"Portrait in oil Lemuel Francis Abbott William Woodville (1752‚Äì1805) was an English physician and botanist. Convinced by the work of Edward Jenner, he was among the first to promote vaccination. His four volume book on medical botany published between 1790 and 1794 with 300 illustrations of medicinal plants by James Sowerby was an important reference work for physicians in the nineteenth century with a second edition in 1810 followed by a revision in 1832 by William Jackson Hooker and George Spratt. ==Biography== William Woodville with 'View of the inoculating Hospital at Pancras' (1806). William Woodville was born at Cockermouth in Cumberland in 1752 in wealthy Quaker family. He apprenticed to the apothecary William Birtwhistle before going to study medicine at Edinburgh University, where he became the favourite pupil of William Cullen, and graduated M.D. on 12 September 1775. After spending some time on the continent he began to practise at Papcastle in his native county, but shortly afterwards moved to Denbigh. In 1778 he accidentally shot a man in his garden through his window and this led to him being disowned by the Quakers. In 1782 he came to London, became physician to the Middlesex dispensary, and was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 9 August 1784. On 17 March 1791 he was elected physician to the smallpox and inoculation hospitals at St. Pancras, in succession to Edward Archer, and published the first volume of a projected two-part history of inoculation (variolation) in 1796. However, he became particularly interested in Edward Jenner's introduction of what was soon to be known as smallpox vaccine, which used material obtained from cases of cowpox. He was one of the first to try the new method, but his results differed substantially from Jenner's, and there was disagreement about the effects of the new procedure. It was suspected at the time that Woodville's vaccine had become contaminated with material from his smallpox patients, a conclusion supported by detailed analysis of the evidence. Woodville, who was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1791, had a strong taste for botany, and appropriated two acres of ground at King's Cross belonging to the hospital as a botanical garden, which he maintained at his own expense. He wrote an important study of medical botany. Woodville, who was a member of the Society of Friends, had his residence in Ely Place, Holborn, but died at the smallpox hospital on 26 March 1805, and was buried in the Friends' burial-ground, Bunhill Fields, on 4 April. His portrait, by Lemuel Abbott, was presented to the smallpox hospital. It was engraved by William Bond. ==Writings== *Medical Botany, 1790, vol 2, 1792, vol 3, 1793, Supp 1794.

These objectives were set for various air pollutants. The NAAQO had three levels indicating severity (maximum desirable, acceptable and tolerable levels) and also evaluated effect levels (maximum desirable, acceptable and tolerable levels). In 1992, a review of the NAAQOs suggested that many air pollutants had no effect thresholds (e.g. tropospheric ozone or very low effect thresholds). As such, scientifically defensible effect levels could not be identified. In 2000, the revised NAAQOs framework specifies a Reference Level, above which there are demonstrated effects on human health and/or the environment, and an Air Quality Objective (AQO), which is meant to be protective for the general public and environment and which also considers aspects of technical feasibility. This approach is different from how the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are set in the US, where cost is explicitly not considered in the proposal to strengthen the air quality standards to protect human health and the environment. In addition, the US NAAQS are periodically reviewed, frequently strengthened, commonly enforced and allow serious legal penalties if the standards are not met. In contrast, the Canadian NAAQOs are infrequently reviewed, rarely strengthened, not enforced, and the only penalty for not meeting the Canadian NAAQOs is shame. The original NAAQOs have not been formally revised to the new two-level system. As an interim approach, data are compared with the existing desirable and acceptable NAAQOs for sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. The air quality objectives must be consistent with the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) 1999. They must also be based on scientific principles, such as risk assessment and risk management. The NAAQOs are set by the federal government based on recommendations from a National Advisory Committee and Working Group on Air Quality Objectives and Guidelines. Provincial governments have the option of adopting these either as objectives or as enforceable standards according to their legislation. ==References== * Environment Canada's page on the NAAQOs, April 30, 2004 Category:Environmental law in Canada Category:Air pollution Category:Air pollution in Canada ","title":"National Ambient Air Quality Objectives"},{"id":"35335039","text":"Herbert J. Hoelter is an American criminal justice consultant and prison consultant. The Associated Press and Boston Globe recognized him as a pioneer in the field of federal sentencing mitigation. He is an expert in sentencing, creative alternatives to incarceration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). He is chairman and CEO of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives (NCIA), a group he co-founded along with Dr. Jerome G. Miller in 1977. Hoelter himself has never been incarcerated. The New York Post and Fox News have labeled him as a \\"prison coach.\\" He prefers \\"professional federal sentencing consultant\\", and describes his work as assisting with the \\"transition from freedom to incarceration.\\" ==Early years== Hoelter completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Buffalo, earning a Bachelor of Arts. He then obtained a Masters of Social Work from Marywood University in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ==Career and NCIA== Beginning in 1977, Hoelter and the organization he co-founded, NCIA, have worked with criminal defense lawyers in developing client-specific sentencing alternatives for defendants facing sentences in state and federal court. He led the NCIA's sentencing and parole services, which has prepared cases in all 50 states, 75 federal jurisdictions, and three countries. In total, more than 15,000 cases have been presented by the NCIA for consideration by sentencing courts and parole boards. Prior to sentencing, Hoelter and his colleagues at the NCIA present recommendations for alternative sentences and work on clients' behalf to secure appropriate prison placement, typically minimum security facilities where the risk of violence is low. They also document the circumstances of a crime, and outline the redeeming qualities of the individual to contrast the prosecution's portrayal. Once a sentence has been handed down, the organization works to help inmates assimilate into the culture of prison life from a practical and psychological standpoint. Arrangements and conditions for family visitation, mail, commissary, telephone privileges, and items permitted inside are thoroughly explained. Hoelter has also advocated for prison reform and creative alternatives to incarceration. He offers alternatives such as work release, community incarceration, drug rehabilitation centers, home detention, community service, and strict probation aided by GPS monitoring. In June 1987 he testified before the United States Sentencing Commission on the issue of alternatives to incarceration, and again submitted testimony to the Sentencing Commission in July 2008 at a national conference on same issue. ==Clients== Hoelter focuses on white-collar defendants in federal cases, and has represented prior to and post sentencing Bernard L. Madoff,Martha Stewart, Michael Vick, Michael Milken, Leona Helmsley, Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby and Mike Tyson, as well as politicians, foreign nationals, husband wife or family defendants, independent business people and Wall Street executives such as Ivan Boesky, Dennis B. Levine, and James McDermott. He is also a speaker, and provides testimony to government panels and professional and academic audiences on the criminal justice system and punishment alternatives that do not involve imprisonment. He also provided consulting services for a number of Enron executives in the early 1990s. Since 2000 he has worked with criminal defense attorneys Ira Sorkin and Billy Martin (lawyer). Hoelter advised Bernard L. Madoff on medical care, before Madoff began a 150-year federal prison sentence for financial crime. While acknowledging the havoc caused by Madoff's fraudulent activities, Hoelter described the sentence as \\"the crown jewel\\" for the federal government and one imposed for \\"symbolic purposes.\\" In the majority of cases featuring well-known clients, Hoelter has managed to develop court-approved sentencing proposals which produced more lenient sentences featuring substantial amounts of community service and home confinement. When clients receive more stringent prison terms, as was the case for Vick, Hoelter works to help the client resume life outside of prison, focusing on re-entry back into society. ==Sentencing database== To develop a better understanding of federal sentencing history, Hoelter and the NCIA in 2008 completed analysis of a computerized data collection maintained by The United States Sentencing Commission. The database is housed at the University of Michigan. NCIA reviewed the data sets for fiscal years 1999-2009. The information generated by the NCIA's review is intended as a frame of reference for judges deciding fines and imprisonment terms. == References  * *Fox News Interviews Herbert Hoelter on his work with Bernie Madoff Category:American consultants Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:Marywood University alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Herbert J.

After being dropped from a solo contract with Def Jam Recordings, Gaga worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where Akon helped her sign a joint deal with Interscope Records and his own label KonLive Distribution. After signing with Interscope, Gaga began working on her debut album The Fame, which was released in 2008. It produced the global chart-topping singles \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\". She collaborated with different producers, primarily RedOne, Fernando Garibay, Martin Kierszenbaum, and Rob Fusari. The album has influences of the 1980s pop music and discusses Gaga's love for fame while also dealing with subjects such as love, sexuality, money and drugs. Initially intended to be a re-release of her first album, an EP titled The Fame Monster (2009) included eight newly recorded tracks. Its tracks include \\"Speechless\\", written solely by Gaga, as well as \\"Alejandro\\", \\"Telephone\\" and \\"Bad Romance\\". The EP explores the darker side of fame. Gaga's second full-length album, Born This Way, was released in 2011. She reunited with RedOne and Garibay, and sought new collaborators, including DJ Snake, DJ White Shadow, Jeppe Laursen, and Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, this last one producing the country rock song \\"You and I\\" written solely by Gaga. The album's themes include sexuality, religion, freedom, feminism and individualism. Primarily influenced by synthpop and dance-pop, it incorporated musical genres which had not been previously explored by Gaga, such as electronic rock and techno. \\"Americano\\" and \\"Schei√üe\\" included Spanish and faux-German lyrics, respectively. Gaga's third album Artpop, released in 2013, included the singles \\"Applause\\" and \\"Do What U Want\\". As executive producer, she enlisted longtime collaborators DJ White Shadow and RedOne, and for the first time Zedd and Madeon. Described as \\"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\\", the album revolves around her personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny. In 2014, Gaga and Tony Bennett released a collaborative album titled Cheek to Cheek, which consists of jazz standards and swing classics from composers such as George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington and Irving Berlin. Her fifth studio album, Joanne (2016), which had Mark Ronson as the executive producer, is a more personal album, with family influences. In 2020, she released Chromatica, a house music influenced album with lyrics that cover themes such as mental health, depression and finding love through hardship, that features guest vocals from Ariana Grande on \\"Rain on Me\\", Blackpink on \\"Sour Candy\\", and Elton John on \\"Sine from Above\\". In addition to her studio work, Gaga has recorded songs for film soundtracks, including \\"Fashion\\" from Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009), and \\"Til It Happens to You\\" from The Hunting Ground (2015). She and Bradley Cooper recorded the soundtrack for the movie A Star Is Born, released in 2018, which they composed with others collaborators.

She wrote Toward a New Psychology of Women, which brings psychological thought together with relational-cultural theory.Jean Baker Miller wcwonline.org Retrieved October 23, 2019. ==Early life and education== Jean Baker Miller was born on September 29, 1927 in the Bronx in New York City to a Jewish family.Jewish Women's Archives: \\"Psychology in the United States\\" by Rhoda K. Unger Retrieved October 23, 2019. She was diagnosed with polio at an early age, and was inspired to pursue a career in medicine while in the care of nurses. She attended Hunter College High School in New York City and in '48 graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. She received her M.D. from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1952, and was in New York for psychiatric residency programs at Montefiore Medical Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Upstate Medical Center, New York Medical College, where she completed her psychoanalytic training. ==Work and publications== Miller opened a private practice in New York, and then moved to Boston in 1973. She edited Psychoanalysis and Women: Contributions to New Theory and Therapy (1973), and then wrote Toward a New Psychology of Women (1976), which has become a classic in its field and has been translated into twenty languages. Miller describes the \\"relational model\\" of human development (\\"Relational-Cultural Theory\\"), proposing that \\"growth-fostering relationships are a central human necessity and that disconnections are the source of psychological problems.\\" Inspired by Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, and other feminist classics from the 1960s, Relational-Cultural Theory proposes that \\"isolation is one of the most damaging human experiences and is best treated by reconnecting with other people,\\" and that therapists should \\"foster an atmosphere of empathy and acceptance for the patient, even at the cost of the therapist‚Äôs neutrality.\\"New York Times: \\"Jean Baker Miller, 78, Psychiatrist, Is Dead\\" By Jeremy Pearce August 8, 2006. The theory is based on clinical observations and sought to prove that \\"there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them.\\" Following the publication of Toward a New Psychology of Women, Miller became the first director of the Stone Center for Developmental Services and Studies at Wellesley College, which incorporated the relational model into all aspects of the Stone Center's treatment. In 1986, she became the Director of Education for the Stone Center, where she established a group discussion program to share ideas about the relational model and published these ideas as \\"Working Papers\\" through the center. In 1991, she published her second book, Women's Growth in Connection: Writings from the Stone Center, co-authored with Judith V. Jordan, Alexandra G. Kaplan, Irene P. Stiver, and Janet L. Surrey. Her third book, The Healing Connection: How Women Form Relationships in Therapy and in Life, co-authored with Irene Pierce Stiver, Ph.D. was published in 1997. Miller also served as a clinical professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine and was a faculty member at Harvard Medical School, and practiced psychiatry at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She was a member of the American College of Psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Orthopsychiatric Association and the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. ==Jean Baker Miller Training Institute== In 1995, Jean Baker Miller established the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute (JBMTI) at the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College, an organization that seeks to \\"promote social change by expanding definitions and societal norms of personal strength, human health, and cultural wellbeing.Relational-Cultural Theory wcwonline.org Retrieved October 23, 2019.

William Lewis \\"Skip\\" Stewart (born February 9, 1968), better known as Skip Stewart, is an aerobatic and commercial pilot from the United States. Stewart flies in airshows in the United States and abroad, in his two highly modified Pitts muscle biplanes. == Early years and introduction to aviation == Skip Stewart was born in Decatur, Alabama and was introduced to aviation by his grandfather, who worked as a crop-duster, and took Skip flying in a Piper PA-18 Super Cub and a Piper Twin Comanche. He went to his first airshow at around fourteen years of age, which is where he recalls his interest in aerobatics was born by watching the great Leo Loudenslager fly == Commercial aviation career == Stewart attended Middle Tennessee State University, graduating with a major in Aerospace Administration (with a minor in Psychology). While in college, he acquired his Private, Commercial, Multi-engine, CFI, CFII and MEI licenses, and instructed until the summer after he graduated. He then worked for Northwest Airlink (Northeast Express), flying as a first officer for 15 months. After a brief stint towing gliders in a Maule, he flew for a UPS feeder for six months before being hired by the Southern Company, where he flew King Air, Citation II, and Citation V aircraft as captain. == Aerobatics career ==  Aircraft and competitive aerobatics  Stewart had flown RC model aircraft for many years and was very familiar with aerobatics, and at age nineteen, he flew an aerobatic aircraft for the first time, a Bucker Jungmann with his friend Chris Woodward. Stewart‚Äôs first airplane was a 1976 Pitts S-2A, which he sold in 2000 to buy a 1979 Pitts S-2S. He spent several off seasons modifying this aircraft into what would eventually become the original version of his trademark Prometheus muscle biplane. In 2011 he bought a second aircraft, another 1979 Pitts S-2S and used its airframe to build a second airshow aircraft, which he named Prometheus 2 (P2). The original Pitts is now referred to as P1. The aircraft are highly customized in order to achieve superior aerobatic performance. Both have custom wings, tails, cowlings, engines, propellers, landing gear, instrument panels, fuel tanks and even seat belts. The only stock components on the two aircraft are the horizontal stabilizers. The engines produce 400 hp (compared to the 260 hp of the stock S-2S), and the aircraft are capable of +12 and -7 G, more than twice the G-limit of the stock variant. Stewart is also in the process of having a completely composite-built carbon-fiber biplane designed and built for him. Called the P3 Revolution Biplane, it is scheduled to debut in 2014. He has also built a Wittman Tailwind W-10 from scratch, later selling it to buy a 1964 Twin Comanche. He also ran an aerobatic flight school for two years in Pensacola, FL by the name of ‚ÄúPensacola Aerobatics‚Äù, flying his S-2A. He also entered in several aerobatic competitions during this time, winning many Gold Medals in regional competitions. He won two Pitts Trophies (Awarded to the highest scoring Pitts pilot in any category) and was crowned the South Eastern Aerobatic Champion in the Intermediate category in 2000 (the only contest he flew in his stock Pitts S-2S) Stewart was honored as the recipient of the 2013 Bill Barber Award for Showmanship, given to one pilot per year for demonstrating superior showmanship. Stewart states that he was honored and humbled to receive the award, and that is the most prestigious award he has ever received. The award recipient is voted on by previous recipients of the award.I asked Skip Stewart and he told me  Airshow performances  Skip Stewart is best known for his high-energy aerobatics routine, which includes very low and slow knife- edge passes. His performances most often involve transitioning into slow knife-edge flight immediately after takeoff, followed by an outside-banked turn as he sets up for his routine. The performances themselves involve extreme positive and negative G maneuvers, utilizing the full performance and maneuvering envelopes of his aircraft. He is known for performing a double ribbon-cut, in which he slices the first (upper) ribbon with his aircraft‚Äôs vertical tail while in inverted flight, and the second (lower) ribbon with his lower wing while in sustained knife-edge flight. Stewart‚Äôs showmanship typically continues till the very end of his performances, as he lands on one wheel, and then performs smoking doughnuts on the taxiway. Stewart holds the distinction of being the first pilot to fly under a jumping motorcycle at an airshow. He also flies knife-edge while racing cars and trucks on the runway, including the Shockwave jet truck. He has even done a ribbon transfer from the back of a pickup truck to his wing while traveling at 70 mph in knife-edge flight. Stewart was a member of the X-Team and flew Codename Mary‚Äôs Lamb with Jim Leroy. He happened to be flying with him on the day Leroy crashed his aircraft and died. The following day, Stewart flew his Pitts biplane in a touching salute to Leroy. He continued the show by flying Tinstix of Dynamite with pilots such as Jurgis Kairys, Patty Wagstaff, Melissa Pemberton and Gary Ward. He also flies a similar show called ‚ÄúMayhem‚Äù with John Mohr. In addition to utilizing jet trucks to add to the spectacle, these shows also make heavy use of synchronized pyrotechnics provided by Rich‚Äôs Incredible Pyro. In addition to his airshow routines, Stewart makes it a point to make himself available to airshow fans and enthusiasts, and enjoys interacting with the crowd. He trains hard in order to maintain the physical fitness required to withstand the intense stress of high-G flight. Even though he jokingly refers to himself as ‚ÄúPiloto Loco‚Äù, he emphasizes that safety is always the first priority, and must be balanced with entertainment. == References  External links == * Skip Stewart Airshows * Skip Stewart Airshows 2011 promo * Skip Stewart Airshows 2009 promo * Skip Stewart Airshows 2007 promo Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:People from Decatur, Alabama Category:Middle Tennessee State University alumni Category:Aerobatic pilots Category:Commercial aviators ","title":"Skip Stewart"},{"id":"35335076","text":"The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597 was a series of nationwide witch trials that took place in the whole of Scotland from March to October 1597. At least 400 people were put on trial for witchcraft and various forms of diabolism during the witch hunt. The exact number of those executed is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597 was the second of five nationwide witch hunts in Scottish history, the others being The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1590‚Äì91, The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1628‚Äì1631, The Great Scottish witch hunt of 1649‚Äì50 and The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1661‚Äì62. ==History== The Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597 is the least documented of the five nationwide Scottish witch hunts. As the latter ones, it was conducted by local courts under the supervision of royal commissions, but in contrast to the others, it was not documented by the central authorities, and the local records are often missing. It is not known what caused the Witch Hunt of 1597, but at the time, Scotland experienced a political conflict between the monarch and the Presbyterian Church, as well as plague and famine. In Edinburgh, a witch trial took place in 1596, when Christian Stewart was accused of having bewitched Patrick Ruthven to death, a case in which the king took a personal interest. This was also the same year as the king James VI published his book about witchcraft, Daemonologie. In July 1597 James VI spent nine days at St Andrews investigating preaching at the university and attending the trials of witches. There was said to be large number of witches of several sorts (social classes) who had dedicated themselves to the devil and had a witches mark. Sir Robert Bowes heard the trials would be published. In August Bowes heard that a witch MacKolme Anderson and others had attempted to drown the king at Dundee by witchcraft and others had tried to kill Prince Henry.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 56, 73. Suspected witches kneeling before King James VI; Daemonologie (1597) The earliest cases recorded seem to have taken place in Slains north of Aberdeen in March 1597, where the local authorities asked for permission to execute witches. This was followed by a large witch trial in Aberdeen against Janet Wishart and her accomplices. Wishart was alleged to have used a cantrip (spell) to cause one victim to alternately shiver and sweat, bewitched other victims so that they died or nearly died, raised storms via the throwing out of live coals, used \\"nightmare cats\\" to inflict horrible dreams, and dismembered a corpse hanging at the gallows. She was executed by burning along with another witch. Several royal commissions were sent to investigate sorcery in many parts of the country. The witch hunt seem to have been most frequent in Fife, Perthshire, Glasgow, Stirlingshire and especially Aberdeenshire, all between 4 March and October. The best-known case was that of Margaret Aitken, called The Great Witch of Balwearie. She was likely arrested in Fife in April 1597. After having pleaded guilty under torture, she offered to help the commission to identify witches in all parts of the country in exchange for her life. During a period of four months, the Aitken commission visited several parts of Scotland and many people were arrested, put on trial and executed after having been pointed out by her. Eventually Aitken was discredited as expert witness after declaring innocent the same people she had identified as witches when she saw them previously. On 1 August she was stopped, and on 12 August, the commissions were ordered to end the trials until the claims could be better examined. Fewer death sentences seem to have been issued subsequently, and by October the witch hunt seems to have stopped. == References  Further reading == * Category:Witch trials in Scotland Category:16th century in Scotland Category:1597 in law Category:1597 in Scotland Category:Torture in Scotland Category:Trials in Scotland ","title":"Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597"},{"id":"35335104","text":"The old station building Part of the collection The International Police Caps Collection is a permanent exhibition of an international collection of police hats in the former railway station of the Slochteren Woldjerspoor in Slochteren.

Grand Portage is 34 miles northeast of the city of Grand Marais and 5 miles southwest of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Minnesota Highway 61 serves as a main route in the community. The unincorporated community of Grand Portage and the Grand Portage Indian Reservation are both within Grand Portage Unorganized Territory of Cook County (population 565). The Grand Portage National Monument is adjacent to the community. Grand Portage State Park is nearby on the banks of the Pigeon River. Mount Josephine (elevation 1,315) is immediately northeast of Grand Portage (elevation 630). ==History== In the 17th century, Grand Portage became a major center of the fur trade on the Canadian canoe routes. A major canoe fur trade route of the voyageurs left the Great Lakes there, which got its name from the fact that the route began with a nine-mile portage.Fur Trade Canoe Routes of Canada/ Then and Now by Eric W. Morse Canada National and Historic Parks Branch, first printing 1969, p. 75., where the canoes and equipment were carried over land. The French established this trade with the Native Americans until the British took it over in the 18th century after the Seven Years' War. The North West Company established the area as its regional headquarters. Grand Portage soon became one of Britain's four main fur trading posts, along with Niagara, Detroit, and Michilimackinac.Gilman (1992), p. 74. Even after the American Revolutionary War and victory by the rebellious colonists, the British continued to operate in the area. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain had to cede former territory to the United States, including this area. Finally, with the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1796, defining the northern border between Canada and the US, British traders planned to move from Grand Portage since they wanted to avoid the taxes the US put on their operations, in its effort to encourage American traders instead. In 1802, the traders planned to move north to create a new center, what they called Fort William. In 1803, following the Louisiana Purchase, in which the US acquired the lands to the west of Grand Portage, the British finally moved from Grand Portage to the new post in Canada.Association of Ontario Land Surveyors (1902), p. 108. The North West Company moved its headquarters northward to what they named Fort William. After British fur traders abandoned the area, it rapidly declined economically until fisheries and logging became popular in the 19th century. ==Geography== The community of Grand Portage is 34 miles northeast of Grand Marais, 6 miles southwest of the Canada‚ÄìUS border, 146 miles northeast of Duluth, and 43 miles southwest of Thunder Bay. Grand Portage is the home of Grand Portage Lodge and Casino. The island of Isle Royale in Lake Superior is located 15 miles east of the port of Grand Portage. The island and the 450 surrounding smaller islands make up Isle Royale National Park. The island of Isle Royale is 45 miles long and 9 miles wide. The Sea Hunter, Voyageur II, and Wenonah passenger ferries all run out of Grand Portage and travel to the port of Windigo, on the western end of Isle Royale. The ferries pass by Rock of Ages Lighthouse near Windigo. The Voyageur II passenger ferry also travels further to the port of Rock Harbor on the eastern end of Isle Royale. Scheduled toll ferry service from Grand Portage to Isle Royale runs from May to October.

With Nunavut's separation from the Northwest Territories came a need for new regulations regarding cultural history. Nunavut has the unique experience of having a large Aboriginal community that creates strong cultural ties within the legislation. ==Aboriginal Ties== The Aboriginal ties within Nunavut are clear without knowing the territory; one just needs to view the flag. \\"The colors, blue and gold symbolize the riches of the land, sea and sky. Red is a reference to Canada. The inuksuk symbolizes stone monuments which guide people on the land and mark sacred and other special places.\\" The North Star is also featured on the flag symbolizing the leadership of elders in the community. These are clear markers that there is a strong relationship between archaeology and the Aboriginal community, therefore creating relevance with the government's cultural and archaeological practices. There are several environmental and archaeological policies and programs that are run by both Inuit and government members. The Government of Nunavut lists Archaeology and Paleontology under the department of Culture and Heritage. Once again there is evidence of the close ties between elders and archaeology and therefore culture. This branch was established to provide leadership within the Government of Nunavut in the implementation and development of services, policies, and programs that are aimed to strengthen the culture, language, heritage and physical activity of Nunavut. The Nunavut Archaeology Program administers the archaeology and paleontology permitting process and work on the development of policies, technical standards and guidelines. Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) ensures that promises made under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NCLA) are carried out. One of the main NCLA concerns are that the Inuit exchanged their Aboriginal title to all their traditional land in the Nunavut Settlement Area for the rights and benefits. Rights and benefits are focused on land, wildlife, and water, as these are very important aspects to the Inuit way of life. NTI coordinates and manages Inuit responsibilities set out in the NCLA and makes sure that all federal and territorial governments fulfill their obligations such as help with travel between communities, the care of elders, and help with education. There is also the Inuit Qauijimajatuqangt Katimajiit, which is a prestigious group of wise and talented Inuit who are responsible for advising the government on making programs and services more culturally relevant. The people selected for the group are appointed from outside the Government of Nunavut. A smaller scale project is the Oral History Project which claims \\"Recording and documenting the traditional knowledge and history of Elders is a priority\\" and help retain the Inuit Language. ==References== Category:Archaeology of Canada Category:Natural history of Nunavut ","title":"Archaeology in Nunavut"},{"id":"35335264","text":"Edmund Waring (c 1638 - 1687) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1660 and 1687.

Marqui's Who's Who in the World. 2012. 29th Edition. is an educator and researcher who works mainly on aspects of behavior and behavioral ecology of whales and dolphins.Cahill T. 2000. Dolphins. National Geographic Society, Washington, DC. 216 pp. Much of his early work was done in close collaboration with his wife Melany Ann W√ºrsig (born Carballeira), and they have published numerous manuscripts and books together. He is now Professor Emeritus at Texas A&M; University, teaching only occasionally but still involved with graduate student and other research. He is especially active with problems and potential solutions concerning Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in and surrounding waters of Hong Kong. == Early Career and Education == Bernd W√ºrsig is the youngest of three sons of Gerhard and Charlotte W√ºrsig, Silesian refugees who moved to (then) West Germany after the 2nd World War, and to the United States under a refugee family visa in 1956. They settled in Ohio, and W√ºrsig became interested as a boy in marine mammals after reading books by the Austrian explorers Hans Hass and Lotte Hass, French Jacques Cousteau, and American John Cunningham Lilly.Grady D. 2003. More Grady‚Äôs People. Pp. 157-170 ‚ÄúU.S. dolphin professor who loves Kaikoura‚Äù. Nikau Press, Nelson, New Zealand. He went to Ohio State University, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology (minor in Germanic Literature) in 1971. W√ºrsig went to Stony Brook University (then the State University of New York at Stony Brook), 1971-1978, in an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program with advisors in the Departments of Marine Science, Ecology and Evolution, and Neurobiology and Behavior. His advisors in the latter two, George Williams in Ecology and Evolution and Charles Walcott in Neurobiology and Behavior, had a strong influence on W√ºrsig‚Äôs career, as the former imbued him with a sense of the wonders of animal social/sexual strategies, and the latter with a lifelong appreciation for how to think about animal capabilities, relative to our own capabilities of observation with basic tools such as binoculars to sophisticated radio, theodolite, and other remote sensing techniques. W√ºrsig's field advisor Roger Payne, the discoverer of humpback whale song and long-range communication in fin and blue whales, was his mentor during field work on dolphins in coastal Patagonia, Argentina. W√ºrsig also worked with Kenneth S. Norris,Norris KS. 1994. Introduction. Pp. 1-13 in Norris KS, W√ºrsig B, Wells RS, W√ºrsig M, eds. The Hawaiian Spinner Dolphin. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA. University of California at Santa Cruz, 1978-1981, as a National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation post-doctoral fellow, and then became assistant professor at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, central California, where he went through the professor ranks in the 1980s, becoming full professor in spring 1989. That year, he and Melany and their two children Paul and Kim moved to Texas A&M; University, where he started the Marine Mammal Research Program (now Marine Mammal Behavioral Ecology Group). == Teaching == Until Spring 2018, W√ºrsig taught undergraduate and graduate courses in aspects of marine mammalogy, specializing in behavior and behavioral ecology. He has published widely in the popular literature as part of teaching endeavors, such as for the journals Natural History and Scientific American, and he has been advisor to numerous movies made for television, as well as the IMAX movie ‚ÄúDolphins‚Äù (2000) that was nominated for an Academy Award, Best Documentary Short Subject. He formerly led field courses on marine bird and mammal biology in Argentina, Mexico, Spain, China, New Zealand, Greece, Alaska, and elsewhere, but as Professor Emeritus does so only occasionally. == Research == Most of W√ºrsig‚Äôs research, while focused generally on social, sexual, calf rearing, and foraging strategies, has been related to human use of the marine environment, as well as tucuxi and boto dolphins of the Amazon and the now believed to be extinct baiji of the Yangtze River. He may be the only researcher to have worked with both the baiji and the presently highly endangered vaquita, or Gulf of California harbor porpoise of the northern Gulf of California, Mexico. Besides working with river dolphins in Peru and China, W√ºrsig has worked with oceanic whales in Argentina, far east Russia, and the Arctic; and a host of delphinids from the Bahamas to Patagonia Argentina,Lichter AA. 1992. Tracks in the Sand, Shadows on the Sea: Marine Mammals of Argentina and Antarctica. Ediciones Terra Nova, Buenos Aires. 287 pp. from north-central California to Hong Kong and South Island New Zealand. A summary of his research life, especially as related to social strategies, is presented by Grady (2003). Much of his work has been collaborative, and he has published with students and colleagues on issues of multi-species interactions among pinnipeds and cetaceans, marine mammals and marine birds, and noise pollution and mitigative effects. His present work is with Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins in Hong Kong, dusky dolphins on the South Island of New Zealand, and western gray whales of far east Russia, all collaboratively with graduate students. Bernd W√ºrsig and his wife Melany W√ºrsig first described the lives of dusky dolphins, with day/night, seasonal, and overall habitat use patterns.Evans PGH. 1987. The Natural History of Whales and Dolphins. Pp. 177-178. Facts On File Publications, NY. They then went on to describe foraging strategies of dusky dolphins that herd anchovy and communicate with each other within and between groups,Griffin DR. 1992. Animal Minds. P. 61. University of Chicago University Press, Chicago, IL. with an important communication mode apparently mediated by leaping.Connor RC, Peterson DM. 1994. The Lives of Whales and Dolphins. P. 39. Henry Holt and Co, NY. Bernd and Melany W√ºrsig also developed detailed non-invasive photographic recognition of dolphins, a technique now used by hundreds of researchers worldwide,Samuels A, Tyack PL. 2000. Flukeprints: A history of studying cetacean societies. Pp. 36-37 In: Cetacean Studies: Field Studies of Dolphins and Whales. J Mann, RC Connor, PL Tyack, H Whitehead (eds).

The Ecology of Whales and Dolphins, Pp. 128-129. Heinemann Press, London UK. a now common-accepted concept for many species and populations. W√ºrsig also accepted two ideas of the great biologist Roger Payne, his field mentor during Ph.D. work, and expanded these throughout much of his own research. One was the development of theodolite tracking of near-shore cetaceans and boats;Gailey G, Ortega-Ortiz JG. 2002. A computer- based system for cetacean theodolite tracking. Journal of Cetacean Research and Management 4(2):213-218. the other was identification photos and behavioral descriptions of animals from circling aircraft, with which much behavioral description of bowhead whales, was facilitated by W√ºrsig in the U.S. and Canadian Arctic.Burns JJ, Montague JJ, Cowles CJ. 1993. The Bowhead Whale. Society for Marine Mammalogy Special Publication, Allen Press, Lawrence KS. This work led to detailed descriptions of surface foraging and social behavior, as well as the fact that bowhead whales at times feed on bottom- dwelling organisms.Wells RS, Boness DJ, Rathbun GB. 1999. Behavior. Pp. 356-357 In: Biology of Marine Mammals. Reynolds JE III, SA Rommel (eds). Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC.

Immigration to Australia is administered by the Department of Home Affairs, formerly the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP), and before that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the majority of people in Australia illegally are visa overstayers, who enter the country legally but remain there after the expiry or revocation of their visa.Population Growth: Coming to Australia, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 6 June 2001. DIAC estimated that in the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, approximately 15,800 people overstayed their visas out of 4.5 million temporary entrants during that period (about 0.35 per cent). As of 30 June 2010, DIAC estimated that the number of visa overstayers in Australia was around 53,900, or 0.2 per cent of the Australian population.Fact Sheet 86 ‚Äì Overstayers and Other Unlawful Non-citizens, Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 2012. Retrieved 24 November 2013. The article incorrectly states the percentage as 0.02%, but the numerical figure is more reliable, so we base our percentage calculation on that. ==Immigration detention== Australia operates a number of immigration detention facilities within the country, as well as several offshore processing centres. All Australian immigration detention facilities are managed by the British services company Serco on behalf of the Australian government. Australia currently has three functioning offshore centres, and ten detention centres on the mainland. A List of Australian immigration detention facilities includes Nauru, Christmas Island, and Manus Island. Mandatory detention Prior to 1992, the Migration Act 1958 permitted discretionary detainment of unlawful non- citizens. In 1992, the Keating Government introduced a policy of mandatory detention, in response to a wave of boat arrivals from Indochina.Janet Phillips and Harriet Spinks: Immigration detention in Australia, Social Policy Section, Parliamentary Library, 20 March 2013; Migration Act 1958 (Cth) s 189. ==Asylum seekers== As a signatory to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Australia operates a humanitarian intake of migrants of around 13,770 persons per year (by comparison, Australia's Migration Program was 168,600 places in 2009‚Äì10). Those who have not gained prior approval to enter Australia for the purpose of seeking asylum were referred to as irregular arrivals.Humanitarian Arrivals, Year Book 2011, Australian Bureau of Statistics, 24 May 2012. There are two classifications for irregular arrivals: Illegal Maritime Arrivals (IMAs; prior to 2013 the term \\"Irregular Maritime Arrivals\\" was used) and Non-IMAs (those arriving in Australian territory without a visa by non-maritime means, such as by air). In the 2011‚Äì12 period, the number of IMAs was greater than the number of Non-IMAs for the first time.Australia and asylum seekers: the key facts you need to know, The Guardian, 2 July 2013. In 2013, the Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison, directed his department to use the term \\"illegal maritime arrivals\\" instead of the previous term \\"irregular maritime arrivals\\". The application of the term \\"illegal\\" to asylum seekers is controversial. While it is not a criminal offence to seek asylum in Australia, or to enter Australian territory without immigration documents for the purpose of seeking asylum, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Fact Check unit determined that the term was valid when referring to an arrival's entry status. In addition, the United Nations Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, to which Australia is a signatory, defines \\"illegal entry\\" as \\"crossing borders without complying with the necessary requirements for legal entry into the receiving State\\".Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air , United Nations, 2000. ==See also== *Pacific Solution *Operation Sovereign Borders *Immigration detention in Australia *Immigration to Australia *Asylum in Australia ==References== Category:Australian migration law ","title":"Illegal immigration to Australia"},{"id":"35335508","text":"Rhett Allain is an American associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University and the author of the Wired magazine science blog Dot Physics.

Its purpose was to build the foundation of a strong pribumi economic class in the competitive sense against Chinese Indonesians. ==Background== The 1950s saw increased political pressure to nationalize Dutch private companies that still existed in Indonesia at the conclusion of the Indonesian National Revolution. However, Indonesia still needed significant foreign funding and skills in order to develop the foundation of an economy that can support its population. In February 1950 President Sukarno announced to foreign companies in Indonesia that the recovery of the economy of Indonesia following the revolution requires all available funds, foreign and domestic. In 1953 the Minister of Finance Ong Eng Die stated that the role of foreign companies in the economy of Indonesia needs to be formally clarified in future national development plans. The program was devised as a means to nurture the role of Indonesian nationals in the economic development while avoiding conflict of interest with foreign companies, especially those from the Netherlands. ==Execution== The Benteng program was executed in several steps, with significant changes in each step in terms of economic opportunities and access. Its main program covered imports, as the required funds were the least. Further, the role of Dutch companies were seen to be most significant in this area, especially through large trading companies. The program started by earmarking the importation of certain goods to pribumi businesses. Requirements for obtaining general import licenses were then changed. In 1950 it was decreed importing trading companies have to have at least 70% of its shares owned by native Indonesians. In May and June 1953, increasing this percentage was considered in debate, which brought up allegations of discrimination against the Tionghoa, resulting in the dissolution of Wilopo's Cabinet. The program was reviewed in September 1955 by the Burnahuddin Harahap Cabinet and Secretary of Finance Sumitro Djojohadikusumo. Its ethnic-based requirements were scrapped and replaced by downpayment requirements. The formation of the Karya Cabinet led by Djuanda Kartawidjaja in March and April 1957 signaled the transition to a directed economy under the auspices of Guided Democracy; Benteng program was then officially stopped. ==References== * Lindblad, J.

The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agency offered a reward for information leading to his capture. He was the maker of bombs delivered for usage to several terrorist groups. He was often referred to by the nom de guerre Marwan. He was suspected of leading the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM), being part of the central command of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombings. He was suspected of hiding in Mindanao under the protection of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. Zulkifli was killed on 25 January 2015 by Special Action Force (SAF) officers during the raid that culminated in the Mamasapano clash. ==Early life== Zulkifli was born on 5 January 1966 or 5 October 1966 in Muar, Johor, Malaysia. Zulkifli was known to reference both dates in different circumstances as his date of birth. According to the FBI, he was 5 feet 6 inches tall, approximately 120 pounds, and could speak Malay, Tagalog, English, and Arabic. Zulkifli attended a boarding school in Malaysia until he trained overseas as an engineer in the USA. After his training, he abruptly left his 10 siblings and 3 children to join up with terrorist activities. ==Terrorism== Zulkifli, often going under the nom de guerre \\"Marwan\\", was suspected to be in charge of the South Eastern Asian and Indonesian terrorist group called the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM). The KMM is/was a part of the international terrorist organisation, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), of which Zulkifli was believed to be part of its central command. The JI is the main cause of the devastating 2002 Bali bombings and many other attacks in South Eastern Asia of which Zulkifli's involvement in is also suspected. Abdhir also co-founded the terrorist group Khalifa Islamiyah Mindanao. He was initially wanted by the Malaysian government for the killing of a Christian member of their Parliament in 2000, which was an attack that was backed by Al-Qaeda. Indonesian fake ID for Zulkifli under the alias \\"Hendri Lawi\\". Zulkifli was wanted for the allegation of being a supplier of bombs to various terrorist groups around the world. He was also under suspicion of teaching terrorists how to create bombs. Zulkifli, himself, was taught to make IEDs by the terrorist Azahari Husin. He was involved in the building of bombs for the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group, which brought him into brief collaborations with Umar Patek, before Patek's leaving to Pakistan, and with Khadaffy Janjalani (deceased). Zulkifli was indicted for arrest on 1 August 2007 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. While hiding in Mindanao under the protection of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), he continued to stay involved in militant Islamic activity and terrorist bombings. An anonymous military source told Gulf News that, along with other South Eastern Asian militants, Zulkifli was engaged in the training of local jihadist volunteers to join The Islamic State. This was reported after the BIFF declared its allegiance to helping ISIL's cause. Sources have estimated that during his militant activity in Mindanao he may have trained up to 300 terrorists in explosives use, detonation, and building. It was reported from news organisations on 26 January 2015, that the Jemaah Islamiyah in co-ordination with Zulkifli had planned to construct a bomb to be detonated as the papal convoy drove down T.M. Kalaw Street in Manila on 18 January. The source also claimed that another attempt on the Pope's life was planned the day before, but was thwarted by changes in the Pope's plans. Filipino police have denied the legitimacy of these reports. Family connections His brother, Rahmat Abdhir, was arrested in California for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, providing material to terrorists, false statements, and providing material to a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (Zulkifli). In an email between the two they discussed the exchange rates and prices of weapons, specifically an M60 machine gun. Further investigation showed that Rahmat had wired over 10,000 dollars to his brother. Federal agents discovered 1,000 rounds of ammunition, scopes to sniper rifles, two-way radios, military training manuals, and materials used to make bombs. Rahmat was refused bail twice, once upon his initial arrest and a second time in 2008. He is currently in custody in a California prison, contrary to unverified reports of his residence being in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he submitted his DNA to confirm his brother's demise. The FBI told Reuters that he was \\"a person familiar with the testing procedures\\", indicating they extracted his DNA previously. His brother-in-law, Taufik bin Abdul Halim was also arrested for terrorist charges in 2001 for involvement in an attempted mall bombing located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The explosive device reportedly triggered early leading to little or no injuries besides Taufik himself, who lost his leg in the explosion. After 12 years in jail for his attempted bombing, Taufik was released and flown back to Johor to be with his family after being pardoned by President of Indonesia Joko Widodo. Malaysian police have promised to monitor his actions due to his high-profile relation to Zulkifli. Zulkifli Abdhir is the cousin of Malaysian terrorist Mohamad Farik Amin (alias Zubair Zaid), who is also suspected as a main culprit in the 2002 Bali bombings. Amin is one of two Malaysians to be currently detained at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba.‚ÄòI would do it again without hesitation‚Äô, New Straits Times, 23 May 2015 ==Location and manhunt== Early reports claimed that in the Philippines, Zulkifli died during an airstrike on 2 February 2012. The Malaysian government asked for an official DNA comparison to the DNA of one of Zulkifli's siblings. DNA results were obtained from family members of Zulkifli. His body was never found despite reports of his death. The statements of his supposed death were later retracted as the manhunt continued. Von Al Haq, a spokesperson for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), claimed in 2013 that Zulkifli was being protected by Ameril Umbra Kato's Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). This claim was later corroborated by an interrogation with a detained Abu Sayyaf commander, Khair Mundos, who claimed that he travelled to the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters with Zulkifli. Local informants have also claimed Zulkifli to have visited the province of Maguindanao. The detained Abu Sayyaf leader claimed that Zulkifli, and other high ranking Jemaah Islamiyah leader, Muhamda \\"Muawiyah\\" Ali, escaped the February airstrike that was reported to have killed them in Sulu and have taken refuge with the Bangsamoro separatists. 2015 Mamasapano clash and death The Philippine National Police Special Action Force attempted an operation on 25 January 2015 to arrest Zulkifli. The operation culminated in a battle in Mamasapano between the PNP and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), breaking the ceasefire. The MILF was later joined by their breakaway group, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, in a battle that led to the death of 44 police officers, several civilians, and at least 18 militants. The Philippines mobilised more reinforcements though they were cautious in attempting to not create more civilian casualties. Reasons for the clashes and renewed hostilities are being attributed to a lack of communication between the PNP, the military, and MILF before undertaking the operation. It was thought of as \\"highly likely\\" that Zulkifli had been killed in the raid until the FBI provided DNA confirmation of his demise in the clash. ==Death== Reports say that he was killed by SAF officer(s) on 25 January 2015. Early in the morning of 25 January 2015, Zulkifli was reportedly taken by surprise as his nipa hut was raided by SAF member(s) who proceeded to shoot and kill Zulkifli after a brief exchange of fire. The commandos sent a cellphone message back to their base saying: \\"Mike 1 bingo\\", a code to be used in case Zulkifli was neutralised. An SAF officer severed one of Zulkifli's fingers and retrieved a hair sample to bring back for official DNA testing, as Zulkifli's body could not be recovered in time due to heavy fire. His corpse was quickly buried by civilians in accordance with Islamic tradition. Regional governor Mujiv Sabbihi Hataman has stated that the body could not be exhumed as that would go against Islamic burial practices. The FBI were requested to help confirm Marwan's DNA samples. The status of his death remained controversial for a while after it was reported, due to the Sulu airstrike incident in 2012, where the military incorrectly reported Zulkifli's death until August 2014. Despite claims of his demise, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) claimed that Marwan was still alive. The MNLF confirmed Zulkifli's demise in the clash and continues to state that they have not been sheltering Zulkifli. The MNLF said that based on an intelligence report they received that said Marwan is dead as a result of the encounter. MILF chairman Al-Hajj Murad Ebrahim also told that Abdul Basit Usman, who was also pursued by SAF troops was able to escape. It was reported that his last words as he attempted to fire against the SAF officers raiding his nipa hut were \\"Allahu Akbar!\\" DNA confirmation On 4 February 2015, the FBI sent a message to Philippine authorities confirming that the DNA obtained from the killed man during the PNP Special Action Force Operation Exodus was from Zulkifli. Though absolute identification was not possible in the preliminary stages of testing, the FBI has reported that the DNA samples were very likely to be Zulkifli's due to striking similarities. The FBI officially confirmed Zulkifli's death on April 1, 2015. Reactions to death from Abdhir family His family in Malaysia have said that they have no intention to claim his body, his daughter said \\"To us, our father died a long time ago, there is no need to claim the body.\\" A male relative said; \\"Our family had been informed six times, over the years, that he had been killed. I am tired of saying Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un (surely we belong to Allah and to Him shall we return). All he told us were lies after lies. We are the ones who were forced to face the predicament of his doings. More so after he was labelled as the mastermind behind the 2002 Bali Bombings.\\" adding that the only person who still saw the good in Marwan was his mother. The same male relative spoke angrily of Zulkifli's brother Rahmat and claimed that he was highly impressionable and was manipulated by Zulkifli into providing the support that he did. The relative blamed Zulkifli for ruining Rahmat's life, including for his children and wife. ==See also== * Mamasapano clash * Abu Sayyaf * Abdul Basit Usman * Azahari Husin * Jemaah Islamiyah * Khadaffy Janjalani * Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia * Umar Patek ==ReferencesFurther reading== Wanted and designation as a terrorist * US$5M bounty up for Malaysian terrorist at the ABS-CBN News * Brothers face terror-related charges at the USA Today * Specially Designated Global Terrorist and His Brother Indicted for Providing Material Support to Terrorists at the United States Department of Justice * UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

It is most often encountered along forest margins, in grasslands, along roadsides, or in moist ditches. The species is characterized by its short-stalked spathes with fused margins that usually occur in clusters of two or three, bearing flowers that barely stick out from the mouth of the spathe. The species is very similar to Commelina paludosa, and further study is needed to recognize the boundary between the two. The two are typically differentiated on the basis of C. paludosa having larger and more numerous spathes that occur in clusters of four to ten, forming a sort of head. C. paludosa is also reported to have larger leaves, a more erect habit, less branching, and thicker stems. On the other hand, C. maculata is supposed to have heads of only two to three spathes, low-growing stems, numerous branches, slender stems that root at the nodes, and leaves less than ten cm long by two and a half cm wide. ==References== maculata Category:Flora of Asia Category:Plants described in 1851 ","title":"Commelina maculata"},{"id":"35335682","text":"Shih Shih (born 29 November 1950 in Taipei, Taiwan) is a naturalized Austrian composer.

Shih's international breakthrough came with his opera ‚ÄûVatermord‚Äú (\\"Death of a Father\\"), first performed in Dresden in 1994 and followed by performances at Leipzig Oper and in Nuremberg, Erlangen, Vienna and Berlin. Further important steps include the oratorio, ‚ÄûLebend‚Äôges Land‚Äú, in M√ºnster; the music-installation, \\"Prayer\\", in Taiwan (on the occasion of the centennial of the Republic of China); and the open-ended cycle, ‚ÄûEin Takt f√ºr...‚Äú (\\"A Measure for...\\"), which established Shih's individual style of transforming psychical processes into music for all existing instruments, either in solo performance or in combination with others. == Style == The music critic Dr. Christian Baier has described Shih's intentions as the \\"search for form as well as formal scepticism, richness of expression as well as absolute restraint and austerity. His music allows the performer rich space for free interpretation\\". Shih himself explains: \\"My music is not traditional, but conscious of tradition. As a composer, I am part of a long tradition, and I have to deal with this tradition. Of course I can turn my back, say farewell to tradition and live wholly for the experiment. But in doing so, one soon becomes lonely ‚Äì not only as a human being, but also as an artist. It is necessary to be conscious of one‚Äôs cultural-historical past to arrive at an artistic, i.e. individual present.\\" == List of compositions == * 1981: Epitaph I (flute, oboe, clarinet and basson) * 1982: Dancing Song ‚Äì for flute and seven percussion instruments * 1983: Dejaviews (three Dance Pieces for Two) ‚Äì for Piano * 1983: The Night of 15.

They provide an important energy source for working muscle. During exercise, a large amount of circulating free fatty acids are directed into muscle cells for energy; during rest, incoming fatty acids are instead stored in the muscle cell as triglycerides for later burning. However, an increase in muscle insulin resistance, caused by obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, and metabolic syndrome, will result in an excess accumulation of intramyocellular lipids. Other expert opinions and researchers argue the exact opposite: that accumulation of intramyocellular lipids would, in fact, be the cause of the insulin resistance that leads to type II diabetes.Barnard, B.

His brother, Jackie Sutton, also held a Wales boxing belt and his son, George Jr, contested the British Bantamweight title. Sutton's career record was poor, and his few wins tended to coincide with the challenges he made for the Welsh titles. ==Boxing career== One of four boxing brothers, Sutton trained as an amateur at the Vale ABC. He turned professional in 1944 losing to Tommy Burney at The Stadium in Liverpool in his first professional bout. He failed to win in his next two fights, including a humiliating lost to Burmese fighter Al Hutt, when Sutton was knocked out by his opponent while he was hitching up his shorts. On 14 June 1948 he was selected to fight Billy Davies, the holder of the Wales flyweight title, at Queen's Hall, Pontypridd. The fight went the full 15 rounds, with Sutton being given the title on points decision. Sutton fought at least three more times before his first defence of his new title, all fought in England and all ending in defeat. In March 1948, Sutton was called to defend his Wales title against the extremely experienced Norman Lewis. Lewis brought with him over a hundred fights and had once challenged for the British and Commonwealth belts at bantamweight. Sutton gave a good account, but was forced to retire in the final round of the twelve round contest; losing his championship title. In July 1949 Sutton faced Glyn David, the first of four such meetings. Sutton lost on points, but then recorded a rare win, again over Billy Davies. In November 1949 Sutton again faced David, with an identical result, a points decision loss. His third fight to David was for the vacant Wales flyweight title, relinquished by Norman Lewis who had moved back to Bantamweight. The 12 round fight took place at Coney Beach Arena in Porthcawl in August 1950, and David made it a hat-trick of wins by beating Sutton on points. Sutton began 1951 with a loss to George Edwards in Middlesbrough when he was disqualified in the fourth round. He followed this with another loss, this time to future Wales bantamweight champion Hughie Thomas at Maindy Stadium in Cardiff. Despite the poor run of form Sutton was allowed another challenge for the Wales lightweight title, still held by his rival Glyn David. The match was arranged for 4 October 1950 and was held at the Cardiff Arms Park in Cardiff. Sutton and David's 12 round fight were given top billing, with Tommy Farr challenging Robert Eugene on the undercard. Sutton showed he had learnt from his past encounters with David and this time was in complete control of the fight. Sutton gave an incredible display of hitting without being hit, scoring to the body and head while keeping out of David's range. The bout went the full distance and Sutton was given the decision, regaining the Welsh lightweight title. Sutton fought a few more bouts after taking the title, but never defended it. He retired from competitive boxing in 1952, and spent some time in London as a sparring partner for the likes of South African fighter Jake Tuli. Although he spoke of going up in weight to challenge Welsh featherweight Dai Davies it never happened. He later revivied his old Vale club along with brother Jackie, and trained the next generation of fighters, including George Jr. He later moved to Fairwater area of Cardiff and died there in December 1995. ==Notes * Category:1922 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Welsh male boxers Category:Flyweight boxers Category:Boxers from Cardiff ","title":"George Sutton (boxer)"},{"id":"35336109","text":"Asheq Hesar (, also Romanized as ‚ÄòƒÄsheq ·∏®e≈üƒÅr, Asak-Gisar, Asak ·∏®e≈üƒÅr, Asak HisƒÅr, Ashegh Hesar, and ƒÄsheykh ·∏®e≈üƒÅr) is a village in Qaqazan-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Formed in 1940 and traded as on the New York Stock Exchange, it is a provider of process and process control equipment and software for microelectronic manufacturing industries (primarily semiconductor). The company's product offering includes automated defect inspection and metrology systems, probe card test and analysis systems, and lithography step-and-repeat systems. In addition, Rudolph provides a broad range of software products designed to improve yield, control processes and reduce manufacturing costs. On October 25, 2019, Rudolph merged with Nanometrics Incorporated to become Onto Innovation, trading as . ==History== Rudolph Research: 1940-1995 Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (RTI) traces its origins to 1940, when Otto Curt Rudolph formed O.C. Rudolph & Sons, Inc. Originally an importer of microscopes and scientific instruments, this RTI predecessor was renamed in October 1970 to Rudolph Research Corporation. The company designed optical equipment for laboratories and universities. The company Otto Rudolph established continued to evolve, making breakthroughs in ellipsometry including the first production-oriented ellipsometer for thin, transparent film measurements. The company continued development of its metrology products, securing new patents along the way. Formation of Rudolph Technologies: 1996-1999 In June 1996, Richard Spanier, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Rudolph Research, forged a partnership agreement with Boston-based Riverside PartnersRiverside Partners and New York-based Liberty Partners Liberty Partners who, along with others, invested in the company. At that time, Dr. Spanier retired his active role in the company and semiconductor industry veteran Paul F. McLaughlin was named as CEO. In August 1999, the name of the company was changed to Rudolph Technologies, Inc. In November 1999, RTI made its initial public offering of common stock. Revenues grew dramatically, reaching a record $38.1 million. A new facility opened early in the year, and the company launched a new product, the MetaPULSE¬Æ line of copper film measurement tools. Rudolph Technologies: 2000-present In July 2002, RTI agreed to acquire the Richardson, Texas-based defect control company ISOA, Inc. A spin-off from Texas Tech University's International Center for Informatics Research, ISOA had been licensing technology to the semiconductor industry for about 16 years, offering defect detection software. The deal was completed in September, with ISOA becoming RTI's Yield Metrology Group. Several months later, RTI expanded into China by establishing an office in Shanghai's Pudong industrial area. In subsequent years, the company established additional offices in all semiconductor manufacturing regions of the world including Japan, Europe, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. In 2006, a merger was completed with Minnesota-based August Technology Corporation, growing Rudolph's workforce to 550 employees. This acquisition brought Rudolph into the ‚Äòback-end‚Äô of the manufacturing process. In 2007, the company acquired the semiconductor business of Washington-based Applied Precision LLC, adding probe card test and analysis to the company's portfolio. The acquisition of RVSI Inspection LLC and its Wafer Scanner inspection system was announced in 2008. Adventa Control Technologies, Inc., a provider of process control software, was acquired in 2009, and an acquisition of MKS Instruments, Inc.‚Äôs Yield Dynamics business was completed in 2010. Rudolph announced two acquisitions in 2012. NanoPhotonics GmbH, Mainz, Germany (unpatterned wafer inspection); and Azores Corp., Wilmington, MA (Rudolph's entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets). In 2013 Rudolph announced the acquisition of selected assets of Tamar Technology, Newbury Park, CA, a supplier of 3D metrology technologies. Rudolph acquired the inspection technology of Stella Alliance in 2015, adding patents to enhance its inspection capability. In November 2015, Rudolph announced the retirement of Paul F.

In January 2017, Voce Capital Management LLC in a letter to investors, urged merging semiconductor-equipment makers Rudolph Technologies Inc. and Nanometrics Inc. The merger eventually occurred and closed on October 30, 2019. According to the Joint Proxy Statement announcing the terms of the merger, talks began in the first quarter of 2016 and continuing into 2017, Nanometrics and Rudolph engaged in discussions concerning a potential business combination between the two companies, to be structured as a merger of equals transaction, which discussions between the parties are referred to as the 2017 discussions. In connection with the 2017 discussions, in February 2016, Nanometrics and Rudolph entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement, which was subsequently extended in January 2017. The company is now headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, with additional U.S. operations in New Jersey, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Texas, and Washington. Manufacturing operations for inspection and metrology products are consolidated in Minnesota; stepper manufacturing is located in Wilmington, Massachusetts. ==Products and services== Semiconductor fabrication, packaging and testing Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to create the integrated circuits that are found in commonly used electronic devices and electrical equipment. It is a multiple-step process during which electronic circuits are gradually built by adding elements and layers of material on a substrate made of pure silicon, or various compounds in the case of specialized applications, hundreds of steps performed by specialized process tools are required before the wafer moves to a final packaging facility. The focus of packaging and assembly is to ensure an electrical connection from the die to the circuit board, to encapsulate the package for mechanical integrity and to withstand thermal variations. The era of slim form-factor devices, such as smart phones, implies high level of functionality in very dense footprint. Due to these requirements, the challenges in packaging, assembly and test have significantly increased and advanced packaging techniques such as bumping or through-silicon via are necessary. ==References *www.rudolphtech.com Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Equipment semiconductor companies Category:Technology companies established in 1940 Category:1940 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Onto Innovation"},{"id":"35336608","text":"Fagin is a major character in the Dickens novel Oliver Twist.

He was previously Inspector General of the Norwegian Army and Chief of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). ==Personal life== Born in the small coastal town of Krager√∏, Norway, Robert Mood hails from a family which immigrated from Sweden in the 19th century, adding the second \\"o\\" to the family name (mod means courage in Swedish). He grew up with two sisters, one older and one younger. His family was always involved in nature activities, such as sailing, hunting, mountain hiking, and he has stated a wish of being able to live on an old sailboat, immersing himself in that lifestyle, after he retires. Mood graduated in Bergen. Mood has a son. Robert Mood is said to possess resolve as well as diplomatic skills unusual for a high-ranking military officer, and also a laconic wit. His military career has come about more by accident than by any persistent decision. In his late teens when adults were advising him to enter the non-commissioned officers' school, he did. Once inside the military, one year simply succeeded another. He does not consider himself a Christian, perceiving himself more in the Humanist tradition: \\"I believe in something which is bigger than humans, but what that is I find difficult to define.\\" In an interview with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK Mood compared opera to his own work; \\"A good opera is all about combining very different elements into a piece that eventually becomes very impressive.\\" ==Military career== Training * Infantry non-commissioned officers school (1978) * Norwegian Military Academy (1983) * Army Staff School (1990) * Army Staff School II (1993) * NATO Defense College * United States Marine Corps University (Masters of military studies) * USMC School of Advanced Warfighting Commands Robert Mood's military career began in 1977. In the Brigade in Northern Norway he ascended orderly as squad leader, platoon and company leader. He was operations officer with the Norwegian Battalion in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) during the Lebanese Civil War which ended in 1990. Mood was lieutenant commander at Telemark Battalion 1993-94. He was promoted lieutenant colonel in 1996. Following training from the US Marine Corps he acted as operations officer for the 6th Division until 1998. He then became head of Telemark Battalion, which was deployed in Kosovo from 1999 through 2000. He held this position for two years, as his predecessor Jon B. Lilland had done. He was promoted to colonel in 2000 when he was appointed as Chief of Planning Branch of the Norwegian High Command. In 2002 he was promoted to brigadier and was appointed as chief of H√¶rens kampv√•pen. In 2004 came his appointment to chief position in the Army Transformation and Doctrine Command (TRADOK). After the financial scandal in the army in 2005 and the departure of Lars S√∏lvberg, Mood became Inspector General of the Army. Robert Mood has limited conventional warfighting experience. In January 2009 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed major general Mood for a new chief of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).Major General Robert Mood Appointed Head of Mission, Chief of Staff of United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), Secretary-General, SG/A/1172, BIO/4058, PKO/203. Department of Public Information, News and Media Division, New York. Serving as Head of Mission and Force Commander at Assistant Secretary General level in the UN, he was UNTSO chief until February 2011, holding offices in Beirut, Damascus, Cairo and Jerusalem (also covering Amman). On 1 August 2011 he became the first director and veteran inspector of Defence Veteran Services (FVT), a temporary project, under the academic supervision of Head of Defence Staff/P. FVT has been commissioned to implement improvements and fill the role as advisor and spokesperson for veteran affairs to the Chief of Defence of Norway. In January 2014 Mood was appointed Lieutenant General and chief of the Military Mission in Brussels. UN commission in the Syria conflict In April 2012 Mood was commissioned to assist Kofi Annan in Annan's work as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the Arab League in Syria in connection with the conflict there.Nordmann blir Kofi Annans h√∏yre h√•nd i Syria, VG Nett, 4 April 2012.Mood om situasjonen i Syria, NRK, 20. juni 2012. The Kofi Annan peace plan for Syria was worked out from 5 to 8 April with the negotiations being carried around the clock under Mood's leadership. The greatest challenge was that Syria insisted on maintaining its sovereignty. According to Mood, \\"Syria insists on the right to use military means also against its own population when they find that necessary.\\" Mood's good relations with the Syrian military has been seen as a threat by the Syrian government, according to the state-owned Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The ceasefire went into effect on 12 April. Following 21 April decision by the UN Security Council to dispatch 300 military ceasefire observers to Syria under UN auspices‚Äîthe United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS)‚ÄîRobert Mood was tipped as a possible, even likely, candidate for the Force Commander position (Special Representative of the Secretary-General ‚Äì SRSG). On 25 April news emerged that he would get the appointment, and the selection was announced on 27 April. In the weeks before the appointment questions had arisen about the process that led to Mood's selection. Mood was present at a meeting in the Security Council on 23 April, but neither the UN Secretary General's deputy spokesman nor the US ambassador would give details on his status vis-√†-vis the UN. Mood himself also refused to answer media questions about his presence at the SC meeting wearing military uniform. Information about who was paying for his travel activities also remained unanswered. Earlier in the process Mood's candidacy had been opposed by Russia. On 10 April Mood left Damascus for Geneva, and Russia's UN ambassador strongly criticized his leaving Syria at a critical juncture, insinuating this was unprofessional conduct. Russia in the end did approve his appointment. UNSMIS established itself in three weeks as a full mission with presence from Deraa in the South to Aleppo in the north and later Deir E Zoor in the East and opened dialogue with rebels and officials at local level as well as in Damascus with Government officials. In mid June the violence had increased again to a level that according to Mood made it impossible for UNSMIS to carry out its mandated tasks and operations were frozen. The UN Security Council decided in July not to extend the mandate of UNSMIS beyond a final 30 days and Mood left Syria. He has expressed a personal infatuation with both Damascus and Syria where he has spent much time during his 2009‚Äì2011 leadership of UNTSO, accompanied by his family. Decorations Mood has been awarded the following decorations:¬´D√∏ren er √•pnet¬ª, Forsvaret.no, 24 August 2011.

After leaving his position as a video game developer and designer at Activision, Garry Kitchen founded the company in 1986 with his brother Dan Kitchen, along with David Crane, Alex DeMeo, John Van Ryzin.Absolute Entertainment at the Videogame Music Preservation Foundation Wiki The company's headquarters was in Glen Rock, New Jersey, but later moved to another New Jersey borough, Upper Saddle River. While the company was based in New Jersey, David Crane worked out of his home on the West Coast.http://video-game-ephemera.com/010.htm The company's name was chosen because it was alphabetically above Activision, implying that Absolute Entertainment was superior to Activision. It was the same strategy that Activision chose when the programmers left Atari. At Absolute Entertainment, Kitchen continued developing games for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, as he had done at Activision. However, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) had already displaced Atari's dominance of the video game console market. Kitchen swiftly shifted his focus to the NES, and produced several landmark titles for the platform, beginning with A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia in 1989, and Battle Tank in 1990. Absolute Entertainment absorbed its studio Imagineering in 1992 to become itself a video game developer for the first time. In the third quarter of 1995, Absolute Entertainment went bankrupt and suspended operations and laid off most of its staff. Since Kitchen had already formed a new company with David Crane called Skyworks Technologies, some of the employees transitioned to the new company. ==References== Category:Companies based in Bergen County, New Jersey Category:Video game companies established in 1986 Category:Video game companies disestablished in 1995 Category:Defunct companies based in New Jersey Category:Video game publishers Category:Defunct video game companies of the United States Category:1986 establishments in New Jersey Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1995 ","title":"Absolute Entertainment"},{"id":"35336685","text":"David Meir Frisch (c. 1812-April 25, 1882)Ivri Anochi periodical, Issue #31, Iyyar 16, 5642 (April 25, 1882) (Funeral notice). was a 19th-century rabbinical authority. ==Early life and lineage== Rabbi David Meir Frisch (◊ì◊ï◊ì ◊û◊ê◊ô◊® ◊§◊®◊ô◊©) (Dawid Majer Frisch, David Mayer Frisch) was born around 1812Rabbi Moshe Leiter's estimation. See References. in the town of Rohatyn, in western Ukraine, a part of Austria-Hungary at the time. The region was known as Galicia. Nothing is known of his early years. Neither is the date of his appointment as Rabbi of Berezhany knownAlthough it is likely after 1840, the date of the Letter of Ordination by Rabbi Shlomo Kluger wherein he is referred to as being from Rohatyn, rather than Berezhany. An essayHaPeles (Hebrew periodical), 5667 (1907), #25, 46ff. by Rabbi Joseph LewinsteinOholei Shem, p. 365 titled \\"My Kin the \\"Pene Yehoshua\\" (Yaakov Yehoshua ben Tzvi Hirsch),E.J., 11, 175. traces Rabbi David Meir's lineage to the \\"Pene Yehoshua\\".\\"my kin, the Gaon Rabbi Baruch Meir Frisch (see note#38) head of the rabbinical court of Czortkow, son of the Gaon Rabbi Avigdor Zvi Hirsch Frisch, of Blessed Memory, wrote to me in behalf of his uncle, the Gaon Rabbi David Meir Frisch, head of the rabbinical court of Berzan (Berezhany), author of the Yad Meir, (of his lineage from the Pene Yehoshua), the son of Yehoshua, the son of Baruch, the son of Zvi Hirsch, the son of Samuel, the son of Arye Lev (the latter) the son of the Gaon the Pene Yehoshua (Yaakov Yehoshua ben Tzvi Hirsch)\\". This makes him the sixth generation descendant of the author of the classic Talmudic commentary \\"Pene Yehoshua (Yaakov Yehoshua ben Tzvi Hirsch)\\" (1680‚Äì1756). The maternal fourth generation ancestor of the \\"Pene Yehoshua\\", (Joshua H√∂schel ben Joseph) (1578‚Äì1648), himself was the author of a classical commentary on Rashi, the \\"Meginnei Shelomo\\" (Amsterdam, 1715), and a collection of responsa, also titled \\"(Sheeilot uTeshuvot) Pene Yehoshua\\" (Amsterdam, 1715). ==Letter of rabbinical ordination== A copy of his rabbinical ordination letter (Hormana) (◊î◊ï◊®◊û◊†◊ê) from Rabbi Shlomo Kluger (1785‚Äì1869) is preserved in the opening pages of his only surviving printed work, the Responsa \\"Yad Meir\\", (◊©◊ï\\"◊™ ◊ô◊ì ◊û◊ê◊ô◊®) printed in Lemberg in 1881. This letter, dated in 1840 in Brody, speaks of Rabbi Frisch in laudatory phrases, attests that he engaged him in Halachic arguments on several occasions and although \\"I vowed not to issue (letters of ordination) to any one, my vow didn't envisage a person of his stature\\". ==Literary correspondence== Rabbi Frisch addressed queries to many of the rabbinical luminaries of his time, dealing with questions of law, covering all four parts of the Shulchan Aruch, including ritual, marital, monetary and civil matters. To the extent that responsa answering these queries were printed, they appear in the collections of the following luminaries: Rabbi Shlomo Kluger -approx. 20 responsa Rabbi Mordechai Zeev EttingerE.J., 6,953. (1804‚Äì1863) - 2 responsa Rabbi Shlomo DriemerWunder, 1, 833. (1800*-1873) - 2 responsa Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathansohn (1808‚Äì1875) - 11 responsa Rabbi Isaac Aron EttingaWunder, 1, 124.

(1839‚Äì1902) - 1 responsum Rabbi Abraham TeomimWunder, 5, 645 (1814‚Äì1868) - 1 responsum. In addition to his responsa in the Yad Meir, two more responsa have been printed in the works of other authors. Two manuscript responsa were published in recent years in two Talmudic journals. Part of this material was printed in softcover in 2005 on the occasion of the marriage of a great-great-granddaughterKunteres Yad Meir, 12 Adar II, 2005, Brooklyn, NY. (private printing) in Brooklyn, New York. While the above appears to comprise virtually all that is known of his output, the author in the Foreword of the Yad Meir alludes to \\"many works\\" completed by him, going back to the years of his youth, encompassing the entire Babylonian Talmud, another work on the Shulchan Aruch, the Halachot of Niddah, similar in format to the classic \\"Simlah Chadashah\\" and the related commentary \\"Tevuot Shor\\" of Rabbi Alexander Sender SchorE. J., 14, 995. (d. 1737), \\"a large work\\"; in addition to a work on Avoth and on the Torah. \\"I answered many questioners and I give priority to publish [herein] a few of my responsa so that they shall not be forgotten\\"It is likely that these works existed in manuscript form until the Holocaust, in Berezhany. The late Shelly (Shaindel Frisch) Lewkowitz of Tel Aviv (a great-granddaughter of the Yad Meir, who resided in Berezhany until before the Holocaust) related that the daughter-in- law of the Yad Meir, Channah Frisch (widow of Baruch Frisch) maintained manuscripts under lock and key in the Frisch home (at Slowacky 20) in Berezhany, into the late thirties. At the end of Foreword he alludes that he did not have the means to publish his works and only now, at the prompting of his Rebbetzin, Shaindel, did he print selected responsa \\"now that our offspring are married off\\". The Foreword is dated June 17, 1881. Rabbi David Meir Frisch died ten months later. ==Words of Torah quoted in Divrei Shaul== In a recent editionJerusalem, 2007. First printed in Lemberg, 1875-1877. of \\"Divrei Shaul\\" of Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathansohn (the \\"Shaul uMeishiv\\", as he is known in Talmudic literature), the index cites four instances of quotes from Rabbi David Meir Frisch, \\"Dayan of Berezhany\\".II 245;255.

Van Straalen, 1894, the large online database http://hebrewbooks.org/523, and others. ==Later years== Two young talmudic scholars of rabbinic provenance, Yechiel Mechal Leiter and Yaakov Geller, who studied together, decided to address their Talmudic/Halachic queries to a number of the rabbinical luminaries of their time, and published the responsa received in Lemberg in 1886, under the title ‚ÄúMazkeret Ahavah‚Äù . It includes a short responsum from Rabbi David Meir Frisch, z‚Äùtzl.. It is undated. It states that ‚ÄúI received your letter yesterday, but I am bereft of strength and most of the day I am bedridden and the little I do move around in my home, it is hard for me to read‚Ä¶though I usually only respond to practical Halachic questions, but to such lovers and learners of Torah I shall answer two or three of your initial queries, but I cannot read more‚Ä¶‚Äù It appears from the above that Rabbi Frisch had been ill for some time prior to his passing. ==NotesReferences== *Lewinstein, Rabbi Joseph ‚ÄúMy Kin the Pene Yehoshua‚Äù, HaPeles, 5667 (1907), #25, 46ff.

Rolling Stone called him \\"the most hated man on the Internet.\\" His (now defunct) revenge porn website Is Anyone Up? allowed users to post sexual and explicit photos of people online without their consent, often accompanied by personal information such as their name and address. He refused to take down pictures on request. Moore called himself \\"a professional life ruiner\\" and compared himself to Charles Manson. The website was up for 16 months, during which Moore stated several times he was protected by the same laws that protect Facebook. Moore also paid a hacker to break into email accounts of victims and steal private photos to post. The FBI started an investigation on Moore in 2012 after receiving evidence from the mother of one of the victims. The site was closed in April 2012 and sold to an anti-bullying group. In February 2015, Moore pleaded guilty to felony charges for aggravated identity theft and aiding and abetting in the unauthorized access of a computer. In December 2015, Moore was sentenced to two years and six months in prison, a $2,000 fine, and $145.70 in restitution. ==Is Anyone Up?== Moore started the website in 2010. It featured revealing photos and videos of people who were not professional models, linked to their social networking profiles on Facebook or Twitter. Many of the subjects were outraged by inclusion on the site, claiming the explicit photos had been hacked from their personal computers or shared with former boyfriends or girlfriends, and that the photos had been posted as a form of revenge. Because of this, the site's content became known as \\"revenge porn.\\" Moore reportedly responded to multiple cease- and-desist letters with simply \\"LOL‚Äù and would regularly argue that the law protected his activities. Moore claimed that the website attracted 30 million page views monthly as well as yielding $8,000 to $13,000 a month in ad revenue. In response to public bragging by Moore about the website, BBC named Moore \\"the Net's most hated man\\" and Rolling Stone called him \\"the most hated man on the Internet.\\" Moore eventually faced numerous lawsuits and an FBI investigation. He was also stabbed in the shoulder with a pen by a woman who had been featured on the site. On April 19, 2012, Moore sold the website to an anti-bullying group. He posted an open letter explaining his decision. ==FBI investigation== Charlotte Laws, the mother of one of the victims on the site, decided to track Moore down and conducted a two-year investigation where she compiled evidence from more than 40 victims and gave it to the FBI. In 2012, Moore and a colleague hacker named Charles Evens (who went under the alias of \\"Gary Jones\\") were suspected of hacking-related crimes. The Wire stated that \\"on multiple occasions, [Moore] paid Evens to break into the email accounts of victims and steal nude photos to post on the website isanyoneup.com.\\" When it became apparent to Moore that news about his FBI investigation was beginning to surface to the public, Moore responded with \\"I will literally fucking buy a first-class fucking plane ticket right now, eat an amazing meal, buy a gun in New York, and fucking kill whoever [talked about my FBI investigation]. I'm that pissed over it. I'm actually mad right now.\\" Moore also threatened to burn down The Village Voice headquarters if they ran a story about his FBI investigation. They nevertheless ran the story. ==Indictment== On January 23, 2014, Moore was indicted in a federal court in California following an arrest by the FBI on charges of conspiracy, unauthorized access to a protected computer, and aggravated identity theft. Many of these crimes were committed in an effort to obtain nude images of people against their will. Moore was released two days later from Sacramento County Jail on a $100,000 bond. He is allowed no access to the Internet and is required by law to dismantle the archives he owns for the Is Anyone Up? database while the FBI monitors him doing so.Ian McDonald: King of Revenge Porn‚Äô Released to Parents, Now Grounded with No Internet, Fox 40, January 25, 2014/ On January 24, 2015, exactly one year since Moore had last tweeted, tweets began to appear on his account making it seem like he had returned to the internet. Moore's mother revealed that his account was either taken over or hacked and he had nothing to do with the tweets. Guilty plea On February 18, 2015, Moore entered a guilty plea with the Central District of California U.S. Attorney's Office, in which he admitted to aiding and abetting hacking, and aggravated identity theft. Under the plea, he would serve a minimum of two years in prison, and a maximum of seven years and a $500,000 fine. Conviction In February 2015, Moore plead guilty to aggravated identity theft and aiding and abetting in the unauthorized access of a computer. In addition to his mandatory prison sentence, Moore also agreed to a three-year period of supervised probation, a $2,000 fine and $145.70 in restitution. He also received an order that he delete all the data on his seized computers. Moore was sentenced to 2 ¬Ω years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release.Abby Ohlheiser, Washington Post, December 3, 2015 \\"Revenge porn purveyor Hunter Moore is sentenced to prison\\" On July 2, 2015, Charles Evens pleaded guilty to charges of computer hacking and identity theft, confessing to stealing hundreds of images from women's email accounts and selling them to Moore. He faces up to seven years in a federal prison and was sentenced on November 16, 2015. Moore was sentenced in September. By May 2017, Moore was out of prison. ==Defamation judgment== On March 8, 2013, Bullyville founder James McGibney won a $250,000 defamation judgment against Moore, after Moore reportedly called McGibney a \\"pedophile\\" and threatened to rape his wife.https://web.archive.org/web/20130327030040/http://bv.1110.cds.contentcolo.net/uploads/files/Executed%20Moore%20Judgement.pdf ==Personal life== Moore reportedly attended Woodland High School where he dropped out at a young age. Because of his controversy, the administrators of Facebook deleted any and all accounts that they suspect Hunter Moore has created on the website. ==References * Category:American Internet celebrities Category:American DJs Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sacramento, California Category:Criminals from California ","title":"Hunter Moore"},{"id":"35336858","text":"Qasemabad (, also Romanized as QƒÅsemƒÅbƒÅd; also known as Kasiabad, Yang-Kalekh, Yang Qal‚Äòeh, and Yengƒ´ Qal‚Äòeh) is a village in Qaqazan-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

His father, Ming-Tso Chen, had passed the juren level of the Chinese Imperial Civil Service Examinations. However, at the age of twelve, Chen's parents and grandmother died due to illness. Distraught, he ran away to Singapore, enduring a becalmed sailing ship journey in the South China Sea. Living with relatives in Singapore, he learned English at secondary school. He subsequently received his bachelor's degree from the National Central University in Nanjing, China. == Public Service ==  The Start of Public Service  In 1933, after being a professor of Law at the National Henan University, Chen became the assistant dean at the Shanghai Police Training School. In the next year, he became a counselor in the Military Affairs Commission.  The Burma Road  At the outbreak of the Second Sino- Japanese War in 1937, he was appointed the Director of the South-West Transportation Administration in Singapore. This led to becoming the Director of the China-Burma Transportation Administration based in Yangon. In both positions, he was charged with the supervision of the construction and operation of the 717 mile (1,154 km.) Yunnan-Burma Road (known as the Burma Road), through which China received the bulk of supplies in its fight against the Japanese during World War II until 1942. All ports on the coast of China had been taken by the Japanese, so the Burma Road was the only over-land route available to China.  Diplomatic career  At the start of the 1940s, Chen was made concurrently the Representative of China in Burma and Chief Representative of China in the China Defense Supplies at the China-Burma-India Theater in Calcutta. From 1943 through the end of World War II in 1946, he was the main representative of China in India. During that time, he played important roles in the safe conduct of President Chiang Kai-shek's oldest son, Chiang Ching-Kuo, and his family returning to China from Russia, and Chao En- Lai, returning from Paris. In 1946, Chen became the Extraordinary Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Chinese Legation to the newly independent Philippine Republic. He worked assiduously and successfully with Presidents Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, and Ramon Magsaysay on the peaceful and equitable absorption of the economically successful overseas Chinese population in the newly created Republic of the Philippines. On April 18, 1947, he signed the Treaty of Amity. In 1949, in an effort to support the shaky stature of the recently resigned Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, Chen and President Quirino arranged for a Summit in the Philippines to be called the \\"Baguio Conference\\".Deterrence and Strategic Culture: Chinese-American Confrontations, 1949-1958, Shu Guang Zhang, p. 65 Philippines Official Gazette, Message of President Quirino, July 15, 1949 https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/07/15/message-of-president-quirino- july-15-1949/ This is when both Presidents called for an Asian alliance to counter the emergence and spreading of Communist governments in the region.

In 1949, the Chinese mission to the Philippines was upgraded to an embassy, making Chen the first Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines. During his tenure, Chen became the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. He and his wife, Lilleo, became close friends with American Ambassador Admiral Raymond Spruance, hero of Midway, and then-Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, the Vatican Papal Nuncio, who was to become Nuncio to the United States and Chamberlain of the College of Cardinals. He organized overseas Chinese in the Philippines to support the suppression of the Huks. In 1954, upon his resignation and on the same day as his departure from Manila, Chen dedicated an embassy chancery donated by a grateful Chinese-Filipino community on Rojas (formerly Dewey) Boulevard. After a short period as Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chen was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Iraq, then an emerging Western-backed power in the Middle East upon the creation of the Baghdad Pact. He presented his credentials to King Feisal II in August, 1956. One year later, in October, 1957, he arranged for the Crown Prince, 'Abd al-Ilah, to visit Taiwan and Hong Kong. Many plans were in process to send Chinese technicians to help the development of Iraq when the King and Crown Prince were killed in a revolution led by Colonel Abd al-Karim Qasim on July 14, 1958. After meeting with the Colonel, Chen decided to break relations with Iraq, and flew the entire embassy staff with their families out of Baghdad on a chartered commercial plane. In 1956, while on vacation in Amman, Jordan, Chen met with King Hussein of Jordan and proposed a formal relationship between the Republic of China and Jordan. Relations were formally established in 1957. After breaking relations with the Iraqi Revolutionary Council in July, 1958, Chen immediately flew to Amman to lend support to King Hussein. The King was grateful, and maintained a close relationship, meeting practically every day, during Chen's tenure as ambassador. In March, 1959, he accompanied King Hussein on his official visit to Taiwan, and received the Special Grand Cordon of Propitious Cloudshttp://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=171790&CtNode;=124&htx;_TRCategory=‚àì=4Hussein of JordanList of orders, decorations and medals of the Republic of China Chen also made sure that China was one of the first nations to recognize the Arab FederationArab FederationSanta Cruz Sentinel, Feb. 18, 1958, p. 12 of the countries ruled by the two Hashemite first cousins, Feisal II of Iraq and Hussein of Jordan. In October, 1959, Chen was sent to begin relations with the Kingdom of Libya. He presented his credentials to King Idris at his palace in Tobruk, but established the permanent Embassy in Tripoli. Chen was instrumental in convincing the Republic of China to use technical aid as part of its foreign relations. It was a way for the Nationalist Chinese government, locked in a major global diplomatic battle to remain recognized as the legal government of all of China, to extend its relevance during a period of time of limited resources. By the time of his transfer to Mexico, there were Chinese technicians and advisors in the Ministry of Communications, Agriculture, and Health. Notably, Chinese agricultural experts showed Libyan authorities that high-yielding rice crops could be cultivated in the Sahara Desert. In 1965, Ambassador Chen was sent as a Chief Delegate for the Republic of China to the 20th. Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This was the first in seven consecutive General Assemblies that he attended in the same role. In 1965, Chen was transferred to Mexico. Until 1971, he made a point to visit every area in the country that had a Chinese immigrant family, and to reunite Mexicans of Chinese heritage with their historic culture. On his many official visits to towns and provinces, he was given numerous welcoming citations such as Honored Guest (\\"Huesped Distinguido\\") and keys to cities. He became Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, worked on the constant issue of Chinese immigration, arranged cultural exchanges, and expedited the participation of the Republic of China in the XIX Olympiad in Mexico. In the late 1960s, he was also one of the main contacts in the exploration of the \\"Russia Option\\", to create relations between Taiwan and the USSR.Paul H. Tai. \\"The Russia Option\\", Hoover Digest, July 2, 2010 While Ambassador Chen was in Taipei in consultations with the Foreign Ministry and President Chiang in November, 1971, the Mexican government announced the unilateral cutting of its 60 years of diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, and recognition of the People's Republic of China. Thereafter, while still holding the positions of National Security Advisor to President Chiang, Advisor to the Foreign Ministry, and member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, Chen resided mostly in Berkeley, California. He suffered a severe stroke and died in February 1984. == Personal life == Chen Chih-Ping had three sons in a first marriage to Amy Tsing Ziang Liu: David (Shih-Biau), Thomas (Shih-Nien), and Peter (Shih-Yuh). He subsequently married Lilleo Yung-Chieh Wong, the oldest daughter of Wong Ah Shein, an overseas Chinese businessman in Burma. They remained married until the end of both of their lives, producing three sons: Michael (Shih-ta), Shih-Hsiung, and Joe (Shih-Tso). ==Published works== The Arabs Yesterday and Today, 1968, National War College in cooperation with the Committee on The Compilation of The Chinese Library, Taiwan, Republic of China. A work that traced the origins and development of the Arab world through the mid-Twentieth Century, and a compendium of geographical, historical, and economic facts of all Arab countries as of 1968. Professor Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali, former Prime Minister of Iraq, wrote in his Introduction to the book, \\"Ambassador Chen has made a great contribution to international understanding by writing this excellent book on 'The Arabs Yesterday and Today\\". It is most interesting and instructive to see the Arabs through Chinese eyes. And the Arabs could hardly find a better Chinese friend than Ambassador Chen to write about their history, past and present.\\" == References == *Republic of China Yearbook, 1968, China Publishing, Taipei, Taiwan *Philippine Treaties Online: https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032337/http://dfa.gov.ph/treaties/ola/index.php/list- of-articles/982-treaty-of-amity-between-the-republic-of-the-philippines-and- the-republic-of-china-signed-at-manila-april-18-1947 *http://astheysawit.info/7010-1959-jordan.html *The Arabs Yesterday and Today, 1968, National War College in cooperation with the Committee on The Compilation of The Chinese Library, Taiwan, Republic of China. http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/2135027 *Deterrence and Strategic Culture: Chinese-American Confrontations, 1949‚Äì1958, Shu Guang Zhang, p. 65 *U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1949, Volume VII, Part 2, The Far East and Australasia, Document 329 *U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1949, Volume VII, Part 2, The Far East and Australasia, Document 335 *U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1949, Volume VII, Part 2, The Far East and Australasia, Document 328 Category:1906 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the Republic of China to the Philippines Category:Ambassadors of China to Jordan Category:Burma in World War II Category:Military history of China during World War II Category:China and the United Nations Category:Kuomintang politicians in Taiwan Category:Republic of China politicians from Hainan Category:Chinese police officers Category:People from Wenchang Category:Taiwanese people from Hainan ","title":"Chih-Ping Chen"},{"id":"35336906","text":"Qazan Daghi (, also Romanized as QƒÅzƒÅn DƒÅghƒ´; also known as QƒÅrƒÅn DƒÅghƒ´) is a village in Qaqazan-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The company eventually complied, and the Union acquired 25,000 of the single-action revolvers for $12 each (). However, the price paid by the government for the DA army revolver was $25. The State of Ohio purchased 500 of the .36 Caliber Navy version for $20 each. Starr DA revolver 1858 Starr 1863 .44 Single Action Revolver == Power and charge == The Starr DA .44 cylinder holds in each chamber of powder, the bullet weighs . == Three variations == Starr received patent number 30843 on December 4, 1860 for the DA revolver. Starr patent: File:001_starr1860patent.jpg File:002_starr1860patent.jpg File:003_starr1860patent.jpg File:004_starr1860patent.jpg Generally there are three models of Starr revolvers: 1858 Double Action .36 Caliber Percussion Navy Revolver (produced 1859-1860) [3000 produced] 1858 Double Action .44 Caliber Percussion Army Revolver (produced 1862-1863) [~23000 produced] 1863 Single Action .44 Caliber Percussion Army Revolver (produced 1863-1864) [23000 produced] In total, 47,454 Starr revolvers were manufactured making it the third most issued of civil war era revolvers (6,352 Starr DA Navy and Army revolvers were purchased on the open market). == Other double-action percussion revolvers == The most widely known double-action percussion revolver is likely the First Model Adams of 1851. This was unique in having a double-action-only mechanism, a cylinder that could quickly be removed by pulling forward on the front of the cylinder pin and slightly tapered cylinders designed to take either proprietary combustible cartridges with a conical bullet designed to fit the tapered cylinder or a round ball. No ramrod was provided. Another unique feature was a safety catch which held the hammer away from the percussion cap under it so it could be carried with all its 5 cylinders loaded unlike the Colt in which one of its 6 cylinders was left uncapped while carried because the hammer would rest on it which could result in a discharge if dropped. An improved version of this is the Beaumont‚ÄìAdams of 1855 which has a hammer spur and a mechanism which allows single-or double- action operation. The cartridge idea had proved unpopular, so the cylinders were bored parallel for use with ball and powder and a ramrod installed on the left side of the barrel. The Beaumont‚ÄìAdams differs from the Starr DA in that it is configured for a SA/DA mode. Some sources claim that Starr and Beaumont did not produce enough revolvers to be considered major players in the market. These sources claim that the first widely used DA revolver (sometimes called the first \\"modern\\" revolver) was the Colt 1889 .38 Government (.38 Long Colt) used by the Navy, and/or the improved version for the Navy and Army, the Colt 1892, because, despite wide adoption, the 1889 model was produced in relatively low numbers. == Pietta replica == For a time, the Pietta company manufactured a modern-day replica of the Starr double-action and single-action models. Aficionados generally consider the replica to be of lower overall quality than the original. == Cultural reference == The Starr DA is featured in the 1992 film Unforgiven, when William Munny (Clint Eastwood) takes it from its case to determine whether he has lost his former shooting ability. The self-cocking trigger can be seen in this film. In the 1994 film Wyatt Earp young Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) carries this gun. This gun is shown in its case in the 1982 film First Blood. ==References *Compare between original and replica revolvers Category:Early revolvers Category:Eban Starr design Category:American Civil War weapons Category:Guns of the American West ","title":"Starr revolver"},{"id":"35337109","text":"Robert Glen \\"Bobby\\" Doyle (August 14, 1939 ‚Äì July 30, 2006) was an American singer, bassist, and pianist. He is best known for his early work with a young Kenny Rogers and for a brief stint with Blood, Sweat & Tears. He played piano on two tracks on BS&T;'s 1972 album New Blood. Doyle joined the doo-wop group The Spades (later The Slades) in 1957 while still at McCallum High School in Austin. In 1960 he formed The Bobby Doyle Three with Don Russell and standup bass player Kenny Rogers, then a student at the University of Texas. Rogers soon dropped out of college to join Doyle full-time, singing high harmony and playing bass on the 1962 album In A Most Unusual Way. The group appeared at clubs across the country including the New York Playboy Club in 1962. The trio disbanded in 1965, and Rogers went on to become a country-pop sensation. Doyle continued as a solo artist, releasing multiple singles and albums including an appearance on the soundtrack for the 1971 film Vanishing Point. In the 1980s, Doyle on piano, Rick Moses on bass and William Walton on drums, backed Brunswick recording artist Sunny Nash. In the mid-1990s, Rogers (now a long established superstar) reunited with Doyle and Russell as part of a special concert called \\"Going Home\\" where Rogers sang a selection of his greatest hits and favorite songs. The original Bobby Doyle Trio line-up performed \\"It's A Good Day\\" with Doyle on lead vocals. Doyle was born blind as a result of his mother contracting German measles during pregnancy. An operation in 1959 to restore his sight, paid for by his high school friends, was unsuccessful. == Discography == SinglesLabel scans available at www.45cat.com The Spades (Don Windell Burch, John Goeke, Tommy Kaspar, Bobby Doyle (bass), Joyce Webb) *Domino Records, Austin, Texas, 1957 ::OR200/OR100: \\"Baby\\"/\\"You Mean Everything To Me\\" *Liberty Records, Hollywood, California, December 23, 1957 :: F-55118: \\"Baby\\"/\\"You Mean Everything To Me\\" (also released in Canada on London Liberty F-55118 (45 rpm) and LI.55118 (78 rpm)) The Slades (Don Burch, John Goeke, Tommy Kaspar, Bobby Doyle, Jimmy Davis, Joyce Webb (Liberty single only)) *Liberty Records, Hollywood, California, December, 1957 (reissue with name change to Slades) :: F-55118: \\"Baby\\"/\\"You Mean Everything To Me\\" *Domino Records, Austin, Texas ::OR300/OR400: \\"Right Here\\"/\\"After You've Gone\\" (Joyce Webb with The Slades), 1957 ::R-500: \\"You Cheated\\"/\\"The Waddle\\", July 1958 (also released in Canada on Sparton 4-635R (45 rpm) and 636R (78 rpm) ::R-800: \\"You Gambled\\"/\\"No Time\\", 1958 (also released in Canada on Reo 8316X) ::R-901: \\"It's Better To Love\\"/\\"Just You\\", 1959 (promo release was R-900) ::1000: \\"You Must Try\\"/\\"Summertime\\", June 1959 ::R-903: \\"I Cheated (Joyce Harris and The Slades)/\\"Do You Know What It's Like To Be Lonesome?\\" (Joyce Harris), 1961 ::R-906: \\"It's Your Turn\\"/\\"Take My Heart\\", 1961 Bobby Doyle and The Ideals (Bobby Doyle, Chuck Joyce, George Millard, Merle Moden, Jeff Rampy, Jerry Squyres) *Trinity Records, Austin, Texas, 1958 :: AR-112: \\"Too Late\\"/\\"Chug-a- Lug\\" Bobby Doyle Three (Bobby Doyle, Ken Russell, Kenny Rogers) *Columbia Records, New York, NY, 1963 ::4-42613: \\"Empty Pockets Filled With Love\\" (Kirby Stone Four with Bobby Doyle Three)/\\"The Eyes Of Texas\\" (Kirby Stone Four) *Towne House Record Company, Houston, Texas ::TH-112: \\"Don't Feel Rained On\\"/\\"(Just A Summer Ago) Maggie\\", 1964 *Warner Bros.

He was noted for his large collection of ships' figureheads that he maintained at his house in Gravesend, and which he later donated to the Cutty Sark museum. == Biography == Cumbers was born in 1875 in Hackney, London, to Charles and Matilda Cumbers.\\"England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008,\\" Sydney Cumbers, 1875 He lost the use of an eye in an accident at age 12, after which he took to wearing an eyepatch and was subsequently nicknamed \\"Long John Silver\\". Cumbers worked in the family-run printing firm of \\"Johnstone, Cumbers and Sons\\" and by April 1905 had become a partner in the company. Cumbers was highly interested in the Merchant Navy, having been denied a life at sea by the loss of his eye, and began collecting memorabilia related to it. Though his main residence was in London, Cumbers acquired a second home at the coastal town of Gravesend in Kent. He began using the house to display his collection of nautical memorabilia and renamed it \\"The Lookout\\". The nautical theme extended to the rooms of his house which he named after parts of a ship such as \\"Quarter Deck\\", \\"Foc's'le\\", \\"Half Deck\\", \\"Bridge\\" and \\"Hurricane Deck\\" and to his wife who he referred to as \\"The Mate\\". Cumbers, his house and collection featured in a British Path√© film made in 1951. Cumbers died in 1959. == Figurehead collection == Part of the collection displayed in the new gallery at the Cutty Sark Cumbers' collection included more than 80 ships' figureheads, in addition to a number of individual body parts such as heads and arms. The Cumbers collection is the largest holding of historic figureheads in the world and includes some that date back more than 200 years and are up to tall. There are numerous depictions of historic characters in the collection including Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone, General Havelock, Pitt the Younger, General Gordon, Florence Nightingale, Hiawatha, Lalla Rookh, Diana, Sir Lancelot, Elizabeth Fry, William Wilberforce and Garibaldi. The lease on \\"The Lookout\\" ran out in 1953 and Cumbers took the opportunity to donate the figureheads to the Cutty Sark Preservation Society in memory of British merchant seamen and the little ships of Dunkirk. The museum lacked the space to display the entire collection, showing only 60 at a time with others remaining in storage or being loaned to other institutions. This situation was rectified when the large gallery space beneath the Cutty Sark opened on 26 April 2012 and the entire collection was shown for the first time. == References == Category:1875 births Category:1959 deaths Category:British collectors Category:Businesspeople from London Category:Collections of museums in the United Kingdom Category:People from the London Borough of Hackney ","title":"Sydney Cumbers"},{"id":"35337120","text":"S√°mal Johansen (born 31 October 1899 in Hald√≥rsv√≠k, Faroe Islands, died 11 March 1991) was a Faroese writer and teacher.

He was educated at the University of St Andrews, and placed with a writer to the signet at Edinburgh. At the age of 18 he went out as a writer to India, in the ship of Sir Home Popham, and about 1790 settled at Lucknow. Within two years from his arrival he was able to provide an annuity for his mother, then a widow. Paull was involved in a duel with Michael George Prendergast in 1795;historyofparliamentonline.org, Paull, James (1770‚Äì1808), of 2 Charles Street, Westminster. he was wounded, and in later life lost the use of his right arm. In 1801 he left Lucknow and came back to England for a time, but returned again to India the following year. Prominent in commerce life at Lucknow, Paull was sent to Lord Wellesley as a delegate of its traders. For a time they were on good terms, but they soon quarrelled. The rift almost led to a duel between Paull and Wellesley's friend Thomas Sydenham. ==In Parliament== In the latter part of 1804 Paull returned to England with the reputation of a nabob. He was a follower of the Prince of Wales; he was elected Member of Parliament for the borough of Newtown, Isle of Wight, on 5 June 1805, and before the month was out proceeded to move for papers relating to the dealings of Lord Wellesley with the Nawab of Awadh. He had many friends, among whom was William Windham, who introduced him to William Cobbett in June 1805. It was understood at that time that he was supported by the Whigs and the Prince; but when the Ministry of All the Talents was formed, it was impossible for the new government, which included Lord Grenville, to support him in his opposition to Wellesley, although Fox, Windham, and many of its leading members were in agreement with his views. The Prince of Wales asked him, through John McMahon to desist from any further proceedings. Paull instead spent the session of 1806 in moving for additional papers and in formulating his charges against the viceroy. He supported the parallel campaign against Wellesley by Charles Maclean. The friends of Lord Wellesley tried in July 1806 to force his hand, but, through the interposition of Sir Samuel Romilly, were prevented from carrying out their purpose. Paull widened his parliamentary interests, and succeeded to a limited extent in getting extra-parliamentary support from the direction of the East India Company. But he also touched on other areas, and began to associate with troublemaker MPs, Thomas Jones and Richard Bateman-Robson. A dissolution of parliament then intervened. ==The Westminster election== Paull, having been disappointed in his expectation of obtaining a seat for one of the prince's boroughs, stood for Westminster against Sheridan and Sir Samuel Hood (November). The contest was animated. Sir Francis Burdett had met him at Cobbett's, and had introduced him to John Horne Tooke. Burdett had himself been asked to stand for Westminster, but declined in favour of Paull, supporting him with all his influence and subscribing ¬£1,000 towards the expenses of the contest. Satirical print by James Gillray, Hood to the left, Sheridan to the right. The poll lasted fifteen days, when Hood and Sheridan were elected. On one occasion, when the candidates were on the hustings, a stage was brought from Drury Lane, with four tailors seated at work, a live goose, and several cabbages. James Gillray brought out several caricatures, including (1) a view of the hustings in Covent Garden; (2) \\"the high-flying candidate, little Paull goose, mounting from a blanket\\" held by Hood and Sheridan; (3) \\"the triumphal procession of little Paull, the tailor, upon his new goose\\". The defeated candidate, who polled 4,481 votes, petitioned against the return, and the matter came before the House of Commons on 5 and 18 March 1807, when the allegations were voted \\"false and scandalous\\". A duel between Paull and a Westminster politician, called Elliot, was stopped by the authorities at the close of 1806. ==1807 election== Paull stood again for Westminster at the election in May 1807 with even less success. Horne Tooke was now estranged. Cobbett was still his friend and praised him in his Political Register, on 9 May 1807, for the temptations which he had withstood; but the time came when he remarked, \\"Paull is too fond of the Bond Street set‚Äîhas too great a desire to live amongst the great\\". Burdett had been advertised by Paull as having agreed to take the chair at a dinner at the Crown and Anchor at an early stage in the election proceedings, but he repudiated the alleged engagement, and a duel ensued at Coombe Wood, near Wimbledon, on 2 May 1807. On the second exchange of shots, insisted upon by Paull, as Burdett declined to apologise, both were badly wounded. Gillray produced a caricature of the duel, and some ridicule was expressed over the circumstance that, through the absence of a medical officer and the lack of proper arrangements for carriages, both combatants were brought back to London in the same vehicle. As a consequence of the duel, Francis Place and his radical supporters switched to backing the wounded Burdett (who did not appear on the hustings). At the close of the election Burdett and Lord Cochrane were at the head of the poll with 5,134 and 3,708 votes respectively, while Paull obtained only 269. ==Death== Paull neglected his wounds, and suffered for three months. His election expenses had exhausted his resources, and he was disappointed in his expectations of assistance from India. For some weeks he showed signs of mental derangement. He lost over 1,600 guineas at a gaming- house in Pall Mall on the night of 14 April 1808. On the following day Paull deliberately attempted suicide, by piercing his right arm, and then by cutting his throat. He died at his house, Charles Street, Westminster, on 15 April 1808, and was buried at St. James's, Piccadilly, on 21 April. ==Correspondence, aftermath== In 1806 a \\"Lover of Consistency\\", presumed to be Paull himself, published A Letter to the Right Hon. C. J. Fox, on Fox's conduct on the charges against Lord Wellesley. The accusations brought against the Prince of Wales were repelled in 1806 in A Letter to the Earl of Moira. After the duel with Burdett there appeared in The Times a letter from Tooke, which was published separately; and he also issued a pamphlet, entitled A Warning to the Electors of Westminster from Mr. Horne Tooke, alleging that Paull had imposed on him; the accusation was countered in A Refutation of the Calumnies of John Horne Tooke, by James Paull, 1807. In 1808 there came out A Letter from Mr. Paull to Samuel Whitbread, in which he attributed the loss of his election for Westminster to the influence of another politician. His letter to Viscount Folkestone on the impeachment of the Marquis of Wellesley is in Cobbett's Political Register, on 25 October 1806. The charges against Wellesley were renewed in the House of Commons by Viscount Folkestone on 9 March 1808, but were negatived by 182 votes to 31. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1770 births Category:1808 deaths Category:Scottish politicians Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1802‚Äì1806 Category:British politicians who committed suicide ","title":"James Paull (MP)"},{"id":"35337188","text":"Freeman's, an auction house founded in Philadelphia in 1805.

Camiroaga hosted many shows for Chilean television station TVN, including the morning talk show Buenos D√≠as a Todos and a late-night talk show Animal Nocturno. He also acted in several TV series, such as Jaque Mate and Rojo y Miel, and in two films. Camiroaga twice hosted the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival in 2009 and 2010. He was nicknamed \\"Halc√≥n de Chicureo\\" (\\"Falcon of Chicureo\\") because he bred falcons in his residence in Chicureo, a rural area north of Santiago. Camiroaga died on 2 September 2011 after the military plane which was taking him and twenty others to Juan Fern√°ndez Archipelago crashed in the sea. Camiroaga's death was officially announced seven days later, and after a funeral oration at TVN's headquarters, he was buried in Santiago. He has been posthumously awarded several prizes, including the \\"Social Communicator Special Award\\" by the National Council of Television in 2011. ==Early life and studies== Camiroaga was born in Santiago, Chile. His parents were Jorge Camiroaga Puch and Mar√≠a de la Luz Fern√°ndez Stemann; he was the second of three brothers. Camiroaga and Fern√°ndez separated when Felipe was four years old. His mother moved to the Canary Islands in Spain, leaving her children with their father. In the Canaries, Fern√°ndez married Fernando Bontempi, with whom she had three children, including Spanish actress Paola Bontempi. Camiroaga was of Basque, German, and Peruvian descent; he traces his Peruvian ancestry to his paternal grandmother Irene Puch de Olaz√°bal who was born in Arequipa; Camiroaga's German blood is traced to his mother and paternal grandmother. His paternal grandfather was Carabineros de Chile colonel Humberto Camiroaga, Director of the Escuela de Carabineros de Chile. During his childhood, Camiroaga regularly visited rural places such as Villa Alegre, where his aunt Lavinia \\"Mirnia\\" Camiroaga lived, and Robinson Crusoe Island, marking his love for animals and the countryside. In 1981, while spending his vacations at the Juan Fern√°ndez Archipelago, Camiroaga offered to work as a camera assistant for a TV crew from Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile that was in the location, his first ever interaction with TV. Camiroaga was named an \\"Illustrious Son\\" of Villa Alegre in May 2011. Camiroaga completed his primary studies at Colegio San Ignacio de El Bosque, and his secondary studies at Colegio Marshall. In 1987 he completed studies of TV Production and Direction at Instituto Incacea. He also studied journalism at Las Condes University, but did not complete the course, and theater at Academia de Actuaci√≥n Fernando Gonz√°lez Mardones. ==Career in television== Camiroaga (left) in Buenos D√≠as a Todos with Tonka Tomicic, Marta Larraechea and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in 2009. Felipe Camiroaga started working as a camera assistant at the press department of television channel Red de Televisi√≥n Universidad de Chile (RTU, now Chilevisi√≥n) in 1988, and later as a production assistant at the channel's production department. But he quickly went from off to on-camera; his first job was as a host in a music video programme called Videotop, that was previously hosted by Pablo Aguilera and Justus Liebig. Later, he presented Extra J√≥venes, RTU's teenage-oriented show, which he co-hosted with Katherine Salosny. His chemistry with Salosny proved successful and he became her co-host a few months later. In 1991 he declined an offer to become a news anchor and continued at Extra J√≥venes, now co- presenting with Claudia Conserva. Camiroaga was hired by Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile (TVN) in 1992 to co-host Buenos D√≠as a Todos with Tati Penna, a breakfast programme first transmitted that year; however, the couple were later replaced by Margot Kahl and Jorge Hevia. Later, he had a brief television acting career, debuting in Jaque Mate, and later he portrayed an antagonistic character in Rojo y Miel. Despite being advised by actress Ana Reeves, Camiroaga did not receive good reviews for his acting performances. At the same time, he hosted some unsuccessful programmes, such as La Gran Apuesta and El Chapuz√≥n, and others with mixed results, such as Mot√≠n a Bordo and Contigo en Verano. However, at the end of the 1990s, he achieved success with prime time programme La Noche del Mundial, which was broadcast during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and Pase lo que Pase, a miscellaneous evening programme which he co-hosted with Karen Doggenweiler. Camiroaga (left) and Soledad Onetto (right) with Simply Red's Mick Hucknall at the 2009 Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival. Camiroaga also hosted prime time programmes during the 2000s such as Con Mucho Cari√±o and Ciudad G√≥tica, both of which did not complete a full season for their \\"controversial contents\\", and the first two seasons of the reality show Pelot√≥n. In 2004 he co-hosted Pasiones with B√°rbara Rebolledo, but he left the programme later that year and was replaced by Mart√≠n C√°rcamo. He returned to Buenos D√≠as a Todos in 2005, sharing duties with Tonka Tomicic, then with Katherine Salosny, and finally Carolina de Moras. The replacement of Salosny by de Moras was not well received and the local entertainment media blamed Camiroaga for it, which later resulted in a mass booing while Camiroaga was being awarded a Premio Copihue de Oro for \\"Best TV presenter\\" at the Teatro Caupolic√°n in Santiago, in 2010. In 2006, he began hosting his own talk show, Animal Nocturno. In February 2009 he co- presented the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival with Soledad Onetto, and also co-presented the 2010 edition. In 2010, Camiroaga co-hosted Halc√≥n y Camale√≥n with comedian Stefan Kramer. That same year, he received an offer from US television network Univisi√≥n to present a breakfast programme. Camiroaga rejected this offer and renewed his contract with TVN for three years. Characters Camiroaga proved to be versatile in his TV programmes, where he created characters such as El Washington, a poor man who lives on the street and survives on leftover food, distinguished by his humble origin. El Washington was created in Buenos D√≠as a Todos, and subsequently developed in Pase lo que Pase, where it became popular in sketch comedies with Karen Doggenweiler, the Se√±orita Andrea. Camiroaga hosted a radio programme called El Almac√©n del Washington in Coraz√≥n FM, dedicated to the trading of articles. One of Camiroaga's most recognized characters is Luciano Bello, a TV presenter native to Maracaibo, Venezuela. He is characterized by his large teeth and is coquettish with women. His typical phrase was: \\"You're hot and intelligent.\\" (\\"Eres rica e inteligente.\\") His name parodies Chilean-Venezuelan humanist Andr√©s Bello, and some of his moves parody those of the singer of same nationality Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez. Luciano Bello appeared for the first time in La Noche del Mundial in 1998. The character was strongly criticized by deputy Enrique Krauss, who called him vulgar. (\\"chabacano.\\") ==Other projects== As well as acting in TV series, Camiroaga was active in theatre and cinema. In 2000, he participated in the theatrical work Venecia, directed by Boris Quercia, starring Gabriela Medina, Carmen Barros, Tichi Lobos and Javiera Contador; Camiroaga was the only male actor. In 2006 he had a secondary role in the film Pretendiendo, directed by Claudio Dabed and starred by Uruguayan- Mexican actress B√°rbara Mori. The night before his death, on 1 September 2011, Camiroaga participated in the recording of the comedy film Stefan vs. Kramer with comedian Stefan Kramer and TV presenter Mart√≠n C√°rcamo. At first it was not known whether Camiroaga's scenes would appear in the film, whose release was scheduled for 2012. In late October 2011, Kramer said he would include the scenes in the film, as Camiroaga \\"wanted to be in it.\\" In 2001, the programme Pase lo que Pase released the album La Banda del Pase lo que Pase, in which Camiroaga debuted as a singer. The album was produced by Warner Music, and reached gold album status in Chile. Camiroaga also worked in advertising for Falabella and Ripley. At the time of his death, he still had an active contract with Ripley, who decided to remove all advertising in which Camiroaga appeared. ==Death== Camiroaga was travelling with a team from Buenos D√≠as a Todos, personnel from Desaf√≠o Levantemos Chile and the National Council of Culture and the Arts to Robinson Crusoe Island in the Juan Fern√°ndez Archipelago, when the Chilean Air Force (FACh) CASA C-212 Aviocar plane which was carrying them crashed into the sea and disintegrated while it was trying to land at the Robinson Crusoe Aerodrome, on 2 September 2011. The aircraft tried to touch down twice unsuccessfully before it disappeared. It was piloted by Lieutenant Carolina Fern√°ndez, one of the first female pilots in FACh's history, and Lieutenant Juan Pablo Mallea. Journalist Roberto Bruce ‚Äîalso part of Buenos D√≠as a Todos‚Äî and businessman Felipe Cubillos, were also aboard the plane. On 3 September 2011, Defense Minister Andr√©s Allamand said it was unlikely anyone survived the accident; they may have died instantly on impact. President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era decreed national mourning for the days of 5 and 6 September 2011. Seven days after the crash, Secretary General of Government Andr√©s Chadwick announced that body remains rescued from the sea were identified by DNA tests as Camiroaga, Felipe Cubillos and three other passengers. Camiroaga's remains were cremated in a private ceremony on 12 September 2011, and the next day a funeral oration was conducted at the Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile's headquarters, which was broadcast live by the station. It was attended by five hundred people invited by his family and the TV channel. After the service, the amphora containing the presenter's ashes was moved in a hearse under a police escort, which was followed by his relatives. A crowd of around five thousand people accompanied the hearse from Barrio Bellavista to the P√©rgola de las Flores, in Recoleta. After this, his remains were taken to the Parque del Recuerdo cemetery, where a private ceremony was conducted, attended by relatives and Camiroaga's closest friends. On 16 November 2011, Camiroaga's ashes were taken to the Lugar de Los Hombres Ilustres of Villa Alegre's churchyard. ==Posthumous homages and reactions== An advertising balloon in the garden of TVN was decorated by the public with signs, flags and balloons after the plane crash. On 8 October 2011, fans of Camiroaga visited his sepulture at Parque del Recuerdo cemetery in Recoleta, to commemorate what would have been his forty-fifth birthday. After the announcement of Camiroaga's death in the crash, thousands of people went to the fa√ßade of the Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile (TVN) headquarters, in the commune of Providencia, to express their love and affection for Camiroaga, the rest of the team from Buenos D√≠as a Todos and the other plane passengers. Such expressions of support were repeated in regional headquarters of the TV channel, where they placed some condolence books for the public. On 5 September 2011, Juli√°n Elfenbein, Carolina de Moras, Jorge Hevia, Karen Doggenweiler and emblematic staff of Buenos D√≠as a Todos, friends, TVN personalities and from other channels ‚Äî including competitors of the programme ‚Äî joined to pay tribute to Camiroaga in his program. In that episode of Buenos D√≠as a Todos, the first since Camiroaga's death, his friend and TV director Daniel Sag√º√©s commented that Felipe once told him that he wanted Silvio Rodr√≠guez's song \\"√Ångel para un Final\\" to be played in his funeral. As soon as Rodr√≠guez was informed of this, he commented on his blog it would be a \\"high honour\\" for him that his song was played at Camiroaga's funeral. Other international personalities, such as Lucero, Yuri, Ricardo Montaner, Alejandro Sanz, Ricky Martin, Luis Fonsi, amid others, expressed their sadness and consternation at Camiroaga's death, through the social networks Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The plane crash was extensively covered by the press, nationally and internationally, emphasizing the figure of the TV presenter, including BBC News from the United Kingdom. Qatari news channel Al Jazeera covered the news on the plane crash immediately after it occurred and also emphasized the deaths of Camiroaga and Felipe Cubillos. In Argentina, various media outlets referred to Camiroaga as \\"the Chilean Tinelli\\", in reference to Argentinean presenter Marcelo Tinelli. An Argentinean TV programme called Duro de Domar mocked the Juan Fern√°ndez tragedy, focusing on Camiroaga and his relationships with Roc√≠o Marengo and Cecilia Bolocco, provoking harsh attacks from Chileans in social networks. Chilean newspaper Las √öltimas Noticias caused controversy on 2 September 2011; its digital edition cover was headlined \\"The last flight of the Falcon\\" (\\"El √∫ltimo vuelo del halc√≥n\\"), which generated outrage from Internet users, as Camiroaga's whereabouts were unknown at the time. The cover was replaced and the next day the newspaper said the public had misinterpreted the intention of the headline. Televisi√≥n Nacional de Chile decided to name the studio from which Buenos D√≠as a Todos is transmitted \\"Felipe Camiroaga Fern√°ndez\\", and kept free the TV presenter's parking space to remember him. The municipality of Colina, where Camiroaga lived in Chicureo, announced they would name him posthumously \\"Illustrious Son\\" of the community. and the Lo Arcaya Avenue would be renamed after him. Additionally, the Chilean Telethon (Telet√≥n) paid homage to Camiroaga and the twenty other passengers of the aircraft in its opening and at the Julio Mart√≠nez National Stadium in the fundraising's 2011 edition. On 26 September 2011, the National Council of Television (Consejo Nacional de Televisi√≥n; CNTV) awarded posthumously Camiroaga with the \\"Special Award in Communications.\\" The Sala Felipe Camiroaga (Felipe Camiroaga Room) in the Museum of Villa Alegre was inaugurated on 3 May 2012; personal belongings, public and private photographs and a bust of Camiroaga made by Galavarino Ponce are exhibited. His father, siblings, his partner Fernanda Hansen, close friends and followers were present at the ceremony. In 2013, and as part of the student movement which started in 2011 demanding higher quality and free education in Chile -- a movement which Camiroaga supported -- students of the Law School of the University of Valpara√≠so created the Juventud Rebelde Felipe Camiroaga (Felipe Camiroaga Rebel Youth) political group, which describes itself as \\"[a group of] left-wing students with no defined party, who believe that organization and participation are the necessary tools to make the changes we want,\\" specifying also that \\"revolution is made by parts\\", satirizing Camiroaga's death. The group, according to Publimetro Chile, is \\"partly satire, partly real facts\\", and is not supposed to use Camiroaga's image as a \\"martyr\\", but as \\"a person who puts them into a crucial movilization frame.\\" The Juventud Rebelde Felipe Camiroaga group has been replicated in other universities, including the University of Chile and the Metropolitan University of Educational Sciences. ==Personal life== Although Camiroaga had several romantic relationships within the media industry, Camiroaga never married, and was considered \\"one of the most coveted bachelors\\" by the Chilean tabloid press. Camiroaga was linked romantically with several Chilean TV personalities, such as Katherine Salosny, Ang√©lica Castro, Karen Doggenweiler, B√°rbara Rebolledo, Paz Bascu√±√°n and Fernanda Hansen, with whom he was in a relationship at the time of his death. He was also linked to Roc√≠o Marengo, Francini Amaral, Krishna Navas, amid others. In 1992, he had a short-lived relationship with Mexican singer and actress Lucero while they were jurors at the 1992 edition of the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival; the relationship later developed into friendship. Camiroaga lived in a land lot near Chicureo. He lives as a huaso-style farm owner dedicated to the breeding of horses, dogs and birds. In February 2011, his house was totally destroyed by a fire. Although it was first reported the fire was caused by an electrical failure, the possibility that it was arson was later considered. Felipe Camiroaga practiced polo; he also was an aviation enthusiast and completed his pilot training in 1996. ==Political views== Camiroaga (left) with former President of Chile Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, which he supported in the 2009‚Äì2010 elections, during an interview for his talk show Animal Nocturno. In his later years, Camiroaga openly demonstrated his political preferences, something uncommon in Chilean television presenters. Although he grew up in a right-wing family, supportive of the Pinochet military regime, Camiroaga supported the Concertaci√≥n coalition of left-wing parties since Chile became a democracy; in 2008 he said he was a \\"Bacheletist\\" (\\"bacheletista\\") ‚Äîsupporter of President of Chile Michelle Bachelet‚Äî in the Caras magazine, and in 2009 he said Chile was admired for the governments of such a coalition. In 2010 he joined the runoff campaign of Eduardo Frei Ruiz- Tagle, the Concertaci√≥n candidate for the Chilean presidential election. Frei said Camiroaga was a \\"very brave man\\" for publicly expressing his political views. Camiroaga also participated in campaigns by Greenpeace; he openly asked Chile's Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter on Buenos D√≠as a Todos for the government, led by Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, to halt the installation of a thermoelectric plant in Caleta Punta Choros‚Äîwhich was later reversed‚Äî and supported the 2011 student movement in Chile. ==Filmography== ;As a television presenter { class= width=450px - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" !

The music consists of elements of traditional Volksmusik from Switzerland as well as folk music from other regions, but also many other different styles of music. The project thus follows the old spirit of Swiss folk music, that has always been a constantly changing and growing mixture of different influences paired with local folklore. The lyrics are written and performed in the local High Alemannic German dialect.

Member organizations agreed to the CSSO Letter of Agreement (of January 8/9, 1983. ==History== The CSSO emerged from a series of informal interorganizational meetings throughout 1982 among Solidarity support organizations. To provide a formal basis for cooperation, and to increase the unity of these support organizations, organizers drafted an agreement. the CSSO Letter of Agreement To join the CSSO, organizations had to ratify the CSSO Letter. In it, groups agreed to support and recognize Solidarity in Poland, along with the Coordinating Office Abroad of NSZZ Solidarnosc (based in Brussels, Belgium). Member organizations still had the freedom to support their own initiatives in Poland and were not required to support the Brussels office, nor proscribe any other links or channels with Solidarity. The CSSO was designed as a forum in which member organizations could exchange ideas and share experiences pertaining to protest activities in Poland. The organization held meetings in which member representatives would consider joint CSSO resolutions and actions. The CSSO did not control the activities or funds of the member organizations. . The Coordinating Committee of the CSSO and its administrators had no executive powers. They could only recommend action to the CSSO Participating Organizations; participation in any CSSO action or program was strictly voluntary. In 1988 at a Paris meeting, an initiatives to create a more formal CSSO structure was defeated. The CSSO ultimately included 46 organizations in 13 countries. The one major amendment to the CSSO agreement was the addition of regional associations within the CSSO structure. ==Achievements== The greatest impact of the CSSO was in fostering trust among the leaders of the member organizations. This did indeed foster collaboration and thus improved the efficacy of numerous initiatives and programs. Most of the accomplishments came from the member organizations themselves. These accomplishments range from: a massive smuggling of materials to Solidarity and other groups in Poland; to the above-ground Family-to-Family assistance to the families of the imprisoned and persecuted Solidarity activists; to the Independent Polish Agency news agency providing information and photographs to the news media across the globe; to the professional periodic publications such as Kontakt (Paris), PoglƒÖd and Meinung (West Berlin), Voice of Solidarity (London), ARKA de Informaciones (Mexico City), and Porando-geppo (Tokyo); to political action, lobbying and raising awareness activities in every country; to assistance to the Brussels Coordinating Office and activists in their work on behalf of Solidarity; to sending financial resources to Solidarity and opposition groups in Poland. The membership of the CSSO organizations consisted primarily of the citizens of the countries where these organizations were located and usually included members who were not of Polish heritage. David Phillips, the first CSSO Secretary, was not of Polish ancestry. In fact in some organizations, the majority were not of Polish heritage, though sometimes did include non-Poles who were nevertheless fluent in Polish ‚Äì Yoshiho Umeda (CSSO Asian Coordinator), and Jan Axel Stolz, who served as CSSO Secretary. == CSSO Participating Organizations (1989) == * Solidarity Victorian Fellowship, Notting Hill Victoria AUSTRALIA * Action Group in Support of Solidarity, Montreal, Quebec CANADA * Friends of Solidarity, Kitchener, Ontario CANADA * Friends of Solidarity Edmonton Alberta CANADA * Friends of Solidarnosc Association Vancouver British Columbia CANADA * Group of Solidarity in St. Catharines St. Catharines Ontario CANADA * Polish Canadian Action Group Toronto Ontario CANADA * Polish Socio-Political Group Independence-Solidarity Calgary Alberta CANADA * Solidarity Support Committee of Toronto Toronto Ontario CANADA * Solidarnosc Assistance Association Ottawa Ontario CANADA * Stowarzyszenie Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Solidarno≈õci - Winnipeg Winnipeg Manitoba CANADA * Stot Solidarnosc Copenhagen DENMARK * Edition Spotkania Paris FRANCE * KONTAKT Vanves FRANCE * Radio Solidarnosc Paris FRANCE * Solidarite pour Solidarnosc Roubaix FRANCE * Committee to Support ISTU Solidarity in Japan Tokyo JAPAN * Comite de Apoyo a Solidarnosc Mexico DF MEXICO * Inst.

It marketed what is now known as a blade server. Founded in 1999 by Christopher Hipp, one of the inventors of the blade server, and former Compaq Computers employees, the company pioneered the use of blade servers, a compact, stripped-down computer server that includes all of the necessary components to operate as a computer while taking up minimal space on a standard 19-inch rack and minimizing power consumption. It became part of Hewlett-Packard in 2005. ==History== RLX was first founded in 1999 as RocketLogix, Inc. with a connection to a Dallas-based investment firm, Cracken Harkey, Co.

It was directed by Ing Kanjanavanit and produced by Manit Sriwanichpoom. The Yingluck Shinawatra government banned the film as a national security threat due to the film's visual references to the paramilitary's violent crackdown on student protesters in the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976. The Thai-language film tells the story of a theatre group in a fictional country resembling Thailand that is staging a production of Macbeth, in which an ambitious general murders his way to the Scottish throne. One of the film's main characters is a dictator named \\"Dear Leader\\", who bears a resemblance to former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup. ==Controversy== Censors at the culture ministry issued a brief statement saying that the film could not be distributed in Thailand because it \\"has content that causes divisiveness among the people of the nation\\", without specifying which scenes were offensive. Ing Kanjanavanit, the film's director, said the censorship committee objected to anti-monarchical overtones in the film as well as politically-charged content, including a scene based on a photograph from Bangkok's 1976 student uprising showing a demonstrator being lynched. Ing said she will appeal to overturn the ban. \\"The committee questioned why we wanted to bring back violent pain from the past to make people angry,\\" Ing said in an interview. The censors also disliked the attire of a murderer in the film, who wore a bright red hooded cloak‚Äîthe same colour worn by the pro-Thaksin demonstrators known as the Red Shirts. The director called the ruling absurd and a reflection of the fear in Thai society. \\"I feel like we are heading to a very dark, dark place right now, a place full of fears and everyone has to be extra careful about what they say,\\" she said, adding that the character resembling Thaksin could represent any leader accused of corruption and abuse of power. \\"When Cambodians watch this they'll think it's Hun Sen. When Libyans watch it they would think it's Gaddafi.\\" Sharp partisan political battles in the wake of the 2006 coup have unleashed fierce questioning of established institutions in Thailand. In 2011, the film board banned a movie about a transgender father struggling to raise two children, called Insects in the Backyard, saying it contained scenes that were immoral and pornographic. ==Documentary film about the controversy == A documentary film about the censorship and controversy surrounding the film called Censor Must Die was screened for the first time on 1 June 2013, at the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre (BACC). Manit Sriwanichpoom made a short speech prior to the screening which was attended by an audience of several hundred. == References * Category:Thai films Category:Thai- language films Category:Modern adaptations of works by William Shakespeare Category:Films based on Macbeth Category:Films set in Thailand Category:2010s drama films Category:Thai drama films ","title":"Shakespeare Must Die"},{"id":"35337483","text":"√Ålberis S√©rgio √Çngelo da Silva (born 2 December 1984) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender. ==References * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Association football defenders Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:√Ötvidabergs FF players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Superettan players Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden Category:FC Link√∂ping City players ","title":"√Ålberis da Silva"},{"id":"35337495","text":"Yariabad (, also Romanized as YƒÅrƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Afshariyeh Rural District, Khorramdasht District, Takestan County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Although intent on a career in journalism she was picked by BBC Radio 1 for a place on their production training scheme which she took up on graduating with a 2:1. ==Journalism== Nadler became the first female producer that Radio 1 had recruited externally and she went on to produce The Radio 1 Chart Show and various other shows. But, in 1992 she took a post at Conservative Central Office as a senior press officer in the run up to that year's general election. She had been a Young Conservative during her teens, motivated to become politically active by her father's history as childhood refugee escaping Nazism, and welcomed the job move as a way of re-establishing her political expertise. She returned to the BBC two years later to work as a political producer; initially this was at a regional level on the magazine programme Around Westminster, but eventually she was offered a post with the broadcaster's Sunday lunchtime political flagship, John Humphrey's On the Record, where she was both producer and reporter. Nadler became a freelance journalist following the Conservatives' landslide defeat at the 1997 general election. With New Labour in power she set about researching a book about the likely next leader of the Conservative Party. When confirmed as leader, William Hague, agreed to cooperate with the project although she retained editorial independence. The biography, William Hague: In his own Right was published by Politicos in 2000 Her second book Too Nice to be a Tory: Its my party and I'll cry if I want to was published by Simon and Schuster in 2005. It used the structure of a personal memoir to tell the wider story of the changing fate of the Conservative Party in the years since 1979. The book was well reviewed and brought her further work as a political commentator and author who makes regular appearances on radio and television, as well as writing for various newspapers and magazines. She has appeared on programmes as diverse as BBC One's Question Time, Channel 5's The Wright Stuff and BBC Radio 4's Any Questions. Written contributions include articles for The Guardian, The Scotsman and The Spectator. ==Political career== On 6 May 2010, Nadler was elected to Wandsworth Borough Council as a representative of the Conservative Party. She served one term majoring on schools and licensing but stood down in 2014 to concentrate on her young family. ==Personal life== Jo- Anne Nadler's father James Nadler became a naturalised British citizen in the 1950s and went on to senior status at the BBC World Service Radio. He died when she was 11. Her mother is a landscape painter, Hilary Nadler. Nadler was a member of the Young Conservatives as a teenager during the early 1980s, and has spoken about how friends at the BBC found it difficult to understand her political affiliation. She recalls being described as a \\"Trendy Tory\\" by a lazy sub while never actually using the term herself . ==Bibliography== * William Hague: In his own Right (2000) * Too Nice to be a Tory: It's My Party and I'll Cry If I Want to (2004) * David Cameron: The Regeneration Game (2007) ==References* Category:1960s births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of York Category:English women journalists Category:BBC newsreaders and journalists Category:English writers Category:Conservative Party (UK) officials Category:Conservative Party (UK) councillors Category:Councillors in the London Borough of Wandsworth Category:English women writers Category:British women television journalists Category:Women radio presenters ","title":"Jo-Anne Nadler"},{"id":"35337549","text":"Vidaurre may refer to: ==People== *Antonio Vidaurre (1724‚Äì1780), Spanish painter, poet and writer *Jos√© Antonio Vidaurre (1798‚Äì1837), Chilean military officer who led a failed insurrection in 1837 *Jos√© Milla y Vidaurre (1822‚Äì1882), Guatemalan writer *Violeta Vidaurre (born 1928), Chilean writer ==Geography== *Vidaurre Rock, a rock which breaks the surface at low water east of Acuna Rocks in the Duroch Islands, Trinity Peninsula ==See also== *Estadio Carlos Vidaurre Garc√≠a, a multi-use stadium in Tarapoto, Peru *Estadio Municipal Carlos Vidaurre Garc√≠a, a multi-use stadium in Tarapoto, Peru *Vadaure, Nepal *Vidarte, a surname *Vidura, a character in the Mahabharata ","title":"Vidaurre"},{"id":"35337556","text":"Loret Fahri Sadiku (born 28 July 1991) is a Kosovan professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Turkish club Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. ==Club career== Early career Loret joined IFK V√§rnamo youth setup in 2003.

He was regarded as \\"the most learned Irish lawyer of his time\\", but he had a somewhat turbulent political career and was twice accused of treason. ==Background== He belonged to a junior branch of the great Anglo-Irish dynasty of Bermingham, which held the titles Earl of Louth and Baron Athenry. He was probably the grandson of John Bermyngham, judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), who died in 1415.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 184 Patrick Bermingham, a later Chief Justice, was his cousin. Little seems to be known of his own parents. ==Career== He is first heard of during the Wars of the Roses, when he was acting as legal adviser to James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormonde, who was a staunch supporter of the House of Lancaster. Ormonde was executed by the rival dynasty, the House of York, after their decisive victory at the Battle of Towton in March 1461, and Bermingham himself was condemned to death as a traitor in 1462.Otway-Ruthvn, A. J. History of Mediaeval Ireland Barnes and Noble p.398 He soon received a royal pardon and, under the tolerant regime of the new Yorkist King Edward IV, his Lancastrian past was not held against him. He became King's Serjeant in Ireland in 1463; the following year he was nominated as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas but for unknown reasons did not take up that office. He held lands in County Louth, and also at Dunshaughlin in County Meath where he helped found a chantry.Ball p.184 In 1474 he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. His predecessor, John Chevir, whose wife was a Bermingham, left part of his estate to him.Register of Wills and Inventories of the Diocese of Dublin in the time of Archbishops Tregury and Walton 1457‚Äì1483 : from the original manuscript in Trinity College Dublin, edited by Henry F. Berry Dublin 1898 In 1478 he was described as one of those \\"men of influence\\" who opposed the new Lord Deputy of Ireland, Henry, Lord Grey of Codnor. Bermingham and his allies entirely frustrated Grey's efforts to establish his authority in Ireland, leading to his recall to England.Otway-Ruthven p. 398 ==Readings in law== At a time when there was no formal training for law students in Dublin, Bermingham was one of a number of senior judges who provided a rudimentary legal education for those students who would later go on to one of the English Inns of Court. Many years later Sir William Darcy, the Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, recalled that in 1482-3 he had been one of a number of students who read the leading English legal texts with John Estrete, Deputy to the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, while during the holidays Bermingham taught them dancing and the harp (these were not simply recreations but formed part of a young lawyer's education).Kenny, Colum King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press 1992 pp.21‚Äì2 Nicholas Sutton, Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), who died young in 1478, thought highly enough of him to leave his family in Bermingham's care.Ball p.103 ==Later years== He was continued in office by Richard III and Henry VII. Like nearly all the Anglo-Irish nobility he made the mistake of supporting the pretender Lambert Simnel, and faced charges of treason after the ruin of Simnel's cause at the Battle of Stoke. Henry VII, however, decided on a policy of clemency, and Bermingham, together with most of his judicial colleagues, (as well as Simnel himself) was quickly pardoned.Ball p.106 In 1488 he pledged his fealty to the King in the person of the King's representative, Sir Richard Edgcumbe.D'Alton, John King James's Irish Army List reissued 1997 Celtic Bookshop Limerick p.526 ==Family== Little seems to be known about his wife.

Two days before the event, on April 25, the SPC issued a moderate risk of severe weather encompassing portions of central and eastern Kentucky, middle and eastern Tennessee, northeast Mississippi, central and northern Alabama, and northwest Georgia. Due to the combination of rich low-level moisture, strong shear, and focused large-scale ascent, there was relatively high confidence across the outlined area for strong tornadoes ‚Äì a tornado rated EF2 or higher on the Enhanced Fujita scale ‚Äì and widespread damaging winds. By the morning of April 27, the SPC upgraded to a high risk of severe weather, noting that a dangerous tornado outbreak capable of producing several violent ‚Äì EF4 tornado or stronger on the Enhanced Fujita scale ‚Äì and long-track tornadoes was expected. Shortly before 12:00 CDT, the probability of tornadoes within 25 miles of a location was increased even further to 45%, a level exceeding even typical high risk standards, for an area including Tuscaloosa. The forecast continued to emphasize the risk of strong/violent and very damaging tornadoes, as confidence increased even further regarding the risk for an extreme, high- end tornado outbreak. Throughout the afternoon hours, in the wake of an earlier mesoscale convective system, the airmass across western and northern portions of Alabama began to quickly destabilize, with mixed layer convective available potential energy (CAPE) estimated in the 2500‚Äì4000 j/kg range and low-level dewpoints of 70‚Äì72 ¬∞F surging northward from Louisiana. Meanwhile, the wind shear environment became substantially more favorable as an 80‚Äì100 kn mid-level jet ejected eastward into the region. At 1:45 p.m. CDT (18:45 UTC), a Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) tornado watch was issued for much of Alabama, northwest Georgia, southeast Mississippi, and southern middle Tennessee, with a >95% probability of at least two tornadoes and one or more strong tornadoes. Shortly thereafter, at 3:09 p.m. CDT (20:09 UTC), the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Mississippi issued the first tornado warning on the supercell that would eventually produce the Tuscaloosa‚ÄìBirmingham tornado. ==Tornado summary== Radar reflectivity and velocity images of the supercell that produced the tornado at 5:12 p.m. CDT (22:10 UTC) as it struck Tuscaloosa, with a debris ball clearly visible. The supercell produced a large wedge tornado in rural Greene County, Alabama, which tracked towards the neighboring Tuscaloosa County at EF2 intensity, uprooting numerous trees and causing minor damage to structures. Near Union at 4:50 p.m. CDT, the tornado was captured live on ABC 33/40 by meteorologist John Oldshue. This was the first video evidence that the tornado had touched the ground, and a tornado emergency was declared. Rapidly intensifying, the tornado moved towards the southern and eastern portions of Tuscaloosa at around 5:10 p.m. CDT (22:10 UTC). Skycams operated by Tuscaloosa-based television station WVUA-CA (channel 7) as well as Birmingham Fox affiliate WBRC (channel 6), ABC affiliate WBMA-LD/WCFT-TV/WJSU-TV (channels 58, 33, and 40), and CBS affiliate WIAT (channel 42) captured video of the tornado as it struck Tuscaloosa. The destroyed Chastain Manor apartment complex near Alberta City, Tuscaloosa. The complex was later rebuilt.Chastain Manor The tornado entered the southern portion of Tuscaloosa as a low-end EF4 and crossed 35th Street, completely destroying a cell phone tower and several warehouses in an industrial area. It passed within a ¬Ω mile of the Tuscaloosa Police Department Headquarters, forcing the evacuation of the dispatch personnel from the third floor offices until the storm passed. At that same time, the Tuscaloosa County Emergency Management Office sustained a direct hit and was totally destroyed along with most of their equipment and vehicles but with no injuries to the staff present.http://www.weather.gov/bmx/event_04272011tuscbirm The tornado then ripped through the neighborhoods of Rosedale and Forest Lake, leveling and sweeping away numerous poorly-anchored homes. Several apartment complexes were entirely destroyed in this area, and a few two-story apartment buildings were completely reduced to rubble. The tornado crossed the intersection of 15th Street and McFarland Boulevard, and numerous businesses and restaurants near the University Mall were completely flattened at low-end EF4 strength, and vehicles were either tossed around or destroyed. The nearby Cedar Crest subdivision was devastated as numerous block-foundation homes were leveled. The tornado maintained its strength as it continued through the neighborhood of Alberta City, leveling and sweeping away numerous block-foundation homes, and completely flattening two more apartment buildings and a shopping center along University Boulevard. As the tornado exited the Alberta City section, the Chastain Manor Apartments (which were nailed, rather than bolted to their foundations) were completely destroyed and partially swept away. A well- anchored clubhouse on the property was mostly swept away and its remains were scattered into a pond, even though the structure had lacked interior walls. A nearby manhole cover was removed from its drain and thrown into a ravine.https://ams.confex.com/ams/26SLS/webprogram/Manuscript/Paper211667/TCLmerged.pdf The tornado then grew from to wide and ripped through the suburb of Holt, leveling and sweeping away homes while still at low-end EF4 strength. Every tree was snapped in this area, including those within deep ravines. As it crossed Hurricane Creek, it tore apart a large metal railroad trestle, and a metal truss support structure was thrown up on a nearby hill. A marina on Holt Lake was significantly impacted, with numerous boats and a restaurant destroyed; some boats were tossed over in this area. The tornado exited the Tuscaloosa area and weakened to low-end EF3 status while contracting back to wide. It continued through a dense forest towards Birmingham, this time downing thousands of trees and flattening more rural homes. Numerous trees were completely denuded and debarked as the tornado passed near the rural communities of Searles and Mud Creek, and debris from Tuscaloosa was reported to be falling from the sky across Birmingham over away in Jefferson County. A total of 44 people were killed in the Tuscaloosa area. Major damage to homes and apartment buildings in the Birmingham neighborhood of Pratt City. After causing massive timber damage in rural areas, the tornado entered Jefferson County and rapidly intensified to its maximum intensity and width. Many stations, including WIAT (channel 42), WBMA/WCFT/WJSU (channel 33/40), WTVY (channel 4) in Dothan and WSFA (channel 12) in Montgomery, showed television cameras capturing the event as the tornado moved east-northeast across the western and northern suburbs of Birmingham at high-end EF4 strength around 6:00 p.m. CDT (23:00 UTC). Several suburbs in the area sustained catastrophic damage from the tornado as it tore through the west side of Birmingham, resulting in twenty fatalities. The suburbs of Concord, Pleasant Grove, and McDonald Chapel, along with residential areas in northern Birmingham itself, were devastated. Extensive wind-rowing of debris was noted in Concord and Pleasant Grove, numerous trees were debarked, and some homes were swept away (though much of the debris remained next to the foundations and was not scattered, and most vehicles were not moved more than ). As the tornado moved across a coal yard in this area, a coal car was thrown through the air. Past the coal yard, the tornado weakened to EF2 intensity, but still was able to destroy numerous pier and beam foundations homes and several industrial warehouses in McDonald Chapel. A four-sided brick home in the area also had its roof torn off, but none of its exterior walls collapsed. Numerous homes, apartment buildings, and a large church sustained significant damage as the tornado entered Birmingham's city limits and impacted the neighborhood of Pratt City. Vehicles were also moved, although it was only by a couple of feet at best. Major EF2 damage continued as the weakening, but still very large wedge tornado then struck the suburb of Fultondale, damaging homes and businesses in town. Light poles were damaged along Interstate 65 and a Days Inn and several other commercial buildings sustained major damage along US 31 before began the tornado to rapidly narrow and weaken. Some additional EF0 to EF1 damage occurred before the tornado dissipated two miles north of Tarrant. A total of 20 people were killed throughout Birmingham and its surrounding suburbs. Cleanup in Tuscaloosa's Cedar Crest neighborhood in May (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo) The National Weather Service determined the path length of this violent tornado to be with a maximum damage path width of , or . The final rating of this tornado was a source of controversy, as some survey teams concluded EF5 damage, while others did not. The structures that were swept away by this tornado were either improperly anchored, lacked interior walls, or were surrounded by contextual damage not consistent with winds exceeding , and as a result an EF5 rating could not be applied. Therefore, it was given a final rating of high-end EF4, with winds estimated at . Early reports indicated 65 people were killed, with over 1,000 injured. However, this was revised to 64 deaths and more than 1,500 injuries. President Barack and First Lady Michelle Obama visited Tuscaloosa on April 29, taking a ground tour of some of the affected areas. Obama was quoted as saying that he had \\"never seen devastation like this.\\" He stated further that he had already declared a federal state of emergency in Alabama. ==Aftermath== By the time the tornado lifted northeast of Birmingham, it had left behind a path of destruction of through Greene, Tuscaloosa and Jefferson counties. The tornado killed 64 people, including six University of Alabama students. It caused approximately $2.4 billion of property damage, surpassing the 1999 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado as the costliest single tornado in United States history at that time. Less than a month later, however, this number was surpassed by the Joplin, Missouri EF5 tornado, which caused $2.8 billion in damage. ==See also== *2011 Super Outbreak *Tornadoes of 2011 *2011 Hackleburg‚ÄìPhil Campbell tornado ‚Äì A similarly deadly tornado that was part of the same outbreak. *List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks *Tornado intensity and damage *List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes *Tornado records *December 2000 Tuscaloosa tornado ==References * Interview with Storm Chaser of April 27 Tuscaloosa Tornado * Full video of this tornado taken by the above storm chaser from Tuscaloosa University Mall parking lot * Full episode of Discovery Channel's Storm Chasers about the Tuscaloosa Tornado Category:F4 tornadoes by date Tuscaloosa-Birmingham Category:Tornadoes in Alabama Tuscaloosa-Birmingham Category:Tuscaloosa, Alabama Tornado,2011-04-27,Tuscaloosa-Birmingham Category:2011 in Alabama Tuscaloosa- Birmingham Tornado es:Tornado de 2011 en Tuscaloosa-Birmingham it:Tornado di Tuscaloosa-Birmingham del 2011 ms:Puting beliung Mei 2011 vi:B√£o l·ªëc xo√°y t·∫°i Tuscaloosa-Birmingham, 2011 ","title":"2011 Tuscaloosa‚ÄìBirmingham tornado"},{"id":"35337595","text":"The Rio International Open Jiu-Jitsu Championship is a contest realized annually since 2008, in Tijuca T√™nis Clube, in Rio de Janeiro.

It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 4, 2012. The law prohibits the use of non- public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees. It confirms changes to the Commodity Exchange Act, specifies reporting intervals for financial transactions. After a 60 Minutes segment on congressional insider trading in 2011, Republican Senator Scott Brown and Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced bills to combat the practice. In February 2012, the STOCK Act passed in the Senate by a 96‚Äì3 vote; the only no votes were senators Jeff Bingaman, Richard Burr, and Tom Coburn. Later the House of Representatives passed it by a 417‚Äì2 vote. The bill was supported heavily by vulnerable incumbents and signed into law by President Obama. According to the current United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics, \\"A member, officer, or employee of the Senate shall not receive any compensation, nor shall he permit any compensation to accrue to his beneficial interest from any source, the receipt or accrual of which would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position as a member, officer, or employee.\\" == About STOCK == The STOCK Act is an original bill to prohibit members of Congress and employees of Congress from using private information derived from their official positions for personal benefit, and for other purposes. With this bill in place, members of Congress are no longer allowed to use information garnered through official business for personal reasons. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act prohibits members and employees of Congress from using \\"any nonpublic information derived from the individual's position ... or gained from performance of the individual's duties, for personal benefit\\". The bill also applies to all employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government. The STOCK Act requires a one-year study of the growing political intelligence industry, and requires every Member of Congress to publicly file and disclose any financial transaction of stocks, bond, commodities futures, and other securities within 45 days on their websites, rather than once a year as they do now. The Act also requires members of Congress and Executive branch officials to disclose the terms of mortgages on their homes, prohibits them from receiving special access to initial public stock offerings, and denies federal pensions to members of Congress who are convicted of felonies involving public corruption. The bill is divided into nineteen sections. == Official summary == The following summary was written by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress, which serves Congress. Section 3 Requires the congressional ethics committees to issue interpretive guidance of the rules of each chamber, including rules on conflicts of interest and gifts, with respect to the prohibition against the use by Members of Congress and congressional employees (including legislative branch officers and employees), as a means for making a private profit, of any nonpublic information derived from their positions as Members or congressional employees, or gained from performance of the individual's official responsibilities. Section 4 Declares that such Members and employees are not exempt from the insider trading prohibitions arising under the securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to declare that such Members and employees owe a duty arising from a relationship of trust and confidence to Congress, the U.S. government, and U.S. citizens with respect to material, nonpublic information derived from their positions as Members or congressional employees or gained from performance of the individual's official responsibilities. Section 5 Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to apply to Members and congressional employees, or to judicial officers or employees its prohibitions against certain transactions, involving the purchase or sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery, or any swap. Section 6 Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (EGA) to require specified individuals to file reports within 30 to 45 days after receiving notice of a purchase, sale, or exchange which exceeds $1,000 in stocks, bonds, commodities futures, and other forms of securities, subject to any waivers and exclusions. Lists such individuals as: (1) the President; (2) the Vice President; (3) executive officers or employees, including certain special government employees and members of a uniformed service; (4) appointed administrative law judges; (5) executive branch employees in positions excepted from the competitive service because of their confidential or policymaking character (except those excluded from such exception by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics [OGE]); (6) the Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General, each Governor of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service, and certain U.S. Postal Service officers or employees; (7) the OGE Director and each designated agency ethics official; (8) civilian employees of the Executive Office of the President (other than a special government employee) appointed by the President; (9) Members of Congress; and (10) congressional officers and employees. Section 7 Directs the Comptroller General to report to specified congressional committees on the role of political intelligence in the financial markets. Section 8 Requires the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, by August 31, 2012, or 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to ensure that financial disclosure forms filed by Members, candidates for Congress, and congressional officers and employees, in calendar year 2012 and in subsequent years be made available to the public on the respective official Senate and House websites within 30 days after filing. Terminates such requirement upon implementation of the following public disclosure systems. Directs the Secretary, the Sergeant at Arms, and the Clerk to develop systems to enable the electronic filing of such reports as well as their on- line public availability. Amends EGA to revise the retention period for mandatory public availability of financial disclosure reports. Requires retention and public availability of the financial disclosure reports of a Member of Congress until six years after the date the individual ceases to be a Member (currently, six years after receipt of the report). Section 9 Requires the OGE to issue interpretive guidance of the relevant federal ethics statutes and regulations, including the Standards of Ethical Conduct for executive branch employees, to specify that no such individual may use non- public information derived from his or her position or gained from the performance of official responsibilities as a means for making a private profit. Requires the U.S. Judicial Conference to issue interpretive guidance of similar ethics rules, including the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, applicable to: (1) federal judges, and (2) judicial employees. Declares that executive branch employees, judicial officers, and judicial employees are not exempt from the insider trading prohibitions arising under the securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to declare that such individuals owe a duty arising from a relationship of trust and confidence to the federal government and U.S. citizens with respect to material, nonpublic information derived from their positions as executive branch employees, judicial officers, or judicial employees gained from performance of the individual's official responsibilities. Section 11 Directs the President to ensure that financial disclosure forms filed in calendar year 2012 and in subsequent years by executive branch employees are publicly available on appropriate official websites of executive branch agencies within 30 days after such forms are filed. Requires the OGE Director to develop systems to enable electronic filing and public access to these financial disclosure forms. Section 12 Amends the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit individuals required to file financial disclosure reports under EGA from purchasing securities that are the subject of an initial public offering in any manner other than is available to members of the public generally. Section 13 Amends EGA to require the financial disclosure report of the following individuals to include any secured mortgage which is their personal residence or that of his or her spouse: (1) the President, the Vice President, Members of Congress; and (2) certain individuals nominated for appointments as executive branch officers or employees (except those nominated to positions as Foreign Service Officers or a grade or rank in the uniformed services with a pay grade of 0-6 or below). Section 14 Declares that the transaction reporting requirements established by this Act shall not be construed to apply to a widely held investment fund (whether a mutual fund, regulated investment company, pension or deferred compensation plan, or other investment fund): (1) if the fund is publicly traded or its assets are widely diversified, and (2) the reporting individual neither exercises control over nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held by the fund. Section 15 Denies Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) retirement benefits (other than a lump-sum reimbursement of personal contributions) to the President, the Vice President, or an elected official of a state or local government, if convicted of certain felonies. Section 16 Prohibits senior executives at the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (government-sponsored enterprises [GSEs]) from receiving bonuses during any period of conservatorship on or after the enactment of this Act. Section 17 Prohibits an individual required to file a financial disclosure report under EGA from directly negotiating or having any agreement of future employment or compensation without filing a signed disclosure statement, within three business days after commencement of the negotiation or agreement, with the individual's supervising ethics office. Requires such an individual to recuse himself or herself whenever there is or there appears to be a conflict of interest with respect to the subject matter of the statement. Requires the individual, upon such a recusal, to notify the supervising ethics office and submit the relevant disclosure statement. Section 18 Amends the federal criminal code to subject to a fine or imprisonment of up to 15 years, or both, as well as possible disqualification from holding federal office, certain covered government persons, in addition to Member of Congress and congressional employees, who with the intent to influence, on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity: (1) takes or withholds, or offers or threatens to take or withhold, an official act; or (2) influences, or offers or threatens to influence, the official act of another. Extends the meaning of \\"covered government person\\" (currently restricted to Members of Congress and congressional employees) to include the President, Vice President, an employee of the U.S. Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission, or any other executive branch employee. Section 19 Makes conforming amendments to EGA and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. Requires retention and public availability of the financial disclosure reports of Members of the House until six years after the date an individual ceases to be a Member of Congress (currently, six years after receipt of the report). == Reception == Barack Obama at Las Vegas Presidential Forum Overall the STOCK Act has garnered positive support from both houses of Congress. STOCK will effectively put an end to congressional insider trading. However, guarded optimism has been expressed by politicians such as Eric Weissmann. Weissman, a candidate for Congress in Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, recently claimed that STOCK was long overdue and that \\"The passage of the STOCK Act by both the House and Senate is a good first step in deterring these abusive practices, but doesn't go far enough to protect the American people from members of Congress who chose to act with self-interest over public good.\\" Other examples of positive support for STOCK include President Obama who upon signing the bill reassured that congressional members must play by the same rules as regular citizens. Obama regards the STOCK act as a way to monitor congressional activity and create transparency within the branch. He spoke to this point by adding, \\"It's the notion that the powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else. ... If we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials.\\" ==Amendment== The STOCK Act was modified on April 15, 2013, by S.716. This amendment modifies the online disclosure portion of the STOCK Act, so that some officials, but not the President, Vice President, Congress, or anyone running for Congress, can no longer file online and their records are no longer easily accessible to the public. In Section (a)2, the amendment specifically does not alter the online access for trades by the President, the Vice President, Congress, or those running for Congress. The reasoning for this change was to prevent criminals from gaining access to the financial data and using it against affected persons. This bill was introduced by Senator Harry Reid on April 11, 2013. It was considered by the Senate and passed by unanimous consent. In the house, S.716 received only 14 seconds of discussion before being passed by unanimous consent. The main provision that was repealed would have required about 28,000 senior government officials to post their financial information online, something that had been strongly criticized by federal government employee unions. A report by the National Academy of Public Administration, published in March 2013, said that the provision could threaten the safety of government employees abroad, as well as make it difficult to attract and retain public sector employees. The amendment also eliminated the requirement for the creation of searchable, sortable database of information in reports, and the requirement that reports be done in electronic format, rather than on paper. ==References *House Financial Disclosure Reports *Senate Financial Disclosure Reports Category:Acts of the 112th United States Congress ","title":"STOCK Act"},{"id":"35337637","text":"Dave Gunning is a Canadian folk singer-songwriter born in Pictou County, Nova Scotia.

Edendale was established in 1851, when 100 black Christian families settled on the farm Welverdiend, about 10 km from Pietermaritzburg, and renamed it to its present name. The village was laid out under the guidance of James Allison, who had broken with the Wesleyan Missionary Society in 1851. Unlike most black urban areas, Edendale was developed under private land ownership from the beginning, a concept that was new to Africans in Natal. This Christian community abandoned traditional beliefs and practices, moving away from polygamy and introducing men to cultivation, previously the realm of women. Edendale retained its primarily Christian character into the 1920s, but by the 1940s people from rural areas began to pour in, leading to overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.

It was fought on the south side of the Danube near its confluence with the river Bolia, in present-day Hungary. The Ostrogoths won, achieving supremacy in Pannonia, but soon migrated south towards richer lands. ==Background== Following the death of Attila, various Germanic and other tribes sought their independence from his empire. They allied under the command of Ardaric, the Gepid king, and defeated the Huns and supporting forces at the Battle of Nedao in 454 CE. While the role of the Ostragoths in that battle is unclear, it resulted in their independence as well. After the Battle of Nedao, the newly freed tribes jockeyed for supremacy in Pannonia for the next fifteen years, most eventually becoming federates of the Eastern Roman Empire. ==Battle== The Amal Goths were led by Theodemir, brother-in-law to the Ostrogoths' chief Valamir, who had been killed prior to the battle. The coalition included the Suevi under Hunimund, the Scirii under Hunulphus and Edicon (Edeko, Edica, Edika), the Sarmatians, the Gepids, the Rugians, and likely included the Heruli. The Roman Emperor Leo I supported the anti-Goth coalition, despite the advice of his general Aspar. Despite Valamir's death, the Ostrogoths won,While Jordanes, and most other authors, state that the Ostrogoths won, Kim states that they lost, apparently based upon the fact that they subsequently moved south further into the Roman Empire. and the battle marked the end of the Scirii as a separate people. ==Location== While some authorsFor example , originally published in 1982. have simply stated that the Bolia River remains unidentified; nonetheless, the Bolia was identified with the Ipeƒæ by the historian Ludwig Schmidt,This identification was made in 1934 in the second edition of his book on the eastern Germanic tribes. , and followed by Wolfram, as stated in his review by using the 1941 printing of Schmidt. and this identification continued to be followed by Wolfram, and several other modern authors, without further analysis. See authors cited at However, as √âmilienne pointed out such an identification would not place the battle in Pannonia. In order to fix that, Wolfram then suggested that the battle was across the Danube from the mouth of the Ipeƒæ at , which would have placed it near what is now the village of Pilismar√≥t, in present-day Hungary; however, that area is not a plain. As the battle is described as occurring in Pannonia on a plain,Jordanes Getica LIII (paragraph 278) some authors place it some sixty- five kilometers further west on the eastern side of the Little Hungarian Plain, which would make the Bolia River the Conc√≥ River, and place the battle near present day Cs√©m at . ==References== Category:469 Bolia Bolia Bolia ","title":"Battle of Bolia"},{"id":"35338151","text":"Y C McNease (born c. 1936) is a former American college football coach.

It tells the story of a man who pays a woman to spend several weeks with him by the sea to learn \\"how to love\\". ==Plot== The Malady of Death is about an unconventional sexual relationship between a man and a woman. The man hires the woman to stay with him in a hotel by the sea, hoping that by doing so, he will be able to experience love. The woman accepts the proposal even though she is not a prostitute. After some days, the woman tells him that he is incapable of love as he is afflicted with the \\"malady of death\\". The book is written in the second-person narrative; throughout the book, the man is referred to as \\"you\\", and the woman as \\"she\\". ==Genesis== Duras began to write the book in Trouville, where she drank six to seven litres of wine each day. When the first ten pages were finished she moved to Neauphle. She stopped eating but continued drinking; she began each morning by drinking two glasses which she vomited up, and was then able to keep the third. Duras had become incapable to write herself, so she recited lines while her muse Yann Andr√©a wrote them down for her. The manuscript had the development title \\"A scent of heliotrope and citron\\", but when it was 20 pages long Duras changed it to the final title. Eventually Duras agreed to go to a clinic for alcoholics, and on 21 October 1982, she was taken to the American Hospital of Paris. Upon returning from the clinic she immediately began to proofread the work. == Adaptations == Playwright Alice Birch adapted The Malady of Death for the stage under its French title, La Maladie de la Mort. The play premiered at the 2018 Edinburgh Fringe Festival and was directed by Katie Mitchell. The play was narrated in French by Ir√®ne Jacob and English subtitles were projected onscreen. Mitchell's production relied heavily on the use of live-feed greyscale images to give the audience a sense of dissociation. ==See also== * 1982 in literature * 20th-century French literature ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Category:1982 French novels Category:Novels by Marguerite Duras ","title":"The Malady of Death"},{"id":"35338610","text":"Qeynarjeh or Qeynarjah or Qinarjeh or Qainarjeh or Qaynarjeh (), also rendered as Qinarcheh and Qanizjeh, may refer to: *Qinarjeh, Ardabil *Qinarjeh-ye Olya, East Azerbaijan Province *Qinarjeh-ye Sofla, East Azerbaijan Province *Qinarjeh, Maragheh, East Azerbaijan Province *Qeynarjeh, Hamadan *Qinarjeh, Kurdistan *Qeynarjeh, Qazvin *Qinarjeh, Shahin Dezh, West Azerbaijan Province *Qinarjeh, Takab, West Azerbaijan Province *Qinarjeh, Zanjan *Qeynarjeh, Khodabandeh ==See also== *Gheynarjeh ","title":"Qeynarjeh"},{"id":"35338633","text":"Qeynar (; also known as KenyƒÅr, Keynar, KinƒÅr, and Qanƒ´r) is a village in Bonab Rural District, in the Central District of Marand County, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

It is produced by Titmouse, Inc. and Disney Television Animation. The series ran from April 30, 2012 to January 7, 2013 on Disney XD. On November 5, 2012, the series was cancelled after one season. ==Synopsis== This show occurs in a fictitious futuristic Detroit, which is an elevated metropolis built over the old Detroit, classified as Detroit Deluxe. It is owned by evil billionaire Abraham Kane (Mark Hamill). Ruling the citizens under strict laws, and banning personal freedoms including automobile transportation, Kane now faces one last obstacle: a group of hot-rod wielding rebels who call themselves the Burners. Led by Kane's former cadet Mike Chilton (Reid Scott), the Burners rise to stop Kane from conquering Detroit's last oasis of freedom‚Äîan underground refuge dubbed Motorcity. ==Characters== Protagonists The Burners * Mike Chilton (voiced by Reid Scott) ‚Äì The leader of the Burners and the main protagonist of the series. Mike is a cool, quick-witted, funny, gutsy, kind, impulsive 17-year-old who does things his own way and usually has things under control. He takes very few things seriously, except for his mission of taking down Kane, and easily keeps his team ready for whatever Kane throws their way. He used to work as Kane's cadet before Kane's cruel nature drove him to quit and fight against him as a Motorcity rebel. * Julie Kane (voiced by Kate Micucci) ‚Äì The Burners' infiltration expert and inside connection to KaneCo., using her \\"internship\\" there to gather info on Kane's plots. She is highly skilled and has a strong sense of patience that allows her to see the best in people. Unknown to her Burner teammates, she is actually Kane's daughter, though she makes it no secret that she is against her father's wicked crusade. * Chuck (voiced by Nate Torrence) ‚Äì Mike's best friend and computer expert for the Burners. Thanks to his large brain, Chuck can always find an escape route or solution to whatever problem the Burners are in, and is usually improving the Burners' computer and security systems. Although he's usually terrified of whatever dangerous situation Mike has put him in, he's incredibly loyal. He's the only Burner who can't drive, and fears rejection from the others if they ever found out. * Dutch Gordy (voiced by Kel Mitchell) ‚Äì The Burners' creative technological genius. Having escaped Kane's futuristic empire, Dutch is wary of Deluxe and hates to go back, even to fight Kane. He is initially mistrustful of others, but is likable after getting to know him and his knowledge and loyalty makes him a steadfast teammate. Dutch is an artist at heart and values solitude when pursuing his passion, but he's always ready to upgrade the Burners' hot rods with one of his latest weapons or gadgetry. * Texas (voiced by Jess Harnell) ‚Äì Loveable yet somewhat stupid, Texas is a violent, gung-ho powder keg who is dedicated to the Burners and his fierce determination usually makes him the first one on the battlefield when a fight breaks out. Texas is never the voice of dissent and tends not to think twice before charging in and smashing something with any body part that's armed and ready. He is noted to be Mike's self-appointed second-in-command and dreams of one day leading the Burners, but would never question Mike's authority without a reason. He often speaks in 3rd person and yells his name when attacking foes. * Jacob (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray) ‚Äì A hippie type in his mid-60s and Kane's former partner (a relationship that ended when Kane got all megalomaniacal). He's full of scientific and technological knowledge, which is often buried under organic food talk. * R.O.T.H. ‚Äì Dutch's cube-shaped robot assistant who has helped the team on a number of occasions. He was one of Kane's attack bots until Dutch reprogrammed him as his helper. He has been shown to have a phobia of metal-destroying things, like miniature robots that disintegrate metal. Allies * Claire (voiced by Dana Davis) ‚Äì Julie's best friend and confidant for her dual identities. Claire is a sort of \\"valley-girl\\" who lives in Deluxe and has shown to be uncomfortable in the slums of Motorcity, considering it 'weird' and 'scary'. As of her second appearance, she states Chuck is the least weirdest thing about the Burners. * Dr. Hudson (voiced by Jim Cummings) ‚Äì A scientist who was Jacob's student when KaneCo was trying to help people. He stayed while Jacob left when Kane started pushing them into more \\"dangerous\\" experiments. After being rescued by the Burners and making amends with Jacob, Hudson now assumedly assists them in his new lab in Motorcity. * Rayon (voiced by Bumper Robinson) ‚Äì The Leader of a gang called the Skylarks, the owner of the Skylark Motel and a regular client of the Burners. Rayon believes The Burners (Especially Mike) to be his allies and trust them much more than some of the other gangs in Motorcity. He is always willing to give Mike information or help when it does not interfere with his business. * Darr Gordy (voiced by Roshon Fegan) ‚Äì Dutch's brother and new cadet to Kane. At first he planned on turning in the Burners, but after seeing Dutch save some Deluxians he reconsidered and was made a Burner...technically. He is now another inside connection to Kane. * Tennie (voiced by Aimee Garcia) ‚Äì An engineer and love interest of Dutch. She, her father, Bracket (Voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) and the Burners worked together to defend her home against Kane's bots. * Foxy (voiced by Jennifer Hale) ‚Äì The Leader of the Amazons, an all girl gang in Motorcity that specializes in fast and high tech vehicles that resemble Formula One Cars. She is somewhat distrusting of the Burners but becomes more of an ally after befriending Claire even helping save them from the Duke. Antagonists * Abraham Kane (voiced by Mark Hamill) ‚Äì The billionaire owner of Detroit Deluxe who serves as the main antagonist of the series. Kane is a wicked, megalomaniac industrialist who was responsible for building the new Detroit called Detroit Deluxe atop the old one, now named Motorcity. He is determined to take over all of Detroit, and plans to do so by wiping out the Motorcity population. People should never forget he absolutely loves his job. He has no regard for the citizens of Motorcity, shown as to go so far as to demolish a building with people inside. ** Tooley (voiced by Jim Breuer) ‚Äì Kane's dimwitted right- hand man. What Tooley lacks in competence or intelligence, he makes up for in strength, blind loyalty, and devotion to Kane and his agenda. He also appears to have a crush on Julie which she will at times exploit to gain information from him to assist the Burners. * Kaia (voiced by Laraine Newman) ‚Äì The leader of an eco-friendly resistance group called \\"Terra\\" who live in a village outside Detroit that was destroyed by KaneCo's waste dumping and fight using rapidly growing mutant plants as their weapons to take revenge on Kane as well as the Deluxe population. As a side effect of the dumping, the Terra themselves had been mutated and are forced to conceal their appearances behind gas masks and headbands. While allied at first, Kaia and her followers are now enemies of the Burners, primarily because of the Terra's attack on innocent Deluxe citizens. * The Duke of Detroit (voiced by Dee Snider) ‚Äì Sometimes friend, sometimes enemy, the Duke is a self-absorbed collector and lover of cars who owns a palace filled with guards and mint condition automobiles. He instructs Mike that respect is conveyed through actions, and when Mike doesn't issue the Duke's kind of respect, he plots to take Mike's car Mutt as a means of payback. The Duke has occasionally put the Burners' rides (and lives) at stake simply for his and others entertainment, going as far as putting the Burners' in a combat situation while they transported a large container with unstable chemicals with the safety mechanisms of said container compromised as part of a reality show staged by him. ** #2 (voiced by Tara Strong) ‚Äì The Duke's Number 2, Not much is known about her except for the fact that she is extremely devoted to him and is very involved with his plans. She speaks with a New York accent and is always chewing bubble gum. ** Cyborg Dan (voiced by Dave Wittenberg) ‚Äì A robot who works for The Duke. He seems to be very high up in the Duke's organization but his rank or how he became involved with the Duke is not known. The Duke used him to demonstrate a nuclear reactor for the burners resulting in his face being melted off. He blames Mike for this despite it having almost nothing to do with him. * Red (voiced by Eric Ladin) ‚Äì A ghost from Mike's past who was indirectly responsible for Mike coming down to Motorcity. A year ago, he lived in a supposedly abandoned building complex until it was destroyed by an attack from KaneCo. led by Mike. Though Mike betrayed Kane, fought his own men, and rescued the people, he still blames Mike for leading the attack to begin with. He spent the next year training, forging armor, and plotting revenge against Mike; after losing against him, Red joined with Kane and serves as an elite soldier of his, now with upgrades to his suit and weaponry. ==Cars== * Mutt ‚Äì Mike and Chuck's retrofitted green '70s muscle car with four turbine tri-pulsor engines, a slew of energy weapons, a grip of gadgets and a 21st-century chopper hidden between the exhaust pipes. * 9 Lives ‚Äì Julie's modified yellow mid 21st century police cruiser. Her car can produce decoy hologram-cars to throw pursuers off her trail, cloak to near invisibility, and deploy smoke screens, oil slicks and electromagnetic pulse mines. 9 Lives also has a high precision Sniper Beam under the hood. * Stronghorn ‚Äì Texas' black and red six-wheeled race car that is cobbled from the best late 20th century Italian sports cars. Stronghorn is equipped with massive air-powered battering pistons, ram plates and hydro drills. Relies on physical weapons such as a roof-mounted grappling hook and the battering ram which is revealed by splitting open the front grille. * Whiptail ‚Äì Dutch's white and purple mid 21st century hot rod that's in a constant state of modification. Dutch is switching the color and welding new things onto it all the time. The speakers incorporated into Whiptail's body can transform into its \\"sonic spitter\\", that can shatter armor plating with ear-splitting sound waves. It has also been seen that Whiptail carries ROTH who helps with the car mods and field repairs. Whiptail was destroyed during an attack by KaneBots in the episode \\"The Duke of Detroit\\", but it was subsequently rebuilt. * Blonde Thunder ‚Äì Chuck's blue seldom-driven, custom- built sports coupe, which was in a state of disrepair until his friends souped it up for a race against the Duke. Unlike the other Burners' vehicles, Blonde Thunder does not have any known weapons or additional equipment, except for a turbo boost. It is unknown if Chuck will ever drive it again. * Sasquatch ‚Äì Jacob's blue 20th century chop top, jacked up on monster truck tires with a modified tow truck bed for a rear end. *The Duke's Limos ‚Äì The Duke of Detroit's limos are old fashioned cars that are stretched out to become limos. However, his primary means of transportation, a monstrosity that drives on massive tank treads, is so large that it fires stretch limos as ammunition. *The Red Car ‚Äì Red's car which is equipped with smoke bombs, a harpoon and machine guns, as well that Red is very good with car tricks, such as disappearing acts and jumping behind a car behind him. After joining with Kane, Red's car was rebuilt with Deluxian technology, specifically the kind used to build the Enforcer drones, allowing it to shoot powerful lasers and hover rather than ride on normal wheels. ==Places== * Motorcity ‚Äì An underground refuge, consisting of what is left of Old Detroit, that the Burners are protecting. * North, East, West and South side gates ‚Äì These gateways are the only way up into Detroit Deluxe from Motorcity. * Detroit Deluxe ‚Äì This futuristic city is built on a giant platform that completely covers Old Detroit and the area that surrounds it, and it had the personal freedom of its citizens taken away, but almost nobody living there realizes it. It is most likely to have stemmed from Metro Detroit, spreading across part of southern Michigan. * The Detroit Doom Jump ‚Äì This jump has never been made because people regret going on it, then panic and slow down causing them to fall and die. * Lake Erie ‚Äì The Burners modified the shore line into a theme park. * The Burners' Garage ‚Äì The Burners HQ. It has all of the necessary equipment needed to complete a job or raise a kid. * The Terra's Village ‚Äì The home of the Terras. It was once a beautiful and fertile environment until the dumped waste from KaneCo mutated all life there. It is now filled with enormous mushrooms and spores the Terras use for their weapons. * The Duke's Mansion ‚Äì A overly large manor that sits atop a hill over a junkyard. It has an obstacle course somewhere nearby. ==Revival== On April 29, 2013 crew member George Krstic posted a tweet that the studio Titmouse, Inc. was having a meeting on bringing back Motorcity and Megas XLR. Thus far, no meeting nor idea was confirmed. ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFF;\\" - ! FF8C00; color:#000; text-align:center;\\"No. !!

The route consists of almost of the former Great Central Railway Main Line from Loughborough South Junction (with the Midland Main Line) to Fifty Steps Bridge and the site of Ruddington's former GCR station, plus a branch line from Fifty Steps Bridge to Ruddington Fields station which is located on a former Ministry of Defence site next to Rushcliffe Country Park. There are stations open to the public at Ruddington Fields (within the main centre site) and at Rushcliffe Halt. The GCR(N) aim to re-open the former station at East Leake in the longer term. The railway is currently not connected to Great Central Railway (at Loughborough Central in Leicestershire), although there are plans well underway and work has started to reunite the two preserved lines. This is a major engineering project that is expected to be completed during 2024 - 2028. Some of the line is used by gypsum trains serving the British Gypsum works at East Leake. == Preservation history == After the major part of the GCR main line was closed by British Rail in 1968, a section from Nottingham to Rugby was retained until 1976. Preservationists had hoped to convert that into a live heritage line, but funding was impossible to obtain ‚Äî except for the length from Loughborough to Belgrave and Birstall, north of Leicester. British Rail decided to maintain rail connection from Loughborough to Ruddington MoD depot until closure and the GCR main line became an unsignalled BR single-track branch. When the Ministry of Defence depot at Ruddington was closed, the of track from East Leake to Ruddington was no longer needed by BR. It was also considered that British Gypsum was unlikely to bring in any more bulk materials from coal- fired power stations by rail. The GCR Northern Development Association was formed with the aim of reconnecting the then two GCR sections once again. Work initially concentrated on restoring Rushcliffe Halt, but when Nottinghamshire County Council, which had acquired the whole of the 220 acre MoD site, agreed to lease 12 acres of the former MOD site to the Association, the grand scheme of the Nottingham Transport Heritage Centre was devised to encompass not only railway preservation but any transport heritage relevant to the area. In the 1990s, work on what had become the Great Central Railway (Nottingham) Ltd was concentrated mainly at Ruddington. The transfer of former BR property to Railtrack and then Network Rail hindered attempts to purchase the line. Ironically, it was British Gypsum's intention to renew rail freight traffic that was the catalyst that allowed the GCR(N) to buy the line and restore it initially for freight use. At East Leake station, houses were built on the former goods yard in the 1980s and some were built only yards from the remaining track. The disused nature of the line combined with a solicitor's error led the new occupants to believe that the line was closed, but BR had never listed the line as closed and could have resumed operations at any time. However, when the GCR(N) applied for a Transport and Works Act 1992 Order to purchase and operate the line, objections from local residents resulted in a permanent limit on hours of passenger train operation through the former East Leake Station and the station remaining closed. For Network Rail to route freight trains onto the line during the week and GCR(N) to operate heritage trains at the weekend, a length of rail north of East Leake was removed to create two separate railways. However, because of the 'rail break', the GCR(N) were unable to access Rushcliffe Halt. This has now been updated with an alternative system of work. Despite the full line between Loughborough South Jn and Ruddington being owned by the GCN(N), when the GCR(N) require to operate trains into East Leake or through to Loughborough, possession of the line is taken from Network Rail. Network Rail then lock the line out of use from their end allowing GCR(N) operation through to Loughborough. In 2003, regular services to Rushcliffe Halt resumed. Passenger trains further south now run on a regular basis to \\"Loughborough High Level\\", although no station facilities exist here. == The railway route == Ruddington Fields is the main station on the line and the home of the Great Central Railway (Nottingham). It features a road transport building, locomotive sheds, GCR signal box (ex Neasden), miniature and model railways, cafe, visitor centre, toilets and car park. The Rushcliffe Country Park, created over the balance of the ex MoD site, surrounds the GCRN facilities here. In 2009, a new platform was opened and a second platform is currently part way through construction. 9389 is pushed past Asher Lane crossing by 56 The gated Asher Lane Crossing is on a private road which was formerly the MOD depot perimeter road. It is a short walk from the Country Park to the crossing, where it is possible to see trains passing and the crossing keeper at work. There was a set of sidings here, called Asher Lane Exchange Sidings, but they have since been removed. Fifty Steps Bridge is the end of the spur from Ruddington Fields, known as Ruddington South Junction, where trains reverse for the onward journey to Loughborough. The bridge itself originally had 'Fifty Steps' but subsequent modifications have increased that number. The former Ruddington station is further north and, following the reunification of the two halves of the preserved GCR, could see improvements made to aid towards eventual reopening, the trackbed being owned by the charity, East Midlands Railway Trust, to support the eventual extension of the line. The Gotham branch-line was a short, freight branch connected to the Great Central Mainline via Gotham Sidings; it was lifted in 1969. The branch originally served a gypsum mine which was located on the north-western side of the village of Gotham. The sidings will be reinstated along with a short section of the branch line following reunification as part of a project to double-track the Nottingham section of the GCR. Trains pass across wide open countryside at Gotham Moor, which has much wildlife, and the line passes under a few bridges. Rushcliffe Halt Station looking north towards Ruddington Rushcliffe Halt railway station is named after the nearby \\"Rushcliffe Golf Club\\". Station development is ongoing with a new footbridge being prepared to replace the original which was dismantled. Just next to the station at Hotchley Hill is the British Gypsum works. On weekdays, trainloads of gypsum are delivered to the works and unloaded on the concrete pad visible from the station platforms. An Art Deco LNER signal box (Hotchley Hill) replaced the original GCR structure in the late 1940s when the sidings were extended. The original station near the centre of the village of East Leake is currently disused and exists only as an island platform with the stairwell of the station's subway bricked up. There are long term aspirations to reopen the station but would required the Light Railway Order under which the railway operates to be amended to allow this. This would provide the community with a station once again (and ties in with the local Parish Plan in that respect), as well as a potential home for the thriving East Leake Historical Society. Visitors to the area arriving on the railway would also be able to visit the local pubs and restaurants. Stanford Viaduct Barnstone Tunnel (which is 98 yards long) is the only tunnel on the preserved line. It was built by the Victorian navvies and was dug out by hand. Located close to the tunnel was another set of sidings, which although removed could be reinstated in the future for extra storage. Between that Tunnel and Loughborough the line follows the ridge forming the Eastern side of the Soar Valley. The railway continues towards Loughborough, passing close to the hamlet of Stanford-on-Soar. The line travels over the River Soar at Stanford Viaduct, close to the Brush works, now part of WABTEC. GCRN services currently terminate at a Stop Board close to the A60 road. Beyond that is the connection to Network Rail and the Midland Main Line (MML) at Loughborough South Junction. The loco sheds of the Great Central Railway at Loughborough are just visible across the MML, about away. Plans are under way reconnect the two halves of the preserved GCR with the new bridge across the MML now completed and fundraising for the next stage underway. Once the two preserved sections are re-connected (with the bridging of the Loughborough Gap of 500 metres, three bridges and a 400m embankment), this would extend to a total of over in length.Steam track could run for from Nottinghamshire to LeicestershireCentral Railway link appeal raises ¬£100,000 Since then GCR is seeking some ¬£7 million of which ¬£1 million has been raised by donors so far. == Railway collection == City of Truro, leaves 50 steps junction with a December 2010 Santa Special Service The railway operates classic steam / diesel hauled services to Rushcliffe Halt and Loughborough. Most trains are steam-hauled, but the resident classic heritage diesel collection is one of the best in the Midlands. GC Railway (Nottingham) operate every Sunday and Bank Holiday Mondays from Easter through to October, and also Saturdays during school holidays, and during December ('Santa Specials' during weekends before Christmas and on Christmas Eve, and post Christmas services on 27/28 December). As well as regular services, GCRN also operate a host of Special Events and 'Gala' days. There are 7 steam locomotives permanently based at the railway, 6 of them being of industrial origin, 4 of these being locomotives which once worked at Stewarts & Lloyds at Corby, Northamptonshire. The line has also hosted locomotives of BR/Big 4 pedigree, notable examples in recent years being GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro, LBSCR Terrier 662 \\"Martello\\" and LNER O4 63601 and currently is home to a Stanier 8F 2-8-0.

He was s√Ωsluma√∞ur in the Westfjords in 1544 and lived at first at N√∫pur. He was hir√∞stj√≥ri 1551-53 and Lawspeaker for the south and east until 1556, and for the north and west 1556‚Äì68, after which he was a s√Ωsluma√∞ur and steward of the land of Helgafellsklaustur. Eggert was the richest man in Iceland of his time, and indeed the most powerful. Among his manuscripts was the celebrated Eggertsb√≥k (Rekjav√≠k, Stofnun √Årna Magn√∫ssonar, AM 556a-b 4to), which contains the earliest surviving text of G√≠sla saga. On one occasion while Eggert lived at Saurb√¶r, he was seized by English pirates and held for a whole month on board their ship until a high ransom was paid. In 1580 Eggert moved to Hamburg, where he died. Eggert's first wife was Sesselja J√≥nsd√≥ttir; he later married Steinunn J√≥nsd√≥ttir. == References  * R√≠kasti ma√∞ur √çslands; article in L√∂gberg 1941 Category:16th-century Icelandic people ","title":"Eggert Hannesson"},{"id":"35338966","text":"thumb Josef Klapuch (1906 - 1985) was a Czechoslovak wrestler.

It is one of the first Cartoon Network original shows to be created for the network. ==Plot== Kris is an intelligent and naughty kid who stays at an Orphanage School along with his friends - Pinky and Bablu. An evil demon king, posing as principal Kanishk is out to create havoc in the school. He has ulterior motives to take over the world with his army of zombie demons. To save his friends and school from annihilation, Kris prays to Lord Krishna and is blessed with super powers. Armed with a magical peacock feather and a flute, Kris is ready to take on the evil demon king - Kanishk! == Characters == *Kris: Kris is a godly child mostly known as Neela Bandar by his friends, an incarnation of Lord Krishna . He has appeared in Mathura Anath Ashram to stop Kanishk and his evil plans. Kris stays as a normal student in the school but secretly changes into Krishna, the divine boy with mystical powers whenever it is needed. He shows childish traits such as playing, disliking studies and homework and enjoying playtime with his friends. Like Lord Krishna, Kris also likes butter. His skin colour is blue (like Lord Krishna) in this series. He has a crush on Pinky. *Kanishk: Kanishk is the incarnation of Kansa who is the principal of Mathura Anath Ashram. He initially came back on earth to take over the world but Krishna's appearance is 'delaying' his whole plan. He is king of demons of Paataal-Lok. In order to get rid of Kris, He keeps coming with a new 'Get Kris' plan in each story which forms the storyline for the series. However, since defeating Kris is not easy, and he also has to manage the whole school and its duties, Kanishk keeps summoning various demons from Paataal Lok to fight Kris. Kanishk is very concerned about the performance of his school and its result. He is seen constantly nagging with his staff to get the kids' performance up all the time. *Doctor J: Doctor J is Kanishk's most loyal minion. He is a dentist and stays by Kanishk all the time. He is the reincarnation of Jarasandh. J often keeps coming with new ideas to get rid of Kris. Unfortunately, all his ideas backfire on him and Kanishk. Besides being a dentist, Dr. J is also a scientist who keeps inventing various machines, devices and traps mostly used to tackle Kris. However, he often desires to be the principal of the school and hopes to kick Kanishk out because Kanishk keeps whacking and humiliating him. *Pinky: Pinky is Kris' classmate and a student of Mathura Anath Ashram. She is the incarnation of Radha. She is one of the best friends that Kris has and worries about Kris, her friends and the school. She is an activist who keeps coming up with different initiatives for the betterment of the school and its students. Pinky is also a brainiac who is good with studies. She appears to have a crush on Kris, but she does not show it out to him and only behaves as his friend. *Babloo: Babloo is Kris' best friend and the reincarnation of Sudama. He stays with Kris most of the time and backs Kris and his ideas when confronted by Pinky. He is an average student but really good with sports. *Madhu: Madhu is a friend of Kris and the brains of their group. Among all the friends Kris has, Madhu is the smartest one. He keeps coming up with many innovative ideas of gadgets and devices useful for kids. He is also the smartest student of the school. He often gets bullied by Golu. He is reincarnation of Madhukumar (a friend of Lord Krishna). *Golu: Golu is the bully of Mathura Anath Ashram. His only job and recreation is to mess with the kids (especially Madhu) and to take their stuff by force. He is often confronted by Kris and friends. Many times, Golu is let in by Kanishk and J in their plans to get back at Kris. Golu happily participates in Kanishk's plans as he likes getting an opportunity to get even with Kris and Kanishk also manages to get Golu's grades a little high. He is reincarnation of Mangal (a friend of Lord Krishna). *Sukhi: Sukhi is the reincarnation of Muni Narada in the school. He is in the school to report everything to the gods. He owns a phone booth outside the school, where he has a divine phone which connects straight to heaven. He reports about how Kris is doing through this booth. He knows Kris' secret and helps him often by letting him know of Kanishk's evil plans. *Taarak: Taarak, an incarnation of Tarakasur, is Kanishk's cousin who is there in the school as a maths teacher. He is more of a 'Yes Sir' character who keeps nodding to all of Kanishk's plans to get back at Kris (no matter how ridiculous they are). He sometimes is shown wishing if Kanishk could let him be a fit free as he is constantly nagged by Kanishk to take more extra classes. *Suparna: Miss Suparna is the chemistry teacher of the school. She is the reincarnation of Putana. She is really fond of make-up and is a laid back but strict teacher. *Basu: Basu is the sports teacher of the Mathura Anath Ashram. He is loved by the kids and is their favorite teacher. He is the incarnation of Vasudeva and is the only human teacher, unlike the other teachers who are demons. *Prashanth: He is a student in Mathura Anath Ashram. He is somewhat good in studies but very good at sport and dancing.He is reincarnation of Uddhav (a friend of Lord Krishna). *Balu: He is the elder brother of Kris and the incarnation of Balarama. In his first scene in the show, he is seen keeping a public eye on Kris. He is also seen being over-protective of Kris. *Chimpu and Champu : They are the two sidekicks of Golu. *Guru Mahasur: He is teacher of all demons of Paatal Lok. He is incarnation of Guru Shukracharya. *Lord Aquarius: He is the overarching villain and is shown to be the strongest devil.

They finished in fourth place on the second season of the CMT series Can You Duet in 2009. Their self-titled debut album was released by EMI Music Canada in September 2011. The first single was a cover of the Fairground Attraction's song \\"Perfect\\". In July 2014, the duo released \\"Gravy\\", which doubles as the first single off their second album. An Irish rock and roll showband http://www.irishshowbands.net/bgstellas.htm by the same name was active in the sixties releasing a single covering Wooly Bully and \\"Fortune Teller\\". ==Personal life== Brad and MaryLynne met when they were age 20. The married couple has been together for sixteen years playing in bands and writing country pop music. Brad played bass in rock bands for years, but was drawn to writing country. MaryLynne had never written songs until she met Brad. She grew up one of eight kids, which her late father supported as a musician (he was once a member of The Platters). MaryLynne and Brad both performed in cover bands and hosted a weekly open mic where they eventually became a musical duo. The couple also opened a 15,000-square-foot music school, The Music Scene, which included a stage and auditorium.\\"Music Scene owners turn heads in Nashville\\". Mar 25, 2008 Oshawa This Week Brad and MaryLynne have two daughters, Lennon & Maisy, who are known for their roles on the ABC show Nashville. ==Career== In 2009, The Stellas tried out for the U.S. show Can You Duet, performing songs by Paul McCartney and Cyndi Lauper. Following their audition for the Country Music Television show, The Stellas performed weekly for millions of American viewers and earned fourth place in the competition. This led fellow Canadian and multi-platinum artist, Johnny Reid, to offer The Stellas the opening slot on his sold-out Canadian tour. Eventually, Brad and MaryLynne inked a deal with EMI Music Canada. In 2012, they released their self-titled album, which was produced by Britain‚Äôs Nick Trevisick (Paramore, Katy Perry, Sting). The Stellas wrote most of the songs on their 10-track self-titled debut album, except for a cover of Fairground Attraction's ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù and a live version of Boudleaux Bryant's ‚ÄúLove Hurts‚Äù. Collaborations on the album include Trevisick on ‚ÄúTake It Slow‚Äù, Pistol Annies‚Äô Angaleena Presley on ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Listen to Love Songs‚Äù and multi-platinum Nashville songwriter John Scott Sherrill (Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson) on ‚ÄúWished for You‚Äù. The Stellas were featured on volume 6 and volume 7 of the Now Country Canada albums. They are one of the two Canadian acts featured on those albums. They are also featured on The Best of Now Country Canada album that came out in May 2014. The Stellas have supported multiple sold out tours with Zac Brown Band. Zac Brown recorded and released a song called \\"Let It Rain\\" that he wrote with Brad for his EP The Grohl Sessions, Vol. 1 (released in 2013). It is the only song on that album that Dave Grohl plays drums on. In July 2014, The Stellas released \\"Gravy\\", a blend of twang and tongue-in-cheek humor that doubles as the first single from the duo's second album. Fred Wilhelm, who helped The Stellas write \\"Gravy\\", co-wrote several other songs, including a track called \\"It Wouldn't Be This\\". ==Awards== The Stellas have been nominated for eleven awards. They won the 2013 CCMA Group or Duo of the Year award, the 2013 CMAO Group or Duo of the Year award and the 2012 CCMA Video of the Year award.

This tradition of gypsy jazz was started by the Wasso Gr√ºnholz, who was an inspiration and the primary teacher for the Sinti guitar players.Dregni, Michael (2008) Gypsy Jazz In Search of Django Reinhardt and the Soul of Gypsy Swing pp. 228.

His first real fame came when Paulus briefly took over the lead guitar in the Gipsy Kids when Jimmy Rosenberg left the group. He formed the Paulus Sch√§fer Gipsy Band with rhythm guitarist Sendelo Sch√§fer, bassist Jozua Rosenberg and violinist Martien Wagner in 2001. They recorded their debut album \\"Into the Light\\" the year after that. Soon after the release of this album Jozua Rosenberg left the group to be able to concentrate more on playing flamenco guitar and Rinus Steinbach, who played bass with Jimmy Rosenberg in Gipsy Kids and Sinti stepped in to fill the gap. In 2006, while recording the next album Desert Fire, Noah Schafer replaced bassist Rinus Steinbach. Paulus Sch√§fer performed at many prestigious venues: DjangoFest NorthWest, Langley WA (US), Django in June, Northampton, MA (US), Sziget Festival Budapest (H), Khamoro Prague (CZ), International Gipsy Guitar Festival Gossington (UK), Django Reinhardt Festival Samois-sur-Seine (FR), Gipsy Festival Anger (FR), and the International Gipsyfestival (NL). ==Discography== * Twelfth Year (Moncq, 2012) * Rock Django with Tim Kliphuis (Lowland, 2012) * Letter to Van Gogh (Sinti Music, 2015) ==See also== *Django Reinhardt *Dutch jazz *Gypsy jazz *List of jazz guitarists *Romani people *Sinti ==References * Official site Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:Dutch jazz guitarists Category:Gypsy jazz guitarists Category:People from Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten Category:Dutch Sinti people Category:Romani guitarists Category:21st-century guitarists ","title":"Paulus Sch√§fer"},{"id":"35339364","text":"Sir John Wentworth Loring, KCB, KCH (13 October 1775 - 29 July 1852) was a Royal Navy officer of the early nineteenth century who is best known for his service in the Napoleonic Wars as a frigate commander. Born in the Thirteen Colonies at the outbreak of the American War of Independence, Loring's family fled to Britain and he subsequently joined the Royal Navy aged 13. In 1793, aged 17, Loring was badly wounded in combat at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars. He subsequently served throughout the following 23 years of warfare between Britain and France, achieving success in command of the frigate HMS Niobe. After the war he served in an influential position at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth and eventually became a full admiral. ==Life== John Loring was born in October 1775 at the start of the American War of Independence to Joshua Loring, High Sheriff of Massachusetts. John's grandfather, Joshua Loring, had served in the navy in the Seven Years' War, commanding a squadron on the Great Lakes. The Loring family were Loyalists, and were ultimately forced to flee to Britain. In 1789, 13-year-old John Loring joined the Royal Navy, serving in HMS Salisbury before joining HMS Victory at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Loring was badly wounded early in the conflict at the Siege of Toulon, but in 1794 was in independent command of a gunboat at the Siege of Bastia and later served in the sloop HMS Fleche before joining Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's flagship HMS St George, seeing combat at the Battle of Genoa and the Battle of Hy√®res Islands in 1795. In 1796, Loring served in HMS Britannia before joining HMS Comet in the West Indies. Over the next five years, Loring commanded a succession of ships, including HMS Rattler, HMS Lark, HMS Abergavenny and HMS Syren, operating against French privateers with some success and subduing a mutiny in his last command. For this service he was promoted to post captain by Rear- Admiral John Thomas Duckworth. Following the Peace of Amiens, Loring took command of HMS Utrecht. He subsequently returned to Europe, and was eventually given command of HMS Niobe in the blockade of France. Loring served in Niobe for eight years, capturing numerous French merchant vessels and small warships. Two particularly notable exploits were the destruction of French frigates at the Action of 13 November 1810 and the Action of 24 March 1811. He finished the war as captain of HMS Impregnable, the flagship of the North Sea fleet. In 1816, Loring was superintendent of the ordinary (or reserve) at Sheerness and in 1819 he became lieutenant governor of the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth. He held this latter position for 18 years. Retiring in 1837 a rear-admiral, Loring was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and in 1840 a Knight Commander of the Bath, having been a Companion of the Order of the Bath since 1815. He was also promoted, becoming a vice- admiral in 1846 and a full admiral in 1851. Loring had married, in 1804, Anna Patton, daughter of Vice-Admiral Philip Patton. They had two sons, including William Loring who later also became an admiral, and three daughters. Loring died at his estate in Ryde, Isle of Wight in July 1852.Loring, Sir John Wentworth, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, (subscription required), Retrieved 19 April 2012 He also lived at Peartree House, near Peartree Green, Southampton from 1842 until his death. ==Ship== The British Navy ship HMS Loring (K565) was named after him. ==ReferencesSee also== * Category:1775 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"John Wentworth Loring"},{"id":"35339395","text":"Maturin Le Petit (1693‚Äì1739)Margaret Mead, Ruth Leah Bunzel [The golden age of American anthropology] 1960 - 630 pages was a Jesuit priest sent among the Choctaws in 1726 and to observe the Natchez in 1730Robert Wright [The evolution of God] - 2009 - 567 pages in an area of what became part of Mississippi.

The concert featured symphonic arrangements found in some of Nintendo's biggest game series, such as Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Pikmin, F-Zero and Donkey Kong. The concert was produced and directed by Thomas B√∂cker, with arrangements provided by Finnish composers and musicians Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, as well as Japanese game music composers Masashi Hamauzu, Hayato Matsuo, Shiro Hamaguchi and German film composer Torsten Rasch. Like the previous concerts performed by the WDR, Symphonic Legends was broadcast over radio, now in 5.1 surround sound, on the WDR4 station and was also broadcast online via live video streaming. ==Concert== Production After the continued success of Symphonic Fantasies, Merregnon Studios and the WDR ambitiously announced their plans to follow up and work together once again on a new concert. On 17 December 2009, it was announced that another concert would take place in 2010 on Symphonic Fantasies website. No theme was announced for the concert until March 2010, when Winfried Fechner announced that the theme would exclusively focus on the Japanese game developer Nintendo. Thomas B√∂cker further added soon thereafter that the concert was to take concept he had built the previous shows on even further, and experiment extensively to push the perception of video game music arrangement more than ever before. Symphonic Legends was said to present many innovations to orchestral video game performances due to this approach. B√∂cker requested that arrangers would need total freedom with their work, which Nintendo permitted. The concert was to be structured in a way that each game‚Äôs story was told, rather than just themes being performed and pieces placed in an order to maximize their impact. Thorsten Rasch was brought in to provide an arrangement for Super Metroid done in a dark, contemporary style as opposed to the more classically textured arrangement during past shows. Masashi Hamauzu commented that he had total freedom to arrange \\"Aquatic Ambiance\\" from Donkey Kong Country, and therefore could put all his skills into the arrangement. Roger Wanamo, who assisted in the prior year‚Äôs concert Symphonic Fantasies, was given a more prominent role for Symphonic Legends, arranging the Super Mario Bros \\"Retro Suite\\" and the Super Mario Galaxy \\"Galactic Suite\\". For the \\"Retro Suite\\", Wanamo remarked that the purpose was to properly represent the spirit of a Mario game, piecing together situations from the game in a meaningful way as it would appear in a Mario video game. For the \\"Galactic Suite\\", the game‚Äôs story was already more developed for him to take inspiration from, and so the themes could be transitioned together more effectively to tell a story of Mario‚Äôs galactic journey, jumping back and forth between small planets. Shiro Hamaguchi and Hayato Matsuo were chosen to make arrangements featuring a less experimental approach in order to balance out the concert program. Jonne Valtonen was commissioned to compose the original fanfare and as the sole arranger on Symphonic Poem, a 5 part, 35 minute symphonic movement based on the Zelda series. Even before the set list and titles to be featured in the concert was announced, 60% of the tickets were already sold within the first few weeks of sale. Legend of Zelda - Symphonic Poem The Symphonic Poem of the Legend of Zelda music is told through melody in 5 movements, titled Hyrulian Child, Dark Lord, Princess of Destiny, Battlefield, and Hero of Time. The total running time for the arrangement is 35 minutes, and was presented as the entire second act of the Symphonic Legends and subsequent LEGENDS concerts. The concept was conceived by concert producer Thomas B√∂cker, and arranged by Jonne Valtonen. The Symphonic Poem is one of the longest orchestrated video game piece performed by an orchestra, and contains over 100,000 notes in total. The inspiration for the arrangement was the Symphonic Poem Ein Heldenleben by Richard Strauss and also music composed by Tchaikovsky. The Symphonic Poem of Legend of Zelda tells the story of Link‚Äôs journey from a spirited adolescent to the hero of time, telling the story of romance, darkness, war and hope throughout the poem, maturing the character of Link from a child to becoming a hero. The arrangement features lyrics sung in Latin, written by Thomas B√∂cker and Susanna P√∂lt. Valtonen had previously written the Legend of Zelda arrangement featured in the touring concert act PLAY! A Video Game Symphony, but was eager to create an arrangement that would be able to take advantage of the entire Zelda universe, from character themes, situations and emotional elements often found in the series. It took Valtonen about five months to create the arrangement, with three months used for researching the Zelda universe, and two months for the actual writing. Valtonen also expressed that he wanted the arrangement to create ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù within the Zelda fan base. Show The concert was held on September 23, 2010. The event was preceded by a Meet and Greet session with Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo and Benyamin Nuss in attendance. Torsten Rasch was also on hand to attend the concert. It was held in the Cologne Philharmonic Hall, and was a sold out event for the venue. The concert was performed by WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and State Choir LATVIJA, conducted by Niklas Will√©n. Juraj Cizmarovic was the concertmaster for the event. Will√©n had previously conducted the recording of Valtonen‚Äôs fanfare for Symphonic Fantasies. The games represented were taken from the Japanese video game developer Nintendo. Each piece was constructed as a suite, containing one or more songs arranged together in a sophisticated medley structure. The moderator of the night was Ralph Erdenberger, who would introduce the upcoming musical pieces as well as offer humorous anecdotes. The concert offered a mixture of structures that longtime attendees had grown accustomed to, with the first act being dedicated to a larger number of titles (much like Symphonic Shades) and the second act consisting entirely of a Symphonic Poem, a five-part movement dedicated solely to the Legend of Zelda (similar to the longer suites presented in Symphonic Fantasies). Symphonic Legends opened with an original fanfare composed by Jonne Valtonen for the event. The composition was made to bring to life the lighthearted fun that identifies Nintendo, as well as introduce the orchestra to the audience in an engaging way. The fanfare was titled Fanfare For the Common 8-Bit Hero. The first arrangement of the night was Starwing And Lylat Wars (Space Suite), arranged by famed animation and video game composer Shiro Hamaguchi. Hamaguchi‚Äôs arrangement made extensive use of the State Choir LATVIJA to represent the dramatic space battles found in the video game series. The original music was composed by Hajime Hirasawa and Koji Kondo. The Super Mario Bros (Retro Suite) featured songs from most mainline Mario video games, excluding the Galaxy games, and was arranged by Roger Wanamo. His arrangement made use of light tone, emphasizing the jovial nature of the Mario games. Wanamo also made use of the layering technique that he introduced in his Chrono Trigger\\\\Cross arrangement from the Symphonic Fantasies event. The music featured in this arrangement was composed by Koji Kondo. Shiro Hamaguchi offered his second arrangement of the night with F-Zero (Race Suite). Unlike the games, which feature a very fast-paced hard rock and metal style soundtrack, Hamaguchi‚Äôs arrangements significantly slowed down the source material and emphasized the drama and danger of the fast futuristic race he set out to depict. Prior to the orchestra‚Äôs performance, Rony Barrak performed a Darbuka solo in order to create the atmosphere of tension prior to the race, and joined the orchestra along the main melodic parts. Torsten Rasch offered the most unconventional arrangement to Symphonic Legends, by mixing original composition and abstract dark arrangement in the Super Metroid (Galactic Warrior Suite). This was done in order to tell explore and communicate Samus Aran‚Äôs inner chaos as a space warrior, and only provided a melodic triumph at the very end. The original music was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano. Benyamin Nuss joined on stage to perform piano for the Donkey Kong Country (Aquatic Ambiance) piece, arranged by Masashi Hamauzu. The arrangement was a highly emotional angled interpretation of the source material, featuring delicate interplay between Nuss‚Äôs piano and Cizmarovic‚Äôs violin. The original composition was done by David Wise. Pikmin (Variations on a World Map Theme) was another lighthearted arrangement, portraying the colorful cast of Pikmin as well as bring nature element to the forefront. The piece was arranged by video game composer and orchestrator Hayato Matsuo and composed by Hajime Wakai. The first act was closed out by Wanamo‚Äôs arrangement of the Super Mario Galaxy soundtrack in Mario Galaxy (Galactic Suite). Due to the original game being orchestrated already, the arrangement featured little interpretation, focusing more on the transitioning between the songs and placing between them to accurately portray the game in symphony. The second act was made up entirely by a five-movement Symphonic Poem. The piece was dedicated to the Legend of Zelda series, and was arranged by Jonne Valtonen. The structure of the arrangement was inspired by Ein Heldenleben. Over the course of the 35 minute arrangement, the story of Link is told through 5 submovements. In order to tell a fully developed story, it making use of emotional overtones and melodic narrative, with passages inspired greatly by cinema. There are over 100,000 notes found in Symphonic Poem, and is the longest video game arrangement commissioned for an orchestra concert. Rony Barrak joined the orchestra for this piece at certain points throughout the performance. An encore was performed after the standing ovation given from the crowd, featuring many of the famous ending themes from the games featured. The word \\"Nintendo\\" could be heard sung from the choir during the ending theme of Super Mario Bros, which closed out the concert. Symphonic Legends was broadcast over radio in 5.1 surround sound on the WDR4 station and was also broadcast online via live video streaming.

Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version stated \\"it [Symphonic Legends] combined what I loved about Symphonic Shades with its diversity in style along the prestige and importance that Symphonic Fantasies offered. Most importantly, they dared to be a bit different and gave us exclusive takes on so many familiar songs, takes that will never fade in our memories due to being so different.\\" and added \\"it was a dream come true and a true gift to my life that I could be in attendance, one that I will always cherish and remember.\\" Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online said \\"The concert offers everything from gushing and epic orchestrations, to clever melodic and harmonic treatments, to impressionist and expressionist masterpieces, to even a full-length symphonic poem, highlighting every section of the orchestra and several soloists along the way.\\" Andreas Hackl of VGM Lounge concluded in his review that \\"Symphonic Legends achieved the same quality found in Symphonic Fantasies.\\" Some criticism was given to the controversial Super Metroid arrangement by Torsten Rasch however, feeling that the piece was too far removed from the original source material. Likewise, some felt Symphonic Poem was indeed too long compared to the more traditional arrangements often heard for video game music. Nevertheless, Symphonic Legends won the Best Live Concert award from the OSVOSTOTY 2010 Awards, and the Best Concert award from Level Magazine . ==LEGENDS== On 1 June 2011, a concert based partially on the arrangements of Symphonic Legends was held in Stockholm, titled LEGENDS. The event was produced by Thomas B√∂cker and featured arrangements based on the many titles of Nintendo by Jonne Valtonen, Roger Wanamo and Masashi Hamauzu, who were all in attendance for the event. The concert was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Gustaf Sj√∂kvists Chamber Choir, conducted by Arnie Roth. Numerous changes were made in order to give the Stockholm audience their own experience rather than a reprise. As such, the arrangements by Shiro Hamaguchi, Hayato Matsuo and Torsten Rasch were replaced by all new arrangements by Valtonen, Hamauzu and Wanamo. In addition, an arrangement of Kirby by Hamauzu was also added to the setlist. Symphonic Poem had some details and nuances tweaked, and was used as the entire second act like it had been at Symphonic Legends. Benyamin Nuss was also on hand to play piano during the new F-Zero arrangement for the event as well as the \\"Aquatic Ambiance\\" piece. The Metroid piece was completely rearranged by Jonne Valtonen, and featured spoken narration, retaining still an experimental take on the original material. An extra encore number was added as well, the \\"Fairy Fountain\\" theme from Legend of Zelda. In attendance was also David Wise, composer of Donkey Kong Country, who stated the event was a ‚Äúdream come true‚Äù for him. In addition to the concert, an exhibition of Nintendo products was set up in the lobby area of the Concert House, including classic game packaging and a life size Link statue. The concert garnered positive reviews from the press, with Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version closing his report saying ‚ÄúNintendo is all about bringing friends and family together, and give them experiences they will never forget. LEGENDS did the very same thing.‚Äù ==References *Symphonic Legends *Personal website of Thomas B√∂cker Category:2010 in German music Category:Nintendo music Category:Video game concert tours Category:2010 concert tours ","title":"Symphonic Legends ‚Äì Music from Nintendo"},{"id":"35339503","text":"H√©ctor Gim√©nez may refer to: * H√©ctor Gim√©nez (baseball) (born 1982), Venezuelan professional baseball catcher * H√©ctor Gim√©nez (footballer) (born 1975), Uruguayan-Mexican football striker ","title":"H√©ctor Gim√©nez"},{"id":"35339522","text":"RAF Watchfield is a former Royal Air Force station which was located north east of Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, England. The airfield opened in 1940 using grass runways and operated by the RAF until 1950, after which it was used by the army for parachute training and development of vehicle air drop with planes flying from RAF Abingdon and using the former airfield as a drop zone. In 1961 16 Parachute Heavy Drop company (RAOC) was formed there. This company moved to RAF Hullavington in February 1971 and the site was closed in 1972. ==Based units== The airfield was used by a large number of units like No. 4 Air Observers Navigation School RAF (which came from RAF Ansty) between 20 July 1940 and 30 August 1941 flying the de Havilland Tiger Moth. No. 11 Air Observers Navigation School RAF also joined on 20 July 1940 but left slightly earlier on 19 July 1941 moving to another airfield. A small group of maintenance units used the airfield for temporary use like No. 5 Maintenance Unit RAF and a Sub-site of No. 7 Maintenance Unit RAF between September and November 1940. No. 50 Group Pool RAF were also present during 1940. No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAF from RAF Hamble were present for a short time arriving 20 July 1940. Beam approach RAF Watchfield was used as one of the first airfields which taught Blind/Beam Approach which meant that when no other aircraft were flying the in country due to the weather, aircraft from Watchfield flew constantly teaching pilots how to land in dangerous conditions. The first unit to use the station for this purpose was the Blind Approach School RAF between 28 September 1940 and 1941 which turned into No. 1 Blind Approach School RAF between 1941 and 31 October 1941 which then turned into No. 1 Beam Approach School RAF which operated between 31 October 1941 and 31 December 1946. Smaller beam approach units also used the airfield like Blind Approach Calibration Flight RAF between 12 July and October 1941 before turning into Beam Approach Calibration Flight RAF which operated between October 1941 and 3 July 1942 and then No. 1 Beam Approach School RAF which helped to create a Beam Approach Technical Training School RAF which operated between October 1942 and 4 December 1943 and the Beam Approach Development Unit RAF which operated between 4 October 1942 and 12 April 1943. Other units * Airfield Controller's School RAF between 15 November 1942 and 1 May 1948. * No. 92 (Forward) Staging Post RAF between 25 May and 13 July 1944. * 'Sparrow' Ambulance Flight RAF using the Sparrow variant of the Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow between 2 June and 2 August 1944 from No. 271 Squadron RAF. * A detachment of Avro Ansons as part of No. 46 Group RAF, RAF Transport Command between May 1944 and 18 July 1944. Air traffic control Watchfield was also involved in Air Traffic Control as the School of Air Traffic Control used Watchfield between 1 November 1946 and 10 February 1950 before moving to RAF Shawbury. ==Army use== After closure by the RAF in 1950, the site became renamed Arnhem Camp. It was used for parachute training with jumps from tethered balloons, and it was used for the development of the 'medium stressed platform' (MSP) which was the basis for air dropping a military Land Rover and Trailer, and later other military vehicles. The site was also used for packing items for air despatch and air drop, which were then transported by truck to RAF airfields, such as RAF Abingdon. The units at Watchfield in the 1950s included 47 Company RASC, and an air despatch training unit. In 1960 1 Army Air Support Organisation (1 AASO) was formed with HQ at Watchfield, and 47 Company and 22 Company joined it.Wait for the Waggon, D.J. Sutton, Publ Leo Cooper, 1998, p261 Also at Arnhem Camp in the 1950s was 2nd Air Maintenance Company RAOC which became the 2nd Airborne Company RAOC. On 16 December 1961 16 Parachute Heavy Drop Company of the RAOC was formed, and Watchfield remained their base until 1971. == \\"Watchfield Free Festival\\" == Between 23 and 31 August 1975 the former airfield was the site of the \\"People's Free Festival\\" (also named \\"Watchfield Free Festival\\"), a free rock festival as a successor of the \\"Windsor Free Festivals\\" from the preceding years which ended in riots in 1974. The british authorities offered the organisers the former airfield as a new venue. Top act in 1975 was Hawkwind. == Current use == The airfield is currently used for a wind farm called Westmill Wind Farm which is owned by Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative. ==References * BBC History - Obessions with Aeroplanes, Part 2 Category:Royal Air Force stations in Oxfordshire Category:Military units and formations established in 1940 Category:Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom ","title":"RAF Watchfield"},{"id":"35339533","text":"Nourishing USA is a United States-based non-profit organization.

He was known for the highly precise style and disciplined execution of his war art, portraits and abstractions. As an art educator and administrator at Mount Allison University, Harris made a considerable contribution to the arts in the Atlantic provinces. Harris' earliest influence was his father, Lawren S. Harris of the Group of Seven. He studied from 1931 to 1933 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, under Rodney J. Burn and Robin Guthrie, and at Central Technical School, Toronto, under Robert Ross. For three years, he taught evening classes at Northern Vocational School, Toronto, before spending a year as art master at Trinity College School, Port Hope. With the outbreak of World War II, Harris joined the war effort, first serving as a trooper with The Governor General's Horse Guards, and then as an official war artist with the same unit. In this capacity, he worked for some time alongside Charles Comfort in Italy. Capt. Lawren Phillip Harris, war artist, Ortona, Italy, circa 1939-1945. In 1946, he was appointed Director of the School of Fine and Applied Arts at Mount Allison University, Sackville, New Brunswick, where he was soon joined on the teaching faculty by Alex Colville. Harris remained at Mount Allison until 1975 as a professor and administrator, and taught summer programs at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and Banff School of Fine Arts. In 1954 he was one of eighteen Canadian artists commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway to paint a mural for the interior of one of the new Park cars entering service on the new Canadian transcontinental train. Each of the murals depicted a different national or provincial park; Harris' was Fundy National Park. Lawren P. Harris held many solo exhibitions at Canadian universities and participated in numerous group shows, including a two-man show with Jack Humphrey at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1955. Among his many affiliations, he was a member of the Canadian Group of Painters, Ontario Society of Artists, Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and Maritime Art Association. Harris held honorary doctorates from Dalhousie University (1971) and Mount Allison University (1976). His work is held in numerous public institutions, including the National Gallery of Canada, Confederation Centre Art Gallery, Canadian War Museum, Art Gallery of Ontario and Beaverbrook Art Gallery. == References == Category:1910 births Category:1994 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian painters Category:Canadian male painters Category:Artists from Toronto Category:Mount Allison University faculty Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts ","title":"Lawren P.

She was not involved in her husband's political career, except to support his decision to resign as Labor leader in 1907. She may also have been influential in her husband's later estrangement from the Australian Labor Party.

The observatory was established in 1903 with the construction of the new Natural Science Building, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Following a devastating fire in 1989 a new observatory opened in September 1991 with a apochromatic refractor telescope and German equatorial mount centered under a 6-meter dome. ==History== The Michigan State Normal College received a gift from the citizens of Ypsilanti: a , $600 Alvan Clark refractor. The original observatory was located on old Pierce Hall and was damaged by a tornado and destroyed in 1893. It was then relocated to the roof of the new Natural Science Building in 1903. The building and observatory was later named after William Sherzer, a science professor at the school who conceived the design for the new building after seeing similar facilities on a visit to Germany. In 1928, a refractor telescope manufactured by telescope maker and amateur astronomer John Mellish was installed on a German equatorial mount built by physics professor Edwin Strong. The University Archives still has data produced by students using this telescope and the brass Negus transit telescope which shared the observatory with the Mellish refractor. In the 1970s and 1980s, members of the EMU student astronomy club made numerous updates and restorations to keep the aging observatory running. Almost half of Sherzer Hall was destroyed in a fire in 1989, including the original observatory. The university decided to rebuild. The new observatory opened in September 1991 with a apochromatic refractor telescope and German equatorial mount centered under a 6-meter dome. A classroom/computer lab was finished in 1997, and additional to telescopes, CCD cameras, and other equipment added to the inventory for student use. A secondary observatory with an automated SCT for CCD imaging was added to the rooftop level, becoming operational in 2008. ==Sherzer Hall== Sherzer Hall is an academic building on the Eastern Michigan University campus, located in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

This is one of the earliest and most important light stations of Nova Scotia, one of the first dozen beacons in Nova Scotia to be lit to guide mariners, a classic red-and- white lighthouse still operated by the Canadian Coast Guard. Sunset at Low Point Lighthouse ==The name== This lighthouse and station are located on low lying, flat point of land that thrusts over out into Spanish Bay. The point has been called both Low Point and Flat Point since at least 1882. The Lighthouse and Lightstation have been entered into the official lists of lights under either name, and often both. Locally, both names are still in common use. The name was formerly approved as Flat Point on June 1, 1909. It was changed to Low Point on October 1, 1953. ==The first light== After 1826, the General Mining Association consolidated the various coal mines around Sydney Harbour and greatly increased the shipping of coal to ports on the Atlantic coast.Hornsby, Stephen J., Nineteenth Century Cape Breton, A Historical Geography , McGill/Queen‚Äôs University Press, 1992, pp. 95-110. In support of this effort, a lighthouse was built at Low Point in 1832 to aid vessels entering Sydney harbour. This first lighthouse was built at a cost of ¬£770. The tower was octagonal, wooden, with its sides painted alternately red and white, high, base to vane. During its first winter the lead roof was blown off in a heavy gale and the light was out until the lantern could be replaced with a new iron lantern. It was so exceedingly cold that the lightkeeper, Robert McNab, was forced to put pans of hot coals around the inside of the lantern to keep the light going; it was nearly impossible to keep up a flame from poor-grade oil when the temperature was minus . In 1856, McNab complained that there had been no repairs or improvements of any consequence in the 19 years of the light's operation. In particular, the tiny dwelling required considerable repair, and the light leading shipping into the increasingly busy Sydney Harbour was considered to be inadequate. New lamps were supplied immediately, which did improve the light, but it was another seven years before a new octagonal iron lantern was installed, providing the room necessary for larger oil burners and reflectors. Low Point Lighthouse Plan By 1878, it was once again necessary to increase the size of the lantern; to accommodate it, the tower had to be strengthened structurally. A temporary light was fitted below the lantern deck while new frames and knees were fitted under the gallery deck. The new iron lantern was 12 sided, in diameter, and able to hold the new lighting apparatus of 13 burners, each with its own reflector. A light was first shown from the new lantern on July 13, 1878, and with all the buildings repaired and painted, the station was in first-rate order. By October 12, 1881 Low Point was a signal station at which the International Code of Signals was in use and was one of two stations on Cape Breton Island of the Maritime Telegraph System . The Port War Signal Station was located at the Flat Point Lighthouse during WWI (1917 - 1918) and WWII. In 1922 a third-order Fresnel double bullseye dioptric lens, group flashing white (5 sec.), manufactured in France by Barbier, B√©nard et Turenne was installed. This replaced the 1857 fixed white, fountain lamp. A steam fog-horn was established at this station in 1903, followed by many alterations and additions over the years to the horn and lighting mechanisms as technology advanced. One of the more serious problems that plagued this station, as it did many others, was erosion. Through the years, upwards of half a million dollars was spent on building and maintaining the breastworks and cribbing. ==The lighthouse today== The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia. In 1938, the wooden tower came to the end of its days and the existing tower was built in its place, a sturdy octagonal reinforced-concrete shaft, painted white and punctuated by a few rectangular openings. Tapered at its base, it flares outward at its top to support a railed platform surmounted by a red, dome-topped iron lantern, reusing the lens and lighting apparatus from the old tower, the circular iron lantern housing built by Chance Brothers, England's famous builders of lenses and lanterns. In 1953, a new dwelling was built for an assistant keeper and electric power was brought to the station. By 1954, the station consisted of the lighthouse tower, fog-alarm building, stores building, oil stores, head keeper's dwelling, and the assistant keeper's dwelling. The old house was torn down, the materials used for general improvements around the station. In 1962, with the addition of a diaphone horn and associated machinery, a third lightkeeper was taken on and a third dwelling built to accommodate him and his family. In 1970 an electronic horn was installed, eliminating the need for engines and compressors used with the diaphone horn-and the third keeper. His dwelling, now surplus, was sold and removed from the station in August 1977. Further downgraded to a one-person station in January 1979, the older two- storey dwelling was first converted to a survival station, then sold and removed in 1987. In the meantime, the third-order Fresnel lens was replaced in October 1984 by a DCB-36 optic, a diameter rotating airport beacon. The Fresnel lens is reported to be in storage at the Coast Guard base in Dartmouth. The round, iron, first-order lantern remains atop the lighthouse tower, the last classic lantern of this type still in use on an operational lighthouse in Nova Scotia. The Low Point Lighthouse was destaffed in 1988 but the newest of the lightkeeper's houses remains onsite, one of the few lightstations to retain its keeper's home. The house has been restored and is in the care of a community non-profit group. ==Heritage designation== The light tower, an iconic landmark, is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building because of its historical associations, and its architectural and environmental values. It was designated 19 October 2006, and is listed in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations. The designation is confined to the footprint of the building. ==An uncertain future== Low Point and Low Point Lighthouse, cir. 2016 Erosion Coastal erosion is an ongoing issue at Low Point. Work to prevent shore erosion at the point was underway as far back as 1915, that year at a cost of $3,223.76. By 1917 repairs were already required to the erosion protection, at a further cost of $1,434.06. By 2015 the lighthouse stood only about away from the nearby cliff, partially protected by the remains of a crumbling wooden seawall. Erosion of the bank is visibly threatening the tower's foundation. Unless a new breakwater is installed, it is only a matter of time before this large, historic, octagonal concrete tower will topple into the sea. Low Point Lighthouse, a cultural heritage site in Canada, number 13966 in the Canadian Register of Historic Places. Declared surplus The Low Point Lighthouse was declared surplus by the Canadian Coast Guard in June 2010 (along with almost all lighthouses in Canada). As a result, the lighthouse had until May 29, 2012 to be nominated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act by a group willing to look after it, or the lighthouse would face disposal. While still active, the lighthouse was declared surplus under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act as Canadian Coast Guard officials had determined Low Point Lighthouse could be replaced with a simpler structure whose operation and maintenance would be more cost- effective. The Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society (NSLPS) made a number of lighthouse petitions in advance of the June 2010 deadline to make sure a request was submitted, while hoping some community group would then take on the responsibility. One of these applications was made for Low Point Lighthouse, although a NSLPS spokesman expressed fear that no one would take it on. Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Parks Canada had received requests from community groups for 26 Cape Breton lighthouses by the 2012 deadline but only seven made the June 1, 2013 deadline for the business plans that were the next step in the guidelines outlined in Canada's then new Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. Low Point Lighthouse Society Debbie Lee Pearson, a director of the Low Point Lighthouse Society (formerly the New Victoria Lighthouse Society), submitted a business proposal in May 2013 for the Low Point Lighthouse. In a Cape Breton Post article, dated April 14, 2014, Stephen Bornais, a communications officer with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, said the department has received the business plan for the Low Point lighthouse: > \\"The preliminary assessment has been completed. The department has also > received letters of support from the community. The department will be in > contact with the community group in the near future with the next steps.\\" The Low Point Lighthouse Society was awarded $75,000 in July 2015, after it won an online voting competition set up by the National Trust for Canada and the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society to award $250,000 to the top three vote-getting lighthouses in three categories. The money will be used renovating the lighthouse and the site around it into a tourism destination, as a venue for weddings and other events. Low Point Lighthouse Society spokeswoman Debbie Lee Pearson in an interview stated that she expected the work to begin in the spring of 2016 and end before the summer season. The renos were actually only the first phase of the society's plan for the site. Taking into account Sydney's growing cruise ship industry, in the longer term the society wants also to establish the lighthouse as one of six or so stops on a new Cape Breton tourist trail that will reveal Sydney Harbour's history and heritage. The society is aiming to also add to the site signage, parking and interpretative panels as well as ‚Äî in the longer-term ‚Äî an RV park, campground, gift shop, caf√© and picnic area. > \\"We see the lighthouse as a stop on a new Sydney Harbour tourist trail > stretching from the Whitney Pier Historical Society Museum, past St. > Alphonsus (gothic-style stone) Church in Victoria Mines, past Fort Petrie > and the lighthouse in New Victoria, on to the Colliery Lands Park in New > Waterford. Each stop has something unique to offer\\" The province and Ottawa have co-funded both a $3,450 engineering assessment of the site's existing seawall and a $7,187 protection study of the nearby shoreline. The society estimates that rebuilding the seawall will cost approximately $400,000. The fall of 2017 saw work begin on the lighthouse tower itself, with contractors chipping away loose exterior concrete, grinding away any and all cracks that are visible, and parging over these areas to prevent further damage from winter freeze thaw cycles. Work will continue in the spring after winter snow and ice clears, with a deadline of December 2018 for completion of the exterior refinishing. ==List of lighthouse keepers== *??-1856-??

The nations home to the highest percentages of the illegal immigrant population were Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Mali, Togo, Ivory Coast, Benin, Liberia, Niger, and Cameroon. From a little over 3,000,000 as at 1952/53 Ghana population had steadily grown to nearly 6,000,000 between 1957 and 1960 mainly through immigration at the time of the \\"Ghana Aliens Compliance Order\\" with foreigners alone forming over 20% of Ghana‚Äôs population in the 1960s. By reason of reversal of frontier rules due to changes in government and deportation policies, Ghana in 2013 houses approximately 20 million inhabitants.

Although he was interested in painting at an early age he did not undertake formal training until 20 years of age when he studied with Ernest Lindner at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate. It was from Linder that Pulford developed his love of watercolour. Pulford joined the RCAF in 1940, serving in North Africa, India and Ceylon, before returning to Canada, in 1945. He enrolled at Mount Allison University where he studied fine arts under Stanley Royle and Christian McKiel, followed by Lawren P. Harris and Alex Colville. He graduated with a B.F.A. degree in 1949 and was immediately offered a position on the teaching staff of the Department of Fine Arts. Although Pulford received honours for his works in both oils and watercolours in the 1950s, from 1960 until his retirement he turned exclusively to watercolours. Ted Pulford was one of a trio of teachers with Lawren P. Harris and Alex Colville that defined the Mount Allison Fine Arts department during the post war era, and its outsized impact on Canadian art and the development of Maritime Realism. As the longest serving member of the trio his on the graduates of the program was the most extensive. Christopher Pratt referred to him as the \\"guru of technique\\", he influenced generations of artists including Hugh Mackenzie, D. P. Brown, Mary Pratt, Christopher Pratt, Roger Savage, Nancy Stevens, Tom Forrestall, and Stephen Scott. He maintained a classical approach to studio course teaching contributing to the departments reputation for teaching realism. For the next 30 years under a heavy teaching load he sought to develop as an artist. During his years at Mount Allison he was also actively involved with the RCAF Squadron (1953‚Äì1963), where he organized and conducted winter training programs and served as Commanding Officer (1961‚Äì1963). He retired from teaching in the Spring of 1980. In May 1983 Mount Allison University conferred on him an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree, the first such to be conferred by Mount Allison. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1994 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian painters Category:Canadian male painters Category:Artists from Saskatoon Category:Mount Allison University alumni Category:Mount Allison University faculty ","title":"Ted Pulford"},{"id":"35340218","text":" HMS Papillon was the French Navy's 12-gun brig Papillon, which the British captured in September 1803.

The 12-gun Papillon participated in the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver, an unsuccessful sortie by the French fleet at Brest on 24 December 1794. In September 1803 the rebel slaves under General Jean- Jacques Dessalines were closely pressing the French troops in northwest Saint Domingue. Captain Walker, of , off the Mole St. Nicholas, persuaded the General not to put the garrison of Saint-Marc to death but to march them to the Mole in safety where Vanguard would take possession of the shipping in the bay. Walker succeeded in evacuating the 850 men of the garrison, all very emaciated. He also brought out the brigs Papillon and Trois Amis (a transport), and the schooner Mary Sally, with 40 or 50 barrels of powder. Papillon was pierced for 12 guns but only mounted six. She had a crew of 52 men under the command of Mons. Dubourg. ==British service== The British took Papillon into service under her existing name.Colledge & Warlow (2006), p.298. She was commissioned in 1804 under Lieutenant John Smyth in the Leeward Islands. In 1805 Lieutenant William Woolsey replaced Smyth. Woolsey received a promotion to Commander in March but was not yet able to take it up. On 15 April 1805 Papillon was anchored at Savanna-la-Mar, Jamaica, when the master of a drogger informed Woolsey that there was a Spanish privateer felucca off the west coast of the island. Woolsey realised that the felucca would escape if he approached in Papillon and so decided to use a stratagem. He borrowed a shallop from a merchant ship, disguised her as a drogger, and put on board 25 men under the command of Lieutenant Prieur. The mock drogger encountered the felucca by 8 p.m. the same evening and Prieur permitted the unsuspecting privateer to come alongside. He then had his men fire a volley into the privateer and board her. In the action, the privateer lost seven men killed or drowned, and eight badly wounded, out of a crew of 25; the British had two men slightly wounded. Four of the privateer's crew swam ashore, where the militia seized them. The privateer was Conception, of 25 tons (bm), armed with one 3-pounder gun and small arms. She was three days out of Cuba and had taken no prizes. Woolsey delivered his prisoners and the wounded to Savanna-La-Mar.. Between 1 March and 2 June 1805 Papillon also recaptured the British schooner Desir√©e.. HMS Heureux and are also both recorded as capturing a ship of the same name during the same period. Papillon is listed in the summary seasonal report to the Admiralty as the captor of Desir√©e, while earlier letters credit the larger ships. In all likelihood Papillon was in company with the other ships and took actual possession. ==Fate== Papillon, still under Woolsey's command, was lost in September 1805, with all her crew. She and sailed from Jamaica on 28 July as escorts to a convoy. On 25 September Papillon parted company from the convoy during a gale in the Atlantic. The convoy arrived at Spithead on 14 October but Papillon never arrived.Morning Post, 16 October 1805; Caledonian Mercury, 19 October 1805. ==Film: Master and Commander== Papillons capture of the Spanish privateer by stratagem in April 1805 bears remarkable similarities to an incident in the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. Writer Patrick O'Brian drew on the Napoleonic Wars for his Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series of novels on which the film is based. Papillon is the same class of ship as used in the film, and the event's date in the film corresponds with the capture of the privateer in Jamaica on 15 April 1805. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * * Category:Brigs of the Royal Navy Category:Captured ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1805 Category:1793 ships Category:Brigs of the French Navy Category:Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Missing ships Category:Ships lost with all hands ","title":"HMS Papillon (1803)"},{"id":"35340225","text":"The 2002 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team represented Rutgers University in the 2002 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Photograph by Mathew Brady The 16th New York Volunteer Cavalry was a cavalry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. A detachment of the 16th New York had the distinction of killing Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth and apprehending accomplice David Herold. ==Service== The regiment was organized in Plattsburgh, New York, and mustered into service from June 19 to September 15, 1863. Consisting of eleven companies of cavalry, Companies A, B, C, and D of the 16th New York took part in the Gettysburg Campaign. The regiment was then dispatched to the defense of Washington D.C. and assigned to the Cavalry Brigade of the XXII Corps of the Department of Washington. Until the end of the Civil War, the 16th New York was repeatedly in action in Northern Virginia and fought a number of engagements against Confederate cavalry commanded by John Singleton Mosby. On August 8, 1864, Capt. James H. Fleming of Company M was killed in action near Fairfax, Virginia. Fleming was the only officer of the 16th New York Cavalry to die in the Civil War.Regimental history from The Union Army Before dawn on April 26, 1865, a detachment of the 16th New York Cavalry under the command of Lt.

At Ferry's direction, Wood forged signatures of the 16th New York Cavalry while a clerk sat across from him signing ballots with names from a roster Wood brought from home. Wood reported this and other such operations he discovered to authorities, and less than two weeks before the election on October 27, 1864, Ferry and another political operative named Edward Donahue, Jr. were tried before a military commission. Ferry confessed and offered up names of other conspirators, while Donahue continued to trial and was convicted, partly on Wood's testimony. Both were sentenced to life in prison, with Lincoln's approval. ==Total strength and casualties== The regiment suffered 1 officer and 20 enlisted men who were killed in action or mortally wounded and 119 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 140 fatalities.http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/cavalry/16thCav/16thCavMain.htm New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center ==Commanders== * Colonel Henry M.

After Butt-Head explains to Beavis that Spurlock is famous only because he ate nothing but fast food for a whole month, the two decide to do the same thing in the hopes of getting fame and women. The boys then start their plans by eating obscene amounts of fast food at Burger World for days and then volunteering to work a shift for their manager, who allows them free food in exchange. The boys then quickly grab as much food as they can before leaving. The boys continue to gorge while in school until Mr. Van Driessen tells them that food is banned in class. After Butt-Head quickly sways Van Driessen's opinion by explaining that they are eating for 30 days \\"like that Sherlock dude\\", Van Driessen assumes that the boys are doing this in order to showcase the dangers of teenage obesity, to which he allows them to continue eating in class and even gets two of the boys' classmates to make a video documentary as their semester service project.

It was directed by George Terwilliger and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is an extant film that is preserved at the Library of Congress.Progressive Silent Film List: Bride's Play at silentera.comThe American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921‚Äì30 by The American Film Institute, c.1971The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Bride's Play ==Film name== The title is inspired by an Irish custom (most likely fabricated) of the same name. In this tradition, the male guests line up and the bride asks each of them if they are the one she loves best, with all but the groom saying no. ==Plot== As described in a film magazine, Aileen Barrett (Davies) and Sir Fergus Cassidy (Standing) have been neighbors for years. He loves her but Aileen has become enamored of a poet, Bulmer Meade (Miller). When she learns that the poet regards her as but a passing whim, she realizes it is Sir Cassidy that she cares for and their wedding is arranged. The Bride's Play, which had been a custom in the Barrett family for years, is announced as being revived for the wedding. The former lover learns that several hundred years ago, during the process of the play at the wedding of a member of the family of Sir Cassidy, the bride was carried off by an old lover who arrived on the scene during its enactment. He attempts to do the same thing at Aileen's wedding, but the modern young woman, confronted with the crisis when he maliciously answers her question in the affirmative in the presence of the many wedding guests, strikes him across the face with her wedding slipper. ==Cast== * Marion Davies as Enid of Cashell / Aileen Barrett * John B.

The massive medieval castle sets by Joseph Urban would be a harbinger of even more impressive medieval sets to come. The stunning location shooting was done at Point Lobos on the Monterey Peninsula, a about 150 miles north of San Simeon, where William Randolph Hearst had begun building his castle in 1919. For the New York City premiere, Hearst commissioned a symphonic score by George Spink (who also plays the butler), but this music now seems lost.Lorusso, Edward (2017), The Silent Films of Marion Davies, CreateSpace, pp. 59-60. ==Preservation status== A print is preserved in the Library of Congress collection Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation.The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: Bride's PlayCatalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress, p. 21, c.1978 American Film Institute ==Status== A limited edition DVD was released by Edward Lorusso with a music score by Ben Model in 2016.

Hedges has been one of the better defenders in MLS since 2014, landing on the MLS Best XI in 2015 and 2016, and winning the MLS Defender of the Year award in 2016. He also has five caps for the United States national team. ==Career== College and amateur Hedges attended Carmel High School (Carmel, Indiana), where he was a member of the 2006 Greyhounds soccer team that went undefeated, and won both the IHSAA Boy's Soccer State Championship and the NSCAA National Championship. He played college soccer at Butler University between 2008 and 2010, and at the University of North Carolina in 2011. During his time at Butler, Hedges was named to the NSCAA All-America Second Team as a junior, and he was also named Horizon League Defender of the Year in both his junior and sophomore years. After transferring to North Carolina, he was named ACC Defensive Player of the Year and to the NSCAA All-America First Team. He scored 6 times on the season and helped lead the Tar Heels defense to a 0.69 goals against average en route to the 2011 NCAA National Championship. Hedges spent time with USL Premier Development League club Fort Wayne Fever in 2009, scoring 0 goals in 9 appearances. He also spent time with USL PDL club Reading United in 2010 and 2011, scoring 4 goals in 24 appearances. Professional FC Dallas selected Hedges in the first round (No. 11 overall) of the 2012 MLS SuperDraft. He made his professional debut on April 5, 2012, in a 1‚Äì0 victory against the New England Revolution. Due to injuries and his excellent play for a rookie, he became a regular starter for the club. His first goal in the 2014 season was a header in the 90th minute against Sporting Kansas City off a free kick taken by Michel. The goal tied the game, 1‚Äì1. Hedges captained the team for the first time in 2014, a move that eventually became permanent. Since becoming captain, he has led the club into the MLS playoffs in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Also in 2015, the club was the Western Conference regular season champions and Supporters' Shield runner-up. For the 2015 MLS season, he was named to the Best XI and as a finalist for Defender of the Year. Dallas was even more successful in 2016, winning the Supporters' Shield and the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Hedges was once again named to the Best XI and, this time, was the winner of the Defender of the Year award. In 2020, he became the all- time leader in MLS appearances for FC Dallas, passing Jason Kreis. International Hedges made his United States men's national soccer team debut on February 8, 2015, when he came on as a substitute in the 72nd minute against Panama in a friendly. He was selected to the U.S. squad for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which the U.S. ended up winning. Hedges started and played 90 minutes in victories over Martinique in group stage play and El Salvador in the quarterfinals. == Honors == University of North Carolina  * NCAA National Champions: 2011  FC Dallas  *U.S. Open Cup: 2016 *Supporters' Shield: 2016  International  United States * CONCACAF Gold Cup: 2017  Individual  *Horizon League Defender of the Year: 2009, 2010 *ACC Defender of the Year: 2011 * NCAA 1st Team All America: 2011 *MLS Best XI: 2015, 2016 *MLS Defender of the Year: 2016 *MLS All-Star: 2017, 2018, 2019 ==See also== * List of current Major League Soccer players with national team caps ==ReferencesUniversity of North Carolina bio * Soccerstats bio Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Butler Bulldogs men's soccer players Category:Carmel High School (Indiana) alumni Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's soccer players Category:Reading United A.C. players Category:FC Dallas players Category:Association football defenders Category:Soccer players from New York (state) Category:USL League Two players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:Major League Soccer All-Stars Category:People from Carmel, Indiana Category:FC Dallas draft picks Category:United States men's international soccer players Category:2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup players Category:CONCACAF Gold Cup-winning players Category:All-American men's college soccer players ","title":"Matt Hedges"},{"id":"35340542","text":"Pearl Lust is a 1936 Australian film directed by A.

Its name is taken from Newland Head that feature prominently at the eastern boundary of the park. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. The park features two long beaches, Waitpinga and Parsons, which are used by surfers and fishers, but are not suitable for swimming due to strong rips and hidden gutters. The park also features several walking trails, including part of the Heysen Trail. ==Camping== The Waitpinga campground is the only campground available in the park. It is situated 750 metres inland from Waitpinga Beach, sheltered from the sea breeze by large sand dunes (the Aboriginal meaning of Waitpinga is \\"Windy Place\\"). The campground features reasonably private individual sites surrounded by native vegetation including pink gums and wattle. Facilities include limited tank water, toilets, picnic areas and a communal barbecue area (including gas barbecues). Wood fires are not permitted at any time; gas or fuel stoves may be used. Camping fees apply. A walking trail that traverses the sand dunes, and affords views of the Southern Ocean coastline, connects the campground and the beach. Other walking trails begin at the eastern end of the campground. ==Walking trails== Several walking trails start from the eastern end of the Waitpinga campground. The following information is based on the Parks SA information sign displayed at the trail head: * Ridgeway Hill Loop Hike. Flat trail crossing open mallee then through dense flowering understorey. A variety of birds can be seen in spring. Distance: 6.25 km return. * Coastal Cliffs Loop Hike. Flat trail to the cliffs of Newland Head. Affords views of the Newland Head cliffs, the Southern Ocean and Kangaroo Island. Distance: 7.5 km return. * Campground to Beach Hike. Distance: 750m. * Heysen Trail.

The alpine climate in these regions strongly affect the ecosystem because temperatures fall as elevation increases, causing the ecosystem to stratify. Dense montane forests are common at moderate elevations, due to moderate temperatures and high rainfall. At higher elevations, the climate is harsher, with lower temperatures and higher winds, preventing the growth of trees and causing the plant community to transition to montane grasslands, shrublands or alpine tundra. ==Life zones== mountain birch at around 750 m in Trollheimen, typical of Scandinavian subalpine forests As elevation increases, the climate becomes cooler, due to a decrease in atmospheric pressure and the adiabatic cooling of airmasses. The change in climate by moving up 100 meters on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75¬∞ of latitude) towards the nearest pole. The characteristic flora and fauna in the mountains tend to strongly depend on elevation, because of the change in climate. This dependency causes life zones to form: bands of similar ecosystems at similar altitude. One of the typical life zones on mountains is the montane forest: at moderate elevations, the rainfall and temperate climate encourages dense forests to grow. Holdridge defines the climate of montane forest as having a biotemperature of between , where biotemperature is the mean temperature considering temperatures below to be . Above the elevation of the montane forest, the trees thin out in the subalpine zone, become twisted krummholz, and eventually fail to grow. Therefore, montane forests often contain trees with twisted trunks. This phenomenon is observed due to the increase in the wind strength with the elevation. The elevation where trees fail to grow is called the tree line. The biotemperature of the subalpine zone is between . Above the tree line the ecosystem is called the alpine zone or alpine tundra, dominated by grasses and low-growing shrubs. The biotemperature of the alpine zone is between . Many different plant species live in the alpine environment, including perennial grasses, sedges, forbs, cushion plants, mosses, and lichens. Alpine plants must adapt to the harsh conditions of the alpine environment, which include low temperatures, dryness, ultraviolet radiation, and a short growing season. Alpine plants display adaptations such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and hairy leaves. Because of the common characteristics of these zones, the World Wildlife Fund groups a set of related ecoregions into the \\"montane grassland and shrubland\\" biome. A region in the Hengduan Mountains adjoining Asia‚Äôs Tibetan Plateau have been identified as the world‚Äôs oldest continuous alpine ecosystem with a community of 3000 plant species, some of them continuously co-existing for 30 million years. Climates with biotemperatures below tend to consist purely of rock and ice. ==Montane forest== Waimea Canyon, Hawaii is known for its montane vegetation. Montane forests occur between the submontane zone and the subalpine zone. The elevation at which one habitat changes to another varies across the globe, particularly by latitude. The upper limit of montane forests, the tree line, is often marked by a change to hardier species that occur in less dense stands. For example, in the Sierra Nevada of California, the montane forest has dense stands of lodgepole pine and red fir, while the Sierra Nevada subalpine zone contains sparse stands of whitebark pine. The lower bound of the montane zone may be a \\"lower timberline\\" that separates the montane forest from drier steppe or desert region. Montane forests differ from lowland forests in the same area. The climate of montane forests is colder than lowland climate at the same latitude, so the montane forests often have species typical of higher-latitude lowland forests. Humans can disturb montane forests through forestry and agriculture. On isolated mountains, montane forests surrounded by treeless dry regions are typical \\"sky island\\" ecosystems.  Temperate climate  Pine forest in Abkhazia Montane forests in temperate climate are typically one of temperate coniferous forest or temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, forest types that are well known from Europe and northeastern North America. The trees are, however, often not identical to those found further north: geology and climate causes different related species to occur in montane forests. Montane forests outside Europe tend to be more species-rich, because the major mountain chains of Europe are oriented east-west. Montane forests in temperate climate occur in Europe (the Alps, Carpathians, Caucasus and more), in North America (Cascade Range, Klamath-Siskiyou, Appalachians and more), south-western South America, New Zealand and the Himalayas.  Mediterranean climate  Iranian oak scrub in the Zagros Mountains Montane forests in Mediterranean climate are warm and dry except in winter, when they are relatively wet and mild. These forests are typically mixed conifer and broadleaf forests, with only a few conifer species. Pine and juniper are typical trees found in Mediterranean montane forests. The broadleaf trees show more variety and are often evergreen, e.g. evergreen oak. This type of forest is found in the Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, Mexico and the southwestern US, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Subtropical and tropical climate  Tropical montane forest at around 2,000 m in Malaysia In the tropics, montane forests can consist of broadleaf forest in addition to coniferous forest. One example of a tropical montane forest is a cloud forest, which gains its moisture from clouds and fog. Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of mosses covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as mossy forests. Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained. Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between while the upper limit is usually from . ==Subalpine zone== Subalpine fir in Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, United States The subalpine zone is the biotic zone immediately below the tree line around the world. In tropical regions of Southeast Asia the tree line may be above , p. 178. whereas in Scotland it may be as low as . fig. 1. Species that occur in this zone depend on the location of the zone on the Earth, for example, Pinus mugo (scrub mountain pine) in Europe, snow gum in Australia, or subalpine larch, mountain hemlock and subalpine fir in western North America. Trees in the subalpine zone often become krummholz, that is, crooked wood, stunted and twisted in form. At tree line, tree seedlings may germinate on the lee side of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection. Further growth is more horizontal than vertical, and additional rooting may occur where branches contact the soil. Snow cover may protect krummholz trees during the winter, but branches higher than wind-shelters or snow cover are usually destroyed. Well- established krummholz trees may be several hundred to a thousand years old. Meadows may be found in the subalpine zone. Tuolumne Meadows in the Sierra Nevada of California, is an example of a subalpine meadow. Example subalpine zones around the world include the French Prealps in Europe, the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountain subalpine zones in North America, and subalpine forests in the eastern Himalaya, western Himalaya, and Hengduan mountains of Asia. ==Alpine grasslands and tundra== Alpine flora near Cascade Pass mire in the Swiss Alps Alpine landscape below Malyovitsa Peak, Rila Mountain, Bulgaria Alpine grasslands and tundra lie above the tree line, in a world of intense radiation, wind, cold, snow, and ice. As a consequence, alpine vegetation is close to the ground and consists mainly of perennial grasses, sedges, and forbs. Annual plants are rare in this ecosystem and usually are only a few inches tall, with weak root systems. Other common plant life-forms include prostrate shrubs, graminoids forming tussocks, and cryptogams, such as bryophytes and lichens. Plants have adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Cushion plants, looking like ground-hugging clumps of moss, escape the strong winds blowing a few inches above them. Many flowering plants of the alpine tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or red- colored pigments capable of converting the sun's light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer. Non-flowering lichens cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed algal cells can photosynthesize at any temperature above , and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. The adaptations for survival of drying winds and cold may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects the tundra is very fragile. Repeated footsteps often destroy tundra plants, leaving exposed soil to blow away, and recovery may take hundreds of years. Alpine meadows form where sediments from the weathering of rocks has produced soils well-developed enough to support grasses and sedges. Alpine grasslands are common enough around the world to be categorized as a biome by the World Wildlife Fund. The biome, called \\"Montane grasslands and shrublands\\", often evolved as virtual islands, separated from other montane regions by warmer, lower elevation regions, and are frequently home to many distinctive and endemic plants which evolved in response to the cool, wet climate and abundant sunlight. The most extensive montane grasslands and shrublands occur in the Neotropical p√°ramo of the Andes Mountains. This biome also occurs in the mountains of east and central Africa, Mount Kinabalu of Borneo, highest elevations of the Western Ghats in South India and the Central Highlands of New Guinea. A unique feature of many wet tropical montane regions is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families, such as Lobelia (Afrotropic), Puya (Neotropic), Cyathea (New Guinea), and Argyroxiphium (Hawaii). Where conditions are drier, one finds montane grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, like the Ethiopian Highlands, and montane steppes, like the steppes of the Tibetan Plateau. ==See also== * * * Forest ecology * Tree line * Temperate coniferous forests * Ecology of the Rocky Mountains * Sierra Nevada lower montane forest * East African montane forests * Afromontane, a series of high-elevation regions in Africa * California montane chaparral and woodlands, an ecoregion. * Angolan montane forest-grassland mosaic, an ecoregion. * Australian Alps montane grasslands, an ecoregion. * South Western Ghats montane rain forests, an ecoregion * Polonyna (montane meadow) * Altitudinal zonation * Biome ==References *Tree cover map for mountain forests - UNEP Map 2011 Category:Forest ecology Category:Subfields of ecology ","title":"Montane ecosystems"},{"id":"35340578","text":"Nine Lashes is an American Christian rock band from Birmingham, Alabama formed in 2006. They independently released their first album, Escape, in 2009 before Trevor McNevan of Thousand Foot Krutch brought them to the attention of Tooth & Nail Records. Upon signing to the label, the band recorded their second album World We View and released it on February 14, 2012. The album sold well, making several Billboard charts. The band released their third album, From Water to War on January 21, 2014. After a change in direction, the band released their fourth album, the electronica and Christian rock styled Ascend on March 11, 2016. ==History== The band was formed in 2006 around founding members guitarist Adam \\"Tank\\" Jefferson and original drummer Keith Cunningham, who had played together in another band for several years prior. Jared \\"Gus\\" Lankford and Adam's brother Jon Jefferson joined as bassist and guitarist, and lead singer Jeremy Dunn joined in 2007 after the band's original vocalist got married and decided to settle down. During this early period, the band opened for Day of Fire at Life Church in Trussville, Alabama, was interviewed on WDJC-FM, and worked extensively with the organization Teen Challenge. On June 5, 2009, the band independently released their debut album Escape with producer Travis Wyrick on Collide Records. In the first of a series of events Dunn later described as \\"completely a God thing\\", the band was hoping to increase their visibility via a performance at Gardendale, Alabama's annual Magnolia Festival. To this end, Jon sent a copy of Escape to Joe Posey, the festival's promoter. Posey liked the album and decided to attend one of the band's concerts to see if they could play live. Even more impressed by the band's live performance, he forwarded his copy of Escape along with a recommendation to his longtime friend Trevor McNevan, himself a well-known musician and producer. Recovering at home from a ruptured appendix, McNevan was able to hear the album despite his busy schedule, shared Posey's enthusiasm, and passed the album on to Brandon Ebel, president and CEO of Tooth & Nail Records (to which McNevan's own bands Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static were signed). This resulted in Nine Lashes signing with the label, which was officially announced on June 27, 2011. Later in 2011, Nine Lashes was selected to join I Am Empire and Blood and Water on the former's Kings and Queens Tour, replacing original co-headliners Queens Club, who had ended up disbanding before the tour started. They also joined the American leg of Red's REDvolution tour in February and March 2012, and are scheduled to play at the annual Creation Northwest and Kingdom Bound festivals in the summer. The band's second album, World We View, was released on February 14, 2012. The album was co-produced by McNevan and Aaron Sprinkle and featured guest vocals from McNevan and Demon Hunter frontman Ryan Clark. In the week of March 3, 2012, the album debuted on Billboard and peaked at No. 17 on the Christian Albums chart, No. 5 on Top Heatseekers, No. 13 on Top Hard Rock Albums, and No. 43 on Top Rock Albums. The band announced their \\"From Water\\" tour on August 9, 2013, to support their new album, From Water to War, which was released on January 21, 2014. On October 29, they released a new single titled \\"Break the World\\" and soon after released \\"Surrender\\" - both early releases from their new album. In an interview with CCM Magazine, Dunn stated: \\"We really pushed ourselves to add to our sound with this album. We really wanted to take the digital aspect of our sound from the last album, like the 'Anthem [of the Lonely]' intro or 'The Intervention,' and expand upon it. I think we ended up with a really well-rounded album.\\" The band's fourth album, Ascend, was released on March 11, 2016. The album largely abandons the group's hard rock sound in favor of EDM and dubstep-inspired music. However, five singles released between 2018 and 2020 show a return to hard rock. == Members == Current * Jeremy Dunn ‚Äî lead vocals * Jonathan David Jefferson ‚Äî guitar, bass * Andrew Joseph Jefferson ‚Äî guitar, bass * Noah Terrell ‚Äî drums * Adam \\"Tank\\" Jefferson ‚Äî guitar * Jared Lankford ‚Äî bass Past * Keith Cunningham ‚Äî drums == Discography == Albums {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Released !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Title !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Label !! colspan=\\"6\\"Peak Chart Positions - !US 200 !US Christ. !US Heat. !US Indie !US Hard Rock !US Rock -  June 5, 2009  Escape  Collide Records  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äì  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ‚Äì  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ‚Äî -  February 14, 2012  World We View  Tooth & Nail Records  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äì  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 17  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 5  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äì  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 13  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 43 -  January 21, 2014  From Water to War  Tooth & Nail Records  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 121  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 8  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äì  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 29  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 8  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 43 -  March 11, 2016  Ascend  BEC Recordings  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"46  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ‚Äî  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî } Singles {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Released !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Title !! colspan=\\"2\\"Chart peak!! rowspan=\\"2\\"Album - !Christian Airplay !Christian Rock -  rowspan=\\"2\\"2009  \\"Words of Red\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"15 rowspan=\\"2\\"Escape -  \\"Word of Advice\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"25 -  2011 \\"Anthem of the Lonely\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1 rowspan=\\"3\\"World We View -  rowspan=\\"2\\"2012  \\"Get Back\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3 -  \\"Write It Down\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"6 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2013 \\"Break the World\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1 rowspan=\\"5\\" From Water to War -  \\"Surrender\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"47 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1 -  2014  \\"Never Back Down\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2015 \\"You Are the Light\\"style=\\"text- align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1 -  \\"Cover Your Own\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  8 -  \\"Galaxy\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1 rowspan=\\"4\\"Ascend -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2016  \\"Ascend\\"style=\\"text- align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  28 -  \\"The Chosen Ones\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"-- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  12 -  \\"Deeper\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  22  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  43 -  2018 \\"Breaking Out\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -- style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 27  rowspan=\\"5\\" non-album single -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 2020 \\"Guilty Hands\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -- style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 31 -  \\"Shadows\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî -  \\"Dear Self\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî -  \\"Rise\\"style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  -- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ‚Äî } Music videos { class= - !Year !Title - rowspan=\\"2\\"2012 \\"Anthem of the Lonely\\" - \\"Get Back\\" - 2014 \\"Surrender\\" } == References  External links == * * Nine Lashes at Tooth and Nail's official website * Nine Lashes at Jesus Freak Hideout Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Alabama Category:Tooth & Nail Records artists Category:Christian alternative metal groups Category:American post-grunge musical groups Category:American alternative metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Birmingham, Alabama ","title":"Nine Lashes"},{"id":"35340581","text":"Group D of the 1996 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I was one of four pools in the Europe/Africa Zone Group I of the 1996 Fed Cup.

It is estimated to have 780 beds, although the true number of patients always exceeds the number of beds. It serves approximately 5 million people, referred from five district hospitals and from other parts of Malawi and parts of neighboring Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. ==Location== The hospital is located in an area of the city of Lilongwe called Area 33 (also Nangwagwa), south of the Lingazi Namilomba Forest Reserve and the Lilongwe Wildlife Centre; adjacent to Kamuzu College of Nursing. The geographical coordinates of the hospital are:13¬∞58'37.0\\"S, 33¬∞47'11.0\\"E (Latitude:-13.976944; Longitude:33.786389). ==Overview== Kamuzu Central Hospital is a large referral hospital that serves as the referral hospital for the Central Region of Malawi. It is the referral hospital for about 5 million people. As of May 2020, it had about 60 doctors and about 300 nurses. As of 2019, the hospital admitted as many as 25,000 children annually. That is an average of about 70 children daily. In April 2012, the late Bingu wa Mutharika (24 February 1934‚Äì5 April 2012), the third President of Malawi was admitted to Kamuzu Central Hospital and was diagnosed with cardiac arrest. ==History== The hospital was built in 1977 by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), with money provided by the government of Denmark. Political problems cropped up before the hospital was complete. Only the first phase was finished. The departments that were left out included (a) Obstetrics & Gynecology including Antenatal care (b) Orthopedics (c) Psychiatry and (d) Tuberculosis unit. From 1977 until 2004, the hospital was known as Lilongwe Central Hospital. In 2004, it rebranded to its current name. ==Collaboration and partnerships== Kamuzu Central Hospital has a partnership with the University of North Carolina. The objective of the collaboration is to \\"identify innovative, culturally acceptable, and affordable methods to improve the health of the people of Malawi, through research, capacity building, and care\\". The hospital also receives support from Baylor Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI). Additional support came from the German Hospital Partnership MAGNET, administered through the German Corporation for International Cooperation GmbH (GIZ).

It is published by Kadokawa Games in Japan, Marvelous USA in North America, and Deep Silver in Europe. ==Gameplay== A \\"Scarlet\\" side mission in Killer Is Dead; Mondo fights off a group of enemies within a time limit. Killer Is Dead is an action video game where players take control of protagonist Mondo Zappa. As Zappa, the player goes through twelve story-driven missions selected from a world map; they range from short linear levels to longer levels that require exploration. Some level areas also require the activation of switches to move forward. During missions, Mondo fights a variety of enemies using his katana and cybernetic gun arm; using the latter changes the camera angle to an over- the-shoulder perspective. The combat of Killer Is Dead relies on maintaining the combo meter. Each time Mondo hits an enemy, he starts a combo chain which grows as long as Mondo lands consecutive hits without an enemy hitting him. At the highest combo level, special attacks are unlocked which provide different upgrade materials. Some enemies can only be finished off with a cinematic final attack, triggered once Mondo has absorbed enough blood from his enemies by chaining together combos. Mondo can both block and dodge attacks. Dodging plays to combat, as dodging at the right moment causes Mondo to enter Adrenaline Rush, where enemies are slowed and Mondo can land rapid attacks. Mondo's gun arm can transform into three gun types; the rapid fire \\"Bullet Shot\\" type, the \\"Freeze Shooter\\" which fires ice bullets to slow and even stop enemies, and the power \\"Charge Cannon\\" which deals higher damage when shots are charged up. The game features three mission types: story-based missions that move the narrative forward; sub-missions set within the main levels where Mondo must complete tasks that can vary from pure combat missions to retrieval quests; and \\"Scarlet\\" missions where the female support character Scarlet issues combat challenges. After completing each mission, the player is awarded with a rank and a consequent level of upgrade items and in-game currency. These can be used for a fourth mission type dubbed \\"Gigolo Missions\\". During Gigolo Missions, Mondo goes out with a selection of women and fill up a \\"Guts\\" meter by making eye contact, with more intimate areas such as their breasts granting more points. The woman's attachment to Mondo is increased by buying and presenting gifts during the mission; gifts for the women range from flowers and chocolates to types of lingerie. If the women sees you looking at those areas, a second meter decreases and if it empties Mondo fails the mission. Successfully completing Gigolo Missions grants Mondo access to weapon upgrades. ==Synopsis== Setting and characters Killer Is Dead is set on a near future version of Earth, where space tourism and cybernetic enhancements have become a reality. A key element of the story is Dark Matter, a malign energy stemming from the dark side of the Moon that negatively affects weak- willed humans and generates mindless monsters called Wires. It is the job of a government-funded group dubbed the Bryan Execution Firm to kill those infected with Dark Matter using people known as \\"Executioners\\", although doing so will inevitably lead the chosen Executioner to be overwhelmed by Dark Matter. The main protagonist is Mondo Zappa, a new Executioner with a business-like attitude towards his work and a liking for beautiful women. His superiors at the Bryan Execution Firm are its cyborg founder Bryan Roses and his second-in- command Vivienne Squall. Mondo is assisted and lives with Mika Takekawa, an air-headed young girl. Two key characters are David, the main antagonist who usurps control of the Moon and directs the Dark Matter; Dolly the Dream Witch, a woman who can enter a person's dreams and alter their memories; and Moon River, the previous ruler of the Moon and one of an ancient line that acted as magistrates and overseers of the Earth. Many characters are thematically connected to celestial bodies; Mondo represents the Earth, David symbolises Mars, Mika the Sun, Moon River the Moon. Plot The game opens with an unhinged former assassin-turned-kidnapper Tokio being killed by his replacement, his darkness ascending to the moon. Two years later, Mondo witnesses the death of his predecessor at Bryan's hands. Mondo is then sent on missions against people who have been tainted by Malice, which causes them to become warped into monsters and perform evil deeds. One of his earliest missions is given by Moon River, ruler of the Moon, to kill David after he usurps her. Mondo and David fight, but Mondo is unable to kill him and David cryptically hints that he needs to grow stronger by absorbing the blood of those corrupted by Dark Matter. Moon River decides to wait until the contract can be completed, and Mondo allows her to live with him until then. Mondo goes on further missions against people infected with Dark Matter. Following each execution, a piece of the targets' Dark Matter and their blood is absorbed by Mondo's arm, causing him great pain. He is also tormented in his dreams by Dolly, seeing flashbacks of Moon River playing with him as a child with a strange blue unicorn; and David attacking his home, killing his mother and cutting off Mondo's arm before being left at the Bryan Execution Firm by the unicorn. During one mission, Vivienne considers killing Mondo as the Dark Matter begins overtaking him. On another mission, Bryan is nearly killed by Mika, who is likewise being influenced by Dolly. During his final confrontation with Dolly to free both himself and Mika from her influence, Mondo remembers the truth; he and David are brothers, David was one of Bryan's former Executioners before being tainted with Dark Matter. Mondo was then groomed by Bryan to take down David. David in turn planted Mika‚Äîthe girl kidnapped by Tokio and rescued by David‚Äîas a spy to find out who would be David's assigned killer, and plans to make Mondo the Moon's new ruler while he conquers Earth. In a final confrontation on the Moon, Mondo and David face off, with Mondo using the power of Dark Matter to win the fight. Absorbing David's blood pushes Mondo over the edge, and he cuts off his cyborg arm in an attempt to stem the flow of Dark Matter. The game ends with Mondo taking David's place as ruler of the Moon and its Dark Matter, and Moon River issuing a new contract for Mondo's life. ==Development== Planning for Killer Is Dead began in late 2009 and proper development started in early 2011. Suda was inspired to title the project Killer Is Dead after The Smiths's song \\"The Queen is Dead\\". Initially the title was only a placeholder, however over time Suda began to feel that the name matched up with the style he was going for. The game was announced in April 2012, the debut trailer premiered in January 2013. Suda describes it as a \\"Dark Side 007\\" game, drawing inspiration from Ian Fleming's James Bond books and films. Unlike Bond, however, the main character of Killer Is Dead deals with a seedier underworld that the surface world does not register. The game is not a sequel to Killer7 but it maintains the essence of his past \\"assassin series\\" games and \\"picks up where Killer7 and No More Heroes left off\\". Suda also calls the game \\"yin\\" to bright and cheery Lollipop Chainsaws \\"yang\\". Gameplay feature swords like in No More Heroes but with expanded systems, guns, and wrestling action. The visual style is an enhancement and evolution of the cel-shaded style of No More Heroes. The team had originally experimented with a realistic graphical style and a cartoon style reminiscent of Killer7 before settling on the final design. ==Release== The game was released in summer 2013, published by Kadokawa Games in Japan and Marvelous USA in North America. Deep Silver, the European publisher, and Sony Computer Entertainment Asia, the publisher for the Asian release outside Japan, announced that these editions of the game would include both English and original Japanese voice acting tracks. A PC version was announced on February 17, 2014 as Killer Is Dead: Nightmare Edition. It was released on May 23, 2014 on a disc and as a digital download. It includes a new difficulty mode called Nightmare. In it enemies can only be defeated using three attacks: Adrenaline Burst, Dodge Burst and Headshots. ==Reception== During its first week, the PS3 version of Killer Is Dead debuted in fifth place, selling just over 17,700 units. By the end of 2013, the PS3 version had sold a little over 23,000 units. In the United Kingdom, the game did poorly during its debut month, reaching twenty-sixth place behind many other new titles including Lost Planet 3 and Rayman Legends. The PS3 and 360 versions of the game both scored 64 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, based on 39 and 38 critic reviews respectively. Japanese magazine Famitsu gave the game a Platinum award as part of its review; its world design and gameplay were both praised, but the magazine criticised control issues similar to those seen in earlier Grasshopper Manufacture games. Western critics were generally mixed about the game. The story was cited as either poorly written or confusing, while the gameplay was praised for its emphasis on dodging despite a lack of evolution for secondary mechanics. The art design was also praised, but reaction to the music was mixed and voice acting was described as poor. The Gigolo missions were panned by Western critics due to their negative portrayal of women and the actions the player was forced to take to complete them. Control issues were also called out by several critics, in addition to other technical issues. The PC-exclusive Nightmare Edition scored 71 points out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 8 critic reviews. Adam Beck of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a score of 4/5 and was generally positive; he compared the story's tone favorably to Only God Forgives and praised both the level design and gameplay, but found its PC version underwhelming due to a lack of graphical options and poor control optimization. In contrast, PC Gamers Andy Kelly gave a score of 45 out of 100 points, calling it both a weak game compared to Suda's previous work and a poor port of the console version due to similar issues to those raised by Beck, referring to it as the \\"very definition of style over substance\\". ==NotesReferences * Category:2013 video games Category:Action video games Category:Grasshopper Manufacture games Category:Deep Silver games Category:Hack and slash games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Single- player video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games about amnesia Category:Video games about dreams Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Akira Yamaoka Category:Video games set on the Moon Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Killer Is Dead"},{"id":"35340669","text":"The Cueva de Don Justo (or Cave of Don Justo) is one of approximately 70 caves and volcanic galleries on the island of El Hierro in the Canaries.

Jeffrey tries to convince Elsa to avoid spending while he makes investments in an effort to provide them with enough wealth to live comfortably for the rest of their lives, but she had impulsively placed a large bet and immediately is $10,000 in debt. Later, after helping raise money for a charitable cause, she steals this money and invests it in a stock scheme, and promptly loses it as well when the stock tanks. Hardy Livingston (Irving Pichel), a wealthy lady's man, has his eye on Elsa and finds his chance to trap her into an adulterous affair by giving her the money she needs to repay the charity money. The next day Jeffrey informs her his investments have paid off and they are now fabulously wealthy. She attempts to repay the money she had borrowed from Livingston, however he wants sexual favors instead. Elsa says she would rather commit suicide; Livingston hands her a pistol and invites her to do so and when she does not, he attempts to rape her and she responds by taking the pistol and shooting him. A suspicious Jeffrey has followed her and takes the blame for the shooting. As Jeffrey is on trial, Livingstone claims Jeffrey had tried to cheat him out of a debt and then shot him. To protect Elsa, Jeffrey refuses to deny this, and so Elsa stops the trial by shouting out the truth and showing the court the brand Livingstone had placed on her. The judge drops the charges against Jeffrey, Elsa promises again to stop gambling and the film ends. ==Cast== * Tallulah Bankhead as Elsa Carlyle * Harvey Stephens as Jeffrey Carlyle * Irving Pichel as Hardy Livingstone * Jay Fassett as Terrell * Ann Andrews as Mrs. Albright * William Ingersoll as Croupier * Hanaki Yoshiwara as Japanese Servant * Willard Dashiell as Judge * Edward Keane as Defense Attorney * Robert Strange as District Attorney * Ruth Donnelly as Woman in Court Behind Elsa (uncredited) * Jimmy Granato as Orchestra Musician (uncredited) * Porter Hall as Leslie (uncredited) * Arthur Hohl as Defense Attorney (uncredited) * Millard Mitchell as Courtroom Spectator (uncredited) * Henry Warwick as Butler (uncredited) ==References*Stills at pre-code.com Category:1931 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:American film remakes Category:Sound film remakes of silent films Category:American drama films Category:1931 drama films ","title":"The Cheat (1931 film)"},{"id":"35340719","text":"Tsemdolina () is a locality on the territory of the City of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai, Russia.

The majority of the album was self-produced, written and recorded by the band. Lyrically, the album focuses on the band struggling with and overcoming adversity, namely, being dropped from their major record label contract after their prior album, Against the Grain. One single from the album, \\"Bitter End\\", was released in March 2012. ==Background and recording== After the band released their second album, Against the Grain, in 2009, and toured in support of it throughout 2010, they were dropped from their record label Universal Motown Records. While the band had written much of the album shortly after being let go from the label, progress was held up for eight months due to legal issues arising from leaving the label.http://www.mycitybuzz.com/archives/1857 Additionally, while it was not announced until February 2012, much earlier second guitarist James Fiddler and bassist Marc Roots decided they would be leaving the band. Band founder and guitarist Eric Schraeder said of the situation: > At the end of the day, this is how the whole band started, with Crispin and > I‚Äôs vision. It was weird and kind of surreal to find that six years later > through a record deal, through all the stuff we had been through, we were > kind of back at square one again. It was kind of crazy sitting there back in > Vancouver, literally without a band...There was a lot of down time within > leaving the record label and finding a new home, and recording the new > record, And in that time you know, people grow apart. people have different > views and different thoughts on the way their lives should be lived \\" Despite this, Schraeder and the other co-founder, vocalist Crispin Earl, decided to continue on with the album, announcing their intention that they would be working on releasing the album in 2011, even without major record label support. Fiddler and Roots would still contribute and play on the album, but would not tour in support of the album after release. The two left amicably, with Schraeder stating they're still in weekly contact. Roots was replaced by the band's bass tech, Winston Wolfe. Fiddler was not replaced at all, with the band opting to continue on as a quartet. The album was primarily self-produced, although they did receive some help from Brian Howes on the track \\"Bitter End\\" and from sound engineer Jason Vanpeoderooyen. Earl stated that working as an independent band had its negatives and positives. Earl and Schraeder had to put down roughly $100,000 of their own money to finance the album.http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/2571/The-Veer- Union:-There-Goes-$100000-But-At-Least-Everybody-Will-Get-To-See-The-Car. However, at the same time, they both enjoyed the creative freedom of making the album they truly wanted, not having to submit to demands of a record label. The album was recorded in eight different studios in two countries. They initially aimed for a November 2011 release, but the date was later pushed back into March 2012. ==Writing and composition== Lyrically, the album is centered around the hopelessness and desperation Earl and Schraeder felt after starting fresh without record label support or past bandmates.http://www.lithiummagazine.com/interview-crispin-earl-veer-union- april-10-2012 Earl also identified his frustrations with the poor current state of rock music popularity in general as another contributor to the lyrics. Earl referred to the album as \\"conceptual sounding album\\" of \\"hard times\\", and would elsewhere say of the album: > I would say that this record is about the all the twists and turns that life > has taken us on emotionally over the last few years going through label > changes and member changes. Sonically and lyrically this record is just a > little more pissed off and raw to the core. I think what drives me to write > is every experience that I have lived through whether its good or bad. > Through every turn Eric and I experienced through the process of writing > this record it seemed like forces of nature were against us causing the > record to possibly never see the light of day, but every time that happened > we would just write about that moment and keep going. Hence the title of the > record Divide The Blackened Sky.\\" The track \\"I Will Remain\\" took the band multiple years to write. Earl and Schraeder aimed to make the album sound much more heavy, dark, and gritty than their prior album, Against the Grain. They emphasized moving in a more \\"rock' direction, staying away from any ballads. ==Release and promotion== In 2011, they held a contest to have fans submit artwork to be picked to be on the album's front cover. A week prior to the album release, the band released the album to be streamed in its entirety online, and released a special iPhone App that provided news and media to the public. The album was finally released on March 26, 2012,. and charted at no. 33 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums chart. The band went on a 3-month North American tour that spanned April through June 2012, touring with Korn, Staind, Buckcherry, and My Darkest Days. A deluxe edition of the album, with three additional tracks, was released in June 2014. ==Reception== The album received generally positive reviews.

In 1864, he apprenticed with his father and worked on the organs of the Reformed Churches in Mulhouse, France and Glarus, Switzerland, as well as the German Reformed Church in Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 1886, Walcker and his four brothers Eberhard Heinrich (1828-1903), Friedrich (1829-1895), Karl (1845-1908) and Eberhard (1850-1928) founded the Ludwigsburg Organ Company. An argument in 1892 with the Wilhelm Sauer Organ Company required the mediation of Alexander Wilhelm Gottschalg. In the spring of 1894, Walcker became the managing director and official representative of William Sauer, and in 1910, Sauer retired, selling the company to Walcker, who ran the company until 1917 when he sold the Walcker Sauer Company to his nephew, Oscar Walcker (1869 -1948), head of the Walcker organ company in Ludwigsburg. Walcker was award the Order of the Crown for the organ in the Berlin Cathedral and the Order of the Red Eagle IV Class for the organ at Wroc≈Çaw's Centennial Hall.

He was most active in film beginning in the 1930s and through the mid-1940s. Beginning in the mid-1950s, he transitioned to television and enjoyed success there through the 1960s. Stephens was also an avid competitive glider pilot. He was inducted into the Soaring Hall of Fame in 1966 for his contributions to the sport. == Early years == Stephens was born in Los Angeles. As a student at the University of California at Los Angeles, he earned letters in basketball and football. Before he turned to acting, Stephens worked in western copper mines and Mexican oil fields in addition to working around the world on a freighter. == Stage == Stephens' debut in the theater came in 1920 at the Pilgrimage Play in Hemet, California. Following that, he toured for two years in a troupe headed by Walter Hampden and worked in stock theater companies in several cities. On Broadway, At the Times Square Theatre, Stephens appeared as Sam Worthing in Other Men's Wives, written by Walter C. Hackett, late in 1929.

It produces a ‚Äúglobal snapshot‚Äù of all the ribosomes active in a cell at a particular moment, known as a translatome. Consequently, this enables researchers to identify the location of translation start sites, the complement of translated ORFs in a cell or tissue, the distribution of ribosomes on a messenger RNA, and the speed of translating ribosomes. Ribosome profiling involves similar sequencing library preparation and data analysis to RNA-Seq, but unlike RNA-Seq, which sequences all of the mRNA of a given sequence present in a sample, ribosome profiling targets only mRNA sequences protected by the ribosome during the process of decoding by translation. This technique is different from polysome profiling. ==History== Ribosome profiling is based on the discovery that the mRNA within a ribosome can be isolated through the use of nucleases that degrade unprotected mRNA regions. This technique analyzes the regions of mRNAs being converted to protein, as well as the levels of translation of each region to provide insight into global gene expression. Prior to its development, efforts to measure translation in vivo included microarray analysis on the RNA isolated from polysomes, as well as translational profiling through the affinity purification of epitope tagged ribosomes. These are useful and complementary methods, but neither allows the sensitivity and positional information provided by ribosome profiling. == Uses == There are three main uses of ribosome profiling: identifying translated mRNA regions, observing how nascent peptides are folded, and measuring the amount of specific proteins that are synthesized.  Identifying Translated mRNA Regions  By using specific drugs, ribosome profiling can identify either initiating regions of mRNA or elongating regions. Initiating regions can be detected by adding harringtonine or lactidomycin to prevent any further initiation. This allows the starting codon of the mRNAs throughout the cell lysate to be analyzed, which has been used to determine non-AUG sequences that do initiate translation. The other elongating regions can be detected by adding antibiotics like cycloheximide that inhibit translocation, chloramphenicol that inhibits transfer of peptides within the ribosome, or non-drug means like thermal freezing. These elongation freezing methods allow for the kinetics of translation to be analyzed. Since multiple ribosomes can translate a single mRNA molecule to speed up the translation process, RiboSeq demonstrates the protein coding regions within the mRNA and how quickly this is done depending on the mRNA being sequenced. This also allows for ribosome profiling to show pause sites within the transcriptome at specific codons. These sites of slow or paused translation are demonstrated by an increase in ribosome density and these pauses can link specific proteins with their roles within the cell.  Peptide Folding  Coupling ribosome profiling with ChIP can elucidate how and when newly synthesized proteins are folded. Using the footprints provided by Ribo-Seq, specific ribosomes associated with factors, like chaperones, can be purified. Pausing the ribosome at specific time points, allowing it to translate a polypeptide over time, and exposing the different points to a chaperone and precipitating out using ChIP purifies these samples and can show at which point in time the peptide is being folded.  Measuring Protein Synthesis  Ribo-Seq can also be used to measure protein synthesis and its regulators. This can be done by initially disrupting proteins that bind to RNA and using ribosome profiling to measure the difference in translation. These disrupted mRNAs can be associated with proteins, whose binding sites have already been mapped on RNA, to indicate regulation. ==Procedure== # Lyse the cells or tissue and isolate the mRNA molecules bound to ribosomes. # Immobilize complexes. This is commonly performed with cycloheximide but other chemicals can be employed. It is also possible to forgo translation inhibitors with translation-incompetent lysis conditions. # Using ribonucleases, digest the RNA not protected by ribosomes. # Isolate the mRNA-ribosome complexes using sucrose gradient density centrifugation or specialized chromatography columns. # Phenol/chloroform purification of mixture to remove proteins. # Size-select for previously- protected mRNA fragments. # Ligate 3' adapter to fragments. # Subtract known rRNA contaminants (optional). # Reverse transcribe RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. # Amplify in strand-specific manner. # Sequence reads. # Align sequence results to genomic sequence to determine translational profile. ==Materials== * RNA-ribosome complexes * Cycloheximide * Nucleases * Phenol/Chloroform * Reverse transcriptase * dNTPs * Sequencing method-cDNA library. == References  External links == *GWIPS-viz browser *RiboGalaxy *RPF-DB *Trips-VIZ browser Category:Genomics techniques Category:Ribozymes Category:Molecular biology techniques ","title":"Ribosome profiling"},{"id":"35341808","text":"Map of Burma, 1941 The Burma Office was a British government department created in 1937 to oversee the administration of Burma.

It was the first U.S. minor league baseball team composed almost entirely of Cubans.Figueredo 2003, p. 107. Several players, including Dolf Luque and Mike Gonz√°lez, went on to play in the major leagues. The Cubans played in Long Branch, New Jersey from 1913 to 1915, except for the first half of the 1914 season, when they played in Newark, New Jersey. In 1916, they started the season playing in Jersey City, New Jersey as the \\"Jersey City Cubans.\\" Later that summer, they moved their home games to Poughkeepsie, New York, where they were usually referred to as the \\"Long Branch Cubans.\\" In late July 1916 they briefly moved to Harlem and finally to Madison, New Jersey in August. From 1913 to 1914, the Cubans played minor league baseball in the Class D New York‚ÄìNew Jersey League, which in 1914 was renamed as the Atlantic League. In accordance with organized baseball's practice of racial segregation, all of the team's players were white.Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a 1999, pp. 140‚Äì141. The league folded at the end of the 1914 season, and from 1915 to 1916, the Cubans played independent baseball outside of the organized minor leagues. The 1915 and 1916 teams competed during part of the season in a new, independent Atlantic League, representing Long Branch in 1915 and Poughkeepsie in 1916. When they played in Madison in August 1916, they were competing in the Tri- County League, a short-season, independent professional league that featured both all-white and all-black teams. Because they frequently played against Negro league teams and some of the players may have been multiracial, baseball historians and statistical databases have classified the 1915‚Äì16 independent teams as part of Negro league baseball. Sunday baseball was not yet legal under blue laws in New York City, so major league teams often traveled to the seaside resort community of Long Branch to play Sunday games against the Cubans. According to research by David Skinner, the Cubans' record in these games was 10‚Äì24. ==Formation and minor leagues== Brothers Carlos and Richard (Ricardo) Henr√≠quez were born in Colombia and immigrated to the United States with their family as children, settling in New York City. In 1911 and 1912, Richard managed and played for an independent baseball team in the New Jersey resort town of Long Branch. In 1912, the team recruited several Cuban players, including Dolf Luque, pitcher, Mike Gonz√°lez, catcher, and Tom√°s Roma√±ach, shortstop. 1913 In 1913, the Long Branch Cubans joined a new Class D minor league, the New Jersey-New York League. Carlos Henr√≠quez was the club president and the league vice-president. His brother Richard was the playing manager. The team was composed of white players, most of them Cubans with professional playing experience in the Cuban League: *Mike Gonz√°lez, catcher, age 22, had debuted in the Cuban League in the winter of 1909/10.Figueredo 2003, p. 86. Gonz√°lez briefly played for the Boston Braves in 1912 and had signed to play with them again in 1913, but in April he was released to Long Branch with the Braves retaining an option. He played 17 seasons in the major leagues and 23 seasons in the Cuban League.Figueredo 2003, p. 501. In the Cuban League, he served as a manager until 1952‚Äì1953 and eventually became the owner of the Habana club.Figueredo 2003, pp. 363‚Äì364, 379.

The 1913 Long Branch Cubans went 65‚Äì29 and won the pennant by games. Luque led the league in pitching with a 22‚Äì5 record, followed by Villaz√≥n who went 20‚Äì8. Arag√≥n led the team in hitting with a .358 batting average, followed by Viol√° (.349), Gonz√°lez (.333), and Padr√≥n (.331). On May 11, the Cubans beat the New York Giants 5 to 1. Padr√≥n pitched and gave up only four hits. On August 6, the Boston Braves announced that they had purchased the contracts of Padr√≥n, Arag√≥n, Luque, and Villaz√≥n. The Braves also exercised their option on Gonz√°lez. The players remained with Long Branch, however, and none of them played for Boston that year. Padr√≥n and Gonz√°lez were released in September, while Luque was retained and played briefly for the Braves in 1914. 1914 The 1914 Long Branch Cubans Despite the team's success in 1913, the weekday attendance figure were considered to be disappointing. In March 1914, the Cubans received approval to move to Newark, with an agreement that the Cubans would not play while the Newark Indians of the International League were playing at home. The league, which had expanded to eight teams, changed its name to the \\"Atlantic League\\" at the same meeting. Returning players in 1914 included Henr√≠quez, Viol√°, Padr√≥n, and Arag√≥n. Henr√≠quez recruited several new players from Cuba: *Ricardo Torres, catcher, age 23, had debuted in the Cuban League the previous winter.Figueredo 2003, pp. 108, 110.

In early July, the Cubans moved from Newark back to Long Branch, where they finished the season. On July 19, Acosta pitched a 3‚Äì0 shutout against St. Louis Browns. Several newspapers reported that the game was a no-hitter, though one paper reported that he allowed two hits. The Cubans led the 1914 pennant race until late in the season, but Poughkeepsie passed them and won the title. Long Branch finished with a 59‚Äì31 record, three games behind Poughkeepsie. Arag√≥n led the league with a .443 batting average. Among the pitchers, Padr√≥n went 14‚Äì5, Acosta went 13‚Äì5, Mu√±oz went 10‚Äì6, and Baranda went 6‚Äì4. ==Independent and Negro league baseball== 1915 The Atlantic League folded after the 1914 season. Carlos Henr√≠quez led the creation of a new, independent Atlantic League and served as its president. The Long Branch Cubans withdrew from the league in mid-May. The team continued to play exhibition games against major league teams, and also played leading Negro league baseball teams. (U.S. Negro baseball teams were not organized into formal leagues until 1920.) The team's 1915 roster was mostly familiar names: Calvo, Roma√±ach, Viol√°, Padr√≥n, Hungo, Baranda, Torres and Acosta. The team added outfielder Tom√°s Calvo and pitcher Gerardo Ballesteros. On June 6, Acosta pitched another shutout against a major league team‚Äîthe New York Yankees‚Äîbeating them 5 to 0. An article in the Schenectady Gazette (July 22, 1916) said that the Cubans won seven of 14 games against major league opponents in 1915. Against Negro league baseball opponents, the Cubans were 12‚Äì12 in 1915. Roma√±ach led the team in batting, hitting .394, while Padr√≥n led the pitchers with a 3.00 earned run average (ERA). 1916 In 1916, Richard Henr√≠quez removed himself from the lineup and became a full- time manager. Mike Herrera joined the team at second base, and Hungo moved over to first. Herrera, age 23, had first played in the Cuban League in 1911/12 and would continue playing there until 1929/30.Figueredo 2003, p. 186. In the United States, he would play in both the Negro National League in 1920‚Äì1921 and 1928, and for the Boston Red Sox in the American League in 1925‚Äì1926. Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez, age 21, took over at third base, as Padr√≥n moved to the outfield to replace Tom√°s Calvo. Mu√±oz returned as pitcher to replace Acosta. The team began the year playing in Jersey City, then rejoined the independent Atlantic League, representing Poughkeepsie. In late July, they moved temporarily to Harlem, then in August moved to Madison, which they represented in the Tri-County League, a short-season, independent league in New Jersey. They played poorly in the Tri-County League; the Lincoln Giants, representing Dover, easily won the championship. In recorded play against Negro league baseball teams, the 1916 Cubans went 14‚Äì7. Jack Calvo led the team in hitting with a .368 average, and Mu√±oz led the pitchers with a 3.03 ERA. ==NotesReferences== * * ==External links== *The Henriquez Long Branch Cubans ‚Äì Brian McKenna, BaseballHistoryBlog.com Category:Defunct minor league baseball teams Category:Long Branch, New Jersey Category:Defunct baseball teams in New Jersey ","title":"Long Branch Cubans"},{"id":"35342049","text":"Illumina dye sequencing is a technique used to determine the series of base pairs in DNA, also known as DNA sequencing. The reversible terminated chemistry concept was invented by Bruno Canard and Simon Sarfati at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. It was developed by Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman of Cambridge University, who subsequently founded Solexa, a company later acquired by Illumina. This sequencing method is based on reversible dye-terminators that enable the identification of single nucleotides as they are washed over DNA strands. It can also be used for whole-genome and region sequencing, transcriptome analysis, metagenomics, small RNA discovery, methylation profiling, and genome-wide protein-nucleic acid interaction analysis. The DNA attaches to the flow cell via complementary sequences. The strand bends over and attaches to a second oligo forming a bridge. A polymerase synthesizes the reverse strand. The two strands release and straighten. Each forms a new bridge (bridge amplification). The result is a cluster of DNA forward and reverse strands clones. ==Overview== Illumina sequencing technology works in three basic steps: amplify, sequence, and analyze. The process begins with purified DNA. The DNA is fragmented and adapters are added that contain segments that act as reference points during amplification, sequencing, and analysis. The modified DNA is loaded onto a flow cell where amplification and sequencing will take place. The flow cell contains nanowells that space out fragments and help with overcrowding. Each nanowell contains oligonucleotides that provide an anchoring point for the adaptors to attach. Once the fragments have attached, a phase called cluster generation begins. This step makes about a thousand copies of each fragment of DNA and is done by bridge amplification PCR. Next, primers and modified nucleotides are washed onto the chip. These nucleotides have a reversible 3' fluorescent blocker so the DNA polymerase can only add one nucleotide at a time onto the DNA fragment. After each round of synthesis, a camera takes a picture of the chip. A computer determines what base was added by the wavelength of the fluorescent tag and records it for every spot on the chip. After each round, non-incorporated molecules are washed away. A chemical deblocking step is then used to remove the 3‚Äô fluorescent terminal blocking group.. The process continues until the full DNA molecule is sequenced. With this technology, thousands of places throughout the genome are sequenced at once via massive parallel sequencing. ==Procedure== Genomic Library After the DNA is purified a DNA library, genomic library, needs to be generated. There are two ways a genomic library can be created, sonification and tagmentation. With tagmentation, transposases randomly cuts the DNA into sizes between 50 to 500 bp fragments and adds adaptors simultaneously. A genetic library can also be generated by using sonification to fragment genomic DNA. Sonification fragments DNA into similar sizes using ultrasonic sound waves. Right and left adapters will need to be attached by T7 DNA Polymerase and T4 DNA ligase after sonification. Strands that fail to have adapters ligated are washed away. Double stranded DNA is cleaved by transposomes. The cut ends are repaired and adapters, indices, primer binding sites, and terminal sites are added to each strand of the DNA. Image based in part on illumina's sequencing video Adapters Adapters contain three different segments: the sequence complementary to solid support (oligonucleotides on flow cell), the barcode sequence (indices), and the binding site for the sequencing primer. Indices are usually six base pairs long and are used during DNA sequence analysis to identify samples. Indices allow for up to 96 different samples to be run together, this is also known as multiplexing. During analysis, the computer will group all reads with the same index together. Illumina uses a \\"sequence by synthesis\\" approach. This process takes place inside of an acrylamide-coated glass flow cell. The flow cell has oligonucleotides (short nucleotide sequences) coating the bottom of the cell, and they serve as the solid support to hold the DNA strands in place during sequencing. As the fragmented DNA is washed over the flow cell, the appropriate adapter attaches to the complementary solid support. Millions of oligos line the bottom of each flow cell lane. Bridge amplification Once attached, cluster generation can begin. The goal is to create hundreds of identical strands of DNA. Some will be the forward strand; the rest, the reverse. This is why right and left adapters are used. Clusters are generated through bridge amplification. DNA polymerase moves along a strand of DNA, creating its complementary strand. The original strand is washed away, leaving only the reverse strand. At the top of the reverse strand there is an adapter sequence. The DNA strand bends and attaches to the oligo that is complementary to the top adapter sequence. Polymerases attach to the reverse strand, and its complementary strand (which is identical to the original) is made. The now double stranded DNA is denatured so that each strand can separately attach to an oligonucleotide sequence anchored to the flow cell. One will be the reverse strand; the other, the forward. This process is called bridge amplification, and it happens for thousands of clusters all over the flow cell at once. Clonal amplification Over and over again, DNA strands will bend and attach to the solid support. DNA polymerase will synthesize a new strand to create a double stranded segment, and that will be denatured so that all of the DNA strands in one area are from a single source (clonal amplification). Clonal amplification is important for quality control purposes. If a strand is found to have an odd sequence, then scientists can check the reverse strand to make sure that it has the complement of the same oddity. The forward and reverse strands act as checks to guard against artefacts. Because Illumina sequencing uses DNA polymerase, base substitution errors have been observed, especially at the 3' end. Paired end reads combined with cluster generation can confirm an error took place. The reverse and forward strands should be complementary to each other, all reverse reads should match each other, and all forward reads should match each other. If a read is not similar enough to its counterparts (with which it should be a clone), an error may have occurred. A minimum threshold of 97% similarity has been used in some labs' analyses. Sequence by synthesis At the end of clonal amplification, all of the reverse strands are washed off the flow cell, leaving only forward strands. A primer attaches to the forward strands adapter primer binding site, and a polymerase adds a fluorescently tagged dNTP to the DNA strand. Only one base is able to be added per round due to the fluorophore acting as a blocking group; however, the blocking group is reversible. Using the four-color chemistry, each of the four bases has a unique emission, and after each round, the machine records which base was added. Once the color is recorded the fluorophore is washed away and another dNTP is washed over the flow cell and the process is repeated. dATPs, dTTPs, dGTPs, and dCTPs are washed over the cell separately so each nucleotide is able to be identified. Starting with the launch of the NextSeq and later the MiniSeq, Illumina introduced a new two- color sequencing chemistry. Nucleotides are distinguished by either one of two colors (red or green), no color (\\"black\\") or combining both colors (appearing orange as a mixture between red and green). Tagged nucleotides are added in order to the DNA strand. Each of the four nucleotides have an identifying label that can be excited to emit a characteristic wavelength. A computer records all of the emissions, and from this data, base calls are made. Once the DNA strand has been read, the strand that was just added is washed away. Then, the index 1 primer attaches, polymerizes the index 1 sequence, and is washed away. The strand forms a bridge again, and the 3' end of the DNA strand attaches to an oligo on the flow cell. The index 2 primer attaches, polymerizes the sequence, and is washed away. A polymerase sequences the complementary strand on top of the arched strand. They separate, and the 3' end of each strand is blocked. The forward strand is washed away, and the process of sequence by synthesis repeats for the reverse strand. Data analysis The sequencing occurs for millions of clusters at once, and each cluster has ~1,000 identical copies of a DNA insert. The sequence data is analyzed by finding fragments with overlapping areas, called contigs, and lining them up. If a reference sequence is known, the contigs are then compared to it for variant identification. This piecemeal process allows scientists to see the complete sequence even though an unfragmented sequence was never run; however, because Illumina read lengths are not very long (HiSeq sequencing can produce read lengths around 90 bp long), it can be a struggle to resolve short tandem repeat areas. Also, if the sequence is de novo and a reference doesn't exist, repeated areas can cause a lot of difficulty in sequence assembly. Additional difficulties include base substitutions (especially at the 3' end of reads) by inaccurate polymerases, chimeric sequences, and PCR-bias, all of which can contribute to generating an incorrect sequence. ==Comparison with other sequencing methods== This technique offers several advantages over traditional sequencing methods such as Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing requires two reactions, one for the forward primer and another for the reverse primer. Unlike Illumina, Sanger sequencing uses fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) to determine the sequence of the DNA fragment. ddNTPs are missing the 3' OH group and terminates DNA synthesis permanently. In each reaction tube, dNTPs and ddNTPs are added, along with DNA polymerase and primers. The ratio of ddNTPs to dNTPs matter since the template DNA needs to be completely synthesized, and an overabundance of ddNTPs will create multiple fragments of the same size and position of the DNA template. When the DNA polymerase adds a ddNTP the fragment is terminated and a new fragment is synthesized. Each fragment synthesized is one nucleotide longer than the last. Once the DNA template has been completely synthesized, the fragments are separated by capillary electrophoresis. At the bottom of the capillary tube a laser excites the fluorescently labeled ddNTPs and a camera captures the color emitted. Due to the automated nature of Illumina dye sequencing it is possible to sequence multiple strands at once and gain actual sequencing data quickly. With Sanger sequencing, only one strand is able to be sequenced at a time and is relatively slow. Illumina only uses DNA polymerase as opposed to multiple, expensive enzymes required by other sequencing techniques (i.e. pyrosequencing). ==Examples of use== Illumina sequencing has been used to research transcriptomes of the sweet potato and the gymnosperm genus Taxus. == References == Category:DNA sequencing methods ","title":"Illumina dye sequencing"},{"id":"35342053","text":"Sti≈æu dolari, and its second season, Sti≈æu dolari 2, is a Serbian TV series made in the production of Komuna Belgrade and the Radio Television of Serbia.

It is currently owned by Norfolk Southern (NS) and one of the largest yards in the United States. ==History== Conway Yard in 1941 Conway Yard was initially built by the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), in 1884, and expanded in the early 20th century. In 1905, it had a capacity of 8,967 cars and typically processed 2,300 cars per day. The enlarged yard was one of four built in Pennsylvania at that time as part of a major PRR expansion, the others being Altoona Yard, Enola Yard, and Harrisburg Yard. The PRR began rebuilding the yard in 1953. After an investment of $35 million ($ million today), the new eastbound yard opened in 1956, while the rebuilt westbound facilities opened in stages during 1957 and 1958.Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), Philadelphia, PA (1957). \\"Board of Directors Inspection Trip.\\" Report. Its newly expanded capacity was 9,000 cars per day, the largest in the United States, surpassing Enola Yard.

He was the news and executive editor of The Daily Ittefaq. He was captured from his residence by the Pakistan army with the help of Al-Badr and Razakar. He was not only a prominent journalist, but was also considered to be a good writer and translator. He was very close to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was the first to introduce investigative reporting into Bangla newspaper. During the 1971 liberation war, the country was occupied by the Pakistani army. During this time, Serajuddin Hossain wrote in the newspaper on behalf of the liberation war, and secretly helped the freedom fighters. ==Early life== Serajuddin Hossain was born in the village Sharushuna, in the district Magura. His father was Maulana Mazharul Haque and his mother was Ashrafunnessa. He was third of four siblings. His elder sister was Anowara Begum, and his elder brother Sharafuddin Hossain. His younger sister, was Lutfunnessa. Serajuddin Hossain lost his father when he was three years old. After his father died, the family moved to Jessore City to the home of his uncle, who was the headmaster of Jessore Zilla School. Serajuddin and his brother started studying in this school. He passed the matriculation examination from Jhikor Gacha High School in 1943, and received his I.A. from Jessore Madhusudan College in 1947, and received his B.A. from Kolkata's Islamia College (now Maulana Azad College). ==Marriage and family== In 1949, Hossain married Nurjahan Begum, the sister of his college friend Shamsuddin Molla, who was to become a politician. Hossain and Nurjahan Siraji had eight sons: Shameem Reza Noor, Shaheen Reza Noor, Fahim Reza Noor, Nasim Reza Noor, Saleem Reza Noor, Shaheed Reza Noor, Zaheed Reza Noor and Tawheed Reza Noor. ==Life as a journalist== When he was a B.A. student, he became an apprentice journalist at the Daily Azad, a Bengali newspaper published from Kolkata. After a short time, he was promoted to sub-editor. When the Daily Azad moved from Kolkata to Dhaka, he was appointed as the assistant news editor and eventually was promoted to be a news editor. As a news editor of Daily Azad, he played a large role in the Language Movement of Bangladesh.Smritipote Serajuddin Hossain, pg. 117, 118 In 1954, during a provincial election, Serajuddin Hossain supported the Jukto Front (United Front). As editor of the Daily Azad, Moulana Akram Khan, asked him to publish a report which would disclose that the bond between the leaders and parties of the Jukto Front had broken. A press release from Jukto Front said that the Jukto Front still existed. As an honest journalist, Serajuddin Hossain published a report which was based on Jukto Front's press release. The very next day Moulana Akraham Khan sacked him.Smritipote Serajuddin Hossain After that time, he worked as a junior editor of Franklin Publications. On 14 December 1954, he was hired as a news editor of the Daily Ittefaq. Serajuddin Hossain was a political journalist, but his work also spread over a number of other subjects. One of the subjects was investigative journalism. His brave work helped to save many kidnapped children, giving him worldwide recognition. During the 1960s, several children were being kidnapped. Serajuddin Hossain wanted to establish the fact that it was an organised crime, a single group of many criminals. Through his efforts, 72 children were saved. For that achievement he was nominated as the Best Journalist of International Press Institute.Smritipote Serajuddin Hossain, pg. 91, 92, 93Smritipote Serajuddin Hossain, pg. 127, 128 Hossain was a trade unionist as well, and was elected as the president of the East Pakistan Journalism Union for two terms. Hossain agreed with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's political point of view. He was a theoretician of the Bengali Nationalist Movement. In 1966, Ittefaq was banned by president Ayub Khan. Hossain then joined the news organisation, P.P.I, as the bureau chief. When Ittefaq was restarted in 1969, he returned to his old post as Ittefaqs news editor. From 1969 to 1971, he wrote political propaganda against Ayub Khan, thereby playing an important role in the 1969 uprising in East Pakistan through his newspaper. In 1970, he was appointed as the executive editor of the Daily Ittefaq. The Daily Ittefaq supported Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League party. Awami League won the 1970 general election of Pakistan with an overwhelming victory. The West Pakistani rulers did not want to give its power to Awami League. On the night 25 March 1971, the Pakistani army destroyed the Ittefaq office with a bomb because of its support of the Awami League. After two or three months, the newspaper started publication again because of the government's order. During this time, Serajuddin Hossain started published strong articles against the Pakistani government as he had joined with the freedom fighters and the East Pakistan government, then in exile. ==Death== In early December 1971, the Indian army joined with the Bangladesh freedom fighters in their battle against Pakistan. Knowing that their defeat was certain, the Pakistani rulers then decided to kill all of the Bangladeshi intellectuals. Between 10 and 14 December, the Pakistan army captured and killed the intellectuals. Serajuddin Hossain was the first victim of this killing. On the night of 10 December, a number of Pakistani soldiers, along with members of Al-Badr and Razakar, captured him at his residence in Chamelibag, Shantinagar. He never returned nor was his body ever found. On 3 November 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal ‚Äì a special Bangladeshi court set up by the government ‚Äì sentenced Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin and Ashrafuz Zaman Khan to death after the tribunal found him guilty in absentia of torture and murder of 18 intellectuals including Serajudding Hossain during 1971 Liberation war of Bangladesh. ==Legacy== Hossain was known as an honest journalist, and was responsible for Ittefaqs headlines and news selection. The Shaheed Sirajuddin Hossain College in Khajura, Jessore, is named for him. There is also a public library named for him in Aarpara, Magura. ==Honours== * Ekushey Padak for journalism (1977) * Manik Mia Gold Medal (2010) ==Publications== * Days Decisive * Itihash Kotha Kow * Mahioshi Nari * Bir o Birangona * Choto theke boro ==See also== * List of journalists killed in Bangladesh ==References * Crusade of a journalist: Serajuddin Hossain Category:1929 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Bangladeshi journalists Category:Maulana Azad College alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Journalists killed in Bangladesh Category:People killed in the Bangladesh Liberation War Category:People from Magura District Category:Recipients of the Ekushey Padak Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Serajuddin Hossain"},{"id":"35342600","text":"Kim Jong-Kun (ÍπÄÏ¢ÖÍ±¥, born May 10, 1969 in South Korea) is a South Korean footballer. == Player career == * 1994-2001 : Hyundai Horangi / Ulsan Hyundai Horangi == Honours == * Club ** K-League winners : 1996 * Player ** K-League Cup : Top Scorer (1998, 1999) ** Korean FA Cup : Top Scorer (1998) ==References External links == * Category:Living people Category:K League 1 players Category:Ulsan Hyundai FC players Category:1969 births Category:South Korean footballers Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Kim Jong-kun"},{"id":"35342638","text":"Legend Quest: The Legend of La Llorona (released in Hispanic America as La Leyenda de la Llorona) is an animated horror adventure comedy film based on the legend of La Llorona. The second installment of the Leyendas film saga, it is a sequel to La Leyenda de la Nahuala, which was a box-office success. Produced by √Ånima Estudios, the film was released in Mexico on October 21, 2011, grossing $55.4 million pesos. The English-subtitled version of the film was also released in direct-to-video and digital platforms in the United States, distributed by Pantelion Films and Lionsgate. ==Plot== Beto and his little sister Kika are asking for \\"calaverita\\" (a Mexican tradition of asking for candies and fruits from neighbors) in a village of Xochimilco on a deserted, dark and foggy night. Kika very loudly begins asking for candies, which causes Beto to become nervous. While waiting for Kika to come back from a house that is far down the street, Beto spots an eerie figure going in her direction. In order to save his sister, he calls out the ghost's name, \\"La Llorona\\"; she hears and precedes to chase after him. Kika finds Beto missing, looks for him, and finds him just in time to see him taken by La Llorona near the creek. Sometime later, a balloon with a ship basket carrying five companions is flying over the town. The companions are Leo San Juan, a young boy, Don Andres, an old knight (similar to Don Quijote), Alebrije, a fire- breathing colorful dragon-like creature and Moribunda and Finado, two skeleton-like kids resembling calaveras (sugar skulls). They're heading toward the village in response to Padre Tello's letter which asked for their help. They summon a ghost friend Teodora, who has helped them in previous adventures, but she disappears right before the storm after teasing Leo. During the storm, Moribunda falls out of the basket, and Leo saves her, but falls from the balloon into Kika's boat, who's sailing down a river at the time, possibly looking for Beto. Kika accidentally knocks Leo into the water, then discovers his letter from Padre Tello, and then accidentally hits him with her paddle, knocking him out (she pulls him out of the water offscreen). Kika sees the damaged balloon he's fallen from heading toward La Isla de las Mu√±ecas (Dolls' Island). San Juan wakes up at Kika's house under her and Beto's mother's care. The mother, Rosa, tells him a story of La Llorona, whose name was actually Yoltzin instead of Mar√≠a. Yoltzin moved to Xochimilco with her two kids: Ollin and Tonatiuh. She sold flowers to provide for her family and became well-liked in the village. Everything changed one day when they were coming back home to find their house on fire. Yoltzin jumped off the boat, desperate to save the house, but forgot her kids on the boat, which drifted away with them still on board. When she realized that they were floating away, it was too late and they disappeared without a trace. Villagers helped her searching for the kids. Days later, though, Ollin and Tonatiuh were found dead near a channel, possibly due to drowning and their bodies must have washed up onshore. Yoltzin didn't accept her children's death. She was driven crazy with grief and remorse and died, with having nothing left to live for. After her death, the villagers started to hear ghostly moans. Yoltzin had become La Llorona, a specter who came out at night to kidnap children, though with no intent to harm them; rather, she seemed to want to take care of them, maybe to make up for failing to take care of her own children or actually believing they are her children. Padre Tello followed La Llorona for years, trying to find out how to appease La Llorona until he disappeared. San Juan leaves Kika's house to find his friends and figures out the mystery of where Beto and the other kidnapped kids are with help of Padre Tello's journal. Kika follows him, telling Leo that he needs her. La Llorona attacks Leo and Kika, injuring Leo, but Kika helps him and listens to his plans to find the old church where Ollin and Tonatiuh's graves are. Padre Tello's book says that \\"Yoltzin has to see\\" the graves to be at peace. Once again, Leo and Kika are chased by La Llorona, but this time Kika is kidnapped and Leo loses her trail. Meanwhile, at Isla de las Mu√±ecas (Doll's Island), Andres is tangled in vines. After a lot of screaming, he is rescued from the puppets by Alebrije, who was all covered in green slime after falling in the lake and mistaken for a monster. Andres and Alebrije free an old man from a cursed hand puppet named Pecas, who was animated by the tears of La Llorona, who had previously cried at the creek and had been forcing the old man to make puppets for her. The old man thanks them and tells them where to find La Llorona. Leo San Juan asks Teodora to help him seek La Llorona and distract her while he looks for the old church where Yoltzin's kids were buried. Leo goes into a sunken church, and inside he finds Kika and other kids sleeping. He sees that La Llorona has been taking care of them and that they were unharmed. He runs deep down in the church until he finds the church's crypt and searches for Ollin and Tonatiuh's graves. He finds a broken part of the kids' graves when he's looking for his dropped necklace (with a picture of his deceased mother inside) and puts it back into the grave, fixing it. Kika angers La Llorona, telling her to let the other kids go, and she almost has her soul taken by La Llorona but Leo saves her. La Llorona grabs Leo and starts taking his soul, causing him to pass out, then captures his friends by animating vines that had overtaken the sunken church. When she is about to hurt them, Leo calls out to her and shows her child's name in the grave. When La Llorona sees their names, she begins to see the unconscious Leo and Kika as her children, dead. Overcome with guilt, she collapses to her knees and cries. However, all the tombstones begin to glow and Ollin and Tonatiuh appear. She is reunited with her kids and thanks Leo for his help. Leo sees his mother one last time while he is unconscious. Soon, all of them (except Leo) depart from the living world and go to the world of the dead. Other kidnapped children wake up including Beto. Back in the village Leo and his friends say farewell to the villagers, then get ready to go back to their hometown when Padre Godofredo's ghost appears and urges them to help another town in distress. He explains that Xochitl, a friend of theirs, who had also helped them before, was taken captive by mummies in Guanajuato. They then sail off to Guanajuato in order to save her. ==Voice cast== *Benny Emmanuel as Leo San Juan, the main protagonist *Andr√©s Bustamante as Don Andres/Pujo *Rafael Incl√°n as Alebrije *Mayte Cordeiro as Teodora *Monica Del Carmen as Kika *Erick Canete as Beto *Rosario Zuniga as Rosa, Beto and Kika's mom *Mercedes Hernandez as Yoltzin *Rocio Lara as La Llorona *Miguel Couturier as Willy/Padre Godofredo *Jesus Guzman as Pecas/Finado *Valeria Russek as Leo's Mom *Humberto Solorzano as Padre Tello/Tiro *Romina Marroquin as Moribunda *Carlos Del Campo as Guide voice Alebrije ==Box office== This film opened at #4, earning $8.3 million pesos (USD$0.6 million) at the Mexican box office.

Flora of North America. to 3 meters in maximum height. The branches are often bright red in color, while the smaller twigs are yellowish, reddish, or brownish, with a coating of hairs. The leaves are generally oval in shape and have smooth or serrated margins. The shiny leaf blades are up to 5 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a catkin. The species is dioecious. Flowering occurs in May and June. The shiny leaves of this willow help distinguish it from other willows in the habitat, all of which have waxy leaves. This species is very similar to Salix boothii, a plant that has certain flavonoids that are lacking in Salix arizonica. They can also be distinguished by the size and shape of the leaves. This willow occurs in three main areas, the White Mountains of Arizona (including Mt. Baldy), the plateaus of Utah, and the Rocky Mountains of southern Colorado and New Mexico. This plant grows in subalpine meadows and cienegas and on streambanks. It occurs in spots where there is moisture available year-round. Other species in the habitat include Dasiphora floribunda, Caltha leptosepala, Carex spp., Deschampsia caespitosa, Pedicularis groenlandica, Picea engelmannii, Poa pratensis and other willow species, such as S. monticola and S. planifolia. The main threat to this species is grazing by livestock and wild ungulates. Animals reduce the plants' biomass and height as well as their survival and ability to reproduce sexually.Maschinski, J. (2001). Impacts of ungulate herbivores on a rare willow at the southern edge of its range. Biological Conservation 101(1) 119-30.

It is based in Ottawa, with a second office in Vancouver and is run by a board of directors who have, or have had, personal experiences of poverty. Canada has yet to develop consistent poverty indicators, which makes it difficult to effectively help the estimated 1 in 7 or 4.8 million people living in conditions of poverty. This is what CWP is working to change. == Origins == CWP was founded in 1971 as a registered charity. It was an outgrowth of the Poor People's Conference which took place in Toronto in 1971, organized by the National Council of Welfare (NCW), under the auspices of the Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfare. The original name of the organization was the National Anti-Poverty Organization (NAPO). This name was changed to Canada Without Poverty (CWP) in 2009. It has had partnerships with the Red Tents Campaign, Dignity for All: the campaign for a poverty-free Canada, Voices ‚ÄìVoix, and the BC Poverty Reduction Coalition. The charity, from the beginning, was organized to become a main umbrella of nationwide anti-poverty activists; its mandate is identify the causes of poverty and to promote poverty eradication and human rights. Beginning in 1973, NAPO presented its first research document on hunger and food costs to the Federal Parliament. It continued, from this first campaign, to address poverty-related issues whether advocating for better health care, higher unemployment insurance benefits, fairer taxation, family benefits, recognition of homelessness and women's poverty, and/or the fundamental human rights of people living in poverty. It has acted as liaison between community groups and the Parliament in power. In the 1990s NAPO began to expand its forums to regional and international discussions about poverty eradication, including concerns about homelessness, women's poverty issues, wage inequality and the growing attack on the poor, the result of neoliberal shifts towards the downsizing of government and dismantling of social programs. From addressing the UN as an NGO to co-hosting conferences at the regional and international level, NAPO not only increased its presence but drew powerful connections between reality of poverty in Canada and growing poverty as a result of globalization. In the 1993 it convened a second Poor People's Conference and co-hosted a UN Poverty Roundtable in 1998 to deal poverty in the Americas. In the 2000s it published documents including Voices: Women, Poverty and Homelessness in Canada, a study of female homelessness in Canada, and began a national campaign for a new minimum wage. It also championed the rights of homeless people and won a legal case against the City of Winnipeg which was forced to repeal a by-law prohibiting panhandling. == Mission == The mission of CWP is to relieve poverty in Canada by educating Canadians about the human and financial cost of poverty and by identifying public policy solutions. These 'costs' include financial and 'human'. CWP works with people from government, business and community groups to influence legislative priorities at the federal level regarding income and social support needs. CWP uses a human rights framework which states that all Canadians have a right to equality and dignity and expects social institutions to uphold the values of caring, responsibility, and accountability based on UN concepts of fundamental human rights. Louise Arbour, Chief Prosecutor at the Hague International War Tribunals and an Honorary Director of CWP, has stated \\"poverty prevails as the gravest human rights challenge in the world\\". In Canada, inequalities of access to social and economic resources contribute significantly to poverty levels across Canada, i.e., those in poverty are often First Nation people, immigrants and refugees, single adults between the ages of 45-64, and single mothers with children, disabled, those in the lowest-paying jobs, full or part-time. People in poverty in Canada more often access food banks, are often homeless, or in low-cost, sub-standard housing; they are part of the 'working poor' who rely on low wages, or are stuck in the poverty trap of welfare, and face hunger. == Current activities and impacts/successes == In 2006 the Federal Government cut the funding to CWP. This seriously impeded their work. Other anti-poverty groups also experienced funding cuts. The Canadian Council for International Co-operation, a group involved in global poverty reduction and connected to CWP, is threatened with complete funding cuts. However, the organization has refused to simply stop operating. In 2009, Canada Without Poverty adopted a new logo that \\"symbolizes rising above one's poverty line towards a bright future\\". The need for greater pressure is evident in the erosion of concern of the Federal government to address poverty. Poverty deeply impacts individuals, families, society and costs governments perhaps as much as $80 billion annually. Individually it is characterized by people having to make tough choices between meeting basic needs like deciding whether to eat, buy new shoes, pay the rent etc. Studies have found poverty is strongly associated with poorer health, physical and emotional, alcohol and drug abuse, recidivism in the criminal justice system, class divides that threaten Canadian social stability, and higher early mortality rates among those living in poverty.  Campaigns  CWP is now involved in a number of significant, comprehensive campaigns including: \\"Dignity for All: The Campaign for a Poverty-Free Canada\\", a campaign that was co-founded in 2009 with Citizens for Public Justice. This campaign focuses on three fundamental \\"wants\\" in order to address the \\"structural causes of poverty in Canada\\" . These goals include the establishment of legislative changes to create an Act of Parliament which would ensure ongoing federal commitment and accountability mechanisms, the establishment of a federal poverty strategy, and adequate income supports for Canadians. This project is supported by over 550 Canadian anti-poverty groups (for example, Acorn Canada, and Alberta Human Rights Commission and almost 130 Members of Parliament and 15 Senators. The goal is to increase the number of groups and individuals committed to produce pressure on the government to act for Canadians demanding poverty eradication. CWP was involved in writing Bill C-233, An Act to eliminate poverty in Canada (formerly Bill C-545). The original bill died on the floor in 2010, although it was reintroduced into Parliament by NDP MP Jean Crowder. ==Organizational features == Current and past CWP Board of Directors are primarily drawn from poverty activists, all of whom have lived in poverty themselves, either as children and/or as adults. In 2012 there were nine board members who lived in regions across the country. All continued to work as activists representing various communities from First Nations to immigrants to urban and rural citizens. In September 2012, Leilani Farha took the reins of the organization as its executive director. Leilani is a leading expert and advocate on economic and social human rights, especially for women. She has a long history promoting the right to adequate housing, equality and non-discrimination in housing in Canada and internationally. Prior to joining Canada Without Poverty, Leilani was the executive director of the Centre for Equality Rights in Accommodation for 12 years. She has extensive experience addressing homelessness, poverty and inequality in Canada through advocacy, casework, litigation, research and community based work. She has been at the forefront of applying international human rights law to anti-poverty issues in Canada, and is known internationally for her work on housing rights and women's economic and social rights. In June 2014, Leilani was appointed as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing which she does in addition to her role as CWP Executive Director. There is also an Honorary Board, made up of Canadian political leaders including former Federal NDP leaderEd Broadbent, former Prime Minister Joe Clark, former Member of Parliament Monique B√©gin and former Canadian Supreme Court Justice Louise Arbour. The fifth Honorary Board member is Ovide Mercredi, a Cree who serves as the Chief of the Misipawistik Cree Nation. In February 2012, Elizabeth May, the Green Party of Canada leader joined an all-party panel discussion on poverty organized by the Dignity for All Campaign to ensure adequate discussion on issues relating to the low- income population remain on the public agenda. In 2015 CWP employs four employees to fulfill all administrative affairs, including fund raising, communications, and organizing the various events and campaigns along with the assistance of numerous volunteers. == References  *pi.library.yorku.ca Category:Charities based in Canada ","title":"Canada Without Poverty"},{"id":"35343142","text":"Pritam Singh (born 2 August 1976) is a Singaporean author, lawyer and politician who has served as the secretary-general of the Workers' Party of Singapore since 2018.

A termite shield is a sheet metal fabrication used in light frame construction to reduce the movement of termites from the soil into wood framing members such as floor joists and studs. Although there are several types of non chemical termite barriers now in use, termite shields are the original. == Materials == Termite shields can be made up of various materials. One type of termite shield is made from various sheet metals including galvanized steel, terne, copper, or aluminum. The metal is formed to fit between the top of the foundation wall and the bottom of the wood sill plate. The edges of the termite shield are typically hemmed, extended slightly beyond the face of the wall, and turned down to form a drip edge which diverts water running down the face of the wall and reduce the movement of subterranean termites from the soil up into the wood framing members. Termite shields will not protect a building from termite activity, but help make termite activity more visible. Lately, granite and Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shield can be installed into tiny brick open spaces where termites can enter the building surrounding the whole perimeter of the property. The termite shield is too thick for the termites to chew and penetrate the material forcing the termites to migrate into the open where they can be more easily eradicated. The benefits of using this type of material is that they are sustainable to the environment being awarded Environmental Choice Declaration from the Environmental Labelling Association. Other benefits include being cheaper than metals, and can be coupled with other shield protection systems. == Problems == One problem with termite shields is the gaps which exist at seams and at openings where steel reinforcing bars penetrate the metal shield. Since many species of subterranean termites can enter through openings >1/20 Inch (1.27 mm), these gaps must be sealed with a sealant known to block termites. Additionally, termite barrier sealant should be used underneath the shield, so termites are forced to go to the exterior of the structures. == Other materials == There are two other materials called \\"termite barriers\\" rather than \\"termite shields\\" which have been evaluated by the International Code Council.

It is found on the eastern coasts of North America and the Caribbean Sea where it feeds on colonial sea squirts. ==Description== MaritigrellaMaritigrella: \\"little tiger of the sea\\". crozierae is a large flatworm. The upper side of its body is boldly striped in yellow and black. The underside is creamy white with a sucker near the centre. The margin is ruffled, rimmed with orange and fringed with small orange tentacles. It has a tubular pharynx and two tentacles at the front of its head, formed from folds of parts of the front of its body. Just behind these is its brain, with two elongated clusters of ocelli (eyespots) on either side. It usually grows to about in length and occasional individuals may reach twice this size. == Distribution == Maritigrella crozierae is found in shallow water in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Its range extends from South Carolina to Florida and includes the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda. == Biology == Maritigrella crozierae is common in the Indian River Lagoon where it feeds exclusively on the mangrove tunicate, Ecteinascidia turbinata. In other parts of its range it feeds on other sea squirts but seems to become habituated to the species it first ate. It everts its pharynx into a zooid and sucks out the interior tissues. A colony of mangrove tunicates is often home to two flatworms, each eating about 19 zooids a day. The tunicate produces a secondary metabolite called trabectedin which has been shown to have anti- tumour properties. As it feeds, the flatworm gradually builds up the concentration of this chemical in its body. For this reason, it may be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry as a source of this compound which has been approved for medical use in the European Union. Maritigrella crozierae is a simultaneous hermaphrodite, which means that an individual has both male and female gonads at the same time. Fertilisation is internal by hypodermic copulation. One individual approaches another from behind, rears up and falls forward, piercing the other with a fine stylet and inserting white bundles of sperm. Often the second individual reciprocates and both are inseminated at the same time. About 48 hours later, several clumps of cream coloured eggs are laid. These later hatch into larvae known as Muller's larvae which are planktonic. == References == Category:Turbellaria Category:Animals described in 1939 ","title":"Maritigrella crozierae"},{"id":"35343410","text":"Presidente is a brand of Pilsner beer that is owned and produced by Cervecer√≠a Nacional Dominicana (CND) at several breweries in the Dominican Republic.

The beer was named in honor of then Dominican president Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo. Presidente was initially launched as a dark beer and acquired limited success, yet in the 1960s Presidente was transformed into the pilsner that is recognized today. In 1986, the brewery was acquired by Dominican cigarette company Grupo Le√≥n Jimenes. In 2012, Anheuser-Busch InBev's Brazilian unit AmBev agreed to buy a controlling stake in the Dominican Republic-based brewer Cerveceria Nacional Dominicana (CND) from Grupo Leon Jimenes for over $1.2 billion, forming the biggest beverage company in the Caribbean. ==Sponsorship partners== Some of Presidente's export partners include the University of Miami Hurricanes, the Miami Marlins, and the Miami Heat.

The group consists of sisters China Anne McClain, Sierra McClain, and Lauryn McClain. The group was formed in 2005 as the 3mcclaingirls. All three sisters starred in the film Daddy's Little Girls (2007), for which they released the single \\"Daddy's Girl\\". They signed with Hollywood Records in 2011 under the moniker the McClain Sisters. Their first notable performance was at the 2011 Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade. They released their first song \\"Rise\\" in March 2012 for the Disneynature film Chimpanzee, and that same month the group was the opening act for Big Time Rush on their Better with U Tour in Houston. The next month they performed at the 2012 White House Easter Egg Roll. In November of that year, they performed their debut single \\"Go\\" and released it shortly after performing the song on A.N.T. Farm. In December 2013, the group left the record label, and changed their name to McClain. Later that month they released \\"He Loves Me\\". In 2014, McClain performed at the 2014 Radio Disney Music Awards; performed their first headlining concert at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California; and toured the United States, performing at numerous state fairs. Their last single as McClain was \\"Feelin' Like\\", which was released in 2016. Thereafter the group went on hiatus from 2016 until June 2020, during which the sisters pursued their acting careers. In June 2020 the group returned with a new name, Thriii, and released their single ‚ÄúMy Sanity‚Äù. Their first high-profile performance under the name was at Radio Disney Presents ARDYs Summer Playlist. ==Early life== Sierra Aylina McClain was born on March 16, 1994, Lauryn Alisa McClain was born on January 9, 1997, and China Anne McClain was born on August 25, 1998. All three sisters were born and raised in Decatur, Georgia. The sisters grew up watching Disney films and musical classics, and come from an artistic and musical family. Their father, Michael McClain, is a music producer who produced Solange Knowles' debut album Solo Star (2002). Their mother, Shontell McClain, is a songwriter and former screenwriter. The sisters also have a little brother, Gabriel McClain, who was born on April 17, 2001. In 2004, the sisters became interested in music when they watched their father write and produce songs. The girls began to write songs, choreograph and dance. In addition to acting, singing, and dancing, all three sisters can play the guitar, bass, and piano. == Career ==  2005‚Äì2010: 3mcclaingirls  In 2005, the sisters' father had a friend over who was a music executive. The music executive heard the sisters sing and encouraged director Rob Hardy to audition China for his 2005 feature film The Gospel. China was cast as the character Alexis and her sisters were in the supporting cast. The sisters then became serious about a musical career and formed the girl group called the 3mcclaingirls. They recorded their first song, \\"Silly Games\\". The song was produced by their father, Michael McClain, and written by their mother, Shontell McClain. In 2006 China joined the main cast of Tyler Perry's House of Payne as Jazmine Payne and Sierra made guest appearances. In 2007 the group starred in the film Daddy's Little Girls as the James sisters. In 2008 the group recorded the song \\"Daddy's Girl\\", inspired by the movie, and released it exclusively on MySpace. In 2008 the group began posting videos on their YouTube channel of themselves singing covers of songs. They also continued pursuing their acting careers separately, making various appearances in films and on television.  2011‚Äì2012: McClain Sisters and Hollywood Records  The sisters originally planned to use the name III as their group name, the number representing the three McClain girls in the group, but that idea was scrapped. They instead changed their group name to the McClain Sisters. That same year China landed her own show on the Disney Channel called A.N.T. Farm. On October 11, 2011, the A.N.T. Farm soundtrack was released on which the group released two songs: \\"Perfect Mistake\\" and \\"Electronic Apology\\".

He is best known as a long-serving former member of the British band Faithless. He has the rare accolade of having performed on two of the UK Top 40 Best-Selling Studio Albums of All Time, His family is of Welsh descent from the Aberdare / Cwmaman area, and his relatives include Stuart Cable, formerly the drummer of Welsh rock band Stereophonics and BBC broadcaster, who died in 2010. He was educated at Highgate School. ==Musical biography== Having fronted the pop band Troy Tempest during the mid-1980s, Nunn gave up music to study languages, eventually teaching English at Lyc√©e Boucher de Perthes in Picardy, Northern France. The death of a mutual friend in 1989 saw him return to London to form The Big Truth Band with Jamie Catto (later of Faithless and 1 Giant Leap, and Paul Herman (writer and producer of Dido and Corinne Bailey-Rae) with whom he extensively toured the UK university circuit, releasing only one EP The Summer EP on Akashic Records. In 1993, Nunn joined Heavy Stereo, (later to sign to Creation Records), fronted by Gem Archer (later of Oasis), and in 1994 toured with the heavy rock band Stiltskin (who had already achieved number one status in many European countries with their Levis' Jeans advertisement soundtrack \\"Inside\\"), simultaneously recording new material for the band with their guitarist and producer Peter Lawlor (although this was never released). In 1994, Nunn regrouped with Paul Herman to form the rock trio Bee alongside drummer Matt Benbrook (latter of Faithless, Skinny, and writer and producer of Paolo Nutini). The band caught the attention of producer Rollo, and together they produced a demo recording, but failed to gain industry recognition. When Bee disbanded in 1995, Rollo asked all three members to join a new studio project he was already working on with Maxi Jazz (who had been working with The Soul Food Cafe System and Jah Wobble), and the DJ/keyboardist Sister Bliss, to be named Faithless. The resulting studio sessions formed the basis of the band's debut album 'Reverence'. Alongside his tenure with Faithless (1995-late 2006), Nunn contributed bass guitar performances to releases by Santana, Corinne Bailey-Rae, Dido No Angel and Life For Rent albums, both among the UK Top 40 Best-Selling Studio Albums of All Time, Sister Bliss, Freakpower, Gabrielle, Skinny, The Happening, Dina Vass, Pauline Taylor, Slovo and R. Kelly. He has multi-instrumental, writing and production credits for Dido's Life For Rent album and has appeared as a guest with 1 Giant Leap and Tim Booth (James) for their TV appearances. As a writer and producer he has also contributed writing and production to Polly Scattergood, Kelly Erez, Dan Akio and Paul Cattermole (formerly of S Club 7). In 2009, he formed the studio project 'Tribadelica', with the Jamaican percussionist / vocalist Asambai, recording material for an intended album release. This was halted three months into production following Asambai's accidental death. ==Equipment== For live work, Nunn has used several Fender Jazz Basses, notably a black 1967 (nicknamed D'Artagnan) which he used for most of his Faithless touring work, and a 1990 fretless Wal Custom Bass Mk 1. In the studio he has mainly used 1960s Fender Jazz Basses, a 1989 fretted Wal Custom Mk 1, and a 1962 Gibson EB2. For touring he has mainly used a pair of Ampeg SVT Classic heads and 810 cabs. His current setup is a 1963 Fender Jazz Bass and an Ashdown Drophead LB-30. ==Industrial history== Briefly employed in A&R; by Champion Records' boss Mel Medalie during the early days of Faithless, he was the managing director of Faithless' production companies until he left the band in 2006. In 2004, at the invitation of Feargal Sharkey, he joined the UK Government task force the 'Live Music Forum', to evaluate the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on the performance of live music. In 2007 he formed Thaitonic Productions with songwriter Alex Von Soos (All Saints co-writer) to develop new artists. The same year, he was elected a member of the London Regional Committee of the UK Musicians Union for whom he has been a frequent industry panel member. In 2009, he joined Radio One Samui as a broadcaster, recording the highest listening figures at the station for \\"The 'O' Show\\". In 2010, he managed and performed with the Thailand-based jazz band The Samui Syndicate, featuring Grammy Award-winning singer Keithen Carter (best known for The Mazda 'Zoom Zoom Zoom' advertisement) and Australian jazz pianist Josh Evans. The same year, he became the co-owner of The Spirit House, a cultural community centre in Maenam, Koh Samui, hosting local and international live music. ==Personal life== Nunn lives in Koh Samui, Thailand. He holds a Postgraduate Certificate in Education and currently teaches at The International School of Samui where he was formerly Director of Music and Head of Senior School. ==References== Category:English bass guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:Male bass guitarists Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:People educated at Highgate School ","title":"Aubrey Nunn"},{"id":"35343436","text":"≈ªelichowska may refer to: ;People *Aleksandra ≈ªelichowska (born 1984), Polish figure skater ;Geography *Ku≈∫nica ≈ªelichowska, village in Czarnk√≥w-Trzcianka County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland *Pilcza ≈ªelichowska, village in DƒÖbrowa County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland *Wola ≈ªelichowska, village in DƒÖbrowa County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in southern Poland ==See also== *≈ªelechowa *≈ªelich√≥w (disambiguation) ","title":"≈ªelichowska"},{"id":"35343443","text":"Bathylagoides is a genus of deep-sea smelts. ==Species== Three recognized species are in this genus: * Bathylagoides argyrogaster (Norman, 1930) (silver deepsea smelt) * Bathylagoides greyae (A.

Individuals with the condition typically develop difficulty swallowing. The outpouchings represent the ducts of submucosal glands of the esophagus. It typically affects individuals in their sixth and seventh decades of life. While it is associated with certain chronic conditions, particularly alcoholism, diabetes and gastroesophageal reflux disease, the cause of the condition is unknown. Treatment involves medications to treat concomitant conditions such as reflux (such as proton pump inhibitors) and esophageal spasm, and dilation of strictures in the esophagus. ==Signs and symptoms== As the condition involves alterations in the wall of the esophagus and reduction in the calibre of the esophagus, the symptoms of esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis are primarily related to swallowing. Difficulty swallowing solids is a typical symptom. In extreme cases, food may become impacted in the esophagus. Some individuals may have bleeding in the esophagus, manifesting as vomiting of blood or as melena stools. With the reduction of oral intake due to difficulty swallowing, affected individuals usually lose weight. ==Cause== The cause of esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis is uncertain. It has been hypothesized that the pseudodiverticulae are not a primary phenomenon, but rather are secondary to a chronic irritant to the esophagus, or to accentuation in the movement of the esophagus (hypermotility). Both of these factors lead to obstruction or compression of the subucosal ducts of the esophagus, leading to the formation of the pseudodiverticulae. Autopsy specimens of individuals with esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis have confirmed that the flask-like openings are indeed dilated submucosal glands. The condition is associated with alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. ==Diagnosis== Esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis is typically diagnosed at the time of endoscopy of the esophagus. Endoscopy shows evidence of the pseudodiverticulae, which are typically numerous, appear like pits in the wall, and may be preferentially located in the upper esophagus. The mucosal lining of the esophagus may be inflamed, and this can be seen on endoscopy or on biopsy; the mucosa, however, may also be normal if esophagitis is not the cause of the pseudodiverticulosis. The condition must also be excluded from esophageal cancer, which may be done at the time of endoscopy, or which may require esophageal biopsy. Pseudodiverticulae may also be seen on barium swallow imaging of the esophagus. The appearance is of flask-shaped pseudodiverticulae, which may be present in the entire esophagus diffusely, or may be segmental. The pseudodiverticulae may be seen preferentially in the lower esophagus on barium swallow also. Strictures or narrowings in the esophagus may also be seen, typically in the upper esophagus. As esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis is also associated with motility disturbances of the esophagus, manometry testing of esophageal pressures may provide information to assist in the diagnosis. Irregularity in the contractions of the esophagus, prominent tertiary contractions of the esophagus, or lack of esophageal contraction (aperistalsis) have all been reported on manometric testing of the esophagus. ==Management== Several treatment regimens have been described for esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis. Because the condition is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, proton pump inhibitors as anti-acid medications are used to treat the condition. If the condition is associated with spasm of the esophagus, antispasmodic medications such as butylscopolamine can be used. Dilation of areas of stricturing using esophageal bougies may provide relief of swallowing symptoms. The pseudodiverticulae themselves rarely cause symptoms, and treatment is not directed toward them. ==Prognosis== Periodic surveillance of the esophagus with endoscopy has been recommended due to a reported association of the condition with esophageal cancer. Rarely a condition called peridiverticulitis, associated with inflammation around the pseudodiverticulae has been reported over time leading to chest pain or pain while swallowing. ==Epidemiology== Approximately 200 cases of esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis have been reported. One study of over 14000 barium swallow x-rays identified the condition in 0.15% of individuals who had the procedure. While the disease has been reported as occurring at any time during life, it most frequently affects individuals in their 50s and 60s. ==References== Category:Esophagus disorders ","title":"Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis"},{"id":"35343634","text":"Ronda Carman (2012)Ronda Rice Carman (born April 20, 1970) is an American writer and founder of All the Best: A Passport to Stylish Living, Designers at Home: Personal Reflections on Stylish Living and Ronda Carman Fine Fabrics.

He served as the Cabinet Minister of Finance & Planning and Forests departments in the Government of Maharashtra, Previously, he was the Maharashtra State President for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from 2010 to 2013 and the Minister of Tourism and Consumer Protection in the Government of Maharashtra from 1995 to 1999. In 2014, he was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly to serve for a fifth consecutive term. He also holds additional charge as the Guardian Minister of Chandrapur and Wardha districts. ==Early life and political career== Sudhir Mungantiwar was born on 30 July 1962 in Chandrapur district in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. He started his political career at the age of 17 when he was appointed as the Secretary of the Students Union at the Sardar Patel Mahavidyalaya in Chandrapur and has remained politically active since then. In 1989 and 1991, he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Chandrapur, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. He completed his M.Phil from Nagpur University and in 1993, became the Vice President of the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) in Maharashtra. In 1995, he won the Legislative Assembly elections from Chandrapur with a record margin of around 55,000 votes and eventually became the Minister of Tourism and Consumer Protection in the 'BJP-Shiv Sena' alliance's Maharashtra government, a position he held till 1999. He continued to rise in the ranks of the Bhartiya Janata Party, becoming the General Secretary of BJP's Maharashtra State unit in 1996 and the National Vice President of Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha in 2001. In 2010, Mungantiwar was unanimously elected as the Maharashtra State President for the BJP. He replaced senior leader Nitin Gadkari, who became the party's national president. In 2014, after the Maharashtra Assembly elections, Mungantiwar became the Minister of Finance & Planning and Forests in the Devendra Fadnavis ministry. ==Minister of Finance & Planning, Forests== As the Minister of Finance & Planning departments, Sudhir Mungantiwar played an integral role in chalking out the 'Shetkari Sanmaan Yojna' - Maharashtra state government's decision to waive around 34,000 crore worth of farmers' loans. In his 2015 budget speech, he announced his decision to implement an 'Evidence Based Project Management System', making Maharashtra the first state in the country to implement such a system. He also played a key role in passing landmark decisions like increasing the insurance coverage for government employees and providing 180 days of paid maternity leave to women government employees. He also helped set up a 'War Room' in association with the UN to track policy and development projects in the state. In 2016, he led efforts to improve business and trade relations with Mauritius. This included the decision by the Mauritius government to waive 40 per cent tax paid by film-makers who would want to shoot in Mauritius. He also formed committees to recommend measures to improve efficiency and transparency in the areas of governmental procurement, school and college fee structures, and disbursement of scholarships. In 2017, under his leadership, the offices of the Finance and Forest departments in Mantralaya were awarded the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) certification ‚Äî ISO 9001:2015. It became the first elected officials' office in India to receive this certification. As the Minister of Forests, he initiated a massive state-wide plantation drive which aimed at planting 50 crore saplings by 2019. As part of this initiative, 2.81 crore saplings were planted on a single day, July 1 2016 - earning the initiative a place in the 'Limca Book of Records'. Another 5.43 crore saplings were planted against a target of 4 crore in 2017. He also led the state government to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev's Isha Foundation to carry out large scale plantation along the banks of rivers in Maharashtra under an initiative called Rally for Rivers. Similar MoUs was also signed with Minister of Road Transport and Highways of India, Nitin Gadkari and the then Minister of Railways, Suresh Prabhu for tree plantation along roads and railway lines respectively. Mungantiwar also approved the establishment of Maharashtra State Zoo Authority, Nature Tourism Board, Mangroves Protection Authority and Maharashtra State Wildlife Fund for better administration and conservation efforts. He also helped launch - Maharashtra Harit Sena or Green Army - a volunteer group which aims to participate in plantation and conservation efforts and 'Hello Forest' - a dedicated helpline number for all state-wide forest and conservation related issues. ==Awards and recognition== He was join bjp Over his career in public service, Sudhir Mungantiwar has been awarded many times recognizing his political performance and social initiatives. He was named 'Man of the Year' in 2016 by Lokmat and Junior Chamber International and the 'Best Performing Politician' by the Afternoon Voice in 2015. For his efforts to uplift the blind, he was awarded G. L. Nardekar Memorial Award by The National Federation of the Blind in 2008. He is also known to be a powerful orator. Early in his career, he was awarded Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha's 'Best Orator' award in 1998. ==Special legislative efforts== Ever since he first assumed office, Mungantiwar has been involved in many social initiatives and legislative struggles. He played an important role in the getting the Maharashtra government to rename the Nagpur University as 'Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Nagpur University' and Amravati University as 'Sant Gadgebaba Amravati University'. He was also successful in his legislative struggle to get the city of Ballarpur made into an independent tehsil. In 2011, he helped establish the Gondwana University, for Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. ==References== * Sudhir Mungantiwar new Maharashtra BJP chief * Sudhir Mungantiwar inaugurates BJP's renovated office in Pune * Will strive to strengthen party: Sudhir Mungantiwar * We did well in council polls: Sudhir Mungantiwar * Bagwe should resign, says Sudhir Mungantiwar * Official BJP Maharashtra Website * Vidarbha leader Mungantiwar is state BJP chief Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Maharashtra Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:People from Chandrapur district Category:Maharashtra MLAs 2009‚Äì2014 Category:State cabinet ministers of Maharashtra Category:Maharashtra MLAs 2014‚Äì2019 Category:Maharashtra MLAs 1995‚Äì1999 Category:Maharashtra MLAs 1999‚Äì2004 Category:Maharashtra MLAs 2004‚Äì2009 Category:Marathi politicians ","title":"Sudhir Mungantiwar"},{"id":"35343748","text":"Cultural group selection is an explanatory model within cultural evolution of how cultural traits evolve according to the competitive advantage they bestow upon a group. This multidisciplinary approach to the question of human culture engages research from the fields of anthropology, behavioural economics, evolutionary biology, evolutionary game theory, sociology, and psychology. While cultural norms are often beneficial to the individuals who hold them, they need not be.Diamond, Jared. \\"The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race.\\" Discover Magazine. May. 64-66. 1987. Norms can spread by cultural group selection when they are practiced within successful groups, and norms are more likely to spread from groups that are successful. But, for cultural group selection to occur, there must exist, between groups, cultural differences that when transmitted across time affect the persistence or proliferation of the groups.Campbell, D.T. Variation and selective retention in sociocultural evolution. Social change in developing areas: A reinterpretation of evolutionary theory. Cambridge: Schenkman. 1965. 19-49. Cultural norms that provide these advantages will, in turn, lead to the displacement, absorption or even extinction of other, less successful cultural groups.Soltis, J., Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1995. Can group-functional behaviours evolve by cultural group selection? An empirical test. Current Anthropology 36 (3), 473‚Äì494. However, game theoretic models suggest that if individuals are able to migrate between groups (which is common in small-scale societies), differences between groups should be difficult to maintain.Henrich, J. Cultural group selection, coevolutionary processes and large-scale cooperation. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization. Volume 53, Issue 1, January 2004, 3‚Äì35. Research in psychology reveals that humans have a particular set of traits, which include imitation, conformity, and in- group bias, that are capable of supporting the maintenance of these group differences over extended periods of time. Cultural group selection gives a compelling explanation for how large-scale complex societies have formed.Turchin, Peter. 2018. Ultrasociety: How 10,000 Years of War Made Humans the Greatest Cooperators on Earth. Chaplin, CT: Beresta Books, 67-94. While altruistic behaviour such as kin selection and reciprocity can explain the behaviour of small social groups common in many species, it is unable to explain the large complex societies of unrelated, anonymous individuals that we see in the human species. However, one of the major distinctions between humans and other species is our reliance on social learning in acquiring behaviours.Horner, V. Whiten, A. Causal knowledge and imitation/emulation switching in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens). Animal Cognition (2005) 8: 164‚Äì181 These instincts allow for the acquisition and persistence of culture.Tomasello, M. The Human Adaptation for Culture. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28, (1999), pp. 509-529 Through cultural group selection, culturally specific cooperative behaviour can evolve to support large societies. For example, in a study that spanned a variety of cultures, testing behaviour in Ultimatum, Dictator, and Third-party punishment games, it was found that standards of fairness and inclination to punish were correlated with both participation in world religions and market integration.Henrich, J., et al. Markets, Religion, Community Size, and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment. Science 327, 1480 (2010) This indicates how many of the behaviours necessary for complex societies are the result of cultural exposure rather than any evolution of our psychology. == Human adaptations for culture == For cultural knowledge and behaviour to persist across multiple generations, humans need to have the capacity to acquire, retain, and transmit cultural information. While many species engage in social learning, humans consistently rely upon it for behavioural cues and information about the environment. In a study comparing human children and young chimpanzees, it was shown that, when given a demonstration on how to retrieve a reward from a box, chimps copy relevant behaviour, while ignoring irrelevant behaviour, to solve the task. Meanwhile, human children will faithfully imitate both relevant and irrelevant behaviour to solve the same task. While this may seem like a negative quality, it is what allows for reliable, high-fidelity transmission of cultural information, and produces stable behavioural equilibria within cultural groups. Michael Tomasello suggests the following three adaptations are necessary for human culture:  Joint attention  At around 9‚Äì12 months infants begin engaging in joint attention. This involves following the gaze of an adult or using them as social reference points. Put simply, they become aware of the adult's attention and behaviour towards objects in the environment. In this sense, the child is beginning to understand people as goal-oriented intentional agents. This is vitally important for learning through imitation and, eventually, language acquisition.  Imitative learning  By about 1 year of age, children begin to learn by imitation. At this point, children are capable of discriminating intentional actions from unintentional ones, and will attempt to accurately copy those intentional actions to accomplish tasks they've seen adults do. Because of imitative learning, children will copy those intentional acts which have no perceivable effect on the outcome, as well as strange or unnatural actions when easier methods are available. For example, an Andrew Meltzoff study found that 14-month-old children will, after seeing an adult do it, bend at the waist and press a panel with their head to turn on a light, instead of using their hands.Meltzoff A. 1988. Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli. Dev. Psychol. 24:470-76 According to Tomasello, imitative learning is necessary for learning the symbolic conventions of language.  Linguistic symbols and cognitive representation  Through imitatively learning, the child comprehends that linguistic symbols are intended to focus attention to some specific aspect of the shared experience. In doing this, the child must be able to take the perspective of the speaker. Due to the intersubjectivity of linguistic symbols, language allows one to communicate various perspectives and shift attention to one aspect of the world over another. In learning a language, a child is inheriting a vast set of linguistic symbols that have been passed down many generations. What is inherited then is the methods of shifting attention and perspective that were historically of importance to the people of that culture. == Mechanisms that maintain between-group variation == Without between-group variation, cultural group selection could not occur, as there would be no group differentiation to select for. While processes such as cultural drift, epidemics, and natural disasters increase between-group variation, migration and genetic mixing decrease between-group variation and increase within-group variation. Variation is only maintained when cultural groups have mechanisms that prevent the norms of outside groups from invading the cultural group. These ‚Äòmechanisms‚Äô are those uniquely human psychological traits and behaviours that encourage imitation, conformity, and in-group biases. According to Joseph Henrich, between-group variation is maintained by the following four mechanisms:  Conformist transmission  Conformist transmission refers to the psychological bias to preferentially imitate high frequency behaviors in the cultural group. This homogenizes the social group and reinforces widely held cultural norms. This explains why individuals within a social group hold the same beliefs and why these beliefs persist over time. While individuals will rely on copying high frequency behaviors under various conditions, this reliance increases when an individual is exposed to ambiguous environmental or social information.Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1985. Culture and the Evolutionary Process. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.Ellison, G., Fudenberg, D., 1993. Rules of thumb for social learning. Journal of Political Economy 101 (4), 612‚Äì643.Baron, R., Vandello, J., Brunsman, B., 1996. The forgotten variable in conformity research: impact of task importance on social influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (5), 915‚Äì927. Conformist transmission can maintain between-group variation by reducing within-group variation, but it also facilitates the rapid spread of novel ideas, which increases between-group variation. Taken together, reduced within-group variation and increased between-group variation lead to the cultural divergence between groups that is the driving force of cultural group selection.  Prestige-biased and self-similarity transmission  Prestige-biased transmission is the tendency the copy those members of the group that are more successful. Preferentially copying successful members of the group allows individuals to avoid costly trial-and-error learning by imitating the better-than-average skills of the more prestigious cultural models. Individual can determine the rank of potential models by how much deference they are shown by the rest of the group. Deference is shown to high- prestige individuals to gain the opportunity to copy their successful models. We can see evidence for this bias in how new technologies, or economic practices spread to different groups according to how quick \\"opinion leaders\\" adopt them.Rogers, E.M., 1995. Diffusion of Innovations. Free Press, New York. Meanwhile, self-similarity transmission is the tendency to copy those individuals who are similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige individuals who are similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige individuals who are similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible with his or her knowledge or social environment.Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1987. The evolution of ethnic markers. Cultural Anthropology 2 (1), 27‚Äì38. These two social biases act together in reducing within-group variation. Additionally, prestige-biased transmission increases between-group variation by contributing to the spread of novel ideas.  Punishment of non-conformists  Non-conformists threaten to increase within-group variation by introducing deviant behaviours to the group and must receive costly punishment to maintain a homogenous social group. As a consequence of being punished, non-conformists will be less successful than other members of the group. Prestige-biased transmission would suggest that non-conformist behaviors would, therefore, not spread through the population. Papers on the topic suggest that this kind of punishment is prevalent across many different societies.Sober, E., Wilson, D.S., 1998. Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Harvard University Press, Cambridge.Roth, A.E., Prasnikar, V., Okuno-Fujiwara, M., Zamir, S., 1991. Bargaining and market behavior in Jerusalem, Ljubljana, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study. American Economic Review 81 (5), 1068‚Äì1095.Henrich, J., Boyd, R., Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Camerer, C., Fehr, E., McElreath, R., 2001. In search of Homo economicus: experiments in 15 small-scale societies. American Economic Review 91, 73‚Äì78.Fehr, E., G√§chter, S., 2002. Altruistic punishment in humans. Nature 415, 137‚Äì140.  Normative conformity  Normative conformity is the act of changing one‚Äôs visible behaviour, simply to appear to match the majority, and without actually internalizing the groups opinions. This differs from conformist transmission since normative conformity does not consider frequency of a behaviour as an indicator of worth. The Asch conformity experiments are a perfect example of how robust this effect isAsch, S.E., 1951. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In: Guetzkow, H. (Ed.), Groups, Leadership and Men. Carnegie, Pittsburgh, pp. 177‚Äì190. and its replication across many cultures shows that this behaviour is very common.Furnham, A., 1984. Studies of cross-cultural conformity: a brief and critical review. Psychologia: An International Journal of Psychology in the Orient 27 (1), 65‚Äì72.Neto, F., 1995. Conformity and independence revisited. Social Behavior and Personality 23 (3), 217‚Äì222. Henrich suggests that normative conformity may have evolved to respond to the spread of punishing behaviour toward non-conformists. By appearing similar to the group, one can gain the advantages of in-group membership, while also avoiding punishment. A curious byproduct of normative conformity is that it can contribute to the conformity transmission of norms that the transmitter does not hold, because they were mistakenly attributed by the imitator. == Mechanisms == As Donald T. Campbell says, for cultural group selection to occur, there must be cultural differences between groups which affect their persistence or proliferation. This means groups are selected for or against according to their respective gains or losses relative to other groups. Joseph Henrich describes the three mechanisms through which this process occurs:  Demographic swamping  Demographic swamping occurs when one or more cultural groups reproduces individuals faster than other groups in the region because of stable, culturally transmitted ideas or practices. This is the slowest kind of cultural groups selection as it depends on natural selection of between-group cultural variation operating on a scale of millennia. It has been suggested that this is how early agriculturalist displaced hunter-gatherer societies.Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P., Piazza, A., 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.Young and Bettinger, 1992Young, D., Bettinger, R.L., 1992. The numic spread: a computer simulation. American Antiquity 57 (1), 85‚Äì99.Diamond, J.M., 1997. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. W.W. Norton & Company, New York. Direct intergroup competition  Direct intergroup competition is the process by which cultural groups compete with each other over resources by engaging in warfare and raiding. The cultural practices and behaviour that gives an advantage to one group over another will proliferate at the expense of those who cannot compete.Turchin, Peter. 2007. War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires. New York: Penguin Group, 1-11. There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group's success, such as technological development, social and political organization, economic development, nationalism, etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500‚Äì1000 years for group selection to happen this way.  Prestige-biased group selection  In prestige-biased group selection, when individuals have opportunities to copy people from nearby groups, they will preferentially imitate the members of groups that are more cooperative than their own. Since cooperative groups have a higher average payoff than non-cooperative groups, members of cooperative groups will be considered more prestigious and worthy of imitation. == How the Theory of Cultural Group Selection Can Be Tested == Cultural group selection theory can provide insight into human cooperation and is therefore a useful framework for generating hypothesis related to cultural evolution. These theories, however, must be tested using empirical data: a task addressed by several large-scale projects in the field of quantitative history. For instance, the Seshat: Global History Databank uses real-world historical, archaeological and anthropological data to test hypotheses from cultural group selection theory and other competing explanations. The Collaborative for Information and Analysis; the International Institute of Social History; and the Database of Religious History also provide datasets and analytical tools for assessing the validity of competing hypotheses about human cultural evolution.International Institute of Social History. 2016.

He is best known for the book Kees de Jongen. ==Biography== Theo Thijssen, the oldest child out of six, grew up in the Amsterdam suburb of Jordaan where his father had a small shoe-shop. His family was not wealthy, and after his father died when he was eight they moved and his mother started a grocery where he and his younger brother had to help to get some income for the family. After a tough entrance exam with a scholarship he was allowed on the Rijkskweekschool voor onderwijzers, a college to become a teacher, in Haarlem. After his study was completed he became teacher from 1898 until 1921 at several schools in Amsterdam. In 1905 he and college friend Peter Bol founded the magazine De Nieuwe School in which he wrote a lot of articles with criticism about teaching methods, learning books, read books and child books. He also wrote some fragments about a fantasy rich boy Kees, that would later become his most famous novel Kees de Jongen. In this book he enriched the Dutch language with the word \\"zwembadpas\\", a quick way of walking that Kees had developed. This word became so legendary that the Theo Thijssen Museum organized the day of the \\"zwembadpas\\". In 1906 he married Johanna Maria Zeegerman, craft teacher, with whom he had one son. After her death in 1908 he remarried in 1909 with Geertje Dade, with whom he had a daughter and two sons. In 1921 Thijssen became salaried director of the Dutch Association of Teachers. He also became editor from \\"De Bode\\" (a magazine about the working conditions of teachers) and \\"School en huis\\" (a magazine about education). In the magazine about education he wrote again about Kees and made it a more ongoing story. This would later become the well-known novel Kees de jongen. Although Thijssen always said the story was fiction there are various similarities with his own childhood. Just like his father Thijssen harboured socialistic sympathies from an early age, although he only became member of the Sociaal Democratische Arbeiders Partij (SDAP), a social party in the Netherlands, in 1912. From 1933 until 1940 he also was member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands for this party and from 1935 until 1941 member of the Amsterdam city council, also for the SDAP. In December 1943 he had a series of serious diseases and eventually died from the effects of a stroke. == Legacy == The literary award Theo Thijssen-prijs is named after him. ==Bibliography== *Barend Wels (1908) *Jongensdagen (1909) *Taal en schoolmeester (1911) *Sommenboek voor de volksschool (1912) *Cijfers (1913) *Cijferboek voor de volksschool (1913) *Kees de jongen (1923) *Schoolland (1925) *De gelukkige klas (1926) *Het grijze kind (1927) *De examenidioot of De kinderexamens van 1928 (1929) *Egeltje.

The controlled drug legislation in these jurisdictions requires drug scheduling decisions to follow an evidence-based process, where the harms of the drug are assessed and reviewed so that an appropriate legal status can be assigned. Since many designer drugs sold in recent years have had little or no published research that could help inform such a decision, they have been widely sold as \\"legal highs\\", often for months, before sufficient evidence accumulates to justify placing them on the controlled drug schedules. This situation has been deemed to be undesirable, as every time a designer drug has been banned, novel compounds with similar effects have been quickly developed and brought to market, often with worse health consequences reported than the original compound. The temporary class drug status has been developed to circumvent the evidential requirements and allow drugs to be banned temporarily as soon as they are deemed by authorities to be causing harm to individuals or society. The temporary ban lasts for a period of 1 year, after which the drug would in theory be made legal again, if sufficient evidence to ban it permanently had not been forthcoming. During the period of the temporary ban, the temporary class drugs are treated equivalently to established illegal drugs, though with reduced or absent penalties for personal use amounts, and the main focus of enforcement being on importation and sale of the drugs. ==United Kingdom== Initially, only the dissociative arylcyclohexylamine derivative methoxetamine was banned as a temporary class drug in the UK, effective from 5 April 2012. On 26 February 2013 methoxetamine was banned as a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act along with a large number of other arylcyclohexylamine derivatives under a 'catch-all' chemical structure clause. \\"In an attempt to prevent legal high manufacturers looking for a new ketamine analogue to sell, the government has placed countless other ketamine analogues into Class B and Schedule 1.\\"http://drugscience.org.uk/blog/2013/01/23/throwing-out-baby-bathwater/ On 10 June 2013, a total of 10 benzofuran and indole analogues and four NBOMe hallucinogens were classified as Temporary Class Drugs in the UK following an ACMD recommendation. Specifically these include 5-APB, 6-APB, 5-APDB, 6-APDB and their N-methyl derivatives 5-MAPB, 6-MAPB, 5-MAPDB and 6-MAPDB, as well as 5-IT and its isomer 6-IT, plus NBOMe-2C-C, NBOMe-2C-B, NBOMe-2C-I and NBOMe-2C-D. This means that sale and import of the named substances are criminal offences and are treated as for Class B drugs. On 31 March 2015, five derivatives of methylphenidate were recommended to be banned in the UK as Temporary Class Drugs following their sale as uncontrolled stimulant drugs. The compounds listed for control were ethylphenidate, propylphenidate, isopropylphenidate, methylnaphthidate and 3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate. On 25 June 2015, two more derivatives of methylphenidate, 4-Methylmethylphenidate and ethylnaphthidate, were recommended to be banned in the UK as Temporary Class Drugs following their sale as uncontrolled stimulant drugs. Following the ban on ethylphenidate authorities noticed that methiopropamine had replaced it as the stimulant of choice for injecting users. A TCDO was announced a week later and it was banned 48 hours after this. ==New Zealand== In New Zealand, 35 drugs have been banned as temporary class drugs since August 2011, 24 of which have subsequently had the temporary ban renewed for a further year after reaching the end of the initial one-year ban period. These include; JWH-018, JWH-022, JWH-073, JWH-081, JWH-122, JWH-201, JWH-203, JWH-210, JWH-250, JWH-302, AM-694, AM-2201, RCS-4, RCS-4 butyl homologue, 2-methoxy isomer of RCS-4, and 2-methoxy isomer of RCS-4 butyl homologue, which were banned on 16 August 2011, JWH-019, JWH-200 and AM-1220, which were banned on 14 October 2011, AM-2233, banned on 29 December 2011, AM-1248, AM-2232 and UR-144, banned on 6 April 2012, and the stimulant methylhexanamine, banned on 9 April 2012. Another four cannabinoid compounds, namely CB-13, MAM-2201, AKB48 and XLR-11, were banned on 13 July 2012. A further cannabinoid compound NNE1 was banned from 8 November 2012. Two more cannabinoids APICA (also known as 2NE1) and its 5-fluoropentyl derivative STS-135 were banned from 22 November 2012.New Zealand Government Gazette, Notice Number 7444, 15 November 2012 Another cannabinoid EAM-2201 was banned from 6 December 2012. Another stimulant, the phenyltropane derivative RTI-126, was banned from 27 December 2012. Two more cannabinoids QUCHIC (also known as BB-22) and 5F-AKB48 were banned from 9 May 2013. On 18 July 2013, the Psychoactive Substances Act 2013 came into effect in New Zealand. This superseded the Temporary Class Drug scheme, as all novel psychoactive substances are restricted by default, except where specifically licensed. This Act promises to introduce strict toxicity testing and quality control standards for recreational psychoactive substances, with products that are proved to meet the safety criteria being allowed to be sold legally. Products that were on sale immediately prior to the introduction of the Act were allowed to continue to be on sale while the safety testing regime is implemented, but can be removed from sale if significant adverse events are reported. A number of interim licenses have been refused or revoked under this process, and by January 2014 a total of twelve more synthetic cannabis products had been removed from sale, containing ingredients such as ADB-CHMICA (SGT-7), 5F-PB-22, SGT-55 (CUMYL-BICA), SGT-56 (CUMYL-PICA), 4-F-AM-2201, 4-Cl-AM-2201 and PB-22. On 27 April 2014 it was announced that all 41 remaining untested \\"legal high\\" products, which had been allowed to continue to be on sale during an interim period, were to be banned on 9 May 2014. These were mainly synthetic cannabis products containing ingredients such as AB- FUBINACA, PB-22 (QUPIC), 5F-PB-22, SGT-24 (CUMYL-PINACA), CP 55,244, 4-F-AM-2201, 4-Cl-AM-2201, 5F-ADBICA and AB-005. There was also one cannabinoid pill containing SGT-42 (CUMYL-THPINACA), and several \\"party pill\\" products containing mixtures of ingredients such as caffeine, hordenine, synephrine and kava. No \\"legal high\\" products will be allowed back on sale in New Zealand under the Psychoactive Substances Act until they have been tested in a manner yet to be determined, and found to present a \\"low risk of harm\\". This process is expected to take at least 18 months or more.Rychert M, Wilkins C.

The sisters attended weekly shows where the performers were sketched live at both circus and variety theaters. Their records constitute a unique documentation of European circus in the first half of the twentieth century. Their extensive journal entries from 1904 to 1947 added fascinating information and insights, written in a vigorous style and teeming with gossip about the circus community, with a marvellous eye for detail.http://www.culture.fr/fr/sections/collections/moteur_collections/cirque In the French circus world the pair were known as \\"les demoiselles Vesque\\" or \\"les s≈ìurs Vesque\\". Marthe and Juliette Vesque were inseparable throughout their lives, remained spinsters, and shared occupations and interests. Their father, Julien Joseph Vesque (1848-1895), was a noted botanist. He acted as Ma√Ætre de Conf√©rence at the Institut Agronomique in Paris and had numerous publications to his name. As did botanists of the period, Julien Vesque created detailed drawings of his botanical work. These artistic skills he taught to his daughters, training them to produce accurate renditions through keen observation. The sisters' love for the circus started at an early age, and as Paris was a circus hotspot in the early 1900s the sisters were provided with ample opportunity to indulge their passion. Performing at that time were the Cirque d‚ÄôHiver and Cirque Medrano, as well as the Nouveau Cirque, the Cirque M√©tropole (later Cirque de Paris), the Hippodrome de la Place Clichy and the Empire Music-Hall Cirque. Marthe and Juliette were drawn together by the premature death of their father in 1895, when they were only sixteen and fourteen years old. Both became professional artists, and for 24 years hand- painted floral decorations on china at the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres, the leading French manufacturer. They left when its style became too modern for their taste and found work at the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle, depicting natural history specimens, especially those that were entomological. Their illustrations were also used in botany books, a number of their plates being included in Larousse Encyclopedia. Their work was often signed jointly as 'M.J.V.' or 'M.J. Vesque' as seen in their illustrations for \\"Flore de Madagascar et des Comores\\". left In their spare time they were to be found at the circus or music-hall, busily recording the acts, engaging the circus staff in conversation, and adding impressions to their journal. They steadfastly refused to sell their paintings, but presented some to favoured friends, such as journalists and circus historians, who were equally addicted to the world of circus. Before her death in 1949, Marthe Vesque elicited a promise from her sister to never dispose of their work. However, a few years before her own death, Juliette started donating it piecemeal to the Mus√©e national des Arts et Traditions Populaires, founded by the circus enthusiast, Georges-Henri Rivi√®re. Juliette ceased her circus sketches after Marthe's death, but contributed articles to the circus magazine, Le Cirque dans l‚ÄôUnivers. By then she was widely regarded as an authority on the circus world. After Juliette's death the remainder of the collection of some 8 000 drawings, including the sisters' journal, found their way to the Mus√©e national des Arts et Traditions Populaires by 1968.Circopedia ==External links== *Europeana *Journal of the Vesque Sisters *MuCEM *Gallery ==Bibliography== * Le Cirque en Images - Edith Mauriange and Paul Bouissac/Marthe and Juliette Vesque, (G.P.

His younger brother Louis was bishop of Osnabr√ºck. After his father died in 1249, there were some problems with his succession. Since he and his brothers were still minors, Lord Bernard III of Lippe took up the regency for Otto III and his brothers Louis and John. Their mother, Adelaide, fled with her children to her relatives in Ratzeburg, whereupon Bernard forcibly occupied Ravensberg Castle. Eventually, Otto III was installed as Count of Ravensberg. In 1264, Otto III was victorious in a feud against the Count of Gesmold. In 1267, he fought on the side of Archbishop Engelbert II of Cologne in the Battle of Z√ºlpich. After Count Henry IV of Oldenburg-Wildeshausen died in 1270, Vlotho Castle came into the joint possession of Otto III and his cousin Henry of Berg. In 1290, Henry's successor Gerhard sold his share to Archbishop Siegfried II of Cologne. On 5 March 1271, Otto III married Hedwig of Lippe. In 1277, Otto III concluded a secret alliance with Bishop Conrad III of Osnabr√ºck, Bishop Everhard of M√ºnster and Herford Abbey against the Lords of Lippe. On 12 July 1293, Otto III and his wife Hedwig found an abbey at Bielefeld. It was required that the abbey house at least twelve canons. The existing Church of St. Mary was used as the abbey church. The Count of Ravensberg would hold the right of patronage. Otto III died in 1306. He and his wife were buried in the abbey they had founded in Bielefeld. Otto's son Otto IV succeeded him as Count of Ravensberg. == Marriage and children == On 5 March 1271, Otto III married Hedwig of Lippe ( - 5 March 1315), the daughter of Bernard III of Lippe. They had nine children: * Uda (between 1268 and 1276 - 25 June 1313), married John I of Isenburg-Limburg; * Hedwig (d. after 1346), married as his second wife to Torgils Knutsson (d. 9 February 1306); * Herman (died near Milan) * Louis (d. after 1294) * Otto IV, Count of Ravensberg, (before 1276 - between 20 February and 6 March 1329), married to Margaret of Berg ( - after 1339) * Bernard (d. 10 August 1346) * Sophie (before 1276 - after 1328); married Count Hildebald I of Oldenburg-Altbruchhausen (before 1270 - after 1310) * Adelaide ( - between 1335 and 1339); married in 1297 Landgrave Otto I of Hesse ( - 17 January 1328 in Kassel) * Jutta (d. before 10 August 1305); married before 28 November 1282, to Count Dietrich II of Honstein-Klettenberg (d. between 10 August and 13 December 1305) == External links == * Otto III, Count of Ravensberg at Panzerreiter.de, viewed on 26 January 2009 * History of the County of Ravensberg at http://www.andreas-janda.de, viewed on 26 January 2009 * Otto II (III) of Ravensberg at Nobility database the University of Erlangen, viewed on 21 March 2010 Category:Counts of Ravensberg Category:13th-century births Category:1306 deaths Category:13th-century German people ","title":"Otto III of Ravensberg"},{"id":"35344622","text":"The 1989‚Äì90 Scottish League Cup was the forty-fourth season of Scotland's second football knockout competition.

Spit of Petrushino on a 19th-century postcard Petrushino is a thin sand spit on the Gulf of Taganrog, Azov Sea on the Southwestern outskirts of Taganrog. The Gully of Petrushino is a quarry situated near Beriev Aircraft Company, which was formed in the early 20th century after extractions of clay for a no longer existing brickworks. ==Massacres== The SS Einsatzgruppe Sonderkommando 10a performed systematic genocide of Taganrog citizens from the first days of occupation. The large groups of citizens (old men, women, communists, young communists, gypsies, Jews, and anyone suspected in aiding the Taganrog resistance movement) were taken from Vladimirskaya Plaza in Taganrog to Petrushino village (near Beriev) and shot in the Gully of Petrushino (Todesschlucht). The massacres in Taganrog started with the Final Solution of the Jewish question. On October 22, 1941 the Ortskommandant issued an order for all Jewish people to wear a Star of David sign and to register at the Ortskommandantur. It was followed by Appeal to the Jewish Population of Taganrog signed by the Ortskommandant Alberti. The \\"appeal\\" was calling all Jews to assemble on October 29, 1941 at 8:00AM on Vladimirskaya Plaza in Taganrog from where they were supposed to be taken to a ghetto. Alberti explained this measure as necessary due to alleged rise of antisemitism among local population, and that the German police and Gestapo would better manage the question if the Jewish population were separated into a certain district of the city: > In order to implement this measure, the Jews of both sexes and of all ages, > including the persons born of marriages between Jews and not-Jews must be > present on Wednesday, October 29, 1941 at 8 o'clock in the morning at > Vladimirskaya Ploshad of Taganrog.

Research, articles to follow, have indicated that expectancy of outcomes has a large bearing on behavior patterns. In layman's terms, If a person believes negative outcomes will result, they are less likely to engage in the behavior yielding said outcomes. If positive outcomes are expected, a person is more likely to engage in the behavior yielding such outcomes.

Email hacking is the unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, an email account or email correspondence. ==Overview== Email is now a very widely used communication method. If an email account is hacked it can allow the attacker access to the personal, sensitive, or confidential information in the mail storage; as well as allowing them to read new incoming and outgoing email - and to send and receive as the legitimate owner. On some email platforms it may also allow them to setup automated email processing rules. All of these could be very harmful for the legitimate user. ==Attacks== There are a number of ways in which a hacker can illegally gain access to an email account. Virus A virus or other malware can be sent via email, and if executed may be able to capture the user's password and send it to an attacker. Phishing Phishing involves emails that appear to be from legitimate sender but are scams which ask for verification of personal information, such as an account number, a password, or a date of birth. If unsuspecting victims respond, the result may be stolen accounts, financial loss, or identity theft. ==Prevention measures== Email on the internet is sent by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). While mail can be encrypted between mail servers, this is not typically enforced, but instead Opportunistic TLS is used - where mailservers negotiate for each email connection whether it will be encrypted, and to what standard. Where a mail flow between servers is not encrypted, it could be intercepted by an ISP or government agency and the contents can be read by passive monitoring. For higher security, email administrators can configure servers to require encryption to specified servers or domains. Email spoofing and similar issues which facilitate phishing are addressed by the 'stack' of Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). Setting all these in place is technically challenging, and not visible to the end user, so implementation progress has been slow. A further layer, Authenticated Received Chain (ARC), allows mail flow through intermediate mail servers such as mailing lists or forwarding services to be better handled - a common objection to implementation. Businesses typically have advanced firewalls, anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to prevent or detect improper network access. They may also have security specialists perform an audit on the company and hire a Certified Ethical Hacker to perform a simulated attack or \\"pen test\\" in order to find any gaps in security. Although companies may secure its internal networks, vulnerabilities can also occur through home networking. Email may be protected by methods, such as, creating a strong password, encrypting its contents,https://prism-break.org/en/all/#email-encryption or using a digital signature. If passwords are leaked or otherwise become known to an attacker, having two-factor authentication enabled may prevent improper access. There are also specialist encrypted email services such as Protonmail or Mailfence. ==Cases of email hacking== Notable cases of email hacks include: * Email archives from the Climatic Research Unit were leaked to create the scandal popularly known as Climategate. * News of the World journalists hacked email accounts for their stories. * UK politician Rowenna Davis had her mail account taken over and held ransom. * US politician Sarah Palin has been hacked in order to find embarrassing or incriminating correspondence. * As part of the Sony Pictures hack, over 170,000 pieces of email between top executives ended up on Wikileaks. * Former United States president, George H.W. Bush had his email hacked. * The personal email of political consultant John Podesta was hacked, and contents later published by WikiLeaks. ==References== ","title":"Email hacking"},{"id":"35345008","text":"Prorophora curvibasella is a species of snout moth.

It is commercially available as part of Griess reagents, which find application in quantitative inorganic analysis of nitrates, nitrite and sulfonamide in blood, using the Griess test. ==Preparation== This compound can be prepared by the reaction of 1-naphthylamine with 2-chloroethanamine. It is commercially available as the dihydrochloride salt. ==Properties== N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine undergoes most reactions typical to naphthylamine and primary amines such as diazotation. Similar to its analog ethylenediamine, it can also act as a bidentate ligand to give several coordination compounds. However, it is a weaker bidentate ligand as the nitrogen atom in the naphthylamine group is weakly coordinating due to the dispersal of charge by resonance. For example, it reacts with potassium tetrachloroplatinate in aqueous solution to give (N-1-naphthyl-ethylenediamine)-dichloroplatinum(II). ==Uses== N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride is widely used in the quantitative analysis of nitrate and nitrite in water samples by colorimetry. It readily undergoes a diazonium coupling reaction in the presence of nitrite to give a strongly colored azo compound. Sample containing nitrite ions is first neutralized and then treated with dilute hydrochloric acid at 0 - 5 ¬∞C to give nitrous acid. Then an excess but fixed volume of sulfanilamide and N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride solution is added. With nitrous acid as the limiting reagent, the azo coupling reaction produces an azo dye quantitatively with respect to the nitrite ions: 800px The diazo compound formed accounts for the red coloration typical for a positive result. The color intensity of the resulting solution is then measured by a colorimeter and checked against a calibration curve to determine the nitrite ion concentration. To analyze nitrate concentrations quantitatively, the sample is first passed through a copper-cadmium column to reduce the nitrate ions quantitatively to nitrite ions, and the above procedure can be employed. However, the result should be adjusted for the nitrite ions present in the original sample., Nitrate analysis protocol and principles. This method can be applied in many aspects, including determining the nitrate/nitrite concentrations in sewage or other biological samples such as intracellular fluids, given that the sample is clear and colorless. In a similar protocol, the levels of sulfonamide in blood can be detected similarly with the same principles. ==References== Category:Naphthylamines ","title":"N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine"},{"id":"35345019","text":"Prorophora dialeuca is a species of snout moth described by George Hampson in 1912.

They play a style of music they describe as \\"Northern Funk\\" - a contemporary fusion of funk, soul, northern soul, hip-hop and electronica. The band is composed of Jonathan Scott Watson (known as Smoove) and singer / songwriter John Turrell. The studio and touring band also includes founder member Mike Porter (Keyboards), Lloyd Wright (Guitar), Neil Harland (Bass) and Oscar Cassidy (Drums). Previous members include Athol Cassidy (Guitar), Andy Champion (Bass), Lloyd Croft (Drums), Dave Wilde (Sax), Tim McVicar (Bass) and Fez (Dancer). They have released five studio albums: Antique Soul (Jalapeno Records, 2009), Eccentric Audio (Jalapeno Records, 2011), Broken Toys (Jalapeno Records, 2014), Crown Posada (Jalapeno Records, 2016) and Mount Pleasant (Jalapeno Records, 2018). ==History== The story of Smoove & Turrell began in the post millennium North East of England with a group of working class lads and a shared passion for soul. Smoove had met keyboardist Mike Porter through the local music scene in Newcastle and recruited him for his ‚ÄòSmoove Live‚Äô project for the label Acid Jazz. Around Mike‚Äôs house one day they overheard a neighbour singing sublime melodies in his garage with friends which turned out to be none other than a young John Turrell practising in a band called ‚ÄòThe Stevies‚Äô. After a couple of further sessions ‚Äòscouting‚Äô him they finally knocked on the door and had a chat and hit it off straight away. A man of many facets, John Turrell was a skilled carpenter, working and teaching the trade to apprentices at a local college as well as his musical endeavours. After the trio performed several gigs together with various other guest musicians it was agreed they would create some new material and so they started to write and arrange a clutch of tracks that Smoove would record and produce. 'I Can't Give You Up' 7\\" single, Club Tikka (2007) The first Smoove & Turrell release was a limited edition 7\\" single called \\"I Can't Give You Up\\", issued in 2007 on German record label Club Tikka as a double A-side shared with \\"Curry Rice (Instrumental)\\" by Torpedo Boyz. It was recorded at Mike Porter‚Äôs house as his Hammond Organ, which features prominently on the track, was immovably wedged in his utility room! It gained underground popularity, particularly on Mod and Northern Soul forums and all 500 pressings of the record sold out. The resultant lack of supply started a notable bidding war for one copies on auction site eBay - one of which sold for ¬£166. Upon completing the recording of their first album, the band's Live agent sent a copy to Jalapeno Records, who offered the band a deal within an hour of listening to it. Ahead of the release of the debut album Antique Soul (2009), Jalape√±o reissued the single \\"I Can't Give You Up\\". \\"You Don't Know\\" and \\"Beggarman\\" completed a trio of singles, taken from the album, that collectively earned two 'Record Of The Week' accolades on BBC Radio 2 and were playlisted on BBC Radio 6 Music. The band toured extensively to support the album, including an appearance at the Big Chill Festival. It was in fellow soul head DJ Craig Charles that they found their first radio champion as he supported them heavily on ‚ÄòThe Craig Charles Funk & Soul Show‚Äô which was a kick-starter for their assault on national radio eventually landing Radio 2 record of the week twice and a playlist on BBC 6 Music. In 2011, the band released its second album Eccentric Audio (also on Jalapeno Records). The first single to be taken from the album \\"Slow Down\\" reached number 1 in the iTunes Soul chart and was playlisted across national radio stations in the UK and Europe. The follow up single \\"Hard Work\\" was also playlisted on BBC Radio 2 and played by Chris Evans and Graham Norton. The track also appeared on a TV commercial for Rust-Oleum. \\"Gabriel\\" was the final single to be taken from the album. Smoove & Turrell tracks were used on US TV shows, feature films and an ABC network primetime advertising campaign, as well as in video games such as 'The Crew'. KCRW in LA put 'Hard Work' in their coveted Today‚Äôs Top Tune slot further exposing the band to west coast tastemakers and the boys becoming unlikely darlings of the US sync business. The band capped off 2011 with live appearances on BBC Radio 2 on Christmas Eve and BBC Radio 6 Music on New Year's Eve. 2012 was spent touring and writing. They supported Nile Rodgers and Chic, and Martha and the Vandellas over the Summer festival season and put in an appearance at Space in Ibiza. In 2014 the band released its third album on Jalape√±o, entitled Broken Toys. Its release was preceded by the release of the single \\"Lay It On Me\\" and followed by \\"Will You Be Mine\\" and \\"Now or Never\\". The band formally launched the album at a gig at The Jazz Cafe in London. Following the album launch, the band embarked on a UK and European promotional tour - The Broken Toys tour - to support its release. Respected DJ / label boss and producer Gilles Peterson played the title track on his BBC 6 Music show. One notable show on 13 March 2015 saw the band play a secret acoustic gig at the North East Of England Institute Of Mining. The secret was the location of the gig, which was only revealed two days prior to the performance, in front of an audience of 100 fans. The band continued to tour in 2015. By 2016 their extensive touring and appeal across borders was recognised by the BPI and the band were awarded Music for Export Growth Scheme funding to assist with an extended touring schedule. The band were invited to play Canadian Music Week and crowdfunded the necessary costs to take them there in just two days. Album number four 'Crown Posada' was released in 2016, with the whole band involved in the writing process. An album which infused their northern soul and funk style with early electronica influences, rock, pop, disco and jazz whilst still maintaining the signature Smoove & Turrell sound. Socially conscious lyrics are very much a centre piece of the themes explored by the band. Highlighting the divide between the rich and the poor and offering an insider‚Äôs look at what it‚Äôs like to grow up, live and raise a family in the North East of England. '50 days Of Winter' in particular offers a bleak picture of the isolation that can strike when life on the road stops and real life kicks in. As always though with Smoove & Turrell the highs and the lows of life are represented and the hard times realism of some of the lyrics is tempered by the irrepressible dancefloor euphoria of others. The album opener 'You Could Have Been A Lady' ‚Äì a cover of the Hot Chocolate classic ‚Äì being a prime example. The track was playlisted on BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music and championed by DJ Chris Evans. 'Mount Pleasant' LP cover, Jalape√±o Records (2018) Never ones to rest for long, the Geordie soul crew returned in 2018 with a stunning fifth album 'Mount Pleasant', after the success of Crown Posada , which gave the band multiple BBC Radio 2 playlists and 6 music spins. An album which, true to the band's style, draws on subject matters which are aimed to make us stop and think, with songs such as the politically charged ‚ÄòHate Seeking Missile‚Äô , balanced fittingly with uplifting stompers, such as ‚ÄòThere For Me‚Äô. The lead single 'You're Gone', a duet featuring John Turrell and Jalape√±o Records stablemate, Izo Fitzroy, was again picked up by Gilles Peterson and played extensively by Craig Charles on BBC Radio 2. The follow up single 'I Feel Alive' was released in June 2016. The euphoric track, which recalls a hedonistic night John Turrell spent in Paris, is backed with the On the B side is ‚ÄòMr Hyde‚Äô - a beast of a track that opens with energetic live drums and a standout organ riff, played by Mike Porter on his vintage Farfisa. In May 2018 the band embarked on the 'Mount Pleasant Tour' to support the album, playing at venues throughout the UK and Europe. Since April 2020, the duo present The Northen Coal Experience on Brighton based community radio station 1BTN. ==Band members== Smoove Smoove (Jonathan Scott Watson) originally started out as a professional DJ in 1990, when he worked in bars and clubs, mainly in the Newcastle upon Tyne and Sunderland areas. In 1991 he began to make his own music - based on a blend of hip-hop, soul and funk - and released a single under the band name Ashbrooke All Stars entitled \\"Dubbin' Up The Pieces\\", on East West Records (a Warner Brothers imprint). The track, which was based on the Average White Band classic \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\" reached number 16 on the UK Dance Chart. In the years leading up to the formation of Smoove & Turrell his DJ career flourished, he presented a radio show - called Ultravibe - on Sunderland's Wear FM, fronted a Newcastle upon Tyne funk and hip hop band named Rubberneck and remixed music for other artists. A notable early remix of 'No Nose Job' by hip-hop band Digital Underground was commissioned by the Big Life record label. Smoove's debut single \\"He Won't Get Far\\" was released on the Atomic Hi-Fi label as 12\\" picture disc, designed to resemble dusty, scratched vinyl. In 2004 he signed a deal with Acid Jazz records, releasing two albums Dead Men's Shirts (2005) and Gravy (2007). Outside of Smoove & Turrell he runs two record labels - Wack Records and Wass Records - and works as a music producer, remixer and DJ. His Wack label releases vinyl and digital EPs featuring mashups created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs. Smoove appears as his alter-ego S.M.O.V. on releases issued on the Wack label. The Wass Records label provides a platform for original music based around jazz, hip-hop and funk - but with a contemporary flavour. The label has released singles and albums by Renegades Of Jazz and Daytoner in both vinyl and digital formats. In 2012, Smoove released First Class (on Jalapeno Records), his second compilation album of remixes he has produced for other artists (Gravy being the first). John Turrell John Turrell is a vocalist and songwriter. He is also a skilled carpenter and a former lecturer at Newcastle College. He was lead vocalist of a band called The Stevies, prior to meeting Jonathan Watson and forming Smoove and Turrell. In 2010 listeners of The Craig Charles Funk & Soul Show on BBC Radio 6 Music voted for their Fantasy Funk Band and he was voted best funk male vocalist. Craig Charles subsequently got this funk dream team together to perform at the BBC's Maida Vale studios] for a radio broadcast. Since the formation of Smoove & Turrell, he has collaborated with a number of artists on their own recordings, among these are The James Taylor Quartet, Kraak & Smaak, Ashley Beedle's, Mavis Project, and Fab Samperi. He released his debut solo album, The Kingmaker, in 2013 on the Big Chill label. The album was reissued by Jalape√±o Records and two digital-only EPs, 'The Kingmaker Remixed - parts 1 & 2' were released to support it. ==Live Band== right Smoove & Turrell have performed live throughout the world since 2009. They appear either as a duo (with John Turrell on live vocals and Smoove on decks and samples) or as a full live band. Keyboardist Mike Porter, as well as being one of the band's founders, is also its longest serving touring member. The band has played many festivals including Glastonbury in 2010. They have recorded many live radio sessions on UK and European stations including BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 6 Music and BBC Radio Newcastle. ==Discography== Singles and EPs *\\"I Can't Give You Up\\" (2007) (AA side 7\\" single shared with Torpedo Boyz) - issued as 'Club Tikka 45 Vol. 1' (Muto Records, MUTO008, Germany) - limited edition of 500 pressings. *\\"I Can't Give You Up\\" (2009) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 72, 12\\" single and download) *\\"You Don't Know\\" (2009) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 78, 12\\" single and download) *\\"Don't Go\\" (2009) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 79, limited edition 7\\" single) *\\"Beggarman\\" (2009) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 85, 12\\" single and download) *\\"Slow Down\\" / \\"Broke\\" (2011) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 116, download) *\\"Hard Work\\" / \\"Money\\" (2011) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 121, download) *\\"Hard Work\\" / \\"Slow Down\\" (2011) (Wass Records, WASS-004, limited edition (400 copies) 7\\" white label promo with hand-stamped 'Barnum and cockerel' logo) *\\"Gabriel\\" (2011) (Jalapeno Records, JAL 125, download) *\\"In Deep\\" (2012) Jalapeno Records, JAL 122, 12\\" single and download) *\\"Lay It On Me\\" (2014) Jalape√±o Records * \\"Will You Be Mine EP\\" (2014) Jalape√±o Records * \\"Now Or Never\\" (2014) Jalape√±o Records * \\"You Could Have Been A Lady\\" (2016) Jalape√±o Records * \\"No Point In Trying\\" (2016) Jalape√±o Records * \\"You're Gone (feat.

The Preston Strike and Lune Street Riot, which took place in Preston, in Lancashire, England over 12 and 13 August 1842, were part of the 1842 General Strike or ‚ÄòPlug Plot Riots‚Äô. These strikes and disturbances were prompted by depression in 1841-2 which resulted in wage cuts of over 25%. They were influenced by the Chartist movement and the government's rejection of the petition for ‚ÄòPeople's Charter of 1838‚Äô, signed by over 1 million people who demanded a more democratic political system. Disputes spread throughout the North West of England from late July 1842. Workers in Manchester and Stockport struck on 10 August, Bolton on 11 August and in Preston a mass meeting was called for Friday 12th. The demands made at most of the strike meetings were for a return to 1840 wages and an acceptance of the Charter. One of the Chartist leaders was Preston handloom weaver Richard Marsden. ==The Preston Strike== The strike began on 12 August 1842 after a large meeting of around 3,000 cotton workers at Chadwick's Orchard ‚Äì now the site of Preston's Covered Market. They pledged to \\"strike work until they had a fair days wages for that work, guaranteeing its continuance with the Charter.\\" The Chartist newspaper The Northern Star reported that \\"Before night every cotton mill was turned out without resistance - all done chiefly by boys and girls\\".The Northern Star, 20 August 1842 The next day news spread that some mills had resumed work. The remaining strikers met in Chadwick's Orchard on Saturday morning, as early as 6am and went to Messrs. Sledden's machine shop on North Road and compelled workers there to turn out, \\"after several windows were broken and a few slight wounds inflicted on both sides.\\" They then started moving through Preston from factory to factory. The Mayor Samuel Horrocks, officials and the police were called upon to deal with the unrest and protect property. They enlisted the help of soldiers stationed in the town from the 72nd Highlanders to help stop the riot. ==Samuel Horrocks, Junior, Mayor of Preston, 1842== Samuel Horrocks was a member of the Horrocks family which had risen to prominence in Preston in the 1790s through the cotton trade. His uncle John and father Samuel Horrocks founded Horrockses which, by 1842, was Preston's largest cotton manufacturer. The family had become very wealthy and both John and Samuel Horrocks had served as Members of Parliament until their deaths in 1804 and 1842 respectively. Accompanying the Mayor were two local magistrates and mill owners George Jacson and John Bairstow. The officials also included the Town Clerk of Preston Corporation, Richard Palmer. Leading the police forces were Captain Woodford of the County rural police and Superintendent Bannister of the Preston Borough force. ==The final confrontation - Saturday 13 August== The strikers moved into the centre of town to Messrs Paley's Mill where they met Preston officials accompanied by about 30 soldiers from the 72nd Highlanders and members of the County and Borough police. Their final confrontation was on the bottom of Lune Street outside the Preston Corn Exchange. Members of the crowd including men, women and boys gathered stones from near the canal and began throwing them at the police and military. ==Reading of the Riot Act== The Mayor Samuel Horrocks read the Riot Act. This gave local authorities the right to use force if necessary to disperse unlawful assemblies and stop riots. When the violence escalated and the crowd did not disperse the military then fired, shooting at least eight men. The rioters then fled in shock and the injured men were taken to the House of Recovery. Accounts vary as to who exactly gave the order and how shots were fired, but, at the later trial of chartist leader Feargus O‚ÄôConnor, the police officer Mr Bannister stated that it was Samuel Horrocks who had given the order, but that he had not heard the order himself. Whatever the case, public discontent for the shooting was quickly directed at the Mayor Samuel Horrocks. ==Killed and injured== The four men who died were: *John Mercer - aged 27 of Ribbleton Lane, a handloom weaver. Mercer had a ball shot through his right arm, through his fifth rib and through his chest and out of the left side of the spine. *William Lancaster - aged 25 of Blackburn. He was wounded by a musket ball entering his chest and passing under the fourth rib on the left side. *George Sowerbutts - aged 19 of Chandler Street, a weaver at Gardner's Mill. He died from his injuries on Sunday evening. *Bernard McNamara - aged 17 of Birk Street, a cotton stripper employed at Oxendale's Mill, was shot through the right side of the belly, from which the bowels protruded to a great extent. He died on Monday afternoon at about 1.30pm. Those injured included: *William Pilling aged 21, a steam loom operator, who was struck by a bullet in the knee and taken to the Dispensary on Fishergate were his leg was amputated. *James Roberts, aged 20, a steam loom operator, who was struck in the hand which as a result was amputated. *Bryan Hodgson a shoe maker from St Peter's Square, who was shot in the back and had a bullet lodged in his spine. Despite this he survived and lived until 1878. ==Reaction to the shooting== Opinion was divided about the shooting. Some, including the Mayor, thought it was justified but regretted the loss of life. The Northern Star summed up the Chartist reaction to the shooting: > People could scarcely believe their senses. Riots had happened before in > Preston but never before had the military been ordered to fire. Another > attachment of the 7th Rifle Brigade, about 150 in number were marched into > town, and the 72nd were marched out, no doubt to stem popular fury, it being > the almost unanimous opinion that the Mayor ought to be tried for wilful > murder. Inquests into the deaths, by a local jury, were held in Preston at the county court where Richard Palmer acted as coroner. After hearing the evidence all four deaths were ruled to be \\"justified homicide\\". Twelve men were put on trial for their part in the disturbances and received prison sentences ranging from nine months to two years. ==The 1842 Memorial== The Preston Martyrs Memorial, Lune Street A permanent memorial in memory of the cotton workers was unveiled on Lune Street on 13 August 1992 - the 150th anniversary of the shooting. The memorial was designed and produced by the British artist and sculptor Gordon Young. It was inspired by Goya's painting The Third of May 1808 picturing Spanish civilians being executed in 1808 for resisting Napoleon‚Äôs troops. The memorial was funded and supported by the Preston Trades Union Council, Preston Labour History Group, Preston Borough Council, Lancashire County Council, the Art Department of Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire) and North West Arts. It was hoped that the placing of the memorial in Preston would remind people now and in the future that \\"Never without sacrifice have gains been made towards justice and democracy\\". The drinking establishment adjacent to the statues is named 1842 as of 2016 in reference to the date of the shooting. ==The Preston Passion== The Lune Street shooting and the story of Mayor Samuel Horrocks inspired one of the Preston Passion dramas, \\"Preston 1842\\" , which was screened live on television as part of the 2012 Preston Passion event. The event was centred at Preston Bus Station and took place on 6 April 2012, as part of the 2012 Preston Guild. ==Further reading== *Leigh, J.S., (2007), Preston Cotton Martyrs: the millworkers who shocked a nation, Palatine Books. *Lewis, Brian, (2002) \\"The Middlemost and the Milltowns: Bourgeois Culture and Politics in Early Industrial England\\", Stanford, Stanford University Press. \\"The General Strike of 1842\\", Mick Jenkins, Lawrence and Wishart, 1980 ==References== Category:1842 in England Category:Chartism Category:Riots and civil disorder in England Category:History of Preston Category:1842 riots Category:19th century in Lancashire Category:August 1842 events Category:1840s in Lancashire ","title":"Preston Strike of 1842"},{"id":"35345483","text":"Dr. Mahar Mangahas is the president of Philippine-based opinion survey firm Social Weather Stations (SWS).

Prey collected by A. nigerrimus include spiders from the families Lycosidae, Gnaphosidae and Pisauridae. A nigerrimus builds nests under stones, in cavities in stone walls, in hollow plant stems, in deserted burrows of ants, bees or wasps, and in empty snail shells. It can also dig a burrow and build cells in friable soil. One nest of four cells was found under a stone on moorland at an altitude of 400 m in Glen Tilt, near Blair Atholl, Perthshire.

As it can be observed all systems are divided into main two groups prefabricated (which is made in factories) and those posts that are made in laboratory or in surgeries. In the next step each group is divided into two subgroups according to their counter-sink constructions including their position. In the other steps either the system is symmetrical or non-symmetrical is another important fact that is pointed out. In the Nankali post and core classification the outline surfaces, threaded, smooth and serrated are profoundly discussed, in addition to the other mentioned directions. Because posts can be made from different justified dental materials such as Stainless Steel, Titanium, Titanium Alloy, Gold-Plated brass, Carbon and Ceramic, to avoid complications in understanding this classification the choice of material is not placed. All posts and cores can also be made as a one part or more parts. ==Advantages of Nankali Post and Core classification== This classification answers different questions related to the posts and cores which help professionals to clarify the clinical indications more appropriately. Another important advantage of this classification is that it gives dentists ability to compare the systems in a very clear way, which may help them to plans their treatment faster and properly. ==Disdvantages of Nankali Post and Core classification== Because it is tried to cover the maximum required information, the size of this classification became large and it required time to analyse it, yet, after understanding the classification it became very useful and simple. ==About other classifications== There are a number of posts with different designs and clinical indications that are used in restorative dentistry and due to this wide range of provided posts and cores, professionals are not any more able to use the general conventional clinical indication which were discussed similarly in many referral books. This is the reason that posts and cores' classification start to play an important role in understanding and verifying the type of these micro-prosthesis. The popularity of these Classifications in the world is not similar and they are mainly related to the professionals, referral books and publications that is used in particular country. Language is another issue which change the conditions. For instance, in some countries, a number of posts are banded and in some others they are not approved yet or unknown to be used by dentists. One of the very old types of post and cores classification is according to their authors and still in some ways it is used. Yet, the main issues with this classification are the repetition of the systems and also the minimum required information about the system is required to be able to recognise a particular post. Furthermore, it is very difficult to put all the names in the posts' classification, although by using it we will appreciate the authors. Having in mind that there are many authors, here a partial example of this classification is illustrated. *Classification of post and cores according to their authors: 1-Ahmmedov 2-Davis 3-L.V. Illinoi- Markasian (–õ. –í. –ò–ª—å–∏–Ω–æ–π ‚Äì –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ—Å—è–Ω) 4-A.I. Kats (–ê.–Ø. –ö–∞—Ü) 5-Kopeikin (–ö–æ–ø–µ–π–∫–∏–Ω) 6-A. Nankali 7-Orton 8-V. N.

Sitrin 13-... *Classification of post and cores according to their method of production: 1-Pre-fabricated 2-Cast made. *Classification of post and cores according to their outlines: 1-Parallel 2-Tapered 3-Serrated Classification of post and cores according to their surface: 1-Simple (straight) 2-Formed (shaped) ==History== In 1998, Dr. Ali Nankali, as one of the people who were interested in restorative dentistry, started to worked on application of posts and cores by analysing and studying the available systems and in 2003 after five years research he modified some of the existing classifications, and as a result he proposed to the scientific board of the Orthopaedic and Implant department of the National Medical University a new classification to explain some misunderstandings. Using mathematical models and cast models, Dr. Ali Nankali was able to analyse, compare and categorise the structures in different ways which was a part of this study. Thus, the Nankali's post and core classification is based on designs, methods of production, retention/resistance systems and clinical indications. There was an established interesting outcome, which was explained that many dentists do not use posts in their appropriate way, which means they apply them in the way that they understand by themselves, and this fact causes two main problems, consuming time and failing the post. ==References== * Makhnitski M.B.(1999) The New Post System.

He was a sea captain and a one time friend of Robert Burns who is credited by Burns as the being the person who \\"encouraged me to endeavour at the character of a Poet.\\" ==Life and character== Richard Brown was born in Irvine, the son of a 'plain mechanic' named William Brown and his wife Jane Whinie. Richard had a wealthy patron who gave him a good education, but the patron died, dashing Brown's chances of bettering his situation in life. He went to sea, where after many ups and downs he ending up being robbed by an American privateer on the wild coast of Connaught. He had fought for the liberty of the Americans against the British, and the American struggle for freedom, obvious in the poet's early poems; the poet's sympathy for the colonists can at least in part be attributed to Brown. Later he became captain of a large West Indiaman, the Mary & Jean, belonging to the Thames and sailing to such destinations as Grenada in the southeastern Caribbean Sea. A Sunday in Eglinton Woods. Burns describes him as \\"This gentleman's mind was fraught with courage, independence, magnanimity, and every noble manly virtue.\\" Other views of Richard Brown was less charitable, such as: \\"That moral leper who spoke of illicit love with all the levity of a sailor\\".Harvey, page 120. Gilbert Burns says of Robert's days in Irvine that he here \\"contracted some acquaintances of a freer manner of thinking and living than he had been used to, whose society prepared him for overleaping the bounds of rigid virtue, which had hitherto restrained him\\". Robert himself stated that Brown's views on illicit love \\"did me a mischief\\".Wilson, page 13 Richard Brown married Helen or Eleanora Blair, daughter of David Blair (b.1736) and Ann MuirBlair, Page 1 of Girtridge Mill in Dundonald Parish,Hunter, Page 234 on 30 May 1785, and settled in Port Glasgow. The couple had six children, named Jean (christened 24/2/1786 in Dundonald parish), Anne (chr. 5/9/1788 at Girtrigg), William (5/8/1790), Eleonora (11/8/1792), Alexander (13/6/1796, to \\"Richard Brown Shipmaster in Port Glasgow and Helen Blair his spouse\\"), and David (28/8/1799), the last four all christened at Port Glasgow.Irvine Burns Club Retrieved : 2012-04-05 In later life, Richard Brown became very respectable, and, although he is said by some to have quarrelled violently with Burns, the reason remains unknown as the poet's allegations that he had taught Burns the art of seduction were not published until four years after his death.Hempstead, Page 92 When living at Port Glasgow he was noted to be interested in education and religion, with a hospitable, kind and generous nature.Hempstead, Page 92 He was also keen on shooting. ==Association with Robert Burns== Robert Burns by Alexander Nasmyth, 1787 Robert Burns lived in Irvine during the years 1781‚Äì1782, at the age of 23, (1759‚Äì1796) for a period of around 9 months,Dougall, page 232.Douglas, page 24. whilst learning the craft of flax-dressing from his mother's half- brother, Alexander Peacock, working at the heckling shop in the Glasgow Vennel.Hogg, page 56. During this time he made a number of acquaintances, befriended several locals and in particular struck up a lasting friendship with Richard Brown, with whom he took regular walks into the Eglinton Woods via the old Irvine-to-Kilwinning toll road and the Drukken or Drucken (Drunken)Scots Dictionary Steps over the Red Burn and back via the site of Saint Brides or Bryde's Well at Stanecastle.Boyle, page 48. The cairn commemorating the association of Richard Brown and Robert Burns in Irvine. In his Autobiographical Letter to Dr Hunter, Burns says of this intimate friendship: \\"I formed a bosom friendship with a young fellow, the first created being I had ever seen, but a hapless son of misfortune.\\" \\"I loved him, I admired him to a degree of enthusiasm; and I strove to imitate him. In some measure I succeeded: I had the pride before, but he taught it to flow in proper channels. His knowledge of the world was vastly superiour to mine, and I was all attention to learn. He was the only man I ever saw who was a greater fool than myself when WOMAN was the presiding star; but he spoke of a certain fashionable failing with levity, which hitherto I had regarded with horror. Here his friendship did me a mischief, and the consequence was, that soon after I resumed the plough.\\" Upon hearing of this, Richard Brown is said to have commented that:\\"Illicit love! Levity of a sailor! When I first knew Burns he had nothing to learn in that respect.\\"Annandale, V.1, Page 146 The now married Brown, settled with children and respectable members of society in Port Glasgow, took Burns's comments regarding womanising very badly and this resulted in an enmity that lasted until Burns's death. Mackay and others however point out that the letter that made the insinuations was not published until 1800, four years after Burns' death and whatever the cause of the death of their friendship was, it was not this.Mackay, Page 106 On 30 December 1787, Burns wrote to Brown saying: \\"Do you recollect a Sunday we spent in Eglinton woods? You told me, on my repeating some verses to you, that you wondered I could resist the temptation of sending verses of such merit to a magazine: 'twas actually this that gave me an idea of my own pieces which encouraged me to endeavour at the character of a Poet.\\" Adding that : \\"Almighty Love still \\"reigns and revels\\" in my bosom; and I am at this moment ready to hang myself for a young Edinr. Widow.\\" The widow, as he puts it, was Clarinda. This letter provides clues as to when Burns's regular marriage to Jean Armour took place. On 21 May 1789 Burns wrote to Brown from Mauchline saying: \\"wishing you would always set me down as your bosom friend - wishing you long life and prosperity and that every good thing may attend you - wishing Mrs Brown and your little ones as few of the evils of this world as is consistent with humanity ... wishing that if there is to be another state of existence, Mrs Brown, Mrs Burns, our little ones in both families, and you and I in some snug paradisical retreat, may make a jovial Party to all eternity! ...

In a letter written in answer to correspondence from Richard Brown of 28 February 1788, Burns, then at Mauchline, relates to his \\"Dear friend\\", in March 1788, how he found Jean, on his return from Edinburgh, pregnant by him for a second time, and cast out by her family: I found Jean ‚Äî with her cargo very well laid in; but unfortunately moor'd almost at the mercy of the wind and tide: I have towed her into convenient harbour where she may lie snug till she unload; and have taken the command myself ‚Äî not ostensibly, but for a time, in secret.Burns Encyclopedia Retrieved : 2012-04-06 On 4 November 1789, in a two- page letter Burns acknowledges and welcomes Brown's news.

Burns goes on to explain that he cannot travel to meet Brown anywhere on account of his Excise duties and encourages Brown to come and visit him.

It is called the Independent State of Azawad. ==History== Following the return of 5k soldiers after the Libyan Civil War in 2011 and the formation of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, an insurgency commenced on 17 January 2012 with an attack in the Kidal Region, near the border with Algeria. Following the March coup d'√©tat, the rebels made further inroads to capture the three biggest cities of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu in three days, respectively. At this point, other factions joined the fighting, including the Islamist Ansar Dine and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa. Despite reports of Ansar Dine taking control of most of what was initially captured by or with the help of the MNLA, the group established their writ over large swathes of the territory. The Tuareg peoples had also long complained of marginalisation within Mali. ==Declaration of Independence== The Secretary-General of the MNLA, Bilal ag Acherif, signed the declaration in Gao, the site of the largest Malian military outpost in the north, on 6 April 2012. It was announced by Moussa ag Attaher on France 24. The declaration was issued in French on behalf of the \\"voice of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad\\" and in consultation with the Executive Committee, the Revolutionary Council, the Consultative Council, the State- Major of the Army of Liberation and the regional offices. It also cited as reasoning France's unilateral attachment of the region to Mali despite an appeal to French President Charles de Gaulle. The document concluded by adding that the new state declared by the MNLA would recognise international state borders, despite having split the traditional Azawagh over several modern-day states; absolute accordance with the United Nations Charter; and a commitment by the MNLA to establish the \\"conditions for a durable peace\\" and create state institutions in accordance with a democratic constitution. Before \\"irrevocably\\" acclaiming the Independent State of Azawad, the document called on the Executive Committee, who would run the country in the interim period, to invite the international community to immediately recognise the new state in the interests of \\"justice and peace\\". Reactions The day before the declaration, the Foreign Ministry of Algeria said that an armed faction raided the Algerian consulate in the northeast kidnapping the consul and six staff members. Though Attaher called it \\"deplorable\\", he said the MNLA went along with the action in order not to result in deaths. The AFP also quoted a Malian military source as saying that to the best of Malian Army's intelligence \\"the MNLA is in charge of nothing at the moment... it is Iyad [Ag Ghaly] who is the strongest and he is with AQIM\\". His Ansar Dine said that it was \\"against rebellions. We are against independence. We are against revolutions not in the name of Islam.\\" Some of the MLNA's leadership were also said to have been surprised by the declaration. Europe-based Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed, one of the spokesmen of the MNLA and the head of external relations, said: \\"I think it's premature ‚Äî premature to speak of this right now, without a consultation and an understanding with some of the actors that are very active on the local level, and with which we need to work, and we need to find common objectives, common strategies.\\" Supranational bodies *African Union: The AU rejected the UDI as \\"null and of no value whatsoever\\" and appealed to the rest of the world to ignore it. The AU's commission chairperson Jean Ping's office issued a statement that read he \\"calls on the international community as a whole to fully support this principled position of Africa\\". *Economic Community of West African States: ECOWAS declared they would \\"take all necessary measures, including the use of force, to ensure the territorial integrity\\" of Mali. ECOWAS announced preparations for a 3,000 personnel intervention force to contain the rebels and protect the constitution of Mali. *: The spokeswoman for the Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, said that the EU respected Mali's territorial integrity. Richard Zinc, EU representative in Bamako, said that it was \\"out of question\\" that the EU would accept the declaration. States *: Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said Azawad's northern neighbour country would never \\"accept questioning Mali's territorial integrity\\". However, he also rejected foreign intervention and called for a solution through dialogue. *: Chris Day, an aide to Foreign Minister John Baird, stated that Canada's position on Azawad's independence: \\"We‚Äôre absolutely not recognising this declaration. We are closely monitoring events on the ground.\\" *: Defence Minister G√©rard Longuet reacted by saying: \\"A unilateral declaration of independence which is not recognised by African states would not have any meaning for us.\\" Foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said the declaration was \\"null and void\\". He affirmed France's commitment to the \\"territorial integrity of Mali\\". On the other hand, Valero admitted that \\"the demands of the northern Tuareg population are old and for too long had not received adequate and necessary responses\\". France, however, also indicated it would offer military assistance to the ECOWAS force aimed at stabilising Mali and containing the rebels. *: In a statement the same day as the declaration, the presidential special envoy to Africa Mikhail Margelov rejected the formation of the state. \\"There are virtually no chances, this is undoubted, for [the] legitimization of a Tuareg state.\\" \\"[The Sahelian countries, the ECOWAS, and the AU] do not need it. We stand unequivocally for the territorial integrity and restoration of the constitutional order in Mali.\\" *: Patrick Ventrell, a spokesman of the U.S. State Department stated: \\"We reject the MNLA's statement of independence and reiterate our call for the territorial integrity of Mali.\\" The State Department also later expressed concern that the separation would \\"only exacerbate the grave problems challenging the Malian state\\". Academia Alessandra Giuffrida of the African Studies Department at the School of Oriental and African Studies said: > [The MNLA] is taking advantage of a new situation:the lack of a > constitutional government and power vacuum in Bamako after the coup. This is > a new fact which has never occurred before in the history of the Tuareg in > Mali.

He was originally trained in Italy, where he won eight races at the ages of three and four including the Group One Premio Vittorio di Capua. He was then bought by Godolphin Racing and was trained in Britain and the United Arab Emirates by Saeed Bin Suroor. For his new connections Ramonti won three of Britain's most important mile races in 2007, before winning the ten furlong Hong Kong Cup. At the end of the season he was one of the highest- ranked racehorses in the world over one mile. Ramonti was retired to stud after a single unsuccessful start in 2008. He is currently based in Poland. ==Background== Ramonti is a dark-coated bay horse with a small white star standing 16.2¬Ω hands high. He was bred in France by Emilio Balzarini's Scuderia Siba, a breeding organisation based near Brescia in Italy, and originally raced in the colours of Balzarini's Scuderia Antezzate. Ramonti was sent into training with the brothers Giuseppe and Alduino Botti and was ridden in his early career by Giuseppe's son Endo. During the most successful period of his career, Ramonti raced with a tongue-tie. Ramonti's sire, Martino Alonso, won six races and finished placed in the Premio Roma and the Premio Vittorio di Capua before retiring to stand at the Siba stud. In his first season at stud, he attracted little interest, and sired only nineteen foals, including Ramonti. After Ramonti's success made Martino Alonso a more popular stallion he was kidnapped in November 2009 and recovered by police six months later. He died following a paddock accident in March 2012. Ramonti's dam, Fosca was an American-bred daughter of El Gran Senor and a direct descendant of the Fillies Triple Crown winner Meld. ==Racing career== 2005: three- year-old season Ramonti was unraced as a two-year-old and began his career by winning a 1400m race at Milan's San Siro Racecourse on 30 March 2005. Eleven days later he was moved up to Listed class and won the Premio Daumier over 1600m at the Capannelle Racecourse in Rome. Two weeks later over the same course and distance he was raised in class again for the Group Two Premio Parioli, Italy's equivalent of the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Edmondo Botti, he took the lead 200m from the finish and drew clear to win \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Le Giare. Ramonti was then moved up in class and distance for the Group One Derby Italiano at the Capannelle on 22 May. Despite racing over a distance 800m further than he had previously attempted, he was made favourite at odds of 1/2 against fourteen opponents. Botti sent Ramonti to the front from the start and he continued to lead into the straight. In the last 200m however, he appeared to tire and was caught in the closing stages and beaten a head by De Sica. Ramonti did not run again that season. 2006: four-year-old season In April 2006, Ramonti made his first appearance for more than ten months when he won a minor stakes race over 1600m at San Siro. In May he finished second in a Listed race at the Capannelle and then won a similar event in Milan by five lengths, suggesting that he was returning to his best form. In June Ramonti returned to Group class to win the Premio Emilio Turati by two and a half lengths from Ryono. Two months later, his first race in international company ended in failure as he finished seventh of the ten runners behind Librettist and Manduro in the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville Racecourse. Returning to Italy, Ramonti was surprisingly beaten at odds of 1/4 in a Listed race in Milan and then contested the Group One Premio Vittorio di Capua at the same course in October. Ridden as usual by Botti, Ramonti led from the start and pulled clear of his opponents in the straight to record his first Group One win by beating the British-trained favourite Notability by two and a half lengths. The Racing Post described Ramonti's win as \\"a brilliant front-running performance\\". On his final European start of the year, Ramonti started at odds of 2/5 in the Premio Ribot and won by five lengths from Mullins Bay, having led from the start. He was then sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile in which he made the running and then stayed on after being headed in the straight to finish third to the locally trained runners The Duke and Armada. At the end of the year, Ramonti was sold to the Godolphin Racing organisation and transferred to the stable of Saeed Bin Suroor, spending the winters in Dubai and the rest of the year based at Newmarket in England. 2007: five-year-old season Ramonti's first start for his new connections came in the Group One Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury on 19 May. Before the race Saeed Bin Suroor had expressed his satisfaction with Ramonti, describing him as a \\"nice and honest\\" horse. Ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori he was restrained in the early stages and raced just behind the leaders until making his challenge a furlong from the end of the race. In a closely contested finish, he failed by a head to catch the four-year-old filly Red Evie. A month later, Ramonti appeared at Royal Ascot where he contested the Queen Anne Stakes on the first day of the meeting. On this occasion, Dettori allowed the horse to make the running and he held the lead into the straight. Two furlongs from the finish he was headed by the Michael Stoute-trained Jeremy, but rallied \\"gamely\\" in the closing stages to regain the lead and win by a short head. The previous year's leading three-year-old George Washington finished fourth, with Red Evie in seventh. After the race Godolphin's spokesman Simon Crisford admitted that the team were surprised by Ramonti's performance, saying that \\"we didn't anticipate he'd be winning this - we thought he would be a horse who we would campaign abroad.\\" Dettori was subsequently disciplined by the Jockey Club stewards for excessive use of the whip on the winner. On 1 August Ramonti and Jeremy were matched against each other again in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Ramonti raced in fifth place before moving forward to take the lead two furlongs from the finish. He quickly opened up a clear lead and stayed on strongly to hold the late challenge of the favourite Excellent Art by a head, with Jeremy third and Asiatic Boy in fourth. Ramonti and Frankie Dettori return after winning the Hong Kong Cup In September, Ramonti was sent to France for the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp. He led 400m from the finish but was overtaken and beaten two lengths by the three-year-old filly Darjina. Three weeks later, Ramonti ran in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot and started at odd of 5/1 in a field which included Excellent Art, Darjina and Duke of Marmalade. Ramonti tracked the leaders in until moving into the lead in the straight. He went two lengths clear and was driven out by Dettori to win by half a length from Excellent Art. On his final appearance of the year, he traveled to Hong Kong to run in the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Cup over ten furlongs, the longest distance he had attempted since his defeat in the Derby Italiano two and a half years earlier. In the Cup he was pitted against the leading local runners Viva Pataca, who started odds on favourite, and Vengeance of Rain. He raced in third before taking the lead in the straight and held the late challenge of Viva Pataca to win by half a length. Mick Kinane on the runner-up was unable to obtain a clear run and lodged a formal objection to the winner, but the racecourse stewards allowed Ramonti to keep the race after an inquiry. Dettori called Ramonti \\"probably one of the bravest horses I've ever ridden.\\" Ramonti remained in training as a six-year-old, but a leg infection delayed his preparation and he missed the first half of the season. In July he reappeared in the Group Two Summer Mile at Ascot in which he finished a disappointing fifth to Archipenko. A recurrence of his leg problems ruled him out for the rest of the season and he was retired to stud. ==Assessment== Timeform described Ramonti as \\"most genuine and consistent\\", and awarded him a rating of 126. In the 2006 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Ramonti was given a rating of 116, the highest for any Italian-trained horse that year, placing him just outside the world's top one hundred racehorses. A year later, he was rated on 123, placing him equal thirteenth in the world ratings, level with Rags to Riches and Notnowcato.

Medieval in origin, the church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is the elder of the two active Anglican parish churches in the town, located in the deanery of Skipton, the archdeaconry of Craven, and the Diocese of Leeds. Its benefice is united with that of a church in a neighbouring village, St Augustine, Draughton. ==History== The first church on the site was built in the early 12th century, probably in wood. The present church dates from about 1300, and was extended to the east in the late 15th century. The church was damaged during the Civil War, and was repaired and restored in the 1650s with financial assistance from Lady Anne Clifford of Skipton Castle, whose father's tomb is in the church. In 1853 the tower was struck by lightning. The church was restored in 1909 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. During this process, the galleries were removed, a north transept and new vestries were added, and new seating was installed. The church was struck by lightning again in 1925, causing a fire that destroyed the organ and damaged the roof. The roof was repaired, and a new organ case was installed, again by Austin and Paley. In 1979 the Lady Chapel was created in the southeast corner of the church, and more recently a Prayer Corner was developed in a corresponding position at the northeast of the church. ==Architecture== The plan of the church consists of a nave with a clerestory, a south porch, a north transept containing the organ and vestries, a chancel with the Lady Chapel to the south and the Prayer Corner to the north, and a west tower embraced by the nave. The window tracery is mainly in Perpendicular style, with some in Decorated style. The font stands at the west end of the nave, and has a Jacobean cover. The rood screen dates from 1533. In the chancel is a triple sedilia. There are monuments in the church dating from the 16th and 17th centuries to the memory of members of the Clifford family. One of the windows contains stained glass by Kempe. The original pipe organ was built in 1803 by Lincoln of London. It was sited in a gallery on the northeast of the church, and had been moved by 1855 to the southeast corner of the church. In 1875 a new organ was built by Jardine, and it was moved in 1888 to a new organ chamber on the northeast of the church by Abbott and Smith of Leeds. Following the destruction of this organ in 1925, a new three-manual organ, built by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool and designed by Edward Bairstow, was installed. This organ was rebuilt and reduced to two manuals in two phases in 1966 and 1970, and moved into the left bay of the north transept by Laycock and Bannister of Keighley. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast by John Taylor & Co. of Loughborough in 1921. ==Burials== *Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland *George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland ==See also== *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895‚Äì1914) *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1916‚Äì44) ==References== Citations Sources * * Skipton Skipton Category:English Gothic architecture in North Yorkshire Category:Churches completed in 1925 Category:Anglican Diocese of Leeds Category:Austin and Paley buildings ","title":"Holy Trinity Church, Skipton"},{"id":"35346547","text":"Sean Paul Terry (born 1 August 1991 in Southampton, Hampshire) is a former Irish cricketer.

He was part of the New Zealand under-20 rugby team that won the 2011 IRB Junior World Championship in Italy. Perenara is currently Captain of the Hurricanes, alongside Dane Coles and is the most-capped Hurricane of all time. Perenara made his international debut for New Zealand in 2014 and has since played 64 tests for his country, having attended both the 2015 Rugby World Cup and 2019 Rugby World Cup during his international career. ==Early life and family== Perenara was born in Porirua, New Zealand and grew up in the suburb of Titahi Bay. His father Thomas (whose father hails from Matata) played for the Junior Kiwis in 1987 and in the New Zealand Softball Team (Black Sox) from 1987 to 1996. His mother Fiona (Farrow) played softball for New Zealand as did his grandmother Patricia Farrow and his uncle Jason Farrow. Perenara's paternal grandmother was born in Broken Hill, Australia. Two of his cousins, Henry and Marcus, played in the National Rugby League competition. He is also distantly related to All Black teammate, Sonny Bill Williams, as well as Samoan international rugby player, Tim Nanai-Williams.TJ Perenara confident of full recovery, The Dominion Post, 28 June 2012 He is of Te Arawa and NgƒÅti Rangitihi descent. ==Career== Early career Perenara scored a hat-trick of tries on his Super Rugby debut in a 46‚Äì19 victory against the Western Force in Perth on 10 March 2012. Perenara quickly became a regular starter for the team. He was selected for the All Blacks squad for the 2013 Rugby Championship but was not capped that year. After finishing the 2014 Super Rugby season with five tries, he made his All Blacks debut in the first test against England in 2014, along with centre Malakai Fekitoa. Perenara scored his first test try for the All Blacks in a 34-13 win against Argentina that year after replacing Aaron Smith off the bench. Perenara then went on to start for the first time in his international career against the United States, only being replaced with nine minutes to go. Perenara played in all three remaining tests on the end-of-year tour, including a start against Scotland. 2015‚Äì2016 Perenara scored the second-to-most tries of any player in the 2015 Super Rugby season behind Highlanders winger Waisake Naholo, scoring eleven tries for the Hurricanes that season. Following the end of the Super Rugby season, Perenara started against Argentina for the All Blacks. He was named in New Zealand's ultimately victorious 2015 Rugby World Cup squad, playing in two matches, including a start against Namibia. Perenara was named vice-captain of the Hurricanes following Conrad Smith's departure to Pau. Perenara captained the Hurricanes multiple times in 2016 due to injuries to regular captain Dane Coles, including the semi-final against the Chiefs. Perenara was also named man of the match against the Sharks in the quarter-final, where he scored a try in the 41-0 victory, the first time in Super Rugby history that a losing team did not score any points in a knockout round. Perenara was initially left out of New Zealand's All Blacks squad in 2016, but was called up as injury cover for Tawera Kerr-Barlow. Perenara and Kerr-Barlow were both kept in the squad for the Rugby Championship, the All Blacks deciding to have three halfbacks in the squad. During the competition, Aaron Smith began to decrease in form quality after having multiple off-field incidents. Perenara earned a start against Argentina in the championship, keeping the starting spot over Kerr-Barlow for the rest of the competition. He scored 4 tries during the competition, including two tries against South Africa and what was later nominated for Try of The Year against Argentina. Perenara has been used as New Zealand's Haka leader since Smith's off-field incidents too. Towards the end of 2016 Perenara was established as New Zealand's first-choice halfback, upon Aaron Smith's decline in performance after his return to the international field. Perenara ended 2016 as one of the team's top try-scorers after scoring his fifth of the year in the historic 40-29 loss to Ireland in Chicago. 2017 After captaining the Hurricanes to an 83-17 win over the Sunwolves to open their season, Perenara took over as captain of the team and led the team in every single match of the year except for four. This happened after Dane Coles was badly concussed in round three against the Chiefs. Coles did not return to action until the knockout rounds. Coles relieved Perenara of captaincy in the semi-final. Perenara scored the opening try of the semi-final in Johannesburg, but the Hurricanes suffered a 29-44 loss to the Lions in the match. Perenara became the highest try-scorer of all halfbacks in Super Rugby history in 2017 where he scored his 44th try and seventh of the 2017 season in the semi-final loss to the Lions in Johannesburg. Perenara scored his first try of the 2018 Super Rugby campaign against the Crusaders to score his 45th try. Perenara has the second-to-most tries of 48 tries than any active Super Rugby player behind New South Wales Waratahs fullback Israel Folau. Despite an outstanding Super Rugby campaign, Perenara went back to being the second- choice halfback with Aaron Smith returning to better form. This was made clear in the 2017 Pasifika Challenge against Samoa where Perenara replaced Smith in the 56th minute of the 78-0 win, scoring a try in the 71st minute. Smith started as halfback in all three tests against the British and Irish Lions in 2017, with Perenara coming off the bench as a reserve in those three matches. Perenara lead the Haka in every single test against the Lions. He carried a heavy workload for the All Blacks in 2017, playing in 14 matches that year and leading the haka in all of those, including starts against Argentina which was a 39-22 win and the Barbarians in a 31-22 win, scoring a try against the Barbarians in that fixture, that was not a capped fixture. Perenara only missed one test that year, which was the last 2017 Rugby Championship fixture, against South Africa. 2018 Perenara was expected to take over as Hurricanes captain for 2018, with Dane Coles ruled out for the season, due to a torn ACL, sustained against France in 2017. Perenara remained as vice- captain, however, with the departing flanker Brad Shields named as captain for his last season with the Hurricanes, instead of Perenara or Coles as captain. He struggled with injury early in the year, but still scored six tries during the 2018 Super Rugby season. Perenara's most notable contribution to the Hurricanes in 2018 was his Man-of-the-Match performance against the Chiefs in the semi-final, scoring two tries and performing a try-saving tackle on Chiefs flanker Lachlan Boshier. Perenara was again selected for the All Blacks in 2018, but received the first yellow card of his international career during the 2018 Steinlager series, against France. His second-half yellow card came in the 63rd minute of the second test, for an offside, during the controversial 26-13 victory, which also saw France's Benjamin Fall red-carded. After 8 consecutive appearances off the bench, since 2017, Perenara was selected to start for the All Blacks against Argentina, on 8 September 2018, during the 2018 Rugby Championship. Perenara had an outstanding 71-minute performance that included two tries and solid defence, bringing his international try tally to 10 tries from 48 tests. Perenara was subbed off for All Black debutant and former Hurricanes teammate Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, with the All Blacks beating Argentina 46-24. Perenara was named Man of the Match, although his performance was not perfect, as he missed a tackle on Ramiro Moyano, leading to Argentina scoring the opening try. The following week of the Rugby Championship saw Perenara replace Aaron Smith off the bench, in the 49th minute, in a test against South Africa, after a poor performance from Smith. Perenara performed far better than Smith, but failed to assist his country manage a victory. A mostly one-sided first-half saw New Zealand lose to South Africa, 34-36, in an unexpected loss. On 29 September 2018, Perenara played his 50th test for New Zealand, only four years after his international debut. The fixture saw Perenara play for 66 minutes until being replaced by Aaron Smith, the All Black debut of Angus Ta'avao and their third consecutive win of the Rugby Championship competition. The All Blacks won the test, 35-17. Perenara only played in the last 10 minutes during the following test, the last Rugby Championship test, which was a narrow 32-30 win over South Africa. Aaron Smith's fading form saw Perenara begin his 2018 end-of-year tour with a start in the third Bledisloe Cup test, against Australia, in a 37-20 win. After key members of the All Blacks, including the likes of Perenara and Captain Kieran Read, missed the test against Japan, Perenara was named on the bench prior to the 10 November test against England. Perenara performed poorly against England and could potentially have cost New Zealand a win, with England replacement forward, Courtney Lawes, charging down a box-kick from Perenara to set Sam Underhill up, for what could have been England's winning try. The try was not given to England by the referee however, as Lawes was deemed to be offside. New Zealand narrowly won against England, 16-15. Perenara was subsequently benched for the 17 November loss to Ireland, which was a 9-16 against New Zealand. After the big games against England and Ireland, Perenara finished the season off with a start against Italy. He scored the opening try against Italy off a pass from winger, Jordie Barrett, before being replaced by Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, in the 51st minute of the test, which ended the season in a 66-3 victory. 2019 Starting the season alongside club captain Dane Coles, Perenara had to assume the captaincy when Coles was injured. Under his leadership, the Hurricanes suffered a loss to the Crusaders and a draw with the Chiefs, which was further fractionalized by a second loss to the Crusaders at home on 29 March. From Round 8 on, the Hurricanes enjoyed an unbroken run of victories until Round 14, when the Jaguares South American side defeated them for the first time ever, 20-28 in Wellington. Perenara was rejoined by Dane Coles for the sides tour of South Africa, where two wins boosted the side's chances, as they would end the regular season with a 29-24 win over the Blues that earned a home quarterfinal game against the Bulls. His side won that game 35-28, but it would see the Hurricanes face the Crusaders in the Super Rugby semifinals. Losing that game 30-26 in Christchurch, Perenara would remonstrate that a late interference by Sam Whitelock would influence his team ending the 'Canes 2019 season run. Perenara was widely regarded as the Hurricanes' Most Valuable Player of the 2019 Super Rugby season. Perenara played nine tests for New Zealand in 2019, including five at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, where the All Blacks finished in third place. He was awarded the IRP Try of the Year in 2019, finishing a well- executed team try, during New Zealand's 71-9 Pool Stage win over Namibia. ==Personal life== Perenara is known for his support of social issues, having spoken widely of his support for inclusiveness and diversity in rugby. In response to Israel Folau's controversial comments on same-sex marriage, Perenara tweeted in support of the rainbow community.. He has expressed continued support for LGBT issues, commenting that he thinks New Zealand is ready for a gay All Black. Perenara has followed a vegan diet since November 2019, after being a vegetarian for two years. Talking about his first switch to a vegetarian diet, he said: \\"I ate meat until about two years ago. I started on the India tour-- I was massive on the environment, pollution, stuff like that. And then I watched the documentary called Cowspiracy. It talked about how much agricultural farming accounts for pollution in the world and I was like man, I can't really say I care about it if I eat meat. My journey is to become vegan, so that's what I'll get to.\\" In early 2020, Perenara and his wife Greer announced they were expecting their first child. He is also a distant relative of former All Black Sonny Bill Williams. ==References *TJ Perenara Hurricanes profile *Wellington profile *IRB profile *itsrugby.co.uk profile Category:1992 births Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:New Zealand people of Australian descent Category:Hurricanes (rugby union) players Category:Wellington rugby union players Category:Rugby union scrum-halves Category:Living people Category:People from Porirua Category:People educated at Mana College Category:New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union players Category:Te Arawa Category:NgƒÅti Rangitihi ","title":"TJ Perenara"},{"id":"35346577","text":"Gabi-Gabi, or Gubbi-Gubbi, is a language of Queensland in Australia, formerly spoken on Fraser Island.

He is also famous for being a guitarist of the Japanese band Supercar. == Biography == Ishiwatari found an ad looking for band members that had been posted by Miki Furukawa at an musical instrument store in Hachinohe. He made contact with her in 1995, invited his childhood friend K≈çji Nakamura, and while still in high school they formed a band. K≈çdai Tazawa later joined the band, which was named Supercar. Supercar made its debut with a major label in 1997 and in 1998 it released the influential debut album, Three Out Change. Music critic Ian Martin has called it \\"one of the all-time great Japanese rock albums.\\" Ishiwatari played guitar and wrote all the lyrics. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Supercar continued to perform and produced albums that increasingly combined alternative rock with electronic music. Supercar has been characterized as having \\"almost foundational importance to 21st century Japanese indie rock\\". The band broke up in 2005, and Ishiwatari began working as a lyricist and record producer. In 2010, Ishiwatari released the single \\"Kamisama no Iut≈çri\\" with Yoshinori Sunahara who was a former member of Denki Groove. They featured Etsuko Yakushimaru (S≈çtaisei Riron etc.) as a vocalist.

The case upheld the concept that an owner of interest in land which was originally obtained from the rightful owner through fraud, still obtains an indefeasible interest in that title if they were unaware of the fraud. == Background == Mr Alan Frederick Frazer and his wife Flora Agnes Frazer, jointly were the registered owners of a dairy farm in New Zealand under the Land Transfer Act [1952]. In 1961 Mrs Frazer borrowed ¬£3,000 ($121,214 in 2011 dollars) from Mr and Mrs Radomski using the jointly owned property as security for the loan without her husband's knowledge or consent. For the mortgage to be legally valid for a jointly owned property, the mortgage contract needed both owners' signatures (and for them to be witnessed). Mrs Frazer forged her husband's signature (without his knowledge) and persuaded the solicitors' own law clerk to falsely witness the forged signature of Mr Frazer. Mrs Frazer then paid off the existing mortgage on the house, leaving a certain sum of money for herself. To further complicate matters, Mrs Frazer made no repayments on the new mortgage, resulting in the Radomski's selling the farm in the following year for ¬£5,000 at a mortgagee sale to Mr Walker, who was totally unaware of the defect in the title to the farm (as were the Radomskis). On 29 November 1962, Mr Walker was duly registered as the new legal owner of the farm on the property title. After the farm was sold however, Mr Frazer refused to recognise Mr Walker's claim to legal ownership to the farm, leaving Mr Walker having to file an action for possession of the farm with the courts. == Held == Mr Walker's claim was upheld by both the High Court and the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. The Frazers appealed his claim to ownership to the farm to the Privy Council, where the earlier decisions were upheld. The Privy Council ruled that while the legal interest in the land may have been originally obtained by fraud, because Mr Walker was unaware of any fraud at the time of purchase (a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, under section 183 of the Land Transfer Act), meant that he had indefeasible title to the farm. In a wider sense, this case is important due to its affirmation of the immediate nature of indefeasible title under section 62 of the Land Transfer Act 1952, following Boyd v Mayor of Wellington. == References == * Gerbic & Lawrence, \\"Understanding Commercial Law\\", LexisNexis, 2003 ==External links== *Link to full text of case Category:1966 in New Zealand law Category:Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from New Zealand Category:1966 in case law Category:Property law of New Zealand ","title":"Frazer v Walker"},{"id":"35346634","text":"Hen. Mariano Noriel Centennial Park, Maharlika Hi-way Baloc, Santo Domingo, Nueva Ecija Playground . Mariano Noriel (c. 1864 - January 27, 1915) was a Filipino general who fought during the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine-American War. He was member of the War Council that handled the case of Andres Bonifacio in 1897. He led Filipino advance troops before the American army landed in Intramuros in 1898. ==Early life and career== A native of Bacoor, Cavite, General Mariano Noriel was born in 1864. There is no available information about the exact date and place of his birth, nor about his parents, education, and other personal data. Noriel was the president of the Council of War that tried the Bonifacio brothers (Andres and Procopio) in Naik and later in Maragondon in May 1897. Convicted of sedition and treason, Andres and Procopio were sentenced to death but Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the newly established Revolutionary Government, commuted the death verdict to banishment to the Pico de Loro Mountain in Maragondon. The commutation, however, was later withdrawn due to strong pressure from senior army officers and prominent citizens, including General Pio del Pilar and Gen. Noriel himself who believed that the two brothers, if allowed to live, would endanger the Revolution. The withdrawal of the commutation order was construed by Noriel, who was also in charge of the prisoners, as a go signal for the execution of the sentence, and so he had the two brothers shot to death a squad of soldiers under Major Lazaro Macapagal on Mount Nagpatong (not Mount Buntis as reported in history books), Maragondon, May 10, 1897. Aguinaldo, in the book A Second Look at America, which he co-authored with Vicente Albano Pacis but later disauthorized, claims that his withdrawal of the commutation order did not mean immediate implementation of the death verdict. He says he wanted a little more time for a cooling-off period so that eventually the Bonifacio brothers would be forgiven and pardoned. This is in accord with Aguinaldo‚Äôs well-known humanist and compassionate character. However, this continues to be a controversial point in Philippine history.Emilio Aguinaldo, Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan, Copyright by Cristina Aguinaldo Suntay, Manila, 1964Emilio Aguinaldo and Vicente Albano Pacis, A Second Look at America, New York, 1957 ==Life after the Philippine Revolution== History has a way of putting a strange twist to the life story of Noriel. The records show that the doughty Bacoor general, along with the two others, was sentenced to death for the murder of a man in the Bacoor cockpit in May 1909. The Court of First Instance decision on the case was later confirmed by the Philippine Supreme Court, so it was appealed by an Irish-American lawyer named Amzi B. Kelly, to the Supreme Court of the United States which subsequently reversed the decision. But before the final verdict was received from Washington, Noriel and his co-accused had already been executed by hanging in Manila on January 27, 1915.E.

The castle was originally built in the early 14th century, and extended in the 15th century to form a substantial fortification. Parliamentary troops attacked the castle twice during the English Civil War, burning it. It was later restored to form a country house. ==Details== Robert de Tilliol built Scaleby Castle after 1307, next to the village of Scaleby, from Carlisle.Pettifer, p.47. The Tilliols were a well-established family in the region from the reign of Henry I onwards, and Robert was given the land for the castle by Edward I and granted the authority to build a castle by Edward II.Taylor, p.344. The initial castle comprised two sets of buildings, linked by a small courtyard and protected by a curtain wall on both sides, surrounded by a large, circular, water-filled moat approximately wide, and an inner moat, since largely destroyed.Pettifer, p.47; Scaleby Castle, National Monuments Record, accessed 5 April 2012. The male Tilliol line died out in 1435; the castle then passed by marriage to the Colville family.Taylor, p.344. They rebuilt much of the castle in the late 15th century, including remodelling the pele tower, the great hall and the gateway, complete with a polygonal barbican.Pettifer, p.47. The pele tower formed a substantial fortification, about by across, with three floors and thick walls.Taylor, p.345. The Musgrave family acquired the castle and Sir Edward Musgrave rebuilt the south range of the castle in 1596.Taylor, p.344; Pettifer, p.47. In 1641, the English Civil War broke out between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and Parliament. Sir Edward's grandson, another Sir Edward Musgrave, was a strong Royalist supporter and declared for the king.Mackenzie, p.331. In February 1645, Parliamentary forces besieging nearby Carlisle also besieged and eventually seized Scaleby Castle, causing considerable damage; Edward recovered the castle, but in at the start of the Second English Civil War in 1648 he again took up arms on behalf of the king.Mackenzie, p.331. This time the castle immediately fell to Parliamentary forces, who set fire to it.Mackenzie, p.331. Sir Edward was heavily in debt so he sold the castle after the war to Richard Gilpin, who restored the property .Mackenzie, p.332. The property remained in the hand of the Gilpins until it fell into disrepair; it was restored once again by Rowland Fawcett. In 1847 James Fawcett was resident there.Mackenzie, p.332; Taylor, p.344. Today the castle is a grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.Scaleby Castle, National Monuments Record, accessed 5 April 2012.

He was a part of the Mission to Tibet financed by the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide, which still supervises the missionary activity of the Catholic Church throughout the world. Friar Marco appears to have lived and worked in Tibet, Nepal, and northern India, viz., Bihar and Bengal. He is credited for writing several essays and letters describing his experiences of Indian society and customs for the benefit of future missionaries, notably in two autobiographical essays: Diversi sistemi della religione dell'Indostano and Osservazioni sopra le relazioni che fa Monsieur Holwell Ingles; several translations of Indian religious texts from Hindi to Italian; and 55 pieces of correspondence between himself and Cardinal Stefano Borgia, Secretary of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide. This friar was literally unknown or unheard of until his life and works were described by journals and articles published by Cambridge University Press and others, based on a research project in 1998 by David Lorenzen, an author who used Marco's surviving letters in the Vatican Library and the Vatican Secret Archives of the Propaganda Fide to write a personal and intellectual biography of him from Marco's own view. Lorenzen used the texts of Marco's surviving letters and essayswith material from various works to fill in the gaps. He thus wrote the friar's life, attributing to Marco words that he never wrote or spoke, in order to \\"construct\\" a \\"historical text\\". ==Life== He was born Pietro Girolamo Agresti in 1726 to Crisostomo Agresti and Vittoria Luzietti in the village of Tomba, near the town of Senigallia, then part of the Province of Urbino in the Papal States, now in the Province of Ancona. There existed a Capuchin friary in his town, and he was clearly inspired by the lives of the friars to enter their Order. He was received into the novitiate of the Capuchin friars in Camerino on 25 April 1745 and given his religious name of Marco. He professed solemn vows as a member of the Order one year later. Volunteering for the foreign missions, he was sent to serve the Tibet Mission which had been entrusted to the members of his Capuchin ecclesiastical province by the Propaganda Fide. After departing Italy, Marco arrived in Chandernagore in the region of Bengal on 8 October 1757. What Marco found was a small Capuchin community struggling to cope with the devastation caused by the conquest of the French fort by British forces. At the order of the head of the prelature, he left for Bihar on 29 January of the following year, where he took up the post of military chaplain for the French forces commanded by Jean Law in Bettiah. Marco spent much of his time in Patna, Chuhari, and in the mission station in Bettiah - near the Nepal border and more or less, directly south of Kathmandu. During this time, he recorded and commented on the number of events of the late eighteenth century as essays, letters, and translations, including religious texts, beliefs, and practices in India. He was ordered by his superiors to return to Italy in 1773, where he remained until 1783. During this time he made a number of requests either to be sent back to India or to Brazil, as he knew Portuguese. Marco was sent back to India in 1783 and lived mostly in Bettiah, Patna, Chandernagore, and Bhagalpur. He died in Bhagalpur on 13 March (or 7 June) 1803 at an age of 77. ==Writings== During his stay in Northern India, Marco wrote a great number of essays and letters, which still survive in the Vatican library and the archives of the Propaganda Fide. Marco nowhere mentioned the overview of the mission and his own life. Based on the archives of the Capuchin Order, by the time he arrived in Chandernagore on 8 October 1757, the English had transported most of the French men to outside the city, after a war between French and English in March of that year; a large number of English workers were employed to demolish the fort and factories belonging to the French company. His accounts also describe several historical events such as a plague in the city of Chandernagore after its conquest by the British; his departure to Bettiah and Patna; accounts such as English were in war against the people of the country, both Hindu and Muslim; and the banishment of the Jesuits from Chandernagore. In 1766 Marco wrote an essay in Italian entitled Diversi sistemi della religione dell'Indostano referring to the people of the country as Gentili, but never using the term \\"Hindu\\"; instead, he contrasts their religion with that of both the Christians and Muslims. He divides the \\"diverse tribes of men\\" as that are believed to originate from the body of Brahma‚Äîthe tribes of Brahmins and cows; the Vaishnavas (Bisnuas); the Ramanandis; the Saivas; the Smartas ( Asmaetr) of Sankaracarya, the Nastikas or atheists, the Pasandas or hedonists(according to Marco), and the Saktas. He further subdivides religious practitioners of these sects or groups, according to their style of observance into Yogis, Vanaprasthas, Sannyasis, Nagas, Vairagis, and Avadhutas. Marco distinguishes the Kabir Panthis (Cabiristi) and the Sikhs (Nanekpanti) as two groups somewhat separate from other eight groups. In his discussion of the Sikhs, he tried to show that Sikhs had staked out a religious position combining elements of both the Hindu and Muslim faiths, based on a Hindi phrase: In 1771 he wrote an essay in Italian language entitled Piccola descrizione dell'India orientale, o Industan (A short description of East India, or Hindustan) in which he described his Indian experiences for the benefit of future missionaries. After Marco returned to Italy in 1773, sometime between 1774 and 1783, he edited some of his earlier essays to refine them, and wrote an essay Osservazioni sopra le relazioni che fa Monsieur Holwell Ingles (Observations on the Accounts of the English Lord Holwell) and a long polemical essay against Holwell's views on Hinduism. During his stay in Italy, he also drew up a plan for the future of the Tibet mission, which had already been expelled from Tibet in 1745. No writings by him are known from after his return to India. ==Legacy== In general, Marco's essays, letters, and translations of Indian religious texts into Italian appears in his accounts of his experiences and explorations in India. Among them is the translation of a part of Tulsidas's Ram-carit-manas(Ramcharitmanas) and an essay entitled Libri Indiani(Indian Books), which contain the discussions of the four Vedas, eighteen Puranas, different philosophical darsanas, more in line with the standard model of Hinduism. ==References * Europeans in late Mughal south Asia: The perceptions of Italian missionaries * The Scourge Of The Mission: Marco della Tomba in Hindustan * MARCO DALLA TOMBA Y LA MISI√ìN DE TIBET * ORIENTALIST MUSEUM - ROMAN MISSIONARY COLLECTIONS AND PRINTS(EIGHTEENTH CENTURY) Category:1726 births Category:1803 deaths Category:People from Ancona Category:Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:18th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Italian Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Capuchin missionaries in India Category:Italian male writers Category:Translators from Hindi Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Nepal Category:Capuchin missionaries in Tibet Category:Italian expatriates in India ","title":"Marco della Tomba"},{"id":"35346761","text":"The 2000 New Zealand Grand Prix event for open wheel racing cars was held at Pukekohe Park Raceway near Auckland on 2 December 2000.

The magnet consists of two sections, one of \\"hard\\" (high coercivity) magnetic material and one of \\"soft\\" (low coercivity) material. The direction of magnetization in the latter piece can be switched by a pulse of current in a wire winding about the former. When the magnetically soft and hard materials have opposing magnetizations, the magnet produces no net external field across its poles, while when their direction of magnetization is aligned the magnet produces an external magnetic field. Before the electropermanent magnet was invented, applications needing a controllable magnetic field required electromagnets, which consume large amounts of power when operating. Electropermanent magnets require no power source to maintain the magnetic field. Electropermanent magnets made with powerful rare-earth magnets are used as industrial lifting (tractive) magnets to lift heavy ferrous metal objects; when the object reaches its destination the magnet can be switched off, releasing the object. Programmable magnets are also being researched as a means of creating self- building structures. ==Description== An electropermanent magnet is a special configuration of magnetic materials where the external magnetic field can be turned on and off by applying a current pulse. The EPM is based on a common magnetic configuration called magnetic latch (right picture). A general example of this configuration assembly is built by a permanent magnet block with two plates of soft magnetic materials (generally iron alloys) on each side of the block. Those two plates exceed the dimensions of the permanent magnet. Because the plates had a higher permeability than the air, they will concentrate the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet. When a third (external) soft magnet plate is placed touching the other two plates, the magnetic flux will flow confined in the soft magnetic plates creating a closed magnetic circuit and the magnetic field produced by the magnet will be maximum (approximately the magnet remanence). An EPM has at least two permanent magnets in between the plates. The magnetic field generated by the EPM is produced by the permanent magnets not by electric currents and this is the main difference with the electromagnets. An EPM uses only a pulse of current to magnetize one of the magnet in a desired direction (turning on and off the external magnetic field of the latch). After changing the direction of the magnet no current is needed and the field will return to depends on the permanent magnets. ==Electropermanent magnet principle== In order to explain the principle of the EPM, the configuration on the following picture is presented. Two permanent magnets are assembled with two U-shape (horseshoe) iron bars. If the north pole of both magnets are pointing up we will have the configuration described on the left: The iron U in the top will see two norths on its ends and will concentrate the flux lines but it won't be able to contain the magnetic flux and the flux will flow through the air and will try to find the other iron U. In a general schema, the iron U on top will become a north pole of the big magnet and the bottom iron U will become a south pole. In this configuration we can say there is big magnet ON. Representation of a magnetic latch configuration that can turn the external magnetic field ON and OFF by rotating one of the magnets. If we rotate one of the hard magnets (north pole point down), the iron U on top will see a north pole and a south pole. The other iron U will see exactly the opposite. In this way almost all the magnetic flux will be concentrated inside both iron U's creating a close circuit for the magnetic field (because the high permeability of the iron). Having all the flux confined inside the structure, the magnetic flux outside became almost nonexistent. In this configuration we can say the big magnet is OFF. Now we can move forward and instead of mechanically rotating one of the magnets we can flip the direction of its magnetization. To do it we can build the configuration on the following picture: EPM principle. Representation of a magnetic latch configuration where the external magnetic field can be turned ON and OFF by reversing the magnetization direction of one of the magnets by action of the current in the coil. A coil is wound around one of the magnets in a way that if we inject enough current (in a pulse) in the solenoid the generated magnetic field inside will be higher than the intrinsic coercivity of the magnet ( H_{ci} ). If this is the case the permanent magnet will be magnetized in the direction of the field inside the solenoid. Applying the same pulse of current in the opposite direction will lead to magnetize the magnet in the opposite direction. Therefore, we have the same behavior as when we mechanically rotate the magnet. This configuration is the concept of electropermanent magnet: Using a pulse of current we reverse the magnetization direction of one of the magnets and we will turn ON and OFF the external magnetic field. It is important to mention that both magnets can be wound in the same coil, but it is necessary that one of the magnets have much lower intrinsic coercivity than the other in order to flip their magnetization direction without changing the other's direction of magnetization. During this explanation we use one magnet made of NdFeB and the other made of AlNiCo because both materials had the same remanence (around 1.3T) but AlNiCo has a lower intrinsic coercivity of 50kA/m while NdFeB has an intrinsic coercivity of 1120kA/m. ==Magnetic circuit analysis== Using a magnetic circuit analysis we can represent a simple EPM using the following schematic: Detailed and simplified schematic of the EPM's magnetic circuit. We present two permanent magnets made of different materials (AlNiCo and NdFeB) and the soft magnet is made of Hiperco.Ementor. \\"https://www.emetor.com/edit/materials/hiperco-50-035mm/?cat=6&co;=15, (2015). An additional segment of hiperco is shown to close the circuit and obtains better calculated results. An air gap is included (One for each side of the EPM) for calculating the magnetic flux and field generated in the air as function of the gap distance. This will lead to obtain an expression of the EPM's force (exerted over the additional segment of hiperco) as a function of the separation distance. Design concept of an EPM. For the calculation of the values of the components in the circuit we will assume that all the areas in the flow have the same dimensions. If the selected magnets had a cylindrical shape then the area of the flow for the magnets will be A = \\\\pi \\\\sdot r^2 and the hiperco blocks will have a square section of side s = r \\\\sdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} in order to have the same area. For the AlNiCo magnet we can calculate the magnetomotive force (MMF), the reluctance \\\\mathcal{R} and the magnetic flow over that magnet as: : MMF_{AlNiCo} = H_{C-AlNiCo} \\\\sdot L_{AlNiCo} : \\\\mathcal{R}_{AlNiCo} = \\\\frac{L_{AlNiCo}}{\\\\frac{ B_{r-AlNiCo}}{H_{C-AlNiCo}} \\\\sdot A} : \\\\Phi_{AlNiCo} = \\\\frac{MMF_{AlNiCo}}{\\\\mathcal{R}_{AlNiCo}} For the NdFeB magnet we can calculate the magnetomotive force (MMF), the reluctance \\\\mathcal{R} and the magnetic flow over that magnet in the same way: : MMF_{NdFeB} = H_{C-NdFeB} \\\\sdot L_{NdFeB} : \\\\mathcal{R}_{NdFeB} = \\\\frac{L_{NdFeB}}{\\\\frac{ B_{r-NdFeB}}{H_{C-NdFeB}} \\\\sdot A} : \\\\Phi_{NdFeB} = \\\\frac{MMF_{NdFeB}}{\\\\mathcal{R}_{NdFeB}} Expressions for the reluctance \\\\mathcal{R} of the gap and the hiperco can be also generated: : \\\\mathcal{R}_{gap} = \\\\frac{L_{gap}}{\\\\mu_{0} \\\\sdot A} : \\\\mathcal{R}_{hiperco} = \\\\frac{L_{hiperco}}{\\\\mu_{r-hiperco} \\\\sdot A} But the magnetic circuit can be simplified by using electric source transformations and considering all the hiperco in only one big reluctance (mainly because the value of those small pieces of reluctance are negligible compared with the reluctance of the permanent magnets). A simplified version of the magnetic circuit was presented on the right in the picture above: An equivalent reluctance ( \\\\mathcal{R}_{equivalent}) can be calculated to replace the magnets: : \\\\mathcal{R}_{equivalent} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathcal{R}_{NdFeB}} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathcal{R}_{AlNiCo}} \\\\right )^{-1} For the equivalent MMF, there are going to be two different values. One when the EPM is ON and both flows are in the same direction (addition): EPM ON: : \\\\color{green} MMF_{equivalent} =\\\\mathcal{R}_{equivalent} \\\\sdot \\\\left (\\\\Phi_{NdFeB}+\\\\Phi_{AlNiCo} \\\\right ) And another one when the EPM is OFF and the magnetic fluxes are in opposite direction (subtraction) EPM OFF: : \\\\color{red} MMF_{equivalent} =\\\\mathcal{R}_{equivalent} \\\\sdot \\\\left (\\\\Phi_{NdFeB}-\\\\Phi_{AlNiCo} \\\\right ) Knowing the value of the MMF for the two stages of the EPM and the equivalent components, we can continue calculating the magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density (B): : \\\\Phi_{gap} = \\\\frac{MMF_{equivalent}}{2 \\\\sdot \\\\mathcal{R}_{gap} + \\\\mathcal{R}_{hiperco} + \\\\mathcal{R}_{equivalent}} : \\\\mathbf{B}_{gap} = \\\\frac{\\\\Phi_{gap}}{A} The original formula for force between two magnetized surfaces without fringing is well known, and presented below. In the formula the force is divided by 2. Since we are going to calculate the force for the two areas corresponding to the gaps then the equation to calculate the force as a function of the gap distance looks like: : \\\\mathbf{F}_{(gap-distance)} = \\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{B}_{gap})^2 \\\\sdot A}{\\\\mu_{0}} ==EPM design== Magnetization coil fabrication Design parameters for the magnetization coil in an EPM. The first and most important step is to design the solenoid that will create the magnetic field to reverse the magnetization of the AlNiCo. As mentioned before the AlNiCo has an intrinsic coercivity of 50kA/m so it is necessary to create a field of at least: B_{apply} = \\\\mu_{0}H_{ci}=62.8mT . It is recommended to design the field 3 times higher than the intrinsic coercivity to fully magnetize a material. Picture below depicts the coil design parameters: The next step to complete the design is to calculate the B field in the middle point of the coil using the equations for thick solenoidsAxial field of a finite solenoid. \\"http://www.netdenizen.com/emagnet/solenoids/solenoidonaxis.htm, (2005). (knowing: B_{z} = \\\\mu_{0}H_{z} ): : H_{z}(0) = \\\\frac{N \\\\sdot i}{D_2-D_1} \\\\sdot ln\\\\left ( \\\\frac{D_2 +\\\\sqrt{D_1 +\\\\sqrt \\\\right ) Then, it is necessary to calculate the length of the wire and the number of turns that we are going to use in the solenoid. The equations provided by Princeton physics Princeton Physics. \\"http://physics.princeton.edu/romalis/magnetometer/coildesign/, (2015). was used so N is the number of turns and L is the wire length: : N = \\\\frac{L}{d_{wire}} \\\\sdot \\\\frac{(D_2-D_1)}{2 \\\\sdot d_{wire}} : L_{wire} = 0.515 \\\\sdot N \\\\sdot \\\\pi \\\\sdot (D_2+D_1) Using the AWG table provided by,Wire Gauge and Current Limits_EOL. \\"https://www.eol.ucar.edu/rtf/facilities/isff/LOCAL_access_only/Wire_Size.htm \\", (2015). for different wires, it is possible to create a spread sheet with the diameter of the different wires and the maximum current they can handle (Maximum amps for power transmission). To solve this problem it is necessary to fix D1, the solenoid length to L and the current to the maximum value permitted for each wire. This simplify the optimization problem leading to calculate Bz by changing D2. Using solver function in the spreadsheet, this value can be calculated. After this it is possible to include parameters for the resistance (cooper resistance in mŒ©/m multiply by the wire length), the power as P=I^2 \\\\sdot R and the voltage as V=P / I . A different value for each AWG wire gauge will be generated and the voltage and power to obtain the desired Bz at a maximum current must be calculated. By inspection it is possible to find the wire with minimal power consumption. The last step to design the coil is plot the B field inside the coil as a function of the position inside the coil. We will use the full version of the equation for thick solenoids and making z variate between -L/2 and L/2: : H_{z}(Z) = \\\\frac{N \\\\sdot i}{2L \\\\sdot (D_2-D_1)} \\\\sdot \\\\left [ (L+2z) \\\\sdot ln \\\\left ( \\\\frac{D_2 +\\\\sqrt{D_1 +\\\\sqrt \\\\right )+(L-2z) \\\\sdot ln \\\\left ( \\\\frac{D_2 +\\\\sqrt{D_1 +\\\\sqrt \\\\right ) \\\\right ] Magnetic force calculations Using the formula for force mentioned earlier it is possible to plot the force as a function of the gap distance of the external hiperco bar. Two curves were obtained: one for the EPM in ON state and the other for the EPM in OFF state: If we plot those forces together it is possible to observe the difference of at least 4 orders of magnitude from the EPM when is ON and OFF (This plot is an example of EPM with two cylindrical magnets -one NdFeB and the other AlNiCo- of 1mm diameter and length. The soft magnet material is hiperco with square section bars of side 0.889mm to make the flux area equal to the one in the magnets): Plot of the forces between the EPM and the external bar as a function of the gap distance between them. For EPM ON and OFF. Multiphysics simulations An example of an EPM of 300 \\\\mu m by 400 \\\\mu m is simulation to verify the difference in the magnetic field when the EPM is ON and OFF. This simulation was made using finite element approach by the software COMSOL Multiphysics¬Æ. The picture below shows a simulation of the Magnetic Flux density Field (B) for the EPM ON and OFF (with a calculation of the flux in that specific plane) and below shows multiple cross section measurements of the flux density on top of the EPM (ON and OFF as well).

Bathysuchus displays features that suggest it was more pelagic than other teleosaurids (along with its close relative Aeolodon), including smoother skull bones and reduced armour plating, similar to the fully marine metriorhynchids. This was possibly an adaptation to rising sea levels during the Kimmeridgian, as its earlier relatives such as Teleosaurus were suited for shallow coasts and lagoon environments. ==Description== Assigned tooth Bathysuchus is a very long-snouted (longirostrine) teleosaurid, currently known only from several snouts, the back of the skull, teeth, and a few osteoderms. It is distinguished from other derived teleosaurids in the following characteristics: strongly ventrally deflected anterior margin of the premaxilla; five premaxillary alveoli, the caudal-most being considerably reduced in size; anterodorsally oriented external nares; conical teeth bearing carinae which are only visible on the apical third of the crown. Other salient diagnostic characters can be found in the tooth count, shape of external nares (which is roughly '8'-shaped) and strong deflection of the premaxilla down and outwards. The osteoderms of Bathysuchus are unlike those of other teleosaurids. Teleosaurid osteoderms are typically heavily ornamented with irregular or tear-drop shaped pits radiating in a starburst pattern, while those of Bathysuchus have small circular pits arranged in alternating rows (shared with Aeolodon). All but the single caudal osteoderm also lack keels. The osteoderms are also generally smaller and thinner than typical of teleosaurids. ==Discovery== Bathysuchus was originally described as a new species of Teleosaurus, T. megarhinus, by John Whitaker Hulke in 1871 on the basis of NHMUK PV OR 43086, an incomplete snout from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Kimmeridge Bay in Dorset, England.Hulke, J. W., 1871, Note on a Fragment of a Teleosaurian snout from Kimmeridige Bay, Dorset: Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, v. 17, p. 442-443. In his 1888 catalog of extinct reptiles and amphibians preserved in the Natural History Museum, Richard Lydekker referred it to Steneosaurus, as S. megarhinus.Lydekker, R. (1888).

Containing the Orders Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Squamata, Rhynchocephalia, and Proterosauria. British Museum (Natural History):London, 1-309. Delair (1958) did not accept the attribution of T. megarhinus to Steneosaurus,J. B. Delair. 1958. The Mesozoic reptiles of Dorset. Part one.

J. 2005. Phylogenetic relationships of the Thalattosuchia. Zitteliana A45: 211-213. A preliminary report from 2015 indicated that \\"Steneosaurus\\" megarhinus is distinct from all other Middle-Late Jurassic teleosaurids and deserved its own genus.Foffa D, Young MT, Brusatte SL, Steel L. (2015) New specimen and revision of the late Jurassic teleosaurid 'Steneosaurus‚Äô megarhinus. PeerJ PrePrints 3:e1351v1 https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1351v1 This study was followed up in 2019 by a re-description of all the specimens attributed to the species, which were assigned to a new distinct genus, Bathysuchus megarhinus. The generic name Bathysuchus comes from the Ancient Greek Œ≤Œ±Œ∏œçœÇ (bathus) for 'deep' and tœÉo·ø¶œáŒøœÇ (so√ªkhos) for 'crocodile', with the intended translation of \\"deep water crocodile\\", referring to its inferred lifestyle. Three specimens are known for Bathysuchus: the holotype, NHMUK PV OR 43086, and DORCM G..5067i-v are both incomplete snouts from Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset, part of the deep water Kimmeridge Clay Formation. An additional skull from the slightly older Aulacostephanus eudoxus Sub-Boreal ammonite Zone of ‚ÄúLa Crouzette‚Äù, Francoul√®s, is known from Quercy, France. ==Classification== Bathysuchus has consistently been recognised as a teleosauroid thalattosuchian, although its affinities to Teleosaurus and Steneosaurus were only based on superficial features of the skull. The anatomical distinctiveness of Bathysuchus was recognised in 2019 by Foffa and colleagues through a thorough re-description of the known specimens. This also allowed them to include it in an updated phylogenetic analysis of thalattosuchians incorporating the newly recognised traits. Their analysis found Teleosauroidea to be split into two major groups, one containing Teleosaurus and other generally long-snouted genera that they referred to as 'clade T', and another of Steneosaurus edwardsi, the durophagous Machimosaurini, and their closest relatives that they called 'clade S'. Bathysuchus was found to be a member of 'clade T' most closely related to Aeolodon and then Mycterosuchus. Their results are shown simplified below: Assigned osteoderms ==Palaeobiology== Stratigraphic and palaeogeographic distribution of Bathysuchus. Bathysuchus was identified as sharing several characteristics with Aeolodon and metriorhynchids that suggest it was more pelagic than other teleosaurids. Anatomically, Bathysuchus shares with them the reduced ornamentation of the skull, as well as smaller, less sculpted osteoderms. It is unknown if it also had proportionately smaller limb bones, as known from its close relative Aeolodon. The reduction of the osteoderms in size and complexity is suggested to be related to thermoregulation, as the vascularised osteoderms of crocodylomorphs are thought to radiate heat into the body. In pelagic marine reptiles basking is not as necessary as the ambient water temperatures fluctuate less, and a similar shift may have occurred in the lineage leading to Bathysuchus and its relative Aeolodon that allowed them to reduce their osteoderm coverage. The presence of Bathysuchus fossils in the Kimmeridge Clay is also significant, as this represents a deep water environment on the outer shelf with depths estimated to be around 150‚Äî200 metres, and was associated with deep water fauna including large pliosaurs, geosaurine metriorhynchids and ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaurs. This environment was part of the Jurassic Sub- Boreal Seaway, which was noted to show a decline in teleosaurid diversity across the Middle‚ÄîLate Jurassic boundary as global sea levels rose.

His military career spanned from World War I to the Korean War before retiring a lieutenant general in 1956. He was also a former mayor of Hinesville, a timber baron, and one of the first resort developers of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, which his son, Charles E. Fraser, developed into Sea Pines Plantation. ==Early years== Fraser was born to the Honorable Joseph Bacon Fraser, Sr. and Maria Boulineau Fraser on July 15, 1895. He was preceded by brother Charles W, born October 29, 1886, Sister Mary B., born August 31, 1888, Donald A, born January 10, 1890, Addie W, born October 30, 1891, and Harry B, born September 4, 1893. He had one younger brother, Thomas Layton, born March 16, 1899. His father was a mayor of Hinesville in 1913 and 1915, a stockholder in the Hinesville Bank, a director in the Flemington, Hinesville & Western Railroad, and an owner of considerable real estate. Joseph B Fraser completed his preparatory studies at Napier Edinburgh in Hinesville. Afterwards, Fraser entered into the University of Georgia at Athens, where he played football, but did not letter, and was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. ==Military career== World War I When World War I broke out, Joseph Bacon Fraser and his brother, Donald A. Fraser, enlisted as privates in the U.S. Army. Joseph was commissioned a second lieutenant in July, 1918 and promoted to first lieutenant in March 1919. He was released from federal service in May 1919, but continued his record of military activity in the National Guard. In September 1920, he was commissioned captain of Troop B. Georgia Cavalry where he served under Harry Truman. He was promoted to major in September 1927, and to lieutenant colonel in January, 1935. Becoming a full colonel in June 1936, he was placed in command of the 108th Cavalry. 108th Cavalry Regiment Insignia World War II Pacific Theater =Journey to Australia= Fraser was ordered to federal active duty as a colonel and sent to Australia in February 1941. He left Boston aboard the RMS Queen Mary, the largest passenger ship at the time, with 10,000 other men and overloaded equipment. Chaplain Lt. Clarence Letson was one of Fraser's Hinesville companions also on board the ship. Leston wrote in his diary that the ship sailed first to Key West, Florida, then to Rio de Janeiro. They spent two days there, blockaded by an axis submarine but escaped over a shallow bar at high tide. \\"A zigzag course was then taken to Capetown, South Africa, during which the ship caught fire three times ‚Äî all caused, the captain felt, because of the overload on the wiring. They entered the Tasmanian Sea and stopped in Perth, Australia, then disembarked at Sydney and caught trains up through the interior to Brisbane. The following day, Gen. MacArthur arrived.\\" With Fraser and Lt. Letson were men from Georgia and South Carolina; they composed the major portion of the 101st Separate Coast Artillery Battalion (Anti-Aircraft) which Fraser commanded in the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps Pacific Theater of Operations from 1942 to 1943. The rest of the 10,000 men aboard the Queen Mary were dispersed throughout the Pacific. Years later, when addressing a group honoring Fraser for his safe return to Hinesville, he said, \\"When I left Camp Stewart in February 1942, I requested the men under my command to be made up of Georgia men. A number of the men came from Liberty and Long counties. They were among the best in the country and I am indeed grateful in the manner in which they met the enemy on the battlefront and conducted themselves during the perilous trip overseas.\\" =Defense of New Guinea= After receiving General MacArthur's Orders in Sydney, Fraser and the 101st Battalion were the first American combat ground troops to go into New Guinea during the New Guinea Campaign in 1942. With the Japanese rapidly overtaking New Guinea and MacArthur's forces regrouping in Australia, MacArthur told Fraser that they would have little chances of surviving but to hold off Japanese forces as long as they could. A diary entry by Lt. Lester on March 30, 1942, shortly before the battalion sailed to New Guinea reads, \\"This is it. The Japanese are moving in toward New Guinea.... Into combat. We‚Äôve been preparing but didn‚Äôt really believe it would happen. ‚Ä¶ We can‚Äôt believe that we‚Äôre playing for keeps. Col. Joe Fraser and I met and prayed to God last night for guidance and leadership to carry our men through the battles before them. He was crying; his men were going to die. All are willing to go, but what a sinking feeling.\\" (Col. Fraser later told a group in Hinesville that he prayed another hour in his headquarters before leaving for the Jap-infested area). The battalion sailed unmolested through enemy waters, where they landed safely and fought off repeated air attacks by Japanese Zeros with 50-caliber machine guns over the next few months until the rest of MacArthur's forces returned. Fraser made his gunners frequently relocate the anti-aircraft gun locations so that the Zeros had a hard time determining where to focus each new attack. The 101st played a role in holding what allied territory remained on New Guinea until the Battle of Coral Sea thwarted the Japanese 5-pronged plan of attack on Australia. Colonel Fraser was 'mentioned in despatches' in Canberra, Australia, on January 13, 1944. (England), 1944. Colonel Joseph B. Fraser (seated, center) and other military and political figures during wartime . European Theater Ordered to the European theater in February 1944, he commanded the 23rd anti-aircraft group there. On August 19‚Äì21, the 23rd AAA group protected the XV corps of General Patton's Third Army in making the first allied bridge crossing of the Seine River near Paris. Over two days, the 23rd shot down 43 Axis aircraft. Fraser was again released from federal service in December 1945. He returned to duty with the Georgia National Guard, and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on February 3, 1947, and placed in command of the 108th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Georgia National Guard, with headquarters at Savannah, Georgia.http://libertyhistory.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=273:fraser- joseph-bacon-jr&catid;=105:all&Itemid;=65 Korean War Called back into federal service in August, 1950, Fraser was promoted to the rank of major general and commanded the 48th Infantry Division, composed of Georgia and Florida National Guard units. Retirement He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general when he retired from the Georgia National Guard on August 1, 1956. ==Business career== Fraser was president of the Fraser Lumber Company since 1929, and president of the Fraser Supply company since its organization in 1956. We he left for World War II, his son Joe Jr. ran the lumber company. Much of the timber operation at the time was based on cutting naturally seeded forests, rather than forest replanting operation in common practice today. In 1949, in efforts to seek out new properties to timber, he joined a group of lumber associates to buy a total of 20,000 acres of pine forest on Hilton Head Island's southern end for an average of nearly $60 an acre. Gen. Joseph B. Fraser, Fred C. Hack, Olin T. McIntosh, and C.C. Stebbins formed the Hilton Head Company to handle the timber operation. In 1956, Fraser youngest son, Charles E., who had recently graduated from Yale law, bought his father interest in the Hilton Head Company and created the Sea Pines Company. Fraser served as the chairman of the board for the company. ==Personal life== Robert Groover, author of Sweet Land of Liberty: a History of Liberty County, Georgia, writes, \\"No one person did more to promote the general welfare of his fellow citizens in Liberty County from 1930 to 1940 than did Joseph B. Fraser Jr. During the worst economic depression America had ever known, he worked tirelessly in the Liberty County Chamber of Commerce and with various state and federal programs to help alleviate the suffering of the people of Liberty County.\\" Fraser was very active in the Presbyterian Church. He was a communicant of the First Presbyterian Church of Hinesville, where he served as an elder. He was a member of the board of World Missions, Presbyterian Church of the United States, and is past president of the Assembly's Men's Council of the national church organization. In 1949, Fraser served as the chairman of the board of trustees for Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina. Fraser, like his father, served as Mayor of Hinesville in 1932.http://libertyhistory.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=318:independence- day-1932&catid;=68:1930-1940&Itemid;=101 He took an active interest in the program of the Boy Scouts of America and was a member of the national council and vice president of region six. He was the council president from 1948 to 1949 prior to his service in the Korean War. In 1980, a donation was made in memoriam Joseph B Fraser to the Boy Scouts that enabled them to build the Coastal Empire Council Headquarters in Savannah, Georgia. His memberships included the Lions Club of Hinesville, of which he was a charter member; the Oglethorpe Club of Savannah; and the Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons. In Masonry, he was a member of the higher bodies of the Scottish Rite. At Cobbtown Georgia, on November 14, 1923, Joseph B. Fraser married Pearl Collins, daughter of Elbert and Margaret Elizabeth (Davis) Collins. Mr. and Mrs. Fraser had two children, both of whom were born in Hinesville. Joseph Bacon, Jr., born January 27, 1926, and Charles Elbert, born June 13, 1929. General Fraser was himself born a junior, but dropped it when his father died and subsequently gave his oldest son the Junior suffix. ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1971 deaths Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Businesspeople in timber Category:American military personnel of World War I Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army generals Category:American Presbyterians ","title":"Joseph Bacon Fraser"},{"id":"35347107","text":"Michael Ball is the debut album by English singer Michael Ball.

Promine functions as an extension of AutoDesk's AutoCAD software, providing additional functionality specifically oriented for work in the mining industry. Promine uses the native 3-Dimensional aspect of CAD software to enable users to produce functional models of working, planned or past mines. Though focused on development of underground mines, Promine also supports above ground (open pit) mining as well as strictly geological work. ==History== Promine was founded as Yvan Dionne Inc, by the company's founder and President Yvan Dionne over twenty years ago in Quebec, Canada. The incorporation was warranted due to the large number of functions he had developed on contract which together made a de facto software suite. After deciding on the company name, Promine, the company was reincorporated as Promine Inc. The company today stands at approximately 10 employees and has two separate branches, the Montreal office specializing in Marketing, sales and business development and the Quebec City office specializing in software development. A model created using example data in Promine ==Areas of operation== Promine is available in English, French and Spanish, natively. The evolution of supported languages has followed the evolution of the company's client base. Promine was founded in Quebec, Canada, where the official language is French, and so too was the first language of the software. As clients from other Canadian provinces got the software, the need for an English version was satisfied. Finally, after much expansion into Canada and the United States the company began to make inroads into Latin America, eventually providing full Spanish translations. The company has clients in French-speaking Africa and several consultants in Europe use the software as well. ==References== * http://metals- mining.cioreview.com/vendor/2015/promine * http://www.energy- executive.com/features/contributing-writers/205-the-new-era-of-mining Category:Software companies of Canada Category:Science software for Windows Category:Geology software ","title":"Promine"},{"id":"35347161","text":"Nicholas Hofgren is a London-based financier and fund placement advisor.

The high Alpine, limestone massifs of the Hochschwab, Veitsch, Schneealpe, Rax and Schneeberg belong to it as do the limestone prealps to the north as far as the Flysch zone. The geological conditions in the limestone mountains make this part of the Limestone Alps a valuable drinking water reservoir, from which the Vienna Water Supply (Wiener Wasserversorgung) draws. The geologist, Eduard Suess, pressed the Vienna city council for a water supply from this region as early as 1864. In 1873 the First Vienna Mountain Spring Pipeline (I. Wiener Hochquellenwasserleitung) was opened, running from the Rax-Schneeberg area. The 2nd pipeline was opened in 1910 and also drew its water from the area of the Styrian-Lower Austrian Limestone Alps, being fed from sources in the Hochschwab region near Wildalpen. The largest spring is the Kl√§fferquelle at the foot of the Hochschwab, in Styrian Salza valley. This spring supplies 860 million litres per day during the thaw, four times more than can be transported to Vienna through the pipeline. The Vienna Forestry Commission looks after the forests in the catchment area of the sources, which is a designated water protection area. Parts of the forest also belong to Admont Abbey.

Originally married in Austria in 1955, they later moved to New Zealand in 1956. In that same year they purchased their matrimonial house at 62 Wallace Street, Wellington for the sum of $3,900, with the wife paying half the deposit of $1,000. However, despite her paying half the deposit, only the husband was listed on the property title as the registered owner. However, this still gave her an equitable ownership to the property. In 1958 the couple briefly separated, and the husband agreed to a settlement agreement in which he acknowledged he owed his wife half the deposit for the house. The couple soon reconciled. In 1968 the wife lent the husband $1,000 for a trip back to Austria for what has been described as an indefinite stay. In his absence, the wife took in a boarder, only referred to as \\"K\\". When the husband finally returned to his wife unexpectedly on 20 April, he discovered that his wife and the boarder \\"K\\" were living together in a marriage-like relationship. In the ensuing argument, the wife walked out of the house, taking their two children with her. The following day, 21 April, the wife obtained, and had served on her husband, an interim injunction prohibiting him from returning to the house. Not happy with these developments, on the following day 22 April, the husband showed the injunction to a Mr Petrovic, a real estate agent, and instructed him to sell the house, and the agent arranged a sale of the house for $5,000, substantially below its valuation of $8,000, the same day, with the settlement date being only three days later on 25 April. Even then, the purchaser settled the sale the following day, on 23 April, which was legally two days early than required, and the title transfer was done first thing the following day at 9.30am on 24 April. Mrs Glantschnig was then forced to file a motion for the purchase to be set aside, and also added her ex-husband and the real estate agent Mr Petrovic, who was aware of the scheme to defraud, to the proceedings. The purchaser, Mr Efstratiou claimed he had indefeasible title. == Held == The Court of Appeal of New Zealand ruled that due to amongst other things, the great speed of the sale (less than 24 hours after listing), that it was sold for only 63% of the market price, and the transaction was stamped and registered the very day after settlement, that the purchaser was aware of the wife's equitable interest in the property (albeit unregistered) and that the sale was registered through fraud, that accordingly, the purchaser did not have indefeasible title and the sale was set aside. However the court vacated the wife's previous award of damages for $3,000 and awarded her legal costs of only $300. == References == * Gerbic & Lawrence, \\"Understanding Commercial Law\\", LexisNexis, 2003 * [1972] NZLR 594 Category:Court of Appeal of New Zealand cases Category:1972 in New Zealand law Category:1972 in case law Category:New Zealand contract case law ","title":"Efstratiou v Glantschnig"},{"id":"35347326","text":"Margarita Escarpa is a Spanish classical guitarist.

He is a bowling allrounder. He is a right-arm medium-fast bowler and a robust left-handed lower-order batsman. Hasan has played Tests, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals for the Bangladesh national team. In his first Test, against the West Indies in Khulna in November 2012, he became only the fourth player to make a century batting at number 10, and the second to do so on debut - the first being Australia's Reggie Duff in 1902. Hasan made 113 from 123 balls, and added 184 for the ninth wicket with Mahmudullah, who made 76. By coincidence, he conceded 113 runs when bowling in the West Indies' first innings. Domestically, Hasan plays for Sylhet Division, though he played for Duronto Rajshahi during the second season of the Bangladesh Premier League in 2013. In February 2018, Hasan and Taibur Rahman scored 136 runs for the eighth wicket for Kala Bagan Krira Chakra against Khelaghar Samaj Kallyan Samity in the 2017‚Äì18 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League. Before the partnership, Kala Bagan Krira Chakra were 34 for 7 in the eleventh over of the match.

The overall plot deals with the friendship between a human boy called Anton and R√ºdiger, a vampire boy. The basic idea dates back to 1976, when Sommer- Bodenburg wrote short stories about the adventures of the little vampire and a human boy, finally collecting them and forming the series' plot from them. ==Synopsis== Protagonist Anton Bohnsack, an ordinary 9-year-old boy, is fascinated by vampires until befriending one (called R√ºdiger) of a vampire clan, the Schlottersteins, who reside in the local cemetery. Little by little, Anton befriends R√ºdiger‚Äôs younger sister Anna and older brother Lumpi. Anton undertakes frequent nightly ‚Äútrips‚Äù with R√ºdiger and Anna, wherein Anton must hide his presence (and his friendship with R√ºdiger) from hostile vampires, his own parents, and the fanatic Geiermeier, the cemetery's caretaker. ==Characters== Main characters ; Anton Bohnsack Anton is 9 years old and attends the 3rd grade. He likes reading horror stories, especially vampire stories like those written by Sheridan Le Fanu or Hugh Walpole. After becoming involved in the world of vampires, he goes to great lengths to assist both his new friends, R√ºdiger and Anna, and their family (who are not fully aware of Anton's friendship with R√ºdiger) against potential dangers, including his own parents and especially Geiermeier. ; R√ºdiger von Schlotterstein R√ºdiger is the second youngest of the Schlotterstein clan, and was turned into a vampire when he was 11. Though mostly only interested in his own benefit, he never abandons his friends. He shows the vampires' world to Anton and meets him as often as possible. He has a lot of respect for his older brother Lumpi and tries to emulate him. There are typical siblings troubles between him and his sister Anna. ;Anna von Schlotterstein Anna is the youngest of the Schlotterstein children and was turned into a vampire at the age of 9. Shortly after R√ºdiger met Anton, he introduces Anna to his human friend, starting a close friendship between the two. In fact, both Anna and Anton develop a crush on each other, but their respective natures as human and vampire pose an impenetrable barrier for a more serious relationship. Initially, Anna was known as \\"Anna die Zahnlose\\" (\\"Anna the Toothless\\") because she didn't want to become a true vampire and drank milk as a substitute nourishment, though later on she gives in to her true nature, although her affection for Anton still remains strong. In the end of the series, she is appointed the successor of the German vampire leader, Elisabeth die Naschhafte. Schlotterstein vampires ;Lumpi der Starke (Lumpi the Strong) R√ºdiger and Anna's older brother, and the self-proclaimed strongman of his family. He is very moody and temperamental, due to his becoming a vampire while still in puberty. Although he occasionally threatens and intimidates Anton, he is generally on good terms with him and keeps his and his sibling's friendship with the human confidential from the adult von Schlottersteins. ;Aunt Dorothee von Schlotterstein-Seifenschwein R√ºdiger and Anna's aunt, and while reputedly the most bloodthirsty and relentless of the Schlotterstein vampires, she does seem to look out for the children more than the other adults. Nevertheless, with her Anton has had several close calls. Ever since losing her husband Theodor to Geiermeier, she has been on the prowl for a new mate, and though for a while she is attracted to the phony vampire Ingo von Rant, she later switches her affections to Mr. Schwanenhals, the instructor of Anton's dance class and, coupled with his willingness to become a vampire, marries him in the last volume. ;Uncle Theodor von Seifenschwein R√ºdiger and Anna's uncle. Long before the series begins, he was caught playing cards on his tombstone by Geiermeier, who subsequently killed him. This event forced the Schlottersteins into moving their coffins into a subterranean crypt beneath the cemetery. Theodor's coffin remains in the crypt, as a cover for a secret emergency exit, and his vampire cloak is lent to Anton by Rudiger and Anna on a regular basis for his nocturnal vampire adventures. ;Sabine die Schreckliche (Sabine the Terrible) The matriarch of the Schlotterstein family, and R√ºdiger, Anna and Lumpi's grandmother. ;Wilhelm der W√ºste (William the Rakish) Sabine's husband, and R√ºdiger and Anna's grandfather. ;Ludwig der F√ºrchterliche (Ludwig the Horrible) and Hildegard die Durstige (Hildegard the Thirsty) These two vampires are the son and daughter-in-law of Sabine die Schreckliche and therefore R√ºdiger, Anna and Lumpi's parents. Ludwig is very devoted to his wife, but she is a vain and selfish creature who usually ignores her children. Humans ;Anton's Parents Robert Anton Bohnsack, a jokester and shipping company worker, and his wife Helga, a rather temperamental schoolteacher, are perhaps Anton's greatest obstacles in his new life with the vampires. Initially they do not believe that Anton's new friends (R√ºdiger and Anna) are vampires, although they find the latters' mode of dress rather peculiar. However, after an incident in which Anna was inadvertently photographed but did not appear in the picture, they both begin to take the matter a bit more seriously, even if they still do not fully believe in the existence of vampires. Like his son Anton, Mr. Bohnsack was named after his own father (and Anton's grandfather). ;Hans-Heinrich Geiermeier The keeper of the local old cemetery and the self-declared nemesis of the Schlotterstein vampires. After encountering Uncle Theodor by chance and killing him, Geiermeier has been waging his private war with the vampires ever since, a conflict in which Anton often has to interfere for the benefit of his friends. His anti-vampire habits include garlic as part of his regular diet, and an armament of wooden stakes carried on his nighttime patrols. ;Wolf-R√ºdiger Schnuppermaul A gardener hailing from Stuttgart who was hired as Geiermeier's assistant for hunting down vampires. Unlike Geiermeier, Schnuppermaul is somewhat dimwitted, less obsessive and has an extreme cleanliness quirk, making him a comic relief figure contrasting his partner and employer. He unwittingly becomes friends with Lumpi, and even after discovering the latter's true nature, they retain their friendship at the end of the series. ;Dr. J√ºrgen Schwartenfeger Schwartenfeger is a psychologist. He first appears when Anton's parent decide to send their son to him to cure him of his fascination of vampires, but it turns out that Schwartenfeger has actually developed a program to help vampires in overcoming their aversion to sunlight, which he believes to be a psychological condition rather than a physiological one. R√ºdiger eventually becomes one of his patients. ;Igno von Rant Von Rant makes his first appearance as a patient for Schwartenfeger's vampire desensibilization program. Although he appears as a vampire, von Rant (whose name is a wordgame for \\"ignorant\\") is actually a university professor named August Piepenschnurz who is in cahoots with Geiermeier. He woos Aunt Dorothee and tries to win the trust of the Schlotterstein children, but his masquerade is exposed thanks to Anton's efforts. Other vampires ;Olga, Fr√§ulein von Seifenschwein The cousin of R√ºdiger and Anna from their uncle's side. A spoiled, manipulative and highly arrogant girl, she fled from Transylvania to Germany when her family was destroyed by a band of vampire hunters, seeking sanctuary with her aunt's family. She quickly becomes the romantic interest for R√ºdiger, but she expresses more interest in Anton instead. Only after she bites Anton and drinks his blood to make him her slave in the series' last volume does R√ºdiger finally overcome his infatuation and break up with her for Anton's sake. ;Count Dracula The legendary vampire has several appearances in the series as the overlord of the world's vampires. He eventually becomes a teacher for the Schlotterstein children, but he ultimately fails in his task. ;Elisabeth die Naschhafte (Elisabeth the Sweet-Toothed) The leader of the German fraction of the world's vampires. At the end of the series, she chooses Anna von Schlotterstein to be her successor. ;J√∂rg der Aufbrausende (J√∂rg the Irascible) and Waldi der B√∂sartige (Waldi the Malignant) Two youngs vampires who are Lumpi's best friends and members of his Vampire Men's Club and Vampire Men's Music Association, regularly organizing bowling tournaments or nail treatment competitions. == English editions == # My Friend the Vampire (also The Little Vampire) # The Little Vampire Moves In # The Little Vampire Takes a Trip # The Little Vampire on the Farm # The Vampire in Love # The Little Vampire In Danger # The Little Vampire in the Vale of Doom # The Little Vampire in Despair # The Little Vampire and the Mystery Patient # The Little Vampire in the Lion's Den # The Little Vampire Learns to Be Brave # The Little Vampire Gets a Surprise # The Little Vampire and the Wicked Plot # The Little Vampire And The School Trip # The Little Vampire And The Christmas Surprise # The Little Vampire Meets Count Dracula ==Reception== Der kleine Vampir has proved quite successful both domestically and internationally.

The film stars Kay Francis (on loan from Paramount), Paul Cavanagh (on loan from Fox), and Ricardo Cortez, and deals with the romantic entanglements of a wealthy English businessman, his wife and a Spanish nobleman. The film is remake of a 1924 silent film named after the novel, which stars Dorothy Mackaill and Lon Chaney, as well as having Cortez in the same role as this film. Produced and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures, it was premiered in New York City on June 12, 1931, with a national release two weeks later on June 27. ==Plot== Required to travel to India for a year to oversee financial matters, English businessman Robert Maury (Paul Cavanagh) is in a quandary regarding his young wife. His older sister, Honora (Nance O'Neil), suggest that he leave her at their country estate, where she can keep an eye on her. But his wife, Elsie (Kay Francis), is fearful of the boredom which may set in if she were to remain on the isolated property. Maury gives in to his wife's fears, and decides to allow her to move to Paris for the duration of his time on the sub-continent. In Paris, she falls under the guidance of the sophisticated Paula Vrain (Doris Lloyd), who begins to teach her how to fit into the decadent Parisian lifestyle. She quickly assimilates to her surroundings, and begins to attract attention from the men in her social sphere. One in particular, a Spanish nobleman named Don Arturo de Borgus (Ricardo Cortez), begins to pay her special attention. Elsie struggles to keep the relationship platonic, and as her husband's year-long absence draws to a close, she decides that the temptation has become too great. With Maury's return imminent, Elsie is convinced to attend one last party by Paula, who unbeknownst to Elsie is working on Don Arturo's behalf. At the party the Spanish nobleman gives Elsie's seduction one last-ditch attempt. And it is beginning to work. Arturo invites Elsie to spend the weekend at his estate in Spain. She is considering the offer when Maury shows up unexpectedly. He is dismayed by the changes in his wife. He had left an innocent behind, and now he has come back to a sophisticated, jaded woman. His dismay, coupled with their year-long separation, causes him to act cool towards her. It is this coolness which makes up her mind. When Maury requests that she return to England with him the next day, she defers, saying she wants to stay behind to say goodbye to the friends she has made while in Paris. After Maury leaves for England, she heads to Arturo's. Once there, Arturo begins an all-assault to sexually seduce her. In this, he is abetted by his servant, Serafin (John St. Polis). As she weakens, before she will fully succumb, her conscious makes her write a letter to her husband in England, confessing everything. She gives the letter to Serafin to post for her, and is about to fully give in to Arturo, when a local peasant, Carlos (Agostino Borgato), appears and accuses Arturo of seducing and impregnating his young daughter, who died during childbirth. Furious, Carlos shoots and kills Arturo. Horrified at her almost tragic mistake, she realizes that she must intercept her confession before Maury has an opportunity to read it. Serafin claims that he has already written it, so Elsie determines to return to the English estate and intercept it there. Back in England, she waits day by day to head off the postman. Her furtive actions arouse the suspicions of Honora. When she discovers a news article regarding Arturo's death, those suspicions are heightened, believing that Elsie might have been the unnamed woman mentioned in that article. When she accuses Elsie of infidelity in front of Maury, he defends his wife, leading to Honora deciding to finally leave the estate. It is shortly after that Serafina arrives, threatening to reveal Elsie and Arturo's relationship to Maury, and claiming that he is carrying the confessional letter. Realizing that she loves her husband, she refuses to help in the plan to hurt him. When Serafin confronts Maury with the lurid details, he is disappointed, for Maury refuses to be outraged. Chastened, Serafin departs, and Maury accepts his wife back into his loving arms. ==Cast== (Cast list as per AFI database) * Kay Francis as Elsie Maury * Paul Cavanagh as Robert Maury * Ricardo Cortez as Don Arturo de Borgus * Nance O'Neil as Honora \\"Nora\\" Maury (*in the silent film The Next Corner this is possibly the same character played by Louise Dresser as Nina Race, mother of Elsie.

During production, the film was known by the name of the earlier picture, as well as Around the Corner, but in early June, the final name was announced as Transgression. The new name was selected as a result of a pool among the publicity men employed by RKO. William LeBaron chose Herbert Brenon to helm the picture, and he began working on the project in early February 1931. Elizabeth Meehan was assigned to adapt Kate Jordan's novel for the screen in early March, which was originally slated to be a starring vehicle for Irene Dunne. That changed in April when RKO announced that they had borrowed Kay Francis from Paramount to star in the picture; in the same statement, Don Alvarado was also mentioned as a member of the cast, although he was replaced prior to filming. In mid-April it was announced that Paul Cavanagh, Doris Lloyd, and Ruth Weston had been added to the production. The cast would go through several incarnations before being finalized. In addition to Alvardo and Dunne, among those who were attached to the project at various times were: Alphonse DeCruz, Esther Crispin Martini, Wilfred Roy, David Dunbar, and William Welch. By the end of April it was decided that Leo Tover would be the film's cinematographer, re-uniting him with Brenon for the first time in four years. Brenon had directed three of the first five films Tover had photographed, the last being 1927's The Telephone Girl. The two had collaborated on the first film version of the famous F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, The Great Gatsby. RKO premiered the film in New York city on June 12, 1931. It was released nationally later in the month on June 27. French version RKO produced a French version of the film titled Nuit d'Espagne, which was directed by Henri de la Falaise. It was announced in April that he would be directing the version, which would be the third French variation he did for RKO. He selected Jeanne Heibling and Geymond Vital to play the Francis and Cavanaugh roles, respectively. The only actor to appear in both films was actress Adrienne D'Ambricourt, in a small role. The film went into production in early May 1931. ==Critical response== Motion Picture Daily did not enjoy the film. While they complimented the acting corps on their performances, and Brenon on his directing, they felt the script was completely inadequate, stating, \\"Herbert Brenon's direction is satisfactory and had he had something to work with the picture might have had a chance\\". The Film Daily likewise had a lukewarm opinion of the film, also praising the acting and directing, but finding the overall story \\"punchless\\". They called the film a \\"highly sophisticated drama\\", but complained that it contained \\"... little comedy relief and a wealth of talk, but particularly no action.\\" Screenland did not like the story, but also enjoyed the acting. The most comprehensive and complimentary review of the film came from Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times. He gave good marks to Brenon's direction, calling it a mostly \\"intelligently filmed story\\", stating that Brenon had managed in \\"eliciting the spectator's interest\\", and that the photography had \\"some compelling atmospheric effects in some of the sequences.\\" He did have some reservations about the overall film, however, stating that \\"It is not endowed with any great degree of subtlety and the comings and goings of the characters are set forth a trifle too abruptly.\\" Hall also felt the acting was done well, giving particular praise to Paul Cavanaugh and Nance O'Neil, although he felt that Ricardo Cortez could have given a stronger performance. ==References* Category:1931 drama films Category:1931 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Adultery in films Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Herbert Brenon Category:American multilingual films Category:American film remakes Category:Sound film remakes of silent films Category:American drama films Category:1931 multilingual films ","title":"Transgression (1931 film)"},{"id":"35347422","text":"Petrus Kiers, from Schilders van Drenthe (artist not credited) Candlelight Scene in the Boudoir (1841) Petrus Kiers (5 January 1807, \\"Het Groeneveld\\", near Meppel ‚Äì 17 November 1875, Amsterdam) was a Dutch painter, graphic artist and photographer.

It was one of the most celebrated river crossings of the whole war, wherein American forces crossed the Marilao River, which was wide and too deep to ford, while under Filipino fire from the opposite bank. ==Background== After the failed Filipino counterattack to regain Manila on February 23, General Antonio Luna, the Chief of War Operations of the Philippine Republic, resigned his post on February 28 in protest to the reinstatement of the Kawit Battalion, which Luna had disarmed for insubordination during the earlier fighting around Caloocan. During Luna's absence, President Emilio Aguinaldo himself took over the military affairs, for the only time in the whole course of the war. Meanwhile, the Americans, anticipating another counteroffensive from the Filipino side, took their time waiting for reinforcements under General Henry Ware Lawton. These arrived between March 10 and 23. By March 25, the Americans under General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. renewed their offensive against Caloocan and Polo, up to the ultimate drive to Malolos. ==Battle== The American force, after the Battle of Malinta, had advanced to Marilao on March 27. It was part of the campaign for the Capture of Malolos, the Philippine capital. The Filipino force was led by President Emilio Aguinaldo himself, commanding the organized forces of General Isidro Torres, General Pantaleon Garcia (who just came straight from Dagupan with a thousand riflemen) and Colonel Enrique Pacheco. The Americans fought with the Filipinos within the range of around . Meanwhile, the Filipinos destroyed bridges to delay American artillery units. The Americans gained superiority in the battle only after severe fighting and the use of gunboats in the river that \\"made great execution\\" of Filipino soldiers. The official American account of the battle stated that Aguinaldo acted with a great sense of military strategy, averting a disastrous rout while succeeding in inflicting heavy damage on the Americans. The losses in the American drive to Malolos, the account also stated, had proven the Filipinos' effective fighting ability. ==Aftermath== On the American side, the American official history stated that 14 were killed and 65 more wounded. In the account of Teodoro Agoncillo, the battle resulted to 15 killed and 70 wounded. The Filipino side had sustained 90 dead. After resting at Guiguinto, Bulacan from March 29 to 30, 1899, the American division under General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. pushed to the suburbs of Malolos by the afternoon of March 30. Malolos fell the next day, on March 31, since the Americans faced only token resistance. The American forces would rest in Malolos until April 1899, when they would have to shatter the Calumpit-Apalit Line at the Battle of Quingua and Battle of Calumpit. ==References== Marilao River Marilao River Category:1899 in the Philippines Category:History of Bulacan Category:March 1899 events ","title":"Battle of Marilao River"},{"id":"35347515","text":"Chilton Avenue‚ÄìOrchard Parkway Historic District is a national historic district in Niagara Falls in Niagara County, New York.

The team now operates as England Under-21s. Its primary role was the development of players in preparation for the senior England women's national football team. As long as they were eligible, players could play for England at any level, making it possible to play for the U23s, senior side, and again for the U23s, as Natasha Dowie, Rachel Williams and Danielle Buet have done recently. In 2005 Casey Stoney played for the team in the Nordic Cup, despite already having 30 caps at senior level. It is also possible to play for one country at youth level and another at senior level (providing the player is eligible). Helen Lander and Kylie Davies decided to play for Wales at senior level after playing for England U23s, while Sophie Perry elected to play for Ireland. ==History== Beginnings In February 1987 the Women's Football Association (WFA) appointed Liz Deighan to run a women's national under-21 team. Deighan had been a star midfielder in the England team which reached the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football. Four years later Deighan was not re- appointed and John Bilton took over. The team folded shortly afterwards because the WFA had run out of money. Eight of England's squad at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup had come through Deighan's U-21 team, including Pauline Cope, Karen Burke and Louise Waller. FA sanctioned team In summer 2004, The Football Association (FA) decided to reconstitute the U-21 team in order to give women a higher level of play to better prepare them for the full national team. Senior team manager Hope Powell held a four-day camp in Shropshire and announced: \\"This is a major step forward for our international teams and will bridge the gap between Under-19 and Senior levels. We have been observing players in this age bracket for the last six months and with the clubs' assistance I believe we can make this a real success.\\" Powell installed her full-time assistant with the senior team, Brent Hills, as coach of the team, which remained an U-21 selection from 2004 through 2008. Competing as an U-23 team 2008 saw the change of England's youth national women's team moved to the U-23 level. The move was made by the FA in response to age-level changes FIFA had made to its oldest women's youth competition, now named FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The age limit was raised from being a U-19 tournament to a U-20 tournament. This adjustment, coupled with a newly introduced U-23 age limit to the Nordic Cup, prompted the FA to rethink and eventually change the youth development team. The team continues to serve as a stepping-stone for players to the England women's national team. Brent Hills explained that it had become more of a challenge to break into the senior team: \\"When I started, if you were an extremely talented 18-year-old you may have been able to get into the senior team. I'll give you an example, Fara Williams. You would have to be the next Kelly Smith now to be able to do that.\\" England U23s did not have a permanent home. When England hosted a tournament in 2010, the event was held at University of Warwick where it was possible to attend and watch without a ticket. Because of the smaller demand compared to the senior women's national team, much smaller grounds could be used. The team's last competitive tournament was the 2012 Four Nations Tournament, in which England finished third. They also competed in a variety of competitions, including the annual Nordic Cup, which was previously the top competition for this age group.http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_12189697.html  Move to U-21 system  In a bid to better aid the transition between the youth pathway and senior football, the FA announced in September 2018 that they were scrapping the U23s and U20s levels in order to form an Under-21s age group, which would become the top tier of the nation's professional development phase. The move would align England's structure to that used in other European countries to allow for more age-appropriate games and better manage individual player development post-U20 World Cup for those who have genuine senior team potential. The then U20s manager Mo Marley was announced as head coach. ==Current players== 2017 Nordic Tournament roster The U-23 women will compete in the Nordic Tournament in Norway against the U-23 teams of Sweden, United States and Norway from 6 to 12 June 2017. ==Coaches== * Liz Deighan (1987-1992) * Brent Hills (2004-2013) * Marieanne Spacey (2013-present) ==ReferencesBibliography== * Under-23 Category:Youth football in England Category:European national under-23 association football teams Category:Women's national under-23 association football teams ","title":"England women's national under-23 football team"},{"id":"35347539","text":"Over the past 150 years, anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists and libertarian socialists have held many congresses, conferences and international meetings in which trade unions, other groups and individuals have participated. == The First International == The original International Workingmen's Association (IWMA), often known today as the First International, grouped together workers' societies of various socialist tendencies, including Mutualists, Blanquists, Owenites and republicans, though the most prominent were undoubtedly the Collectivists, grouped around Mikhail Bakunin and the Communists, led by Karl Marx. Towards the end of the First International, the Collectivists adopted Communist positions, but differed from the Marxists in their absolute rejection of authority, both within the International and in their strategic vision for the social revolution, which must immediately abolish the State and not, as with the Marxists, use it in order to gradually establish a communist society. In these early years of the international socialist movement, the IWMA held 5 congresses attended by both these latter tendencies, at which the differences between the various ideologies clearly emerged. After the 5th Congress, the movement split, with the anarchist communists establishing an anti-authoritarian International. The IWMA was dissolved after its 6th Congress.  Conferences and Congresses of the IWMA  * Preliminary Conference in London (United Kingdom), 25‚Äì29 September 1865. Preparation for the 1st Congress. * 1st Congress of Geneva (Switzerland), 3‚Äì8 September 1866. * 2nd Congress of Lausanne (Switzerland), 2‚Äì8 September 1867. * 3rd Congress of Brussels (Belgium), September 1868. * 4th Congress of Basel (Switzerland), September 1869. * Conference of London (United Kingdom), 7‚Äì23 September 1871. Called as a result of the impossibility of holding the annual Congress because of the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune in 1870 and 1871. * 5th Congress of The Hague (Netherlands), 2‚Äì7 September 1872. * 6th Congress of Geneva (Switzerland), 8 September 1873. * International Convention of Philadelphia (USA), 15 July 1876. It was decided to disband the International. == The first anarchist congresses == After the Hague Congress (1872), which saw the expulsion of the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume, it was decided to hold a Congress of the anti-authoritarian Sections and Federations of the International in St. Imier, Switzerland. The Congress was attended by delegates of the International federations in Italy, Spain, Belgium, the United States, France and French-speaking Switzerland. It should be remembered that many sections of the International around this time had membership figures running into the thousands and tens of thousands. This congress was not considered by the anarchists as the first of a new international organization, but rather the continuation of the old International. It rejected the modifications to the General Rules of the IWMA that had been decided at the London Conference (1871) and the Hague Congress (1872).  Congresses of the Anti-authoritarian IWMA  *International Congress of St. Imier (Switzerland), 15‚Äì16 September 1872. * (6th) Congress of Neuch√¢tel (Switzerland), 27 September 1873. Abolition of the General Council and autonomy of federations. * (7th) Congress of Brussels (Belgium), 7‚Äì12 September 1874. * (8th) Congress of Bern (Switzerland), 26‚Äì29 October 1876. * (9th) Congress of Verviers (Belgium), 6‚Äì8 September 1877. After 1877, the anti-authoritarian International continued to function in certain areas (such as Spain, Tuscany and Switzerland) on a local level. A number of local or regional congresses were held, including an important congress of the Jura Federation (Switzerland) in September 1880 which was attended by a number of international delegates and observers. It was at this congress that the anarchist movement adopted anarchist communism as its goal.  Other Anarchist congresses until 1922  * International Anarchist Congress of London, 14‚Äì20 July 1881. * International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam, 26‚Äì31 August 1907. There were various other unsuccessful attempts to call international congresses, in Geneva (1882), Paris (1889), Chicago (1890) and again Paris (1900). A number of anarchists also attended the World Socialist Congress, which took place in Ghent (Belgium) from 9‚Äì15 September 1877. The Second International was set up in 1889, and many anarchists participated in it. Although they were expelled from the 3rd Congress, the 4th Congress in London in 1896 saw a continuation of the clash between libertarian and authoritarian socialism, with a number of anarchists, such as Malatesta and Cornelissen, in attendance. == The rebirth of the IWA == Following the First World War and the Russian Revolution, anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists once again sought to rebuild the IWA. Initially intending to join with other revolutionary syndicalist organizations in the Bolshevik-led Profintern, libertarian unions became increasingly worried about the authoritarianism of the Bolsheviks and the subordination of Profintern to the Comintern. So, after two conferences in Berlin, the first from 16‚Äì21 December 1920 and the second from 16‚Äì18 June 1922, the new International Workingmen's Association (later to be known as the International Workers' Association) was born at its first congress in December 1922. The IWA still exists today.

The objective was often the same: to create an international organization which would group together the various non-syndicalist anarchist organizations, i.e. those that were not already members of the IWA. A stable international organization was finally established in 1968 at a congress in Carrara, Italy - the International of Anarchist Federations (IFA), which still exists today.

Later the same month, he was named in the squad for the Rangpur Riders team, following the draft for the 2018‚Äì19 Bangladesh Premier League. He was the leading wicket-taker for Mohammedan Sporting Club in the 2018‚Äì19 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League tournament, with 22 dismissals in 16 matches. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Sylhet Thunder in the 2019‚Äì20 Bangladesh Premier League. ==International career== An off spinner in Bangladesh cricket is a rarity, but a cricketer turning up from Patuakhali, one of the southernmost districts of Barisal, has made a mark with that brand of bowling. Sohag Gazi is the rare specialist offspinner who grew up right by the Bay of Bengal, and has travelled the length and breadth of the country to be recognised as one of the promising slow bowlers in Bangladesh. His run-up is short, even by spinners' standards, but his bowling action itself is a whir, followed by a tight follow-through. The call-up to the National Cricket Academy and the Bangladesh A team followed. He did well in the West Indies for the A team and against other second-string sides but he faced a few dark months in 2012 when an umpire at the Shafi Darashah tournament in Bangalore reported him for a kink in his elbow while bowling the quicker delivery. He went through the usual checks before being given the green signal to play first-class cricket in the 2012-13 season, one which he started off with nine wickets. A seven-wicket haul in the second innings included a hat-trick, and spectacularly, Sohag slammed a hundred in the same game, becoming only the thirteenth cricketer of all time to score a century and take a hat-trick in a first-class match. He was soon picked up for the Bangladesh team for the first Test against West Indies in November 2012. Having been called up to play against the West Indies in November 2012, he bowled the first ball of the first test in Mirpur. The ball was hit for six by Chris Gayle, the first time this had been achieved in the history of the game, although he finished the innings having bowled 47 overs with figures of three for 145. His spell of 4 for 29 against West Indies at Khulna was nominated to be one of the best ODI bowling performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo.http://www.espncricinfo.com/awards2012/content/story/599154.html In the first Test against New Zealand in October 2013, Gazi scored his maiden test century, remaining unbeaten on 101 as Bangladesh hit 501 in reply to New Zealand's 469. He followed this up with a hat-trick in New Zealand's innings, dismissing Corey Anderson, BJ Watling and Doug Bracewell in consecutive deliveries to become the first person in history to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.\\"New Zealand tour of Bangladesh, 1st Test\\". ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 13 October 2013.

His work seeks to understand consciousness as a biological phenomenon. He is one of a small number of philosophers running their own laboratories. Currently, Revonsuo is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Sk√∂vde in Sweden and of psychology at the University of Turku in Finland. His work focuses on altered states of consciousness in general and dreaming in particular. He is best known for his Threat Simulation Theory, which ‚Äì in the tradition of evolutionary psychology ‚Äì states that dreams serve the biological function of rehearsing possibly threatening situations in order to aid survival, and his advocacy of the dreaming brain as a model of consciousness. == Biography == Revonsuo completed his graduate education at the University of Turku, receiving his master's degree in Psychology in 1990, a Licentiate in Philosophy in 1991, and finally a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1995. Since 2003, he is a member of the Academy of Finland. == Works == Revonsuo has himself written two books laying out his philosophical and scientific approach to consciousness: Inner Presence: Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon (2006) and Consciousness: The Science of Subjectivity (2010). In addition, Revonsuo has co-edited two books on consciousness: Consciousness in Philosophy and Cognitive Neuroscience (1994) and Beyond Dissociations: Interaction Between Dissociated Implicit and Explicit Processing (2000). He is also the European Editor of the journal Consciousness and Cognition.  Dreaming as a model of consciousness  According to Revonsuo, the dreaming brain is particularly suitable model system for the study of consciousness because it generates a conscious experience while being isolated from both sensory input and motor output.Revonsuo, A, (2006) Inner Presence: Consciousness as a biological phenomenon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. Regarding the rival paradigm of visual awareness, Revonsuo argues that it does not allow one to distinguish between consciousness and perception. Revonsuo holds that there is a \\"'double dissociation' between consciousness and perceptual input\\". Accordingly, dreams are conscious experiences, which occur without any perceptual stimuli, and, conversely, perceptual input does not automatically engender conscious experience. In support of the independence of consciousness from perception, Revonsuo cites Stephen LaBerge's case study on a lucid dreamer performing previously agreed upon eye movements to signal to the experimenters that he had become conscious of the fact that he was dreaming. A second study that supports Revonsuo's view of dreams was conducted by Allan Rechtschaffen and Foulkes (1965).FOULKES, D, (1985) Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Analysis (Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Rrlbaum). In this study, subjects were made to sleep with their eyelids open, thus allowing the visual cortex to receive visual stimuli. Though their eyes were open, and the perceptual input was accessible, the subjects could not see the stimuli and did not report dreaming of it. It is the brain that is having the internal experience, independent of perceptual input. This internalist view of consciousness leads Revonsuo to compare both dreaming and waking consciousness with a virtual reality simulation decoupled from or only indirectly informed by a brain's external environment. Philosophically, Revonsuo's claim that dreaming is a state of consciousness at all contradicts arguments propounded by philosophers Norman MalcolmMALCOLM, N, (1956) Dreaming and skepticism. Philosophical Review, 65, pp, 14-37. and Daniel Dennett.Dennett, D.C. (1976) Are dreams experiences? Philosophical Review, 73, pp. 151-171. Malcolm argues that, if a person is in any way conscious, \\"it logically follows that he is not sound asleep\\".MALCOLM, N. (1959) Dreaming, pp. 21-25 Dennett suggested that we needed a well-confirmed, empirical theory of dreams before we could say whether dreams were like experiences or not.Dennett, D.C. (1976) Are dreams experiences? Philosophical Review, 73, pp. 170-171.  Threat Simulation Theory  Revonsuo's threat simulation theory claims that much or all of dream experience is \\"specialized in the simulation of threatening events\\", for the evolutionary purpose of rehearsing fight or flight situations to better prepare for such instances in waking life (similar to a \\"fire drill\\"). According to Revonsuo, empiricial research supports this theory by showing the recurrence of threatening situations in dreaming: of all of the emotions experienced in dreaming, \\"fear [is] the most common and anger the next most common\\".Revonsuo, Antti. \\"The reinterpretation of dreams: An evolutionary hypothesis of the function of dreaming. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, Volume 23, Issue 6, pp. 877-901, December 2000.\\" An otherwise supportive 2009 review of threat simulation theory stated that \\"The main weakness of the theory is that there is no direct evidence of the effect of dream rehearsal (or the lack of it) on performance or on survival rates across generations of ancestral humans\\", and also notes it is not clear why some threat simulations end without a reaction from the dreamer. The review finds that \\"Overall, the available new evidence and the new direct tests of the predictions of (threat simulation theory) yield strong support for the theory. A mass of evidence indicates that threat simulation is a function of dreaming, an evolved psychological adaptation selected for during the evolutionary history of our species. On current evidence, the strengths of the theory seem to outweigh its weaknesses.\\"Valli, Katja, and Antti Revonsuo. \\"The threat simulation theory in light of recent empirical evidence: a review.\\" The American Journal of Psychology (2009): 17-38. According to a 2017 study in Sleep, an analysis of the statistical content of intelligible sleep-talking found that 24 percent contained negative content, 22 percent had \\"nasty\\" language, about 10 percent contained a variation of the word \\"no\\", and 10 percent contained profanity. 2.5 percent of the intelligible words were a variation of the word \\"fuck\\", which comprised only 0.003 percent of spoken words when awake. The study authors judged the findings as being consistent with threat simulation theory. Cross-cultural surveys find that the most typical dream theme is that of being chased or attacked. Other common negative themes include falling, drowning, being lost, being trapped, being naked or otherwise inappropriately dressed in public, being accidentally injured/ill/dying, being in a human-made or natural disaster, poor performance (such as difficulty taking a test), and having trouble with transportation. Some themes are positive, such as sex, flying, or finding money, but these are less common than dreaming about threats. Revonsuo outlines six ‚Äúempirically testable‚Äù propositions (Revonsuo, 2000) to illustrate his \\"threat simulation\\" theory.  Proposition 1  Dream experience embodies an ‚Äúorganized and selective simulation of the perceptual world.‚Äù Sensory modalities are fully integrated into perceptual dream experience, and the ‚Äúactive dream self‚Äù has a body image similar to that of the waking self in the ‚Äúvisuo-spatial world.‚Äù Dreams are composed of interactions that mimic archetypical wake-state experiences and situations with people and objects. Revonsuo states that dreams are the result of an ‚Äúactive and organized process rather than a passive by-product of disorganized activation.‚Äù The predicable organization of dreams renders them as more than ‚Äúrandom noise‚Äù; rather, he views their function as a ‚Äúselective simulation of the world.‚Äù  Proposition 2  Representations of daily life experiences are absent while dreaming. Dreamers experience a ‚Äúselective simulation of the world‚Äù biased towards threatening situations. The high proportion of negative emotions experienced while dreaming correlates to the need for ‚Äúadaptive responses that increase the ability to respond appropriately in adaptively important situations‚Äù (Revonsuo, 2000). The misfortunes and aggression experienced in a dream state may act as a simulation that prepares the dreamer in the case that a similar situation may occur in the awake state. Evidence lies in the activation during REM sleep across regions that are necessary for the production of these emotionally charged experiences.  Proposition 3  Real waking life experiences that are traumatic to the individual causes the dream-production system to create dream content that simulates responses to threats as a mechanism to \\"mark situations critical for physical survival and reproductive success.\\" Revonsuo writes that \\"what from a psychological point of view is a 'traumatic experience' is, from a biological point of view, an instance of threat perception and threat-avoidance behavior.\\"  Proposition 4  The threatening dream content, while not an accurate depiction of one's real-time experience, seems incredibly realistic and is therefore effective and productive practice for threat-avoidance responses. He postulates that there is proof of this proposition in that dreamed action is consistent with real motor behavior and that \\"dreaming about an action is an identical process for cortical motor areas as actually carrying out the same action.\\"  Proposition 5  The perceptual and motor skills simulated in dreams will increase the efficiency of an individual's performance of those skills even if the dreams are not explicitly remembered. Studies have shown that the implicit learning of skills that are important for human performance can be learned and actualized without any conscious memory of having learned them. Furthermore, Revonsuo writes that \\"REM sleep physiology appears to selectively support implicit, procedural learning.\\"  Proposition 6  The threat-simulation system \\"was selected for during our evolutionary history,\\" implying that it was not innate but rather came to be in response to the multitude of threats experienced by human ancestral populations. These populations lived in a \\"more or less constant post-traumatic state\\" and the dreaming brain constructed the threat-simulation technique as an evolutionary tool, resulting in improved threat-avoidance skills and, thus, a higher probability of survival. == References == Category:Philosophers of mind Category:Cognitive scientists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Finnish neuroscientists Category:University of Sk√∂vde faculty ","title":"Antti Revonsuo"},{"id":"35347568","text":"Para√±aque National High School (abbreviated as PNHS; ) formerly known as Para√±aque Municipal High School is a secondary public school in Para√±aque and this school has the biggest population in Asia, located at Kay Talise Street and Dr. A. Santos Avenue, San Dionisio, Para√±aque. It was established in 1969. The Current Principal is Mr. Gerry A. Lumaban, Principal IV. ==History== :In 1969, what was conceived to be the first public high school in Para√±aque came to reality. Behind all these was a woman, Mrs. Lourdes M. Bernabe who was then First lady of this town. Like any mother looking after the welfare of her children, she railed with the parents of the Para√±aque youths for the equally enthusiastic people in education; Para√±aque opened a great opportunity for those below the poverty level to improve their livelihood and their social class. :Mayor Florencio B. Bernabe, Sr. rented the Nery Building in Kabihasnan to accommodate 512 youngsters, which comprised the first year high school. Many out-of-school youths found the much awaited chance to get back to school. :With only 19 teachers including those in the administration, the only public high school in Para√±aque began in operation. :Notwithstanding the many problems it met in its formative years, the school carried on. More and more enrollees came in each year, thus it sought transfer in 1973 to a new building --- its own in Sucat, Para√±aque. The building was two-storey structure located in a barren field along the stretch of rough and dusty Sucat Road. A good site, they believed. Year after year, buildings, houses, markets, theaters and rows of stores and food chains were built here-a sign that this area had promises of a good fortune and progress. Marker :PMHS owes it predecessors, a quality uniquely, tagged as a reformatory school for having accepted so called ‚Äúerring students‚Äù who had been dropped or advise forced to transfer by some other schools ‚Äì this school had graduated not just a handful of this kind. Some would even come back to visit, grateful that they had found a school which had kept them in its portals and given them the chance to find themselves during those confusing years. Not sad but happy about being dubbed reformatory ground for the wayward and those in the blacklist, the school also prides itself for having its first principal, Mrs. Angelina Samson, who herself is an institute of discipline. :In spite of the complexity of her task as principal, she ran the institution smoothly-getting together information, people energy and materials and with herself as a prime mover and co-worker, the school turned into a mechanism that operates and transforms- no one could afford to remain idle. Any flaw in the subsystem could cause the failure of the whole process. This is the discipline that has become the moving force. A genuine inspiration for the succeeding generations to remain keeping with the goals for which their school was built: Impress knowledge and discipline for work among the young and lead them to levels of self sufficiency, not to mention ‚Äì to prepare them for higher academic pursuit. :For 16 years, Mrs. Samson stayed as principal. Strong and able at the age of 65, she was a reluctant retiree. She had finally given it up through ‚Äì to her sister and the best friend in the professions, Mrs. Rosario M. Soriano. :Her commitment coupled with generosity, warmth and motherly affection, were felt by all who surrounded her. There were all sorts of problem from lack of teachers to meet the growing number of students ‚Äì to lack tools to bother about. Nevertheless, it was within that same year when she sought assistance from the Municipal OIC Rodolfo Buenavista and succeeded in seeing to the construction of additional open classrooms for the Home Economics Class. :In 1986, young, illustrious and very charming, Mrs. Rosa V. Sioson, the Third principal began as OIC. Now, as she was in the position, she courted people in the Municipality and in the Department of Education, Culture and Sports and won the graces in which the school constituents still relish until now. :Dealing with 10,000 student- population was no joke. From head of the English Department, she earned the position as OIC/Assistant Principal and then as Principal. Then, she had instant problems-from lack of teachers to salary disputes and teachers strike down to the clogged gutters, leaking roof, stinking toilets and garbage! She needed all people behind her. :Giving top priority to education among its Municipal projects, Mayor Walfrido N. Ferrer and his councilmen had approved appropriations for the construction and rental of the buildings to accommodate the increasing number of students. :PMHS metamorphosed into a more complex structure as it branched out into several annexes-La Huerta, Baclaran, San Martin de Pores and even adopting under its wings in the main- a new school- Para√±aque Science High School which is on its 4th year of operation. :The creation of PMHS annexes has paved way to division of labor, giving authority and responsibility to the right people who exemplify obedience, maintain order, equity and enhance the esprit de corps. There is centralization of functions with maintained discipline, unity of command and unity of direction. In each annex is assigned OIC/Assistant Principal ‚Äì Miss. Narcisa F. Catindig in La Huerta, Mrs. Presencia Damian in Baclaran; and Mr. Urbano Agustin in San Martin de Pores. All OIC function as immediate head. Each annex has become a subsystem with the right and essential personnel placed where he can be of best service. :It is true; one can say that behind the progress of this school is always a generous Municipal Mayor who keeps his hands open to its cry to help. The current administration of Mayor Pablo R. Olivarez is looking into the construction of an 18-room-three-storey building in PMHS. The Mayor works hand in hand with the DECS on this infrastructure which is on top of the list of Mrs. Sioson‚Äôs 24-point-project for PMHS. The Mayor who advocates reconciliation. School Quadrangle :With Mrs. Rosa V. Sioson‚Äôs retirement at the age of 65, a new lady principal came in. Ms. Estella C. Aseron, a Mathematics teacher, calculated quite well the components of success. She initiated beautification projects for school and instilled in every teacher and in every student the value of the discipline. It was in her term, where ‚ÄúAdopt-An Area‚Äù program was begun. Each Department then, adopted an area and beautified it. The school then had an imagination of nature anywhere- a sight to behold for the guest. PMHS then was renamed Para√±aque National High School (PNHS). :In August 2006, a teacher and department head who started in PMHS in early 70‚Äôs, once again stopped on the grounds of PNHS. This time he‚Äôs stationed as the PNHS new principal, Mr. Urbano E. Agustin. ==Urbano Agustin Era (2006-October 2014)== :Mr. Agustin came from Dr. Arcadio Santos National High School (the former annex of PNHS which became independent) which has been known in the entire division as a very nice school with much disciplined students. Teachers and Administration expected than that the same thing would happen with PNHS. They did not go wrong. The accomplishment of Mr. Agustin even went beyond expectations. PNHS had its ‚Äúface lift‚Äù in a matter of years. Air conditioned and newly renovated faculty rooms became Mr. Agustin‚Äôs gifts to faculty members. A number of function rooms were also noted ‚Äì speech laboratory, Science Laboratories, English Reading Center, Dance Room, Glee Club Room, Filipino Resource Center and Computer Rooms. :*In April 2012 Para√±aque Municipal/National Alumni Association was formed. :*November 20, 2012 The South Korean government funded the P20-million project Innovative ICT Classroom : ==Junior High School Programs== * Engineering and Science Education Program Science and Technology Engineering and Mathematics Program (STEM) formerly DOST * Regular Program * Open High School Program (OHSP) ==Senior High School Programs== Academic Track * Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) * Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) * General Academic Strand (GAS) * Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) Technical-Vocational Livelihood Track (TVL) * Beauty Care * Bread and Pastry Production * Cookery * Dressmaking * Food and Beverage Services * Tailoring * Wellness Massage * Hairdressing * Informations and Communications Technology (ICT) * Automotive Servicing * Motorcycle and Small Engine Repair * Electronics Products Assembly and Servicing * Electrical Installation and Maintenance ==Other Programs== * Alternative Learning System (ALS) * Special Education Program (SPED) * Special Program in the Arts (SPA) \\\\- Dance (folk dance, contemporary, hip hop) \\\\- Visual Arts \\\\- Music (choir, voice, rondalla, drum & lyre) \\\\- Creative writing \\\\- Theater Arts ==Principals== List of School Principals # Mrs. Angelita R.

The team was a member of the Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL). The Pythons joined the CIFL in 2012 as an expansion team under the name \\"Chicago Vipers\\". They changed their name to the \\"Chicago Pythons\\" four weeks into the season. The Pythons were the third indoor football team based in the Chicago area. The Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League were based in Rosemont, and the Chicago Slaughter of the Indoor Football League are based in Hoffman Estates. The Pythons replaced the Chicago Knights, formerly the Chicago Cardinals, as the Illinois-based CIFL team, which replaced the Slaughter after they left for the Indoor Football League after a dispute with CIFL management. The Owner of the Pythons was Michael Duran. The Pythons were supposed to play their home games at The Megaplex in Homer Glen, Illinois, but the team never hosted a home game. ==Franchise history== Play begins: 2012 On December 9, 2011 it was announced that the Vipers and the Evansville Rage would become the 5th and 6th expansion teams for the 2012 CIFL season. The Vipers will host only three games for the 2012 season and also have availability to host for the playoffs should they qualify. Michael Duran are looking to bring back a positive image for Chicago CIFL teams as last two have left a bad taste in the fans mouths. The team was originally scheduled to play their home games at the Odeum Expo Center in Villa Park, but later decided to play at the Sports Zone in Melrose Park. In their first ever game, the Vipers lost 52‚Äì49 to the Port Huron Patriots, who were also playing their first game. Chicago would have one last chance to tie the game, but Julie Harshbarger's kick was no-good as time expired. Before their week 5 game against the Saginaw Sting, the Vipers changed their nickname to the \\"Pythons\\" when the Mike Duran became the sole owner of the team. 2013 There was a release by the Ultimate Indoor Football League that the Pythons had joined their league for 2013, but the league late removed the story from their website and did not comment on its removal. ==Logos and uniforms== When trying to think of a nickname to call the team, Former Co-Owner Richard Petroski Jr. was texting back and forth with some family members and friends, when his cousin sent him back the name \\"Vipers\\" and it stuck. The team picked their colors while watching Oklahoma State Cowboys play. The team's original logo was introduced in December 2011 when the team announced that they would be playing in 2012. That logo featured a viper's head which merged with a football. To the right of the logo there is the words \\"Chicago Vipers\\". The team introduced a new logo in late January, 2012. The new logo removed the football, and changed the text of \\"Chicago Vipers\\" to look like that of snake skin.

The educational model stressed the significance of peer-to-peer relationships in the process of socialisation and building trust. The facilities had a set day schedule, numerous workshops and studios, planned subject-oriented classes and a team of professional educators. == Heritage == Activities of the Association were organised in Father Kazimierz Siemaszko CM Educational Institution's building on 38 D≈Çuga St. (currently 42 D≈Çuga St.), Krak√≥w, Poland. Because of spreading poverty and demoralization, he used it to establish in 1886 \\"a place of shelter and voluntary work for poor abandoned boys\\". After his death in 1904 it was renamed as Zak≈Çad Wychowawczy im. ks. Siemaszki (Father Siemaszko Educational Institution). It operated until 1954 when it was taken over by the communist authorities. The last director was Mons. Albin Ma≈Çysiak, who later became the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Krak√≥w. After almost 40 years, the building that was used as a child welfare facility until 1991, was given back to its rightful owners. After all the necessary preparations, on the 2nd of October 1993 cardinal Franciszek Macharski celebrated the opening of the new facility for schoolgirls and schoolboys in need. It was a day-care facility offering after-school educational and creative activities, psychological support, meals and group excursions. == Services == The Association was established in November 2003 in Krak√≥w and it was registered in May 2004. It received the status of a public benefit organization in September 2004. On registering the Association, the building on 42 D≈Çuga St. became its seat and underwent broad revitalisation. All workshops, offices and administration rooms were modernised. A new auditorium was added in 2008 meant for organising events, meetings and daily activities for children. The Siemacha Association focuses on operating day- care facilities, orphanages, modern sports facilities as well as counselling and therapy facilities. The Association conducts long-term public services commissioned by local authorities. It acquires funds from sponsors, uses donations from 1% of income tax and runs its own business activity. The organisation pays great attention to the quality of its services. Siemacha facilities are operating as a consistent system offering multi-dimensional support to children and their families. The Association sees opportunities in the growing demand for professional social services, the popularisation of the concept of social entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility. The organization combines a variety of facilities for children into one organism with a diversified offer. The Association is apolitical. The Association's strategic partners are the Fundacja Demos (Demos Foundation) and the PKO Bank Polski Foundation. The Association collaborates with local authorities - it performs social services and organises events, participates in promotional activities and exchange of experience. == Innovations == Collaboration with shopping mall owners results in establishing modern youth facilities located at the malls or in their vicinity. The first facility of that kind was opened in November 2010 by Gemini Park Tarn√≥w and later on in other locations: Krak√≥w, Kielce, Rzesz√≥w, Wroc≈Çaw. Since September 2014 the Association has been running an orphanage, a day-care facility, a holiday facility, sports facility and an equestrian sports centre in Odporysz√≥w nearby Tarn√≥w. On the 21st of December 2014 the President of the European Council - Donald Tusk, officially opened the Siemacha Spot in Odporysz√≥w. alt= alt= alt= == Awards == * Nagroda Organizacja Spo≈Çeczna Roku (NGO of the Year Award), Krynica 2014 * Nagroda Ma≈Çopolski Lider Przedsiƒôbiorczo≈õci Spo≈Çecznej (Lesser Poland Leader of Social Entrepreneurship Awars), Wieliczka 2011 * Cities for Children Award, Stuttgart 2010 *Nagroda Anio≈Ç Ciep≈Ça (The Angel of the Warmth Award), Tarn√≥w 2010 * Nagroda Pro Publico Bono (Pro Publico Bono Award), Krak√≥w 2006 * Nagroda Kryszta≈Çy Soli (Salt Cristals Award), Krak√≥w 2006 * Nagroda Totus (The Totus Award), Warszawa 2001 Awards listed on Siemacha Association's website. ==References== Website: http://www.siemacha.org.pl/ Category:Educational organisations based in Poland Category:Companies based in Krak√≥w ","title":"Siemacha Association"},{"id":"35347584","text":"Tasamul Haque (born 2 October 1991) is a Bangladeshi cricketer who has played first-class cricket since 2011. ==ReferencesCategory:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Bangladeshi cricketers Category:Sylhet Division cricketers Category:Chittagong Division cricketers Category:Dhaka Metropolis cricketers Category:Kala Bagan Krira Chakra cricketers Category:Bangladesh East Zone cricketers Category:Bangladesh under-19 cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Dhaka ","title":"Tasamul Haque"},{"id":"35347589","text":"The 1992‚Äì93 North West Counties Football League season was the 11th in the history of the North West Counties Football League, a football competition in England.

She previously wrestled on the independent circuit, most notably for Chaotic Wrestling (CW), where she once held the Chaotic Wrestling Women's Championship. She signed with WWE in 2012 and was assigned to the NXT brand. Her match against Bayley at NXT TakeOver: Respect on October 7, 2015, was the first women's match to ever headline a NXT TakeOver, the first Iron Woman match in WWE history, and the longest women's match in WWE history at the time with a length of 30 minutes. Their match was voted by Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) as the Match of the Year, with Banks also being voted as the Woman of the Year, while their match at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn in August 2015 won the NXT Year-End Award for Match of the Year. In 2020, she was named the top black wrestler in the world in a newly-published list entitled \\"BW 500\\", further recognized by Pro Wrestling Illustrated. She was promoted to WWE's main roster in July 2015, going on to hold the Raw Women's Championship five times. In 2016, she and Charlotte Flair became the first women to headline a WWE pay-per-view event and the first to compete in a Hell in a Cell match (both at Hell in a Cell in October 2016), the first women to main event Raw in a women's match since 2004 and the first women to win the Pro Wrestling Illustrated award for Feud of the Year. In February 2019, she won the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Championship with her former tag team partner, Bayley (then known as The Boss 'n' Hug Connection), at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view. == Early life == Mercedes Justine Kaestner-Varnado was born on January 26, 1992 in Fairfield, California, and later moved to various places, including Minnesota, to find schools and hospitals for her autistic brother. Her family settled in Boston, Massachusetts, where she began her professional wrestling career. She went to school online and grew up watching All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW). She is of African American descent on her mothers side and European German descent on her fathers side. == Professional wrestling career ==  Chaotic Wrestling (2010‚Äì2012)  Kaestner-Varnado began training at Chaotic Wrestling (CW), based in Woburn, Massachusetts, in 2008. She made her in-ring debut, under the ring name Mercedes KV, on October 1, 2010 in an intergender tag team match, where she teamed with Nikki Roxx in a losing effort to Alexxis and Danny E. KV and Roxx quickly formed an alliance, teaming together regularly and accompanying each other to ringside. On October 22, KV lost her debut singles match to Danny E., and lost a rematch to him on November 13. On January 7, 2011, KV earned her first victory when she and Roxx defeated Alexxis and Mistress Belmont in a tag team match. On February 11, KV took part in a five- woman gauntlet match to determine the inaugural Chaotic Wrestling Women's Champion, but was unsuccessful. KV continued competing in singles matches throughout the remainder of 2011 and on December 2 defeated Alexxis in a \\"I Quit\\" match to win the Chaotic Wrestling Women's Championship for the first time. KV made her first successful title defense against Barbie on January 6. KV faced Luscious Latasha with the championship on the line on January 27, where KV retained the title. KV successfully defended the championship against Alexxis in a rematch. She then successfully defended the championship twice against Nikki Roxx. On June 1, KV defeated Alexxis, Barbie and Mistress Belmont in a fatal four-way match to retain the championship, after which she became the longest reigning Chaotic Wrestling Women's Champion in history by breaking Alexxis's previous record of 182 days. KV went on to defend and successfully retain the championship against Barbie on June 24, against Aida Marie on July 20, and on August 17 against Kasey Ray. KV made her final appearance for Chaotic Wrestling on August 18, where she lost to Ivy Fit in a non-title match. On August 17, the Chaotic Wrestling Women's Championship was declared vacant after Kaestner-Varnado signed a contract with WWE, thus ending her reign at 259 days.  Independent circuit (2010‚Äì2012)  Banks as Mercedes KV in February 2012 On August 8, 2010, KV made her debut in New England Championship Wrestling (NECW), teaming with Ivy to defeat the team of Ariel and Sammi Lane. She returned to the NECW on September 4, 2011, again teaming with Ivy, defeating Mistress Belmont and Veda Scott. On September 23, KV defeated Mistress Belmont in a singles match. KV once again returned to the promotion on July 14, 2012 at the Red White and Bruised event, where she was defeated by Adrianna by countout. KV, under the ring name Miss Mercedes, debuted for National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) on November 19, 2010, where she faced Julian Starr in a losing effort. On the following two nights, Mercedes defeated Sheik Ali and Nick Fahrenheit in singles matches. Mercedes began to feud with The Great Cheyenne, losing to her on several occasions. On August 9, she wrestled her last match for the NWA, defeating Arlene in a singles match.  WWE   The BFFs (2012‚Äì2014)  In June 2012, Kaestner-Varnado participated in a WWE tryout camp and on August 18, it was announced that she had been signed to a contract. She was assigned to NXT, WWE's developmental territory, where she adopted the ring name Sasha Banks, and made her televised debut on NXT on December 12, losing to Paige. Banks' first televised win on NXT was on the January 23, 2013 episode against Alicia Fox. Banks then entered a storyline where she received letters from a secret admirer, who was eventually revealed to be Audrey Marie, who returned and attacked Banks on the February 20 episode of NXT, due to Marie's jealousy of Banks' success. Marie went on to defeat Banks in a match later that episode. Banks' feud with Marie came to an end on the April 3 episode of NXT, when Banks teamed with Paige to defeat Marie and Summer Rae. On the June 19 episode of NXT, Banks competed in the NXT Women's Championship tournament to determine the inaugural champion, but lost to Rae in the first round. After weeks of influence by Summer Rae to make herself relevant, Banks was defeated by the NXT Women's Champion Paige on the September 11 episode of NXT, after which she attacked Paige after the latter attempted to console her, leading to Banks turn into a villainess. Two weeks later on NXT, Banks defeated Bayley, while accompanied by Rae. After the match, Banks cut a promo with Rae and debuted a new gimmick as \\"The Boss\\". Banks and Rae, who dubbed themselves The Beautiful, Fierce Females (BFFs), faced Paige and Emma on the October 16 episode of NXT, where they emerged victorious. On the November 13 episode of NXT, the BFFs defeated Bayley and Charlotte in a tag team match, when Charlotte attacked Bayley and aligned herself with Banks and Rae. In mid-January 2014, as Rae moved up to WWE's main roster, Banks and Charlotte began a rivalry with Bayley, who had aligned herself with Natalya, and lost in both singles and tag team matches. On April 6, Banks made an appearance at WrestleMania XXX as a part of Triple H's entrance. In May, Banks entered a tournament for the vacant NXT Women's Championship, defeating Bayley in the first round, but losing to Natalya in the semi-finals. On the July 3 episode of NXT, Banks and Charlotte defeated Bayley and Becky Lynch, only for Charlotte to leave Banks after the match to get attacked by Bayley, with Banks officially disbanding the BFFs in a backstage segment later that night.  NXT Women's Champion (2014‚Äì2015)  Banks wrestling Charlotte during a house show On the August 14 episode of NXT, Banks lost to Bayley in a match to determine the number one contender to the NXT Women's Championship. At NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way on September 11, Banks attacked Bayley after her title match with Charlotte, before Charlotte stopped her. Becky Lynch turned on Bayley and aligned herself with Banks on the October 23 episode of NXT after Banks defeated Bayley in a singles match. Banks promptly began feuding with NXT Women's Champion Charlotte, leading to a match between the two at NXT TakeOver: R Evolution on December 11 with Charlotte's championship on the line, which Banks lost. Banks received a rematch on the December 25 episode of NXT, where she was once again unsuccessful. Banks first appeared on WWE's main roster on the December 30, 2014 episode of Main Event, where she lost to Charlotte in a non-title match. On January 21, 2015, Banks received another title match against Charlotte, which she lost after Becky Lynch attacked Charlotte, causing a disqualification, which led to dissension between Banks and Lynch. NXT Women's Champion in March 2015 On February 11 at NXT TakeOver: Rival, Banks won the NXT Women's Championship by pinning Charlotte in a fatal four-way match that also involved Lynch and Bayley. Banks successfully retained the championship against Charlotte in a rematch on the March 4 episode of NXT, and against Alexa Bliss on March 25. At NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable on May 20, Banks defended and retained the title against Becky Lynch. On the July 8 episode of NXT, Banks teamed with Charlotte to defeat Emma and Dana Brooke, after which Charlotte challenged Banks to an NXT Women's Championship match, which Banks accepted. They had their championship match the following week on the July 15 episode of NXT, in which Banks retained the championship and the two shared a hug, with Charlotte raising Banks's hand as a sign of respect. At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn on August 22, Banks dropped the NXT Women's Championship to Bayley, thus ending her reign at 192 days. After the match, Banks celebrated with Bayley and former rivals Becky Lynch and Charlotte. The match was highly praised by critics and won Match of the Year at the NXT Year-End Awards. At NXT TakeOver: Respect on October 7, Banks was defeated by Bayley in the main event in the first women's 30-minute Iron man match in WWE history, losing two falls to three in what would be her last match in NXT.  Team B.A.D. (2015‚Äì2016)  Banks made her official debut on the July 13, 2015 episode of Raw along with Charlotte and Becky Lynch, after Stephanie McMahon called for a \\"revolution\\" in the WWE Divas division. While Lynch and Charlotte allied with Paige, who was feuding with Team Bella (Alicia Fox, Brie and Nikki Bella), Banks allied with Naomi and Tamina, who later dubbed themselves as Team B.A.D. (Beautiful and Dangerous), leading to a brawl between the three teams. In her WWE pay‚Äìper‚Äìview debut on July 19 at Battleground, Banks competed in a triple threat match against Charlotte and Brie Bella, which Charlotte won. Banks went on to defeat Paige twice, first by submission on the July 20 episode of Raw, in a tag team match where Banks teamed with Naomi for the first time, and again on the July 27 episode of Raw in a singles match. After defeating the Divas Champion Nikki Bella by submission in a non‚Äìtitle match on the August 17 episode of Raw, Banks participated in the first ever Divas number one contender's Beat the Clock challenge match, in which she fought Paige to a time limit draw and Charlotte was named the number one contender. Following this, Banks rekindled her rivalry with Paige and defeated her twice on the September 7 and 14 episodes of Raw. Although she lost in a fatal four‚Äìway number one contender's match for Charlotte's Divas Championship in November, Banks was not pinned and began a winning streak, defeating the likes of Brie Bella, Alicia Fox, and Becky Lynch on various shows. Banks celebrating a win at a Raw event in April 2016 After a month off television, Banks returned at the Royal Rumble pay‚Äìper‚Äìview on January 24, 2016, attacking Charlotte and Becky Lynch after their championship match, showing her intentions to gain the Divas Championship. Prior to a match with Lynch on the February 1 episode of Raw, Banks claimed that she was \\"on her own\\", signaling that she had moved on from Team B.A.D., only to be attacked by Naomi and Tamina during the match, turning Banks into a fan favorite in the process. The feud between Banks and Naomi and Tamina continued throughout February, and led to a tag team match at Fastlane on February 21, where Banks allied with Lynch to defeat the two. Banks and Lynch went on to compete in two matches to determine the number one contender for Charlotte's Divas Championship at WrestleMania 32, with the first bout ending in a draw after a double pin occurred as both of their shoulders were down for the count, and the second in a no contest after both Banks and Lynch were attacked by Charlotte. As a result, a triple threat match between Banks, Lynch and Charlotte for the Divas Championship was announced for WrestleMania. At the event on April 3, the Divas Championship was retired and replaced with the new WWE Women's Championship, with all three women competing for it in the triple threat match; Banks was unsuccessful in capturing the new title at her WrestleMania in-ring debut.  Raw Women's Champion (2016‚Äì2017)  Banks in May 2017 After a hiatus, Banks returned to WWE television in early June, and later reignited her feud with Charlotte over the WWE Women's Championship after an attack along with Paige on the June 20 episode of Raw. This led to a tag team match the following week, on the June 27 episode of Raw, where Banks and Paige scored the victory. Following multiple attacks and matches between Banks and Dana Brooke, Banks and her mystery partner Bayley defeated Brooke and Charlotte in a tag team match on July 24 at Battleground. After being drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, 2016, Banks made her first appearance for the brand on July 25, where she defeated Charlotte to win the WWE Women's Championship for the first time. On August 21 at SummerSlam, Banks dropped the championship back to Charlotte, ending her reign at 27 days. Around that time the title was renamed the Raw Women's Championship following the creation of the SmackDown Women's Championship. On September 25, Charlotte successfully retained the championship against Banks and Bayley in a triple threat match at Clash of Champions. Banks was granted a one-on-one rematch on the October 3 episode of Raw, where she defeated Charlotte in the main event to capture her second Raw Women's Championship. Banks challenged Charlotte to compete for the championship in the first ever women's Hell in a Cell match at the titular Hell in a Cell pay-per-view event on October 30, which was then announced as the main event, making it the first time women had received the last match of a pay-per-view card in WWE. At the event, Charlotte defeated Banks, again ending her reign at 27 days. A few weeks later, on November 20, Banks was part of Raw's women's team for Survivor Series, during which she was eliminated by Natalya, but Team Raw was ultimately victorious. On the November 28 episode of Raw, after invoking her rematch clause a week prior, Banks defeated Charlotte in a falls count anywhere match to win the Raw Women's Championship for the record‚Äìtying third time. A 30‚Äìminute Iron man match between the two took place at Roadblock: End of the Line on December 18, which resulted in a 2‚Äì2 draw, but Banks lost to Flair 3‚Äì2 in sudden death overtime. With the loss, the feud between the two was ended, since it was stipulated that Banks could not invoke her rematch clause if she lost. The next night on Raw after Roadblock, Banks called Flair out to congratulate her on her victory, but Nia Jax came out instead and attacked her. This led to a match between the two at the Royal Rumble pre‚Äìshow on January 29, 2017, where Banks was defeated. On the February 13 episode of Raw, Banks helped Bayley defeat Charlotte Flair to win the Raw Women's Championship in the main event after she stopped Flair's submission and attacked her with her crutches. Banks gained revenge on Jax as she defeated her at Fastlane on March 5, thus handing Nia her first loss since she joined the main roster. Banks again helped Bayley defeat Flair to retain her championship. The feud between Banks and Jax, and Bayley and Flair led to a fatal four-way elimination match at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Bayley retained the Raw Women's Championship. On the June 26 episode of Raw, Banks scored a victory over Bayley, Jax, Dana Brooke, Mickie James and Emma in a gauntlet match to become the number one contender for Alexa Bliss's Raw Women's Championship. Banks received her title match on July 9 at Great Balls of Fire, where she defeated Bliss via count‚Äìout, which allowed Bliss to retain the title. In a rematch between the two on August 20 at SummerSlam, Banks defeated Bliss to become a record-tying four-time Raw Women's Champion. Eight days later, Banks dropped the title back to Bliss on Raw. At No Mercy on September 24, Banks received her rematch for the title as she took part in a fatal five-way match which was won by Bliss.  Partnership with Bayley (2017‚Äì2019)  At the end of 2017, Banks alongside Bayley and Mickie James started a feud with the debuting faction Absolution (Paige, Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville) who continuously attacked them on different occasions. That led to various singles and tag team matches, that were mostly won by Absolution. Also in December, Banks competed in the first ever women's match contested in the Middle East against Alexa Bliss. On January 28, 2018 at the Royal Rumble, Banks was the first entry in the first Women's Royal Rumble match, and she eliminated Vickie Guerrero, Bayley and Trish Stratus, lasting 54:46, due to being outside the ring for most of that time, before being eliminated by The Bella Twins. A few weeks later, on February 25, Banks took part in the first ever women's elimination chamber match at the namesake pay-per-view, where she helped Alexa Bliss, the eventual winner, eliminate Bayley from the match after she pushed her off the pod when the two were \\"apparently\\" working together to eliminate Bliss. On the March 26 episode of Raw, after weeks of animosity between the two, including Bayley betraying Banks during their matches, they brawled backstage and had to be separated. Banks and Bayley faced off in mid- April but their match ended in a no-contest after The Riott Squad (Ruby Riott, Sarah Logan, and Liv Morgan) interfered and attacked them both. In the following weeks, Banks competed in different singles and tag team matches in both winning and losing efforts. In June, after she defeated Ruby Riott in the finals of a gauntlet match for the last spot, Banks competed for the first time in her career in a Money in the Bank ladder match, that was ultimately won by Alexa Bliss. Throughout mid-2018, after Banks and Bayley continued to attack each other, they were told to attend counsellor meetings to help maintain their friendship. In July, the two reconciled and created a tag team, known as \\"The Boss 'n' Hug Connection\\". After a short hiatus from the ring due to an undisclosed injury, Banks returned to WWE television in October, and took part in the first ever all women's pay‚Äìper‚Äìview Evolution, where she teamed with Bayley and Natalya in a winning effort against The Riott Squad. In November, Banks again competed at Survivor Series as part of Team Raw, where she was the last woman from the team that was eliminated by Asuka after an attack by teammate Nia Jax. On January 27, 2019, at the Royal Rumble, after she defeated Nia Jax to earn herself a title match, Banks unsuccessfully challenged Ronda Rousey for the Raw Women's Championship. On February 17, at the Elimination Chamber, Banks and Bayley won the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Championship by lastly eliminating Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville in a six tag team Elimination Chamber match. In their first title defense, Banks and Bayley successfully retained over Nia Jax and Tamina, at Fastlane, on March 10. At WrestleMania 35 on April 7, Banks and Bayley lost the championship to The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce) in a fatal four-way tag team match after Kay pinned Bayley, ending their reign at 49 days.  Hiatus and heel turn (2019‚Äì2020)  Banks with a fan in November 2019 The following day, Banks canceled an appearance on the morning talk show Wendy at the last minute. Throughout the following week, speculation from dirt sheets emerged that she was looking to quit the company due to her longstanding frustrations with WWE. Banks held the impression that she and Bayley were going to have a long title reign to bring credibility to the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, with the two allegedly not being informed until the last minute that they would be dropping the titles at WrestleMania. Her talk show cancellation was reported to be due to a personal matter, but neither Banks nor WWE had confirmed the rumors of her attempted departure from the company. After a four-month hiatus, Banks returned on the August 12 episode of Raw, where she attacked a kayfabe injured Natalya, turning heel for the first time since 2016. Banks donned a new blue hair color beneath a purple wig and went on to attack Becky Lynch with a steel chair, after the latter tried to make the save for Natalya. In September, Banks reunited with then SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley, when the latter also turned heel, and the two attacked both Lynch and Charlotte Flair. Upon her return, Banks reignited her feud with Lynch, which led to a match between the two at Clash of Champions for Lynch's Raw Women's Championship on September 15. At the event, Banks took a win via disqualification after Lynch inadvertently attacked the referee with a steel chair, and after the match, the two continued to brawl inside the arena. The feud between the two women eventually led to the second-ever women's Hell in a Cell match, which took place on October 6 at the namesake pay-per-view, in which Banks was unsuccessful in capturing the title. Banks was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2019 draft. Banks then went on another brief hiatus from TV due to injuring her tailbone, and was not cleared to compete. Banks did however, come to SmackDown on October 18, as Bayley was being interviewed by The Miz. On the November 8 episode of SmackDown, Banks debuted a new remixed theme featuring her cousin Snoop Dogg. On the same episode, it was announced that Banks would be the captain of the SmackDown women's team, leading into Survivor Series. At the pay-per-view, Banks was the last woman standing for the SmackDown brand in the Women's Survivor Series match, however lost to Rhea Ripley from Team NXT. Banks was a fan favorite to win the 2020 Women's Royal Rumble match, however was absent from the event and several episodes of SmackDown preceding it, which led to speculation that she had sustained an injury. During a backstage segment on the January 17 episode of SmackDown, the camera panned to Bayley and Lacey Evans in a brawl, during which Banks was on the floor. The latter had been slated to have a match against Evans later on in the night, however was replaced by Bayley during a segment showing a kayfabe injured Banks in the doctor's office. On the February 28 episode of SmackDown, Banks once again made her return by attacking Naomi, Bayley's opponent. On the March 20 episode of SmackDown, Banks and Bayley interrupted a segment featuring Paige, who was slated to confront the latter in the week prior, but was absent due to travel issues. During the segment, Paige proceeded to announce a six-way elimination match (later announced to take place as a fatal five-way) at WrestleMania 36 for Bayley's SmackDown Women's Championship, in which Banks was inserted. At the event, Bayley retained the title with assistance from Banks.  Double champion and feud with Bayley (2020‚Äìpresent)  After WrestleMania 36, Banks and Bayley would begin teasing a potential feud between the two, with the emphasis being put on the narrative that Banks is the reason for Bayley's success and Bayley is responsible for most of Banks' losing efforts. Despite their brewing dispute, Banks and Bayley reclaimed the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship on the June 5 episode of SmackDown by defeating Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross. They defended the titles against various teams such as Bliss and Cross, Shotzi Blackheart and Tegan Nox, The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), and The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane). That same month, Banks challenged Asuka to a match at The Horror Show at Extreme Rules for the Raw Women's Championship, which she accepted. At the event, which took place on July 19, her match with Asuka ended in controversy when Asuka inadvertently spat green mist in the referee's face, which led to Bayley removing the referee's shirt and counting the pin for Banks to unofficially win the title. The following night on Raw, Stephanie McMahon announced that a match between the two would take place on July 27, further stating that the title can change hands via pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification. Banks eventually won the match and the title for a record-setting fifth time, after Asuka left the ring to save her tag team partner Kairi Sane, who was attacked backstage by Bayley. With Banks and Bayley concurrently holding the Raw, SmackDown, and Women's Tag Team Championships, they became the first female tag team - and the fifth team overall - in history to hold singles and tag team titles simultaneously. Throughout August, Asuka and Banks continued their feud, which culminated in a title match at SummerSlam on August 23, where Banks dropped the Raw Women's Championship back to Asuka. The following night on Raw, Banks was unsuccessful in recapturing the title in a lumberjack match. On August 30, at the Payback pay-per-view, Banks and Bayley lost the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship to the newly-formed team of Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler. On the September 4 episode of SmackDown, after losing a rematch to Jax and Baszler, Bayley turned on Banks by brutally attacking her in the ring, thereby turning the latter face in the process and disbanding their team. After attacking and cutting promos on each other, the two faced off in a title match on the October 9 episode of SmackDown, which Banks won via disqualification after Bayley hit her with a steel chair, resulting in the latter retaining her SmackDown Women's Championship. After the match, Banks challenged Bayley to a Hell in a Cell match at the eponymous pay-per-view, which she accepted. == Other media == Video games * As Sasha Banks, she made her video game debut in WWE 2K17, and has since appeared in WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19, and WWE 2K20.

From 1943-45, the team was part of the Gauliga Weser-Ems (I), the war- weakened successor to the Gauliga Niedersachsen (I), which was one of 13 regional circuits established in the 1933 reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. Only a single season of play was completed in the Gauliga Weser-Ems before competition collapsed just 2 or 3 games into the 1944-45 season because of the war.

Postwar and formation of TS After the conflict, ATV reemerged in late 1945, followed by TV 1890 in the spring of 1946. The former membership of FV 1900 joined ATV to create Sportverein Woltmershausen von 1896 on 8 March 1947.

A strategic authority, with responsibilities for roads, public transport, planning, emergency services and waste disposal, it was composed of 88 directly elected members drawn from the five metropolitan boroughs of West Yorkshire. West Yorkshire County Council shared power with five lower-tier district councils, each of which directed local matters. ==History== Established with reference to the Local Government Act 1972, elections in 1973 brought about the county council's launch as a shadow authority, several months before West Yorkshire (its zone of influence) was officially created on 1 April 1974. The West Yorkshire County Council operated from County Hall, Wakefield, until it was abolished 31 March 1986, following the Local Government Act 1985. Its powers were passed to the five district councils of West Yorkshire (which had shared power with WYCC): City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council, Calderdale Council, Kirklees Council, Leeds City Council and Wakefield Metropolitan District Council. Some powers of the county council were restored when the district councils delegated strategic responsibilities (such as emergency services and public transport) to the county-wide West Yorkshire Joint Services and joint boards. Its headquarters were County Hall in Wakefield. This was built in 1888 for West Riding County Council, which occupied it until its abolition in 1974. The building is now the home of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council. The council's 88 members were first elected on 12 April 1973, to take office on 1 April 1974. They were elected for four years, and elections were held each four years thereafter. The Coat of arms of West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council was granted by letters patent in 1975.

Some council functions including archive services and Trading Standards continued to be provided jointly, through West Yorkshire Joint Services, and the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and West Yorkshire Police continue to operate across the county. In 2012, plans to revive a top-tier administrative combined authority for West Yorkshire were revealed, with Peter McBride, cabinet member for housing and investment and councillor for Kirklees, stating \\"what we are recreating in effect is the West Yorkshire County Council in another form, which the government abolished in 1986 but has come to realise that you need a body of that size\\".Council plans depend on a new authority ‚Äì Dewsbury Reporter The West Yorkshire Combined Authority was created in April 2014. == References == Category:Local government in West Yorkshire Category:Former county councils of England Category:History of West Yorkshire Category:1974 establishments in England Category:1986 disestablishments in England ","title":"West Yorkshire County Council"},{"id":"35347744","text":"Schoenoplectiella hallii is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family known by the common name Hall's bulrush.

Flora of North America. Some flowers may also be produced on short stems that barely emerge from the leaf sheaths later in the season. This species grows in wet, sandy soils next to water bodies such as ponds and lakes. It is adapted to a habitat with fluctuating water levels.Schoenoplectus hallii. Center for Plant Conservation. This fluctuation prevents many other types of plants from moving into the area and competing with the sedge. Threats to this plant include anything that alters the hydrology of the habitat, for example, anything that prevents the fluctuating water levels and flooding that the plant requires. Other threats include loss of habitat to development or agriculture, livestock activity, off-road vehicle use, pollution, road maintenance, and habitat fragmentation. == Taxonomy == This sedge was first described by Asa Gray in 1862 as Scirpus Hallii. Gray later (1867) described it as S. supinus var. Hallii. In 1995, the American botanist, Stanley Galen Smith, transferred it to the genus, Schoenoplectus, and Schoenoplectus hallii was the accepted name until it was transferred in 2003 to the genus, Schoenoplectiella, by Kaare Arnstein Lye. ==References *USDA Plants Profile * hallii Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1862 ","title":"Schoenoplectiella hallii"},{"id":"35347758","text":"Digitivalva solidaginis is a moth of the family Acrolepiidae.

The company's first production was the Pink Floyd Ballet. Roland Petit's young daughter had given him a Pink Floyd album and told him he should make a ballet from it. The idea matured, and the ballet eventually debuted in Marseille at the Palais des Sports. The band itself performed at the first show. Since then the Pink Floyd Ballet has been staged several times in cities around the world. Under Roland Petit the company's program included modern dance featuring Petit's wife Zizi Jeanmaire. In 1992 the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Danse de Marseille (Marseille National Higher School of Dance) was established. The company and the school were housed in a new building with a 300-seat theater and nine rehearsal studios, two of which are reserved for the company. The company has a staff of 70, of whom half are dancers. The school has an intake of about 120 students each year, providing nine years of training in dance. Marie-Claude Pietragalla was appointed Director General of the company and of the school in March 1998, holding this position until 2004. Fr√©d√©ric Flamand was appointed artistic director in September 2004.

The system uses a charging pad and a compatible device, which is placed on top of the pad, charging via resonant inductive coupling. Mobile device manufacturers that are working with the standard include Apple, Asus, Google, HTC, Huawei, LG Electronics, Motorola Mobility, Nokia, Samsung, BlackBerry, Xiaomi, and Sony. First released in 2008, the Qi standard had by 2019 been incorporated into more than 160 smartphones, tablets and other devices. == Version history == {  + Qi Versions !Version number !Released !Maximum wattage !Notes - 1.0 2010 5 W Power transmitter can be a single coil, coil array, or moving coil. - 1.1 2012 5 W 12 different transmitter specifications, foreign object detection to prevent heating of metal objects near transmitter, added powering transmitter over USB - 1.2 2015 Baseline Power Profile (BPP): 5W Extended Power Profile (EPP): 15 W Increased maximum transmitter power to 15W, improved thermal tests for transmitters, improved timing specs, improved foreign object detection sensitivity, optional receiver ID (WP-ID).

Under the Qi specification, \\"low power\\" inductive transfers deliver power below 5 W using inductive coupling between two planar coils. These coils are typically 5 mm apart but can be up to 40 mm and possibly farther apart. The Qi low-power specification has been renamed to the Qi Baseline Power Profile (BPP). Regulation of the output voltage is provided by a digital control loop where the power receiver communicates with the power transmitter and requests more or less power. Communication is unidirectional from the power receiver to the power transmitter via backscatter modulation. In backscatter modulation, the power-receiver coil is loaded, changing the current draw at the power transmitter. These current changes are monitored and demodulated into the information required for the two devices to work together.LG WCP-300 Qi charging pad Opened Nokia DT-900 Qi charger In 2011, the Wireless Power Consortium began to extend the Qi specification to medium power. As of 2019, the Medium Power standard currently delivers 30 to 65 W, it is expected to eventually support up to 200 W (typically used for portable power tools, robotic vacuum cleaners, drones and e-bikes). In 2015, the WPC also demonstrated a high-power specification \\"Ki\\" that will deliver up to 1 kW, allowing the powering of kitchen appliances among other high-power utilities.  Extended Power Profile (EPP)  In 2015, WPC introduced the Qi Extended Power Profile (EPP) specification which supports up to 15 W. EPP is also typically used to charge mobile devices like BPP. Phone companies that support Extended Power Profile (EPP) include: LG Electronics, Sony, Xiaomi, and Sharp Corporation.  Proprietary Power Delivery Extension (PPDE)  WPC introduced Proprietary Power Delivery Extension (PPDE) to allow phone OEMs to deliver higher than Baseline Power Profile's 5W or the Extended Power Profile's 15W. Currently only Samsung has published their compliance test.

Since then, every new iPhone version has supported the Qi wireless charging standard. Apple also announced plans to expand the standard with a new protocol called AirPower which would have added the ability to charge multiple devices at once; however, this was canceled on March 29, 2019.https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing- inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/ As the Qi standard gains popularity, it is expected that Qi Hotspots will begin to arise in places such as coffee shops, airports, sports arenas, etc. The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, a major US coffee chain, will install inductive charging stations at selected major metropolitan cities, as well as Virgin Atlantic, for United Kingdom's London Heathrow Airport and New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Automobile manufacturers have been adding QI charging as standard or optional features since 2013. == System overview == Devices that operate with the Qi standard rely on electromagnetic induction between planar coils. A Qi system consists of two types of devices ‚Äì the Base Station, which is connected to a power source and provides inductive power, and Mobile Devices, which consume inductive power. The Base Station contains a power transmitter that comprises a transmitting coil that generates an oscillating magnetic field; the Mobile Device contains a power receiver holding a receiving coil. The magnetic field induces an alternating current in the receiving coil by Faraday's law of induction. Close spacing of the two coils, as well as shielding on their surfaces, ensure the inductive power transfer is efficient. Base Stations typically have a flat surface‚Äîreferred to as the Interface Surface‚Äîon top of which a user can place one or more Mobile Devices. There are two methods for aligning the transmitting coil (part of the Base Station) and receiving coil (part of the Mobile Device) in order for a power transfer to happen. In the first concept‚Äîcalled guided positioning‚Äîa user must place the Mobile Device on a certain location of the Base Station's surface. For this purpose, the Mobile Device provides an alignment aid that is appropriate to its size, shape and function. The second concept‚Äîreferred to as free positioning‚Äîdoes not require the user to place the Mobile Device in direct alignment with the transmitting coil. There are several ways to achieve free positioning. In one example a bundle of transmitting coils is used to generate a magnetic field at the location of the receiving coil only. Another example uses mechanical means to move a single transmitting coil underneath the receiving coil. A third option is to use a technique called \\"Multiple Cooperative Flux Generators.\\"Fig. 1-1Figure 1-1 illustrates the basic system configuration. As shown, a power transmitter includes two main functional units‚Äîa power conversion unit and a communications and control unit. The diagram shows the transmitting coil (array) generating the magnetic field as part of the power conversion unit. The control and communications unit regulates the transferred power to the level that the power receiver requests. The diagram also demonstrates that a Base Station may contain numerous transmitters, allowing for multiple Mobile Devices to be placed on the same Base Station and inductively charge until each of its batteries are fully charged. Finally, the system unit in the diagram comprises all other functionality of the Base Station, such as input power provisioning, control of multiple power transmitters, and user interfacing. A power receiver comprises a power pick-up unit, as well as a communications and control unit. Similar to the power conversion unit of the transmitter, Figure 1-1 illustrates the receiving coil as capturing the magnetic field of the power pick-up unit. A power pick-up unit typically contains a single receiving coil only. Moreover, a Mobile Device typically contains a single power receiver. The communications and control unit regulates the transferred power to the level that is appropriate for the subsystems (e.g., battery) connected to the output of the power receiver. These subsystems represent the main functionality of the Mobile Device.  Example power transmitter hardware  As an example from the 2017 version 1.2.2 of the Qi specification (referenced above), the A2 reference Qi low-power transmitter has a coil of 20 turns (in two layers) in a flat coil, wound on a form with a 19mm inner diameter and a 40mm outer diameter, with a below-coil shield of soft iron at least 4mm larger in diameter which gives an inductance of 24¬±1 microhenries. This coil is placed in a series resonant circuit with a 200 nF capacitor to yield a resonant circuit with a natural resonance at ~140 kHz when coupled to the receiver coil. This series resonant circuit is then driven by an H-bridge switching arrangement from the DC source; at full power, the voltage in the capacitor can reach 50 volts. Power control is automatic; the Qi specification requires that the actual voltage applied be controllable in steps at least as small as 50 millivolts. Rather than down-regulate the charging voltage in the device, Qi chargers meeting the A2 reference use a PID (proportional-integral- derivative) controller to modulate the delivered power according to the primary cell voltage. Other Qi charge transmitters start their connections at 140 kHz, but can change frequencies to find a frequency with a better match, as the mutual inductance between transmitter and receiver coils will vary according to the standoff distance between transmitter and receiver coils, and thus the natural resonance frequency will vary. Different Qi reference designs have different coil arrangements, including oval coil and multi-coil systems as well as more complex resonance networks with multiple inductors and capacitors. These designs allow frequency-agile operation at frequencies from 105 to 205 kHz and with maximum resonant circuit voltages as high as 200 volts.  Example power receiver hardware  The Qi power receiver hardware reference design 1, also from version 1.2.2 of the Qi specification, starts with a rectangular coil of wire 44 mm x 30 mm outside size, with 14 turns of wire, and with an above-coil magnetic shield. This coil is wired into a parallel resonant circuit with a pair of capacitors (of 127 nanofarads in series and 1.6 nanofarads in parallel). The power output is taken across the 1.6 nanofarad capacitor. In order to provide a digital communications channel back to the power transmitter, a resonance modulator consisting of a pair of 22 nanofarad capacitors and a 10 kŒ© resistor in a T configuration can be switched across the 1.6 nanofarad capacitor. Switching the T network across the 1.6 nanofarad capacitor causes a significant change in the resonant frequency of the coupled system that is detected by the power transmitter as a change in the delivered power. Power output to the portable device is via a full-wave bridge wired across the 1.6 nanofarad capacitor; the power is typically filtered with a 20 microfarad capacitor before delivery to the charge controller. Other Qi power receivers use alternate resonance modulators, including switching a resistor or pair of resistors across the receiver resonator capacitor, both before and after the bridge rectifier. == See also == * Wireless power transfer * Inductive coupling * Resonant inductive coupling * Near field communication * Rezence, a competing wireless power standard promoted by The Alliance for Wireless Power and the Power Matters Alliance * WiPower, a formerly competing wireless power standard promoted by The Alliance For Wireless Power that merged with PMA to form Rezence * PMA, a formerly competing wireless power standard promoted by the Power Matters Alliance that merged with WiPower to form Rezence * Open Dots, a formerly competing wireless power standard promoted by the Open Dots Alliance == References  External links == * ‚Äì official site Category:Wireless energy transfer Category:Computer-related introductions in 2009 Category:Open standards Category:Wireless Power Consortium ","title":"Qi (standard)"},{"id":"35347944","text":"Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor by William Halsall (1882) William Mullins (c. 1572 - 1621) and his family traveled as passengers on the historic 1620 voyage to America on the Pilgrim ship Mayflower. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact. Mullins perished in the pilgrims' first winter in the New World, with his wife and son dying soon after.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 331Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 193Pilgrim Hall Museum William Museum == Early life in England == William Mullins was born about 1572 in Dorking, County Surrey, England, probably the son of John Mullins and Joan/Joane (Bridger) of Dorking parish, located about 21 miles south of London. John Mullins died in February 1583/84 and William's mother Joane married secondly Vincent Benham on November 1, 1585. The Dorking Register shows baptisms, marriages and burials of persons with the name of \\"Mullyns\\" between 1571 and 1585 and then a gap in those names of about twenty-five years until more names of this family appear. The first mention of William Mullins in Dorking records was on October 4, 1595, when he was fined, at about age 23, two pence by the manorial court for non-attendance at that year's session. That record states that he was then residing in the Chippingborough district of Dorking. Records note a William Mullins named on a 1596 muster list for Stoke, near Guildford, co. Surrey, where it is believed he was living at that time, and returning to Dorking about 1604. While in Guildford it is believed that Mullins married for a first time, name of wife unknown. During that time, it is also believed that his first wife gave birth to at least one daughter, name Elizabeth, with baptism recorded at Holy Trinity Church, Guildford on December 11, 1598. Elizabeth may have died young. Authors Caleb Johnson and Charles Edward Banks have indicated that this unnamed wife may have given birth to a son and daughter prior to the 1598 birth of Elizabeth.Charles Edward Banks, The English ancestry and homes of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623, (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2006), p. 74 Records for Dorking dated October 5, 1604, again name William Mullins, then residing in the Eastborough district there where he was the head of a \\"frankpledge\\" ‚Äì a group of ten families bonded to the king for their good behavior. And if one member of the group was fined or punished, all members would be punished, which is what happened on September 19, 1605 when Mullins and his frankpledge were fined for an unknown transgression. Dorking records exist for several dates in 1612 for William Mullins: On March 30, 1612 ‚Äì William Mullins witnessed the will of John Wood. On December 20, 1612 ‚Äì Mullins was named the overseer of the will of Jane Hammon. That document, for the first time, states Mullins occupation as shoemaker. On December 28, 1612 ‚Äì Mullins purchased a tenement on West Street in Dorking. This house still exists and is often a stopping place for tourists. Banks refers to this house as the \\"Manor of Dorking.\\"Charles Edward Banks, The English ancestry and homes of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623, (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2006), p. 73Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 194 In August (Banks says April 29) 1616 William Mullins was called before the Lordships of the Privy Council and held for an unknown reason for a period of time. On May 1 he appeared before the Privy Council and was technically continued in their custody \\" by their Honours' order hee be dismissed.\\" It has been speculated that this may have involved matters of a religious nature which may have forced Mullins to consider emigrating. In May 1619 Mullins sold his Dorking Manor holdings to Ephraim Bothell/Bothall for 280 pounds, which may have been a precursor of his preparations for the Mayflower voyage. It appears he made a good living as a shoemaker as his was one of the larger investments in the Merchant Adventurers group, of which he was a member, which was investing in the Pilgrim venture. His will shows he had nine shares of stock in the Merchant Adventurers and that his estate consisted primarily of boots and shoes.Charles Edward Banks, The English ancestry and homes of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623, (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2006), pp. 73-74 The London businessmen known as the Merchant Adventurers, under the direction of Thomas Weston, invested in the Mayflower voyage from the very beginning. The documents drawn up, and approved by members of the Leiden church, imposed certain restrictions on the Pilgrims work week, to which they agreed. But as the time to depart England drew near, the Adventurers wanted the restrictions tightened which would have caused the Pilgrims to work almost 7 days a week, in an effect to increase profits, without such as due time for religious activities. The Pilgrims balked at this and refused to agree to the new terms. William Mullins played a part in these deliberations, probably because he had a large investment and needed to ensure a satisfactory return on it, as an Adventurers member. And although Robert Cushman, who had been the Leiden agent for Mayflower voyage preparations, came to Plymouth in November 1621 to try to settle the rift between the Pilgrims and the Adventurers, it was never resolved. Eventually the Pilgrims bought out the Adventurers and formed their own investment company.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking, 2006), p. 40 == On the Mayflower == Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 When the Mullins family boarded the Mayflower, they consisted of William, then about age fifty, his wife Alice, daughter Priscilla and son Joseph, as well as a servant. They boarded the ship with the London contingent, and not as part of the Leiden religionists. Mullins was a shoemaker and businessman, and carried with him a large stock of boots and shoes. The family had left behind in Dorking the two eldest children, Sarah, about age 22 and probably married, and William, possibly in his late 20s and married. These two older children may have been borne by a first wife of Mullins. His daughter Sarah, married to a man named Blunden, was his estate administrator, as requested in Mullins will.Nick Bunker, Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and their New World a History (New York: Knopf 2010), p. 262 Recording those on board the Mayflower, William Bradford wrote of Mullins as \\"Mr. William Mullins\\", possibly as he was somewhat more prosperous than many of the original settlers: \\"Mr. William Mullines, and his wife, and *2* children, Joseph and Priscila; and a servant, Robart Carter.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 332, 406 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. William Mullins signed The Mayflower Compact 11/21 1620.Allison Lassieur Peter McDonnall, The voyage of the Mayflower (Minnesota: Capstone Press, ¬©2006)George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document, pp. 7-19. == In the New World == William Mullins, his wife Alice and son Joseph all died within months of arriving in the New World, along with their servant Robert Carter. Only their daughter Priscilla survived. William may have been the first of the family to die, probably on February 21, 1621. In his will, written on his deathbed, he mentioned \\"my man Robert\\" indicating Carter was still alive then. Per Stratton, Alice, her son Joseph and servant Robert Carter were all alive on April 5, 1621 when the Mayflower set sail on its return voyage to England, but all had died before the arrival of the ship Fortune in mid-November of that year.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 195Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 259, 331 == Family == The Family section has been revised based on an article about the William Mullins family by noted Mayflower researcher and biographer Caleb Johnson which appeared in the March 2012 Mayflower Quarterly. Mr. Johnson reviewed hundreds of pages of material on this family in England, in particular about the two wives of William Mullins. What he has created is what he refers to as a speculative hypothesis with genealogical information that he believes is entirely reasonable and plausible.Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 78, no. 1, March 2012, An investigation into the origins of Alice wife of William Mullins by Caleb H. Johnson, pp. 44-57 William Mullins probably married firstly Elizabeth Wood in Stoke, near Guildford, co. Surrey, England sometime prior to December 1598 ‚Äì possibly in the early 1590s. She was the daughter of John and Joan (Taylor) Wood. She died sometime prior to 1604. Children believed of that first marriage: * William Mullins Jr., possibly born about 1593 and died in 1674 in New England, coming there sometime after his father's death. Records for the 1643 Able to Bear Arms List for \\"Duxborrow\\" (Duxbury) note a \\"Wm Mullens.\\" :He married: :1. _________ by 1618 and had one daughter. :2. Ann (___) Bell in Boston on May 7, 1656 as her second husband. * Sarah Mullins, born possibly late 1590s. She married _____ Blunden by 1621 and remained in England. She was named the estate administrator in her father's will and was awarded administration in July 1621. No further information. * Elizabeth Mullins, baptized December 11, 1598 at Holy Trinity Church, Guildford, co. Surrey. She may have died young. * Priscilla Mullins was born about 1603 and died between 1651 and September 12, 1687, the date of her husband's death. She had been a passenger on the Mayflower with her parents and her brother Joseph, and only she survived after their deaths in 1621. She married Mayflower cooper John Alden before 1623 and had eleven children. The only proven descendants of William Mullins living today are descended from Priscilla. Second wife of William Mullins and child of that marriage: William Mullins married secondly Alice _____ possibly ca 1605. Her ancestry is unrecorded. She may have been the widow of two possible men with the surname Browne. She died in Plymouth in the winter of 1620/1. Child believed of his second marriage: *Joseph Mullins, born about 1606. He was a passenger on the Mayflower with his parents and sister Priscilla. He died after the first winter in Plymouth ‚Äì sometime in 1621 between April 5 and mid-November, date unknown. His corrected birth year per Johnson.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), pp. 193-194 == Will of William Mullins == The will of William Mullins was the first one written in New England. It was written for him on his deathbed by Governor John Carver and witnessed by Dr. Giles Heale, surgeon of the Mayflower and its captain, Christopher Jones. His is the only known will of a Mayflower passenger who died that winter, with it being taken back to England on the Mayflower's return trip. His will states that he was owed monies by \\"Goodman Wood\\" in the amount of 40 pounds of which he made distribution to family members in his will. Except for 10 pounds he gave to his daughter Sarah, he bequeathed all his stocks and bonds to his son William. He also made distribution of all goods and supplies brought with him on the Mayflower to family members as well as twenty-one dozen pairs of shoes and thirteen pairs of boots which he requested be sold to the New Plymouth Company. He also divided his shares in the joint-stock company among family members as well as stipulating that if his son William should ever come to Plymouth ‚Äì which he eventually did ‚Äì he would inherit his property there. The probate record of his will has the Latin annotation \\"nuper de Dorking defunctus in partibus transmarinis\\" indicating he formerly resided in Dorking, co. Surrey. The original will still survives today. == Death and burial of William Mullins, his wife Alice and son Joseph == William Mullins died on February 21, 1621, coincidentally the same date as another Mayflower passenger, William White, whose wife Susannah did survive. William Mullins' wife Alice and son Joseph are believed to have died sometime after the departure of the Mayflower for England on April 5, 1621 and before the arrival of the ship Fortune in mid-November 1621. William was buried in Coles Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth, probably in an unmarked grave as was common in those early days. His wife Alice and son Joseph died sometime later in 1621 and were also buried in Coles Hill Burial Ground. The family is memorialized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, Coles Hill, as \\"William Mullins, Alice his wife and Joseph their son.\\" Memorial for William Mullins == Apprentice in the company of the William Mullins family on the Mayflower == Robert Carter was an apprentice or manservant of William Mullins. He did not sign the Mayflower Compact in November 1620 and is believed to have been under age twenty-one at the time, probably in his late teens. Since he was traveling in the company of the Mullins family of Dorking, Surrey, it can be speculated that Carter came from this area as well, although his ancestry is uncertain. When William Mullins died in February 1621, his will instructed his overseers \\"to have a special eye to my man Robert which hath not so much proved himself as I would he should have done.\\" But Robert Carter died soon after his master's death.Caleb H.

However, the perception, capture, treatment and duties of both groups of slaves differed markedly,Catherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 116. with Oromo favored because Oromo subjects were not viewed as racially jareer by their Somali captors. ==History== Origin Bantu slave woman in Mogadishu (1882‚Äì1883) Between 2500‚Äì3000 years ago, speakers of the original proto- Bantu language group began a millennia-long series of migrations eastward from their original homeland in the general Nigeria and Cameroon area of West Africa.Philip J. Adler, Randall L. Pouwels, World Civilizations: To 1700 Volume 1 of World Civilizations, (Cengage Learning: 2007), p.169. This Bantu expansion first introduced Bantu peoples to central, southern and southeastern Africa, regions where they had previously been absent from.Toyin Falola, Aribidesi Adisa Usman, Movements, borders, and identities in Africa, (University Rochester Press: 2009), p.4. The Bantus inhabiting Somalia are descended from Bantu groups that had settled in Southeast Africa after the initial expansion from Nigeria/Cameroon, and whose members were later captured and sold into the Arab slave trade. Bantus are ethnically, physically, and culturally distinct from Somalis, and they have remained marginalized ever since their arrival in Somalia.L. Randol Barker et al., Principles of Ambulatory Medicine, 7 edition, (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: 2006), p.633 All in all, the number of Bantu inhabitants in Somalia before the civil war is thought to have been about 80,000 (1970 estimate), with most concentrated between the Juba and Shabelle rivers in the south.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, v.20, (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, inc.: 1970), p.897 Recent estimates, however, place the figure as high as 900,000 persons. Arab slave trade The Indian Ocean slave trade was multi-directional and changed over time. To meet the demand for menial labor, Bantu slaves were captured by Somali slave traders from southeastern Africa were sold in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries to customers in Egypt, Arabia, the Persian Gulf, India, the Far East, the Indian Ocean islands, Ethiopia and Somalia. From 1800 to 1890, between 25,000 and 50,000 Bantu slaves are thought to have been sold from the slave market of Zanzibar alone to the Somali coast.p.8 Most of the slaves were from the Majindo, Makua, Nyasa, Yao, Zalama, Zaramo and Zigua ethnic groups of Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi. Collectively, these Bantu groups are known as Mushunguli, which is a term taken from Mzigula, the Zigua tribe's word for \\"people\\" (the word holds multiple implied meanings including \\"worker\\", \\"foreigner\\", and \\"slave\\").Refugee Reports, November 2002, Volume 23, Number 8 16th to 20th centuries Bantu adult and children slaves (referred to collectively as jareer by their Somali mastersCatherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 83-84) were purchased in the slave market exclusively to do undesirable work on plantation grounds. They were made to work in plantations owned by Somalis along the southern Shebelle and Jubba rivers, harvesting lucrative cash crops such as grain and cotton.Henry Louis Gates, Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience, (Oxford University Press: 1999), p.1746 Bantu slaves toiled under the control of and separately from their Somali patrons. In terms of legal considerations, Bantu slaves were devalued. Somali social mores strongly discouraged, censured and looked down upon any kind of sexual contact with Bantu slaves. Freedom for these plantation slaves was also often acquired through escape. As part of a broader practice then common among slave owners in Northeast Africa, some Somali masters in the hinterland near Mogadishu reportedly used to circumcise their female slaves so as to increase the latter's perceived value in the slave market. In 1609, the Portuguese missionary Jo√£o dos Santos reported that one such group had a \\"custome to sew up their females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their masters put in them.\\" In the 1940s, the first fugitive slaves from the Shebelle valley began to settle in the Jubba valley. The Italian colonial administration abolished slavery in Somalia at the turn of the 20th century. Some Bantu groups, however, remained enslaved well until the 1930s, and continued to be despised and discriminated against by large parts of Somali society. The Bantus were also conscripted to forced labor on Italian-owned plantations since the Somalis themselves were averse to what they deemed menial labor,Laitin, p.64. and because the Italians viewed the Somalis as racially superior to the Bantu.Catherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 120 Nilotic slaves In the late 19th century, Somalis also captured other jareer peoples from the coastal regions of Kenya to work for them as slaves and clients. Referred to as the Kore, these Nilo-Saharan Maa- speaking Nilotes were later emancipated by British colonial troops. They subsequently resettled on the Lamu seaboard as fishermen and cultivators. Like many Bantus, the Kore reportedly now speak the Afro-Asiatic Somali language on account of their time in servitude. ==Other slaves== In addition to Bantu plantation slaves, Somalis sometimes enslaved peoples of Oromo pastoral background that were captured during wars and raids on Oromo settlements.Bridget Anderson, World Directory of Minorities, (Minority Rights Group International: 1997), p. 456. However, there were marked differences in terms of the perception, capture, treatment and duties of the Oromo pastoral slaves versus the Bantu plantation slaves.Catherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 116. On an individual basis, Oromo subjects were not viewed as racially jareer by their Somali captors. The Oromo captives also mostly consisted of young children and women, both of whom were taken into the families of their abductors; men were usually killed during the raids. Oromo boys and girls were adopted by their Somali patrons as their own children. Prized for their beauty and viewed as legitimate sexual partners, many Oromo women became either wives or concubines of their Somali captors, while others became domestic servants. In some cases, entire Oromo clans were assimilated on a client basis into the Somali clan system. Neither captured Oromo children nor women were ever required to do plantation work, and they typically worked side-by-side with the Somali pastoralists. After an Oromo concubine gave birth to her Somali patron's child, she and the child were emancipated and the Oromo concubine acquired equal status to her abductor's other Somali wives. According to the Somali Studies pioneer Enrico Cerulli, in terms of diya (blood money) payments in the Somali customary law (Xeer), the life of an Oromo slave was also equal in value to that of an ordinary ethnic Somali.Catherine Lowe Besteman, Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 82. Freedom for Oromo slaves was obtained through manumission and was typically accompanied by presents such as a spouse and livestock. During abolition, former Oromo slaves, who generally maintained intimate relations with the Somali pastoralists, were also spared the harsh treatment reserved for the Bantu and Nilotic plantation slaves. ==References== Category:Slavery by country Category:Somali society Category:History of Somalia by topic Category:History of slavery Category:Slavery in Africa Category:Human rights abuses in Somalia ","title":"Slavery in Somalia"},{"id":"35347971","text":"Zucchetti () is an Italian company that produces software, hardware and services for companies, banks, insurances, professionals and trade associations. ==History== In 1977 Zucchetti Chartered accountant produces the first software in Italy for the automatic processing of tax return.

He was the first observer ace in No. 20 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to score a victory in the Bristol Fighter. ==Background== Melville Wells Waddington, son of Herbert Waddington (5 Nov 1867 ‚Äì 24 May 1919) and his wife Edna Judd Waddington, was born on 21 December 1895 in Toronto, Canada. At the time of the 1901 census, his family was living in Toronto, where they continued to reside in 1911. His father was an accountant and financier. Melville Waddington was reported to be a descendant of John Waddington of Hulme, Manchester. ==Military career== Melville Waddington served with the 12th Brigade Ammunition Column of the Canadian Field Artillery, receiving his commission in March 1916. He was found to be fit for the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force on 21 April 1916. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps on 16 April 1917, and was posted to No. 20 Squadron on 18 June 1917. He is credited with twelve aerial victories as an observer with No. 20 Squadron. The first seven were with F.E.2d aircraft, the last five with Bristol F.2b planes. All of his victories were against Albatros aircraft. On 29 June 1917, from F.E.2d (A6498), Lieutenant Waddington and his pilot Lieutenant Reginald Milburn Makepeace sent an Albatros D.V out of control over Houthem, Belgium. This was the observer's first aerial victory. He racked up his second on 6 July 1917, from F.E.2d (A6498) piloted by Second Lieutenant Malcolm McCall. They destroyed an Albatros D.V in flames over Comines. Lieutenant Waddington, as observer in F.E.2d (A6548), piloted by Harry George Ernest Luchford, sent two Albatros planes out of control on 17 July and 21 July 1917, the first over Polygon Wood between Ypres and Zonnebeke, West Flanders, Belgium, and the second over Menen, West Flanders. There is some disagreement as to whether those last two victories were against D.III or D.V aircraft. Waddington scored a double victory on 27 July 1917 from F.E.2d (A1956), again with pilot Luchford. They took down two Albatros D.V planes north of Menen, destroying one in flames and sending the other out of control. His remaining victories were all with Lieutenant Makepeace as pilot. On 16 August 1917, with Makepeace piloting F.E.2d (A3), Waddington racked up his seventh win. They sent an Albatros D.V out of control over Zonnebeke. By August 1917, No. 20 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was exchanging its F.E.2d aircraft for Bristol F.2b planes. On 3 September 1917, Lieutenant Waddington, with Lieutenant Makepeace as pilot, scored the first Bristol victory for No. 20 Squadron when, from A7214, they downed an Albatros D.V, which crashed between Menen and Werwicq. This was the eighth aerial victory for Waddington. Waddington and Makepeace scored four additional victories together, for a total of twelve for Waddington, five of those in Bristols. On 5 September 1917, from Bristol F.2b (A7203), they sent an Albatros D.V out of control west of Lille, France. This was the ninth victory for Waddington. His tenth was scored on 11 September 1917, from Bristol (A7214), when Waddington and Makepeace destroyed an Albatros D.V east of Menen. On 17 October 1917, they racked up a double victory (Waddington's eleventh and twelfth) when, from Bristol (A7255), they sent 2 Albatros D.Vs out of control, one over Zonnebeke and the other northeast of Zonnebeke. Waddington returned to Canada in February 1918, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, aboard the Saxonia. He served as an instructor, and on 14 August 1918 married Marjorie Jean Hill McLeod in Amherst, Nova Scotia. His occupation was listed as soldier. The London Gazette of 20 May 1919 announced that, on 31 March 1919, Lieutenant M. W. Waddington of the Royal Air Force, and Lieutenant of the Canadian Field Artillery, relinquished his commission on ceasing to be employed. This was also reported in the 29 May 1919 edition of Flight. ==After the war== According to aviation historian Norman Franks, Waddington was employed as a real estate and insurance salesman after the war. However, on four passenger lists from 1936, his occupation is recorded as accountant. On 14 August 1945, Waddington had a second heart attack and died. ==Gallery of aircraft== Image:Royal Aircraft Factory FE2b profile.jpgRoyal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 Image:Bristol F2B D8096 flying 1.jpgBristol F.2 Fighter Image:ZK-DVA2 IMG 3492-Edit.jpgAlbatros D.V ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:Royal Flying Corps officers Category:British World War I flying aces Category:Canadian Expeditionary Force soldiers Category:People from Old Toronto ","title":"Melville Waddington"},{"id":"35347983","text":"Franco Delli Colli (2 March 1929 ‚Äì 22 April 2004) was an Italian film cinematographer.

Thereafter, acetic acid is hydrogenated (presumably obtained by methane reforming) to give ethanol; a supported platinum-tin catalyst for this purpose was patented by Celanese. Starting from coal, it is gasified. Impurities such as mercury and cadmium are removed, before further reaction. Celanese claims to be able to produce hydrocarbon-based ethanol for a cost of $1.50 to $1.75 per gallon. ==Uses== TCX can function as a fuel additive to operate vehicles and in industrial- grade applications to manufacture paints, coatings, inks and pharmaceuticals.

After his arrest in 1982, he became a government witness and entered the witness protection program. Cullotta later became an author and a tour guide. ==Early years== Cullotta was born on December 14, 1938, in Chicago, Illinois to Josephine Montedore and Joseph Raymond Cullotta. Cullotta's father was also a criminal, although not connected with the Chicago Outfit. Cullotta dropped out of Steinmetz High School in the ninth grade, and started a criminal career together with boyhood friend Tony Spilotro, engaging in theft, burglary, and murder. In 1962, Cullotta killed William McCarthy and James Miraglia, murders he later admitted, who were found dead in the trunk of a car on May 14, 1962. McCarthy's head had been placed in a vise and his throat slashed, while Miraglia was strangled. In 1968, Cullotta was convicted of burglary and sentenced to eight years in prison. In 1972, he was paroled by the state, but was transferred to Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute to serve the federal portion of his sentence. After six months, he was transferred to a halfway house, ultimately being released in 1974. ==Hole in the Wall Gang== In early 1979, Cullotta moved to Las Vegas, Nevada to join Spilotro, who had already been there since 1971, and his group of experienced thieves, safecrackers, and killers. The crew became known in the media as the Hole in the Wall Gang because of its penchant for gaining entry to homes and buildings by drilling through the exterior walls and ceilings of the locations they burgled. On October 10, 1979, Cullotta killed his former friend and grand jury witness Sherwin \\"Jerry\\" Lisner in Las Vegas, who was suspected of informing on a money exchange scam he was working on with Cullotta. When he became a witness, Cullotta admitted he had killed Lisner, on orders from Tony Spilotro. On July 4, 1981, the Hole in the Wall Gang robbed Bertha's Gifts & Home Furnishings on East Sahara Avenue in Las Vegas. The robbery was a bust, as much of the gang was arrested, including Cullotta, Joe Blasko, Leo Guardino, Ernest Davino, Lawrence Neumann, and Wayne Matecki‚Äîeach charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, attempted grand larceny, and possession of burglary tools. In 1982, Cullotta was imprisoned again, and was approached by the FBI with a wiretap of Spilotro talking with someone about \\"having to clean our dirty laundry\\", which Cullotta took as an insinuated contract on his life. Due to this, in July 1982, Cullotta finalized an agreement with the prosecutors. In September 1983, Spilotro was indicted for conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the Lisner murder, and released on $100,000 bail. At a trial in October 1983, Cullotta admitted that he was involved in over 300 crimes, including four murders, perjury, robberies and burglaries. He also testified that Spilotro, his boss in Las Vegas, ordered him to make a telephone call that lured one of the 1962 murder victims, William McCarthy, to a fast food restaurant. Spilotro was acquitted later that year. Cullotta was given immunity for his previously uncharged crimes, but was sentenced to 10 years in prison, reduced to eight years after an outburst from Cullotta. He served two years at Metropolitan Correctional Center, San Diego, until he was paroled to the witness protection program in 1984, and placed on two years' probation. He spent two years under an assumed name in the program, moving around from time to time, including in Texas; Estes Park, Colorado; Biloxi and Gulfport, Mississippi; and Mobile, Alabama. ==Life after crime== Cullotta provided information for Nicholas Pileggi's 1995 book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas, which Martin Scorsese adapted into the 1995 film Casino. Cullotta inspired the character Frank Marino (played by Frank Vincent), served as a technical advisor for the film, and also played an on-screen role as a hitman. Cullotta co-authored two books with Dennis N. Griffin, Cullotta: The Life of a Chicago Criminal, Las Vegas Mobster, Government Witness (also with Dennis Arnoldy, 2007), and The Rise and Fall of a \\"Casino\\" Mobster: The Tony Spilotro Story Through a Hitman's Eyes (2017), and was involved in the making of several documentaries. Cullotta worked as a tour guide and a speaker for The Mob Museum in Las Vegas. In 2013, he told his story in an episode of Locked Up Abroad. Cullotta appeared in the season 5 premiere of Bar Rescue where he gave commentary to the Las Vegas bar he visited, Champagne's (formerly Champagne's Cafe). He also appeared during the bar's grand re- opening. In January 2020, Cullotta started a YouTube channel called \\"Coffee with Cullotta\\". == Death == On August 20, 2020, Cullotta died at the age of 81 in a Las Vegas hospital from complications related to COVID-19 and other medical issues. His death was also announced on his YouTube channel, \\"Coffee with Cullotta\\". ==References * - VladTV Category:1938 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century American criminals Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:Chicago Outfit mobsters Category:American people convicted of burglary Category:Writers from Chicago Category:American non-fiction crime writers Category:American mobsters of Italian descent Category:People who entered the United States Federal Witness Protection Program Category:Federal Bureau of Investigation informants Category:American Mafia cooperating witnesses Category:American writers of Italian descent Category:Organized crime memoirists Category:American memoirists Category:Non-fiction writers about organized crime in the United States Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Tour guides Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada Category:21st-century memoirists ","title":"Frank Cullotta"},{"id":"35348072","text":"Dolicholagus longirostris, the longsnout blacksmelt, is a species of deep-sea smelt found circumglobally in deep waters of the tropics and subtropics.

Upon successful completion of the program, prisoners who meet the necessary criteria are eligible for up to a 12-month reduction of their sentence and possibly six months in a halfway house depending on how many months they have left on their sentence. Due to the high demand and insufficient spots, inmates are placed on a waiting list typically when they have 12 months or less time left on their sentence and are accepted when there is an opening. This is part of the reason why inmates receive different amounts of time off their sentences. For example, if an inmate has waited for a slot until he has 12 months left and the program is six months long, then he only receives six months off his sentence and so forth. Michael Vick was rumored to have entered the program while serving out his sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas. Violent offenses normally disqualify defendants from the early release portion of the program. Felony or misdemeanor convictions for homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and child sexual abuses all render a prisoner ineligible to participate.28 C.F.R. ¬ß 550.55 (2016), available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/550.55 Bad behavior and regular rule breaking will definitely lead to expulsion from the Residential Drug Abuse Program http://rdapdan.com/services/qualify-for-rdap-program/ The program is open to inmates with a documented history of substance abuse in the 12-month period prior to arrest for the sentence they are currently serving.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. ==History== The first church in the village was built in 1246, and this was replaced by a new church on a different site in 1735. This was replaced again in 1825 on the site of the present church. This church was designed by the Kendal architect George Webster. As the size of the local population increased, the church became inadequate for its congregation, and in 1908 it was decided to demolish it and replace it with a larger building. The Lancaster architects Austin and Paley were commissioned to design the new church. The foundation stone was laid on 29 June 1909, and the new church was consecrated by the bishop of Carlisle on 7 November 1910. It provided seating for 259 people, and cost about ¬£5,000 (). ==Architecture== Exterior St Mark's is constructed in Lancaster sandstone and in stone from Darley Dale. It is roofed with green slate, and has a stone ridge. Its architectural style is late Decorated-early Perpendicular. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, north and south aisles, a south porch, a three-bay chancel with a vestry to the north, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages on a plinth with diagonal buttresses, and has a battlemented parapet, At the northeast corner of the tower is a stair turret, also battlemented, that rises higher than the tower. The windows on the sides of the church have two lights, the east window has five lights, and all are under pointed heads. Interior The porch leads into the base of the tower. Between the entrance and the font is a large round column, the south pier of the tower; the north pier is built into the wall. The arcades are carried on alternate round and octagonal piers, the capitals being decorated with carved square flowers. The altar rails, the stalls, the pulpit, the pews, and the font were all designed by Austin and Paley. The font is carved from a single piece of stone. The stained glass in the east window is a memorial to the Second World War; it was designed by Gerald E. R. Smith and made in the studio of A. K. Nicholson. In the south wall is a window designed for the Millennium by Sarah Sutton that depicts Adam lay ybounden. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Conacher of Huddersfield, and was partly rebuilt in 1987 by Holmes and Swift. Appraisal This was the last major village church to be designed by the practice before the death of Hubert Austin. It received praise from the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner who said it was \\"as good as any of the churches by the best church architects of those years, say Temple Moore\\". Assessing the plans for the Incorporated Church Building society in 1908 J Oldrid Scott and C. Hodgson Fowler stated \\"Highly approved\\". ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in South Lakeland *Listed buildings in Natland *List of works by George Webster *List of ecclesiastical works by Austin and Paley (1895‚Äì1914) ==References== Citations Sources * * * ==External links== *Visit Cumbria: with photographs of the church Category:Church of England church buildings in Cumbria Category:Diocese of Carlisle Category:Grade II* listed churches in Cumbria Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Cumbria Category:Austin and Paley buildings ","title":"St Mark's Church, Natland"},{"id":"35348171","text":"Odyssey Celeste Sims (born July 13, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Lynx of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).

He joined the Spanish Royal Army in his youth, attaining the ranks of Brigadier of the Infantry of the Royal Armies and Commander General of the presidio of St. Augustine. == Political Career == De Quesada was appointed Governor and intendant of Honduras in 1783, and remained in this office until 1789, when he was replaced in the Honduran government by Alejo Garc√≠a Conde. Photo of the Cathedral of St. Augustine, 1914. In 1790 De Quesada was appointed Governor of East Florida by Charles IV of Spain, to replace Vicente Manuel de C√©spedes. He assumed the governorship in July 1790, during the Nootka Sound Crisis. Upon his appointment, De Quesada wrote to George Washington informing the president of his new position in Florida and offering his diplomatic friendship to the United States. After his arrival at Saint Augustine, as a consequence of the Nootka Crisis, De Quesada revamped the defenses of the city, which were not extensive enough, according to him and his engineer, Mariano de la Roque. The garrison was small and dispirited, as the Spanish royal subsidy (situado) had not arrived in Florida since 1787. In the course of his service as governor of the province, De Quesada also obtained the titles of Vice Royal Patron, and Subdelegate of St. Augustine and the province. Construction of the Cathedral was begun in 1793 under his administration and finished in 1797, a year after he left his post.  Slavery  De Quesada banned the recognition of runaway slaves who had fled from the British colonies to Florida seeking freedom. He had corresponded with Thomas Jefferson in 1791 on the matter of fugitive slaves coming from the southern United States. Through commissioner James Seagrove of Georgia, De Quesada wrote a letter initiating the agreement that stated any American slaveowner immigrating to Florida simply had to swear that they were the legitimate owners of the enslaved person for their ownership to be recognized. == Death == He became ill in February 1796, and continued to serve as governor of East Florida only until March of that year, when he was succeeded by Bartolom√© Morales. He died in 1798. ==References== Category:1738 births Category:1798 deaths Category:Cuban politicians Category:Royal Governors of La Florida Category:Spanish colonial governors and administrators Category:Governors of Honduras ","title":"Juan Nepomuceno de Quesada"},{"id":"35348185","text":"Kulderzipken is a Flemish television series that premiered in 1995.

The bridge crossed the Swan River near Claise Brook and was built for passenger and freight traffic to Bunbury on the South Western Railway, and was also part of the Armadale railway line. The Bunbury Bridge (then called the Swan Bridge) was built in 1892 by Atkins and Law. Construction was delayed due to troubles with sinking the jarrah piles into the soft riverbed: they were intended to be sunk below the water level, but reached this depth under their own weight as soon as they were put in position. Ultimately, they had to be driven to before a solid footing was found.

In contrast to national or international Esperanto organizations, an Esperanto club usually limits its activities only to a certain city or region. Esperanto clubs have been forming the backbone of the Esperanto movement since the beginning of the movement, although recently the situation is starting to change due to the possibility of immediate and first-hand communication that is provided by the Internet. The first Esperanto club was founded in Nuremberg on 18 February 1885, before Esperanto was published (1887) ‚Äì originally it was a group of supporters of Volap√ºk, who in 1888 unanimously converted to Esperanto, under the influence of Leopold Einstein. The Nuremberg club was also the first to start publishing an Esperanto magazine, La Esperantisto. == Characteristics == Esperanto clubs may differ in a variety of ways: * Existence of a permanent meeting place; * Regularity and variety of activities; * Solid member base (and collection of membership fees); * Specialization in a certain level of Esperanto knowledge; * Specific interest in a topic behind Esperanto itself (e.g. Esperanto teachers club, students club, club of Esperanto-speaking paramedics, club linked to a science center etc.); * Relation to a national Esperanto organization (usually the local branch of the Universal Esperanto Association); * Regular organization of Esperanto language courses.  List of first Esperanto clubs  Following is a list of Esperanto clubs founded between 1887 and 1895, i.e. during the first nine years of Esperanto's existence (names of the founders are given in brackets):Zakrzweski, Adam: Historio de Esperanto. 1913, 144 pp. * 1888 ** Nuremberg (Christian Schmidt) * 1889 ** Moscow ** Sofia (Bogdanov) * 1890 ** Schalke (Trompeter) ** Ivanovo-Voznesensk (Antoni Grabowski) * 1891 ** Munich - \\"Societo E-isto-ja\\" = Internacia Klubo de Korespondado (L.

He resigned his seat effective August 20, 2015 after he pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the alleged embezzlement of more than $1.8 million from his former employer. ==Early life and career== Rick Brinkley attended Langston University, the Oral Roberts University School of Theology, and the Oklahoma State University School of Education. He was pastor of the Collinsville Community Church for ten years, and spent ten years working in television. He was the President/CEO of Eastern Oklahoma's Better Business Bureau from 1999 to 2011, and then its Chief Operating Officer. Brinkley was fired from Eastern Oklahoma's BBB in April 2015. ==Political career== Brinkley entered politics when he was elected in 2010 by Oklahoma's Senate District 34 to serve in the Oklahoma Senate. In the Senate, he was the Vice-Chair of the Finance Committee, and a member of the Appropriations, Business and Commerce, and Health and Human Services Committees, as well as the Sub-Committee on Education. As a member of the Senate, he voted in favor of repealing the state's income tax. He voted to define life as beginning at conception, and to require that physicians inform abortion patients of fetal heartbeat, but he failed to vote on a bill to impose restrictions on abortions. Brinkley was expected to succeed Sen. Brian Bingman as the next Oklahoma State Senate President Pro Tempore. Brinkley also introduced a \\"birther\\" bill that would require all candidates to prove their eligibility.Kirk Johnson, Evidence Aside, State Lawmakers Debate 'Birther' Bills, New York Times (April 21, 2011). Resignation and fraud conviction Brinkley, in August 2015, initially resigned his seat effective December 31, 2015, citing personal reasons. The resignation came as Brinkley was being investigated by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation on accusations of embezzlement from the Better Business Bureau of Tulsa where he had formerly served as Chief Operating Officer. At the time of his resignation he was being sued by the BBB, with the organization alleging in court filings that Brinkley used the money for \\"his mortgage, pool cleaner, personal credit card invoices, and to support a hidden gambling habit, in an amount believed to be in excess of $1,800,000.\\" Upon resigning, Brinkley entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in which he admitted to embezzling at least $1.8 million from the BBB and pleaded guilty to five counts of wire fraud and one count of filing a false income tax return. The embezzlement was related to Brinkley's gambling addiction. In March 2016, Brinkley was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison. He was also ordered to pay $1,829,033 in restitution to the BBB and $165,000 to the IRS.Randy Krehbiel, Former state Sen.

McHale was previously the assistant general manager of the Colorado Rockies in 1993, the president of the Detroit Tigers from 1995 to 2001, and chief operating officer of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays from 2001 to 2002. ==Early life and career== His father, John McHale, was a former major league baseball player and a longtime MLB executive with several organizations. His mother, Patty, is a member of the Briggs family that owned part or all of the Tigers franchise from 1919 to 1956.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&dat;=19950111&id;=NjRQAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=UFUDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5797,674452 Like his father, McHale was born in Detroit and also graduated from the University of Notre Dame, in 1971. At Notre Dame, he played defensive end and linebacker for the Fighting Irish under head coach Ara Parseghian. McHale received law degrees from Boston College Law School in 1975 and the Georgetown University Law Center in 1982. McHale attended Marist High School in Chamblee, Georgia, while his father was general manager of the Atlanta Braves. McHale practiced law in the Denver area from 1981 to 1991 before entering baseball. ==Colorado Rockies== As an attorney, McHale served on the board of the Denver Metropolitan MLB Stadium District. He negotiated a future stadium deal with Jerry McMorris, the owner and president of the Colorado Rockies. In October 1991, McHale was named executive vice president of baseball operations of the Rockies, which did not begin play until 1993. Just before that inaugural season, McHale was named executive vice president of operations. Baseball America notes that, in the latter role, McHale filled the role of an assistant general manager. During his time with the Rockies, McHale gained experience in the planning and financing of Coors Field, which would open to wide acclaim in 1995. ==Detroit Tigers== McHale joined the Detroit Tigers in 1995 as president and chief executive officer (CEO), taking over day-to-day franchise operations from team owner Mike Ilitch. It was a homecoming for McHale, who was a native Detroiter and lifelong Tigers fan. McHale inherited a staff including the general manager Joe Klein and the longtime manager Sparky Anderson. In 1995, McHale suspended Anderson when he refused to manage replacement players in spring training games during the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike. Klein, who had wanted Anderson fired and had the disadvantage of never before working with McHale, was eventually fired himself. Klein was replaced by the young general manager Randy Smith, who previously had worked with McHale when both were with the Colorado Rockies organization. Anderson, who eventually retired on his own accord following the 1995 season, recalled the situation as \\"dysfunctional\\", although he had faith in McHale. McHale's major task was to seek out a new stadium to replace the aging Tiger Stadium, which lacked many modern amenities and had some of the smallest annual attendance figures in baseball. McHale said that, without a new stadium, the Tigers would be forced to maintain low payroll for players, making it more difficult for them to compete against the big-market teams. The payroll limitations of the era eventually played a part in the departure of the popular team players Cecil Fielder and Travis Fryman.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1734&dat;=19960801&id;=ce4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=AFMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2209,2905716 In 1996, Detroit voters approved financing for a new downtown ballpark, with construction commencing in 1997. McHale was instrumental and successful in the planning and financing of the new stadium, Comerica Park, which opened in 2000. The new stadium paid off as the team hosted 2.35 million fans ‚Äì the second-highest total in team history.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat;=20061020&id;=SMoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=YSUEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5896,4186174 McHale, in an effort to attract and develop a strong pitching staff, had designed the field dimensions to make the park more pitcher-friendly, which was in contrast to the hitter-friendly dimensions of Tiger Stadium. This immediately drew the ire of Tigers' hitters and fans, with Tigers outfielder Bobby Higginson proclaiming it \\"Comerica National Park\\". The fences were eventually brought in following McHale's departure from the organization, although it continues to be placed near the top of all ballparks for triples. McHale accomplished his goal of a new ballpark, but along with GM Smith was unable to turn around the struggling Tigers. He left the Tigers organization in summer 2001, taking a job as the chief operating officer of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The Tigers' owner, Ilitch, once again assumed the title of team president and the Detroit Red Wings executive Jim Devellano, a longtime Ilitch employee, was named senior vice president of the Tigers. The president, CEO (and eventually GM) roles were assumed by Dave Dombrowski in late 2001. ==References * Category:Living people Category:Detroit Tigers executives Category:Tampa Bay Devil Rays executives Category:Colorado Rockies executives Category:Major League Baseball team presidents Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:Lawyers from Denver Category:American chief operating officers Category:American chief executives of professional sports organizations Category:Chief information officers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"John McHale Jr."},{"id":"35348584","text":"Niculescu-Mizil in 1966 Paul Niculescu-Mizil (; 25 November 1923 ‚Äì 5 December 2008) was a Romanian communist politician. Joining the Romanian Communist Party due to his background and intellectual aspirations, he was prominent in the agitprop department during Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's rule. Under Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, he went from handling foreign affairs in the late 1960s to holding ministerial posts in the 1970s to a marginal position in the 1980s. After the regime's collapse, he spent time in prison before emerging as a vocal defender of the system he had served. ==Biography== Propaganda and international affairs Born in Bucharest, Ilarion ≈¢iu, \\"A murit Paul Niculescu-Mizil\\", Jurnalul Na≈£ional, 7 December 2008; accessed 6 April 2012 Niculescu-Mizil was raised in a left-wing milieu, with both his parents being activists of the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR) and the Socialist Party of Romania (PS). His father, Gheorghe Niculescu-Mizil, was reportedly a shop assistant, trade unionist, and self-taught poet, known for contributing to PSDR and PS gazettes‚Äîfrom Rom√¢nia Muncitoare to Socialismul‚Äî, and eventually joining the outlawed Communist Party (PCdR or PCR). He was kept under surveillance by the secret police (Siguran≈£a Statului), was prosecuted during the famous Dealul Spirii Trial, and stood as a pro-communist candidate during the 1922 election.Ioni≈£ƒÉ, p.10-17 According to their official biographers, Gheorghe and his wife Eufrosina Cotor Niculescu-Mizil ran a PCdR meeting house during World War II, as opponents of the Ion Antonescu dictatorship.Ioni≈£ƒÉ, p.17 Paul Niculescu-Mizil was a student at the military officers' school in Ploie≈üti during the war, and right after the King Michael Coup, his unit was sent to help retake Northern Transylvania. Joining the Communist Party (later \\"Workers' Party\\", PMR) in 1945, that year he became head of the student association at the Commercial and Industrial Academy and editor of Tinere≈£ea newspaper. In 1951, he joined the editorial board of the magazine Lupta de ClasƒÉ. He taught at the ≈ûtefan Gheorghiu Academy from 1946 to 1950, and was deputy rector and rector there between 1950 and 1954. He entered the PMR's history institute in 1954, holding positions near the top. He was also on the faculty of the C. I. Parhon University, teaching Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. He joined the central committee of the PMR at the end of 1955, and would remain a member until 1989.Dobre, p.432 He headed the PMR's propaganda and agitation section between 1956 and 1965, where, as Leonte RƒÉutu's deputy, he was one of the few persons with access to the latter's house, and backed his strident attacks on Romanian culture. He played a key role in introducing national Stalinism to Romania and in ensuring the presence of a compliant intelligentsia. Bogdan Cristian Iacob, \\"Jdanovul Rom√¢niei\\" , 22, 27 January 2009; accessed 9 April 2012 While he and his colleague Pavel »öugui promoted a less rigid view of the party's role in culture than their predecessors, who included Mihail Roller, they nonetheless touted a form of communism that was, in the view of political scientist Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"arrogant, intransigent and suspicious of any revisionist heresy\\". Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"Sociologia comunismului\\", 22, 18 February 2002; accessed 9 April 2012 Until the death of Gheorghiu-Dej in 1965, he was a consistent supporter, and helped distance Romania from the Soviet Union beginning in 1964. That year, as part of this trend, he prepared a document on the problems of the global communist and workers' movement, officially adopted by the PMR. Also in 1964, he received one of several awards the regime bestowed upon him, the Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic, second class.Dobre, p.433 After leaving the propaganda section, he sat on the central committee's secretariat, supervising the party's sections for ideology and for international relations (1965‚Äì1972); on the executive committee (1965‚Äì1989); and on the permanent presidium (1969‚Äì1974). He began holding these positions several months after Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej died and Nicolae Ceau≈üescu came to power in March 1965, but as his loyalty‚Äîmanifested, for instance, during the purges of an older generation of party members in 1958‚Äì1960‚Äî, political skill and less rigid thinking meant he was probably slated for a promotion anyway, he felt less of a debt to Ceau≈üescu than others promoted by the new leader. He portrayed himself as an intellectual, and was viewed as one of the party's ideologues, indeed as its most prominent one after RƒÉutu was marginalized in 1965.Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism, p.176, 194. University of California Press, 2003, In February 1968, he headed the Romanian delegation to a meeting in Budapest that made preparations for the following year's International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties. There, he made a striking gesture, leaving the room in protest at Soviet attacks on Romania's position of defending the principle of equality and independence within the global communist movement, in particular Czechoslovakia's right to carry out the reforms of the Prague Spring. Ministerial posts, loss of power and post-communist course During Ceau≈üescu's years in power, he was Education Minister (1972‚Äì1976), Finance Minister (1978‚Äì1981), and deputy prime minister (1972‚Äì1981). He sat in the Great National Assembly from 1957 to 1961 and from 1965 to 1989, successively representing areas in Gala≈£i, Timi»ô, Arad, BacƒÉu and Satu Mare counties. From 1965 to 1969 he was on the leadership of the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union and of the National Committee for Defending Peace, and served as Romania's permanent representative to the Comecon from 1979. As Ceau≈üescu's rule, the economic, political and cultural excesses of which he openly criticized on several occasions, became more personal and his policies less predictable, Niculescu- Mizil gradually lost influence. He became a marginal figure in the 1980s, despite remaining on the executive committee. He headed Centrocoop, a cooperative union, from 1981 to 1989, and it was the start of his tenure there that marked his real diminution in power. Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, \\"Cine a fost Nicu Ceau≈üescu? (V) Ispita comunismului dinastic\\", Evenimentul Zilei, 5 October 2011; accessed 6 April 2012 After the fall of the communist regime in 1989, he was initially in the leadership of the National Salvation Front, but pressure from civil society groups quickly saw him ejected. He was arrested and sent to prison, accused of direct involvement in repressing revolutionary activities in Timi»ôoara and Bucharest, and was incarcerated until 1992. Accounts differ on what in fact occurred: one suggests he had no real power and could not influence events either way, one claims he opposed opening fire on demonstrators in Timi»ôoara, while another states he backed Ceau≈üescu's decision to use force.Dennis Deletant, Ceau≈üescu and the Securitate, p.376. M.E. Sharpe, Armonk, New York, 1995, Together with Ion Iliescu, who was marginalized during the 1970s, he was among the less dogmatic figures around Ceau≈üescu. In his last years, he actively attempted to justify the communist dictatorship for the national values he claimed it upheld. Alongside other top party activists, including Manea MƒÉnescu, ≈ûtefan Andrei and Dumitru Popescu, he promoted the idea of a break between the \\"Comintern\\" phase of the 1950s and the later national communism, allegedly patriotic and enlightened. Biografiile nomenklaturii , at the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and the Memory of the Romanian Exile site; accessed 6 April 2012 Although he sought to avoid what TismƒÉneanu calls the \\"police-state brutalities and asphyxiating dogmatism of a sclerotic ideology\\", his defense of the system ignored its classically Stalinist features such as censorship, the Securitate secret police and hyper-bureaucratic planning. Hence, it was situated within the same intellectual constraints as the Letter of the Six. He discussed the regime during numerous talk-show appearances, where he was countered by representatives of anti-communist civil society groups, and also published his memoirs. He died of heart disease and his body was displayed for public viewing at the Finance Ministry he once headed. This drew criticism from prominent members of the National Liberal Party against then-minister Varujan Vosganian, himself a Liberal. He was buried in Cernica following a Romanian Orthodox service.

Despite growth in services and passenger numbers the airline had after-tax losses of 14.53m dinars ($9.2m) in the first year of operation. In December 2012 an Airbus A330-200 lease contract was announced and the aircraft delivered in June 2013, eventually operating services to Montreal. These widebody operations came to an end in 2015 with the return of the aircraft to its lessor. On 15 January 2013 the airline ordered 3 Airbus A320neo and 3 A320ceo narrowbody aircraft, at a list price of some $600m and with delivery starting in 2015. These orders were cancelled in June and August 2015 respectively due to the airline's deteriorating financial situation. In July 2015, Syphax Airlines suspended all operations stating financial difficulties.ch-aviation.com - Financially ailing Syphax Airlines suspends operations 31 July 2015 However, the airline announced a resumption of services by September 2015 after sourcing new funding.ch-aviation.com - Tunisia's Syphax Airlines to resume operations this month 8 September 2015 In September 2018, it was announced the airline would restart operations in Spring 2019. Initially, the carrier would offer its two ex-Air Nostrum CRJ900ERs for wet-lease services during the Winter 2018/19 season, ahead of the launch of its own routes in March or April 2019. The carrier intends to connect Tunis, Djerba, and Sfax to destinations in North Africa and Europe, with Paris and Toulouse Blagnac floated as the first routes. The airline also intends to add narrowbody aircraft to further boost its network in the region and offer sixth-freedom services between Africa and Europe via Tunisia. In January 2019, the airline was granted a new Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) by the Tunisian Ministry of Transport. The certificate was issued on 3 January 2019 and is signed by Habib Mekki, the director general of civil aviation at the ministry. Syphax's founder, Mohamed Frikha, previously stated the company planned to soft-launch as a wet-lease operator once it received its AOC. The initial phase would see the airline's two Bombardier CRJ900s flown on behalf of an external partner in Africa. The wet-lease contract will bring in revenue while the airline finalises its own traffic rights ‚Äì a process that is expected to take about five months. Scheduled flights will then begin under the Syphax brand, with services planned from Tunis, Sfax and Djerba to Algeria, France, Italy and Spain. ==DestinationsFleet== Syphax Airlines Airbus A319-100 As of September 2018, the Syphax Airlines fleet includes the following aircraft: {  style=\\"border-collapse:collapse;text- align:center\\" +Syphax Airlines Fleet - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Aircraft !rowspan=\\"2\\"Total !rowspan=\\"2\\"Orders !colspan=\\"3\\"Passengers !rowspan=\\"2\\"Notes - !C !Y !Total - Bombardier CRJ-900ER -- 2 -- 90 90  - !Total !-- !2 !colspan=\\"4\\" } ==ReferencesCategory:Defunct airlines of Tunisia Category:Airlines established in 2011 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2015 Category:2011 establishments in Tunisia Category:Defunct companies of Tunisia *[C]: Business class *[Y]: Economy class ","title":"Syphax Airlines"},{"id":"35348592","text":"Miguel Robles (born December 7, 1987) is a national-record holding backstroke swimmer from Mexico.

Notable instances were: France 1715‚Äì1723 (under Philip, Duke of Orleans), Britain 1811‚Äì1820 (under George, Prince of Wales, Prince Regent)...\\" ruling, governing) is a person appointed to govern a state pro tempore (Latin: 'for the time being') because the regnant monarch is a minor, is absent, abdicated the throne, is incapacitated or dead, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the monarchy.Oxford English Dictionary The rule of a regent or regents is called a regency. A regent or regency council may be formed ad hoc or in accordance with a constitutional rule. Regent is sometimes a formal title granted to a monarch's most trusted advisor or personal assistant. If the regent is holding his position due to his position in the line of succession, the compound term prince regent is often used; if the regent of a minor is his mother, she is often referred to as queen regent or empress dowager. If the formally appointed regent is unavailable or cannot serve on a temporary basis, a may be appointed to fill the gap. In a monarchy, a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons, but may also be elected to rule during the interregnum when the royal line has died out. This was the case in the Kingdom of Finland and the Kingdom of Hungary, where the royal line was considered extinct in the aftermath of World War I. In Iceland, the regent represented the King of Denmark as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1795), kings were elective, which often led to a fairly long interregnum. In the interim, it was the Roman Catholic primate (the archbishop of Gniezno) who served as the regent, termed the (Latin: ruler 'between kings' as in ancient Rome). In the small republic of San Marino, the two captains regent, or , are elected semi-annually (they serve a six-month term) as joint heads of state and of government. Famous regency periods include that of the Prince Regent, later George IV of the United Kingdom, giving rise to many terms such as Regency era and Regency architecture. Strictly this period lasted from 1811 to 1820, when his father George III was insane, though when used as a period label it generally covers a wider period. Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans was Regent of France from the death of Louis XIV in 1715 until Louis XV came of age in 1723; this is also used as a period label for many aspects of French history, as in French, again tending to cover a rather wider period than the actual regency. The equivalent Greek term is (), meaning overseer. Liechtenstein (under Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein) is the only country with an active regency. ==Other uses== Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse in Haarlem, Frans Hals, 1664 The term regent may refer to positions lower than the ruler of a country. The term may be used in the governance of organisations, typically as an equivalent of \\"director\\", and held by all members of a governing board rather than just the equivalent of the chief executive. Some university managers in North America are called regents and a management board for a college or university may be titled the \\"Board of Regents\\" . In New York State, all activities related to public and private education (P-12 and postsecondary) and professional licensure are administered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, the appointed members of which are called regents. The term \\"regent\\" is also used for members of governing bodies of institutions such as the national banks of France and Belgium. In the Dutch Republic, the members of the ruling class, not formally hereditary but forming a de facto patrician class, were informally known collectively as regenten (the Dutch plural for regent) because they typically held positions as \\"regent\\" on the boards of town councils, as well as charitable and civic institutions. The regents group portrait, regentenstuk or regentessenstuk for female boards in Dutch, literally \\"regents' piece\\", is a group portrait of the board of trustees, called regents or regentesses, of a charitable organization or guild. This type of group portrait was popular in Dutch Golden Age painting during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the Dutch East Indies, a regent was a native prince allowed to rule de facto colonized 'state' as a regentschap (see that term). Consequently, in the successor state of Indonesia, the term regent is used in English to mean a bupati, the head of a kabupaten (second level local government). Again in Belgium and France (r√©gent in French, or in Dutch), \\"regent\\" is the official title of a teacher in a lower secondary school (junior high school), who does not require a college degree but is trained in a specialized √©cole normale (normal school). In the Philippines specifically, the University of Santo Tomas the Father Regent, who must be a Dominican priest and is often also a teacher, serves as the institution's spiritual head. They also form the Council of Regents that serves as the highest administrative council of the university. In the Society of Jesus, a regent is an individual training to be a Jesuit and who has completed his novitiate and philosophy studies, but has not yet progressed to theology studies. A regent in the Jesuits is often assigned to teach in a school or some other academic institution as part of the formation toward final vows. ==See also== *Interregnum queen *Queen mother *Empress dowager *Queen dowager *List of regents *Regency Acts *Viceroy, an individual who, in a colony or province, exercised the power of a monarch on his behalf ==References== Category:Heads of state Category:Titles Category:Monarchy ","title":"Regent"},{"id":"35348637","text":"Alabama Monument Joseph Walker Urner (January 16, 1898 - 1987) American sculptor, painter and etcher born in Frederick, Maryland.

In addition to those shown over WGN-TV within the Chicago market, game telecasts produced by the station were also syndicated to television stations in other parts of Illinois as well as portions of Indiana and Iowa that are within the respective broadcast territories of the contracted teams. WGN-TV wound down its broadcasts of team-based sports programming between March and September 2019, beginning with the conclusion of Bulls and Blackhawks game coverage that spring, as the four professional teams prepared to make their game telecasts cable-exclusive (with the Cubs planning to move their telecasts to Marquee Sports Network upon its launch on February 22, 2020, and the Bulls, Blackhawks and White Sox relegating their local television broadcasts to existing regional sports network partner NBC Sports Chicago beginning with the Bulls' 2019‚Äì20 preseason schedule), thereby ending the Chicago market's distinction as the only remaining American media market to regularly offer over-the-air telecasts of sporting events from NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball teams. Amidst this hiatus, in February 2020, Chicago Fire FC (MLS) announced a multi-year agreement with WGN-TV to transfer their over-the-air telecasts to the station beginning with its 2020 season, returning regular sporting events to the station after a seven-month lag. ==History== Throughout its history, WGN-TV has had a long-standing association with Chicago sports. The station has been noted for being one of a handful of commercial television stations in the United States‚Äîand, from the early 2000s until 2019, the only such station‚Äîto maintain a substantial schedule of locally originated telecasts from multiple major professional sports franchises. WGN is also among the few local television stations to have regularly carried events from teams in any of the five major sports leagues that have historically contracted their games for over-the-air broadcast well into the 21st century, even as professional sports franchises migrated most or all of their locally originated game telecasts to regional sports networks that require a subscription to a multichannel television provider (including cable, satellite, IPTV and fiber-optic-based services) to receive, citing the hefty rights fees those services pay for the contractual rights that factor as major drivers of league and team revenue. Each of the city's major professional sports franchises, along with several area collegiate teams, have had their games regularly televised over channel 9. The one exception is the Chicago Bears, who, like other NFL franchises, are bound by network broadcasting contracts by the National Football League for the most part, though most teams license some of their preseason games for regional over-the- air broadcast through in-house syndication units; although the Bears' cable- originated games have occasionally aired on WGN-TV by arrangement with ESPN under NFL provisions pertaining to national cable telecasts within a franchise's home market. Chicago Cubs baseball WGN-TV's respective relationships with Chicago's two Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises, the Chicago Cubs (of the National League) and the Chicago White Sox (of the American League), trace back to shortly before the station's inception in April 1948. Coverage of baseball games involving the Chicago Cubs has perhaps typified WGN-TV's programming identity, due to the popularity of the telecasts both locally and, as a superstation, throughout the Midwestern United States. On March 7 of that year, Channel 9 acquired the local television rights to broadcast all of the Cubs's daytime home games at Wrigley Field during the 1948 season, beginning with the team's April 23 game, in which the Cubs were set to play against the St. Louis Cardinals. (The Cubs would not hold nighttime games at Wrigley Field until April 1988, when it became the last MLB club to begin holding games after sunset.) The team's broadcast partnership with the Cubs owes itself to sister radio station WGN (720 AM)'s longtime role as the flagship of the team's radio network that dates to 1924 (when the Chicago Tribune acquired the station from Zenith-Edgewater Beach Broadcasting) and would last until 2014. The station aired its inaugural sports telecast on April 16, two weeks after WGN-TV signed on, involving an exhibition rivalry game between the Cubs and the White Sox (which the Sox won, 4-1). WGN-TV shared the local telecast rights to the Cubs with WBKB-TV (channel 4, now CBS owned-and-operated station WBBM-TV on channel 2) until 1951, with Channel 9 gaining exclusive rights to the Cubs broadcasts starting in 1952. Jack Brickhouse, the longtime sports director‚Äîand later, vice president of sports programming‚Äîfor the WGN television and radio stations, handled play-by-play announcing duties for the home games of both teams until 1967, and continued to call Cubs games until his retirement from broadcasting in 1981. Combining his relationships with both the Cubs and White Sox, Brickhouse called over 5,000 baseball games during his career, sharing the booth with announcers such as Milo Hamilton, Lou Boudreau, Vince Lloyd (who also served as a sports anchor for WGN-TV) and Lloyd Pettit (who also served as a WGN-TV news and sports anchor during the timeframe). The station's relationship with the Cubs was further cemented on June 16, 1981, when the Tribune Company (renamed Tribune Media in August 2014 following the spin-off of its publishing division) purchased an 81% share in the franchise from William Wrigley Jr. ‚Äì who sold the franchise to alleviate himself of the large estate taxes that were accrued upon inheriting the team following the death of his parents ‚Äì for $20.5 million. The sale was approved in a unanimous vote among the National League team owners on August 6 of that year. The purchase made Tribune the second operator of a superstation to own an MLB franchise (alongside Ted Turner, who owned the Atlanta Braves, which aired its games over his Atlanta independent WTBS) and one of three companies that owned television stations in the home markets of the teams they owned (along with Gene Autry, who then owned the California Angels and Los Angeles independent [and eventual WGN-TV sister station] KTLA in Los Angeles). (Detroit Tigers owner John Fetzer also owned television and radio stations in the Midwest during his ownership of the team from 1956 to 1983; however, none were based within the Detroit market.) With the retirement of Brickhouse after the 1981 season, longtime announcer Harry Caray was dispatched from the South Side to replace him as the Cubs' lead television voice, under an initial two-year deal with the WGN television and radio stations. The decision to move most of the White Sox's game telecasts to over-the-air pay television led to his decision to switch team play-by-play allegiances, as the limited exposure that the Sox would experience as a result of having the majority of games available over Sportsvision (which required a set-top descrambler box to receive the signal) would limit the team's television accessibility. For the next 16 years, primarily working with analyst Steve Stone, Caray further established his place among Chicago's most-beloved personalities. Like Brickhouse, Caray was known for displaying an unapologetic, home team-oriented enthusiasm to his game calls, punctuated with memorable signature catchphrases for big plays (such as Caray's \\"Holy Cow!\\" and Brickhouse's \\"Hey-hey!\\"). Caray also brought his unique rendition of \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" during the seventh- inning stretch to the channel 9 broadcast booth. With WGN-TV's emerging prominence as a national superstation during the 1980s and 1990s, Caray's fan base ‚Äì and that of the Cubs ‚Äì grew beyond Chicago and the Midwestern U.S. into other parts of the country. On August 7, 2001, WGN-TV aired its first sports broadcast and the Chicago market's first live locally originated telecast to be presented in high definition, involving a regular season game between the Cubs and the Colorado Rockies; beginning with the 2004 Cubs and White Sox seasons, the station began broadcasting most Cubs, White Sox and Bulls home games in high definition. On August 22, 2009, the Tribune Company transferred a controlling 95% interest in the team and its 25% stake in regional sports network Comcast SportsNet Chicago (now NBC Sports Chicago) to Thomas S. Ricketts (son of TD Ameritrade founder J. Joseph Ricketts) in a leveraged partnership arrangement ‚Äì designed to prevent Tribune, which was in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings due to the $13 billion in debt it accrued through Sam Zell's 2007 buyout and subsequent privatization of the company, from incurring taxes in an outright sale ‚Äì for $845 million. Tribune continued to maintain a 5% interest in the Cubs as part of a 10-year partnership to satisfy IRS issues concerning the deal; on January 25, 2019, Tribune sold off the minority share to Ricketts-owned parent company Chicago Entertainment Ventures, LLC for $107.5 million. On November 5, 2013, the Cubs exercised an option to opt out of their television contract with WGN-TV ‚Äì which was originally set to end in 2022 ‚Äì following the 2014 season, with the intent of seeking a higher-value deal for the next five-year contractual period. As part of the opt-out clause exercise, the team gave the station a 30-day window to make a counteroffer for a deal that would last through the 2019 season (which, in any instance, would raise the rights fees that WGN pays the team from an annual rate of $20 million, and align the contract with the end of the team's cable rights deal). On January 7, 2014, as part of a four- year contract with the station, WGN-TV announced that it would air a reduced slate of 45 Cubs games per season beginning in 2015; the remaining share of over-the-air broadcasts, totaling 25 games per season, would air on ABC-owned WLS-TV (channel 7), which acquired partial broadcast rights to those games on December 12, 2014. Chicago White Sox baseball On March 9, 1948, two days after the station signed its initial broadcast contract with the Cubs, WGN-TV signed a separate agreement with the Chicago White Sox to carry a package of daytime and evening games held at Comiskey Park, including all 21 nighttime games that were scheduled for the 1948 season, originally set to take effect with the April 20 season opener against the Detroit Tigers. For the 1962 season, WGN-TV would occasionally cover the Cubs and White Sox games occurring simultaneously, using the respective announcing staffs for both teams, which used \\"bingo\\" as a signal to other announcers to switch to coverage of the other ongoing game. When the Sox telecast rights came up for renewal in the spring of 1966, WGN-TV management rejected the Sox's offer to carry up to 162 games per year (amounting to a full season) during the next contractual period, due to the scheduling conflicts that airing such a large game schedule would pose with its Cubs telecasts. (At the time, WGN was contracted to air a minimum of 86 Cubs games per season under an existing two-year contract.) As a result, on November 9, 1966, the Sox struck a five-year deal with Field Communications-controlled UHF independent WFLD-TV (channel 32, now a Fox owned-and-operated station) to televise the team's full slate of home and away games starting in 1968. Those rights were passed onto WSNS-TV (channel 44, now a Telemundo owned-and-operated station), as a result of then-owner Essaness Television Corporation signing a one-year agreement on August 3, 1972, that would see the competing independent acquire a package of at least 144 White Sox regular season games, beginning with the team's 1973 schedule. Although WSNS-TV had exclusivity over the White Sox telecasts, WGN maintained an outsourcing agreement with that station, under which Channel 9 handled production responsibilities for the games on behalf of WSNS. Around this time, White Sox broadcaster Harry Caray joined the WGN family, occasionally acting as a substitute sports anchor for its evening newscasts for most of the 1970s. In December 1980, Channel 9 signed a partial broadcasting agreement with White Sox, which confined its game telecasts to the team's road games‚Äîa reduced schedule of 60 games‚Äîfor the 1981 season. The initial deal would have resulted in Cablevision (which had provided cable television service to the Chicago suburbs of Homewood and Oak Park by that time) broadcasting most of the team's home games through a production agreement with its SportsChannel production unit. Team co-owner Jerry Reinsdorf (a Chicago-area attorney and real estate investor) scuttled the Cablevision deal shortly after he and Eddie Einhorn assumed ownership of the team from Bill Veeck in December 1981, allowing WGN- TV to carry an additional slate of home games. (Sportschannel subsequently filed a breach of contract lawsuit against the White Sox as a result, with the new White Sox ownership contending that the original agreement was not binding for the 1982 season as contended by Cablevision.) Former WGN Sports logo, used from November 11, 2002 to May 15, 2017. Dissatisfied with the licensing fees it was receiving for the WGN telecasts, however, Reinsdorf and Einhorn (the latter being a former president of CBS Sports and founder of the defunct TVS Television Network syndicated sports service) decided to move the White Sox's telecasts to Sportsvision, a joint venture between the Reinsdorf‚ÄìEinhorn partnership and Fred Eychaner, owner of upstart independent WPWR-TV (channel 60, now a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station on channel 50) through parent Metrowest Corporation. As Chicago was one of the last major metropolitan areas in the U.S. that had yet to be fully wired for cable television service, WPWR ‚Äì which operated as a timeshare with HATCO-60-owned Spanish-language independent WBBS-TV (now UniM√°s owned-and-operated station WXFT-DT and sole occupant of channel 60) ‚Äì would cede most of its broadcast day (running from 7:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.) to the subscription sports service, offering a mix of nighttime games from the White Sox and other local professional sports teams (including the Bulls and the Blackhawks); some of Sportsvision's Sox broadcasts were also simulcast over companion pay service ONTV (carried at the time over WSNS) and were also contracted out to WFLD to maintain free over- the-air coverage. (Due to low subscriber rates and resulting financial losses, Sox ownership sold Sportsvision to a venture of Cablevision Program Enterprises and The Washington Post Company in December 1983. The service, which evolved into SportsChannel Chicago in 1989, would move exclusively to cable on Cablevision's suburban Chicago systems in January 1984; Sportsvision's over-the-air sports rights were transferred to ONTV around this time.) With Harry Caray moving to Cubs play-by-play duties and Jimmy Piersall moving to Sportsvision as its pre- and post-game show host, the team hired former major league players Don Drysdale (who previously served as commentator for the California Angels and ABC Sports) and Ken Harrelson to helm the Sox broadcast booth for the 1982 season. The Sox's eight-year tenure on WFLD ended in acrimony, with WFLD management filing a lawsuit accusing the team of mismanagement that resulted in declining game viewership and profit losses on the contract as well as breached advertising agreements with local auto dealership collective Chicagoland Dodge Dealers. As part of an out-of-court settlement between Sox ownership and WFLD, on September 14, 1989, the Reinsdorf ownership group signed a five-year agreement with WGN-TV to carry a minimum of 45 White Sox games per year, beginning with the 1990 season. Because of reductions to the team's local over-the-air broadcast schedule (due to shares of its game telecasts being split with regional and national cable sports networks and Major League Baseball's broadcast network partners) predating the Sox's third run on Channel 9, since the White Sox returned to the station in 1990, the number of White Sox games shown on the station had decreased to anywhere between 30 and 40 per season. Chicago Bulls basketball In August 1966, WGN-TV signed an agreement with the Chicago Bulls to broadcast games involving the upstart NBA franchise under a five-year agreement beginning with the 1966‚Äì67 season, beginning with an initial slate of up to twelve away games for the team's inaugural season. In the spring of 1972, the Bulls signed a three-year agreement with WSNS-TV to broadcast Bulls basketball games beginning with the 1973‚Äì74 season. The team returned to WGN for the 1976‚Äì77 season, running on the station for an additional eight seasons. Jack Brickhouse, Lorn Brown, Milo Hamilton and Bob Costas were among those assigned to work as Bulls play-by-play announcers for the WGN telecasts, with Johnny \\"Red\\" Kerr serving as an analyst. In the fall of 1984, the Bulls signed an agreement with WFLD to broadcast the team's games for four years, effective with the 1985‚Äì86 season. In connection with the out-of-court settlement between WFLD station management and the White Sox, through the same agreement signed on September 14, 1989 that resulted in that station also re- acquiring the local television rights to the Sox, the Bulls (which Reinsdorf ‚Äì as part of Chicago Professional Sports Limited Partnership, a 23-member majority shareholder group that acquired portions of its 56% share of the team from shares owned by, among others, the estate of longtime owner Arthur M. Wirtz and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner ‚Äì bought in March 1985 for an estimated $9.2 million) announced that it would move its local television broadcasts back to WGN-TV under a five-year deal, beginning with the 1989‚Äì90 season. The return of the Bulls to WGN-TV was a major boon for the station, as it overlapped with the seven-season NBA championship dynasty that flourished during Michael Jordan's tenure with the team. Chicago Blackhawks hockey Channel 9 originally served as the broadcast home for the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks from 1961 until 1975. Blackhawks broadcasts on WGN-TV were limited to away games, as then-owner Bill Wirtz had prohibited local coverage of his team's home games out of concern that televising those matches within the Chicago market could negatively impact ticket sales. (Televised Blackhawks road games were subsequently carried on WFLD from 1975 to 1978, and then shifted to WSNS-TV from 1978 to 1980.) After he inherited the team from his father following the elder Wirtz's death in September 2007, Rocky Wirtz decided to end the longstanding embargo on local home game telecasts. On March 30, 2008, the Blackhawks announced three-year broadcasting agreements with Channel 9 and Comcast SportsNet Chicago that would allow both broadcasters to carry a divided schedule of the team's home and away games beginning with the 2008‚Äì09 season. The WGN deal marked the first time that the Blackhawks broadcast any of their games on a Chicago-area broadcast television station (outside of occasional network broadcasts), since their away games were carried on the Sportsvision and ONTV subscription services between 1982 and 1985. Since the start of the initial contract during the 2008‚Äì09 campaign, WGN-TV has carried between 20 and 25 Blackhawks games per season. On February 15, 2011, it was announced that the team had renewed their broadcast contract with WGN-TV for five additional years through the 2015‚Äì16 NHL season. Chicago Fire FC soccer On February 19, 2020, WGN-TV announced a multi- year agreement with Chicago Fire FC, awarding it the exclusive local broadcast rights to the franchise's Major League Soccer games as well as a monthly series featuring interviews and profiles of Fire players, coaches and fans; the initial 2020 season broadcast schedule will encompass 24 regular season matches, 18 of which will air in prime time. (The remaining ten televised Fire games will air on the MLS's national broadcast partners, ABC, ESPN, FS1, Univision and UniM√°s, the latter of which will air locally via O&Os; WGBO-DT [channel 66] and WXFT-DT [channel 60], respectively; all WGN-televised Fire matches will also be streamed nationally via ESPN+.) The first Fire telecast to air on the station was an early-afternoon away game against the New England Revolution on March 7. (The inaugural season of Fire broadcasts on Channel 9 was quickly abbreviated due to the MLS's March 12 decision to suspend its 2020 regular season amid health concerns raised by the coronavirus pandemic.) Other sporting events Professional sports WGN-TV also aired game telecasts featuring other professional sports teams that have since relocated from Chicago or have folded completely, including the Chicago Spurs of the National Professional Soccer League (from 1966 until 1967, when the NPSL's merger with the United Soccer Association to form the North American Soccer League led to the Spurs being relocated to Kansas City to alleviate competition with the consolidated league's existing Chicago Mustangs soccer club), original Chicago NBA expansion franchise Chicago Packers/Zephyrs (from 1961 until 1963, when the franchise moved to Baltimore as the Baltimore Bullets) and the Chicago Fire of the World Football League (from 1974 to 1975, after which owner Thomas Origer folded the team amid its injury-traced poor performance during the second half of its sole season). WGN-TV carried select regular season NFL games involving the Chicago Bears and the now-defunct Chicago Cardinals via DuMont during the 1951 NFL season; following that, the Bears and Cardinals moved their telecasts to ABC ‚Äì and by association, ABC O&O; WBKB-TV (now WLS-TV) ‚Äì under a limited contract that lasted until CBS gained primary rights to both teams as part of a league-wide television package in 1956. In November 2010, WGN-TV became the home for preseason and regular season games involving the Bears ‚Äì the latter originally consisting of NFL Network Thursday Night Football simulcasts ‚Äì that are not carried by a broadcast network. (Under NFL broadcasting rules, games that are televised on the league's national cable partners are required to be simulcast over a local broadcast station in the home markets of the participating teams.) This marked the first time that Channel 9 had broadcast games from all five of Chicago's legacy professional sports teams during the course of a single season; the Bears simulcasts were not carried on WGN America due to conflicts that would be incurred with the NFL Network telecasts. Among the Bears games shown on the station were simulcasts of ESPN-televised Monday Night Football broadcasts (including match-ups against the Dallas Cowboys on October 1, 2012, and against the Washington Redskins on September 23, 2019). In those cases, although ABC-owned WLS-TV has right of first refusal to MNF simulcasts as its corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, holds majority ownership of ESPN, WLS management elected to exercise the station's right of first refusal over the game telecasts to avoid preempting ABC's live Monday night broadcast of Dancing with the Stars. Collegiate, semi-professional and amateur sports Along with Major League Baseball telecasts, WGN-TV's initial sports lineup included a Saturday night wrestling program produced by National Wrestling Alliance promoter Fred Kohler, Wrestling From Marigold, originating from the Marigold Gardens arena in downtown Chicago. Presided by play-by-play announcer Jack Brickhouse and commentator Vince Lloyd, WGN co-produced the program for national broadcast on the DuMont Television Network, which aired the program from September 1949 until March 1955, during the station's tenure as a DuMont affiliate. (WGN-TV continued to air Wrestling from Marigold as a local program until its cancellation by Channel 9 in 1957.) From 1948 until 1994, WGN also carried college basketball and football games from universities around the region (including the Illinois Fighting Illini, the Northwestern Wildcats, the DePaul Blue Demons, the Loyola Ramblers and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish). From 1966 to 1991, the station also carried a package of college football and basketball games involving teams in the Big Ten Conference; WGN also aired coverage of high school football games involving teams in the Chicago Public High School League from 1958 to 1979 and the Chicago College All-Star Game from 1948 to 1976. The station's coverage of Little League Baseball games during the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s was noted for the innovation of the center field camera angle now commonplace in baseball coverage. First utilized by the station in 1951, during Little League games held at Thillens Stadium, the angle ‚Äì which allowed for clear views of pitch movement, action between the pitcher and the batter, and more effective close-ups than were capable with the then-standard overhead shot from behind- the-plate at upper deck ‚Äì was used for those telecasts due to the smaller size of the stadium and the lack of a suitable place to place a camera behind the plate. The angles were later used for Cubs game coverage and was quickly adopted for local and national baseball telecasts by other professional and collegiate broadcasters. Horse racing WGN-TV has also held broadcast rights to the Illinois Derby, Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap and Arlington Million (except in years NBC Sports carried coverage as part of the Road to the Breeders' Cup) horse races. During the years leading up to the programming separation of WGN-TV and now-former national feed WGN America, the Illinois Derby and Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap telecasts were shown exclusively over the Chicago area signal. The restrictions did not apply to the Arlington Million, which continues to be simulcast on WGN America in selected years, even after the 2014 removal of Chicago-originated sports programming from its lineup, as one of two international-stature sporting events produced by Tribune Broadcasting properties to air on the channel (coverage of the Los Angeles Marathon from sister station KTLA being the other). In years which NBC Sports does not cover the Arlington Million as part of Road to the Breeders' Cup, WGN America carries the national simulcast, since the winner obtains an automatic bid to the Breeders' Cup Turf. ==Broadcast rights issues== When permitted under its contracts, WGN America occasionally aired national simulcasts of WGN's sports programming, mostly Cubs, White Sox and Bulls games. Baseball and basketball telecasts on WGN-TV and other superstations began raising the ire of Major League Baseball and NBA management during the 1980s and early 1990s, amid concerns over those broadcasts undercutting the value of broadcast contracts with other national broadcast and cable networks. The station's telecasts also ran into contractual restrictions after WGN became a charter affiliate of The WB in January 1995. Restrictions similar to those that affected WGN America‚Äîas well as the absence of contractual streaming rights‚Äîalso prevent WGN-TV from running sports highlights during live streams of the station's newscasts on the WGNTV.com website (unusual since some stations, including a few of WGN-TV/WGN America's Tribune-owned sister stations, have had permission to run sports highlights during live streams of local newscasts on their websites and mobile applications), which are substituted with a disclaimer screen denoting the restrictions that runs in place of the sports segment's video feed and accompanied by the audio portion of the segment. Airtime leasing agreements Following its launch in January 1993, WGN-TV began leasing airtime on sister cable news channel Chicagoland Television (CLTV) to carry a limited number of live Chicago Cubs game telecasts that were prohibited from airing on the station due to Major League Baseball's national television contracts at the time with CBS and ESPN. (The first WGN-leased game on CLTV, which provided supplementary local cable coverage to the team's existing agreement with SportsChannel Chicago, was an exhibition game against the Seattle Mariners on March 21, 1993. CLTV also offered late-night replays of afternoon Cubs games from the previous gameday.) Additional games would be transferred to CLTV beginning with the 1998 season, in order to comply with contractual limits imposed by The WB (which began offering its programming over WGN upon the network's January 11, 1995 launch) on the number of network program preemptions, other than those caused by long- form breaking news coverage, that could occur on an annual basis. The move substantially reduced the number of games shown on WGN-TV from 144 games in 1997 to 92 games in 1998, with 62 additional WGN-contracted games being placed on CLTV and a select number of additional games originally set to air on CLTV also being shifted to WGN. As a result, although it continued to air some weekday games during network prime time hours periodically, Channel 9 shifted to showing the majority of scheduled sports broadcasts on weekday and weekend afternoons, weekday late evenings (in the case of games held in the West Coast after network programming ended locally) and weekend evenings. (During situations when WGN was scheduled to air sports broadcasts in place of network programs from The WB and, from 2006 to 2016, The CW, WGN-TV rebroadcast the sports-displaced network shows on a tape-delayed basis later in the week, usually in a weekend evening timeslot not occupied by a scheduled game telecast, as neither The WB nor The CW has ever aired prime time programs on Saturdays and as The CW had embargoed providing programs on Sundays from September 2009 until October 2018). Beginning in 1999, CLTV also added a slate of overflow games produced for Fox Sports Net Chicago, which would also offer the games over proprietary overflow channel Fox Sports Net Chicago Plus (which aired the games in place of CLTV in area suburbs served by a cable provider that did not offer the news channel on their lineup).Confirmed by WGN-TV Chicago Professional Sports L.P. & WGN Continental Broadcasting Co. vs. National Basketball Association. 961 Fed. 2d 667 (7th Cir. 1992) On July 8, 1999, Tribune Broadcasting entered into a leasing arrangement with Weigel Broadcasting, under which the latter's flagship independent station, WCIU-TV (channel 26, now a CW affiliate), would carry a select number of Cubs, White Sox and Bulls games‚Äîa cumulative average of 40 telecasts each year involving the three teams‚Äîthat would be produced by WGN Sports for exclusive broadcast within the Chicago market, starting with the 1999‚Äì2000 Bulls season. (The WCIU telecasts were branded under the \\"CubsNet,\\" \\"SoxNet\\" and \\"BullsNet\\" umbrellas until 2004, when WGN began marketing the telecasts under the brand \\"WGN Sports on The U\\". CLTV would continue to air select games not covered by the WCIU agreement until 2002.) On February 19, 2015, Weigel terminated its agreement with Tribune to carry WGN-produced Cubs and White Sox telecasts, in an effort to limit scheduling conflicts with WCIU's then-recently launched early-prime time newscast (produced through a news share agreement with WLS-TV); the WGN- leased overflow broadcasts were moved to WPWR-TV ‚Äì airing under the brand \\"WGN Sports on My50\\" ‚Äì beginning with the 2015 Cubs and White Sox seasons. The sub- licensing agreements as well as the splintering of the team's telecast rights with regional cable sports networks ‚Äì Fox Sports Net Chicago (later FSN Chicago) from 1999 until 2003 and then Comcast SportsNet Chicago/NBC Sports Chicago beginning in 2004 ‚Äì resulted in the number of Cubs games produced by WGN-TV gradually decreasing in recent years (down to 70 per season by 2008). (Until the Fox Sports Chicago deal, the Cubs were the last Major League Baseball franchise that did not have local broadcast contracts with both cable and broadcast television outlets.) As a result of its decision to exempt the station from a renewed affiliation agreement involving the group's 12 other CW-affiliated stations dating to the network's 2006 founding with CW managing partner CBS Corporation, on May 23, 2016, Tribune announced that WGN-TV would convert into an independent station effective September 1. This would allow WGN-TV to increase the amount of sports programming that it could air during the calendar year (albeit, with far fewer televised games for each of the contracted teams than it had previously been able to air during its first tenure as an independent between 1956 and 1995) and give it full over-the-air exclusivity over Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks telecasts, resulting in the termination of its outsourcing agreement with WPWR (which would concurrently become a primary CW affiliate through an agreement with parent company Fox Television Stations). WGN‚ÄìChicago Bulls dispute with the NBA In 1982, the NBA instituted limits on the number of basketball games that teams could license to designated superstations ‚Äì such as WGN-TV ‚Äì that reached at least 5% of American cable households (not counting carriage within their home market), applying only to games that would conflict with those airing on the NBA's national cable partners, ESPN or USA Network, while allowing them to continue carrying up to 41 games per season under existing NBA local broadcast rules. The league's Board of Governors applied a set limit in June 1985, restricting the number of seasonal NBA telecasts that could be licensed to superstations to 25 games (which was applied to the Bulls' 1989 contract with Channel 9). In April 1990, NBA Commissioner David Stern lowered the number of superstation-licensed telecasts to an annual limit of 20 games, a move it claimed would limit negative impacts on game viewership on the league's national television partners (at the time, TNT and NBC) as a result of concurring deals involving WGN and the Bulls and TBS and the Atlanta Hawks (the latter of which was part of an overall deal with Turner Sports that granted TNT national telecast rights to games from other NBA teams). The new restriction spurred a conspiracy and antitrust lawsuit that was filed by the Bulls (one of two NBA teams that voted against the proposal, along with the New Jersey Nets, then broadcasting over Secaucus, New Jersey-based superstation WWOR-TV) and Tribune Broadcasting with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on October 16, 1990, alleging that the league rules would harm the Bulls, their fans and WGN and that Stern's proposal was aimed at \\"phas[ing] out such superstations telecasts entirely in increments of five games each year over the next five years.\\" (The NBA contended the restriction was exempt from antitrust law under a provision of the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which was deemed in later rulings to only be applicable to the sale or transfer a national game package to a television network and not those involving individual teams.) On January 26, 1991, Senior U.S. District Judge Hubert L. Will granted a permanent injunction in favor of the Bulls and WGN, prohibiting the league from instituting the policy on the determination that the NBA's superstation licensing restrictions were \\"a significant restraint of trade\\" in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. On February 20, 1992, attorneys with the NBA, WGN-TV and the Bulls reached an agreement to let WGN broadcast 30 Bulls games for the 1992‚Äì93 season, per the NBA's allotment that teams could license superstations to carry 30 games in a given season (up from both the limits mandated by the injunction and the proposed limit that resulted in the suit), a rule that would remain in place through the 1993‚Äì94 season before reverting to the originally proposed 25-game limit. Subsequently, on April 14 of that year, a three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals with the Northern District Court that overheard an appeal of Will's decision held that the superstation limit was an illegal restraint of trade. On November 5, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the appellate court decision. When the case was remanded back to Judge Will in October 1993, it was now based on new contractual terms in the league's deal with NBC that awarded it cable rights to games not covered by a national cable agreement, despite the network having yet to own general entertainment or sports-based cable outlets, as well as plans to implement a licensing fee (reportedly $250,000 per game) to teams that telecast over superstations. Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf (using the sustained fanbase of the Cubs through the WGN telecasts, even at times when the team's performance was mediocre to poor, as an example) and attorney Joel Chefitz both argued that the team's national availability through WGN was vital to maintaining the team's fanbase and to its financial success following Michael Jordan's sudden retirement from basketball and move to baseball. On January 6, 1995, Judge Will affirmed that the NBA's efforts to restrict carriage of the Bulls on WGN-TV was a \\"naked restraint\\" of competition in violation of antitrust laws, rejecting arguments by NBA representatives that broad television coverage through superstations hurt revenues for national, regional and local telecasts paid to the league and individual teams and noted that evidence \\"revealed that superstation coverage of the Bulls and Hawks may actually have helped to promote greater public interest in NBA basketball.\\" The ruling permitted the station to televise at least 30 games (eleven fewer than the 41 annual games that the Bulls and WGN requested) over the Chicago signal and superstation feed, while allowing the NBA to impose a reasonable rights fee (around $40,000, rather than the $100,000 licensing fee sought by the NBA) for broadcasts of each game, based on the consideration that the league received more than $2 million in annual copyright payments from WGN's Bulls broadcasts. On September 10, 1996, a three-judge Seventh Circuit panel overturned the 1992 decision and remanded the case to be re-heard by a federal judge. Although the Bulls initially maintained that WGN would still be able to nationally televise Bulls games, in October 1996, WGN-TV announced plans to restrict distribution of the 35 Bulls games it was scheduled to air during the 1996‚Äì97 season (a five-game increase over the 1995‚Äì96 season) exclusively to the Chicago area signal. (The WGN superstation would carry movies in place of the embargoed Bulls telecasts; the 9:00 p.m. newscast was also preempted nationally as a result of the restrictions due to their being subject to delay on the Chicago signal due to game overruns.) Despite the feed's continued carriage of Cubs and White Sox games and its purposing as the national feed of The WB for markets without a local affiliate, cable provider Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) ‚Äì which provided service to portions of the immediate Chicago area through its Chicago Cable TV arm ‚Äì cited the national restrictions on the Bulls as well as its own decision to make room for additional cable channels for its subsequent decision to remove the national WGN channel from its systems. However, criticism of the move from some subscribers led TCI to reverse course and retain the WGN superstation feed from affected systems in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan. (Some TCI systems elsewhere would not reinstate WGN until as late as 1998, through an effort by Tribune and the superstation feed's uplink carrier, United Video Satellite Group, to take advantage of TBS's conversion into a hybrid basic cable network.) On December 12, 1996, the Bulls and WGN reached a settlement to the six-year- long lawsuit, which allowed WGN to air an extended schedule of 41 games ‚Äì the maximum allowed under the NBA's local television policies ‚Äì during the 1996‚Äì97 season (35 that would air only on the Chicago signal and twelve that would be shown on both the local and superstation feeds). From the 1997‚Äì98 season thereafter, the number of games permitted to air on the superstation feed increased to 15 per year. The parties also agreed to replace the NBA's superstation tax with a revenue sharing model, under which the NBA would collect 50% of all advertising revenue accrued from the national WGN telecasts. The restrictions, however, resulted in some Bulls away games televised by the WGN national feed being unavailable to television providers within the opposing team's designated market if the game was not carried by a national network, a local television station or a regional sports network. Major League Baseball issues Attempts to restrict WGN's access to professional sports also extended to Major League Baseball under the stewardship of Fay Vincent, whose tenure as League Commissioner included various unsuccessful moves to impose blackout rules for games carried on superstations. Even prior to Tribune's purchase of the team, Chicago Cubs management had lauded the benefits that WGN-TV's telecasts of their games for providing needed exposure and bolstering their fanbase dating to 1953, when Cubs business manager James P. Gallagher expressed that the team's telecasts \\"[had] helped to promote interest in the Cubs and in baseball in general in the Chicago area[, helping] to keep [..] attendance up and [bringing] the game[s] to many people who could not get out to the ball park.\\" In August 1990, the MLB filed a petition to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to propose allowing local television stations to force cable systems to blackout superstation-licensed games involving local franchises within the team's home market through a change in how network program non-duplication rules define a \\"network program\\" to include live sports broadcasts shown simultaneously on local and out-of-market stations available via cable. United Video ‚Äì which, in addition to WGN, also distributed sister stations WPIX in New York City (which carried games from the New York Yankees), KTLA in Los Angeles (which aired Los Angeles Dodgers games) and KWGN-TV in Denver (which aired Colorado Rockies games) ‚Äì filed an opposition to the move, citing that the proposal would result in the superstation signals being \\"chopped up even more and made even more difficult for cable systems to receive.\\" Tribune Broadcasting contended that the petition was \\"protectionist,\\" noting the lack of evidence that \\"viewers' current ability to choose between a local broadcast and a different version of the same game is harmful to either sports or the public interest.\\" Tribune Broadcasting, TBS parent Turner Broadcasting System and the National Cable Television Association (NCTA) also filed petitions opposing the MLB request. In April 1992, Vincent lobbied Congress to repeal the compulsory license that allowed cable systems to carry superstation signals. In July 1992, Vincent ordered the relocation of the Cubs, the Atlanta Braves and two other National League Eastern Division teams that did not regularly broadcast their games on superstations (the Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals) to different divisions starting with the 1993 season, with the Cubs and the Cardinals being reassigned the NL Western Division and the Braves and the Reds being moved to the Eastern Division. Tribune responded to the move with a breach of contract lawsuit, alleging that the action overstepped the bounds of Vincent's authority. The move sparked concerns that WGN-TV's revenues from the Cubs telecasts would be impacted if the Cubs were forced to play a larger number of games against other Western Division teams based in the Pacific Time Zone, resulting in an increased number of games being shown in the late evening locally and potentially impact advertising revenue from the 9:00 p.m. newscast if it had to delay it after prime time more frequently because of the late baseball starts. Tribune representatives accused Vincent using the issue as part of his and some team owners animosity toward superstations to deflect from management or performance-related problems within their baseball clubs, though the Cubs denied Vincent's claim that its opposition to the move had mainly to do with the \\"scheduling difficulties that will be experienced by [...] WGN-TV.\\" U.S. District Judge Suzanne B. Conlon ruled in favor of Tribune and the Cubs in a preliminary ruling on July 23, 1992. A majority of MLB team owners passed a motion of no confidence against Vincent as MLB Commissioner in an 18-9-1 vote on September 4, 1992; he subsequently resigned on September 6. Loss of sports rights On January 2, 2019, NBC Sports Chicago reached exclusive multi-year deals with the White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks to take effect that fall, relegating their regional telecasts exclusively to multichannel television services. Subsequently, on February 13, the Cubs and Sinclair Broadcast Group (which was sued by Tribune for breach of contract in August 2018, after Sinclair's various attempts to use loopholes around FCC rules to acquire all of Tribune's broadcasting properties created regulatory hurdles in the former's acquisition of the company and Tribune's resulting termination of the attempted merger) announced of the formation of the Marquee Sports Network, a regional sports network planned for launch in the Spring of 2020 that would serve as the exclusive home of the Cubs' regional game telecasts. Unlike in New York and Los Angeles (where WPIX and KTLA maintain broadcast relationships with the New York Mets/New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively), neither team has elected to enter into a licensing agreement with either network to allow some games to remain available over-the-air via WGN-TV or another Chicago-area station. As such, beginning with the April 1 game between the Blackhawks and the Winnipeg Jets, WGN wound down its local sports coverage throughout the Spring and Summer of 2019 as the station's contracts with all four teams expired. The station's final Bulls game aired on April 9, 2019, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. WGN-TV's final Cubs game broadcast aired on September 27, 2019, against the rival St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. WGN-TV's final sports telecast involving one of the four legacy professional sports franchises that the station has been involved with during its history was the second game of a White Sox‚ÄìDetroit Tigers doubleheader at Guaranteed Rate Field on September 28, 2019. Ancillary sporting events (such as the Arlington Million horse race) may continue to be shown on WGN following the removal of its professional sports telecasts. ==Distribution outside the Chicago market== WGN America During WGN-TV's 37-year run as a national superstation, its national feed ‚Äì which eventually became known as WGN America in August 2008 ‚Äì distributed most of the station's sports telecasts to multichannel television providers throughout the United States and Canada. From November 8, 1978 until December 31, 1989, Tulsa, Oklahoma-based satellite uplink firm United Video Inc. distributed the WGN-TV Chicago signal nationwide, which allowed viewers outside Chicago to watch the station's sports telecasts as they would be seen locally ‚Äì with local advertising and station promotions intact ‚Äì except where league rules applying to superstations (such as the WGN‚ÄìBulls‚ÄìNBA dispute and restrictions on national superstation telecasts based on time periods where broadcast and cable partners held national exclusivity) as mentioned above or requests from local stations that held the exclusive local rights to opponents of the Chicago teams resulted in blackout restrictions applying to the game broadcasts. After syndication exclusivity rules were re-implemented on January 1, 1990, the major sports leagues began to impose some partial restrictions on the national carriage of WGN-televised sports broadcasts due to concerns over impacts to revenues from game attendance and national television rights. From 1996 until 2014, the national channel aired all Cubs and White Sox games and about 10 to 20 Chicago Bulls NBA games that WGN-TV televised locally in the Chicago market. As part of Tribune's conversion of the network from a superstation into a general entertainment cable channel, the company announced that WGN America would no longer broadcast Chicago Cubs, Bulls and White Sox games originated on WGN-TV in the Chicago market to a national audience. Peter Liguori, then the president and chief executive officer of Tribune Media, cited the limited revenue and viewership accrued from the national simulcasts relative to their contractual expense ‚Äì revenue was reportedly only covering 20% of the rights fees ‚Äì behind the decision to drop the national telecasts. Several seasons of sub-par play by the Cubs after Tribune's sale of the team to Thomas S. Ricketts in late 2009 also played a factor, as the team's television package cost five times as much for rights fees alone as the revenue it brought in for the national broadcasts. (Ironically, two seasons later, the Cubs underwent a major turnaround and had its strongest season in decades, going on to win its first World Series championship since 1908; WGN America would air the Cubs' 2016 World Series victory parade on November 4 of that year.) Even prior to the decision, WGN America had chosen not to air certain sports-related programming carried on the Chicago signal such as the Blackhawks' victory parade following its 2010 Stanley Cup championship win and a half-hour special paying tribute to the late Cubs player and broadcaster Ron Santo in 2011. (In the respective cases, WGN-TV's coverage of Santo's funeral aired on the digital subchannels of selected stations owned by Tribune and its partner group Local TV, while the NHL Network provided a simulcast of the Chicago signal's feed of the Blackhawks' victory parade.) The final WGN Sports-produced game telecast to air on WGN America was a contest between the Bulls and the Golden State Warriors, held at Chicago's United Center, on December 6, 2014. Outside of stations in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa that carried the games through syndication agreements, in the years preceding the end of professional team broadcasts on the station, WGN-produced sports telecasts were only viewable elsewhere in North America via Canadian television providers that carry the Chicago television station's signal or through the out-of-market sports packages NHL Centre Ice (for Blackhawks telecasts), NBA League Pass (for Bulls telecasts) and MLB Extra Innings (for Cubs and White Sox telecasts), sometimes incorporating local commercials and station promos that were omitted from the national simulcasts on WGN America in recent years. (This also was the case for WGN-produced games shown on WPWR- TV, as well as WLS-TV's Cubs broadcasts.) Prior to striking agreements with other stations in Illinois and Indiana to carry Blackhawks games in 2015, these methods were the only ways that American viewers could view WGN's Blackhawks game coverage outside the Chicago market, since WGN America was not permitted to carry the team's games due to the NHL's exclusive broadcast contracts (such as its national television deal with NBCUniversal that began in 2008). Regional syndication Dating back to at least the early 1980s, WGN-TV had syndicated its Chicago Cubs and White Sox telecasts to television stations in parts of the Midwestern U.S. (among them, WCEE [now Daystar owned- and-operated station WPXS] in East St. Louis, Illinois‚ÄìSt. Louis, Missouri, during its tenure as an independent station); select Bulls games aired by WGN and WCIU were also simulcast to many of these same stations and others within the team's designated market territory. All White Sox, Bulls and Cubs games televised on WCIU began to be syndicated to local stations in central Illinois and Iowa through the \\"WGN Sports Network\\" service beginning with each team's respective seasons in 2011. With the conversion of WGN America into a traditional cable channel, WGN-TV chose to expand distribution of its Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks telecasts through syndication agreements with television stations in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa ‚Äì primarily those affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV ‚Äì that are within each team's designated market area (including sister stations WHO-DT [channel 13] in Des Moines and WQAD-TV [channel 8] in Moline, Illinois ‚Äì respectively affiliated with NBC and ABC ‚Äì which carried WGN's baseball telecasts on their respective Antenna TV- and MyNetworkTV-affiliated digital subchannels). Most notably, WISH-TV (channel 8) in Indianapolis reached agreements to carry the station's Cubs, White Sox and Blackhawks telecasts (as well as games from the former that were produced by WLS-TV) as part of its efforts to restore sports content to its lineup in the months following the loss of its CBS affiliation ‚Äì ironically, to WGN-TV sister station WTTV (channel 4) and its Kokomo-based satellite WTTK (channel 29) ‚Äì and its subsequent switch to The CW in January 2015. Some games also air on MyNetworkTV-affiliated sister WNDY-TV (channel 23) due to pre-emption limitations included in The CW's affiliation contracts that also forced WGN to defer some of its sports telecasts prior to its 2016 disaffiliation from that network. WISH and WNDY never carried Bulls telecasts due to the presence of the Indiana Pacers (whose games air locally on Fox Sports Indiana) and due to restrictions enforced by the NBA on regional broadcasts outside a team's designated territory.

The organisation promotes the right of all people to sexual and reproductive health information as well as dedicated, confidential and affordable healthcare services.Website ==Early history== The availability of contraception in the Republic of Ireland was illegal in the Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland) from 1935 until 1980, when it was legalised with strong restrictions, later loosened. Ireland's first family planning clinic, the Fertility Guidance Company Ltd (later to change its name to the IFPA), was established by seven volunteers in Merrion Square, Dublin, in 1969. Among the founder-members were Dr. Michael Solomons, a gynaecologist, Dr. Dermot Hourihane, a pathologist, Dr. James Loughran, Dr. Joan Wilson and Dr. Robert Towers (editor of the Irish Medical Times). The organisation sidestepped the law by providing contraception for free and clients then making a \\"donation\\". In September 1970 doctors at the clinic begin fitting IUDs for the first time in the Irish Republic. By the end of 1970 the association was holding six clinics a week. They had acquired eleven doctors including another gynaecologist, Rosemary Jordan, sixteen lay workers, an extra nurse, a financial administrator, a waiting list of three to four weeks, and had seen 1180 new patients. There was difficulty in obtaining contraceptives; Joyce Neill, Chairwoman of the Northern Ireland Family Planning Association, helped by arranging that doctors who lived near the border would drive across into Donegal and post contraceptives to Dublin.http://ifpa.hyperlink.ie/index.php/eng/content/download/371/2519/file/pro- life_irishquestion.pdf In 1970 Dr. Michael Solomons was invited by two professors at Trinity College to lecture on family planning to medical students as part of their pharmacology courses. It was the first time that an Irish medical school had included the subject as a part of the curriculum. ==Historical developments== On 22 May 1971, with the support of the IFPA, a group of Irish feminists travelled to Belfast by rail and made their return to Dublin laden with contraceptive devices into a statement on the illogicality of the law. The event caused a sensation in the media in Ireland and spurred public debate on the topic.The Field day anthology of Irish writing: Irish women's writing and traditions edited by Angela Bourke; NYU Press 2002, pp. 200-201 In December 1971 Family Planning ‚Äì A Guide for Parents and Prospective Parents, a booklet written by three members of the IFPA Education Committee, Drs. Loughran, Nowlan, and Towers, was published. It became extremely popular and thousands of copies were distributed over the following years. In late 1975 the Galway Family Planning Association was set up, which was at the centre of a highly publicised controversy involving the Fine Gael TD Fintan Coogan, Fianna F√°il mayor Mary Byrne and Deirdre Manifold, convenor of a public rosary crusade, on one side, and staff and medical students of what was then known as University College Galway (UCG) on the other. Amongst those supporting the presence of a family-planning clinic were Michael D. Higgins, then a lecturer, and Eamon Gilmore, then a graduate student. Members of the student union claimed that Opus Dei had co-ordinated the opposition to the clinic. The clinic opened on Raleigh Row on 21 July 1977, with Tuam GP Dr John Waldron becoming one of the first volunteer doctors. In November 1976, the Censorship of Publications Board banned the IFPA's booklet Family Planning ‚Äì A Guide for Parents and Prospective Parents - the Board considered the booklet \\"indecent or obscene\\". Victor Bewley, Maurice E. Dockrell TD and Senator Evelyn Owens headed an appeal fund to go to court where the ban was rescinded. In 1978 the Health (Family Planning) Bill was introduced by Charles Haughey. This bill limited the provision of contraceptives, by medical prescription only and by a pharmacist, to bona fide \\"family planning or for adequate medical reasons\\". This was largely interpreted to mean that only married couples were legally entitled to access contraception.Irish Statute Book: Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 (Section 4) Chairperson of the IFPA, Dr Andrew Rynne, was the first person to be prosecuted under this law, for selling condoms to a patient in 1983 (on a weekend, when the pharmacies were closed). In 1988 the Irish Supreme Court barred family-planning clinics from telling pregnant women that lawful abortions are available in England. At that time about 5,000 Irish women were travelling abroad each year to have abortions.The Nation, 30 March 1992 In 1991, the IFPA was fined IR¬£700 for selling condoms in the Virgin Megastore in Dublin, in contravention of the legislation which restricted sale of contraceptives to pharmacies and other approved outlets. The \\"X Case\\" was a controversial 1992 Irish Supreme Court case which established the right of Irish women to an abortion if a pregnant woman's life was at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide. On the strength of this ruling, the IFPA set up a non-directive pregnancy counselling service in partnership with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. In 2005 the IFPA sued Ireland's government at the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of three women who traveled overseas that year for abortions: an Irish woman who had four previous children placed in state care, an Irish woman who didn't want to become a single mother, and a Lithuanian woman living in Ireland who was in remission from a rare form of cancer. The IFPA supported the women on the right to privacy under article 8 ECHR.ECHR 2032 In 2010 the court found that Ireland had violated the Convention by failing to provide an accessible and effective procedure by which a woman can have established whether she qualifies for a legal abortion under current Irish law.'Moral values' of abortion law defended, The Irish Times 12 Dec 2009 The court ordered Ireland to pay the Lithuanian woman ‚Ç¨15,000 ($20,000) in damages and said Irish doctors must be given clear legal guidance on the eligibility rules for abortions. In an 11-6 verdict, the 17 Strasbourg judges said Ireland was wrong to keep the legal situation unclear and said the Irish government had offered no credible explanation for its failure. In 2010 the IFPA was awarded the Pearl of Wisdom Award, which is given by the European Cervical Cancer Association to individuals and groups that have made exceptional efforts to prevent cervical cancer in their communities.

Written by the English studies scholar Richard North of University College London, it was first published by Cambridge University Press in 1997. The book was released as the twenty-second monograph in the Press' series, \\"Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England\\", edited by Simon Keynes, Michael Lapidge and Andy Orchard. Prior to the book's publication, North had previously authored other studies of Anglo-Saxon paganism, such as Pagan Words and Christian Meanings (1991). Heathen Gods in Old English Literature details North's theory that the god Ing played a prominent role in the pre-Christian religion of Anglo-Saxon England, and highlights references to him in such texts as Beowulf and the sole surviving Anglo-Saxon copy of the Book of Exodus. The book received a mixed reviewed in peer reviewed journals such as The Modern Language Review. Critics argued that North's interpretations of the evidence were too speculative. ==Synopsis== In the opening chapter, entitled \\"Nerthus and Terra Mater: Anglian religion in the first century\\", North begins by describing the approach that he has taken in this particular study of Anglo-Saxon paganism. Highlighting how little information regarding pre-Christian beliefs was recorded in the surviving Old English literature, all of which was produced in the Christian period, he argues that scholars must approach the subject by looking at the literary evidence produced by related Germanic-language societies elsewhere in Europe. He argues that by studying both the 1st-century accounts of Tacitus regarding religion in continental Germania and the Late Medieval accounts from Iceland and Scandinavia, scholars can shed further light on lost aspects of Anglo-Saxon heathenism.North 1997. pp. 1‚Äì25. Chapter two, \\"Ingui of Bernicia\\" looks at the concept of an Anglo-Saxon god named Ing. He discusses the existence of the Ingvaeones, a tribe in first-century Germania, arguing that they may have been devoted to Ing. Drawing comparisons from the cult of Dionysus in the Classical world, North argues that \\"Ing- was first a functional term for a human embodiment of Nerthus, then for a man representing Nerthus.\\" Proceeding to discuss the role of the Vanir in Norse mythology, he deals with Ingvi-Freyr of Uppsala in Sweden and then Ingui of Bernicia in Northern England, ultimately concluding that in early Anglo-Saxon history, a deity named Ingui was believed to be the progenitor of Anglian kings.North 1997. pp. 26‚Äì43. The third chapter is entitled \\"Ingui's cult remembered: Ing and the ingefolc\\" and deals with the literary evidence for a figure called Ing in Anglo-Saxon England.North 1997. pp. 44‚Äì77. ==Arguments== Ing- North spends much of his book devoted to the argument that there was a god known as Ing in Anglo-Saxon England. He highlights the fact that this Ing-hypostasis appears in various different contexts within Germanic- speaking Europe; it appears in the name of the Ingvaeones, a tribal grouping referred to in Tacitus' Germania, while in the later records of Norse mythology, the son of the god Nj«´r√∞ is known as Ignvi-freyr.North 1997. p. 26. From an examination of Tacitus' account, North argues that the Ingvaeone tribe would have worshiped the deity Nerthus, whom Tacitus described as an earth goddess. Although Tacitus never explicitly stated that the Ingvaeone worshiped Nerthus, North considers it likely because they lived proximi Oceano, near the sea, while Tacitus located the temple of Nerthus in insula Oceani, within the land of the Suebi tribe; North believes that these are sufficiently close to one another that they would have worshiped the same deity.North 1997. p. 27. North translates \\"Ingvaeone\\" as meaning \\"friends of Ing-\\". ==Reception and recognition== Academic reviews North's work was reviewed by T.A. Shippey of Saint Louis University for The Modern Language Review. Taking a critical approach to the book, Shippey was of the opinion that the author's arguments relied \\"very heavily on assumptions about the precise (one might say gnostic) meanings of sometimes rather common words.\\" He argues that many will not accept some of North's \\"more complex arguments\\" and that North's interpretation of Deor, 11. 14-6, via Hdvamdl, stanzas 96-102 as a political satire on √Üthelwulf of Wessex was \\"especially strained\\". However, on a more positive note Shippey accepted the \\"intrinsic plausibility\\" of North's presentation of Anglo-Saxon paganism as a \\"natural religion\\" which posed little threat or opposition to the incoming Christianity.Shippey 2000. Wider influence In his book, The Elder Gods: The Otherworld of Early England (2011), the English Anglo-Saxonist Stephen Pollington noted that North's book had been criticised for being \\"too free\\" in the interpretation of sources, but felt that it nonetheless \\"relieved the researcher from the emasculating fear of making an assumption or two and testing them against the evidence.\\"Pollington 2011. p. 26. ==References== Footnotes Bibliography * * * Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic Category:Cambridge University Press books Category:History books ","title":"Heathen Gods in Old English Literature"},{"id":"35349053","text":"Scott (centre left) beside Bertrand Russell leading an anti-nuclear weapons march in London Guthrie Michael Scott (30 July 1907 ‚Äì 14 September 1983) was an Anglican priest and anti-apartheid activist, who joined in the defiance of the apartheid system in South Africa in the 1940s - a long struggle for social justice in that country.

The armory was built in the 1930s under Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal and dedicated the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. After sixty years of service, and with the facility becoming obsolete for military purposes, Florida National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve officials announced plans to replace the armory on December 1, 2001.

The title is a 3D grid-based, real-time dungeon crawler based on the 1987 game Dungeon Master. It was originally released for Microsoft Windows in April 2012, and later ported for OS X and Linux in December 2012 and iOS in May 2015. Legend of Grimrock was the debut game of Almost Human, a four-man Finnish indie development team formed in February 2011, which self-financed the title's development. A sequel, Legend of Grimrock II, was released in October 2014. == Gameplay == An in-game screenshot with the open inventory of a party member Legend of Grimrock is a first-person action role-playing game with tile-based movement and realtime game mechanics. Players control a party of one to four characters which they move through a 3D rendered grid-based dungeon, a style of gameplay popular in RPG games from the 1990s such as Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, from which Legend of Grimrock draws heavy inspiration. Gameplay consists of a combination of puzzle solving and combat. Characters within the party gain experience for slaying creatures and beasts within the dungeon, allowing them to increase in level and progress skills which enhance combat abilities and allow the casting of new spells, and equipment is obtained through exploration and solving of puzzles throughout the dungeon. Many of the harder puzzles throughout the game are designed as bonuses, being optional to the progression through the dungeon but granting superior items and equipment for solving them. In reference to its classic roots, the player has the option to switch on \\"old-school mode\\" when beginning a new game. In this mode the game's map system is deactivated, leaving navigation through the dungeon's grid down to the player alone; this references the 1990s games which Grimrock is based on, which left remembering routes and paths through the dungeon completely down to the player. The game's digital manual contains a printable grid sheet which encourages players to chart their course through the game to this end. == Plot == Screenshot of Legend of Grimrock showing an altar room On top of Mount Grimrock, an airship carries a group of prisoners escorted by armed knights. The prisoners, sentenced by \\"the court\\" for crimes against the King, have been sentenced to be thrown into the pit of Mount Grimrock, at which point their crimes will be absolved. However, no prisoner pardoned in this manner has ever returned. On being sealed within the mountain, the prisoners make their way downwards through the levels of Grimrock Dungeon, guided by a disembodied voice which comes to them in their sleep promising that a way of escape for both it and the party awaits at the bottom of the dungeon. The party also occasionally finds notes from a previous wanderer of the dungeon named Toorum, who aside from offering clues to certain puzzles and hidden stashes of equipment, talks about his experiences of the dungeon's periodic tremors and the dungeon's design seemingly meant to be \\"traversed from the top down\\". Eventually the party reaches the bottom level, signposted as \\"Prison\\". Inside, the source of the voice guides the player to reconstruct a broken machine which will activate a portal out of the dungeon, however upon assembling the parts and repairing it, the voice is revealed to be the machine itself, which manifests as a giant mechanical clockwork cube which attempts to crush the party. Escaping through a portal, the party locates the tomb of the creators of Grimrock Dungeon, who left behind scrolls explaining the dungeon's purpose of containing the machine, which they refer to as \\"the Undying One\\", until \\"the gears of time finally come to rest\\". The tomb also contains a weapon designed to be used in the event of the Undying One's escape from confinement. Using the weapon, which temporarily stuns the machine, the party disassemble the parts which they used to repair the Undying One and deal a fatal blow to it using spells of lightning. The Undying One eventually explodes and falls apart, triggering another tremor which shakes the dungeon apart. The last scenes show the party running down a stone hallway of the dungeon, before a beam of pale blue light explodes from Mount Grimrock, ascending to the sky. A gigantic crater is shown to be all that remains of Mount Grimrock, the final fate of the prisoners seemingly unknown. == Development and release== In 2001 LoG began as Dungeon Master clone hobby project called Dungeon Master 2000 by a former Amiga demoscene coder.Dungeon-Master.com forum - Escape from Dragon Mountain (2001)Internet Archive - dm2k (2002) Later it was renamed Escape from Dragon Mountain and released in its final version in 2004.Internet Archive - Escape from Dragon MountainDungeon Master Encyclopedia - Escape from Dragon Mountain In early 2011 the developers decided to grow the project beyond being a simple clone and started aiming for commercial game quality. The developers used also other games as inspiration for the game, including Eye of the Beholder and Ultima Underworld. The developers established an indie video game company called \\"Almost Human\\" located at Matinkyl√§, Espoo in Finland.http://www.grimrock.net/2011/07/14/the-almost-human-team/ The four founding developers left the Finnish video game industry (Remedy Entertainment, Futuremark) and started working on the game full-time, now named Legend of Grimrock.Announcement by PetriH \\"Ok, time to reveal some secrets... We have started an indie game company and we're now working on this full time (4 devs).[...] at http://www.grimrock.net/\\"(30-Jun-2011) A forum and development blog was set up and updated frequently. The game was first released for the Windows platform on 11 April 2012 in DRM-free versions on the developer's website and GOG.com, and also a Steam version. On 4 October 2012, with the release of patch 1.3.1, an editor was included which allowed the creation of user generated dungeons & content and led to the development of a vivid modding community.Dungeon Editor Released + Special Sale On 19 December 2012 the game was released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle 7Humble Bundle 7 includes Dungeon Defenders, Legend of Grimrock on techspot including newly developed ports of the game for Mac OS and Linux. While the Mac and Linux port were released in December 2012, the iOS port did not materialize until May 2015.http://www.grimrock.net/2015/05/07/legend-of-grimrock-ipad-launches-in- app-stores-worldwide/ In 2014 a live-action series, located in the Grimrock universe, from Wayside Creations (the makers of Fallout: Nuka Break) was funded through Kickstarter. An announced sequel, Legend of Grimrock II, was released on 15 October 2014. == Reception == Legend of Grimrock was generally well received by both critics and gamers upon release, garnering an average critic score of 82 from 49 reviews on Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the game for faithfully recreating the gameplay of old-school action RPGs into the modern era. GameSpy gave the game a 4.5/5 \\"Great\\" rating, saying that \\"the best aspect of Grimrock is its puzzles, which have been largely abandoned by RPG developers in this age of Internet hints and walkthroughs.\\" Destructoid's Patrick Hancock awarded the game a score of 95/100, claiming \\"Grimrock takes an old-school feel and injects it seamlessly into the modern era.\\" Edge said that the game wasn't \\"a love letter to Dungeon Master\\" but \\"a near-facsimile\\", saying that \\"Legend Of Grimrock replicates a classic faithfully enough to massage the nostalgia glands of anyone who played the original, and it's a test of the timelessness of an almost universally loved game.\\" Some reviewers commented negatively on the game's combat system. Jon Blyth of PC Gamer praised the game's revival of Dungeon Master's classic gameplay, but commented on the \\"exploitability\\" of the enemy AI, as \\"any single enemy, no matter how tough, can be dominated by a series of cowardly stab-retreats and sidesteps\\". In their 7.25/10 review, Game Informer also stated that while the game's modern presentation of an old-school game format was a \\"beautiful marriage\\", it failed in that \\"its lazy monster design encourages the worst kind of tedious, mechanically abusive player behavior, though, which is a grave offense in the world of party-based RPGs.\\" In January 2013, Almost Human announced that the game had sold over 600,000 copies. In October 2014, Almost Human announced that the number of sold copies had reached 900,000. In 2017, the game was selected for a collection of 100 Finnish games, which were presented on the opening of the Finnish Museum of Games in Tampere.Muistatko viel√§ n√§m√§ suomalaiset klassikkopelit?

The museum contains interactive exhibits and displays featuring antique and modern firefighting paraphernalia. The museum also educates its visitors in fire safety and prevention and is considered to be one of the finest centers of its kind in Texas. The museum's building, which was originally home to the Houston Fire Department's Fire Station No. 7, is listed on the National Register of Historic PlacesNational Park Service. \\"National Historic Landmarks Survey: List of National Historic Landmarks by State\\" (PDF). June 2011. Retrieved 4 July 2011 and is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. == Building history == The building which currently houses the Houston Fire Museum was originally Fire Station No. 7, Houston's oldest fire house. Designed in the Romanesque style by Olle J. Lorehn, the two-story brick building was completed in January 1899 and features rusticated stone details, a five bay front with Central arched entry flanked by two apparatus bay entries and unique parapet details. It was updated in the 1920s to accommodate motorized vehicles. Used as a fire station until 1968, the building sat empty after Fire Station No. 7 was relocated until its complete restoration in 1981 in preparation for the opening of the museum. == Exhibits and collection == The museum's exhibits highlight the evolution of firefighting technology as well as local fire service history and features interactive elements including a fire pole which visitors can slide down and a fire engine cab. The collection comprises both antique and modern firefighter uniforms, uniform emblems, and equipment; historic fire marks; and photographs from local and national fire service events including the 1947 Texas City disaster. The collection also features firefighting vehicles such as a hand-drawn and hand-powered pumper, a horse- drawn steam engine, and a 1912 American Automatic ware tower with an American LaFrance engine, the only vehicle of its type ever used by the HFD. == New museum == According to the Houston Fire Museum's official website, the construction of a new fire museum is currently in the planning stages. This new museum will be modeled after the old Central Fire Station and will emphasize fire safety and prevention education over firefighting history. == References  External links == * Official site Category:Museums in Houston Category:National Register of Historic Places in Houston Category:Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks Category:Firefighting museums in the United States ","title":"Houston Fire Museum"},{"id":"35349497","text":"RK Draƒçevo (HC Draƒçevo) () is team handball club from Draƒçevo, Republic of Macedonia.

Examples of particular herpes research include drug development, vaccines and genome editing. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are commonly thought of as oral and genital herpes respectively, but other members in the herpes family include chickenpox (varicella/zoster, VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr (EBV). There are many more members that infect animals other than humans, some of which cause disease in companion animals (cats, dogs, horses) or have economic impacts in the agriculture industry (pigs, cows, sheep). == Vaccine research == Various vaccine candidates have been developed, the first ones in the 1920s, but none has been successful to date. Due to the genetic similarity of both herpes simplex virus types (HSV-1 and HSV-2), the development of a prophylactic-therapeutic vaccine that proves effective against one type of the virus would likely prove effective for the other virus type, or at least provide most of the necessary fundamentals. , several vaccine candidates are in different stages of clinical trials. An ideal herpes vaccine should induce immune responses adequate to prevent infection. Short of this ideal, a candidate vaccine might be considered successful if it (a) mitigates primary clinical episodes, (b) prevents colonization of the ganglia, (c) helps reduce the frequency or severity of recurrences, and (d) reduces viral shedding in actively infected or asymptomatic individuals. The fact that a live-attenuated vaccine induced better protection from HSV infection and symptoms is not new, because live-attenuated vaccines account for most of the successful vaccines in use today. However, governmental and corporate bodies seem to support the more recent and safer but possibly less effective approaches such as glycoprotein- and DNA-based vaccines. == Vaccine design == Vaccine-elicited protection against HSV is challenging to achieve due to the ability of herpesviruses to evade many aspects of the mammalian immune response. As a general principle, the effectiveness of a HSV vaccine design is often inversely proportional to its safety. Subunit vaccines, which consist of individual or small groups of viral antigens, remove all risk of complications resulting from the production of vaccine-associated infectious viral particles but are limited in the degree and scope of immunity that can be produced in vaccinated individuals. Inactivated vaccines, which consist of intact viral particles, dramatically increase the repertoire of viral antigens that engender the immune response but like subunit vaccines are generally constrained to producing humoral immunity. Like inactivated vaccines, replication-defective vaccines expose the immune system to a diverse swath of HSV antigens but can produce both cellular and humoral immunity because they retain the ability to enter cells by HSV-induced membrane fusion. However, replication-defective HSV vaccines are challenging to produce at scale and offer limited immunization due to the lack of vaccine amplification. Live- attenuated vaccines are highly efficacious, potentially eliciting both cell- mediated and humoral immunity against structural and non-structural viral proteins, but their ability to replicate can result in vaccine-related illness particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Whereas subunit vaccines have proven effective against some viruses, immunity produced by subunit HSV vaccines (e.g. Herpevac) have failed to protect humans from acquiring genital herpes in several clinical trials. In contrast, the success of the live- attenuated chickenpox vaccine demonstrates that an appropriately live- attenuated Œ±-herpesvirus may be used to safely control human disease. The challenge of achieving vaccines that are both safe and effective has led to two opposing approaches in HSV vaccine development: increasing the efficacy of subunit vaccines (primarily by improving adjuvant formulations), and increasing the safety of live-attenuated vaccines (including the development of \\"non-invasive\\" vaccines). == Vaccine candidates == The chart below is an attempt to list all known proposed HSV and VZV vaccines and their characteristics.

These vaccines infect the respiratory mucosa where their replication and localized spread provoke a robust immune response. The safety of these vaccines is based on their inability to invade the nervous system and establish life-long latent infections, as opposed to a general attenuation. Unlike other live-attenuated designs, these vaccines are cleared from the body once the immune response from vaccination has matured. In principle, by avoiding attenuation of HSV replication in the mucosa while removing the capacity to infect the nervous system, non-invasive vaccines have the potential to break the safety-efficacy dilemma by producing the strongest possible immune response while maintaining a high degree of safety. The VC2 non-invasive vaccine was developed by Dr. Gus Kousoulas at Louisiana State University. VC2 encodes two attenuating mutations that together reduce HSV entry into neurons. The establishment of latency is prevented in animal models such as mice, guinea pig, and rhesus monkeys. The R2 non-invasive vaccine was developed by Drs. Gregory Smith (Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine), Patricia Sollars & Gary Pickard (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), and Ekaterina Heldwein (Tufts University School of Medicine). R2 vaccines retain native replication in epithelial cells but are incapable of retrograde axonal transport and invasion of the nervous system. A single dose of the R2 vaccine passively introduced on mucosal tissues protects the nervous system from future infections and affords protection against lethal encephalitic infections in mice and rats. This vaccine strategy is noted for its effectiveness against both veterinary and clinical neuroinvasive herpesviruses. Thyreos LLC was founded to develop a herpesvirus vaccine platform based on the R2 design with targeted applications in human health, companion animal health, and livestock productivity.  Live-attenuated HSV-2 vaccine  Dr. William Halford at the Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine tested a live-attenuated HSV-2 ICP0‚àÜNLS vaccine in 2016, before his death in June, 2017. Vaccine attenuation is achieved by a mutation in ICP0 (ICP0‚àÜNLS) that increases the vaccine strain's sensitivity to interferon responses and limits its replication. Already proven as safe and effective in rodents and eliciting 10 to 100 times greater protection against genital herpes than a glycoprotein D subunit vaccine, Halford's vaccine was tested outside of the United States, in St. Kitts in 20 human volunteers. All 20 of the participants self-reported an improvement in symptoms, but only 17 received and completed all three dosages. Blot tests showed a clear antibody response, which cannot be instigated by a placebo effect. However, the human trial was conducted without approval from the FDA or from the SIU Institutional Review Board.  Replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine  288x288px David M. Knipe, a Professor at Harvard Medical School has developed dl5-29. The dl5-29 vaccine is also known under the name ACAM-529 or HSV-529, a replication-defective vaccine that has proved successful in preventing both HSV-2 and HSV-1 infections and in combating the virus in already-infected hosts, in animal models. The HSV-529 is a leading vaccine candidate which has been investigated in numerous research publications, and is endorsed by many researchers in the field (i.a. Lynda A. Morrison and Jeffrey Cohen). The vaccine induces strong HSV-2-specific antibody and T-cell responses, protects against challenge with a wild-type HSV-2 virus, reduces the severity of recurrent disease, and provides cross-protection against HSV-1. The ongoing trials would prove if a durable immune response in humans is to be successfully achieved or if the vaccine is too over attenuated to do the same. The vaccine is now being researched and developed by Sanofi Pasteur.  DNA- based vaccine  Professor Ian Frazer developed an experimental vaccine with his team at Coridon, a biotechnology company he founded in 2000. The company, now known under the name Admedus Vaccines, is researching DNA technology for vaccines with prophylactic and therapeutic potential. What's different about this vaccine is the way that response is being created. Instead of introducing a weakened version of the herpes virus or protein subunit, this vaccine uses a small section of DNA to produce T-cells and stimulate the immune response. The new vaccine candidate is designed to prevent new infections, and to treat those who already have the infection. In February 2014, it was announced that Frazer's vaccine against genital herpes passed human safety trials in a trial of 20 Australians. In October 2014, Admedus announced success in creating a positive T-cell response in 95% of participants. Further research is required to determine if the vaccine can prevent transmission. In July 2014, Admedus increased its stake in Frazer's vaccines by 16.2%. In addition, $18.4 million was posted as funds raised towards Phase II vaccine testing and research. The HSV-2 Phase II trial began in April 2015. Interim results were published on March 4, 2016 and based on the results of a scheduled, blinded, pooled analysis of data from the first 20 patients to receive at least three vaccinations in the randomised, placebo controlled Phase II study with the following results: * No safety issues have been noted in this cohort of patients. The data remains blinded to protect the integrity of the trial. * Study participants had a marked decrease in viral lesions (outbreaks) with a drop of over 90% in the monthly rate versus baseline. * The average number of days HSV-2 was detected in patients was reduced versus baseline. On 19 October 2016, Admedus released interim results from the ongoing HSV-2 Phase IIa study. The unblinded data demonstrated a 58% reduction in viral shedding compared to baseline and a reduction in outbreaks of 52% post vaccination and 81% overall reduction post-booster.  Other vaccine exploration  Vitaherpavac - In patients with monotonously recurrent genital herpes infection and history of failure of standard vaccination, anti-relapse efficacy of Vitaherpavac vaccine was demonstrated after allergometry-based tailored choice of vaccine administration regimen. The used approach was associated with lower antigenic load and sensitization, more than three-fold increase in relapse-free period in 85% of treated patients and improvement of Th1-dependent immunity. The Russian vaccine Vitagerpavak ‚Äî the only polyvalent vaccine in the world for treatment of the chronic gerpesvirusny infection (CGI) –Ü and –Ü–Ü types. It is developed in scientific research institute of virology of D.I. Ivanovsky of the Russian Academy of Medical Science. More than 15 years are applied in the Russian Federation. A study from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where glycoprotein D (gD-2) was deleted from the herpes cell, showed positive results when tested in mice. Researchers deleted gD-2 from the herpes virus, which is responsible for herpes microbes entering in and out of cells. The vaccine is still in early stages of development and more research needs to be conducted before receiving FDA approval for clinical trials. Research conducted by the NanoBio Corporation indicates that an enhanced protection from HSV-2 is a result of mucosal immunity which can be elicited by their intranasal nanoemulsion vaccine. NanoBio published results showing efficiency in studies conducted in both the prophylactic and the therapeutic guinea pig model. This included preventing infection and viral latency in 92% of animals vaccinated and a reduction in recurrent legions by 64% and viral shedding by 53%. NanoBio hopes to raise funds in 2016 to enter into Phase I clinical testing. Profectus BioSciences intends to use its PBS Vax therapeutic vaccine technology to engineer a vaccine for HSV-2. The vaccine is in early development and much is unknown about its viability. Biomedical Research Models, a Worcester-based biopharmaceutical company has been awarded a fund for the development of a novel vaccine platform to combat mucosally transmitted pathogens such as HSV-2. The company Tomegavax (recently acquired by Vir Biotechnology) is researching to utilize cytomegalovirus (CMV) vectors in the development of a therapeutic vaccine against herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), the causative agent of genital herpes. It has been awarded a grant by the NIH for this purpose. Redbiotec, a privately held Swiss biopharmaceutical company, based in Zurich as a spin-off of the ETH Zurich, is focusing on the development of a therapeutic vaccine against HSV-2. Redbiotec's preclinical vaccine shows over 90% of lesion score (vs. approx. 50% for GEN-003 of Genocea) in early findings. Sanofi Pasteur and the clinical-stage immunotherapy company Immune Design have entered a broad collaboration, which will explore the potential of various combinations of agents against HSV-2, including an adjuvanted trivalent vaccine candidate G103, consisting of recombinantly-expressed viral proteins.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States conducted phase III trials of Herpevac. In 2010, it was reported that, after 8 years of study in more than 8,000 women in the United States and Canada, there was no sign of positive results against the sexually transmitted disease caused by HSV-2 (and this despite earlier favorable interim reports). PaxVax, a specialty vaccine company, partnered with Spector Lab at the UC San Diego Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine regarding the development of a genital herpes viral vector vaccine. The vaccine was in the pre-clinical stage. The vaccine is no longer listed on their website as a present endeavour and has likely been discontinued. A private company called BioVex began Phase I clinical trials for ImmunoVEX, another proposed vaccine, in March 2010. The Company had commenced clinical testing in the UK with its vaccine candidate for the prevention and potentially the treatment of genital herpes. The biopharmaceutical company Amgen bought BioVex and their proposed ImmunoVEX vaccine appears to have been discontinued, furthermore it has been removed from the company's research pipeline. A live, attenuated vaccine (which was proven very effective in clinical trials in Mexico) by the company AuRx has failed to proceed to a Phase III trial in the year 2006, due to financial reasons. The AuRx therapy was shown to be safe and decrease the occurrence of lesions by 86% after one year. Mymetics is developing a pre-clinical preventative vaccine for HSV 1 and 2 using its virosome technology. There has not been any recent announcement by the company regarding their vaccine, which seems to have been taken off from the company's research product pipeline. HerpV, a genital herpes vaccine candidate manufactured by the company Agenus, announced Phase II clinical trial results in June 2014. Results showed up to a 75% reduction in viral load and a weak reduction in viral shedding by 14%. These results were achieved after a series of vaccinations and a booster dose after six months, signalling the vaccine may take time to become effective. Further testing results are to show if the vaccine is a viable candidate against genital herpes. There has not been any recent announcement by Agenus regarding the vaccine HerpV, which seems to have been taken off from the company's research product pipeline. Genocea Biosciences has developed GEN-003, a first-in-class protein subunit T cell-enabled therapeutic vaccine, or immunotherapy, designed to reduce the duration and severity of clinical symptoms associated with moderate-to-severe HSV-2, and to control transmission of the infection. GEN-003 includes the antigens ICP4 and gD2, as well as the proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M. GEN-003 had concluded Phase IIa clinical trials. In December 2015, Genocea announced interim data showing a 58% decrease in viral shedding and a 69% decrease in genital lesions. They also showed one of the doses stopped outbreaks for at least 6 months. GEN-003 was undergoing a Phase IIb clinical trial in the United States. Genocea has announced it would shift their strategic efforts to cancer vaccines while at the same time heavily cutting down on research and development of GEN-003 vaccine against genital herpes. Being unable to secure funding or partnering with another company, Genocea's further vaccine development remains to be determined. Vical had been awarded grant funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases division of the NIH to develop a plasmid DNA-based vaccine to inhibit recurring lesions in patients latently infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The plasmid DNA encoding the HSV-2 antigens was formulated with Vaxfectin, Vical's proprietary cationic lipid adjuvant. Vical is concluding Phase I clinical trials, while reporting data showing the vaccine candidate failed to meet the primary endpoint. The San Diego-based company was forced to concede that their herpes strategy had misfired, with their vaccine failing to perform as well as a placebo. However, that seemed to may have changed, since 20 June 2016, when Vical released phase I/II results at ASM. Their vaccine (named VCL-HB01) was involved in a Phase II clinical trial. The recent trial, similarly to a past trial again missed the primary endpoint and therefore the company is discontinuing the vaccine and moving to other pipeline products. ==Genome editing== Another area of research for HSV treatment or a potential cure is the use of genome editing. It is thought that by cleaving the DNA of HSV that infects neurons, thereby causing destruction or mutational inactivation of the HSV DNA, the virus can be greatly treated or even cured. Notable research The Jerome Lab run by Dr. Keith Jerome at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has looked at using zinc finger nuclease as well as endonuclease to prevent HSV from replicating. Most recently Dr. Jerome and his lab were able to demonstrate cleavage of latent HSV in a living organism, which is vital to disabling the virus. On August 18, 2020 the team led by Jerome and Martine Aubert published a paper in Nature Communications showing that, through a series of incremental improvements on their original method, they had destroyed up to 95% of herpes virus lurking in certain nerve clusters of mice, with 3 years of work expected before clinical trials are considered. Editas Medicine, that previously collaborated with the Cullen Lab, are researching CRISPR-Cas9 for its use in Herpes Simplex Keratitis. Researchers at Temple University have been researching how to disrupt HSV from replicating that could eventually lead to a cure. Some members of research team at Temple University have also joined forces to create Excision BioTherapeutics. The company intends to begin clinical trials in 2022. Researchers at the University Medical Center Utrecht, using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, have showed promising results in clearing HSV-1 infection by simultaneously targeting multiple essential vital genes in vitro. The researchers are now looking at targeting latent HSV-1 genomes and are investigating in vivo model systems to assess the potential therapeutic application. ==Herpes simplex pharmaceutical drugs== A research paper providing an overview of the relatively recent state of research can be found on this page.  Pharmaceutical drugs  Since the introduction of the nucleoside analogs decades ago, treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections has not seen much innovation, except for the development of their respective prodrugs (Aciclovir, Famciclovir, Valacilovir..). Drawbacks such as poor bioavailability or limited effectiveness of these drugs require further research effort of new pharmaceutical drugs against the herpes simplex disease. The inhibitors of the Helicase-primase complex of HSV represent a very innovative approach to the treatment of herpesvirus disease.Helicase‚Äìprimase inhibitors as the potential next generation of highly active drugs against herpes simplex viruses {  style=\\"text- align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"width:20%;background:#silver\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Pharmaceutical Drug ! style=\\"width:20%;background:rgb(100%,50%,80%);\\"Company ! style=\\"width:20%;background:rgb(90%,50%,80%);\\"Lead Researcher ! style=\\"width:20%;background:rgb(80%,50%,80%);\\"Type ! style=\\"width:20%;background:rgb(70%,50%,80%);\\"Status - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Aciclovir  patents expired  Schaeffer & B.

The hammerhead, which targets the mRNA of the UL20 gene, greatly reduced the level of HSV-1 ocular infection in rabbits, and reduced the viral yield in vivo. The gene-targeting approach uses a specially designed RNA enzyme to inhibit strains of the herpes simplex virus. The enzyme disables a gene responsible for producing a protein involved in the maturation and release of viral particles in an infected cell. The technique appears to be effective in experiments with mice and rabbits, but further research is required before it can be attempted in people infected with herpes. In 2016, researchers showed that the genome editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas can be used to limit viral replication in multiple strains of herpesviruses, in some cases even eliminating the infection altogether. The researchers tested three different strains of herpesviruses: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the cause of mononucleosis and some cancers; Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1) and (HSV-2), which cause cold sores and genital herpes respectively; and Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which causes congenital herpes. The results indicated that CRISPR can be used to eliminate replication in all three strains of the virus, but that the technology was so far only successful in actually eradicating EBV. The authors think this may be because the EBV genome is located in dividing cells that are easily accessible to CRISPR. Comparatively, the HSV-1 genome targeted by CRISPR is located in closed-off, non-replicating neurons, which makes reaching the genome much more challenging. Another possibility to eradicate the HSV-1 variant is being pursued by a team at Duke University. By figuring out how to switch all copies of the virus in the host from latency to their active stage at the same time, rather than the way the virus copies normally stagger their activity stage, leaving some dormant somewhere at all times, it is thought that immune system could kill the entire infected cell population, since they can no longer hide in the nerve cells. This is a potentially risky approach especially for patients with widespread infections as there is the possibility of significant tissue damage from the immune response. One class of drugs called antagomir could trigger reactivation. These are chemically engineered oligonucleotides or short segments of RNA, that can be made to mirror their target genetic material, namely herpes microRNAs. They could be engineered to attach and thus 'silence' the microRNA, thus rendering the virus incapable of keeping latent in their host. Professor Cullen believes a drug could be developed to block the microRNA whose job it is to suppress HSV-1 into latency. Herpes has been used in research with HeLa cells to determine its ability to assist in the treatment of malignant tumors. A study conducted using suicide gene transfer by a cytotoxic approach examined a way to eradicate malignant tumors. Gene therapy is based on the cytotoxic genes that directly or indirectly kill tumor cells regardless of its gene expression. In this case the study uses the transfer of the Herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase (HSVtk) as the cytotoxic gene. Hela cells were used in these studies because they have very little ability to communicate through gap junctions. The Hela cells involved were grown in a monolayer culture and then infected with the HSV virus. The HSV mRNA was chosen because it is known to share characteristics with normal eukaryotic mRNA. The HSVtk expression results in the phosphorylation of drug nucleoside analogues; in this case the drug ganciclovir, an antiviral medication used to treat and prevent cytomegaloviruses, converts it into the nucleoside analogue triphosphates. Once granciclovir is phosphorylated through HSV-tk it is then incorporating DNA strands when the cancer cells are multiplying. The nucleotide from the ganciclovir is what inhibits the DNA polymerization and the replication process. This causes the cell to die via apoptosis. Apoptosis is regulated with the help of miRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. These miRNAs play a critical role in developing the timing, differentiation and cell death. The miRNAs effect on apoptosis has affected cancer development by the regulation of cell proliferation, as well as cell transformation. Avoidance of apoptosis is critical for the success of malignant tumors, and one way for miRNAs to possibly influence cancer development is to regulate apoptosis. In order to support this claim, Hela cells were used for the experiment discussed. The cytotoxic drug used, ganciclovir, is capable of destroying via apoptosis transduced cells and non-transduced cells from the cellular gap junction. This technique is known as the \\"bystander effect,\\" which has suggested to scientists that the effect of some therapeutic agents may be enhanced by diffusion through gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) or cell coupling. GJIC is an important function in the maintaining of tissue homeostasis and it is a critical factor in balance of cells dying and surviving. When Hela cells were transfected with the HSV-tk gene, and were then put in a culture with nontransfected cells, only the HSV-tk transfected Hela cells were killed by the granciclovir, leaving the nonviral cells unharmed. The Hela cells were transfected with the encoding for the gap junction protenin connexin 43 (Cx43) to provide a channel that permits ions and other molecules to move between neighboring cells. Both Hela cells with the HSV-tk and without the HSV-tk were destroyed. This result has led to the evidence needed to state that the bystander effect in the HSV-tk gene therapy is possibly due to the Cx-mediated GJIC. == References == Category:Herpes Category:Medical research ","title":"Herpes simplex research"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(B,[["render",I]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/33.md","filePath":"quotes/33.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/33.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{x as __pageData,N as default};
