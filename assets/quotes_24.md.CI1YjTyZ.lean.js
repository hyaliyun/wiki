The film was screened in both Kabul and London simultaneously. In July 2014, the company launched Back to the Future screenings, set in a life-size recreation of the 1950s Hill Valley town featured in Robert Zemeckis's film. The first two Back to the Future dates were cancelled with only a few hours' notice and the company offered a full refund or exchange for the cost of tickets, but not for any booking fees; the opening dates of its 2013 production of Brazil had also been cancelled at short notice. In December 2014, Secret Cinema announced the screening of a secret film in response to Sony's withdrawal from the release of The Interview. The screening was revealed to be Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which was simultaneously screened in Rome, London, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, in support of Article 19, a charity dedicated to the freedom of speech. Screenings included live speeches and readings, music and performances. In March 2015, the company and its founder were criticised on Twitter and other publications for using unpaid actors; the company defended its practice and described the volunteers as interns who benefited from the experience. In June 2015, Secret Cinema launched Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back, its biggest production to date. As part of the hundred shows that ran in London, a side-event at Alexandra Palace with musical guests DJ Yoda, Nightmares on Wax and Jamie Jones raised ¬£11,000 for the Refugee Council. A further ¬£29,000 was raised for the charity from the show. The production made it to the top ten UK box office for eleven weeks, generating a total of ¬£6.45 million. In September 2015, the company announced it would raise funds to bring free movie screenings to Syrian refugees in Europe, starting with the camp in Pas-de-Calais, France. More recently, as screenings have grown in size and popularity, the company have decided to forewarn cinema-goers of the film to avoid disappointment. Their most recent screening of Dirty Dancing attracted thousands of fans, and it is still subject to debate whether the new set-up is welcome. In April 2017, Secret Cinema ran an extended production of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! Artists such as Jarvis Cocker and Groove Armada performed for audiences. The show drew attendees such as Matt Bellamy from Muse, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Over 70,000 people attended, putting Moulin Rouge back into the UK box-office top ten for eleven weeks. Subsequent productions have included Blade Runner, Romeo + Juliet, Casino Royale and Stranger Things. In early 2020 Secret Cinema made a deal with Disney and Patwardhan Investments Ltd. In May 2020, Secret Cinema moved the entire run of its 2020 Dirty Dancing summer programme of immersive screenings to 2021, due to the COVID-19 crisis.  Charity work  In August 2014, the company held a charity screening of Dead Poets Society, to mark the death of actor Robin Williams. All proceeds were donated to the mental health charity Mind. Each Secret Cinema production raises money for charities including Save the Children; the National Alliance on Mental Illness; Refugee Council; and MAC UK, a local Camden charity which provides mental health services to disadvantaged youth. ==References *Official site Category:Entertainment companies of the United Kingdom Category:Film organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Cinemas in the United Kingdom ","title":"Secret Cinema"},{"id":"35170281","text":"Platform Zhonghuamen railway station () is a railway station in Yuhua Road near Zhonghua Gate of Nanjing.

The game is set in the fantasy universe of Aarklash, a continent riven by an unending war. The player follows a party of Akkylannian fighters in their quest to seek out and destroy the source of the latest threat posed by the Alchemists of Dirz. Their journey will take them through numerous settings with rich decors where they will encounter other races which populate the continent. ==Gameplay== Confrontation aims to reproduce the tactical combat of heroic fantasy classics as Baldur's Gate. The party is made up of four characters, chosen by the player amongst 12 available classes. Various synergies are possible and any combination could work to succeed a mission. However, it is far more challenging with an unbalanced party. Four of Aarklash's factions are found in the game. The Akkylannian people built an empire whose aims are both religious and military. The Syhar are depraved scientists, specialized in alchemy and ungodly experiments. Their origins lie within the Empire of Akkylannie, but their quest to create the perfect being led them to be condemned for heresy and they were forced to flee. Seeking an army to protect themselves, the Syhars mixed goblin blood with that of men and created the Orcs. The union of Yllia, the Moon goddess, with the leader of a great pack of wolves, lead to the birth of the Wolfen.

Changhars are mostly vagabond and speak Changhri dialect of Haryanvi or Ranghari and Marwari. == Origin == According to their traditions, the Changar left Rajasthan, with their initial settlement being in the districts of Bikaner, Churu and Nagaur. From there the Changars migrated to Sindh. A further migration then took place to Punjab, where many are still found. They speak Marwari among themselves, and Urdu with outsiders. Many of them migrated to Persia in the Sasanian Empire, from there to Sasanian Egypt to Byzantine Empire, where there descendant's became known today as the Romani people in Turkey, who live mainly in East Thrace.People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D.K Samanta, S.K Mandal & N.N Vyas pages 271 to 274 Popular Prakashan == Present circumstances ==  In India  The Changar are largely a landless community, with a few still involved in their traditionally occupation of lime manufacture. Most are now daily wage labourers. Like other Rajasthani Muslims, the community has a caste association or biradari panchayat, which resolves intra community disputes and enforces communal norms. Although the Changhar live in close proximity to other such Muslim castes such as the Hiranbaz, Sindhi-Sipahi and Qaimkhani, intermarriages between them and the Changar are extremely rare. The Changhar are Sunni Muslims, and their customs are similar to other Rajasthani Muslims. They have been granted Other Backward Class status, which makes them subject to a number of affirmative actions policies of the Government of India.  In Pakistan  The Shamsi(Changar) in Punjab are strictly endogamous, and the basic social unit is the Jhugi or tent( Now new generation are mostly educated and have their own houses). Generally it is close kin who camp together, and marriages are preferred within the encampment. They do not have strong caste councils to maintain community norms. Mostly of the Shamsi called Changar in Pakistan migrated from Indian Jalindher's Tehsil Sultan Poor and District Ludhiana. They spread in all Pakistan. Mostly settled in Chiniot and Faisalabad District. The Changar are Sunni Muslims and either speak Haryanvi Punjabi or Seraiki depending on what language the settled community in which they are camped speaks (Although they speak Parsi language called by one of the old Changar). They speak this language as secret language when they inform some thing secret which each other. The majority of the Changars within northern and central Punjab are agricultural labourers, visiting villages during harvest time. They have established routes that they follow, and each Changar sub-group is allocated a particular village, and often serve a particular family in that village. Their patrons tend to belong to the large Muslim Jat community. In addition to agricultural labour, the Changar are also involved in the manufacture of baskets and brooms, which they sell to settled communities. Nowadays only 10% are involving in this work. Many of Shamsi (Changar) are now in good Jobs and local business after getting education. In local Government they have their own Counselors and have Chairmanship. In 1990 many of Shamsi moved toward Dubai for better future, they earn for his family and country now getting part of i community progress.

Le Roux's brother Anthonie Smith, was an architect, primarily of Dutch Reformed Church buildings. They collaborated when Le Roux did paintings for one of the churches in Ladismith in 1942. Detail of Mutual Building murals In 1930 Le Roux matriculating from a prominent Afrikaans school in Cape Town, Jan van Riebeeck High School. Le Roux displayed precocious talent, completing his degree at the University of Cape Town Michaelis School under John Wheatley at the age of 17. He received a government bursary to study mural-painting in Italy and was commissioned in 1938, with fellow student Eleanor Esmonde-White, to create murals for the South Africa House Mural Room. Later in that year, the two artists received a commission to provide murals for the Cunard Liner Queen Elizabeth. On his return to South Africa, he joined the New Group of artists and busied himself with several large commissions in Cape Town and Johannesburg, most notably the murals of the Mutual Building in Darling Street, Cape Town, completed in 1942. His versatility was also on display in his illustrations of Die vlammende Fez, a book by Afrikaans poet I.D. du Plessis (1900‚Äì1981) published in 1944. Between 1943 and 1949 he was Director of the Pretoria Art Center and curator of the Pretoria Art Collection. He served on the War Art Advisory Committee and was a member of the International Art Club, South Africa. ==The Great Tate Gallery Affair== John Rothenstein was appointed Director of the Tate in 1938. He was challenged to find curators willing to work for the low salary of ¬£300. While on a trip to South Africa in 1950, he met Le Roux Smith Le Roux. Le Roux convinced Rothenstein that he held views on race that were out of place in the Apartheid state, and that he would suffer for these. Already charmed by the young South African, Rothenstein offered him the position of Deputy Keeper at the Tate. Le Roux Smith Le Roux immediately embarked on a campaign to effect the ouster of Rothenstein as Director. He used his access to archival material to find and leak information that would put the director in a bad light, among other misdemeanours, allowing the sale of a Renoir from the Courtauld Fund without proper procedures being followed. It was, however, his neglect of important European art movements like Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism and Surrealism that raised the ire of collectors like Douglas Cooper, an art historian and collector of Cubist works. Cooper's close friend Graham Sutherland, the painter, was a Trustee of the Tate and supported Le Roux. Le Roux found another ally in Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook, whose newspapers, Evening Standard and Daily Express published his leaks. As a public servant, Rothenstein was unable to comment on the press reports. With allegations left unanswered, Le Roux's campaign gained support from scholars (Denis Mahon), art critics (Denys Sutton of the Financial Times), members of parliament, and the press (Kingsley Martin of the New Statesman). The sensationalised resignation of Graham Sutherland from the Board of Trustees and venomous public letters from Douglas Cooper eventually gave the critics pause. Then, at the opening of Richard Buckle's Diaghilev exhibition, an exasperated Rothenstein, taunted by Cooper, lashed out and knocked the man's glasses off. The incident might have been a crisis for Rothenstein (he was nearly dismissed), but persuaded critics that the matter had gone too far. Le Roux's leaks attracted scrutiny and he was dismissed in 1954. Questions were asked of Rothenstein in the House of Lords however he would remain Director until 1964. ==After the Tate== Le Roux was employed by Lord Beaverbrook, sitting on a panel of judges of the Daily Express exhibition of pictures in 1955. Fellow judges were Graham Sutherland, art philosopher Herbert Read and Anthony Blunt, later identified as a member of the Cambridge Five. == References == Category:1914 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Afrikaner people Category:White South African people Category:South African art critics Category:South African art dealers Category:Muralists Category:Artists from Cape Town Category:Michaelis School of Fine Art alumni Category:People associated with the Tate galleries Category:20th-century South African painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Alumni of Ho√´rskool Jan van Riebeeck Category:South African male painters ","title":"Le Roux Smith Le Roux"},{"id":"35170534","text":"Lorna Moon (born Nora Helen Wilson Low; 16 June 1886 ‚Äì 1 May 1930) was a Scottish author and screenwriter from the early days of Hollywood. She is best known as the author of the bestselling novel Dark Star (1929) and as one of the earliest and most successful female screenwriters. As a screenwriter, she developed screenplays for notables including Gloria Swanson, Norma Shearer, Lionel Barrymore and Greta Garbo. ==Life== She was born in Strichen, Aberdeenshire, in Scotland, in 1886, the daughter of plasterer Charles Low and Margaret Benzies (1863‚Äì1945), a socialist and avowed atheist. In 1907 she met William Hebditch, a commercial traveller from Yorkshire who had stayed at the hotel run by her parents; the two were secretly married in Aberdeen and shortly after the couple left Scotland for Alberta in Canada, where Lorna Moon gave birth to her first child, William Hebditych (1908‚Äì1990), in 1908. In 1913 she left Hebditch and fell in with Walter Moon, with whom she had a child, Mary Leonore Moon (1914‚Äì1978). She and Walter travelled to Winnipeg, where she began working as a journalist and where she adopted a pen-name closer to her literary inspiration, Lorna Doone. An anecdote tells how she contacted Cecil B. DeMille and offered a critical appraisal of the screenplays of the day. He challenged her to come to Hollywood and write them herself if she thought she could do better; and by 1921 she did just that, working as a script girl and screenwriter. During her career in Hollywood she had a third child by Cecil B. DeMille‚Äôs brother William. This child, Richard, grew up unaware of his mother‚Äôs identity; in later years he discovered his parentage and wrote the memoir My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon. Lorna Moon contracted tuberculosis and died in a sanatorium in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1930, aged 43. She was cremated and her ashes were returned to Scotland, where they were scattered on Mormond Hill near Strichen. == Career == In 1920, Moon sent director Cecil B. DeMille a critique of his film Male and Female (1920) in which she \\"razzed him wickedly\\". She went on to train with DeMille at Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount Film Corporation, which later became Paramount Pictures. In the early 1920s, Moon suffered from tuberculosis and wrote short stories and plays from bed before returning to work in 1926. In 1926, Moon worked on screenplays for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer including Upstage (1926), After Midnight, Women Love Diamonds (1927), Mr. Wu (1927) and Love. Love was one of MGM's highest-earning films of 1927 and was considered a blockbuster, earning MGM $946,000 domestically and an additional $731,000 internationally. In 1929, Moon's novel Dark Star was released and reached the bestseller list. The novel was later adapted by Frances Marion into the 1930 film Min and Bill, starring Marie Dressler. Min and Bill is generally thought to have revived Dressler's career. ==Screen credits== Her screen credits include The Affairs of Anatol (1921), Don't Tell Everything (1921), Her Husband's Trademark (1922), Too Much Wife (1922), Upstage (1926), After Midnight (1927), Women Love Diamonds (1927), Mr. Wu (1927), and Love (1927). ==Literary works== Her literary works include Doorways in Drumorty (1925), a collection of short stories, and the novel Dark Star (1929). Dark Star was a critical success, and in 1930 was adapted for the screen as Min and Bill, starring Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery. Doorways in Drumorty contained a series of stories set in a fictional Scottish town: however the location and characters were drawn from her memories of Strichen, much to the indignation of certain of the townspeople, and her work was banned from the local library. ==Recent developments== The Collected Works of Lorna Moon, edited by Glenda Norquay, was published in 2002. In 2008 a plaque commemorating Lorna Moon was unveiled in Strichen. In 2010 a stage play, based on the stories in Doorways in Drumorty, was written by Mike Gibb and performed around Scotland by Red Rag Theatre. Further major Scottish tours were staged by Red Rag in 2011 and by Awkward Stranger 2019. Playwright and Author Mike Gibb also wrote Drumorty Revisited, a follow up to Lorna Moon's Doorways in Drumorty, which was published by Hame Press in 2019. A film based on the life of Lorna Moon, scripted by Alison Peebles, has been proposed, with Kate Winslet being named as a potential candidate to play the title role. ==Notes * Lorna Moon ‚Äì Lorna Moon on the IMDb * Lorna Moon at the Women Film Pioneers Project * Overview of Lorna Moon ‚Äì short article on the Gazetteer for Scotland website * The Far Side of Lorna Moon ‚Äì an article on Moon's literary life on the website of the Association for Scottish Literary Studies Category:Scottish screenwriters Category:British women short story writers Category:British women screenwriters Category:20th-century Scottish writers Category:20th-century British women writers Category:People from Aberdeenshire Category:1886 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Scottish women novelists Category:Scottish short stories Category:20th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:20th-century Scottish novelists Category:20th- century British dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century British short story writers Category:Women film pioneers Category:20th-century British screenwriters Category:Tuberculosis deaths in New Mexico ","title":"Lorna Moon"},{"id":"35170539","text":"The Old Market, Hove is a historic (grade II listed) building on the border of Brighton and Hove in England. It has served various functions, currently operating as a cultural performance centre under the name \\"TOMThe Old Market\\". ==History== The Old Market opened in 1828 as a covered marketplace for sales of meat, fish and vegetables. It supplied the residential development of Brunswick, which was originally independent from Brighton and Hove village. As Brighton and Hove have grown up around it, the building has catered for changing needs, operating as a riding academy and stables, warehouse and, since the 1980s, as an arts venue. Established as Old Market Arts Centre (OMAC), the initial arts venture entered difficulties. The building was renovated in 1998 by The Old Market Trust with a lottery grant of over four million pounds, as a home for The Hanover Band and a community arts venue for Brighton and Hove. Its current owners in 2010, Yes/No Productions made various changes in order to maximise potential use for gigs, theatre productions, events and performances after purchasing the building for ¬£800,000. In 2011 the building was reopened under the new name TOMThe Old Market. ==Programming== As TOMThe Old Market, a wide variety of performances and events have been programmed. Artists such as Django Django, Guillemots, James Rhodes and Jonathan Wilson have played. Comedians Daniel Kitson, Simon Munnery, Isy Suttie, Jonny Sweet have performed, along with many others as part of Brighton Comedy Festival. Theatre and events are also hosted.

The sailing boats produced by this shipyard are designed by Ian Farrier (1947-2017), and have a unique patented folding system without hinges in the beams or the critical beam to float join, allowing overall beam to be varied in seconds by just one person. ==History== After gaining hands-on experience from building and sailing his own sailboats, Ian Farrier designed a trimaran folding system and applied in 1973 for a patent that was granted in 1975 as the Farrier Folding System. In 1974, the original Prototype was built and launched by Farrier in Australia, followed in 1976 by the first Trailertri 18, and in 1980 by the first production fiberglass Farrier trimaran, that was named Australian Boat of the Year in 1981. In 1984, Ian Farrier funded by Corsair Marine in the US and started designing and building the F-27 trimaran Super Fox which set a race record in her first official event - the Two Man Around Catalina Race, a feat she repeated on 1986. In 1989, The F-27 CORSAIR won the multihull division of the Newport - Ensenada Race. For the first time in history the Nippon Ocean Racing Club recognised the F-27 as an official class in 1990, and during the same year the F-27 AQUA TEC won the Australian Multihull Offshore Championships (AMOC). F-27s were also the first multihulls invited to compete in the National Offshore One Design Regatta (N.O.O.D.). In 1991, Ian Farrier decided to leave the management of Corsair Marine to focus on new designs. Shortly thereafter the F-9A design was launched by Farrier Marine, together with the F-31 (production version of F-9A), that in 1992 was named Australian Sailboat of the Year. They were followed by the F-25C, the F-31, and the Corsair F-28, judged as Sailing World's 1998 Performance Multihull Sailboat of the Year. In 2001, Ian Farrier decided to part from Corsair Marine, stating that Farrier Marine had provided Corsair with all its production guides in the past, while regularly monitoring construction, quality and specification compliance, all of which took considerable time. After the separation, more time could be devoted to providing a larger range of both lower cost and more technically advanced designs, such as the F-22, F-32, F-33, F-39, F-41 and F-44SC. After abandoning Corsair Marine, Farrier announced a plan version of the F-33 production model named the F-32. In 2003, the F-33 was launched in Australia. In September 2007, the first F-39 was launched, followed in May 2008 by the first F-22, in July 2009 by the release of the F-32SR design and in November 2010 by the F-85SR design. December 2010 marked the first F-22 production float hull made and on 2011 the F-22 production version was released. However, after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake work on the new projects slowed a little, although the shipyard didn't suffer real casualties, apart from some damage at the moldmaker's factory, on the wall and floor. ==Product line== Current Farrier Marine's current product line is composed of the following models: Trimarans * F-22 and F-22R (2013) * The following may continue to be built, but are not built by Farrier Marine itself. * F-32 (2007) and F-32SR (2009) \\\\- \\"home builders version of the F-33 [replacing] the F-9 design series\\" * F-33 (2003) - \\"production design intended to be a maxi trailerable sport cruiser, while still being manageable single-handed\\" * F-36 (before 1996)- \\"A true ocean going cruiser, and demountable for transporting on a trailer (but not folding)\\". * F-39 (2007) - \\"Another new design that folds for marina docking - based on the F-36 - available only to experienced builders\\" * F-82A and F-82R - replaced the F-25A and F-25C, with many improvements and updated features.

He occupied a unique position amongst the English architects of the latter half of the 19th century, his long mastership of the architectural school at the Royal Academy of Arts having given him the opportunity of moulding and shaping the minds of more than a generation of students. Spiers wrote most of the articles dealing with architecture for the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. ==Biography== Phen√© Spiers was educated in the engineering department of King's College London, and proceeded thence to the atelier of Charles-Auguste Questel at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, for upwards of three years, a method of study rare for an architectural student in those days. On his return he won the gold medal and travelling scholarship of the Royal Academy, and in 1865 the Soane medal of the R.I.B.A. In 1871, after he had worked in the offices of Sir Digby Wyatt and William Burges, he gained second premium with a spirited design (showing a good deal of the Neo-Grec feeling consequent on his French training) for the new Criterion Theatre, London, and in the same year he submitted a design in a competition for Holloway Sanatorium. His work of about this period included Lord Monkswell's house, Chelsea, and the home of John Corbett which is now known as Chateau Impney in Droitwich Spa. Phene Spiers travelled in France, Spain, Egypt, Syria and the East, and besides his record of more purely architectural data, he made many water-colour sketches showing much talent and facility. He was a frequent exhibitor at various galleries, and a good specimen of his art ‚Äî the loggia at Hampton Court - is in the Victoria and Albert museum. His works include new edition of James Fergusson's History of Architecture and the further volumes on Indian and Eastern art; Architectural Drawing; The Architecture of Greece and Rome (jointly with W. J. Anderson); The Mosque at Damascus; and the articles on Persian and Roman architecture in Dr. Russell Sturgis's Dictionary of Architecture, besides an edition of Pugin's Normandy. The position to which his erudition and ability entitled him was fully recognized in other countries as well as his own, as is shown by his election to membership of many foreign societies in France, Spain and America. ==References== * ==External links== Category:1838 births Category:1916 deaths Category:Architects from London Category:English architecture writers Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Alumni of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts Category:Royal Academy Category:Architecture academics ","title":"Richard Phen√© Spiers"},{"id":"35170859","text":"The 1997 Euroleague Women was the inaugural edition of the competition, a refoundation of the FIBA Women's European Champions Cup, FIBA Europe's premier competition for women's basketball clubs.

Shweta (Kausalya) is a US citizen who loves India and its culture and stays with her relatives to learn Bharatnatyam. She is a soft-natured, loving girl who loves to help people in distress but cannot stand it if anyone lies or cheats. Initially when these two meet, she mistakes Nataraj to be a mute and pities him. Shweta's occasional friendlier association with Nataraj, in the means of helping, gradually blossoms into love. By this time, it is too late for the guilt-ridden Nataraj to disclose the truth as he feared the risk of losing her. Despite all his efforts to reveal the truth, Shwetha comes to know of his sham by herself. However at the end, she realises Nataraj's true intentions for acting as a mute and forgives him. However at the climax, when Shwetha asks Nadaraj to speak to her, he keeps silent because he had asked a doctor to cut his tongue so that he could be the Nataraj that Swetha had come to love. ==Cast== * Livingston as Nataraj * Kausalya as Shweta * Karan as Vikram * Vivek as Wilson * Anand as Riyaz * Sakthi Kumar as Vaiyapuri * Prakash Raj as Dr. Surya Prakash * Dhamu as Shanmugam, painter * Vaiyapuri as Painter * Fathima Babu as Vikram's mother * Mohan Ram as Vikram's father * Lavanya as Shweta's friend * Crane Manohar as Hairdresser * Bava Lakshmanan * M.

She was connected to the Blue Stockings Society, and after bereavements in the 1790s began to edit family papers, and write on her own account. ==Biography== She was born in 1734 at the vicarage of White Waltham in Windsor Forest. Her father, the vicar, was the Rev. Henry Frinsham, previously curate at Beaconsfield; her mother was a daughter of Francis Cherry of Shottesbrook House, Berkshire, who left a fortune, diminished by the South Sea Bubble, to Mrs. Frinsham and her sisters, known as Duke Cherry, Black Cherry, and Heart Cherry. Lord Bute rented Waltham Place to be near Henry Frinsham, and he frequently played cards at the vicarage. Here Eliza Berkeley passed her childhood, since her father would not accept preferment on condition of voting against his principles. A tomboy at six, Eliza at 11 wrote two sermons. She and her sister Anne were placed at Mrs. Sheeles's school, Queen Square, London. for a year, until their father's death. She read Hickes's Preparatory Office for Death every Thursday, and attended prayers at church every afternoon.' In 1754, Eliza being in her twentieth year, her mother died. She and her sister succeeded to her large fortune, and they took a house in Windsor. She was a little creature, and very short-sighted; she read Spanish, Hebrew, and French, always taking a Spanish prayer-book to church. She was intimate with Catherine Talbot, and she knew Elizabeth Carter, Elizabeth Montagu, George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, and the rest of their set. In 1761 Eliza married the Rev. George Berkeley. Her husband's livings during the first ten years of her married life were Bray, Acton, and Cookham. In 1763 at Bray, on 8 February, she gave birth to her son, George Monck Berkeley, having at this time ague, and being exposed to the danger of smallpox, which was then endemic. In 1766 she gave birth to her second son, George Robert, and after weaning him she was inoculated at Acton rectory by Mr. Sutton, and devoted herself to the education of these two sons. In 1771 Dr. Berkeley became prebendary of Canterbury, and they then went to reside at The Oaks, the area at Canterbury Cathedral which had once been the monastery garden. Eliza, supported by her friend Susanna Duncombe, became a dominant figure in the group of wives of the chapter. On 15 April 1775 her second son George Robert, nearly nine years old, died. After their son (George) Monck had been to Eton College, the family went to live in Scotland during the time he passed at the University of St Andrews. From 1780 Monck's health caused anxiety, and for ten years from this, Eliza Berkeley moved around England in a group with husband, sister, and her son; but in January 1793 Monck died. In January 1795 her husband died, and in January 1797 her sister died. She became markedly eccentric. Eliza Berkeley dates from several places in the last three years of her life, Chertsey, Henley, Oxford, Sackville Street; she died at Kensington in 1800, aged 66. By her own desire her body, which was first to be taken to Oxford, was conveyed to Cheltenham and buried there in the same tomb with her son. She was charitable, and with other benevolent works she paid an annuity up to her death to Richard Brenan, who had been Jonathan Swift's servant at the end of his life. ==Works== Eliza Berkeley edited a volume of the poetical works of her son, and sermons of her husband's (1799). She was also an opinionated contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine. In 1797, her edition of her sons Poems was published, by John Nichols. The Preface of 630 pages, ostensibly a memoir of the poet, was personal and discursive, and at the time of publication was taken to be absurd. The poems cover 178 pages; there is also a postscript. ==Family== In 1761, Eliza married the Rev. George Berkeley (1733‚Äì1795), son of Bishop George Berkeley. They had two sons: * George Monck Berkeley (1763‚Äì1793) * George Robert Berkeley (1766‚Äì1775) ==References== ;Attribution Category:1734 births Category:1800 deaths Category:18th-century English writers Category:18th-century British women writers Category:English women writers Category:People from White Waltham ","title":"Eliza Berkeley"},{"id":"35171125","text":"Majidabad () may refer to: *Majidabad, Nir, Ardabil Province *Majidabad, Parsabad, Ardabil Province *Majidabad, Ahar, East Azerbaijan Province *Majidabad, Malekan, East Azerbaijan Province *Majidabad, Marand, East Azerbaijan Province *Majidabad, Hamadan *Majidabad, Isfahan *Majidabad, Kerman *Majidabad, Khuzestan *Majidabad, Dehgolan, Kurdistan Province *Majidabad, Kamyaran, Kurdistan Province *Majidabad, Qorveh, Kurdistan Province *Majidabad-e Ardalan, Qorveh County, Kurdistan Province *Majidabad, Khondab, Markazi Province *Majidabad, Saveh, Markazi Province *Majidabad, Mazandaran *Majidabad, Qazvin *Majidabad, Qom *Majidabad, Razavi Khorasan *Majidabad, Sistan and Baluchestan *Majidabad, Zanjan ==See also== *Majdabad (disambiguation) ","title":"Majidabad"},{"id":"35171139","text":"Neyzar (, also Romanized as NeyzƒÅr, Nayzar, and NƒÅzar) is a village in Neyzar Rural District, Salafchegan District, Qom County, Qom Province, Iran.

It comes as a free software, licensed under the GNU GPL v2. RozoFS uses erasure coding for redundancy. == Design == Rozo provides an open source POSIX filesystem, built on top of distributed file system architecture similar to Google File System, Lustre or Ceph. The Rozo specificity lies in the way data is stored. The data to be stored is translated into several chunks using Mojette Transform and distributed across storage devices in such a way that it can be retrieved even if several pieces are unavailable. On the other hand, chunks are meaningless alone. Redundancy schemes based on coding techniques like the one used by RozoFS allow to achieve significant storage savings as compared to simple replication. The file system comprises three components: * Exports server ‚Äî (Meta Data Server) manages the location (layout) of chunks (managing capacity load balancing with respect to high availability), file access and namespace (hierarchy). Multiple replicated metadata servers are used to provide failover. The Exports server is a user-space daemon; the metadata are stored synchronously to a usual file system (the underlying file system must support extended attributes). * Storage servers ‚Äî (Chunk Server) store the chunks. The Chunk server is also a user-space daemon that relies on the underlying local file system to manage the actual storage. * Clients ‚Äî talk to both the exports server and chunk servers and are responsible for data transformation. Clients mount the file system into user-space via FUSE.

S√° was a scrivener on the first Portuguese voyage to India, traveling on the carrack S√£o Rafael which was captained by Vasco da Gama's younger brother, Paulo da Gama. S√° was also a member of the group who accompanied Gama on his first trip into Calicut on 20 May 1498. On the return voyage the S√£o Rafael was scuttled off the East African coast, and the crew re-distributed to the remaining two ships, the S√£o Gabriel and the Berrio, as by this point there were not enough crewmen left standing to manage all three ships. This was due to the loss of almost half the crew during the voyage across the Indian Ocean, and to scurvy being rife amongst the survivors. Jo√£o de S√° transferred to the S√£o Gabriel. Later on, after having sailed around Africa, S√° was given command of the ship because Vasco da Gama decided to remain at Santiago island with his brother Paulo, who had fallen seriously ill. The S. Gabriel under S√° arrived in Lisbon sometime in late July or early August. Although Paulo was later able to travel on with his brother towards Portugal, he died whilst en route and was buried at the monastery of S√£o Francisco in Angra do Heroismo. Jo√£o de S√° is one of the purported authors of the anonymous Journal of Vasco Da Gama's trip of 1497 (the other being √Ålvaro Velho). This work survives in a single manuscript copy preserved at the Biblioteca P√∫blica Municipal of Porto and first published in Porto in 1838 by Diogo Kopke. In 1945, historian Franz H√ºmmerich identified the author of this manuscript with an √Ålvaro Velho who had spent eight years in Guinea and provided information about the Gambia region to Valentim Fernandes. However, more recent studies by Carmen Radulet have exposed weaknesses in this theory and attributed the Journal with more certainty to scrivener Jo√£o de S√°. Like Vasco da Gama, Jo√£o de S√° appears to have been closely associated with the Almeida family. It is believed that he spent some time at Safi (North Africa) after his return from India, possibly at the same time as being criado to the Bishop of Coimbra, D. Jorge de Almeida. Between February 1511 and April 1514, de S√°, who was a trained scrivener, was the treasurer of spices in the Casa da √çndia. He had also become a cavalier by royal letter in January 1512. == See also == *Portuguese India Armadas *Portuguese India *Spice trade == References == Editions of the Journal: * Diogo Kopke and Antonio da Costa Paiva (eds.), \\"Roteiro da viagem que em descobrimento da India pelo Cabo da Boa Esperan√ßa fez dom Vasco da Gama em 1497\\": Segundo um manuscripto da Bibliotheca publica portuense, Porto: Typographia Commercial Portuense, 1838 (first edition of the manuscript, in Portuguese).

The school, which had been established by Moravian missionaries, was in Tennessee, from their home in Alabama. Brown later worked with Catharine in educating and Christianizing their native tribe. Brown was a preacher and interpreter, and also acted as secretary of the Cherokee national government. In November 1819, he assisted John Arch in the preparation and printing of a Cherokee spelling book. He established a mission at Creek Path, Mississippi in 1820. In the spring of 1820, Brown went to Cornwall, Connecticut, to attend school. After two years there, he spent a year at Andover Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, preparing for ministry work. Returning to his birthplace, Brown began his missionary work converting the Cherokee people to Christianity. According to a letter written by him in 1825, the Christian religion was generally adopted by the tribe. Brown died September 14, 1829 in Creek Path; he died before the Cherokee people were dispossessed of most of their eastern lands by the United States government in defiance of treaty obligations. ==NotesReferences== * * This source seems to echo the Appletons' presentation. ==External links== * * Category:1800s births Category:1829 deaths Category:Cherokee people Category:Cherokee Nation (1794‚Äì1907) Category:American translators Category:American clergy Category:19th-century translators Category:Andover Theological Seminary alumni Category:Writers from Alabama ","title":"David Brown (translator)"},{"id":"35171274","text":"R√©gine Hantelle better known by her stage name Ana√Øs (born 1 March 1965 in Paris, France) is a French singer.

Vietnamese immigration has occurred in Greater Houston, including Fort Bend County and Harris County, since 1975, after the Vietnam War ended and refugees began coming to the United States.Vu p. 28. The earlier groups of refugees to Harris County, consisting of politicians, highly educated professionals, and military officers, arrived in the 1970s. Subsequent groups arriving in the 1980s and 1990s had less education and fewer resources than the earlier group of refugees.Lee, Ren√©e C. \\"Report shows Asians a growing force in Houston.\\" Houston Chronicle. February 8, 2013. Retrieved on February 11, 2013. ==History== 1970s through 1990s In early 1975, fewer than 100 ethnic Vietnamese lived in Greater Houston. They included thirty to fifty students, twenty to forty wives of former U.S. servicemen, and some teachers. The first wave of immigration arrived in Houston after the end of the Vietnam War, when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese on April 30, 1975. Thousands of Vietnamese people who had affiliations to the South Vietnamese government fled Vietnam. The first wave consisted of a higher proportion of managers and professionals and a smaller proportion of blue-collar workers than the average population of Vietnam. Douglas Pike, a historian, said that the people were \\"urban, upper class, well-educated, and familiar with American lifestyles.\\" Many Vietnamese were flown to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, before being transferred to Houston. The federal refugee resettlement system established by the Indochinese Assistance and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, which was active from 1975 to 1988, designated Houston as a major resettling site for Vietnamese.Rodriguez, p. 40. Texas received many Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s because it had a warm climate, an expanding economy, and a location in proximity to the ocean. Vietnamese from fishing and shrimping backgrounds saw Houston as a good settlement point due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. The first wave, compared to the later two waves, was more highly educated, had more knowledge about American society, and had relatively more capital. Because, at that time, the American population felt \\"war guilt\\", the first wave received a more positive reception than the other two waves. With the Vietnamese immigrant waves after the Vietnam War, the U.S. government provided housing, health care, transportation, welfare assistance, initial education, and job training. Nestor Rodriguez, author of \\"Hispanic and Asian Immigration Waves in Houston\\", wrote that the \\"majority of credit\\" for successfully resettling Vietnamese and Indochinese in Houston was given to charitable and religious organizations and individuals.41. The tasks the organizations and individuals did included acquainting refugees with the culture of the United States, and assistance in finding jobs and housing for them. Private organizations such as Catholic Charities, Protestant groups and congregations, International Rescue Committee, Jewish groups and congregations, and the YMCA provided assistance to refugees. Sometimes private organizations received assistance from the government.Rodriguez, p. 40-41. In the 1970s thousands of Vietnamese refugees moved to Allen Parkway Village,Swartz, Mimi. \\"Murder in the Melting Pot.\\" Texas Monthly. Emmis Communications, December 1991. Vol. 19, No. 12.

In areas in Greater Houston along the Gulf Coast some white residents had animosity towards Vietnamese fishermen. Around the late 1970s in Seabrook, Texas, a Ku Klux Klan group held an anti- Vietnamese rally, and in an incident two Vietnamese fishing boats were burned. The second wave consisted of \\"boat people\\" who came from 1978 to 1982. They were socioeconomically poorer than the first wave, and their children did not have as high of a performance in academics as the children of the first-wave immigrants had. Stephen Klineberg, a sociologist, said that of the Vietnamese that received Asian surveys, 47% completed the interviews in Vietnamese. Many members of the second wave were Vietnamese of Chinese descent. As of June 2, 1980, the Vietnamese had become a significant ethnic minority in the area. With about 25,000 Vietnamese at that time, Greater Houston had the second highest Vietnamese population in the United States, after Greater Los Angeles.\\"Houston Becoming Burgeoning Vietnamese Society.\\" The New York Times News Service at The Times-News. June 2, 1980. Page 24. Retrieved from Google News (13 of 56) on April 1, 2012. Of the Vietnamese not born in the United States, 11 persons had entered the U.S. before 1950, while 95% of the number of foreign-born Vietnamese had entered the U.S. since 1975. Many of the Vietnamese refugees in Houston had experienced trauma in their journeys to the U.S. and had experienced problems with families and personal issues after settling in the United States. Out of 114 Vietnamese women who were a part of a late 1980s study of refugee women in Houston, the majority reported having problems with family, finances, and/or health and/or reported being depressed, nervous, and/or anxious. Demand for use of Vietnamese-speaking officers of the Houston Police Department (HPD) increased in the 1980s as the city's Vietnamese population increased.Hanson, Eric. \\"No failure to communicate with the police / HPD's multilingual officers discover language talents often useful, necessary.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Houston's Vietnamese population was growing in the 1980s, and officers often faced language barriers. Nguyen, assigned to the west side division, soon found that his phone never stopped ringing. 'They called me all the time. In the middle of the night, all the time,' he said. His language skills were in such demand that even though he was fresh out of the academy Nguyen was working on major investigations.\\" The third wave consisted of former political prisoners and detainees from Vietnam. In 1988 the Vietnamese government began releasing political prisoners and detainees en masse after U.S. government intervention. The political prisoners had mental and physical illnesses due to imprisonment, and they had the most difficult time fitting in to the United States. In 1990 in Greater Houston there were 33,000 ethnic Vietnamese, including those born in the United States and those born abroad. Within the city of Houston, that year there were 18,453 ethnic Vietnamese, with 84% of them being born outside of the United States. As of 1990 the Vietnamese, along with the Chinese, were one of the two largest Asian immigrant groups to Houston,Rodriguez, p. 37-38. with 15,568 Vietnamese living there.Rodriguez, p. 37. Rodriguez wrote that because the Vietnamese started building their institutions in Houston in the 1970s while the Chinese had already been established in Houston, \\"the Vietnamese in the Houston area have not reached the same level of mainstream incorporation in the late 1990s that the Chinese have.\\" By December 1991 over 60,000 Vietnamese persons resided in Houston.Swartz, Mimi. \\"Murder in the Melting Pot.\\" Texas Monthly.

Of the larger villages, five are on Broadway Street and Park Place Boulevard in southeast Houston.Vu, p. 28-29 ==Areas of Vietnamese settlement== Saigon Plaza in the new Chinatown The original Vietnamese area in Houston, \\"Vinatown\\", was established next to the George R. Brown Convention Center, in proximity to the Old Chinatown. By the end of the 1980s, the Vietnamese businesses had moved to Milam Street in what is now Midtown. This area became known as \\"Vietnamtown\\". By 1991 this Little Saigon had Vietnamese restaurants, hair salons, car shops, and travel agencies, and as of 2000 businesses there included grocery stores, medical and legal offices, restaurants, music and video stores, hair styling shops, business service offices, and jewelry stores. Mimi Swartz of Texas Monthly stated in 1991 that in what is now Midtown, \\"Little Saigon is a place to begin easing into a new country.\\" Due to the actions of a group of Vietnamese-American leaders led by My Michael Cao, who served as the President of the Vietnamese Community of Houston and Vicinity (VNCH), a resolution that installed Vietnamese street signs along Milam Street in Midtown was passed. Vietnamese street signs have denoted the area since 1998. In 2004, this area was officially named \\"Little Saigon\\" by the city of Houston. The redevelopment of Midtown Houston from run-down to upscale increased property values and property taxes, forcing many Vietnamese-American businesses out of the neighborhood into other areas. (). In 2010 Denny Lee of The New York Times wrote that \\"traces\\" of the Vietnamese community remained. The largest Vietnamese commercial district is now found in suburban Alief, along Bellaire Boulevard west of the city of Bellaire, with Vietnamese-owned businesses and restaurants concentrated between Texas State Highway Beltway 8 and South Kirkwood Road. Although the area today is now known simply as Chinatown to most Houstonians, locals still call this southwest area of Houston \\"Bellaire\\". The city of Houston has formally renamed the area the International District (Greater Houston). Although the area is primarily Vietnamese and Chinese, there are also large numbers of Filipino Americans, Arab Americans, Indonesian Americans, and Pakistani Americans in the area, as well as a sizable number of African Americans, who were once the majority in the Little Saigon area prior to the Vietnam War. In 2016 Steve Le, a member of the Houston City Council for District F, proposed creating a \\"Little Saigon\\" district, consisting of commercial areas along Bellaire Boulevard from Cook Road to Turtlewood.Turner, Allan. \\"Plan to create \\"Little Saigon District\\" on Bellaire Blvd. draws mixed reaction.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Jessica Chew, author of \\"Vietnamese and Chinese American Cultures: Destination Houston,\\" wrote that \\"In Houston, the shrimping business acted as a central part of the Vietnamese community, which was familiar with the trade.\\"Chew, Jessica, p. 22. In 1990 the median household income of Vietnamese people in Harris County was $22,284. In 1990 18% of Vietnamese workers in Harris County had bachelor's degrees. In 1990, the median income of a Vietnamese household in Fort Bend County was $39,318. As of 1990, Vietnamese in Houston had a more numerous presence in craft and manual occupations and a less numerous presence in high-skilled administrative, managerial, and professional occupations than the Chinese did, and the Vietnamese had a greater occupational distribution than the Chinese. The presence of Vietnamese immigrants led to the development of Vietnamese restaurants throughout Houston. Some establishments from Vietnamese restaurateurs offer Vietnamese-style crawfish, a mixture of Louisiana cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine.Shilcutt, Katharine. \\"The Pho- ndamentals.\\" Houston Press.

Carl Bankston, an associate professor of Asian studies and sociology at Tulane University, said in 2004 that ethnic Vietnamese are disproportionately employed in fishing, seafood processing, and shrimping in the Gulf Coast area. Around 1974 Vietnamese immigrants began coming to the Gulf Coast to work in the shrimping industry. Therefore many ethnic Vietnamese entered the fishing trade and related businesses.Walsh, Robb. \\"Southern-Fried Asian to Go.\\" Houston Press. Thursday August 5, 2004. 1.

He is believed to be England's first black member of parliament and the first black Lord Mayor of London. ==Life and political career== James Townsend (center) in 1769 as alderman of the City of London. Frederick Bull. James Townsend was baptised on 8 February 1737 at the church of St. Christopher-le-Stocks in London.Ancestry.com. England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538‚Äì1975 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, 2014. He was the son of London merchant (and later MP) Chauncy Townsend and his wife Bridget Phipps. He attended Hertford College, Oxford in 1756. In politics James Townsend was closely linked from the 1760s with the Whig grandee William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. Supported by Shelburne, he entered Parliament as Member for West Looe at a by-election in 1767, holding the seat until 1774. In 1769, Townsend was elected alderman of the City of London for Bishopsgate ward and Sheriff of the City of London, becoming one of the leaders of the Whig party in London. In 1771 Townsend followed John Horne Tooke in breaking away from the Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights, which had been created to support John Wilkes after his expulsion from the House of Commons, and of which Townsend was a co-founder. He turned from a friend of Wilkes's to one of his fiercest opponents.[Thomas, P. D. G. (2006): \\"Townsend, James (bap.1737, d.1787), politician'. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Townsend was elected Lord Mayor of London in 1772. Wilkes had come first in the polls but Sheriff Richard Oliver manipulated the voting process to prevent the election of Wilkes. This created political turmoil in the City and a mob incensed by Townsend's coup rioted outside Guildhall during the ball on Lord Mayor's Day. Townsend's arms were erased from the church of St Helen's Bishopsgate. John Wilkes was eventually elected Lord Mayor in 1774. In 1781, Townsend presented a petition for electoral reform from the Tiverton activist Martin Dunsford. Townsend ran unsuccessfully for Parliament for the City of London in the general election of 1780, and in April 1782, Shelburne arranged for Townsend's election to Parliament for the pocket borough of Calne. As a member he backed some calls for reform, but mainly supported William Pitt the Younger. Shortly before his death in office he had opposed the impeachment of Warren Hastings. Townsend died at his estate, Bruce Castle in Tottenham, on 1 July 1787. He was buried nearby at Old Church Tottenham in the mausoleum of his wife's family, the Coleraines. Her inheritance had made him a wealthy man. ==Family== Townsend's mother Bridget (died 1762), who clandestinely married Chauncy Townsend in the Fleet Prison in 1730,London, England, Clandestine Marriage and Baptism Registers, 1667‚Äì1754. Provo UT: Ancestry.com was the daughter of James Phipps, who came from a prominent family of clothiers in Westbury, Wiltshire. At the age of sixteen, James Phipps entered the service of the Royal African Company of England (RAC) which traded slaves across the Atlantic between 1660 and 1752. Phipps lived on the Gold Coast for twenty years and died at Cape Coast Castle, the African headquarters of the RAC, in 1723. He became the highest-ranking RAC official in Africa before being removed from his post among accusations of embezzlement and abuse of power. At Cape Coast James Phipps married Catherine, the daughter of an African woman and a white soldier in the service of the Dutch West India Company. In spite of being generously provided for in her husband's will,Will of James Phipps, Captain General for the Royal African Company of England of Cabo Corso Castle on the Coast of Guinea, West Africa. The National Archives, PROB 11/607/92. Catherine Phipps refused to move to England and died at Cape Coast in 1738. James and Catherine's children, including James Townsend's mother Bridget, were all of mixed race, so James Townsend has been claimed as Britain's first black member of parliament and as the first black Lord Mayor of London. It does not appear that this aspect of Townsend's family history was known at the time. Bruce Castle, Tottenham, James Townsend's estate. He redesigned the east fa√ßade, depicted here. In 1763 James Townsend married Henrietta Rosa Peregrina du Plessis (1745‚Äì1785), the illegitimate daughter of Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine, and Rose du Plessis Henrietta Rosa was her father's heiress, but the estate escheated to the Crown because she was an alien. By means of his father's influence with Henry Fox, Townsend had the estate restored to him by private Act of Parliament. Bruce Castle, Townsend's house in Tottenham, was part of his wife's inheritance, and he redesigned parts of the building. They had one son, Henry Hare, and one daughter, Henrietta Jemima. Henry Hare Townsend (1766‚Äì1827) married Charlotte Winter Lake, daughter of Sir James Lake, bart. and sister of Admiral Sir Willoughby Lake. Their son was the poet and writer Chauncy Hare Townshend (who spelt his surname thus) to whom Dickens dedicated Great Expectations.

Although its origins are unknown, the song was relatively popular during the 1920s as a religious tune, and it became a gospel hit in the late 1930s for singer-guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe. After switching from acoustic to electric guitar, Tharpe released a more secular version of the song in the early 1950s. The song's popularity was also due in part to the influence of folklorists John A. Lomax and Alan Lomax, who discovered the song while making field recordings in the American South in the early 1930s and included it in folk song anthologies that were published in 1934 and 1960. These anthologies brought the song to the attention of an even broader audience during the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s. ==Early history== The earliest known example of \\"This Train\\" is a recording by Florida Normal and Industrial Institute Quartette from 1922, under the title \\"Dis Train\\". Another one of the earliest recordings of the song is the version made by Wood's Blind Jubilee Singers in August 1925 under the title \\"This Train Is Bound for Glory\\". Between 1926 and 1931, three other black religious groups recorded it. During a visit to the Parchman Farm state penitentiary in Mississippi in 1933, Smithsonian Institution musicologist John A. Lomax and his son Alan made a field recording of the song by black inmate Walter McDonald. The next year the song found its way into print for the first time in the Lomaxes' American Folk Songs and Ballads anthology and was subsequently included in Alan Lomax's 1960 anthology Folk Songs of North America. In 1935, the first hillbilly recording of the song was released by Tennessee Ramblers as \\"Dis Train\\" in reference to the song's black roots. Then in the late 1930s, after becoming the first black artist to sign with a major label, gospel singer and guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded \\"This Train\\" as a hit for Decca. Her later version of the song, released by Decca in the early 1950s, featured Tharpe on electric guitar and is cited as one of several examples of her work that led to the emergence of rock 'n roll. In 1955, the song, with altered lyrics, became a popular single for blues singer-harmonica player Little Walter Jacobs as \\"My Babe\\". This secular adaptation has since become a rock standard recorded by many artists, including Dale Hawkins, Bo Diddley, Cliff Richard (three times), and The Remains. ==Other recordings== Over the years, \\"This Train\\" has been covered by artists specializing in numerous genres, including blues, folk, bluegrass, gospel, rock, post-punk, jazz, reggae, and zydeco. Among the solo artists and groups who have recorded it are Louis Armstrong, Big Bill Broonzy, Brothers Four, Hylo Brown, Alice Coltrane, Delmore Brothers, Sandy Denny, D.O.A., Lonnie Donegan, Jimmy Durante, Snooks Eaglin, Bob Gibson, Joe Glazer, John Hammond, Jr., Cisco Houston, Janis Ian, Johnny Cash, Mahalia Jackson, Ella Jenkins, Sleepy LaBeef, The Limeliters, Trini Lopez, Bob Marley & The Wailers, Ziggy Marley, The Alarm, Ricky Nelson, Peter, Paul & Mary, Utah Phillips, Pete Seeger, The Seekers, Roberta Sherwood, Hank Snow, David Soul, Staples Singers, Billy Strange, the Tarriers, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Hank Thompson, Bradley Nowell of Sublime, Randy Travis, The Verlaines, Bunny Wailer, Nina Hagen, Girls at Our Best!, Buckwheat Zydeco, The Paul Mirfin Band, Jools Holland, and University of Exeter Contemporary Choir. ==Additional influences== The song provided the inspiration for the title of Woody Guthrie's autobiographical novel Bound for Glory. The book was subsequently used as the basis for director Hal Ashby's 1976 film Bound for Glory on Guthrie's life, which starred David Carradine in the lead role. Sister Rosetta Tharpe's 1950s version of \\"This Train\\" was featured as a selection on Bob Dylan's XM Satellite Radio program Theme Time Radio Hour, during its first season in 2006‚Äì2007. The song, which was played on Show 46, \\"More Trains\\", was later released on The Best of Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour, Volume 1 on the Chrome Dreams label. In mid-1970s in the USSR, Dean Reed made a TV clip version of \\"This Train\\" as a \\"gospel\\" of a kind in praise to the BAM - a grand Soviet Trans-Siberian railroad that was being built in that period. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtaTaJHrYpY Bruce Springsteen's 1999 song \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" used \\"This Train\\" as both a starting point and a departure point. In 2011, Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with \\"This Train\\". ==See also== * List of train songs ==NotesReferences== * * Category:Gospel songs Category:1925 songs Category:Songs about trains Category:Woody Guthrie songs Category:Peter, Paul and Mary songs Category:Bob Marley songs ","title":"This Train"},{"id":"35171614","text":"Black at the 2017 Texas Book Festival.

The charge inducing the bending is balanced by a layer of negative acceptor-ion charge (right). Bottom panel: A larger applied voltage further depletes holes but conduction band lowers enough in energy to populate an inversion layer. In physics, the field effect refers to the modulation of the electrical conductivity of a material by the application of an external electric field. In a metal, the electron density that responds to applied fields is so large that an external electric field can penetrate only a very short distance into the material. However, in a semiconductor the lower density of electrons (and possibly holes) that can respond to an applied field is sufficiently small that the field can penetrate quite far into the material. This field penetration alters the conductivity of the semiconductor near its surface, and is called the field effect. The field effect underlies the operation of the Schottky diode and of field-effect transistors, notably the MOSFET, the JFET and the MESFET.The acronyms stand for Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor, Junction Field Effect Transistor, and MEtal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor. For a discussion see, for example, ==Surface conductance and band bending== The change in surface conductance occurs because the applied field alters the energy levels available to electrons to considerable depths from the surface, and that in turn changes the occupancy of the energy levels in the surface region. A typical treatment of such effects is based upon a band-bending diagram showing the positions in energy of the band edges as a function of depth into the material. An example band-bending diagram is shown in the figure. For convenience, energy is expressed in eV and voltage is expressed in volts, avoiding the need for a factor q for the elementary charge. In the figure, a two-layer structure is shown, consisting of an insulator as left-hand layer and a semiconductor as right-hand layer. An example of such a structure is the MOS capacitor, a two-terminal structure made up of a metal gate contact, a semiconductor body (such as silicon) with a body contact, and an intervening insulating layer (such as silicon dioxide, hence the designation O). The left panels show the lowest energy level of the conduction band and the highest energy level of the valence band. These levels are \\"bent\\" by the application of a positive voltage V. By convention, the energy of electrons is shown, so a positive voltage penetrating the surface lowers the conduction edge. A dashed line depicts the occupancy situation: below this Fermi level the states are more likely to be occupied, the conduction band moves closer to the Fermi level, indicating more electrons are in the conducting band near the insulator. Bulk region The example in the figure shows the Fermi level in the bulk material beyond the range of the applied field as lying close to the valence band edge. This position for the occupancy level is arranged by introducing impurities into the semiconductor. In this case the impurities are so-called acceptors which soak up electrons from the valence band becoming negatively charged, immobile ions embedded in the semiconductor material. The removed electrons are drawn from the valence band levels, leaving vacancies or holes in the valence band. Charge neutrality prevails in the field-free region because a negative acceptor ion creates a positive deficiency in the host material: a hole is the absence of an electron, it behaves like a positive charge. Where no field is present, neutrality is achieved because the negative acceptor ions exactly balance the positive holes. Surface region Next the band bending is described. A positive charge is placed on the left face of the insulator (for example using a metal \\"gate\\" electrode). In the insulator there are no charges so the electric field is constant, leading to a linear change of voltage in this material. As a result, the insulator conduction and valence bands are therefore straight lines in the figure, separated by the large insulator energy gap. In the semiconductor at the smaller voltage shown in the top panel, the positive charge placed on the left face of the insulator lowers the energy of the valence band edge. Consequently, these states are fully occupied out to a so-called depletion depth where the bulk occupancy reestablishes itself because the field cannot penetrate further. Because the valence band levels near the surface are fully occupied due to the lowering of these levels, only the immobile negative acceptor-ion charges are present near the surface, which becomes an electrically insulating region without holes (the depletion layer). Thus, field penetration is arrested when the exposed negative acceptor ion charge balances the positive charge placed on the insulator surface: the depletion layer adjusts its depth enough to make the net negative acceptor ion charge balance the positive charge on the gate. Inversion The conduction band edge also is lowered, increasing electron occupancy of these states, but at low voltages this increase is not significant. At larger applied voltages, however, as in the bottom panel, the conduction band edge is lowered sufficiently to cause significant population of these levels in a narrow surface layer, called an inversion layer because the electrons are opposite in polarity to the holes originally populating the semiconductor. This onset of electron charge in the inversion layer becomes very significant at an applied threshold voltage, and once the applied voltage exceeds this value charge neutrality is achieved almost entirely by addition of electrons to the inversion layer rather than by an increase in acceptor ion charge by expansion of the depletion layer. Further field penetration into the semiconductor is arrested at this point, as the electron density increases exponentially with band-bending beyond the threshold voltage, effectively pinning the depletion layer depth at its value at threshold voltages. ==References== Category:Semiconductors Category:Semiconductor technology Category:Semiconductor structures Category:Electronic band structures Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Concepts in physics Category:MOSFETs ","title":"Field effect (semiconductor)"},{"id":"35171753","text":"A Resident of the City is a 2011 Egyptian film directed by Adham El Sherif. ==Theme== In the city, some lead a privileged life, whilst others are mere labour.

Under his leadership, the Centre's project of creating a new exhibition space devoted to French artists in the basement of the Palais de Tokyo was turned down by Minister for Culture and Communication Christine Albanel, who favoured the extension of the already existing contemporary art space, nevertheless the number of visitors coming to the Centre spectacularly increased, reaching 3.6 million in 2011 (+40% between 2007 and 2011), notably thanks to large exhibitions such as those devoted to Kandisky, Calder, Soulages, Lucian Freud or Mondrian/de Stijl, and to a significant increase of its own resources (+50% between 2007 and 2009). In 2009, the centre renewed the presentation of its contemporary collections with elles@pompidou, exclusively devoted to female artists, which attracted 2.5 million visitors until it was renewed in February 2011.

They are a species-rich group with highest diversity in the tropical and subtropical mountains, especially the Andes. Before 1970, they were poorly studied, but recent interest has resulted in high rates of species description from previously unexplored mountain ranges. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on their biology and ecology. Their relationship to other groups of Satyrine butterflies and their complex patterns of speciation within and among mountain ranges have led to several biogeographic discussions. ==Systematics and taxonomy== Traditionally the name Pronophilini (or Pronophilidi) was used to describe a tribe of Neotropical satyrines, but modern arrangement place them as a subtribe within the tribe Satyrini of the Satyrinae.Lamas, G. 2004 Atlas of Neotropical Lepidoptera. CheckList: Part 4A Hesperioidea-Papilionoidea Scientific Publishers. The number of genera included in Pronophilina is disputed, since some genera were formally transferred to the subtribes Erebiina and Hypocystinas, but some authors reject this arrangement. Morphological analysis indicates there is a distinct core group of Pronophilina sensu stricto, and one or two additional groups (Neotropical Erebiina and Hypocystina in their original designation), but molecular analysis suggest they are each other's sister taxa and form a monophyletic group. Illustrations of New Species of Exotic Butterflies Pronophila VIII By the time Reuter proposed Pronophilidi as a formal tribe, there were some 230 described species. That number rose to 300 species by 1907, and 370 by 1970, primarily due to the work on museum and collection specimens by (in chronological order) William Chapman Hewitson, Cajetan Freiherr von Felder & Rudolf Felder, Arthur Gardiner Butler, Otto Staudinger, Theodor Otto Thieme and Gustav Weymer. More detailed field studies in the northern Andes by Adams and Bernard during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in many new taxa descriptions and a better understanding of their distribution and ecology and lead to an increased interest in this group after the 1990s. More than 100 species have been described since 1970, mostly due to contribution from A.L. Viloria, T.W. Pyrcz and G. Lamas, and it is estimated that the number of known taxa (including several yet unpublished species and subspecies descriptions) has nearly doubled in that period. ==Description== The subtribe Pronophilina can be separated from other American satyrines by the following three external morphological synapomorphies: eyes always densely hairy; hindwing cross vein m1-m2 always curved or angled basally into the discal cell; maximum length of hindwing discal cell equal to or longer than half the total maximum length of the hindwing (excluding tails). These characters separate the Pronophilina sensu stricto from other Neotropical montane satyrids previously included in the group. This arrangement has been adopted by Lamas, but phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data suggests a larger, more inclusive delimitation of Pronophilina is needed. The background color of most species is dominated by brown, dark gray or black, with few and slight distinctive features in the wings, but some species show colorful variations between white, yellow, orange, red and iridescent blue.

SchultzeA. Schultze 1929 \\"Die ersten St√§nde von drei kolumbianischen hochandinen Satyriden\\" Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift 'Iris 43: 157‚Äì165, 3 plates. described incomplete life histories for Pedaliodes phoenissa (Hewitson), Lymanopoda samius Westwood and Junea doraete (Hewitson). Other authors have observed oviposition on Chusquea (Poaceae) or other woody bamboos, or loosely over grass dominated vegetation. Early stages of several species found in Costa Rica were published by DeVries.P. J DeVries 1987 The butterflies of {Costa Rica} and their natural history. Papilionidae, {Pieridae}, Nymphalidae Princeton University PressPrinceton. Recently, life cycle description have been documented for Parapedaliodes parepa (Hewitson) in Ecuador, Pedaliodes zingara Viloria & Heredia in Colombia, Pedaliodes poesia (Hewitson) and Corades medeba Doubleday in Ecuador, and Daedalma dinias emma Pyrcz & Greeney and Daedalma rubroreducta Pyrcz & Willmott. ==Biotic associations== Host plants Chusquea cumingii All reported host plants are in the family Poaceae, with the genus Chusquea featuring prominently, and a few records in Cynodon, Saccharum, Bambusa, Guada, Rhipidocladum, Merostachys and Zea, among others.George W. Beccaloni, Angel Luis Viloria, Stephen R. Hall, and Gaden S. Robinson 2008 Catalogue of the hostplants of the Neotropical butterflies. Cat√°logo de las plantas hu√©sped de las mariposas neotropicales RIBES-CYTED / Sociedad Entomol√≥gica AragonesaZaragoza. Parasitism Parasitoids in the early stages of pronophiline butterflies have not been properly documented, although they might be locally important. Incidence of ectoparasitic Diptera (probably Ceratopogonidae) have been documented for seven species of the genera Corades, Lasiophila, Lymanopoda, Mygona and Pedaliodes. Mimicry There are 18 documented examples of convergent coloration patterns between coexisting pairs of pronophiline species from different genera (three examples), between pronophiline species and other satyrines (eight examples), and between pronophiline species and other butterflies or skippers (seven examples). Most examples involve species of Lymanopoda or Eretris. Some of these observations have been described as mimetic relationships, but the degree of resemblance is not so accurate as in other mimetic butterfly groups, there is no direct evidence of unpalatability of pronophiline butterflies, and no clear understanding of the ecological consequences of such resemblance. ==Diversity== Depending on the classification adopted, the pronophilini include between 592 and 711 species. This represents approximately 50-60% of the Neotropical, and 23-27% of the worldwide Satyrinae.G. Lamas 2008 La sistem√°tica sobre mariposas (Lepidoptera: Hesperioidea y Papilionoidea) en el mundo: estado actual y perspectivas futuras: 57-70. Most species have a geographically and altitudinally restricted distribution in the tropical and subtropical Andes, and other mountain ranges in Brazil, the Guayana Shield, Central America, and Mexico. The genus Calisto has a Caribbean distribution, and some other genera are distributed in Patagonia. ==Biogeography== The pronophilines have been involved in diverse biogeographical discussions that aim to explain their current distribution, diversity and endemism.A.L. Viloria 2003 \\"Historical biogeography and the origins of the satyrine butterflies of the tropical Andes (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera)\\", In: Llorente J. Morrone, J.J. (Eds.) Una perspectiva latinoamericana de la biogeograf√≠a Universidad Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, M√©xico. The high diversity within the Pronophilina, and the distinctive speciation patterns in mountain and Caribbean taxa, has also motivated discussion about parapatric and sympatric speciation.Michael J Adams 1985 Speciation in the pronophiline butterflies () of the northern {Andes} Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera Supl. 1: 33-49.. Origins The affinities of the Pronophilina to other species groups within the specious Satyrinae suggest different interpretations about its origin. Viloria reviewed morphological characters and separated three groups that might have different phylogenetic and biogeographic affinities: a major group of 39 true Neotropical Pronophilina, including the genus Calisto with a Caribbean distribution, eight genera related to the Holarctic Erebiina, and 19 genera which he placed as Neotropical representatives of the otherwise Australasian Hypocystina. This grouping would suggest an amphi-Pacific distribution of the Hypocystina, and imply a Gondwanan origin according to a panbiogegraphic interpretations. This hypothesis was rebutted after a large phylogenetic analysis of the Satyrinae recovered a representative sample of pronophiline genera as a monophyletic group, and suggested a completely Neotropical, or at least, a common origin for the group. However, the relationships of the group remain unresolved, as subsequent work has found that at least two genera ‚Äì Eretris, and the Caribbean Calisto‚Äîmight be closer related to Holarctic Satyrines, but larger taxonomic sampling and a better integration of molecular and morphological data is needed to rule out analytical artifacts. Speciation It has been observed that most mountain species, especially in the species-rich genera close to Pedaliodes, have very narrow altitudinal ranges, and are restricted to one or few mountain ranges. This leads to high turn-over of species along altitudinal gradients within a mountain range, and high turn-over between ranges. Most species appear to be more closely related to those occupying a similar altitudinal range in neighboring mountains, than to the species below or above.A.L. Viloria 1999 Studies on the systematics and biogeography of some montane satyrid butterflies (Lepidoptera). Imperial College, London. PhD Thesis A possible mechanism was proposed by Adams and extensively discussed by Viloria. This involves a series of alternative events of colonization and isolation that would be linked to repeated cycles of cold- wet and warm-dry climate (glaciations and interglaciation periods). The genus Calisto also shows a distinctive radiation in the Caribbean, where it is the only representative of the Satyrinae. At least 54 named taxa have been recognized, most of them restricted to particular habitats in the island of Hispaniola, with fewer species in Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. The diversification of Calisto is referred to as an example of adaptive radiation into contrasting habitat types. ==References== Category:Satyrini Category:Nymphalidae of South America Category:Lepidoptera subtribes ","title":"Pronophilina"},{"id":"35171920","text":"Bagh-e Yek (, also Romanized as BƒÅgh-e Yek and BƒÅgh Yek; also known as BƒÅghak and BƒÅqak) is a village in Rahjerd-e Sharqi Rural District, Salafchegan District, Qom County, Qom Province, Iran.

After publishing several books in collaboration with other authors, he published his first solo book, Men of Letters, in 2014. Barrett also works as an actor and theatre director. ==Early life== Duncan was born in Islington, London in 1983Birth certificate record at Ancestry.co.uk and went to City of London School from 1994 to 2001, before studying English at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he served as Film Editor of student newspaper Varsity. He is the author of Star Trek: The Human Frontier, co-written with his mother Michele Barrett and published by Polity Press in 2000. He edited Vitali Vitaliev's travelogue Passport to Enclavia, published by Reportage Press in 2008. ==Work as writer and editor== Barrett was the editor of Ronald Skirth's pacifist First World War memoir The Reluctant Tommy, published by Macmillan in 2010. In it he wrote that, having come across Skirth's memoir through his mother's research, he felt determined that it should be read by a wide audience. The book was favourably reviewed by Richard Holmes in the Evening Standard and Jonathan Gibbs in the Financial Times, Socialist Worker and the Sunday Express. However, it came under attack from critics who objected to its pacifist politics and questioned its accuracy. In a revised introduction to the paperback edition (2011), Barrett defended the memoir, encouraging people to \\"read the book for yourself and make up your own mind who to believe\\". In 2012, Collins published The Sugar Girls, a book co-written by Barrett with Nuala Calvi, telling the stories of women workers at Tate & Lyle's East End factories since the Second World War. It soon became a best-seller. In an article for History Workshop Online, Barrett wrote that, while their methodology was indebted to oral history, the end result was a work of narrative non-fiction. The authors were inspired by Jennifer Worth's Call the Midwife, which was their \\"touchstone\\" as they wrote.Call The Midwife, The Sugar Girls blog, 20 February 2012. The book is accompanied by a blog, where Barrett and Calvi discuss broader issues of life and work in the East End of London in the period covered by the book, as well as posting photographs and audio clips of the women they interviewed.The Sugar Girls Blog. In 2013, Barrett and Calvi's second book together, GI Brides, was published by Harper, based on interviews with British women who married Americans during the Second World War. It soon became a Sunday Times best-seller. The following year, a US edition of the book went into the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. Barrett and Calvi's third collaboration for HarperCollins, The Girls Who Went to War, tells the true stories of women who served in the Army, Navy and Air Force during the Second World War. The book was published on 7 May 2015, and launched the following day to commemorate the 70th anniversary of VE-Day. On 17 May 2015, it went into the Sunday Times bestseller list at number 6. In 2014, Barrett's first solo book, Men of Letters was published by AA Publishing. The book tells the story of the Post Office Rifles during the First World War. ==Work in theatre== Barrett also works as an actor and theatre director. He trained at Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating in 2006.The Alumni Newsletter, Central School of Speech and Drama, Summer 2008 In 2007 he played John Walker in Eastern Angles' production of Arthur Ransome's We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea and was praised for \\"neatly avoid[ing] any jolly hockeysticks\\". In 2011 he was seen as W. T. Tutte in the BBC's Code- breakers and in 2012 as Paul Winder in National Geographic's Locked up Abroad. Barrett has often worked on the plays of Shakespeare and other dramatists. He is the director of the short film Exit Strategy (2010), adapted from Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. He played Frederick in a production of Aphra Behn's The Rover at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006. The previous year he played the title role in Shakespeare's Richard II at the festival.

It grew in two decades to be one of the major engineering works in the London area.Richard Hartree (epilogue by Prudence Penn), John Penn and Sons of Greenwich, 2008, Landmark Publishing Ltd, The focus of the firm remained in agriculture until the 1830s and 1840s, when Penn's son, also John Penn, took over the company and it began to specialise in building marine steam engines. Marine steam Penn Jr was an inventor of engines. One of the earliest engines he produced was the grasshopper beam engine, a six horsepower version being the first steam engine to power the machinery at the works. He shifted the focus of the works to marine engines. His 40-horsepower beam engines were fitted in the paddle steamers 'Ipswich' and 'Suffolk', and it is likely these were the first marine engines to be designed and built by Penn. He then focussed on improving the oscillating engine from the version patented by Aaron Manby in 1821. In 1844 he replaced the engines of the Admiralty yacht, HMS Black Eagle with oscillating engines of double the power, without increasing either the weight or space occupied, an achievement which broke the naval supply dominance of Boulton & Watt and Maudslay, Son & Field. His enhanced reputation due to this notable advancement was further augmented by Penn's introduction of trunk engines for driving screw propellers in vessels of war. HMS Encounter (1846) and HMS Arrogant (1848) were the first ships to be fitted with such engines and such was their efficacy that by the time of Penn's death in 1878, the engines had been fitted in 230 ships. Initially, ships were adapted to incorporate these engines, but in 1851, the Navy ordered its first ship specifically designed as a steam- screw auxiliary, HMS Agamemnon. These advancements were coupled with a reputation for quality and reliability and this led to Penn becoming the major engine supplier to the Royal Navy as it made the transition from sail to steam. Penn was also responsible for introducing wood bearings for screw- propeller shafts which became vital to the worldwide use of steam-powered ships.Penn presented two papers on the subject to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1856 and 1858. This development of the lignum vitae stern bearing which enabled screw propeller ships to make oceanic voyages without wearing out their stern glands came in collaboration with Francis Pettit Smith. Other notable associations include his work on the application of superheated steam in marine engines. Penn also produced the trunk engine for HMS Warrior and during construction was requested to develop an engine design for the RN gunboats being readied for the Crimean War. Penn chose his trunk engine design and subsequently produced 90 sets of what were the first mass-produced, high-pressure and high-revolution marine engines.Osbon, G. A., 1965, The Crimean War gunboats. Part. 1. The Mariner's Mirror, The Journal of the Society of Nautical Research. 51, 103‚Äì116 & Preston, A., & Major, 1965, J., Send a gunboat. Longmans, London. At the Admiralty's insistence, they also used the Whitworth measurement standards throughout; Penn was a great friend of Joseph Whitworth, and employed the precision instruments and tools developed by him. The association with Whitworth was important in the development of mass-produced marine engines, as is clear from the obituary to Whitworth from The Times of 24 January 1887: :The Crimean War began, and Sir Charles Napier demanded of the Admiralty 120 gunboats, each with engines of 60 horsepower, for the campaign of 1855 in the Baltic. There were just ninety days in which to meet this requisition, and, short as the time was, the building of the gunboats presented no difficulty. It was otherwise however with the engines, and the Admiralty were in despair. Suddenly, by a flash of the mechanical genius which was inherent in him, the late Mr John Penn solved the difficulty, and solved it quite easily. :He had a pair of engines on hand of the exact size. He took them to pieces and he distributed the parts among the best machine shops in the country, telling each to make ninety sets exactly in all respects to the sample. The orders were executed with unfailing regularity, and he actually completed ninety sets of engines of 60 horsepower in ninety days ‚Äì a feat which made the great Continental Powers stare with wonder, and which was possible only because the Whitworth standards of measurement and of accuracy and finish were by that time thoroughly recognised and established throughout the country.Richard Hartree's history of John Penn & Sons (2008), though, describes the obituary as \\"a more graphic, factually inaccurate and almost mythical version of John Penn's contribution to gunboat engine manufacture\\" (p.43). The engine recovered from the wreck of the SS Xantho is of the gunboat type. Built (or assembled) in 1861, it is the only known example, and in being recovered intact was found to have all its fittings and fixtures attached including Penn's nameplate. It is on display at the Western Australian Museum. John Penn's firm was a major employer in the Greenwich area with 1800 employed at its Greenwich and Deptford works at its peak. John Penn and Sons was considered the best-equipped marine engineering works and Penn a model employer. He recognised the value of skilled employees through pensions and awarded Christmas gifts. His works also provided the education for a whole generation of marine engineers.

The combined company failed in 1912. ==References *Chronology of the company.

In 1984, the Mlambo family were forced to relocate by the government to make way for roads and he began drawing to remember his childhood home. He got a job in Beral and developed his skills in painting at the weekends and selling them to his colleagues. In 1985, a man named Dori whom he met at the Indingilizi Gallery recognized his talent and encouraged him to exhibit. The following year he did so at the gallery, with Lisa Forslund from Sweden. In 1991, Mlambo painted five murals at Indingilizi to depict the Reed Dance Ceremony. He has since showcased his works in Total Gallery in Johannesburg and University of Zululand in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Grahamstown Arts Festival, at the Swaziland Arts Society, and in Denmark and the United States. His paintings are noted for their bright colours, often in lively scenes, and generally capture every day life and landmarks in the country. Mlambo has said ‚ÄúMany people like my paintings. I like to use bright colours. In my work, you can see how people in Swaziland live and what they do. I like Mbabane very much because when I see the mountains I see something to paint. When I see the streets, people and buildings, I see something to paint. Even in the location where I stay, I find many stories to paint to show how the people live and what they do.‚Äù Notable works include After the Storm, Washing Day - Manzini, Nhlangano Town Mshengu St and Nhlangano - Old Bus Rank. Mlambo is married with a son and a daughter. ==References== Category:Swazi painters Category:People from Mbabane Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century painters Category:21st-century painters ","title":"Lucas Mlambo"},{"id":"35172087","text":"This list of mines in Poland is subsidiary to the list of mines article and lists working, defunct and future mines in the country and is organised by the primary mineral output.

It was founded in 1957 by Kwame Nkrumah as part of a \\"network of coercive and partisan institutions,\\" in a concerted effort to present a more favorable view of the country to the outside world and to control the flow of information nationally. The New York Times reported in 1964 that most of the agency's news came from Reuters (it had \\"only a few correspondents abroad\\"); the agency functioned as a gatekeeper in that it disseminated international news to the Ghanaian press, and deleted any international news critical of the Ghanaian leadership immediately, thus preventing such news from reaching the country's newspapers and radio stations. Until the rise of the Pan African News Agency, the GNA was considered one of the most efficient news agencies in Africa, spreading what Nkrumah called the \\"clear ideology of the African Revolution\\" and contributing to \\"African and Ghanaian emancipation.\\" Initially operating as a government department, the agency became a state corporation on the day Ghana was declared a republic, in 1960. While in general the Ghanaian media are hailed as relatively free, in 2001 still the GNA was claimed to be firmly pro-government. ==References * Category:1957 establishments in Ghana Category:News agencies based in Ghana ","title":"Ghana News Agency"},{"id":"35172251","text":"e-akustik is the third album by Turkish rock group maNga.

In 1882 the name was changed to Humphrys, Tennant and Co. of Deptford Pier, London. It specialised in building large marine steam engines and boilers, including those for the Navy's fast cruisers and iron-clad battleships. The 50 years of production started in the early days of screw-propellors (as opposed to paddle wheels) and spanned great changes in the available pressure from boilers and the resulting power of the engines, as well as in the construction and form of ships. Their main competitors were Maudslay, Sons and Field and John Penn and Sons. The works at Deptford Pier was closed in 1907. ==Early installations== One of the early records of a Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes steam engine was the conversion of the Russian ship of the line Konstantin to steam power between 1852 and 1854. The engine was rated at 450 nominal horsepower, and drove a single screw propellor. This early engine must have performed well, for when the Konstantin was retired in 1864 the engine was refurbished and installed in the Russian ironclad Ne Tron Menia, and its from the sea trials of this vessel in 1865 that we know the engine produced 1200 indicated horsepower (ihp). Fitted with new boilers in 1877, the sea trials showed the power improved to 1700 ihp. The layout and type of the Konstantin engine was probably similar to the pair of direct-acting engines displayed at the 1862 International Exhibition, reputedly intended for HMS North Star.The exhibited machinery of 1862: a cyclopaedia of the machinery represented at the International exhibition, D.K. Clark, 1862, p343-344 These were twin-cylinder non-compound horizontal engines with 64 inch cylinders and just 32 inches of stroke, allowing relatively short connecting rods. The crankshaft, of 13.5 inches diameter, was supported in 3 main bearings, each 25 inches long, on a single cast bedplate. Condenser air pumps were provided on the opposite side from the cylinders. Although rated as 400 nominal horsepower, with 24 psi steam (reflecting the very low marine boiler pressures typical at that time) the engine had shown 1834 ihp. Another early installation was in HMS Beagle (1854) (and possibly the other 5 Arrow-class gunvessels). The Beagle had a single screw propellor driven by a horizontal twin-cylinder expansion engine rated at 160 nhp. ==Woolf expansion engines exhibited in 1862== At the 1862 International Exhibition Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes showed details of the 4-cylinder expansion engines for the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ship Mooltan. The cylinders were steam jacketed and arranged in pairs using the Woolf compound system, with the smaller (43 inch diameter) cylinder being above the larger one (of 96 inch diameter). The 4 cylinders drove a single screw propellor 16 feet in diameter. The same type of engine was also fitted to the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation ship SS Carnatic, on which it had recorded 2442 indicated horsepower. Even though these engines were operated with only 20‚Äì25 psi steam pressure, the compound system was claimed to give significant benefits in economy. ==Horizontal twin- cylinder compound steam engines== This form of engine was supplied to the Navy's Fantome-class sloops (with the exception of HMS Daring) during 1873‚Äì1874. A single engine drove an 11-foot screw propellor and provided about 1000 indicated horsepower with a steam pressure of 60 psi. ==Three-cylinder single-expansion engines== In the late 1870s an extra cylinder was added for the Cornus-class corvettes HMS Curacoa (1878), HMS Cleopatra (1878) and HMS Conquest (1878), in which a high-pressure cylinder of 46 inches was flanked by two low-pressure cylinders of 64 inches. The engines produced about 2500 indicated horsepower. ==Triple-expansion vertical steam engines== Triple- expansion engines operating at up to 60 psi were fitted to HMS Dreadnought (1875), the high-pressure cylinders were 60-inch diameter and the low-pressure 90-inch diameter.The Engineer, 13 Oct 1876, p252 Triple-expansion engines were also fitted to the battleship HMS Victoria (1887), with cylinders of 43, 62 and 96 inches producing 12,000 ihp. Higher-pressure engines were fitted to the ironclads HMS Renown (1895), HMS Sans Pareil (1887), and HMS Trafalgar (1887).The Steam Engine, D.K. Clark, Half-Vol IV, Blackie & Son, 1892, pp679-686 Each ship had two engines, with each driving a 16.5-foot-diameter propellor. Each engine was rated at 6000 indicated horsepower at 95 rpm. Humphrys, Tennant and Co. also designed the boilers, each ship having a total of 8 boilers of 15-foot diameter with optional forced draft providing steam at 135 psi. HMS Blenheim (1890) was fitted with four triple-expansion engines giving her 20,000 indicated horsepower and a top speed of 22 knots. The forward engines could be disconnected to increase her range. Power plants were also provided for vessels built for the overseas market, such as the Shikishima which was completed in 1899, with its sea trials indicating 15,000 horsepower from her twin triple-expansion engines.\\"Official Trials of the Shikishima\\", The Engineer, 13 Oct 1899, p380 Other Fuji-class battleships also used engines and boilers supplied by Humphrys Tenant & Co. Triple-expansion engines of 11,200 i.h.p. were also provided to the Russian battleship Poltava (1894) and her sister ship the Petropavlovsk (1894). ==Horizontal triple- expansion steam engines for fast twin-screw cruisers== These horizontal triple-expansion steam engines were in pairs, with each pair rated at 6000 indicated horsepower. The details of these engines reported by D. K. ClarkThe Steam Engine, D.K. Clark, Half-Vol IV, Blackie & Son, 1892, pp686-691 do not reveal to which ships they were fitted. ==Four-cylinder triple-expansion engines== right A prestigious contract for Humphrys, Tennant and Co. was the power plant for the 1899 Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert (see image).The Engineer, 9 June 1899, p574 The two engines were capable of 7500 indicated horsepower continuously, and 11,000 indicated horsepower for short periods at a maximum of 140 rpm. The engines had high- and intermediate-pressure cylinders located between double low-pressure cylinders. The cylinder diameters were 26.5 in, 44.5 in and 2x53 in, all with a 39 in stroke. There was both steam and hand reversing gear operating via Stephenson link motion. The high- and intermediate-pressure cylinders used piston valves, whereas the low-pressure cylinders used slide valves. Each engine had twin condensers arranged so that either could be taken out of service for repair without stopping the engines, and each engine had two air pumps driven off the low- pressure connecting rods. Eighteen Belleville boilers provided steam at up to 300 psi, though this was dropped to 250 psi at the engines by reducing valves. This engine layout with triple expansion via four cylinders was clearly successful and was fitted into a range of ships, including the four Drake- class cruisers of 1901, which with 43 Belleville boilers produced 30,000 ihp and 23 knots. Four-cylinder triple-expansion engines were also fitted in HMS Carnarvon, built on the Clyde. In her trials in early 1905, she achieved a full-power run of 8 hours duration at 23.3 knots, a full knot above her design speed.\\"Speed Trials on the Clyde\\", The Engineer, 17 Mar 1905, p273 ==References *Chronology of the company.

His professional career was spent in the Philippines. Guirado represented the Philippines at international level, earning 36 caps in four years. ==Club career== Born in M√°laga, Andalusia, Guirado spent most of his senior career in Segunda Divisi√≥n B, playing for CD Don Benito, Burgos CF, UE Sant Andreu and UD Marbella. In late January 2012, he left Racing Lerme√±o in Tercera Divisi√≥n and moved to the Philippines, signing with Global FC. On 6 February he made his official debut for his new team, coming in as a substitute midway through the second half of an eventual 1‚Äì0 win against Green Archers United FC. On 26 February 2012, Guirado scored his first goal for Global in the United Football League, against Philippine Navy F.C. in a 5‚Äì0 victory. In late March, he agreed on a return to Lerme√±o for the following season. Guirado signed with fellow league club CD Burgos in July 2013, under the condition he would still be able to play international football. He retired from competitive football in 2016 at the age of 36, his last team being Ceres‚ÄìNegros F.C. in the United Football League. His last match was the 16-0 win against Pasargad F.C. on 11 June 2016, where he scored in the 77th minute; he cited family reasons for his decision, which he announced after the game. In July 2016, Guirado came out of retirement and signed for Spanish amateurs Real Burgos CF. ==International career== On 4 April 2011, it was reported that the Philippines national team was eying Guirado for the country's bid in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, but he was not able to suit up for the national squad because of prior commitments with Racing Lerme√±o. He only made his debut on 29 February 2012 in a friendly match against Malaysia, which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. On 19 March 2012, during the third place play-off of the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup, Guirado scored his first international goal to give the Philippines a 4‚Äì2 lead over Palestine, in an eventual 4‚Äì3 win. On 28 March 2016, he announced his retirement as player and team captain of the Azkals, stating that the 2018 World Cup qualifier against North Korea the next day would be his last match.

The building was designed to be the formal office and to stand detached from the main factory and warehouses, which opened onto Loch Street. Ogston & Tennant ceased trading in the 1970s, and the building is now used as offices. It is a category C listed building. ==The building== The architect credited with the design of 111 Gallowgate is Alexander Mavor who designed the soap- works for Ogston & Tennant. Alexander Mavor trained as a builder in London before moving to Scotland and joining William Henderson & Sons architectural practice. He became a partner there before leaving to start his own business. The building on the Gallowgate side has a low classical profile and is built from Kemnay granite. The main entrance has granite steps leading up to two Doric columns set either side of a recessed timbered door. The listing makes particular mention of the granite boundary wall topped with decorative metal railings. To the rear is the basement which is built from brick, not granite, and housed Ogston & Tennant's industrial laboratories. In 1941 the Loch Street side of the factory site was bombed. At some point in the 1970s Ogston and Tennant ceased trading and the building was then used as a Waldorf school. The interior of the building has been modernised to include serviced office and media space. ==Brief history of Ogston & Tennant == Ogston & Tennant Ltd. was formed in 1898 from two companies joining A. Ogston & Sons and Charles Tennant and Co. At the time of the merger Ogstons already owned both a factory and warehouses in Loch Street, Aberdeen. On 9 March 1910 the company won damages against the Glasgow Daily Record for defamation. This was in connection with another libel, by the Daily Mail against Lever Brothers. It totalled ¬£9,000 and the news was reported around the world. On 28 June 1910 they suffered a great fire which engulfed and destroyed the factory. Reports mention machinery crashing through the floors. Damage totalled ¬£80,000. In 1911 the company agreed to an \\"association\\" with Lever Brothers and after the second world war, they became part of the company until they ceased trading in the 1970s. ==References *The Soap Factory work space *Ingen-Ideas Ltd Category:Category C listed buildings in Aberdeen Category:Listed office buildings in the United Kingdom Category:Unilever Category:Office buildings in Scotland Category:1922 establishments in Scotland Category:British companies established in 1898 ","title":"The Soap Factory"},{"id":"35172465","text":"G√ºmeli is a forest belde (town) in Alaplƒ± district of Zonguldak Province, Turkey.

It is their third release in six years after Black Porch (Acoustic Sessions) and their second album since Twelve Year Silence. Originally due to be released in 2006 under the title of Hail Mary, the band faced troubles due to their contract with Warner, forcing them to shelve the album altogether. It wasn't until late 2011, where the band decided to get back together and release the material through their new record company, Goomba Music. ==History== Planning of the album Originally in December 2006, guitarist Clint Lowery stated that the band were \\"searching for producers right now to collaborate with\\" after working on new material on and off since their debut release and were to begin recording in January, 2007. Line up changes and band hiatus In January 2007, it was announced that Will Hunt was to tour as part of Vince Neil's solo band in Australia in March/April while in February Clint Lowery was recruited as a touring guitarist for Ko–Øn. The group stated that they were to continue on despite Clint's involvement with Ko–Øn, a move which they supported, and planned to enter the studio on March, 26. On May 17, 2007, it was announced that both McLawhorn and Hunt would temporarily join Evanescence as their touring guitarist and drummer, respectively. Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee stated that \\"We're just borrowing Will and Troy for awhile\\" and that they would not be leaving Dark New Day. There were growing rumours that the group were on the verge of splitting up due to Hunt and McLawhorn's involvement with Evanescence however guitarist Clint Lowery shot down these rumours stating: On June 25, a new song titled Hail Mary was posted on the groups Myspace. In September 2007, Clint posted on Dark New Day's MySpace page saying that the band returned to the studio to record their next album with producer Dave Bendeth. Mixing began in November and the album was completed by December with the band confirming some of the songs titles to appear on the album such as Simple, Hail Mary, Fiend, Outside and Vicious Thinking. In March 2008, the group posted one of the tracks set to appear on the new album on Myspace titled Goodbye however a few days later it was announced that Clint had rejoined previous band Sevendust although he still hoped the new album would be released soon. In April, drummer Hunt issued an update stating that Warner Bros. had decided to release the album however no release date was set. In May, guitarist Troy McLawhorn became the second member to leave the group. The group announced the addition of Switched guitarist B.C. Kochmit, who Hunt described as \\"the perfect combination of Troy and Clint\\", with frontman Brett Hestla also taking up guitar duties for the group. They also announced they would be releasing a series of Demo Tracks as downloadable \\"releases\\" in anticipation for their new album. Two songs from these were posted to the band's MySpace page, Fiend (Version 1) and I Don't Need You. On July 28, three new songs were added to their MySpace page, Anywhere, Simple and Vicious Thinking, as well as another version of Fiend, Goodbye and Hail Mary. They also announced a one-off show at the Three Bears Caf√© in Marietta, Georgia on September 6 where, during the show, guitarist Clint joined them on stage, after Sevendust's show was cancelled due to tropical storm Hannah. In February 2009, Clint Lowery issued an update for the band since \\"there hasn't been an official statement given\\" in sometime by the group stating it was unlikely that the album would be given an official release but that he would find out if there was a chance of the album being made available on iTunes. Despite this he stated that his update didn't clear much up and that the future of the group \\"doesn't look good\\". On September 1, 2011 via Twitter, after two years of silence, Dark New Day guitarist Clint Lowery posted \\"Cool, 2 new complete dnd records will be available on iTunes and other digital stores soon. Some real cool unreleased material. Stay tuned!.\\" This was followed by another message by Lowery a day later stating \\"FYI- Dark new day \\"hail Mary\\" and \\"B-sides\\" albums should be available next week on iTunes etc. if all goes well. Was a long time coming.\\" Dark New Day albums 'Hail Mary' and 'B-Sides' were released digitally on iTunes and Amazon MP3, but have since been removed. Signing with Goomba Music The music would eventually be revived when bassist Tim King from the band SoiL questioned Will Hunt why they only had one album out; with Hunt revealing the A & R man for the band had left, causing to shelve the album indefinitely. At King's suggestion, the band went through the seventy or so demos recorded and picked the songs for the album; however due to legal reasons, only some of the songs could be released as Warner still owned the rights to some of the earlier unreleased material.Guitar World Magazine, April 2012, pg.20 On January 6, 2012, the band announced their new record titled New Tradition would be released on February 28. The first single entitled \\"New Tradition\\" was sent to radio stations the same day. Clint Lowery posted the following statement; \\"We're very excited about the new DARK NEW DAY release. It seems the time is right to make these songs public and share with the fans that continue to support this project. We believe this music is still very valid and powerful today, and think its mandatory we give these songs a fair chance out in the music world. We owe it to ourselves and the DARK NEW DAY fans. 'New Tradition' sums up the mindset we were in writing the follow-up to 'Twelve Year Silence'.\\" Many of the tracks from 'New Tradition' were previously released on the 'B-Sides' and 'Hail Mary' albums. Brett Hestla said about the album: The band also provided a bonus track, \\"Rising Sun\\", to fans who purchased the album before March 6. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Dark New Day #\\"Fist From The Sky\\" ‚Äì 3:20 #\\"Come Alive\\" ‚Äì 4:14 #\\"I Don't Need You\\" ‚Äì 3:34 #\\"New Tradition\\" ‚Äì 2:50 #\\"Tremendous\\" ‚Äì 3:39 #\\"Sorry\\" ‚Äì 3:48 #\\"Straightjacket\\" ‚Äì 3:57 #\\"Take It From Me\\" ‚Äì 3:29 #\\"Caught In The Light\\" ‚Äì 4:03 #\\"Sunday\\" ‚Äì 4:06 #\\"Fiend\\" ‚Äì 3:38 #\\"Breakdown\\" ‚Äì 4:35 #\\"Burns Your Eyes\\" ‚Äì 3:31 * Alternate versions of tracks 10 & 11 were previously released on the Hail Mary album digitally released on September 2, 2011. * Tracks 1, 2,3,5,6,7, 8, & 16 were previously released on the B-Sides album digitally released on September 2, 2011. * Track 12 originally appeared as an acoustic track on the Black Porch Sessions EP. * Track 14 is a bonus track offered by the band as a special promotion during the week of the album's release. ==Personnel== * Brett Hestla - Lead Vocals, Guitar (guitar solo on \\"Sorry\\") * Clint Lowery - Lead Guitar, Vocals * Troy McLawhorn - Rhythm Guitar, Backing Vocals * Corey Lowery - Bass, Backing Vocals * Will Hunt - Drums, Backing Vocals ==References== Category:2012 albums Category:Dark New Day albums ","title":"New Tradition"},{"id":"35172569","text":"William Berra is an American painter of landscapes, figures, and still life. He is represented by galleries throughout the United States and his work is in many public and private collections. Berra has appeared in over 40 solo and group shows.Wissman, p.14. William Berra lives in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of Santa Fe with his wife, Alanna Burke, who is his business partner and a frequent model in his paintings. == Early life == In 1952, Berra was born in York, Pennsylvania. As a child he constantly sketched and painted. By adolescence he was copying the Neo-Classic painters and old masters, and he supplemented high school with classes at the York Academy of Art.Glenn, p. 98. Berra attended the Maryland Institute College of Art.Fauntleroy 2000, p. 90-91. == Career == Berra traveled throughout North America, capturing the landscape in studies painted en plein air. In 1976 Berra arrived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was dazzled by the landscape and the clarity of the high desert light, and stayed to paint it.Oakton, p. 31. His work was chosen for the 1978 Biennial Exhibition at the New Mexico Museum of Art. Jean Seth, owner of Seth's Canyon Road Art Gallery, saw the exhibition and offered him a show and representation. William Berra's career as a professional artist was born.Fauntleroy 2000, p. 91. Berra spent the 1980s primarily painting Northern New Mexico en plein air. He was influenced by the Macchiaioli painters of 19th century Italy, precursors to the French practitioners of Impressionism, and he experimented with techniques to achieve their effects. One technique was that of painting on a board shellacked with an orange base. The undercoating generally warms the painting, showing through where oil paint is applied sparingly. He also placed \\"complementary hues side by side for maximum visual vibration.\\"Eauclaire, p. 17. In the 1990s, Berra began to spend more time painting in the studio, developing material gathered in plein air sketches and photographs. He expanded his horizons and his subject matter, traveling and painting landscapes in Europe, Hawaii, and throughout North America.Boggs, p. 147. Italy became a favorite subject. In one project, Berra spent time in Rome seeking out views painted in the mid-19th century by a favorite artist, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and other plein air painters of Grand Tour subjects.Smith, p. 49. The paintings from this project were the subject of a solo exhibition in 2001. Berra also turned his attention increasingly to figurative work. Starting with oil sketches of his wife painted on location in Europe,Wissman, p. 15, 17. he developed a style that presents ambiguous figures in abstract, unresolved landscapes. He began an ongoing series of beach scenes that have become increasingly simplified and abstracted in recent years. His nude series presents a female figure either in intimate domestic settingsFauntleroy 2012, p. 34. or on utterly abstracted backgrounds.Editors of American Art Collector 2012, p. 150. Berra continues to paint landscapes of Europe, both city (Venice, Paris, London, etc.) and country (Tuscany, Provence, Santorini, Mykonos, etc.). He makes annual trips to the Hawaiian Islands, where dramatic scenery and weather inspire atmospheric landscape paintings.Kipp, p. 15. Northern New Mexico is also a subject. Throughout Berra's career, he has produced occasional still life paintings using the same approach that he uses in his figurative paintings: he simplifies the motif and presents it on an abstracted background. Many of his works, whatever the subject, use negative space to isolate the subject.Clawson, American Art Collector, p. 093. Berra also continues to develop his beach scenes and figurative paintings. He said this about a painting from his Diving Platform series: \\"I've been painting landscapes, beach scenes and figurative work for decades. Diving Platform, Dusk includes elements from them all: the reflective water, the evening sky, the figures. This painting represents a new phase in my figurative work.

His military and civil career spanned more than four decades, ending with the Bolshevik takeover of Georgia in 1921. He is also an author of military and historical reports, including an account of his 1874 reconnaissance mission to the then-Ottoman held Georgian lands with sketches of the region's medieval Christian monuments. ==Family== Kazbegi was born into the noble family of a Russian army officer in the village of Stepan-Tsminda in the mountainous Georgian province of Khevi, then part of the Tiflis Governorate, Russian Empire. He had two brothers‚ÄîDimitri and Gabriel‚Äîand the sister Elisabed. Gabriel was a Russian army colonel, while Dimitri (died 1880) and Elisabed organized a local school in Khevi. Their first-degree cousin, Alexander Kazbegi, was a noted Georgian prose writer. ·É†·Éê·Éõ·Éê·Éñ ·É°·É£·É†·Éõ·Éê·Éú·Éò·É´·Éî: ·Éó·Éî·É†·Éí·Éì·Éê·Éö·Éî·É£·Éö·Éò ·Éí·Éî·Éú·Éî·É†·Éê·Éö·Éò. Literaturuli Sakartvelo. 2002-07-05. Electronic Archive of Georgian Press. Accessed March 22, 2012. Giorgi Kazbegi was married to Elisabed (died 1919), daughter of Prince Alexander Maghalashvili. They had four children: Elene, Niko, Constantine and Alexander. He outlived his wife and all three of his sons. Alexander, a Russian army colonel during World War I, was killed at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1914. Constantine, a military engineer, was murdered in St. Petersburg in 1915. Niko, a Russian cavalry rotamaster, died in the Carpathian Mountains in 1917. ==Early career== Giorgi Kazbegi graduated from the General Staff Academy St.Petersburg in 1870 and was dispatched, in the rank of major, to the Caucasian Grenadiers Division. During his service in the Caucasus, he befriended the leading Georgian intellectuals of that time. In 1873 he accompanied the popular Georgian poet Akaki Tsereteli in his journey to the mountainous western Georgian provinces of Racha and Lechkhumi. In the meantime, he progressed through military ranks, becoming lieutenant-colonel in 1874. –ì–æ–≥–∏—Ç–∏–¥–∑–µ –ú.–î. –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ç 1699-1921: 96. –ö–∏–µ–≤, 2001 ==Turkish war== The Skhalta cathedral. A drawing from Dimitri Bakradze's book (1878) is copied from Kazbegi's travelogue of \\"Turkish Georgia\\". In 1874, Kazbegi spent three months on a reconnaissance mission to the historical southwestern Georgian districts around Batum, which were under the sway of the Ottoman Empire at that time. He left a valuable account of his travels to these hitherto little explored lands, accompanied by sketches of medieval Georgian churches and monasteries. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), Kazbegi served in the special Kobuleti detachment, receiving a concussion at the action of Achkvistavi. For his conduct, Kazbegi was promoted to colonel. He was then, successively, in command of the 153rd Derbent Infantry Regiment (1878‚Äì1879) and the 79th Kurin Infantry Regiment (1879‚Äì1882). Retired to reserves in 1882, he spent the next three years traveling in Europe and America. In 1885 he returned to active service, being attached to the Caucasian staff. He was appointed Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Fortress and promoted to major-general on October 29, 1892. ==Later career== Kazbegi then served as a Quartermaster general of the Warsaw Military District from March 27, 1897 to July 3, 1899 and a commandant of the Ivangorod Fortress from July 3, 1899 to June 23, 1902. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on January 1, 1901 and served as a commandant of Warsaw Fortress from June 23, 1902 until January 25, 1905, when he was placed in charge of the Vladivostok Fortress. He served in this capacity during the Russian Revolution of 1905. Kazbegi responded to a revolutionary upheaval in Vladivostok with a combination of diplomacy and force. He did not immediately disperse the demonstrating crowds, persuaded rebellious garrison troops to return to their barracks and then called in Ussuri Cossack detachments to restore order.Stephan, John J. (1996), The Russian Far East: A History, p. 102. Stanford University Press, . On March 7, 1906, he was dismissed from the active military service for his lenient treatment of the mutineers. The American socialist activist William English Walling reports an incident in which General Kazbegi was confronted by the Russian tsar Nicholas II: ==Last years== Remaining at disposal of Commander- in-Chief of the Far East, Kazbegi was attached to the Russian Chief of Staff until September 25, 1907, when he received the rank of general of infantry and was allowed to retire with a pension and a privilege of wearing a uniform. Kazbegi then returned to his native Georgia, where he was elected, from 1908 to 1918, a chairman of the Society for the Spreading of Literacy Among Georgians, a leading Georgian cultural institution of that time. During the years of Georgia's short-lived independence from 1918 to 1921, Kazbegi was an Honorary President of that Society. The Soviet Russian invasion in 1921 forced the seasoned general into exile to Constantinople, where he died in obscurity the same year. ==Awards== Among the awards Kazbegi received during his 47 years of military service were: a Gold Sword for Bravery (1877) and Order of St. Anna, 3rd Class (1877) and 1st Class (1899), Order of Saint Stanislaus, 3rd Class (1897) and 1st Class (1895). He was also awarded an Order of the Crown of Romania in 1899. ==Works== * –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥—Ä–µ–Ω–∞–¥–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ï.–ò.–í. –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ö–Ω—è–∑—è –ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∫–∞, –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã. ‚Äî –¢–∏—Ñ–ª–∏—Å, 1865. * –ö—É—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü—ã –≤ –ß–µ—á–Ω–µ –∏ –î–∞–≥–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ. 1834-1861 –≥. –û—á–µ—Ä–∫ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ 79 –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ö—É—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ï–≥–æ –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –í—ã—Å–æ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ö–Ω—è–∑—è –ü–∞–≤–ª–∞ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∫–∞. ‚Äî –¢–∏—Ñ–ª–∏—Å, 1885. * –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –¢–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏. –ß. 1-2. ‚Äî –¢–∏—Ñ–ª–∏—Å, 1888. * –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –õ–∞–∑–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–∞–Ω–¥–∂–∞–∫–∞. ‚Äî –¢–∏—Ñ–ª–∏—Å, 1902. * –°–ª—É–∂–±–∞ –≤–æ–π—Å–∫ –ø—Ä–∏ –∞—Ç–∞–∫–µ –∏ –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–µ –∫—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π. ‚Äî –í–∞—Ä—à–∞–≤–∞, 1900 (2-–µ –∏–∑–¥., 1902). ==ReferencesBibliography== * –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤ –°. –í. –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏. –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–æ–≤ –∏ –∞–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª–æ–≤ –æ—Ç –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ I –¥–æ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è II. –¢–æ–º I. –ê ‚Äî –ö. ‚Äî –ú., 2009. ‚Äî –°. 5997. ‚Äî * –°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∞–º –ø–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤—É. –°–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω –ø–æ 1 –º–∞—è 1893 –≥–æ–¥–∞. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1893. ‚Äî –°. 873. –¢–æ –∂–µ. –°–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω –ø–æ 4 –∏—é–ª—è 1907 –≥–æ–¥–∞. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1907. ‚Äî –°. 130. * –ì–ª–∏–Ω–æ–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π –ù. –ü. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∏ –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —à—Ç–∞–±–∞. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1882. ‚Äî –ü—Ä–∏–ª., —Å. 158. * –°—Ç–∞—Ä—á–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –ê. –ê. –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã 1877 ‚Äî 1878 –≥–≥. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1878. ‚Äî –°. 140.

He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1847. During the same year, he was appointed on the U.S. Geological Survey of the Lake Superior region, under Josiah D. Whitney and Charles T. Jackson. Subsequently, he went to Europe and studied chemistry at Berlin, at G√∂ttingen, where in 1852 he received the degree of doctor of philosophy, and at the Sorbonne in Paris. After his return to the United States, he was soon called to the chair of chemistry in Union College, and held it until 1857, when he was elected to a similar professorship at Columbia University, remaining there until 1877. Failing health, the result of a sunstroke that he received at the World's fair in Philadelphia during 1876, compelled his retirement, and for several years he resided in Germany. Joy was a member of the juries of the international world's fairs of London, Paris, Vienna, and Philadelphia, and also a member of scientific societies. In 1866 he was elected president of the Lyceum of Natural History (now New York Academy of Sciences). He was also president of the American Photographic Society, chairman of the Polytechnic Association of the American Institute, and foreign secretary of the American Geographical Society. He died in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on 29 May 1891. ==Research and publications== His original research began in G√∂ttingen with investigations on the combination of alcohol radicles with selenium, in which field he was one of the earliest workers. Later he examined the compounds of glucinum, and published an account of his investigations in the American Journal of Science. He also made numerous analyses of minerals and meteorites. Of the former, many were contributed to Dana's Mineralogy. Joy was a frequent contributor of popular articles on scientific subjects to various journals, and had held the editorship of Scientific American, and later of the Journal of Applied Chemistry. He also wrote chemical articles for the American Cyclop√¶dia. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * Category:1823 births Category:1891 deaths Category:American chemists Category:University of G√∂ttingen alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Columbia University faculty Category:Union College (New York) faculty ","title":"Charles A.

Like ubiquitin, it serves to direct proteins to the proteasome for degradation. However, the enzymology of ubiquitylation and pupylation is different, owing to their distinct evolutionary origins. In contrast to the three-step reaction of ubiquitylation, pupylation requires only two steps, and thus only two enzymes are involved in pupylation. The enzymes involved in pupylation are descended from glutamine synthetase. Similar to ubiquitin, Pup is attached to specific lysine residues of substrate proteins by isopeptide bonds; this is called pupylation. It is then recognized by the protein Mycobacterium proteasomal ATPase (Mpa), in a mechanism that induces folding of Pup. Mpa delivers the substrate protein to the proteasome for degradation by coupling of ATP hydrolysis. The discovery of Pup indicates that like eukaryotes, bacteria may use a small-protein modifier to control protein stability. The Pup gene encodes a 64‚Äìamino acid protein with a molecular size of 6.944 kDa: Pup is an intrinsically disordered protein. In 2010, scientists at the Brookhaven National Laboratory determined the X-ray crystal structure of the complex between Pup and its delivery enzyme Mpa and found that Pup binding to Mpa induces the folding of a unique alpha-helix. In 2017, the presence of Pup homologs in bacterial species outside of the group of gram-positive bacteria was reported. The Pup homologs were termed UBact (for Ubiquitin Bacterial), although the distinction has not been proven to be phylogenetically supported by a separate evolutionary origin and is without experimental evidence. UBact is a homolog of Pup, and is found in several phyla of gram-negative bacteria (Pup is found predominantly in the gram-positive bacterial phylum Actinobacteria). Below is the UBact sequence in the bacterium Methylacidiphilum infernorum: == See also == *Ubiquitin *SUMO protein *Ubiquitin bacterial (UBact) == References  External links == * PupDB, a database of pupylated proteins and pupylation sites.

It lived during the Middle Triassic, and its fossils have been found in Europe. ==History== Fossils of Encrinus went by several names in Germany before the establishment of modern paleontology. In Lower Saxony, they were called Sonnenr√§der (\\"sun wheels\\"), while in Thuringia and Hesse they were called Bonifatiuspfennige (\\"Saint Boniface's pennies\\"). In southwestern Germany, they went by Hexengeld (\\"witches' money\\"). The animal was correctly reconstructed for the first time in 1729, although various parts of the animal had been described before that. Encrinus was described in 1764. It was assigned to the order Encrinida by Jack Sepkoski in 2002. ==Description== E. liliiformis with parts labeled, based on Encrinus possessed a large cup- or crown-like structure at the top of its body, which has been described as resembling \\"an unopened tulip.\\" This \\"cup\\" could be between and long. The structure displayed \\"five-fold symmetry\\" and had a slightly concave base. It bore ten arms (although in some species, such as E. carnallis, it bore 20), which in turn bore many small branches (pinnules). When opened, the arms and pinnules formed a kind of \\"feeding fan\\", used to catch prey such as plankton. \\"Microscopic interpinnular channels\\" suggest that Encrinus may have been an active filter feeder, creating its own currents by beating its cilia. It is known that the arms could shut tightly in life (most Encrinus fossils are found in this position), but it is difficult to estimate the greatest angle at which they could open. It is possible that specimens recorded as being widest open demonstrate the normal angle of opening in life. A tegmen (\\"small leathery dome\\") covered the mouth and topped the cup. Any particles of food that the animal caught would be passed down the arms and below the tegmen via grooves, eventually leading to cilia, which in turn led to the mouth. When viewed from above, the stem was circular in shape. Large and small ossicles covered the stem, creating a pattern of frequent small ossicles sandwiched between the large ones. The stem did not possess any cirri, and may have been held in place by roots of some sort. The breakage of the stem during the animal's life was a common occurrence, and it often survived long enough to form a new end on its shortened stem. Being from the Middle Triassic, Encrinus is the last known from its group of crinoids, as most others died out during the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event. ==See also== * ==References * Category:Prehistoric crinoid genera Category:Triassic crinoids Category:Extinct animals of Europe Category:Middle Triassic animals of Europe ","title":"Encrinus"},{"id":"35173088","text":"Gustav \\"Gustl\\" M√ºller (23 October 1903 ‚Äì 20 September 1989) was a German Nordic combined and cross-country skier.

In 1958 he was appointed professor of meteorology and associate director of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He was a pioneer in cloud physics and radar meteorology. Dr. Battan immigrated to the United States with his parents, Anibale and Louise Battan, from northern Italy, a region known as Trentino- Alto Adige. == Career == Along with his colleague and close friend, Dr. David Atlas, Dr. Battan underwent rigorous training in radar engineering and meteorology in the U.S. Army Air Corps, at Harvard University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) during World War II. He received his B.S. from New York University (NYU) in 1946 and then moved to the University of Chicago where he obtained his M.S. and a Ph.D. in 1953. During the Thunderstorm Project (1946‚Äì48), Dr. Battan used radar analysis to show precipitation initiation from coalescence in midlatitude convective clouds. He, along with Dr. Roscoe Braham Jr. and Dr. Horace R. Byers, conducted one of the first randomized experiments on cloud modification by the artificial nucleation of cumulus clouds. After obtaining his Ph.D., he remained at Chicago until 1958. Then he became a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences and Institute for Atmospheric Physics, University of Arizona, and served as its director from 1973 to 1982. There he conducted research on clouds, precipitation processes, lightning, and radar relationships. He led the development of the first 3-cm Doppler weather radar to measure vertical motion and particle sizes in thunderstorms in 1964. He was the American Meteorological Society (AMS) president from 1966 to 1967 and served on numerous national and international committees including the U.S. President's National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere in 1978. He was instrumental in the founding of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). He received many awards including the AMS Meisinger Award in 1962 and the AMS Half Century Award in 1975. == The Louis J. Battan Author's Award == Dr. Battan was a prolific writer whose repertoire includes one of the first textbooks on radar meteorology in 1959 and Radar Observation of the Atmosphere in 1973, which became the reference text on the subject. He authored 16 books and more than 100 articles. His contribution to meteorological education, through publications written in an accessible and informative style, has been honored by the AMS with the establishment of two annual \\"Louis J. Battan Author's Awards\\". Recipients of the Louis J. Battan Author's Award (Adult) include: James Rodger Fleming, Professor of Science, Technology, and Society, Colby College, Waterville, Maine (2012); Chris Mooney, Contributing Editor, Science Progress & Author, Washington, DC (2009); Kerry Emanuel (2007); Charles Wohlforth (2006); John M.

Category:2011 singles ==Composition== Musically, \\"Nuclear Seasons\\" is a slow-burning dark wave, synth-pop, electropop and lo-fi song with low-lying synths, industrial textures, and a shadowy atmosphere. The album version of the song contains a minute-long intro (a sample of \\"Grins\\", another song appearing on True Romance) where Charli repeats the refrain \\"I want this forever.\\" According to Peter Tabakis of Pretty Much Amazing, the song \\"forms the sonic and thematic outline for each song to come.\\" The song's 80's-influenced vocal melody has been described as the centerpiece of its \\"lavish, if busy, production\\", which features flourishes of synths rings, electronic buzzes, and pattering and crashing beats. Lyrically, \\"Nuclear Seasons\\" compares taking shelter from the \\"literal and figurative fallout of a breakup\\" to surviving a nuclear fallout. Its lyrics speak of things such as burning cars and falling through the clouds, which according to Art Ivan of Tiny Mix Tapes, depicts what a rapture would look and sound like. In an interview with Rolling Stone XCX stated the song \\"reflects a state of cultural decay.\\" Charli specifically notes what she sees as a decay in youth culture, stating \\"I don't feel like there's anything for people to really grab onto these days. There's no movement to speak of.\\" While reviewing True Romance, Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine called the song a \\"K-pop-esque opus\\" which showed one of only a few moments of genuine spontaneity. ==Critical reception== Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a positive review, saying: \\"It makes you wonder why Charli XCX isn't all over commercial radio; it's a catchy, well-constructed pop song that manages to pack a lot in without conforming to the Guetta/Harris dance-pop template, instead injecting an effortless, swaggering cool.\\" ==Music video and usage in media== The video for \\"Nuclear Seasons\\" was uploaded to her channel on YouTube on 22 November 2011. The video has a witch house vibe, and was directed by Ryan Evans, with effects by Crim3s. \\"Nuclear Seasons\\" was Charli's first official video, not including the Salem remix video for \\"Stay Away\\". The song is featured on a sneak peek for the Swim 2013 collection for Victoria's Secret and was featured on a season six episode of Gossip Girl. http://vsallaccess.victoriassecret.com/2012/12/27/victorias-secret- swim-2013-sneak-peek/http://www.cwtv.com/music/gossip- girl/season-6/episode-610 The song is featured in the opening credits for the film, Two Night Stand starring Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton.

He was the son of Henry Horace Gorrell, an opera singer and voice teacher, and Mercedes Beatrice Leese. == Correspondent == Gorrell was a reporter for the Kansas City Journal- Post in 1929, before joining United Press in 1930, working with Richard D. McMillan. He was assigned to the Rome bureau in the mid 1930s, but was expelled from the country in 1936 due to his reporting. Gorrell was part of the United Press staff in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, where he was acquainted with Ernest Hemingway. In 1936, he was captured by an \\"Italian tank crew and deported, by way of several jails\\" to France. Gorrell was the chief reporter with American troops for United Press as the United States entered the war. For his actions during an air mission in 1942, he became the first correspondent to be decorated in the Middle East during World War II and only the second correspondent to be decorated during the entire war. He was awarded the Air Medal for gallantry by order of President Roosevelt. He also filed the first report on the invasion of Normandy in 1944. On August 26, 1944, he was among the first, along with Ernie Pyle, to enter the city after the liberation of Paris. Gorrell followed the British army to North Africa and Palestine and finally he covered a very obscure aspect of World War II, the revolt of Iraq. In his memoir, he mentions some personal statements of some local British commanders who accepted that their stronghold in Habaniya was surrounded by thousands of armed Arabs aided by some German planes without a hope to stand. Another curious detail is that Iran also was threatened in a similar way but was occupied by Russian and British forces obviously in full co-operation. Henry Gorrell was there reporting in detail for the United Press. After the war, he left United Press to establish and edit the Veterans' Report from 1946 until his death.

WWA was founded in 1979 by a group of wilderness advocates and outdoors people who envisioned the first Wyoming Wilderness Act. In 1984, the passage of the Wyoming Wilderness Act brought to all Americans the permanent protection of an additional 1.1 million acres of ecologically diverse, wild country in Wyoming. WWA was instrumental in passing the act by educating and train activists on a grassroots level. In 2003, WWA was reborn with a new opportunity to protect additional wild watersheds, intact ecosystems, old- growth forests, important wildlife habitat, and wildlife migration corridors ‚Äì wild landscapes that truly deserve lasting protection as wilderness. As of 2012, the organization has over 700 members with offices in Sheridan, Buffalo, Lander, Dubois, and Jackson Wyoming. Currently, the whole wilderness system in Wyoming is roughly three million acres. Five million acres of spectacular wild land still remain unprotected and vulnerable to development. Not one acre of new wilderness has been protected in Wyoming since 1984! On February 10, 2012, The Wyoming Wilderness Association celebrated its 10th anniversary advocating for more wilderness in Wyoming.http://www.wildwyo.org ==Campaigns== Although the Wyoming Wilderness Association is involved in campaigns to designate new wilderness in Wyoming, not all public lands in Wyoming are undeveloped and have wilderness potential. From agency recommendations and citizens' proposals, WWA has prioritized the \\"gem\\" roadless areas that are left over after large-scale industrial development from oil gas and mineral extraction. These campaigns below represent the current efforts and direction of the organization. Rock Creek recommended wilderness The Rock Creek recommended wilderness area was recommended for wilderness in the 2005 Bighorn National Forest Management Plan. WWA has garnered over 500 business and 1400 individual letters of support in favor of Rock Creek as congressionally designated wilderness. Granite rock formation in the Rock Creek recommended wilderness area Shoshone National Forest Currently the Shoshone National Forest (SNF) is revising its management plan, which will determine the management direction of the forest for the next 10‚Äì20 years. The SNF is home to prized wildlife habitat and vast tracts of roadless land in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Although 34 roadless areas have been inventoried by the forest service, very few have been recommended for wilderness and most are under attack to be released from roadless protection. This forest is surrounded by some of the largest oil and gas fields in Wyoming and pressure is mounting to drill on the forest. Currently, off-road vehicles and all- terrain vehicles are increasing efforts to open roadless areas to road development and motorized trails. WWA is seeking more agency cooperation and consideration of public comment supporting roadless. Bridger-Teton National Forest In the past, WWA has been very active in the Bridger-Teton region. Educational efforts culminated in the publication of \\"Living in Wild Country\\", which is a user-friendly guide to help people understand the value of Wyoming's extraordinary wild landscapes and what they can do to help keep them wild. Efforts are ramping up to educate the public on a massive fuels reduction plan for fire mitigation that would compromise wilderness characteristics in the Palisades Wilderness Study Area. BLM Wyoming is home to over 18 million acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands which consist of some of the best wildlife habitat, hunting and fishing; however not one acre of BLM land has been designated as wilderness. After large-scale fossil fuel extraction across the state, only a small fraction of roadless land and Wilderness Study Areas remains undeveloped and even these areas are under the threat. WWA is currently involved in Resource Management Plan (RMP) revisions across Wyoming, which guide the BLM's management policies for the next 15‚Äì20 years, and is continually seeking more public comment to the BLM regarding preservation of wilderness resources and advocacy for more recommended wilderness areas. WWA has also created an on-line guide to help the public better understand the RMP process and how citizens can advocate for protection of more BLM lands in Wyoming. ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1979 Category:Environmental organizations based in Wyoming ","title":"Wyoming Wilderness Association"},{"id":"35173299","text":"Sanjagan (, also Romanized as SanjagƒÅn, SanjegƒÅn, SanjgƒÅn, SenjegƒÅn, SenjgƒÅn, and Sƒ´njgƒÅn) is a village in Rahjerd-e Sharqi Rural District, Salafchegan District, Qom County, Qom Province, Iran.

The new squadron was equipped with Fairey IIIFs and served in the Mediterranean. Following a ship refit the squadron split its aircraft between HMS Courageous and Glorious when they sailed to the Mediterranean in August 1935 in response to the Abyssinian crisis. The squadron, now re-equipped with Fairey Swordfish, was transferred to Admiralty control in 1940. World War II In the early part of the war the squadron sailed aboard HMS Glorious into the Red Sea and Indian Ocean to attack enemy shipping, returning to the Mediterranean in Jan 1940. They operated from Hal Far, Malta until March 1940, until they were needed to take part in the defence of Norway. There HMS Glorious was sunk by the German battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst on 8 June 1940, and half of the squadron (5 aircraft) lost. The remainder flew from RNAS Hatston with 821 Squadron on 21 June 1940 to attack Scharnhorst, with little or no success. On 24 July 1940 they attacked enemy destroyers and shipping off Norway but were disbanded at Hatston in December 1940. In November 1941 the squadron was reformed at Crail airfield in Fife, Scotland as a torpedo bomber reconnaissance (TBR) Swordfish squadron, subsequently sailing on HMS Furious in August 1942 with 9 Albacores for convoy duties. In September 1942 the squadron was attached to No 16 Group, Coastal Command at RAF Manston and RAF Tangmere for anti-submarine patrols in the English Channel. In June 1943 the squadron was re-equipped with Fairey Barracuda IIs at Lee-on-Solent and joined the 11th TBR Wing in southern India. They were finally disbanded in July 1944 at Katukurunda Airport after being merged with 822 squadron. ==Aircraft operated== Fairey IIIF { +Aircraft operated by 823 Naval Air Squadron ! From !! To !!

(1963). ‚ÄúGeostrophic Motion.‚Äù Reviews of Geophysics Volume 1, No. 2., p. 123. quasi-geostrophic (QG) motion refers to flows where the Coriolis force and pressure gradient forces are almost in balance, but with inertia also having an effect. Kundu, P.K. and Cohen, I.M. (2008). Fluid Mechanics, 4th edition. Elsevier., p. 658. ==Origin== Atmospheric and oceanographic flows take place over horizontal length scales which are very large compared to their vertical length scale, and so they can be described using the shallow water equations. The Rossby number is a dimensionless number which characterises the strength of inertia compared to the strength of the Coriolis force. The quasi-geostrophic equations are approximations to the shallow water equations in the limit of small Rossby number, so that inertial forces are an order of magnitude smaller than the Coriolis and pressure forces. If the Rossby number is equal to zero then we recover geostrophic flow. The quasi-geostrophic equations were first formulated by Jule Charney. == Derivation of the single-layer QG equations == In Cartesian coordinates, the components of the geostrophic wind are : {f_0} {v_g} = {\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial x} (1a) : {f_0} {u_g} = - {\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial y} (1b) where {\\\\Phi} is the geopotential. The geostrophic vorticity : {\\\\zeta_g} = {\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\cdot abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V_g}} can therefore be expressed in terms of the geopotential as : {\\\\zeta_g} = {{\\\\partial v_g \\\\over \\\\partial x} - {\\\\partial u_g \\\\over \\\\partial y} = {1 \\\\over f_0} \\\\left({ {\\\\partial^2 \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial x^2} + {\\\\partial^2 \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial y^2}}\\\\right) = {1 \\\\over f_0}{ abla^2 \\\\Phi}} (2) Equation (2) can be used to find {\\\\zeta_g (x,y)} from a known field {\\\\Phi (x,y)}. Alternatively, it can also be used to determine {\\\\Phi} from a known distribution of {\\\\zeta_g} by inverting the Laplacian operator. The quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation can be obtained from the {x} and {y} components of the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation which can then be derived from the horizontal momentum equation : {D\\\\mathbf{V} \\\\over Dt} + f \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V} = - abla \\\\Phi (3) The material derivative in (3) is defined by : {{D \\\\over Dt} = {\\\\left({\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t}\\\\right)_p} + {\\\\left({\\\\mathbf{V} \\\\cdot abla}\\\\right)_p} + {\\\\omega {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}}} (4) :where {\\\\omega = {Dp \\\\over Dt}} is the pressure change following the motion. The horizontal velocity {\\\\mathbf{V}} can be separated into a geostrophic {\\\\mathbf{V_g}} and an ageostrophic {\\\\mathbf{V_a}} part : {\\\\mathbf{V} = \\\\mathbf{V_g} + \\\\mathbf{V_a}} (5) Two important assumptions of the quasi-geostrophic approximation are :: 1. {\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\gg \\\\mathbf{V_a} }, or, more precisely {{\\\\mathbf{V_a} \\\\over \\\\mathbf{V_g}}} \\\\sim O(\\\\text{Rossby number}). :: 2. the beta-plane approximation {f = f_0 + \\\\beta y} with {\\\\frac{\\\\beta y}{f_0} \\\\sim O(\\\\text{Rossby number})} The second assumption justifies letting the Coriolis parameter have a constant value {f_0} in the geostrophic approximation and approximating its variation in the Coriolis force term by {f_0 + \\\\beta y}.Holton, J.R. (2004). Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology, 4th Edition. Elsevier., p. 149. However, because the acceleration following the motion, which is given in (1) as the difference between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, depends on the departure of the actual wind from the geostrophic wind, it is not permissible to simply replace the velocity by its geostrophic velocity in the Coriolis term. The acceleration in (3) can then be rewritten as : {f \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V} + abla \\\\Phi} = {(f_0 + \\\\beta y)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{V_g} + \\\\mathbf{V_a}) - f_0 \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V_g}} = {f_0 \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V_a} + \\\\beta y \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V_g} } (6) The approximate horizontal momentum equation thus has the form : {D_g \\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\over Dt} = {-f_0 \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V_a} - \\\\beta y \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V_g}} (7) Expressing equation (7) in terms of its components, : {{D_g u_g \\\\over Dt} - {f_0 v_a} - {\\\\beta y v_g} = 0} (8a) : {{D_g v_g \\\\over Dt} + {f_0 u_a} + {\\\\beta y u_g} = 0} (8b) Taking {{\\\\partial (8b) \\\\over \\\\partial x} - {\\\\partial (8a) \\\\over \\\\partial y}}, and noting that geostrophic wind is nondivergent (i.e., { abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{V} = 0}), the vorticity equation is : {{D_g \\\\zeta_g \\\\over Dt} = f_0 \\\\left ({{\\\\partial u_a \\\\over \\\\partial x}+{\\\\partial v_a \\\\over \\\\partial y}} \\\\right) - \\\\beta v_g } (9) Because {f} depends only on {y} (i.e., {{D_g f \\\\over Dt} = \\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla f = \\\\beta v_g}) and that the divergence of the ageostrophic wind can be written in terms of {\\\\omega} based on the continuity equation : {{\\\\partial u_a \\\\over \\\\partial x}+{\\\\partial v_a \\\\over \\\\partial y}+{\\\\partial \\\\omega \\\\over \\\\partial p}=0} equation (9) can therefore be written as : {{\\\\partial \\\\zeta_g \\\\over \\\\partial t} = {-\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla ({\\\\zeta_g + f})} - {f_0 {\\\\partial \\\\omega \\\\over \\\\partial p}} } (10) The same identity using the geopotential Defining the geopotential tendency {\\\\chi = {\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial t}} and noting that partial differentiation may be reversed, equation (10) can be rewritten in terms of {\\\\chi} as : {{1 \\\\over f_0}{ abla^2 \\\\chi} = {-\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla \\\\left({{1 \\\\over f_0}{ abla^2 \\\\chi} + f} \\\\right)} + {f_0 {\\\\partial \\\\omega \\\\over \\\\partial p}}} (11) The right-hand side of equation (11) depends on variables {\\\\chi} and {\\\\omega}. An analogous equation dependent on these two variables can be derived from the thermodynamic energy equation : {{{ \\\\left ({{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} + {\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla}} \\\\right) \\\\left({-\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p} \\\\right)}-\\\\sigma \\\\omega}={kJ \\\\over p}} (12) where {\\\\sigma = {-R T_0 \\\\over p}{d \\\\log \\\\Theta_0 \\\\over dp}} and {\\\\Theta_0} is the potential temperature corresponding to the basic state temperature. In the midtroposphere, {\\\\Theta_0} ‚âà {2.5 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\mathrm{m}{^2}\\\\mathrm{Pa}^{-2}\\\\mathrm{s}^{-2}}. Multiplying (12) by {f_0 \\\\over \\\\sigma} and differentiating with respect to {p} and using the definition of {\\\\chi} yields : {{{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p} \\\\left ({{f_0 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\chi \\\\over \\\\partial p}} \\\\right )}=-{{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}\\\\left({{f_0 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla}{\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p}}\\\\right)}-{{f_0}{\\\\partial \\\\omega \\\\over \\\\partial p}}-{{f_0}{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}\\\\left({kJ \\\\over \\\\sigma p}\\\\right)}} (13) If for simplicity {J} were set to 0, eliminating {\\\\omega} in equations (11) and (13) yields Holton, J.R. (2004). Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology, 4th Edition. Elsevier., p. 157. : {{ \\\\left({ abla^2 + {{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p} \\\\left({{f_0^2 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}}\\\\right)}}\\\\right){\\\\chi}}=-{{f_0}{\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla}\\\\left({{{1 \\\\over f_0}{ abla^2 \\\\Phi}}+f}\\\\right)}-{{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}\\\\left({{-}{f_0^2 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla}\\\\left({\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p}\\\\right)}\\\\right)}} (14) Equation (14) is often referred to as the geopotential tendency equation. It relates the local geopotential tendency (term A) to the vorticity advection distribution (term B) and thickness advection (term C). The same identity using the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity Using the chain rule of differentiation, term C can be written as : {-{{\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla}{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}\\\\left({{f_0^2 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p}}\\\\right)}-{{f_0^2 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\over \\\\partial p}{\\\\cdot abla}{\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p}}} (15) But based on the thermal wind relation, : {{f_0{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\over \\\\partial p}}={\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\times abla \\\\left({\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p} \\\\right)}}. In other words,{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\over \\\\partial p} is perpendicular to { abla ({\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p})} and the second term in equation (15) disappears. The first term can be combined with term B in equation (14) which, upon division by {f_0} can be expressed in the form of a conservation equation Holton, J.R. (2004). Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology, 4th Edition. Elsevier., p. 160. : {{\\\\left({{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t}+{\\\\mathbf{V_g} \\\\cdot abla}}\\\\right)q}={D_g q \\\\over Dt}=0} (16) where {q} is the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity defined by : {q = {{{1 \\\\over f_0}{ abla^2 \\\\Phi}}+{f}+{{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial p}\\\\left({{f_0 \\\\over \\\\sigma}{\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial p}}\\\\right)}}} (17) The three terms of equation (17) are, from left to right, the geostrophic relative vorticity, the planetary vorticity and the stretching vorticity. == Implications == As an air parcel moves about in the atmosphere, its relative, planetary and stretching vorticities may change but equation (17) shows that the sum of the three must be conserved following the geostrophic motion. Equation (17) can be used to find {q} from a known field {\\\\Phi}. Alternatively, it can also be used to predict the evolution of the geopotential field given an initial distribution of {\\\\Phi} and suitable boundary conditions by using an inversion process. More importantly, the quasi-geostrophic system reduces the five-variable primitive equations to a one-equation system where all variables such as {u_g}, {v_g} and {T} can be obtained from {q} or height {\\\\Phi}. Also, because {\\\\zeta_g} and {\\\\mathbf{V_g}} are both defined in terms of {\\\\Phi(x,y,p,t)}, the vorticity equation can be used to diagnose vertical motion provided that the fields of both {\\\\Phi} and {\\\\partial \\\\Phi \\\\over \\\\partial t} are known. == References == Category:Fluid mechanics Category:Synoptic meteorology and weather ","title":"Quasi-geostrophic equations"},{"id":"35173384","text":"Jereem Richards (born 13 January 1994) is a Trinidadian track and field sprinter who specializes in the 200 metres and 400 metres events. Richards is from Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago, and attends the University of Alabama. He was part of the Trinidad and Tobago team that won the bronze medal in the 4√ó400 m relay at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, and the gold medal in the 4 x 400m relay at the 2017 IAAF World Championships. ==Career== Richards' first major competition was the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships. There, he ran the third leg of Trinidad and Tobago's 4x400m relay squad, which won the bronze medal. 2017 became a breakout season for Richards; he opened his season with a wind-assisted 19.98, and 16 days later he ran his first legal sub-20 with 19.97 seconds, lowering his personal best by over half a second. He won the national 200, title in 20.15 seconds, allowing him to compete at the IAAF World Championships in London later that year. He also improved his 400m personal best by 7/10ths of a second with 45.27. Richards made his outdoor world championship debut at the IAAF World Championships in London. Competing in the 200m, he ran the fastest time in the heats of 20.05, and the next day he won his semi-final in 20.14 seconds. He then went on to win the bronze medal in the final; Ramil Guliyev of Turkey won gold in 20.09 seconds, while Wayde Van Niekerk of South Africa beat Richards to the silver medal by exactly 1/1000 of a second. Van Niekerk clocked 20.106, while Richards clocked 20.107. Richards stated that his race had been undermined when he slipped coming out of his blocks. \\"I tried my best not to let it affect me too much,\\" he said. \\"At the turn I wasn't in contention really, so to get a medal from there is a great achievement.\\" Three days later, he ran the second leg for Trinidad and Tobago in the Men's 4x400m relay, making considerable ground of the USA's Gil Roberts before handing the baton to Machel Cedenio. The team ultimately went on to win gold. In September later that year, Richards announced that he was turning professional, and foregoing his final year of collegiate eligibility; he signed an endorsement deal with Adidas. Despite turning pro, he remains enrolled at Alabama to continue work towards his degree. In March 2018, he competed in the 2018 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Birmingham, as the second leg of Trinidad and Tobago's 4x400m relay squad. Despite being the defending champions, they ultimately came fourth. Richards tried to overcome Poland on the second leg but remained third on the second lap. Lalonde Gordon gave up on the line, giving Belgium the bronze. ==References * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Trinidad and Tobago male sprinters Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2014 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2018 Commonwealth Games Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Trinidad and Tobago Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Trinidad and Tobago Category:People from Point Fortin Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2019 Pan American Games Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for Trinidad and Tobago Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for Trinidad and Tobago Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Pan American Games competitors for Trinidad and Tobago Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships medalists Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists in athletics Category:World Athletics Championships winners ","title":"Jereem Richards"},{"id":"35173396","text":"Maksym Yakhno (; born 3 April 1988) is a professional Ukrainian football midfielder who last time played for club FC Helios Kharkiv in the Ukrainian First League.

They currently include: the archdeacons of Southwark, of Reigate (formerly of Kingston-on-Thames) and of Lewisham & Greenwich (formerly of Lewisham), the Archdeacon of Croydon and the archdeacons of Wandsworth and of Lambeth. Each one has responsibility over a geographical area within the diocese. ==History== The Diocese of Southwark was created on 1 May 1905 from two Diocese of Rochester archdeaconries: the archdeaconry of Southwark and the archdeaconry of Kingston-on-Thames. Parts of Surrey (from the dioceses of Winchester and of London) had first been transferred to Rochester diocese on 1 August 1877, and were organised into the Southwark archdeaconry on 3 May 1878. The Kingston archdeaconry was then created by Order in Council soon after, on 22 August 1879, by splitting the archdeaconry of Southwark. Not long after the diocese's creation, the new archdeaconry of Lewisham was created, on 6 March 1906, from part of the Southwark archdeaconry and part of the diocese not previously in an archdeaconry. The archdeaconry of Wandsworth was created in 1973, the Croydon archdeaconry was moved from the Diocese of Canterbury on 1 January 1985.Podmore, Colin ‚Äì Aspects of Anglican Identity, p84 (Google Books) (Accessed 23 February 2013) In 1986, the archdeaconry of Reigate was created from a renaming and reorganisation of the previous archdeaconry of Kingston- on-Thames and the archdeaconry of Lambeth was created from Southwark archdeaconry.

Scott was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2013.http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/blog/rob- rang/22153198/draft-jaguars-sign-qbs-scott-rodgers ==High school career== Scott attended Centennial high school in Corona, California. His senior year, he led his football team to a 9-1 regular season record, his only loss came to Mater Dei who was led by quarterback Matt Barkley. Scott then led his team to the state championship game where they lost 31-37 to De La Salle. Before his senior season began Scott committed to Arizona. He chose Arizona over Minnesota and various other programs. He was rated a four star prospect by Rivals.com and the fifth ranked dual threat quarterback in the country. He is the youngest of four boys, three of which played quarterback at his high school, Centennial. ==College career== In his freshman season Scott was the backup to senior Willie Tuitama and was used mostly as a change of pace quarterback who could run the ball. In this role Scott gained 188 yards rushing averaging 8 yards per carry and scoring two touchdowns. In his limited opportunities to pass he completed 7 of his 11 attempts for 84 yards and 1 touchdown. Scott was the starting quarterback entering the 2009 season. He got the Wildcats off to a 2-0 start in the 2009 season, however in the third game of the season against Iowa he was pulled in favor of backup Nick Foles. Scott played poorly against Iowa completing only four passes and throwing an interception for a total of 50 yards. Scott played sparingly the rest of the year. He saw some action in a blowout win against Washington State, a blowout bowl loss to Nebraska, and was used as a change of pace quarterback to run in other games. Foles however had established himself as the starting quarterback and the best option to run offensive coordinator Sonny Dykes' pass heavy offense. Entering the 2010 season Scott was the backup quarterback to Foles following Foles' superior play after Scott's benching the previous season. In the summer before the 2010 season Scott said that he \\"can't stand sitting on the bench\\" and that he had \\"never been a bench warmer since Pop Warner.\\" He also said that he was open to a possible position switch to wide receiver so that he could play. Scott got to play in the first two games of the season after Arizona had gained a sizable lead against their opponents Toledo and Citadel. After the first two games Scott did not see any action again until the Washington State game. Foles left the game with an injury that would turn out to be a dislocated knee. Scott came in and was able to fend off Washington State and secure a win. Scott would start the next two games while Foles recovered from his injury. In the two games Scott started in Foles' absence Arizona won both times beating Washington by thirty points and going to UCLA to win there. Foles came back for the next game against Stanford and Scott was relegated back to his backup role. The Wildcats concluded the season on a 5-game losing streak finishing 7-6. During the 2011 season Scott redshirted while Foles would start every game. Foles played close to every snap and a backup quarterback was rarely used. By redshirting Scott got the opportunity to come back for a fifth season and have the possibility of starting, rather than running out of eligibility as a backup quarterback. Rich Rodriguez was hired to be the new head coach of the Wildcats for the 2012 season. This was seen as a positive for Scott who many saw as a perfect fit for Rodriguez's spread option offense because of his speed and mobility. Scott flourished with Rodriguez as head coach. He passed for more than 3,000 yards and threw 21 touchdowns. Following an upset of Oklahoma State Arizona entered the top 25 rankings. They completed another big upset when they beat preseason favorite USC in Tucson. Scott played this game on his parents 27th anniversary and dedicated the win to them. He stated that his parents were at every game he played in and was thankful to have the family support he had during this crazy ride in Arizona. Scott's greatest statistical performance of the season came in defeat however. Against Stanford he set school and Pac-12 records for attempts and completions and passed for 491 yards against Stanford. The 491 yards is third in school history. He finished his career with a win against Nevada in the New Mexico Bowl. He engineered a 17-point fourth quarter comeback in the game, throwing for three touchdowns in the final quarter to help Arizona win 49-48.

It is a step toward moving the airline industry to purely electronic transactions in the business-to-consumer context. ==Overview== The flaw with electronic tickets is that they only document one very simple type of transaction: a passenger boards a plane at point A and gets off at point B, and the airline charges (1) airfare and (2) taxes. At the time e-tickets were first implemented in the 1990s, this simple data structure was not a major problem because most airlines still practiced product bundling. That is, it was simply expected in most major markets that the price of a ticket included many other ancillary services like (1) checking up to two regular-sized bags and (2) one or two in-flight meals. During the 1990s and 2000s, many airlines became financially distressed due to numerous factors: deregulation, competition from low-cost carriers, rising fuel prices, and economic shocks in the form of the dot-com bubble and later, the Great Recession. Low-cost pioneer Ryanair became notorious for raising ancillary revenue in the form of unbundling every possible component of airfare and adding it back on through optional fees. However, because e-tickets are not designed to carry such additional information, many airlines are not able to actually charge those additional fees until the passenger makes their first direct contact with the airline through its Web site or at an airport check-in kiosk or counter. This slows down check-in and frustrates consumers. To facilitate these new business processes, airlines either have implemented nonstandard proprietary mechanisms (such as when selling tickets through their own direct-to-consumer Web sites) or are tracking such transactions on paper forms, coupons or vouchers. The IATA EMD standard document is enabling the fulfillment, payment and tracking of usage of the services booked through travel agencies (using global distribution systems) or through the airline's direct distribution channels (via airline's CRS) in a seamless process. ==Standard== The IATA EMD standard is documented in IATA Passenger Service Conference Resolution Manual in resolutions 725F, 725G, 725H. Two types of EMD exist: * EMD-A associated to an e-ticket * EMD-S standalone EMD implementation is part of an IATA Simplifying the Business program called e-services, endorsed by IATA Board of Governors. Since 2009, IATA Board of Governors endorsed the replacement in IATA BSP (for GDS agents sales) of current Virtual Miscellaneous Charge Orders (VMCO) and Virtual Miscellaneous Multi-purpose Documents (VMPD) at the end of 2013 by 100% EMD. This mean that starting 2014, VMCO and VMPD should not be processed anymore by IATA BSP. At the beginning of November 2013, IATA confirmed the sunset of vMCO documents in January 2014 and announced a delay to sunset the vMPD until November 2014. vMCO documents have been removed from IATA BSP in January 2014. Since 1 November 2014, vMCO and vMPD documents are not anymore supported in IATA BSP, therefore IATA BSP only supports EMD and e-tickets. The following Computer reservations system have implemented the IATA EMD standard for airlines direct sales: * Amadeus CRS from Amadeus IT Group * Mercator from The Emirates Group * Resiber from Iberia (airline) * SabreSonic from Sabre (computer system) * SITA * Travelport * Travelsky * HP axsRES and Shares The following Ticket System Providers have implemented the IATA EMD standard for travel agencies sales: * Abacus * Amadeus * Axess * Farelogix * Infini * Sabre * Travelport (Apollo, Galileo, Worldspan) * Travelsky * IATA WebLink The following System Providers have developed their own EMD management system : * Hexaware (HexEMD) == Implementation == More than 180 airlines implemented the IATA EMD standard at the end of 2014. For example, Finnair was an early adopter of the IATA EMD standard \\"launching the first EMD in Europe\\". Air China was the first Chinese airline to adopt the IATA EMD standard in 2010. The list of airlines having implemented the IATA EMD standard is disclosed by IATA on IATA e-services project page. At the end of 2014, the IATA EMD standard document had been issued and processed in 82 IATA BSP by more than 130 airlines. More than 52 million EMD were issued in 2014, representing more than 2 billion USD. == Interline == Just like the electronic ticket, the electronic miscellaneous document also supports interline standards. == References == * IATA Passenger Service Conference Resolution Manual * IATA e-services ==External links== * Category:International Air Transport Association ","title":"Electronic Miscellaneous Document"},{"id":"35173627","text":"April 14-15, 1912: RMS Titanic sinks, killing 1,630 people Animation (in minutes) of the Titanic sinking The following events occurred in April 1912: ==April 1, 1912 (Monday)== * British hopes that Robert Falcon Scott had reached the South Pole before Roald Amundsen of Norway were ended when the Terra Nova arrived in New Zealand without Captain Scott on board, and the news that the Scott team had still been 150 miles from the Pole as of January 3.

It is the type species for the genus Belonogaster. ==Breeding== The nest is similar in form to that of the Polistes paper wasp's nest and is started in a similar way. However, as B. juncea is quasisocial no foundress wasp becomes a dominant queen and all foundresses are full egg-layers, as are any daughters which can mate with males and then join the nest working and laying alongside their mothers. In Cameroon, B. juncea juncea mostly nests in buildings, but nests nave been constructed in the shelter of large boulders. Nests were started throughout the year either by a single female or by groups of two to eight females. Predation and disease meant that only half of the colonies in one study produced at least one adult offspring, and only 10% were able to produce males from the 15% that managed to rear any sexual individuals. ==Queen succession== When the original foundress disappears the remaining females fight for dominance, leading to a reduction in breeding success. Almost half of the surviving nests are then abandoned and the average colony lasts about seven months. In small minority of nests, some females remained on the nest and began a new colonial cycle illustrating semi-independence between colony and nesting cycles. The maximum number of successive cycles to be completed in the same nest was four. The queens of B. juncea therefore demonstrate serial polygyny.Undo M., Mony R. & Dejean A. 2002 Colony development and serial polygyny in the primitively eusocial wasp Belonogaster juncea juncea (Vespidae: Polistinae); Journal of insect behavior; 15 243-252 ==Behavioural roles== Studies of B. juncea have discerned four behavioural roles for individual adult wasps in a colony. Reproduction is reserved to one individual and the \\"workers\\"‚Äô are divided into foragers, builders and guards. The foragers are females that spend the majority of their time foraging to supply the nest with prey and water. Builders are individuals that will bring wood pulp to the nest and then use it to repair or expand the nest. Guards are those females that spend most of their time being inactive on the nest to defend it and its contents from threats.Tindo M., Turilazzi S. & Dejean A.; 1997, Behavioral role differentiation in the primitively eusocial wasp Belonogaster juncea juncea (Hymenoptera: Vespidae); Journal of insect behaviour 10 571-580 ==Distribution== It ranges through most of Africa south of the Sahara, from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in East Africa and south to South Africa, including the island of Zanzibar.

It features the story of a young girl named Tanya, who has the ability to see mythical creatures. ==Awards== 13 Treasures won the 2009 Waterstone's Children's Book Prize. ==Synopsis== 13 Treasures follows its lead character, 13-year-old girl Tanya, who has the rare ability to see and hear the fairies and other creatures who inhabit the woods and many other places. But over the years Tanya has learned to lie about the fairies if something is wrong to anyone, because she has landed herself on a therapist and doctor's couch by this ability. Tanya summers with her grandmother in Elvesden Manor as a punishment for having another fairy incident in Essex. The manor has been given down to all family members up until now. Fabian, the son of Warwick also lives in Elvesden Manor, and with Warwick's father, Amos. Amos has been under suspicion for the 5 decade old disappearance of a young girl named Morwenna Bloom in the nearby woods. He was the last person to see her. At first, Tanya and Fabian are unsympathetic to each other, but as they spend time together they start becoming friends. In Tickey End - the local village - Tanya meets the reclusive 'witch', Mad Morag, who gives her an old compass. Tanya finds a unique silver bracelet while cleaning out an old library one day. On this bracelet there are thirteen charms. She also finds newspaper clippings about a girl named Morwenna Bloom who mysteriously disappeared 50 years ago. As Tanya and Fabian team up, and they decide to investigate this disappearance and to prove that Fabian's grandfather, Amos, is innocent. Tanya also finds and befriends a girl named Red (or Rowan) who saves changelings, or fairy babies exchanged with human babies, from dying in a hospital because their disguise spells wear off and they are killed for their looks. It is revealed that one can only have the \\"second sight\\" of being able to see fairies by having a changeling in their family. The changeling in Tanya's family turns out to be Elizabeth Elvesden. Tanya, Red, and Fabian go out into the woods following Morwenna's hidden instructions in a poem, but it turns out Morwenna went into the fairy world 50 years ago and now wants to come back. The reason Tanya's grandmother doesn't like Morwenna is because Tanya's grandmother (Florence) almost went into the fairy world herself, but didn't at the last second. Morwenna thought critically of her for that and threatened to take Tanya's mom into the fairy world. However, Florence tricked her into giving her 28 more years. Now Morwenna wants Tanya. Bound in vines at midnight, Red causes a distraction and Tanya's dog eats Morwenna's fairy, Feathercap. Red immediately starts to work on cutting the vines, but realizes it is too late. Meanwhile, Fabian runs back to the house to find Morwenna's lock of hair in the human world that is keeping her from aging. It turns out Amos loved Morwenna and blames himself for her disappearance. It is also revealed that Warwick is a fairy hunter who took a special potion to be able to see fairies. Fabian and Warwick take the hair to the middle of the forest and burn it. As Tanya is about to get dragged into the fairy world, Red cuts her own hand and the vines take her instead. Tanya goes back to the mansion, but sees Morwenna on the way. Having her lock of hair destroyed, Morwenna suddenly ages 50 years and the shock kills her. Morag finds her the next morning dead from heart failure. Tanya returns to the mansion and talks with her grandmother, and they forgive each other. ==References * About the book Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:2009 American novels Category:2009 fantasy novels Category:American children's novels Category:2009 children's books ","title":"13 Treasures"},{"id":"35173691","text":"Leslie Cole (born February 16, 1987) is an American sprint athlete.

It lies between the latitudes 50.512¬∞N and 51.081¬∞N and the longitudes 1.682¬∞W and 2.958¬∞W, and occupies an area of 2,653 km¬≤ (1,024 sq mi). It spans from east to west and from north to south. The geology of Dorset is varied; most of the different rocks found in the wider south-east of England outcrop within its boundaries. The oldest rocks (formed in the Early Jurassic epoch) are found in the west of the county; a general progression eastwards reveals younger strata formed in the Middle and Late Jurassic epochs, and the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. Many of the sea- cliffs in the county, particularly around the town of Lyme Regis, are very rich in exposed fossils. Dorset's terrain is lowland in nature, albeit hilly in many parts. The highest point in the county is Lewesdon Hill, 279m above sea-level. The landscape of much of the county comprises hills formed by strata of the Chalk Group; these hills include the Dorset Downs (sometimes called the North Dorset Downs), parts of the South Dorset Downs, and the Purbeck Hills. To the north of the Dorset Downs is the Blackmore Vale, a relatively low-lying area of clays and limestones of Jurassic age. The south- east of the county forms part of the Hampshire Basin, an asymmetric syncline covered in sands and gravels of Paleogene age. The main rivers in the county are the Stour, Frome and Piddle. The Stour is the county's largest river, although its source is in the neighbouring county of Wiltshire. The Frome and Piddle both lie wholly within the county. The whole of Dorset's coastline is designated part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, and contains examples of many different coastal landforms, reflecting the variety of the underlying geology. At 191m Golden Cap is the highest cliff on the south coast of England. The natural resources of Dorset again reflect its particular geology. Western Europe's largest onshore oilfield lies under the south-east of the county. Portland stone and Purbeck limestone have both been quarried for centuries to provide construction material for buildings around the world. Purbeck ball clay is quarried for use in the production of fine pottery. The predominant land use in Dorset is agriculture. On the chalk hills this is largely arable, whereas in the valleys and vales it is more mixed with pasture. The sand and gravel soils between the towns of Dorchester and Poole were historically covered in heathland, although much of this is now afforested. 53% of the county is designated as being an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and there are 139 Sites Of Special Scientific Interest, covering an area of . Dorset is a largely rural county; the county's largest and only major urban area is the South East Dorset conurbation, based on the towns of Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch, with a combined population of around 400,000. The population of the county overall is 714,900. The conurbation has a green belt surrounding it to prevent urban sprawl and afford other protections to the wider area. ==Area== rightthumb Dorset's district and unitary authorities: 1 Weymouth and Portland 2 West Dorset 3 North Dorset 4 Purbeck 5 East Dorset 6 Christchurch 7 Bournemouth (Unitary) 8 Poole (Unitary) Neighbouring counties are: A - Devon, B - Somerset, C - Wiltshire and D - Hampshire) Dorset is a county located in the middle of the south coast of England.

Dorset County Council is further divided into 6 districts: West Dorset, North Dorset, East Dorset, Purbeck, Christchurch, and Weymouth and Portland. ==Geology== Geological map of Dorset The geology of Dorset is varied; most of the different rocks found in the wider south-east of England outcrop within its boundaries.Wightman, R.,\\"Portrait Of Dorset\\", Hale, 1983, p9 The geological structure of the county is easily visible in places, making Dorset a suitable place for geological study. The rocks outcropping in Dorset are all of sedimentary origin, and were formed in the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological history. The oldest rocks are found in the west and north of the county, the youngest in the east. The south-east of the county occupies the western end of the Hampshire Basin, an asymmetric syncline which underlies a large part of central southern England. ==Hills and vales== Dorset Downs Typical landscape of the Dorset Downs The Dorset Downs are chalk hills formed by strata of the Chalk Group, a geological unit which also covers much of southern and eastern England. The chalk which comprises the downs was formed in the Cretaceous period, when the area now known as Dorset was below sea-level. The Dorset Downs are the largest outcrop of the chalk within Dorset, and occupy much of the central part of the county. They stretch northeastwards from Eggardon Hill and Beaminster Down in the west of the county, to Bell Hill and Shillingstone Hill overlooking the River Stour near Blandford Forum. The chalk hills continue on the other side of the Stour Valley as Cranborne Chase. The Downs are part of the northern rim of the Hampshire Basin, which dips gently to the southeast from the steep north- facing scarp slope. The dip slope of the chalk is incised by seasonal streams or winterbornes, which have formed several roughly parallel valleys aligned north to south. Blackmore Vale The Blackmore Vale is a broad vale of relatively low-lying land in the north of the county. Its boundary is indistinct, but roughly conforms to that part of the catchment area of the River Stour that lies north of the Dorset Downs and west of Cranborne Chase. It partly lies within south Somerset. The underlying rock strata are mostly of Jurassic age, comprising broad bands of clay (Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay) separated by narrower bands of limestone (Corallian limestone and Cornbrash), with a narrow outcrop of Early Cretaceous Greensand and Gault clay close to the chalk hills. The alternating bands of clay and limestone result in the floor of the vale being gently undulating rather than flat.Wightman, R.,\\"Portrait Of Dorset\\", Hale, 1983, pp17-18 Marshwood Vale The Marshwood Vale is a bowl-shaped valley in the extreme west of the county. Its floor is composed of Lower Lias clayWightman, R.,\\"Portrait Of Dorset\\", Hale, 1983, p19 which produces wet ground most suitable for pasture. It is drained by the River Char, which flows southwest to the coast at Charmouth. It is surrounded by hills, including the two highest points in the county, Lewesdon Hill (279 metres) and Pilsdon Pen (277 metres). Ridge-top view looking east along the Purbeck Hills Purbeck Hills The Purbeck Hills are a line of chalk hills running roughly east to west along the centre of the peninsula known as the Isle of Purbeck. They are formed of chalk of the same Chalk Group as the Dorset Downs to the north; beyond the Purbeck Hills the visible chalk extends westwards into the South Dorset Downs, which join the northern downs west of Dorchester. The Purbeck Hills are a monocline, a step-like geological fold dating from about 30 million years ago, resulting from the same collision of tectonic plates which built the Alps. Gaps in the ridge at Corfe Castle and Arish Mell are due to faults causing weakening of the chalk. Cranborne Chase Cranborne Chase is composed of a continuation of the same chalk strata which form the Dorset Downs to the south-west; it is divided from the Downs by the valley of the River Stour, which cuts through the chalk at Blandford Forum. Cranborne Chase lies partly within the neighbouring county of Wiltshire. It is a sparsely populated area that is well-wooded in parts. The name 'chase' comes from its previous use as a hunting area.Gant, R., Dorset Villages, Hale, 1980, p24 ==Rivers and lakes== River Stour River Stour at Longham, north of Bournemouth At 60 miles in length, the River Stour is Dorset's longest river, although its source is just outside the county boundary at Stourhead in Wiltshire to the north. It enters Dorset near the village of Bourton, then flows generally southwards through the Blackmore Vale via the towns of Gillingham and Sturminster Newton. Virtually the whole of the Blackmore Vale is within the Stour's catchment area. It leaves the Blackmore Vale in a deep valley which it has cut through the chalk hills; it hence forms the divide between the Dorset Downs to the southwest and Cranborne Chase to the northeast. It is the only one of Dorset's rivers to pass through the chalk in this way. It then flows generally southeastwards through Blandford Forum and around the northern suburbs of Bournemouth, to enter the English Channel through Christchurch Harbour. It is tidal for about the last 3 miles. The main tributaries of the Stour are the River Cale and River Lydden in the Blackmore Vale, and the Moors River and River Allen which join the Stour in its lower reaches after it has passed through the chalk. River Frome At 30 miles in length, the River Frome is only half the length of the Stour, however unlike the Stour, the Frome lies wholly within the county boundary, rising in the village of Evershot on the Dorset Downs, and entering the English Channel through Poole Harbour. Its catchment area is 181 square miles, or one sixth of the county. It also differs from the Stour in that in its upper reaches it is a chalk stream, and even when it leaves the chalk and flows over acid sands and gravels east of Dorchester, its load of sediment from the chalk is sufficient to counteract the acidity and create fertile pasture and watermeadows.Wightman, R.,\\"Portrait Of Dorset\\", Hale, 1983, p11 The main tributaries of the Frome are the River Hooke and River Cerne. River Piddle (River Trent) The River Piddle (alternative name: River Trent) follows a similar and almost parallel course to the Frome, rising a few miles to the east on the chalk downs near the village of Alton Pancras, then flowing roughly southeastwards through chalk and over sands and gravels to reach the English Channel through Poole Harbour. Along its course it gives its name to several villages, each bearing the prefix 'Piddle' or 'Puddle'. The Piddle is the only river in Dorset to have an alternative name. Other rivers There are several smaller rivers and streams in Dorset which do not form part of the catchments of either the Stour, Frome or Piddle. Many of these drain short tracts of land between coastal hills and the English Channel. In the extreme west, the River Char drains the Marshwood Vale and enters the Channel at Charmouth. The River Brit rises north of Beaminster, flows south through Bridport and enters the Channel at West Bay. Near the village of Burton Bradstock, about 1 mile east of the mouth of the Brit, is the terminus of the small River Bride; this rises at Bridehead in the hills between Dorchester and Bridport, and flows westwards for about seven miles \\"before sinking into the shingle\\"Gant, R., Dorset Villages, Hale, 1980, p152 of Chesil Beach. Further east along the coast is the River Wey, which flows into Radipole Lake in Weymouth, and enters the Channel through Weymouth Harbour. Blue Pool near Furzebrook Lakes Dorset has no large freshwater lakes, and the more notable freshwater lakes in the county frequently exist as a result of human activity rather than being naturally occurring. Some large country estates, for example Sherborne Castle and Crichel House, have lakes as part of the landscaping of their grounds. The ball clay workings on the Isle of Purbeck have left behind a legacy of numerous small lakes, the most notable of which is the Blue Pool. Brackish lagoons Dorset has several brackish bodies of water, including The Fleet, Radipole Lake and Lodmoor. ==Coastline== Excluding the shoreline of Poole Harbour, the Dorset coastline is long Dorset County Council and faces the English Channel. It stretches from Lyme Regis in the west to Highcliffe in the east. The main settlements on the coastline are, from west to east, Lyme Regis, Weymouth, Swanage, Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch, although the majority of the coastline is not covered by urban development. The Dorset coastline contains a great variety of coastal landforms, including cliffs, bays, headlands, a large natural harbour and a barrier beach. Jurassic Coast Golden Cap on Dorset's Jurassic Coast Almost the entire length of the Dorset coast forms the major part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, designated in 2001. This coast is notable for the variety in its geological structure and resultant landforms, and for the abundance of fossils found within its cliffs. The rocks of the Jurassic Coast in Dorset range in age from the Early Jurassic in the west to the Cretaceous in the east. Within the length of Dorset's coast can be found examples of a nearly circular cove (Lulworth Cove), a very clearly exposed and accessible geological fold (Stair Hole), a natural sea arch (Durdle Door), sea stacks (Old Harry Rocks), an active landslip (Black Ven), and numerous and often quite spectacular cliffs, including the highest cliff on England's south coast, Golden Cap. Isle of Portland The Isle of Portland is a tied island lying in the English Channel less than south from Weymouth, at roughly the midpoint along the Dorset coastline. It measures approximately 4 miles in length and 1.5 miles in width at its widest point. It is connected to the mainland only by the narrow strip of shingle which forms Chesil Beach. It is composed entirely from Portland limestone rock, which has been extensively quarried for centuries for use as a building stone. The main settlement on the peninsula is Fortuneswell. Between Fortuneswell and Weymouth is Portland Harbour, one of the largest man-made harbours in the world. Isle of Purbeck The Isle of Purbeck is a broad peninsula in the south-east of the county, bounded by the English Channel to the south and east, and by Poole Harbour to the north. The chalk ridge of the Purbeck Hills traverses the middle of the peninsula from west to east. To the north of the ridge are several areas of heathland, which in many places have been excavated for Purbeck Ball Clay. The Purbeck coast is varied and contains sandy bays, headlands of chalk and limestone, and also shales and the small onshore oil well at Kimmeridge. The main settlement on Purbeck is the coastal resort town of Swanage. Poole Harbour Poole Harbour is a large but shallow natural harbour in the south-east of the county, to the north of the Isle of Purbeck and to the west of the South East Dorset conurbation. It is one of the world's larger natural harbours, covering 14 square miles. It was formed about 6,000 years ago after the last Ice Age, as a rising sea-level flooded the valleys of the rivers Frome and Piddle, Bournemouth Echo which now flow into the harbour from the west. The harbour's entrance, on its eastern side between the Sandbanks peninsula and South Haven Point, is narrow, less than 0.25 miles across. Its shoreline is irregular and heavily indented with numerous small inlets and channels, between which many small peninsulas extend out into the body of the harbour. The harbour also houses several small islands, the largest of which is Brownsea Island. Chesil Beach Chesil Beach from the Isle of Portland Chesil Beach is a barrier beach on the southwest coast of the county. It is long and stretches between West Bay and the Isle of Portland, Southampton University although the name Chesil Beach is often only applied to the stretch south-east of Abbotsbury, where it is separated from the land behind it by the large body of brackish water called The Fleet. Chesil Beach is composed of shingle and pebbles which are graded in size from the smallest particles in the west to the largest in the east. == Environment == Green belt Dorset contains all its green belt in the south of the county, surrounding the Bournemouth/Poole conurbation, along with other nearby communities, affording a protection between it and the Cranborne Chase and the West Wiltshire Downs AONB. It was first drawn up in the 1950s. ==Natural resources== Oil Dorset possesses 3 onshore oil fields in the southeast of the county, at Wareham, Kimmeridge and Wytch Farm. Wytch Farm lies between the Purbeck Hills and Poole Harbour; the Purbeck Monocline defines the field's southern limit. Wytch Farm has been producing oil since 1979. A few miles to the southwest at Kimmeridge, a nodding donkey has been pumping up oil from beneath the shale cliffs there since the late 1950s, although yields are declining. Portland stone The Isle of Portland has been extensively quarried for Portland stone for centuries. Portland stone is an oolitic limestone that is greatly valued as a building stone because it has an attractive appearance, is easy to work, and resists weathering. It has long been used in the construction of important buildings both in the UK and around the world. Purbeck limestone Purbeck limestone is a building stone which is quarried on a small scale in the Isle of Purbeck. Purbeck marble, a particular type of Purbeck limestone, used to be quarried there but is now only occasionally extracted in small amounts for particular renovation projects. Purbeck ball clay Purbeck ball clay is composed of kaolinite, mica and quartz. It is of sedimentary origin, having been formed during the Eocene epoch in the particular depositional environment of the then subtropical Wareham Basin. It is thus found today on the northern half of the Isle of Purbeck, to the north of the Purbeck Hills, and is used in the production of fine pottery. It has been quarried on a large scale since the middle of the 18th century; Dorset's first railway was constructed in 1806 in order to transport the excavated material. It is still being excavated today. ==References== ","title":"Geography of Dorset"},{"id":"35173755","text":"Sergio Ezequiel Unrein (born 16 June 1991) is an Argentine footballer who plays as a striker for Club Atletico Union Santiago. ==Career== Club In January 2018, Unrein went on trial with Kazakhstan Premier League club Irtysh Pavlodar.

The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist lateral forces, leading to greater strength than a straight wall of the same thickness of bricks without the need for buttresses. The phrase \\"crinkle crankle\\" is an ablaut reduplication, defined as something with bends and turns, first attested in 1598 (though \\"crinkle\\" and \\"crankle\\" have somewhat longer histories). However, it was not until the 18th century that the term began to be applied to wavy walls. At that time these garden walls were usually aligned east-west, so that one side faced south to catch the warming sun. They were used for growing fruit. Many crinkle crankle walls are found in East Anglia, England, where the marshes of The Fens were drained by Dutch engineers starting in the mid-1600s. The construction of these walls has been attributed to these engineers, who called them slangenmuur (nl), meaning snake wall. The county of Suffolk claims at least 50 examples, twice as many as in the whole of the rest of the country. The term \\"crinkle crankle\\" is said to derive from a Suffolk dialect. The crinkle crankle wall running from the former manor house to All Saints' Church in the estate village of Easton is believed to be the longest existing example. In Lymington, Hampshire, there are at least two examples of crinkle crankle walls. The older of the two is thought to have been constructed at the time of the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815) by exiled Hanoverian soldiers living in the adjacent house. As a minor part of a larger system of fortification, such a wall may have been used to force oncoming troops to break ranks from closed to open ranks, and further expose them to defensive assault. Thomas Jefferson (1743‚Äì1826) incorporated serpentine walls into the architecture of the University of Virginia, which he founded. Flanking both sides of its landmark rotunda and extending down the length of the lawn are ten pavilions, each with its own walled garden separated by crinkle crankle walls. Although some authorities claim that Jefferson invented this design, he was merely adapting a well-established English style of construction. A university document in his own hand shows how he calculated the savings and combined aesthetics with utility. == References == Category:Types of wall ","title":"Crinkle crankle wall"},{"id":"35173774","text":"Concerto da camera (H 196) is a concerto in three movements for the unusual combination of flute, English horn, and string orchestra written by Arthur Honegger late in his career in 1948. While Honegger was on tour in the United States, the American art patron Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge commissioned him in July 1947 to write a piece, either a sonata or a chamber work, that would treat the English horn as a soloist.Halbreich, p. 196 As soloist she had in mind Louis Speyer, English horn player of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, to whom the piece is dedicated. Honegger accepted the commission in early August, preferring a concerto form. However, just then he started to suffer for the first time from angina, a condition that would eventually end his career. On August 21 the angina led to coronary thrombosis, and his wife came over to the States to find him incoherent.Halbreich, p. 194 Honegger did recover, but had to cancel his tour, which also had meant to include Latin America. In November, he returned to France, necessarily by boat. Except for two orchestrations, he would not write music until after a vacation with his and Paul Sacher‚Äôs family in Ireland in the summer of 1948, immediately after which he started writing the Concerto da Camera. He finished the bucolic first movement (Allegretto amabile) in August, the second movement (Andante) in September and the finale (Vivace) on October 28.Halbreich, p. 200 Honegger described the movements as such: \\"The first part is based on very simple themes of popular character which stand out against the background of string harmonies from which they arise. The Andante contains a melodic theme, which progresses from solemnity to a sharp brilliance in an atmosphere of somewhat melancholy calm. The finale has the feeling of a scherzo.\\"William Wallace McMullen, Soloistic English horn literature from 1736-1984, p.16 The soloists perform largely in counterpoint rather than in imitation and dialogue, especially in the second movement where the flute flutters 32nd notes over and around the English horn‚Äôs warmly expressive lines. The piece lasts about 17 minutes and has been described to be \\"breaking the bonds of tonality without even slightly offending the listener's ear\\"Geoff Kuenning, Program notes to Concerto da Camera , 1996 and to be \\"gracious for the player and delightful to the listener\\".Eric Goldberg, Concerto da camera, for flute, English horn & string orchestra, H. 196 at allmusic.com. The second movement has been compared to a prayer of thanksgiving tinged with the quiet gratitude of one who has recently survived an almost fatal illness.Geoffrey K. Spratt, Arthur Honegger, Grove Music Online The first performance was on 6 May 1949, in Z√ºrich, with Andr√© Jaunet on flute and Marcel Saillet on English horn, accompanied by the Collegium Musicum Z√ºrich conducted by Honegger‚Äôs friend Paul Sacher.Halbreich, p. 204 The first American performance was in April 1950 in Minneapolis with Henry Denecke conducting the Northwest Sinfonietta chamber orchestra. ==Sources== *Harry Halbreich, Arthur Honnegger: Un musicien dans la cit√© des hommes, translated by Roger Hichols, Amadeus Press, Portland, 1999, ==References== Category:1948 compositions Category:Compositions by Arthur Honegger Category:Concertos for English horn Category:Flute concertos Category:Music commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge ","title":"Concerto da camera (Honegger)"},{"id":"35173787","text":"Jernail Hayes (born July 8, 1988) is an American sprint athlete.

It was developed as an easy way to present the recordings of the brain wave activity from an electroencephalogram (EEG) during a period of sleep. It allows the different stages of sleep: rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) to be identified during the sleep cycle. NREM sleep can be further classified into NREM stage 1, 2 and 3. The previously considered 4th stage of NREM sleep has been included within stage 3; this stage is also called slow wave sleep (SWS) and is the deepest stage of sleep. Each of the three NREM stages as well as the period of REM sleep and the awake state can be determined and displayed on a hypnogram. ==Method== Example hypnogram of a normal, healthy adult Here, both stage 3 and stage 4 are shown; these are often combined as stage 3. Hypnograms are usually obtained by visually scoring the recordings from electroencephalogram (EEGs), electrooculography (EOGs) and electromyography (EMGs). The output from these three sources is recorded simultaneously on a graph by a monitor or computer as a hypnogram. Certain frequencies displayed by EEGs, EOGs and EMGs are characteristic and determine what stage of sleep or wake the subject is in. There is a protocol defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for sleep scoring, whereby the sleep or wake state is recorded in 30-second epochs. Prior to this the Rechtschaffen and Kales (RK) rules were used to classify sleep stages. ==Output== Normal sleep Cycles of REM and non-REM stages make up sleep. A normal healthy adult requires 7‚Äì9 hours of sleep per night. The number of hours of sleep is variable, however the proportion of sleep spent in a particular stage remains mostly consistent; healthy adults normally spend 20‚Äì25% of their sleep in REM sleep. During rest following a sleep-deprived state, there is a period of rebound sleep which has longer and deeper episodes of SWS to make up for the lack of sleep. On a hypnogram, a sleep cycle is usually around 90 minutes and there are four to six cycles of REM/NREM stages that occur during a major period of sleep. Most SWS occurs in the first one or two cycles; this is the deepest period of sleep. The second half of the sleeping period contains most REM sleep and little or no SWS and may contain brief periods of wakefulness which can be recorded but are not usually perceived. The stage that occurs before waking is normally REM sleep. Hypnograms for healthy persons vary slightly according to age, emotional state, and environmental factors. Disrupted sleep Sleep architecture can be evaluated using hypnograms, demonstrating irregular sleeping patterns associated with sleep disorders. Disruptions or irregularities to the normal sleep cycle or sleep stage transitions can be detected; for example a hypnogram can show that in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) the stability of transition between REM and NREM stages is disrupted. The effects of certain medications on sleep architecture can be visualised on a hypnogram. For example, the anticonvulsant Phenytoin (PHT) can be seen to disrupt sleep by increasing the duration of NREM stage 1 and decreasing the duration of SWS; whereas the drug Gabapentin is seen to revive sleep by increasing the duration of SWS. ==Analysis== The main use of a hypnogram is as a qualitative method to visualise the time period of each stage of sleep, as well as the number of transitions between stages. Hypnograms are rarely used to provide quantitative data, however it has been suggested that statistical evaluation can be carried out using multistate survival analysis and log- linear models to provide numerical significance. ==Limitations== The restrictions of measuring sleep at short 30-second epochs limits the ability to record events shorter than 30 seconds; hence, the macrostructure of sleep can be evaluated while the microstructure is not. The sleep process is smoothened out in hypnogram results unlike it occurs naturally. Also some specific features of sleep such as sleep spindles and K complexes may not be defined in the hypnogram; this is particularly true for sleep scoring that is automated. The method of obtaining the data used in a hypnogram is restricted to the input from an EEG, EOG or EMG. The interval of recording may include features from several stages, in which case it is recorded as the stage whose features occupy the recording for the longest duration. For this reason, the stage of sleep may be misrepresented on the hypnogram. ==Research directions== Suggestions to improve the automated output of hypnograms to provide more reliable and accurate results include increasing the measures of sleep, for example by additionally measuring sleep with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Another advancement involves combining hypnograms with color density spectral arrays to improve the quality of sleep analysis. ==References *American Academy of Sleep Medicine *National Institutes of Health Category:Sleep medicine ","title":"Hypnogram"},{"id":"35174011","text":"\\"Blye, K., Part 2\\" is the 17th episode of the third season of the American crime drama television series NCIS: Los Angeles, and the 65th episode overall. It originally aired on CBS in the United States on February 28, 2012. The episode is written by Dave Kalstein and directed by Terrence O'Hara, and was seen by 15.85 million viewers. ==Plot== Kensi survives being shot by a sniper thanks to body armor that resulted in her only suffering from a cracked rib. She follows the sniper who is now believed to be the man who killed her father. She gets rid of her phone as she wants to go after her father's killer on her own without the help of her NCIS colleagues. At HQ, the OSP team discover Granger has gone off the radar and begin to suspect him to be the killer as he was in the same unit as Donald Blye and Harris, codenamed 'Oscar Sierra'. Kensi finds she is being followed but surprise attacks the driver and steals the car, whose Satellite Navigation System leads her to a house where she sees a man and a woman talking. Deeks shows up to bring her in which she refuses. She tells Deeks to look after the woman who is later revealed to be Kensi's estranged mother, Julia Feldman. After Eric and Nell find footage of Granger fleeing the shooting, Callen and Sam discover him in Kensi's ransacked apartment, and bring him to Hetty for answers. Granger then comes clean and reveals he had 2 suspects all along: Kensi Blye and Peter Clairmont, the Commanding Officer of Oscar Sierra who died in a car crash in 2006, but upon closer inspection of the files Granger concluded the crash was staged, and that Clairmont is actually alive and faked his death because he killed Donald Blye. Callen & Sam realise that in 2006, Kensi Blye joined NCIS and started investigating her fathers unit, which spooked Clairmont when she began getting close and forced him to start killing off Oscar Sierra team members. Granger calls Kensi and reveals to all that Oscar Sierra was responsible for the death of Brad Stevens, an American reporter. Kensi realises that the man she saw talking to her mother was Clairmont, and whilst Kensi goes off to speak with Brad Stevens' daughter, Deeks nervously explains to Kensi's mother why he's there and brings her back to the boathouse where Callan and Hanna are surprised to see her. She explains the relationship between herself and Kensi. The woman Kensi speaks to is not the real person and it is a trap, Kensi kills the impostor and receives a call from Claremont, who taunts her into coming after him. The team discover the imposter worked as part of a team for Clairmont. Kensi goes back to her mother's house and lures Clairmont and his team there whilst leaving a clue for Callen and the others to find her. A brutal fight ensues between her and Claremont as the two engage in hand-to- hand combat while Callen, Sam, Deeks and Granger engage in a gunfight against the four members of Clairmont's team. After a vicious and intense fight, Kensi wins but doesn't kill him, simply stating that he won't last long while implying that his injuries are so severe that there's a chance he'll die. As she turns her back on him, Claremont, seeking revenge uses the last ounce of his strength to produce his gun with the intention of shooting Kensi but Granger, having quickly spotted the move draws his own gun and shoots Claremont, killing him while also saving Kensi's life much to the shock and surprise of Callen, Sam and Deeks. A tape is found containing evidence with the potential of convicting Claremont. Stevens' final story was going to be about Clairmont getting into a drunken fight and killing a civilian, which would've damaged Claremont's reputation, seen his cover being blown and destroyed his career, so he arranged for Stevens to be killed before the story could be finished. Kensi's father tried to warn the reporter but was killed for it. Granger reveals that Stevens was supposed to come to him for safety, but never made it; and this was his way of setting things right. Kensi is also given her father's sniper journal. The episode ends with Kensi sitting alone on a beach while reading a letter her father wrote to her in the journal. After she's finished, she visits her mother and finally makes peace with her. ==Production== The episode centers around Daniela Ruah's character Kensi Blye.\\"Blye, K., Part 2\\" is written by Dave Kalstein and directed by Terrence O'Hara. The episode is the second of a two-part arc centred on NCIS Special Agent Kensi Blye. According to Daniela Ruah, who portrays Kensi, \\"[Kensi is] determined to prove her dad‚Äôs death was a murder and not an accident. She wants to crack the case. But at the same time, she‚Äôs extremely emotionally attached to this case, which can cloud your judgment sometimes\\". The premise for the two-part arc is set up in Kensi's appearance on Hawaii Five-0 back in October 2011. \\"Something happened while she was there. That‚Äôs when the fuse was lit\\", say executive producer Shane Brennan. In connection with this, it's shown why Kensi joined NCIS. \\"It‚Äôs a very surprising reason, and it‚Äôs a very dangerous reason\\". Miguel Ferrer is recurring as NCIS Assistant Director Owen Granger. ==Reception== \\"Blye, K., Part 2\\" was seen by 15.85 million live viewers following its broadcast on February 28, 2012, with a 9.9/15 share among all households, and 3.1/8 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"Blye, K., Part 2\\" came third, behind the original NCIS and American Idol. Clara Day from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 (out of 5) and stated that \\"until now, Kensi's past has been almost as big a secret as Callen and Sam's have been. We knew her father was a military man and she was curious about his death.

In the show, a panel of archeologists, art historians, and natural history experts were asked to identify interesting objects or artifacts from museums from Britain and abroad, and other faculties, including university collections. The quiz show was presented by the BBC, continuing a long history of bringing contributors to archaeology into the media limelight. Writing in 1953, the critic C.A. Lejeune described the show as having \\"a sound, full-bodied, vintage flavour\\". ==History== The UK television show was modelled on an American TV show called What in the World? that was developed by Froelich Rainey. The first episode of Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? was broadcast in October 1952 and was hosted by Lionel Hale and produced by Paul Johnstone. Hale soon stood down as chairman, after an early episode in which he was challenged by Thomas Bodkin about the age of one of the objects shown, in favour of the archaeologist Glyn Daniel, who continued as the regular chairman and scorer for the next seven years. The most frequent member of the discussion panel was the renowned archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler, who was voted TV personality of the year in 1954, providing the world of archaeology with its first media star. Daniel won the award the following year. The last episode of original series was broadcast in 1959, after which the programme was cancelled, partly because of Daniel's association with Anglia Television. It was briefly, and unsuccessfully, revived as A.V.M? in 1971, directed by Bob Toner, with Barry Cunliffe as the chairman. ==Programme information== The person responsible for choosing the artefact for each episode was Sir David Attenborough,Sir David Attenborough, Personal Histories who was also the camera director. However, on the Christmas special in 1956, Glyn Daniel and Sir Mortimer Wheeler selected items for Attenborough and other production staff to examine. Inauthentic items were occasionally included: for example, a stone axe made by the forger 'Flint Jack' or fake Crown Derby ware. On one occasion, Sir Julian Huxley was unable to identify a modern mock-up of a stuffed great auk as a fake,Freudian dating parties; Glamorous heritage; Archaeologist Sienna Miller?;The heritage buffs' anthem; Early Animal, Vegetable, Mineral https://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/chris-catling/freudian- dating-parties-glamorous-heritage-archaeologist-sienna-millerthe-heritage- buffs-anthem-early-animal-vegetable-mineral.htm and on another Huxley lost a ¬£1 bet after failing to recognise the egg of the African giant snail. Occasionally the presenter would try to fool the panel with a corroded modern artefact e.g. a part of a pram or a bicycle. The signature music for the series was the prelude to Partita No. 3 in E major by Johann Sebastian Bach. ==Controversies== Wheeler often \\"cheated\\" by investigating beforehand which objects had been removed from their next location, and looking up the relevant information about the corresponding items in catalogues. Nevertheless, Wheeler once stormed off set after taking offence when a junior producer offered to show him the planned items before an episode was filmed. In 1957, an episode was broadcast in which the panel were asked to identify the ethnic origins of a selection of human volunteers. The anthropologist Margaret Mead disrupted the episode by repeatedly claiming that examples of each ethnic group could be seen at Grand Central Station in New York City. Mead was not invited to take part in the show again. On one occasion, a BBC spokesman stated that Glyn Daniel presented the show while suffering from influenza, as during a discussion about a sheaf of poisoned arrows from the Sarawak State Museum he said on air that \\"there are a few million people I would like to kill - mostly viewers\\". Attenborough explained in his autobiography that Daniel had presented the programme while drunk.David Attenborough, Life on Air (2009) p20-21. On another occasion, Leigh Ashton, the Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, also appeared while drunk, and fell asleep after incorrectly stating the first three objects shown to be fakes. On one of the show's overseas visits, an episode had to be re-located to the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris after the National Archaeological Museum refused permission to film. ==Legacy== The show was the forerunner of other popular BBC archaeology programmes, such as Buried Treasure and Chronicle. It was credited with contributing to the rise in popularity of archaeology in Britain in the 1950s, which resulted in increased museum attendance and library use. On several occasions it caused museums' identifications of objects to be amended based on information provided by the panel or by the viewing public. Its format was often referenced in comedy shows: Not Only...But Also, At Last the 1948 Show, Do Not Adjust Your Set and The Complete and Utter History of Britain each contained sketches with experts analyzing a \\"mystery object\\", often resulting in totally wrong conclusions or, in At Last the 1948 Show, in the items getting destroyed. Even in the 21st century, Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? was still referenced in the second episode of The Armstrong & Miller Show: Its simple set-up was parodied with a fictional black & white program called \\"How many hats?\\". In September 2011, University College London performed a one-off revival of Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?. The panel of experts included Claire Thomson (Scandinavian Studies), Ryan Nichol (Physics and Astronomy), Tom Stern (Philosophy) and Sam Turvey (Institute of Zoology). It was hosted by Joe Flatman (Institute of Archaeology) and consisted of a visit to the UCL museum. ==Episodes== Only four episodes exist in the BBC's archives, three of which are available to watch from the BBC iPlayer.

In addition to the TV broadcast, on Shaw TV, it has a website and print publication. The Week Thus Far has been praised in several magazines and newspapers including: Uptown magazine and Stylus Magazine. The Week Thus Far airs throughout Manitoba. ==Television== The Week Thus Far tapes in front of a live audience at The Kings Head on Monday nights and airs on Shaw TV the next evening and throughout the week.

They were built to operate on branch lines from 1949 with low traffic volumes later being transferred to Newcastle and Wollongong to operate suburban services until withdrawn in 1994. However, one 600 class railcar was converted to solar operation for use on the Byron Bay Train service. The upgraded train entered service on 16 December 2017 and is believed to be the world's first solar-powered train. ==Construction== In January 1946 approval was given for the construction of 10 two car sets. It was decided that they would be constructed at the new New South Wales Government Railways' Chullora Railway Workshops. They were built with an aluminium body on a steel frame. Each consisted of a 600 class powercar and 700 class driving trailer. They were powered by two General Motors 6/71 diesels coupled to an Allison TCLA 655 hydraulic transmission. The power car had 32 economy seats and had provision for eight tonnes of luggage while the trailer seated 24 in economy and 26 in first class. The 600/700s were capable of operating in multiple together and there was at least one instance of four sets operating together. ==In service== The first entered service on 25 January 1949 with all initially deployed on lines throughout country NSW including: *Queanbeyan to Bombala *Goulburn to Cootamundra *Cootamundra to Griffith, Lake Cargelligo and Tumut *Wallerawang to Mudgee *Dubbo to Cobar, Brewarrina, Bourke, Coonamble and Gwabegar *Werris Creek to Gwabegar, Moree and Walgett *Armidale to Glen Innes With the introduction of the DEB set railcars on the Northern Tablelands Express, in April 1959 one was transferred to Newcastle for suburban working being joined by a second from Dubbo. In the mid 1960s some were transferred to Richmond and Wollongong. In 1971 22 Cummins NT855-R26 engines were purchased with the intention of repowering all ten to allow them to operate in multiple with the later 620/720 and DEB set railcars. However, only five were converted also receiving new bogies and being renumbered as 660/760s the other engines being used to repower 620/720s. In November 1983 the final three were withdrawn from rural services from Cootamundra to Lake Cargelligo and Tumut, and from Narrandera to Hay and Tocumwal. They were transferred to Acdep and from November 1984 operated services from between Riverstone and Richmond with a few services starting back at Sydney Central.\\"Goodbye Tin Hare\\" Railway Digest February 1985 page 37 The other seven were all operating out of Newcastle and Wollongong by this stage and had their seating replaced with throwover suburban seating. The Richmond cars were withdrawn following the electrification of the line in August 1991 and the rest when replaced by Endeavour railcars in 1994. Of the 600/700 sets, five cars were scrapped (two following their partial destruction for an episode of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television series Police Rescue in February 1992)\\"600 Class Railcars\\" Railway Digest April 1992 page 155 and four were sold to the Rail Motor Society, Paterson.

Many of them were sailors, conquistadors, clergy, and members of the military. Later Portuguese arrivals included pirates in conflict with Spanish leadership. Today, the country's largest Portuguese community is concentrated in Mexico City, especially in the Colonia Condesa, the home of many restaurants and bars popular with people of Portuguese descent. ==History== The first Portuguese to arrive in New Spain was Sebasti√°n Rodr√≠guez de Oliveira, a companion of Hern√°n Cort√©s. The Portuguese were a significant presence in New Spain, particularly during the Iberian Union. A notable portion of the immigrants were Portuguese Sephardi Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition.Presencia portuguesa en M√©xico Colonial Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla. Portuguese immigrants had no difficulty adapting into New Spanish society because they were Catholics and accountable to the Spanish Crown for taxation. During the Mexican War of Independence, Mexicans did not distinguish between Spanish and Portuguese colonists who were on the side of the Spanish Crown, many of whom were killed or expelled. Only those who wanted to remain loyal to The Spanish Crown were expelled or returned to the Iberian Peninsula, while others stayed and integrated into Mexican society remained and lost touch with the Old World. Portuguese immigrants were granted preferential naturalization times (requiring two years of residence instead of five) in 1993. The preferential naturalization time was granted due to historical and cultural connections and was previously given to Latin Americans (1917) and Spaniards (1939). According to the 2000 Censo General de Poblaci√≥n y Vivienda, there were 311 Portuguese-born residents of Mexico. == Portuguese Mexicans ==  Notable Mexicans with Portuguese origins  File:MARIO ALMADA-2 (cropped).jpgMario Almada, actor.

Produced by Jakob Hazell and Svante Halldin, it was officially released on March 20, 2012 by The Island Def Jam Music Group on digital media stores. The song draws heavy inspiration from space tourism, air, and more prominently, sylphs, as reflected in the music video which premiered on March 22. The song is about \\"merging with the spirit, becoming all love.\\" \\"Zero Gravity\\" debuted at number 32 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart for the week of April 28, 2012. During its eighth week on the chart, the song peaked at number 6 for the week of June 16. ==Background== Kerli debuted \\"Zero Gravity\\" during a performance in Chicago in August 2011 and a demo of the studio version premiered on the Seattle radio station C89.5 on September 2, 2011. On March 6, 2012, C89.5 premiered the final version of the song. == Composition == Kerli recalled thinking to herself upon hearing of space tourism, specifically the project of Richard Branson (who Kerli admires) \\"This is incredible! Who would have known I can witness this during my lifetime? I should write a song about this and it should be called 'Zero Gravity'.\\" Kerli began to write the song shortly before abandoning it. A year later, Kerli was scheduled for two studio sessions while in Stockholm. With only five hours remaining in the second session, Kerli \\"had kinda given up on the idea that any producer would actually get [her] and become [her] musical soulmate\\" before meeting her \\"favorite producers and friends for life\\", Svante Halldin and Jakob Hazell (the team known as \\"SeventyEight\\", who also collaborated on \\"Lucky Ones\\" by Kerli). Kerli played for them the Wolfgang Gartner song \\"Space Junk\\" (2010), stating she \\"wanted to channel that but also mix some ethereal elements into that. Something like Enya or classical music. Something that sounds like angels on acid.\\" The song was finished in the final hours of the session. Kerli stated the lyrics of the song were written in \\"the honor of\\" the air spirit, sylph, and that song is about \\"merging with the spirit, becoming all love\\", continuing to say she \\"[loves] the air element and it kinda seems to be something that keeps popping up throughout the music [she makes].\\" The song begins with a simple 10-note piano chord before being picked up by a synthy drum beat. The pre-chorus features a dizzying up and down feel before the chorus merges the drum beat with the piano chord and some more prominent synths. The second chorus finds a dubstep-like wobble bass before the bridge brings a heavier take on the pre- chorus's dizzy feel, also containing a drop, drawing further inspiration from dubstep. The song ends with the piano chord. == Critical reception == \\"Zero Gravity\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Bill Lamb of About.com called Zero Gravity \\"straightforward dance pop\\", saying \\"the imagery of the accompanying video is more unique\\". Bradley Stern of MTV called the song \\"a trip\\" and compared it to Alexandra Burke's song \\"Elephant\\". == Commercial performance == \\"Zero Gravity\\" debuted at number 32 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, which \\"Army of Love\\" previously peaked at number 1 on. \\"Zero Gravity\\" peaked at number 6 during its eighth week on the chart. == Music video == The two characters (\\"the Sky Princess\\" on the left, \\"Cosmic Geisha\\" on the right) hold their hands out as the sphere glows in between them. The music video premiered on March 22, 2012. It is directed by Canadian director Alon Isocianu. The video begins with Kerli hanging upside down from inside a chrysalis in a forest. Two sylphs wander by and remove her from it. The scene cuts to Kerli singing above clouds in the sky before cutting back to her, now indoors, with the two sylphs who are grooming her. A new scene cuts featuring Kerli as a character which she named \\"the Sky Princess\\" performing in front of another character portrayed by herself, \\"Cosmic Geisha.\\" After the performance, Kerli walks off the stage to meet with her. They each hold out their arms before the glowing sphere in between them explodes. Many creative elements of the music video came from an early treatment written by transmedia artist Jan Lucanus and filmmaker Aurore Barry and developed with Kerli herself. Original designs of the Cosmic Geisha were created by comic book artist Mihailo Vukelic in collaboration with Creative Impulse Entertainment as part of plans for a larger Kerli-themed project. == Track listing == *Digital download # \\"Zero Gravity\\" - 3:51 *Digital remix EP # \\"Zero Gravity (Album Version)\\" ‚Äì 3:51 # \\"Zero Gravity (Extended Version)\\" ‚Äì 6:33 # \\"Zero Gravity (Laidback Luke Remix Edit)\\" ‚Äì 4:03 # \\"Zero Gravity (Laidback Luke Remix)\\" ‚Äì 5:25 # \\"Zero Gravity (Laidback Luke Remix Instrumental)\\" ‚Äì 5:18 # \\"Zero Gravity (Almighty Edit)\\" ‚Äì 3:35 # \\"Zero Gravity (Almighty Extended)\\" ‚Äì 6:32 # \\"Zero Gravity (Ruff Loaderz Dub)\\" ‚Äì 7:17 # \\"Zero Gravity (It's The DJ Kue Edit!)\\" ‚Äì 4:04 # \\"Zero Gravity (It's The DJ Kue Extended Remix!)\\" ‚Äì 7:05 ==Charts== {  !align=\\"left\\"Chart (2012) !align=\\"center\\"Peak position -  US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs  align=\\"center\\"6 } ==References== Category:2012 singles Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Kerli songs Category:Songs written by Kerli Category:2012 songs Category:Songs written by Svante Halldin Category:Songs written by Jakob Hazell Category:Song recordings produced by Jack & Coke ","title":"Zero Gravity (Kerli song)"},{"id":"35174227","text":"This is a list of Belarusian painters. * Meer Akselrod * Peter Blume * Vitold Byalynitsky-Birulya * Marc Chagall * Jonas Damelis * Mai Dantsig * Elena Drobychevskaja * Anatoli Lvovich Kaplan * Michel Kikoine * Irina Kotova * Pinchus Kremegne * Dmitry Kustanovich * Yehuda Pen * Alexandr Rodin * Alfred Isidore Romer * Mikhail Savicki * William S.

The suburb of Overmonnow, which in mediaeval times was an important area for iron working and the manufacture of coarse woollen material including Monmouth caps, would have been vulnerable to attacks from the Welsh at the time the defences were constructed. Excavations in 1966 suggested that the ditch was excavated in two stages, before the mid-thirteenth century, and then again after the mid-fourteenth century. RCAHMW: Clawdd Du, Overmonnow. Accessed 28 January 2012 The ditch originally extended, roughly in a semi- circle, for some from the River Monnow opposite Chippenham Fields, westwards and then northwards to the vicinity of the later Drybridge House. The defence comprised a water-filled ditch some 35 to 40 feet (10-12m) wide, with an embankment some 5 feet (1.5m) high on the side of the settlement, topped by a wooden palisade.M.L.J. Richards, Monnow Bridge and Gate, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1994, , p.3 It was probably possible to flood the ditch from the River Monnow. A mediaeval stone bridge across the ditch was in direct line with that of Monnow Street, in Monmouth, and the Monnow Bridge across the river. It carried the road from the town westwards towards the village of Wonastow.Kissack, Mediaeval Monmouth, p.24 The Clawdd-du defined the outer limit of development at Overmonnow until the 1930s. ==The Clawdd-du today== The Clawdd-du is now partly infilled, but still exists for most of its length as a broad ditch used for drainage. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the remains of the mediaeval bridge are a Grade II* listed building. British Listed Buildings: Clawdd-du Bridge.

The Opposition's purpose is to hold the Government to account and constitute a \\"Government-in-waiting\\" should the existing Government fall.

At times, the Opposition consisted of more than one party, notably when the Coalition parties (the state Nationals and Liberals) were in Opposition. Those state parties entered Opposition in 1996 and merged to form the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) in 2008, National Leader Lawrence Springborg becoming Leader of the LNP and remaining Leader of the Opposition.

By extension, it is a member of the United States Army National Guard, and as a currently federally-recognized unit, also a member of the National Guard of the United States. ==History== Interwar period The 134th Infantry Regiment returned to the United States aboard the USS General G. W. Goethals, arriving at the port of New York on 24 January 1919. The regiment proceeded to Camp Grant, Illinois, where it was mustered out of federal service, demobilized, and personnel discharged on 18 February 1919. Like many other states, Nebraska did not immediately reorganize its National Guard after World War I, instead choosing to wait for the War Department to present it an allotment of troops authorized per the amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916. This proved problematic. The Omaha race riot of 1919 forced the state to call upon federal troops at Fort Crook and Fort Omaha, and when a response was not received in a timely manner, the remaining Home Guard troops nearest the riot and a volunteer force of 300 World War I veterans were mobilized. The riot concluded by the time these troops were ready to move. In late July 1920, after receiving its initial allotment which included one regiment of infantry, provisional companies were gradually organized and federally recognized in towns across the state. This task was completed by the spring of 1921, and the companies themselves were then reorganized to fit the new Militia Bureau tables of organization prescribed for an infantry regiment. As the majority of the units that made up an infantry regiment were organized and federally recognized, Nebraska could then establish battalion and regimental headquarters and headquarters companies. On 1 July 1921, the provisional companies of the Nebraska National Guard were reorganized as the 1st Infantry Regiment, Nebraska National Guard, and the regimental and battalion headquarters and headquarters companies were organized and federally recognized in early July 1921. The 134th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted in the National Guard in 1921 and assigned to the state of Nebraska. It was concurrently relieved from the 34th Division and assigned to the 35th Division. A provision of the 1920 amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916 allowed for units of the National Guard and Organized Reserve that had served in World War I to retain their \\"names, numbers and other designations, flags, and records.\\" On 25 October 1921, the 134th Infantry Regiment was reorganized by a redesignation of the 1st Infantry Regiment, Nebraska National Guard. {  - ! 1920‚Äì1921 Designation !

It is designed to loiter above the battlefield for up to 6 hours before attacking stationary or mobile targets. The cost of Phase 1 of the programme, including concept, assessment, demonstration and initial manufacture, was forecast at around ¬£200 million in 2011. ==Design== Fire Shadow weighs less than 200 kg and is relatively low-cost. It is surface-launched and has a range of approximately 100 km; it can fly to a target area and then loiter for approximately six hours before precision attack on a specific target. Test launches have been performed from a trailer on land. A Royal Navy brochure released in January 2009 revealed that Fire Shadow was compatible with the space envelope of the SYLVER vertical launch system of the Type 45 destroyer, but this option has not been mentioned since the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010. Instead, MBDA have pursued Maritime Fire Shadow as a private venture, with no customers as yet. Their marketing materials at DSEi in September 2011 showed what appeared to be a similar launcher to that used on land, lashed to the helicopter deck of a frigate or helicopter carrier. Includes a video of a Chinook helicopter landing on a ship similar to HMS Ocean to deliver a Fire Shadow canister, which is then lashed to the deck and fired. ==Deployment== The first complete test firing (a test of flight, navigation and control systems) took place on 21 November 2010 at Vidsel, Sweden, followed by a second on 13 May 2011. Operator training started in 2011, with the first deliveries of production systems in March 2012. It was planned that 39th Regiment Royal Artillery would be the first unit to receive the system and would deploy it operationally in Afghanistan by 2012. This plan, however, never materialised. In 2013, the National Audit Office (NAO) reported in its 2013 Major Projects Report that after spending ¬£207 million, the Ministry of Defence had yet to decide on a future for the project. However, Fire Shadow was listed in the National Audit Office's 2014 Major Projects Report as being among the eleven largest equipment projects where the Ministry of Defence has taken the main decision to invest. ==References== Category:Guided missiles Category:Post‚ÄìCold War missiles of the United Kingdom Category:Loitering munition ","title":"Fire Shadow"},{"id":"35174817","text":"Small Wonder is a collection of 23 essays on environmentalism and social justice by American novelist and biologist Barbara Kingsolver, published in 2002 by Harper Collins.

The cover shows two scarlet macaws, the subject of one of the essays, in flight against a tropical forest. ==Context== Kingsolver wrote the book in response to the 9/11 attacks, with the theme of 'reclaiming' patriotism for Americans who did not agree with the current direction of the country. The essay \\"And Our Flag Was Still There\\" was first published in the Los Angeles Times and her views such as \\"In my lifetime I have seen the flag waved over the sound of sabre-rattling too many times for my comfort\\" received an angry response from many US commentators. Some of the essays were co-written with Kingsolver's husband Steven Hopp, an ornithologist. ==Reception== Rosemary Canfield-Reisman noted that the book was not as well-received as her other work and that it was \\"labeled unpatriotic by some reviewers and naive by others.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle said that \\"Kingsolver is admirably humane and intellectually consistent. Her economy of language is a genuine asset in the often overwrought genre of expository writing. But the book, which tackles such weighty issues as the Kyoto environmental agreements and social injustice, is too self-referential to be effectively persuasive.\\" Natasha Walter in The Guardian wrote that \\"although I was rooting for these essays from the first page, over and over again, just as Kingsolver was heating up the rhetoric, I would find myself turning cold\\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly argued that \\"A reader in the wrong mood might impatiently brush away some of the flakier granola crumbs that come with the territory [but it] glows with Kingsolver's honest literary language of enchantment, and with an eye for details of the living planet that Gerard Manley Hopkins might admire.\\" The New York Times' Laura Ciolkowski concluded that \\"Small Wonder has a lot to say, but its heavy-handed wisdom is unfulfilling.\\" ==References== Further reading * - a chapter about teaching Small Wonder and High Tide in Tucson ==External== * *Harper Collins reading guide Category:2002 non-fiction books Category:Essay collections by Barbara Kingsolver Category:Books about the September 11 attacks Category:HarperCollins books Category:American essay collections ","title":"Small Wonder (essay collection)"},{"id":"35174913","text":"Dag Heyerdahl Larsen (25 October 1955 - 7 January 2012) was a Norwegian translator.

(Bill) Ramson (1933‚Äì2011) at the Australian National University. Ramson was motivated by a lack of lexicographic work on Australian English on historical principles, in the tradition of the Oxford English Dictionary. The project gained funding from Oxford University Press and the first edition of the Australian National Dictionary was published by Oxford in 1988, coinciding with the bicentenary of Australia's settlement. It was the first comprehensive, historically based record of the words and phrases that make up the Australian contribution to the English language. It records the historical development of Australian words, phrases and meanings from their earliest use to the present day, providing evidence of this history in dated and referenced quotations drawn from over 9,000 Australian sources. The trials and tribulations of this process are outlined in Ramson's book Lexical Images (OUP, 2005). The first edition of the dictionary is available online.

Pricing is in separate tiers for voice minutes, text messages, and data, which is adjusted month-to-month to match actual usage. Ting supports devices that run on Sprint (CDMA), T-Mobile (GSM) and Verizon's (CDMA) cellular networks depending on the frequencies of the device. Devices can be purchased through Ting's website or other sellers. The customer then enters the device's electronic serial number on Ting's website to activate the device. Ting provides a device checker to advise what level of compatibility the device will have on their CDMA and GSM networks.  History  The company first announced support for devices that functioned on Sprint or its subsidiaries. A public beta was then launched on December 6, 2011, offering official support for seven Sprint-branded smartphones; the announcement also included links to a substantial list of other compatible devices and a new discussion area for users attempting to activate them. Ting Mobile officially launched in February 2012. On December 9, 2014, Ting Mobile announced GSM services going live in February 2015 using \\"a major US network provider\\", being the T-Mobile US network. Ting customers can have phones on either network within the same account. The GSM service allows the majority of US cellphones to be brought to Ting. On February 24, 2015, Ting Mobile offered public beta access to their GSM network with the official product launched a few months later. , the service has approximately 250,000 subscribers. On July 10, 2019, Ting Mobile announced that it will not renew its network agreement with T-Mobile after December 19, 2019, citing uncertainties over its proposed merger with Sprint and will partner with Verizon. Ting has renewed its network agreement with Sprint for an additional year until September 2020. Ting later announced that they had reached an agreement that would allow them to continue to offer T-Mobile service for at least three years after December 2019. On August 3, 2020, key Ting Mobile assets were acquired by Dish Network Corporation, which is in the process of launching a national wireless carrier. This carrier will use prepaid assets (including Boost Mobile) sold by Sprint as a condition of their 2020 merger with T-Mobile (which also includes an agreement for use of their network for seven years). As part of the agreement, Dish will also subcontract backend services (including provision and billing) for its wireless business to Tucows. The sale does not include the Ting branding or Ting Internet division; Dish will receive a two-year transitional license to the Ting branding, but will have the option to acquire it at a later date. ==Ting Internet== On December 15, 2014, Ting announced it was buying ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks of Charlottesville, Virginia, which was already building fiber Internet. They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting has also launched a similar service in 5 other markets: Westminster, Maryland, Holly Springs, North Carolina, Sandpoint, Idaho, Centennial, Colorado and Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. In May 2016, Ting Internet launched the Bring Your Own Router option, allowing customers to use Ting's optical network terminal (ONT) at no additional cost, while pairing it with their own 3rd party router. ==See also== * List of United States mobile virtual network operators ==References * Category:Mobile phone companies of the United States Category:Dish Network Category:Tucows ","title":"Ting Inc."},{"id":"35175165","text":"Normanton Park (1818) by John Preston Neale Normanton Hall was a large, now demolished, country house at Normanton in Rutland. ==History== Normanton was the possession of the De Normanvilles for fourteen generations following the Norman Conquest. The estate then passed in 1446 to Alice Basings who was married to Thomas Mackworth, of Mackworth, Derbyshire. The house was then in the possession of the Mackworths for several generations. Thomas Mackworth, High Sheriff of Rutland for 1599 and 1609, was created a baronet on 4 June 1619. Sir Thomas Mackworth, 4th Baronet was ruined by electioneering costs in the early 1720s and was forced to sell. The estate was bought by Sir Gilbert Heathcote, 1st Baronet, Lord Mayor of London, in 1729.Robinson, p. 142 His son, Sir John Heathcote, 2nd Baronet, rebuilt the hall between 1735 and 1740 to the design of Henry Joynes and Sir Gilbert Heathcote, 3rd Baronet enlarged the hall to the design of Kenton Couse between 1763 and 1766. A large central bow window designed by Thomas Cundy was added around 1800.Robinson, p. 145 In the 18th century the village was cleared to make a park for the estate of the Heathcote family with the population mainly re-housed in Empingham and the old church on the estate was rebuilt in 1764 in a new location by the 3rd Baronet. The deconsecrated St Matthew's Church, Normanton, now in the middle of Rutland Water In 1827 Sir Gilbert Heathcote 5th Baronet (later Lord Aveland) married Clementina Willoughby, (later Baroness Willoughby d'Eresby) who was heiress to the Ancaster estates. Following the death of Evelyn, Countess of Ancaster the estate was sold off in 1924 but as the mansion could not be sold intact, a further auction in 1925 sold the fixtures and fittings and the shell was demolished.Heritage of Rutland Water, edited by Robert Ovens and Sheila Sleath (2007) The stable block of the hall is now the Normanton Park Hotel. The church, due to be demolished with the construction of Rutland Water, has been rescued and is reachable by a causeway. ==References== *Robinson, John, Felling the Ancient Oaks, Aurum Press, 2011, Category:Country houses in Rutland Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century ","title":"Normanton Hall"},{"id":"35175172","text":"Cecun () is a township-level division situated in Qin County, in south-central Shanxi province, China.

The lithosphere is the thin, outer, rigid layer of the Earth resting on the asthenosphere, a viscous layer that in geological time scales behaves as a fluid. Thus, when loaded, the lithosphere progressively reaches an isostatic equilibrium, which is the name of the Archimedes principle applied to these geological settings. This phenomenon was first described in the late 19th century to explain the shorelines uplifted in Scandinavia due to the removal of large ice massed during the last glaciation. G. K. Gilbert used it to explain the uplifted shorelines of Lake Bonneville.\\"Lake Bonneville\\" US Geological Survey Monograph No. 1. 1890. 438 p. The concept was not retaken until the 1950s by Vening Meinesz. The geometry of the lithospheric bending is often modeled adopting a pure elastic thin plate approach (sometimes by fitting the gravity anomaly produced by that bending rather than more direct data of it). The thickness of such plate that best fits the observed lithospheric bending is called the equivalent elastic thickness of the lithosphere, and is related to the stiffness or rigidity of the lithosphere. These lithospheric bending calculations are typically performed following the Euler-Bernoulli bending formulation, or alternatively the Lagrange equation (Love-Kirchhoff). ==References== Category:Geodynamics ","title":"Lithospheric flexure"},{"id":"35175337","text":"The discography of Epica, a Dutch symphonic metal band, consists of seven studio albums, two live albums, two extended plays (one under the name of Sahara Dust), one soundtrack, and fourteen singles. ==Albums== Studio albums {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" - !

She was kidnapped on July 24, 2011, and her corpse was found beheaded two days later in the neighbor port town of Boca del R√≠o. The crime hasn't been solved, there have been no detentions and different hypothesis exist. The general attorney in the state of Veracruz, Reynaldo Escobar, said that the investigation was considering the alleged relationship of some journalists with the organized crime. Notiver saw these declarations as a menace to journalists and linked the slaying to Ordaz's investigation of the murder of three colleagues a month earlier. ==Background== Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz was the fourth journalist killed in Veracruz in 2011, in the context of the Mexican Drug War. The first was Noel L√≥pez Olgu√≠n in March. On July 20, Notiver crime columnist Miguel √Ångel L√≥pez Velasco, his wife, and their son Miseal L√≥pez Solana, who also worked at Notiver as a crime photographer, were murdered in their home.Journalist, 2 family members murdered in Mexico , EFE from foxnews.com In 2012 drug trafficking related violence increased in Veracruz, including the murder of Proceso's journalist Regina Mart√≠nez in April and the killing of four media professionals in May, including Guillermo Luna Varela, who had been colleague of Ordaz at Notiver. The state of Veracruz is faced with crime primarily from Los Zetas drug cartel. Since early 2010, there have been multiple shootings and gunfights that have broken out from the territorial fight between Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Ordaz had been a close friend to the L√≥pez family as she and Miguel L√≥pez had worked together for years. Just a week before her death, Yolanda Ordaz had questioned the general attorney Reynaldo Escobar because of the lack of results in the investigation about her colleagues' murders. At the time of her own murder, she was looking into her co-workers' deaths. ==Death== Yolanda Ordaz received several letters with death threats before she was killed. The journalist was reported missing by her relatives on Sunday night July 23, 2011. She had told them she was going out to cover a story and never returned home. On Tuesday July 26, 2011, her body decapitated was found with signs of torture, and her head was found behind the offices of the Imagen del Golfo news station, in Boca del R√≠o. There was note written in Spanish saying \\"Friends can also betray you. Sincerely, Carranza.\\" Juan Carlos Carranza, former transit police officer and allegedly a local leader of Los Zetas, had been signaled by the general attorney as the main suspect of the murder of the family L√≥pez Velasco. The case is open and the motivations of the crime are still unclear. The day after the murder general attorney Reynaldo Escobar said Ordaz's murder was a settling of scores between crime gangs, but he didn't present any proof. Journalist also published in his column similar allegations. Notiver requested publicly the resignation of Escobar for these declarations A few days after the crime the Mexican army killed two alleged drug cartel members, and the prosecutor said that one of them had an identification of Yolanda Ordaz. Also, a couple of accusatory videos were published anonymously in Internet, mentioning Ordaz as a mediator for Los Zetas. Other journalists speaking under anonymity said to McClatchy that L√≥pez and Ordaz may have been passing information to military intelligence and were killed by crime gangs in vengeance. ==Reactions== Many reporters for the Notiver newspapers went into hiding or were not showing up for work after 3 of their co-workers have been killed in the last two months.

It has been listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites since 1964 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. ==History== The attached houses were built at the same time around 1800 by John Lenthall. They were originally located at 612‚Äì14 19th Street NW. Lenthall was a trained architect who was born in England in 1762 and was the great- grandson of Sir William Lenthall, who was Speaker of the House of Commons. He moved to Washington around 1793 and was chosen by Benjamin Latrobe as his principal assistant on his project to build the United States Capitol in 1803. His wife, Jane King, whom he married in either 1801 or 1802, was the daughter and sister of the surveyors of the District of Columbia. Lenthall was killed in September 1808 when one of the arches in the Supreme Court chamber collapsed. The house at 610 21st Street NW stayed in the Lenthall family until 1902 when it was sold. It was eventually purchased by Washington artist Bertha Noyes. The Arts Club of Washington was founded in her home in 1916. Noyes deeded the property to George Washington University upon her death in 1966. The house at 606 21st Street, NW was deeded to William Francis in August 1808. He in turn deeded the property away the following day. George Washington University acquired the house in the 1970s. The structures were moved to their current location on August 5, 1978. ==Architecture== The houses were designed in the Federal architectural style. They were designed as a single unit and they share a common roof and cornice line. The exterior is covered in red brick laid in Flemish bond. They are two stories in height and include an attic and a basement. The grey saddleback roof features two wooden dormers, one on each house. Both the north and the south gables have two chimneys each. A brick partition wall was built between the two house up to the attic where a partition of a lath and plaster separates the two houses. The main facade is six bays wide, with three bays belonging to each house. The two entrance doors are adjacent to each other in the center of the facade. The white wooden trim surrounding the doorways was changed in the second half of the nineteenth century. ==NotesReferences Category:Federal architecture in Washington, D.C.

Ansar Dine (  æAn·π£ƒÅr ad-Dƒ´n, also transliterated An√ßar Deen; meaning \\"helpers of the (Islamic) religion\\") also known as Ansar al-Din (abbreviated as AAD) was a militant Islamist group led by Iyad Ag Ghaly, one of the most prominent leaders of the Tuareg Rebellion (1990‚Äì1995) who is suspected of having ties to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is led by his cousin Hamada Ag Hama. Ansar Dine seeks to impose strict Sharia law across Mali.Armed Islamist group claims control in northeast Mali, AFP The group's first action was in March 2012. The organization is not to be confused with the Sufi movement An√ßar Dine, started in Southern Mali by Ch√©rif Ousmane Haidara in the 1980s, which is fundamentally opposed to militant Islamism. Ansar Dine is opposed to Sufi shrines.Mali crisis: 'Timbuktu joy after life of fear' retrieved 17 January 2013 ==Organization== Membership Ansar Dine has its main base among the Ifora tribe from the southern part of the Tuaregs' homeland. It has been linked with Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) because its leader Iyad Ag Ghaly is the cousin of AQIM commander Hamada Ag Hama. In April 2012, Salma Belaala, a professor at Warwick University who does research on jihadism in North Africa said that this association was false, claiming that Ansar Dine was opposed to Al Qaeda. Ag Ghaly was also previously associated with the 1990 Tuareg rebellion. The group's members are reported to be from Mali, Algeria, and Nigeria. Omar Ould Hamaha, who served as Ansar Dine's spokesman after April 2012, became the military leader of the AQIM-affiliated Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA) in August 2012. On 24 January 2013, a faction calling itself the Islamic Movement for the Azawad split from Ansar Dine. As of January 2013, this group was led by prominent Tuareg leader Alghabass Ag Intalla. In March 2013 it was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State, and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the United Nations Security Council. and Iraq in 2019.https://moj.gov.iq/upload/pdf/4542.pdf Command structure In Mopti, the Ansar Dine fighters obtained access to heavy construction equipment from fleeing construction workers and used them to build fighting positions. The fighting positions include an elaborate tunnel network and vehicular obstacles such as trenches. Weapons technical in Timbuktu in 2012. Ansar Dine has reportedly put together at least one convoy of 100 vehicles carrying soldiers equipped with small arms. There have also been rumors that fighters may have been able to obtain weapons from Libya's weapons depots after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. The Ansar Dine arsenal also includes anti aircraft weapons which can be mounted on pickup trucks. ==Ideology== The group seeks to impose sharia law across Mali, including the Azawad region. Witnesses have said that Ansar Dine fighters wear long beards and fly black flags with the shahada (Islamic creed) emblazoned in white. According to different reports, unlike the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), Ansar Dine does not seek independence but rather to keep Mali intact and convert it into a rigid theocracy. ==Participation in 2012 northern Mali conflict== March 2012 On 21 March 2012, the group claimed control of Mali's vast northeast regions. The Agence France-Presse reported that Ansar Dine claimed to occupy the towns of Tinzaouaten, Tessalit, and Aguelhok, all close to the Algerian border, and that they had captured at least 110 civilian and military prisoners. France accused the group of summarily executing 82 soldiers and civilians in capturing Aguelhok, describing the group's tactics as \\"Al-Qaeda-style\\". On 22 March, mutineering Malian soldiers unhappy with Amadou Toumani Tour√© overthrew the Malian government in a coup d'√©tat. Taking advantage of Malian disarray, Ansar Dine and MNLA proceeded to take the towns of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu within the following ten days. According to Jeremy Keenan of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Ansar Dine's military contribution was slight compared to the much larger MNLA: \\"What seems to happen is that when they move into a town, the MNLA take out the military base‚Äînot that there's much resistance‚Äîand Iyad [Ag Aghaly] goes into town and puts up his flag and starts bossing everyone around about sharia law\\". April 2012 On 3 April, the BBC reported that the group had started implementing Sharia law in Timbuktu. That day, Ag Ghaly gave a radio interview in Timbuktu announcing that Sharia would be enforced in the city, including the veiling of women, the stoning of adulterers, and the punitive mutilation of thieves. According to Timbuktu's mayor, the announcement caused nearly all of Timbuktu's Christian population to flee the city. On 6 April, the MNLA issued a declaration of independence. However, the military wing of Ansar Dine rejected it hours after it was issued. May 2012 Ansar Dine was reportedly responsible for the burning of the tomb of a Sufi saint, a UNESCO World Heritage site, on 4 May in Timbuktu. The group also blocked a humanitarian convoy bringing medical and food aid from reaching Timbuktu on 15 May, objecting to the presence of women in the welcoming committee set up by city residents; after negotiations, the convoy was released on the following day. In Gao, the group reportedly banned video games, Malian and Western music, bars, and football. On 26 May, the MNLA and Ansar Dine announced a pact in which they would merge to form an Islamist state called the \\"Islamic Republic of Azawad\\". June 2012 However, some later reports indicated that the MNLA had decided to withdraw from the pact, distancing itself from Ansar Dine. MNLA and Ansar Dine continued to clash, culminating in the Battle of Gao on 27 June, in which Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa and Ansar Dine took control of the city, driving out the MNLA. The following day, Ansar Dine announced that it was in control of all the cities of northern Mali. July 2012 In the summer of 2012, members of Ansar Dine broke down the doors of the Sidi Yahya Mosque, which, according to legend, were not to be opened until the Last Days. They claimed that reverence for the site was idolatrous, but offered roughly $100 U.S. dollars to repair the mosque. November 2012 MNLA in Ouagadougou, with Blaise Compaor√©, November 16, 2012 Ansar Dine was in peace talks with Mali's neighbours Burkina Faso and Algeria. January 2013 In late January 2013, during the French Operation Serval against the Islamist fighters in Northern Mali, a faction split off from Ansar Dine, led by Alghabass Ag Intalla(h). It calls itself the Islamic Movement of Azawad (MIA) and claims to be ready for negotiations and to reject extremism and terrorism as well as any association with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. March 2017 In March 2017, Iyad Ag Ghaly appeared in a video, alongside leaders from the Saharan branch of Al- Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Mourabitoun and the Macina Liberation Front, in which it was announced their groups were merging under Ag Ghaly's leadership, in an organisation called Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin. ==References== Category:2012 in Mali Category:Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb Category:Azawad Category:Islamism in Africa Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Iraq Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by the United Kingdom Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the United States Category:Organizations designated as terrorist in Africa Category:Rebel groups in Mali Category:Rebel groups in Algeria Category:Tuareg Category:Islamist groups Category:Jihadist groups Category:Mali War ","title":"Ansar Dine"},{"id":"35175795","text":"is a 2012 Japanese horror anime television series produced by P.A.Works and directed by Tsutomu Mizushima that aired thirteen episodes from 10 January to 27 March 2012.

It was published posthumously in 1657 and, along with its companion work The States and Empires of the Sun, is considered one of the earliest published science fiction stories. Arthur C. Clarke credited the book with the first description of rocket-powered space flight, and with the invention of the ramjet. ==Plot summary== The book is narrated in the first person by a character also named Cyrano. Cyrano attempts to reach the Moon to prove there is a civilization that sees the Earth as its own moon. He launches himself into the sky from Paris by strapping bottles of dew to his body, but lands back on Earth. Believing he had traveled straight up and down, he is confused by local soldiers who tell him he is not in France; they escort him to the provincial governor who informs him that it is in fact New France. The narrator explains to the governor that all matter is formed inside and expelled from stars, and that once the Sun has run out of fuel it will consume the planets and restart the cycle. He uses New France as evidence for this theory, claiming that it had only recently been discovered by European explorers because the Sun had only recently sent it to Earth. The narrator tries again to reach the Moon, this time with a flying machine that he launches off the edge of a cliff. Though the craft crashes, local soldiers attach rockets to it, hoping that it will fly to celebrate the feast day of St. John the Baptist. Dismayed at this use of his machine, the narrator attempts to dismantle it while the fuse is lit, but the machine takes off and sends him into space. He meets the Moon's inhabitants, who have four legs, musical voices, and fantastical weapons that cook game for a meal as it's shot. He also meets the ghost of Socrates and Domingo Gonsales of Francis Godwin's The Man in the Moone. His discussions with Gonsales include how God is useless as a concept, that humans cannot achieve immortality, and that they do not have souls. After these discussions, the narrator returns to Earth. ==Impact== Inspired by Lucian's proto-science fiction work True History or True Story, The Other World went on to influence many other works seen as early science fiction, including Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels, which is also an example of fantastic voyages exploring both contemporary social commentary, and some ideas of the unknown and \\"modern\\" science. The French comic book series De cape et de crocs, created by writer Alain Ayroles and artist Jean-Luc Masbou, draws inspiration from The Other World and makes frequent references to the work and its author. ==See also== * History of science fiction ==References External links == * *Additional copies: 1 2 3 * Category:1657 books Category:1650s science fiction novels Category:French science fiction novels Category:Space exploration novels Category:Novels set on the Moon Category:Novels by Cyrano de Bergerac Category:17th-century French novels ","title":"Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon"},{"id":"35175857","text":"Munson Hall is a residence hall on the campus of George Washington University, located at 2212 Eye St., Northwest, Washington, D.C. in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood. ==History== The building was designed by Robert O.

Individuals with RD have mutations in both copies of the AK2 gene. Mutations in this gene lead to absence of AK2 protein. AK2 protein allows hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate and proliferate. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to blood cells. Differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells require a lot of energy and this energy is supplied by the mitochondria. The energy metabolism of mitochondria is regulated by the AK2 protein. If there is a mutation in the protein, that means that the mitochondria metabolism most likely will be altered and will not be able to provide enough energy to the hematopoietic stem cells. As a result, hematopoietic stem cells will not be able to differentiate or proliferate. The immune system consists of specialized cells that work together to fight off bacteria, fungi and viruses. These cells include T lymphocytes (T cells), that primarily mediate the immune system, B lymphocytes (B cells) and Natural Killer cells. Patients with RD have a genetic defect that affects the T cells and at least one other type of immune cell. Since more than one type of immune cell is affected, this disease is classified as a severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). A weakened immune system leaves patients susceptible to different kinds of infection. Commonly, patients who are diagnosed with RD also have bacterial sepsis and/or pneumonia.The annual incidence has been estimated at 1/3,000,000-1/5,000,000 and both females and males are affected. == Signs and symptoms == {  !Signs and Symptoms !Approximate Number of Patients Affected - Abnormality of mitochondria metabolism 90% - Abnormality of Neutrophils 90% - Anemia 90% - Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thymus 90% - Cellular immunodeficiency 90% - Decreased antibody level in blood 90% - Diarrhea 90% - Hearing Impairment 90% - Recurrent respiratory infection 90% - Sepsis 90% - Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% - Malabsorption 50% - Weight Loss 50% - Dehydration 7.5% - Skin rash 7.5% - Skin Ulcer 7.5% } == Risk factors == * Condition follows an autosomal recessive pattern ** The mutated gene must be inherited from both the mother and father ** Both males and females must have an equal frequency of inheritance == Diagnosis == Health professionals must look at a person's history, symptoms, physical exam and laboratory test in order to make a diagnosis. If the results show patients with low levels of lymphocytes, absence of granulocytes or absence of thymus then the patient may be suspected to have RD. == Treatment == RD can only be treated temporarily through Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and Cytokine Therapy.  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Transplantation of stem cells are taken from the bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cord of healthy, matched donors. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) involves intravenous infusion of stem cells to those who have either a damaged bone marrow or defective immune system. Transplantation is a simple process. Bone marrow product is infused through a central vein over a period of several hours. The hematopoietic cells are able to go to the bone marrow through tracking mechanisms. Patients who suffer from RD will now have more stem cells that can differentiate into immune cells.  Cytokine Therapy  Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) can be used as a temporary cure. GM-CSF stimulates production of white blood cells. This cure is commonly used in patients who are awaiting bone marrow transplantation. Response to this cure can vary. Those with a more severe combined immunodeficiency may have no response to this therapy. == Prognosis == The survival range is estimated to be 3 days to 17 weeks without treatment. Patients die due to bacterial or viral infections. Aggressive treatment with antibiotics is required and bone marrow transplant is common. Patients undergoing bone marrow transplant, specifically from a matched sibling, have a higher 5 year survival rate than those receiving a transplant from other donors. == Research ==  Gene Therapy  Gene therapy is a relatively new concept in the field of SCID. This therapy is currently undergoing clinical trial and has cured a small number of children suffering from X-linked SCID and recessive allele SCID. Gene therapy aims to correct the underlying genetic abnormality in SCID. In the case of RD, the genetic abnormality would be AK2 malfunction. Stem cells are taken from an affected child's blood or bone marrow. Then in laboratory conditions the stem cells are manipulated and corrected with gene technology. They are then injected back into the patient. Similarly, in bone transplant, stem cells are able to find their way back through tracking mechanisms. == References  External links == Category:Rare diseases Category:Genetic disorders by system Category:Combined T and B‚Äìcell immunodeficiencies Category:Noninfectious immunodeficiency- related cutaneous conditions ","title":"Reticular dysgenesis"},{"id":"35175892","text":"The Barendrecht train accident involved the collision between two freight trains on 24 September 2009 near Barendrecht, Netherlands.

It is the home of the Michigan Tech Huskies NCAA football team and the soccer team. It regularly seats 3,000 fans. The surface of the field was grass until 2008, when MTU announced that turf was being installed. The field is named in honor of the late Donald P. Sherman, a former athletic director and coach at Michigan Tech. Sherman first arrived in 1929 at what was then known as the Michigan College of Mining and Technology. His first duties involved serving as the basketball coach and assistant athletic director. Sherman became athletic director in 1936 and was made a full professor of economics in 1943. Besides strengthening the four major varsity sports (hockey, football, basketball, and track), he also added three other sports (boxing, tennis, and skiing) to the Huskies‚Äô athletic program. Sherman was also credited with initiating and developing Michigan Tech‚Äôs first intramural sports program. His untimely death in 1946 from a heart attack after playing handball came as a great shock to the school and local community. Sherman Field‚Äôs largest crowd came on the first-ever night football game on September 29, 2012 against Grand Valley State. The 4,684 fans set a new Sherman Field record and also a record for the largest crowd at a home Michigan Tech sporting event. In August 2018, Tech athletics completed phase one of the stadium project, which includes new bleacher seating for 2,100 fans and accessible parking along with concrete for the VIP Pavilion. Michigan Tech is currently in the fundraising phase for phase two that includes an expanded press box, coaching boxes, additional bleachers, restrooms and concessions. The current accommodations were completed in 1989. For 2019, the facility was re-named Sherman Field at Kearly Stadium in honor of former coaches Ted and Tom Kearly (2006-19). Ted Kearly was the head coach from 1969-72, compiling an overall record of 29-7, including three consecutive 8-1 seasons and three NIC Championships in four seasons. His son, Tom, was Tech's head coach for 11 seasons, spanning the 2006 through 2016 campaigns, and his career record stands at 70-44, with his winning percentage of .614 is the second highest in program history. Kearly guided the Huskies to a 9-2 overall record and the NCAA Playoffs in 2014. In 2012, Kearly led Tech to a 7-3 record and Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference North Division title. On September 28, 2019, it was officially dedicated in a pregame ceremony of the season's home opener and homecoming game against Grand Valley State University. ==References== Category:College football venues Category:American football venues in Michigan Category:Michigan Tech Huskies football ","title":"Sherman Field"},{"id":"35176056","text":"Carnegie Hall Concert is an album by trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie recorded in 1961 at Carnegie Hall, New York City and released on the Verve label.Dizzy Gillespie discography accessed March 22, 2012Payne, D.

Paris Saint-Germain Football Club holds many records, most notably being the most successful French club in history in terms of official titles won, with 43. Domestically, PSG have clinched nine Ligue 1 championships, a record thirteen Coupe de France, a record nine Coupe de la Ligue, a record nine Troph√©e des Champions and one Ligue 2 title. In international club football, they have claimed one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Additionally, PSG have won 24 unofficial titles. Their victory in the 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup makes PSG the sole French side to have won this trophy as well as one of only two French clubs to have won a major European competition and the youngest European team to do so. The Parisians are also the club with the most consecutive seasons in the top- flight (46 seasons in Ligue 1 since 1974‚Äì75). Furthermore, PSG are the only side to have won the Coupe de France without conceding a single goal (1992‚Äì93 and 2016‚Äì17), five Coupe de la Ligue in a row (2014‚Äì2018), four back-to-back Coupe de France (2015‚Äì2018), and seven consecutive Troph√©e des Champions (2013‚Äì2019). PSG have won all four national titles in a single season on four occasions. This feat is known as the domestic quadruple. The Red and Blues have completed the domestic double, the league and league cup double, the domestic cup double and the domestic treble several times as well. Therefore, PSG are the club with the most domestic doubles and league and league cup doubles, and the only team to have won the domestic cup double, the domestic treble and the domestic quadruple. Influential officials and players in the club's history include most decorated president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, most decorated manager Laurent Blanc, record appearance maker Jean-Marc Pilorget, top scorer Edinson Cavani, assist leader Safet Su≈°iƒá, most capped and longest- serving captain Thiago Silva, Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah, and world-record transfer Neymar. ==Honours== :As of the 2019‚Äì20 season.

According to the 2010 census, there were 13,696 registered Argentine citizens living in Mexico, an increase from the 6,465 registered in the 2000 census. Argentine immigrants constitute the second largest community of South Americans in Mexico (after Colombian Mexicans) and the fifth largest immigrant community overall. The Argentine-Mexican community is sometimes known as ArgenMex. ==History== Argentines have been in Mexico since at least the 1895 census, and periodic migration has continued following the ebb and flow of the Argentine economy. Both countries share the Spanish language; their historical origins are common (part of the Spanish Empire). With two main emigrant waves; during the 1970s Dirty War and after the 2001 economic crisis. The largest Argentine community is in Mexico City (with a sizeable congregation in the Condesa neighborhood) and there are smaller communities in Leon, Guadalajara, Puebla, Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, M√©rida, Monterrey and Tampico. Most Argentines established in Mexico come from the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Cordoba and Tucuman. The Argentine community has participated in the opening of establishments such as restaurants, bars, boutiques, modeling consultants, foreign exchange interbank markets, among other lines of business. ==Culture== Carlos Gardel, tango icon from Buenos Aires. Argentine actors have an important presence in Mexico's television industry. Frequently, actors arrive in Mexico to learn neutral Spanish (based on Mexican Spanish and used for mass media distributed across Latin America, such as dubbed foreign films,) and remain as they find work with one of the country's major television networks. Notable among these actors are the telenovela galanes (male leads) Juan Soler and Sebastian Rulli. In the music industry, prominent Argentine-Mexicans include Amanda Miguel, Fey and Noel Schajris. There has been controversy in Mexico over the inclusion of naturalized Mexicans (especially Argentine- Mexicans) on Mexico's national football team. The arguments range from xenophobic ideas to the belief that Argentines have been granted citizenship in order to be eligible players on the team. Nonetheless, Argentines wanting to attain Mexican citizenship have to do so through meeting naturalization and residency requirements. ==Argentine-Mexicans==  Notable Argentine Mexicans  File:Libertad Lamarque.jpgLibertad Lamarque, actress and singer.

She and her dog survived the ship's sinking, escaping on lifeboat no. 7. Following the disaster, she cared for two small children known as the \\"Titanic Orphans\\" in her New York City home until their mother claimed them. ==Rescue from the Titanic== Margaret Bechstein Hays was born on December 6, 1887 to Frank and Mary A. Hays. She was 24 years old when she boarded the Titanic at Cherbourg, France. She was accompanied by two friends, Olive Earnshaw and Lily Potter. Earnshaw and Hays occupied first class cabin C-54. Gilbert Tucker, a young man Hays had met in Europe, cut his visit short to join her on the Titanic. He occupied cabin C-53. When the ship hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912, Hays and Earnshaw were in their cabin. When the engines stopped they went to Potter's room, and then to inquire about the situation. When they returned to Potter's room they told her: \\"We have hit an iceberg but the steward told us we should not worry and should go back to bed.\\" Although Hays was not concerned, Potter was scared. They dressed and wrapped Hays' Pomeranian dog in blankets. They headed to C Deck, where Tucker helped them collect life jackets.

The occupants of boat 7 were rescued early on April 15 by the RMS Carpathia. Also on the Carpathia were two young boys who spoke only French. Margaret spoke French fluently and she was concerned that they would be separated from one another. She volunteered to take the children into her care until their family could be located. The boys played with Hays' dog, Bebe, while they were on the boat. The identities of the children were initially unknown, but it was determined that they were Edmond and Michel Navratil. Their father, Michel Sr., who died in the accident, had boarded the Titanic under an assumed name. He had taken the children from his estranged wife and was removing them to the United States. Upon her return to New York, Margaret cared for the children, who became known as the \\"Titanic Orphans.\\" She had the help of the Children's Aid Society in caring for the boys until their mother, Marcelle Navratil, came from Nice, France, to claim them. Hays married a Rhode Island physician, Charles Daniel Easton, in 1913 and they had two daughters. She was widowed on October 4, 1934. She died on August 21, 1956, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, of a heart attack while on vacation with one of her daughters. She is buried at St. Mary's Churchyard, Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Margaret Bechstein Hays was not, as has sometimes been claimed, related to victim Charles Melville Hays, an American railroad executive traveling first class on the Titanic with his wife Clara and their adult daughter Orian (both of whom survived) and son-in-law (who perished).

Location of Sardinia Sardinian nationalism or also Sardism (Sardismu in Sardinian, Sardismo in ItalianSardismo, lemma, Garzanti Linguistica.) is a social, cultural and political movement in Sardinia calling for the self-determination of the Sardinian people in a context of national devolution, further autonomy in Italy, or even outright independence from the latter. It also promotes the protection of the island's environment and the preservation of its cultural heritage.

Over the years many Sardist parties from different ideological backgrounds have emerged (even on the right and the centre), all being in the minority, and with some of them making government coalitions of variable geometry with the statewide Italian parties.

Sull‚Äôunione civile della Sardegna colla Liguria, col Piemonte e colla Savoia, Cagliari, Timon, 1847, p.4 some Sardinian deputies in the minority, such as Federico Fenu, Giorgio Asproni and Giovanni Battista Tuveri, strongly protested against the Savoyard policies and warned against the ramifications which Sardinia could face. In the end, the king Charles Albert agreed to the request from Turin; by doing so, he dissolved what political bodies remained that could exert a modicum of control on the king's decisions over the island. Moreover, the later enlargement moves in the Peninsula on the Savoyards' part, starting with the First Italian War of Independence, further aggravated the island's political and cultural marginalization with respect to the Mainland: Sardinia ended up being an even less significant overseas departement of the Savoyard domains, whose seat of power had always been located on the Italian peninsula. The episode would lead most of the Sardinian unionists, including Pintor himself, to regret having made that proposal (Errammo tutti, \\"we all made a mistake\\"),Una data infausta per la Sardegna, Francesco Casula - Il Manifesto SardoUn arxip√®lag invisible: la relaci√≥ impossible de Sardenya i C√≤rsega sota nacionalismes, segles XVIII-XX - Marcel Farinelli, Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

La sfida dell‚Äôalterit√† in Il postcoloniale in Italia, Aut Aut n. 349 The Savoyard kings proceeded to expand their domains through the Unification of Italy: Sardinia, being already part of the Piedmontese Kingdom from the very beginning, automatically joined the new polity, which changed its name to become the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Sardism, which had long been confined to the island's intellectuals, made its political debut for the first time on the occasion of Ireland's independence (1921) with Lussu's theories and the Sardinian Action Party or PSd'Az (one of the oldest parties in Europe advocating for regional self-determinationElias (A.) et Tronconi (F.), From protest to power. Autonomist parties and the challenges of representation, Vienna, Braum√ºller, 2011), which got 36% of the popular vote in 1921 regional election.Hepburn, Eve. The Ideological Polarisation and Depolarisation of Sardinian Nationalism, Regional and Federal Studies Vol. 19, No.5. (2010) Sardinian nationalism thus established itself as the most important mass movement in Sardinia, and the Psd'Az a political force that Benito Mussolini eventually banned in 1926; the overt Sardists would then be forced into hiding and some of them participated in the main European fronts of anti-fascism (like Emilio Lussu, and Dino Giacobbe and Giuseppe Zuddas in the Spanish Civil War), while others decided to join the Fascist Party, hoping that by adhering to the regime Sardinia would get autonomy in exchange (a demand facing an immediate rejection) or at least some attention from the Mainland (which they eventually got through some moderate funding concentrated in Cagliari for the local infrastructures). Overall, rural Sardinia showed little interest in the Fascist state, let alone consent, while the bourgeois segments from the urban settlements were among the staunchest supporters of the regime on the island.A History of Sardinia, by Nicola Gabriele (translated by Sally Davies), University of Cagliari Following the Second World War, the Psd'Az, already weakened by the loss of many of its key members during the conflict, suffered a first split between the moderate wing and a much more radical one, led by Sebastiano Pirisi, which developed into another party (Lega Sarda, \\"Sardinian League\\") but ultimately got poor results in the 1946 Italian general election.Basti√† Pirisi, politico e commediografo antifascista, pacifista e separatista, Francesco Casula, La Barbagia.net The return of democracy coincided with the comeback of the previously cracked-down autonomist and separatist claims. A regional chamber to draft the Statute was created on April 9, 1945, but did not operate until as late as April 26, 1946, because of the slow pace of negotiations at each round of the talks. Lussu and the Sardinian Action Party championed in fact a solution that saw the island as a state associated with a federal country, rather than being assimilated like an ordinary Italian region within a unitary framework, but such demands were met with strong opposition from the Italian statewide parties:Cardia, Mariarosa (1992). La nascita della regione autonoma della Sardegna, Franco Angeli the Christian Democracy (DC), around which the majority of the island's notables were then gathered, supported in fact a generic regional framework with some devolution, geared towards accommodation for the central government in Rome; the Liberal Party (PLI) advocated for what little autonomy was needed to carry out only the administrative functions, without the capacity to create any regional laws; the Communist Party (PCI), which shut down the Communist Party of Sardinia two years earlier, was hostile to the idea of giving Sardinia any autonomy at all, the Italian Communists considering it a reactionary tool that stood in the way of a transformation towards a single Italian Communist society; the right-wing parties and the Common Man's Front were against the idea of Sardinian autonomy as well, because of Italian nationalism. In the end, the line prevailing was the one supported by the DC that, claiming to be willing to avoid \\"serious institutional conflicts\\", ditched the federal hypothesis in favour of a binary system of governance agreed upon the region and the central state. As much as some important authors in the field of Sardinian studies regard the granted Statute as Italy's definite acknowledgment of a distinct historical, geographic, social, ethnic and linguistic status,Manlio Brigaglia, Michelangelo Pira, Giuseppe Contini and Girolamo Sotgiu, Trent'anni di autonomia per la Sardegna , in Vindice Ribichesu (edited by), Supplemento al n. 1, gennaio 1978, di Sardegna Autonomia, Consiglio Regionale della Sardegna. Comitato per il XXX dell'Autonomia, Sassari, Gallizzi, 1978\\"Una Sardegna di cittadini e non di sudditi\\" (from \\"Storia dell‚ÄôAutonomia sarda 1847-2018\\", edited by Manlio Brigaglia and Salvatore Mura, Delfino. the \\"Sardinian specialty\\" as a criterion for political autonomy ended up being specified just on the grounds of a couple of socio-economic issues devoid of any of the aforementioned considerations.Pala, Carlo (2016). Idee di Sardegna, Carocci Editore, pp.118Pintore, Gianfranco (1996). La sovrana e la cameriera: La Sardegna tra sovranit√† e dipendenza. Nuoro: Insula, 13 As time was pressing, the Sardinian regional Statute was eventually written by the Constituent Assembly in Rome, followed by a rapid review of each section and without further debate. Some unique articles appeared in the final version, mentioning state-funded plans (going by the Italian piani di rinascita \\"rebirth plans\\"Art.13, Statuto speciale per la Sardegna: Lo Stato col concorso della Regione dispone un piano organico per favorire la rinascita economica e sociale dell'Isola.) for the heavy industrial development of the island. One hundred years had passed since the Perfect Fusion, when Sardinia became an autonomous region of Italy. However, the Statute upon which the autonomy was effectively based fell short of many Sardists' expectations. Upon viewing the draft of the Statute, Lussu's laconic comment was ¬´this autonomy might as well fit into the family of federalism like a cat into the lion's¬ª. The lawyer Gonario Pinna went as far as stating ¬´the form of autonomy being currently promulgated is far from providing the island with a serious and organic capacity of self-rule, but rather hollows out its fundamental principles and shall lead to harsh disappointments whenever translated into practice¬ª.Statuto Sardo commentato, Regione Autonoma della Sardegna, 1998, Arti Grafiche Pisano The Psd'Az suffered another serious split in July, when Lussu left and founded the short- lived Sardinian Socialist Action Party. The Sardist movement experienced a new wave of support at the end of the '60s, when the Sardinian society started becoming aware that its cultural heritage had been gradually vanishing; growing inequality was also being produced by a dual-economic structure, with the labour and resources being moved to the sector focused on the petrochemical industryLa Rivista il Mulino, La Sardegna, Manlio Brigaglia (particularly fostered by the PCI) and the Italian, NATO and U.S. military installations. By the '70s, Sardist claims were widespread with the support of many springing grassroots organisations;Le molte anime del mondo che sogna un'isola-nazione, Piero Mannironi - La Nuova Sardegna they ranged from supporting of the Sardinian Action Party to having harshly critical views towards it, and were also ideologically diverse: for example, the catholic Unione Democratiga pro s'Indipendentzia de sa Sardigna (\\"Democratic Union for Sardinian Independence\\") and the socialist Liga de Unidade Nazionale pro s'Indipendentzia de sa Sardigna e su Socialismu (\\"League of National Union for Sardinian Independence and Socialism\\"), competing with each other based on their beliefs, were both founded in 1967.Cultura e identitade - Sardinna, ghennalzu - aprile 2002 Some cultural circles, like Citt√†-Campagna and Su Populu Sardu, also drew militants from the extra-parliamentary groups based on the island, and saw many Sardinian university students joining in. The youth wings in the town of Orgosolo were particularly active against land dispossession and the militarization of the grazing lands. In 1978, the movement Sardenya y Llibertat (\\"Sardinia and Freedom\\") was founded by Carlo Sechi and Rafael Caria in the city of Alghero.Il cammino del mare di Alghero - Internazionale The Psd'Az experienced another comeback in the 1980s. In the 1984 regional election the party peaked at 30% in Cagliari and over 20% in Sassari and Oristano, gaining overall 13.8% of the vote: therefore, due to its pivotal role in the newly elected Regional Council, Sardist Mario Melis was President of Sardinia from 1984 to 1989,Regional Council of Sardinia when it managed to get 12,5% of the vote. Ever since, that result has not been repeated yet by the Sardinian Action Party, let alone any of the splinter groups emerging from it. The Sardinian nationalist movement is in fact rather disjointed and lacking in unity nowadays:Michela Murgia, la scrittrice si candida a guidare la Sardegna.

Adesso vogliamo la nostra indipendenza¬ª - L'Inkiesta all attempts to unify the nationalist subgroups have so far failed; thus, the Sardist movement still suffers from being highly fragmented into a large number of political subgroups pushing different policies. All the Sardist parties put together usually win around 10-20% of the vote in regional elections, with not a single one managing to emerge as a serious competitor to the statewide parties. Such disconnect between societal views and political capitalization is called by some scholars, like Pala, the \\"disorganic connection of the regionalist actors\\" (connessione disorganica degli attori regionalisti). Unlike other European regions with nationalist tendencies, even the local branches of statewide parties have incorporated regionalist elements in their political agenda,Pala, Carlo (2016). Idee di Sardegna. Autonomisti, sovranisti, indipendentisti oggi, Carocci editore, pp.152-156 thus undermining the once distinctive Sardist demands:Lluch, Jaime. Constitutionalism and the Politics of Accommodation in Multinational Democracies it is to be mentioned, for example, Francesco Cossiga's constitutional bill n. 352 to reform the Sardinian Statute, which ended up being eventually rejected by the Italian Parliament and aimed to recognize the island as a distinct nation within Italy, and to grant it the right to self-determination.DDL Costituzionale n. 352 sulla Costituzione della Comunit√† Autonoma di SardegnaIndipendenza della Sardegna: da Cossiga a Pili, obiettivo ricostruire i rapporti tra l‚Äôisola e la terraferma, L'Indro, Carlo Pala The nationalist parties have disjointedly responded to the long-term accommodation strategy promoted by the statewide ones: some refused to team up, while others tried to work with the pro-Italian parties as coalition partners, in the hopes of applying further pressure from within to favour increased devolution; either choice has been met with diffidence by the Sardinian electorate, leading the various Sardist parties to play a marginal role in Sardinian politics. In the 2014 regional election, for instance, more than a dozen Sardist parties of different connotations took part to the electoral competition, but yet again, because of their number and political fragmentation,Galassia sardista al 26 per cento - La Nuova SardegnaLa Babele del sardismo - SardiniapostIdea secessione, gli indipendentisti sardi: ¬´S√¨ al referendum, ma non ora¬ª - La Nuova SardegnaItalian centre-left wins Sardinian election, Murgia's pro-sovereignty coalition left outside Council - Nationalia.com they did not manage to win as many seats as they were initially supposed to, someSardegna Possibile non esiste!

The building was designed by architects Albert L. Harris & Arthur B. Heaton in the Colonial Revival style. It was dedicated on October 28, 1924 and named after William Wilson Corcoran, who was President of the Trustees and benefactor of the University. Nuclear physicist George Gamow both taught and did research in the building from 1934 to 1956. The bazooka was developed in the basement during World War II. The physics department is now housed in the building. ==Architecture== The Colonial Revival building is a four-story structure with a concrete and steel frame. The exterior is covered in red brick laid in Flemish bond and trimmed in limestone. The rectangular structure is wide and deep. The main entrance to the building is in the center of the main facade and is flanked by four segmental arched windows on each side. The upper stories are similarly symmetrical with rectangular windows. A simple cornice frames the top of the building. A cupola tops the structure. ==See also== *H.B.

The estate was founded in 1774 but the current main building was built in 1870 to a design by Henrik Steffens Sibbern. ==History== Rosenfeldt The estate was founded by Baron Reinhard von Iselin, a prosperous, Swiss-born landowner, who in 1774 acquired the land when the Crown sold Vordingborg Cavalry District in auction. From 1776 to 1777 he constructed a large farm complex around an octagonal courtyard with the assistance of the architect Christian Joseph Zuber. Iselin's daughter, Anna Elizabeth, inherited Rosenfeldt in 1781. In 1777 she had married the French-born nobleman Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette who in 1783 was appointed prefect of M√∏n where he owned Marienborg and founded the Liselund estate which he named after his wife. In 1844 the estate was acquired by captain, general-major Oscar O'Neill Oxholm. He lived on the estate with his Irish wife Adelaide Maria O¬¥Kelly. Oxholm constructed the new main building, two farm buildings and 20 f√¶steg√•rde. Designed by Henrik Steffens Sibbern, the main building was built from 1868 to 1870. ==Architecture== Rosenfeldt's buildings are arranged around seven of eight sides of Zuber's octagonal courtyard, a layout which is remniscient of that of Amalienborg in Copenhagen. Zuber's original farm complex consists of four low pavilions and two tall stable buildings in Neoclassical style. The plan also reserved a site for the main building which was not built until 1870. Sibbern's main building is constructed in red brick and designed in a Neo- Renaissance style. It consists of a two-story main wing with a tower flanked by two short lateral wings. ==Rosenfeldt Manor today== Rosenfeldt Manor is owned by Peter Oxholm Tillisch.

In this theory, heterosexuality is seen as able to be adopted by people regardless of their personal sexual orientation, heterosexuality is viewed as the natural state of both sexes, and deviation is seen as unfavorable. The term was popularized by Adrienne Rich in her 1980 essay titled \\"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\\". ==Concept and terminology== Adrienne Rich argued that heterosexuality is a political institution that supports the patriarchal domination of men over women in society, and feminist literature still functions under a heterosexual paradigm. She believes that feminist authors do not adequately acknowledge that institutions such as marriage are merely socializations that have been internalized and reproduced in society. This institution defines the standards for sexual and romantic relationships and alienates those outside of the standards. Compulsory heterosexuality is viewed as an institution ingrained in individuals from birth, and thus individuals are assumed to be heterosexual until proven otherwise. Due to this, Sandra Lipsitz Bem argues that sexual minorities have a greater \\"global identity development\\" from individuals investigating their experiences and senses of self in contrast to society. Individuals with minority sexual orientations are found to consider their sexual orientation as integral to their relationships with other people and as a foundation for their overall identity.Konik, Julie and Stewart, Abigail (18 June 2004). \\"Sexual Identity Development in the Context of Compulsory Heterosexuality.\\" Journal of Personality. 72, Issue 4: 815-844. == Factors ==  Manifestations of male power  The idea states that male dominance in a patriarchal society is a major factor in enforcing compulsory female heterosexuality; that, in order to serve men's needs, heterosexuality requires men to force women into heterosexual relationships and marriage under a patriarchal society. Kathleen Gough argues that there are eight characteristics of \\"male power in archaic and contemporary societies\\", which are: # Rejecting women's sexuality # Forcing male sexuality upon women # Exploiting women's labor # Controlling or robbing women of their children # Confining women physically # Using women as objects for male transactions # Denying women their creativity # Denying women from knowledge and cultural attainments These characteristics combined create a culture in which women are convinced that heterosexuality and heterosexual relationships are inevitable by \\"control of consciousness,\\" particularly when used in conjunction with lesbian erasure. Heterosexuality is used to make women dependent on men for their wants and needs. The Radicalesbians argued that homosexual orientations can only exist under a society in which male domination exists, and that for self-realization women must uplift each other rather than being complacent in oppression by men. Female heterosexuality may also exist under a guise of seeking access to power through men rather than sexual attraction, as male socialization conflates power and dominance with sexual attraction.  Lesbian erasure  Rich argues that compulsory heterosexuality keeps women subjugated under the patriarchy by not allowing for non-heterosexual, deviant sexuality to be explored, such as lesbian identities. She believes that there is a \\"lesbian continuum\\" of relationships, regardless of sexual desire within them, and that sexual choice is a necessity for female empowerment under male domination. There is also an exclusion of lesbian identities as a viable and natural option for women in feminist literature in Rich's time. She believes that feminist literature assumes that women are \\"innately sexually oriented\\" for heterosexuality and that lesbian identities are formed out of backlash towards men rather than a valid identity in itself, as well as feminist literature not adequately examining compulsory heterosexuality and whether or not women would choose heterosexuality if the society were not patriarchal. Lesbian erasure can also be considered a health care issue. As doctors assume that all patients are heterosexual, the answer to the question 'Are you sexually active?' is followed by questions about birth control methods and such heterosexual-oriented questions without considering that the sexual orientation of the female patient may not be heterosexual. A health care provider who is unaware of a patient's sexual orientation can lead to missing or improperly treating medical problems in non-heterosexual patients. It is suggested that women outside of standard relationships, such as lesbian and bisexual women, are best able to see the confines that heterosexuality imposes because they are not as adjusted to the inequality within heterosexual relationships, and that heterosexual women are confined to believing that heterosexuality is the only option.  Evolutionary theory  A major drive for compulsory heterosexuality is that of evolution, tying a sexual orientation's worth with reproduction. Evolutionarily speaking, in order to further the species, offspring must be created, and therefore genes are passed on. This basic understanding of biology is then taken steps further, implicating heterosexuality as the \\"natural\\" form and therefore making homosexuality specifically, as well as any minority sexuality, \\"abnormal\\". As Seidman puts it, science is \\"a powerful practical-moral force\\". Though evolutionary arguments have implications in minority sexualities, they also directly impact the stereotypes of heterosexual relationships and especially concepts of masculinity. Arguments for men being the hunter are then applied to today's understanding of the male gender being superior. The flip side of this understanding is the influence of this on the female gender, with them being depicted as the weaker sex and their main function being childbearing. These understandings however do not include ideas of morality, which is what is being applied to them.  Religion  Much of religion invokes a binary model for sexuality;Comstock, Gary David, and Susan E. Henking. Que(e)rying Religion: A Critical Anthology. New York: Continuum, 1997. Print. for example, the Bible's inclusion of Adam and Eve as the beginning of humanity. Other examples include specific texts such as this one from Leviticus, \\"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.\\"King James Bible, Leviticus 18:22 Religious institutions throughout history have had strict moral guidelines when it came to marriage and what is deemed acceptable in the eyes of God. This directly translates to compulsory heterosexuality in society through influence of leaders of the church, as well as in devout followers of this belief. Homosexuals have a difficult time finding acceptance, particularly in the Bible Belt: > \\"There's little doubt that discrimination against homosexuals is the last > \\"acceptable\\" form of discrimination. While most folks have outgrown overt > racist and sexist attacks, for many people it's still okay to take shots at > homosexuals. They are called names, blamed for society's problems, and often > humiliated because of their sexual preference.\\" While a binary model for sexuality might be enforced, \\"Many of the Puritans in colonial New England believed that all human beings were filled with homosexual as well as heterosexual desire and that the good Christian should direct that desire into procreative sex within marriage.\\"Endsj√∏, Dag √òlstein. Sex and Religion : Teachings and Taboos in the History of World Faiths. London, GB: Reaktion Books, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 7 March 2017. This ideology carries over in modern-day conservative Christianity, and is enforced through the idea that the more welcoming people are to the idea of homosexuality, the more people will give in to their homosexual lusts.  Sexism in the labor force  Rich argues for compulsory heterosexuality in the workplace, to which end she references Catharine MacKinnon's Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination. MacKinnon argues that women occupy low-paying jobs and their sexual marketability is a factor in the workplace. MacKinnon states that \\"her job depends on her pretending to be not merely heterosexual, but a heterosexual woman in terms of dressing and playing the feminine, deferential role required of 'real' women\\". Rich argues that the treatment of women in the workplace is a significant influence in society's compulsory heterosexuality. Rich argues that women feel pressure to be heterosexual in the workplace, and that this pressure is also present in society as a whole. As a species will become extinct if no reproduction occurs, and human women must be inseminated to produce offspring, heterosexual relationships are necessary for the survival of the human race, barring artificial insemination. According to Rich, women accept the male sex drive and regard themselves as sexual prey, and this influences compulsory heterosexuality. Furthermore, according to Rich, Barry argues for a \\"sexual domination perspective\\", claims that men subject women to what she terms as \\"sexual abuse\\" and \\"terrorism\\", and that the \\"sexual domination perspective\\" causes people to consider this \\"sexual abuse\\" and \\"terrorism\\" to be natural and inevitable and thus ignore it. According to Rich, women believe men have a natural need to have sex, and this results in them viewing \\"abuse\\" as inevitable. Barry argues that this rationale is romanticized through popular media. Rich claims that this is reinforced through compulsory heterosexuality. == In males == While the concept of compulsory heterosexuality initially only included women, later revisions of the idea have included discussion on how Compulsory Heterosexuality necessarily requires both men and women to reinforce the construct; ergo, that compulsory heterosexuality impacts males as well. Tolman, Spencer, Rosen-Reynoso, and Porche (2003) found that even heterosexual males reported being negatively impacted by compulsory heterosexuality through being groomed to aggressively pursue women and through the interactions that society allows them to have with other males. In another article, entitled \\"In a Different Position: Conceptualizing Female Adolescent Sexuality Development Within Compulsory Heterosexuality\\", Tolman uses the term hegemonic masculinity to describe the set of norms and behaviors that dominate the social development of males. Moreover, hegemonic masculinity mirrors Rich's construct of compulsory heterosexuality by pointing out the social intuitions that demand specific behaviors from males; she says, \\"these norms demand that men deny most emotions, save for anger; be hard at all times and in all ways; engage in objectification of women and sex itself; and participate in the continuum of violence against women\\". Compulsory heterosexuality also negatively affects gay and bisexual men by teaching them from a young age that straightness is \\"normal\\" and therefore anything that deviates from that is abnormal. Debbie Epstein discusses in her book, Silenced Sexualities in Schools and Universities, how heteronormative standards, as well as compulsory heterosexuality, lead not only to young males feeling forced to appear heterosexual, but can lead to violence against these males if they deviate from expectations against them.Epstein, Debbie, Sarah OFlynn, and David Telford. Silenced sexualities in schools and universities. Trentham Books, 2003. Hellen Lenskyj has further suggested in her article \\"Combating homophobia in sport and physical education\\" that heterosexuality is enforced in males through imitation and violence against those who deviate. Through these norms, males are taught from a young age that if they do not comply to heterosexual norms and standards they place themselves at risk for social exclusion and physical violence against them. == Intersectionality with other minority identities == To understand the complexity of compulsory heterosexuality, several scholars have pointed out the importance of the impact of this construct on the differential effects on all populations, including minorities. In \\"No More Secrets, No More Lies: African American History and Compulsory Heterosexuality\\", Mattie Udora Richardson discusses the additional complexities faced by Black women in terms of forced compulsory heterosexuality. Udora Richardon points out that, \\"Any divergences from the social norms of marriage, domesticity, and the nuclear family have brought serious accusations of savagery, pathology, and deviance upon Black people.\\" She argues that, as a group that is already stigmatized in multiple ways, Black women face additional pressures from both the Black and White communities towards heteronormativity. Divergences from heterosexuality place Black women in particular risk of physical harm or social exile. == Criticisms == Friction developed between members of the gay liberation and lesbian feminist movement due to the emphasis on sexual orientation politics through the lens of gender politics alone. Gay liberationists argued that the complexity of sexual orientation politics cannot be easily reduced to gender politics, and that women are denied rights while gay and lesbian individuals are denied existence. The theory of compulsory heterosexuality is criticized for upholding the existence of a binary gendered system and strict roles under this binary system. This criticism states that compulsory heterosexuality ignores individuals who act outside of their prescribed gender roles as well as ignoring individual agency in life. Institutions such as Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal believe that compulsory heterosexuality is upheld by individuals and organizations, not society-wide beliefs. Therefore, as lesbian and gay visibility increase, compulsory heterosexuality decreases. As individual freedoms for sexual minorities increase, the institution of heterosexuality disappears. == Influence == Rich believes that a woman is able to overcome compulsory heterosexuality by separating herself from men and entering a lesbian relationship to determine if heterosexuality is right for her. She argued that all women can be lesbians, regardless of sexual orientation, by identifying as a \\"woman-identified woman\\", meaning that the woman's focuses are on the needs and emotions of other women. The concept of compulsory heterosexuality and being able to reject this notion became a core component of the lesbian separatist movement that began in the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Compulsory heterosexuality is also seen as a precursor to the development of the theory of heteronormativity, with the difference being that compulsory heterosexuality emphasizes the regulation of sexual expression in individuals. ==See also== *Biphobia *Bisexual erasure *Heteronormativity *Heterosexism *Heterosociality *Liberal homophobia *Monosexism == References  *Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence, by Adrienne Rich *The Invention of Heterosexuality- Article by Louis-George Tin, Translated by Christopher E.

Lovecraft Historical Society. Based on the H. P. Lovecraft short story of the same name, it was shot using Mythoscope, a blend of vintage and modern filming techniques intended to produce the look of a 1930s-era film. According to the film's website, the filmmakers intended to capture the look of \\"classic horror films of the 1930s like Dracula, Frankenstein and King Kong\\".Official Site ==Plot== For the first two acts, the plot largely follows the short story. The third act consists of entirely new material in which the Mi-Go are revealed to worship Shub-Niggurath,and the protagonist, Wilmarth, uncovers an attempt by cultists to open a gateway between Yuggoth and Earth. He foils the plot with the help of Hannah, the child of one of the collaborators. His escape is unsuccessful and at the end of the film the audience discovers that Wilmarth has been narrating from a machine attached to the cylinder in which his brain now resides. This differs from the original story in which Wilmarth flees in the middle of the night and safely returns to Arkham. According to Sean Branney on the making-of featurette \\"The Whisperer Behind the Scenes,\\" Lovecraft was better at set-ups than endings. From a dramatic standpoint, Lovecraft's story brought the writers through what would be \\"Act Two\\" of a standard movie structure and felt incomplete. The character of Hannah and opening of gate to Yuggoth were introduced in order to \\"[make it] a good movie\\". Branney and Leman intended to make Wilmarth's world \\"more emotionally complicated\\" because Hannah's future caused him to be \\"invested in more than just himself\\". The characters of Wilmarth's three friends at Miskatonic University were developed from Call of Cthulhu role-playing characters created years before by Branney, Leman, and a friend. Regarding the introduction of a biplane, Leman commented, \\"If you have monsters that fly, you have to have a dogfight with a biplane.\\"The Whisperer in Darkness. Dir. Sean Branney. 2011. DVD.

On September 22, 1857, he served in the artillery of the Indian army. He left on 13 November from the Colonial Wharf Depot to Harderwijk with a detachment replacement troops. ==Expedition to Banjarmasin== The Royal Decree of 17 August 1859 promoted Borel to first lieutenant and commander of the expeditionary artillery. In the same year he began an expedition to the South and East Division of Borneo. After repeated defeats by the enemy, the war moved gradually to the north of the sultan's empire. By a slight gain of 4 officers, 162 man infantry and 20 artillerymen who arrived on September 28 from Surabaya, as commander it was now possible to apprehend insurgents in more remote areas. So when it became known that Antaloedin, leader of affairs north of the Allalak River, was going to Mata Raman in secrecy, a strongly armed Dutch garrison, composed of hundreds of bayonets, a howitzer and a hand mortar under the command of Captain Van Oijen prepared to engage Antaloedin. After a march of seven hours and many other complications, Van Oijen rushed into the battle the next day and took many casualties. In desperation, Borel and Lieutenant Perelaer threw themselves into the river, swam to the other side and shocked the enemy into withdrawing. The Dutch victory was crucial in the war effort and had breached many of Antaloedin's defensive positions. An uneasy peace was acquired, but the peace did not last as Demang Lehman tried to assassinate Colonel Andresen. Borel took part in the expedition until December 1860 and distinguished himself mainly during the conquest of Tjinta Puri on 21 October 1859. The target was surrounded by an almost impenetrable swamp, and an impassable river. Many soldiers were distinguished in this victory and Borel, by Royal Decree of February 18, 1861 was appointed knight of the Military Order of William. On Borels request he was allowed (October 1862) to return to the Netherlands. He departed on December 24 on the steamship Batavia. In The Netherlands he was assigned to the third regiment of fortress-artillery (15 September 1863). He was promoted to captain third class (by age of rank). ==Second expedition to Aceh== After the failed first expedition to Aceh, the government asked Borel to join the second expedition to Aceh, and thus for two years he joined the Indian army in Aceh. He was entrusted the leadership of the new siege. Borel arrived in Batavia on September 20, 1873 by steamship Prince of Orange (departed on 6 August) under his commands was a detachment of 18 NCOs, 288 troops and was assigned the leadership of the newly drawn exercises for the siege. ==Colonel Borel as governor of the Royal Military Academy== Borel returned to the Netherlands on June 11, 1875 and was placed at the second fortress-artillery regiment. He spoke in the meeting of the Royal Society for the Practice of Military Science on Wednesday, February 5, 1879 on the Indian brigade, its composition, armament and destination, and ended this speech with the words: Gentlemen, I end my speech with a sincere desire that the Indian brigade, as they have ever created could come, not only may serve to increase our resilience, but also to guarantee the more to the lasting and peaceful possession of our beautiful colonies, which Dutch growth and prosperity are so closely connected . The primary purpose of Borel in the deployment of that brigade was soon to make an end to the then rampant four years long Aceh War. ==Paper War== Two years after his return to the Netherlands Borel wrote a highly critical book about the politics held during the second Aceh expedition. Supreme Commander of the second expedition, General van Swieten, wrote his book, \\"The Truth about our branch in Aceh\\" following Borels book. Borel defended himself against accusations raised against him by Van Swieten, in his epilogue \\"Fallacies are not the truth\\" (1880). The flow of documents back and forth that followed the Second Aceh war, was called \\"the Paper War.\\" Borel's son, writer Henri Borel, wrote a critical work in 1878, \\"Our Office in Aceh,\\" where he harshly condoned the policies and tactics of General van Swieten which at that time caused a sensation in large military and colonial circles. It was an unprecedented act of courage at that time, a captain who was honestly not afraid to criticize his commanding general.

This effect is mostly seen and studied in educational and organizational environments. It is a form of self- fulfilling prophecy. ==Origin of the term== The effect is named after the golem, a clay creature that was given life by Rabbi Loew of Prague in Jewish mythology. According to the legend, the golem was originally created to protect the Jews of Prague; however, over time, the golem grew more and more corrupt to the point of spiraling violently out of control and had to be destroyed. The effect was named after the golem legend in 1982 by Babad, Inbar, and Rosenthal because it \\"represent[s] the concerns of social scientists and educators, which are focused on the negative effects of self- fulfilling prophecies\\". ==The effect== The Golem effect has very similar underlying principles to its theoretical counterpart, the Pygmalion effect. Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson's Pygmalion in the Classroom and further experiments have shown that expectations of supervisors or teachers affect the performance of their subordinates or students. The most thoroughly studied situations of this effect are classrooms. When arbitrarily informed that a particular student is \\"bright\\" or \\"dull\\", not only will the supervisor's behavior change to favor the \\"bright\\" students (as indicated by more praise or attention), the students themselves will exhibit behaviors in line with their labels (such as the \\"bright\\" students leaning more forward in their chairs relative to the \\"dull\\" students). While the Pygmalion effect and the majority of studies focus on the positive side of this phenomenon, the Golem effect is the negative corollary. Supervisors with negative expectations will produce behaviors that impair the performance of their subordinates while the subordinates themselves produce negative behaviors. This mechanism is an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy: the idea that self-held beliefs can come true in reality. When both supervisor and subordinate notice the low performance, the negative expectations are confirmed and the belief is reinforced. Up until Babad, Inbar, and Rosenthal, studies on teacher/supervisor expectancy and its effect on performance had primarily focused on the Pygmalion effect. Babad actually investigated the effect in his 1977 paper looking at developmentally challenged students but his 1982 paper is considered the seminal Golem effect article due to its more generalizable student population. As opposed to other past teacher-student expectancy studies, the authors asked their teachers to nominate three high-expectancy and three low-expectancy students out of each class instead of just high- expectancy nominations and a control group. In addition to replicating the findings of previous Pygmalion effect studies, the authors found support for the Golem effect. Teachers who were susceptible to biasing information treated their low-expectancy students more dogmatically than their high-expectancy students. Consequently, low-expectancy students performed worse than their high-expectancy counterparts. Teachers who were not susceptible to bias did not show any distinctions in behavior between high and low-expectancy students. Although the majority of research looking at the Golem effect has focused on educational contexts, the effect has also been studied in the workplace. A study by Schrank that predated the Rosenthal and Jacobson article looked at US Air Force Academy airmen. The author induced a \\"labeling effect\\" by randomly assigning incoming freshmen to one of five class sections supposedly designating ability levels. McNatt performed a meta-analysis on studies with workplace samples and found that the Golem (and Pygmalion) effects still hold true to around the same magnitude at the workplace as they do in the classroom. Furthermore, the Golem effect can influence entire organizations, not just supervisors and their direct subordinates. Absolute and relative Davidson and Eden suggested there are two different types of Golem effects: absolute and relative. The absolute Golem effect occurs when the individuals who are identified as the low tier of their group are in fact underqualified for their group. For any given normal distribution of students or employees, this may be the case; there will be some individuals who do not meet the performance standards of the group. However, the more potentially dangerous type of effect is the relative Golem effect. In this case, the entire population is qualified to be in the group. However, because there will always be a \\"lower tier\\" even for a group of individuals who meet all of the performance standards of the group, the Golem effect could potentially degrade the performance of even highly skilled individuals. Davidson and Eden suggested a number of \\"de-Golemization\\" efforts such as convincing the group that the initial performance measures underestimate true potential in order to reduce this threat. ==Psychological mechanisms== Although the consequences of the Pygmalion/Golem effects are well documented, the mechanisms behind them are more disputed among researchers. Both effects have been argued to stem from Victor Vroom's expectancy theory. This theory posits that people are more likely to perform behaviors that they believe they have a high expectation of performing successfully. In relation to the Golem effect, when expectations are set low by the supervisor, subordinates do not require as much effort to successfully reach their performance expectation, which consequently results in lower performance. Rowe and O'Brian argued that the Golem effect was a result of transaction cost and agency theories. They posit that because teachers monitor their classes for opportunistic behaviors, some students may take such monitoring as a sign that the teacher does not trust them and, in turn, engage in opportunistic behavior because it is expected of them. Although there have been proposed models of self-fulfilling prophecies including the Pygmalion/Golem effect, no model has been empirically tested. This lack of research is especially glaring considering the golem effect is heavily involved with other established motivational theories and organizational behavior concepts such as self-efficacy, leader-member exchange, and transformational leadership. ==Methodological issues== There is currently a relative paucity of research that directly addresses Golem effects, and an even lesser body that measures and examines it. There are a multitude of reasons cited for this scarcity, but the most common reason involves the ethical concerns raised in examining negative and potentially harmful phenomenon. Specifically, the concern arises in trying to operationalize negative expectancies in individuals, which will theoretically result in their lower performance. The worry then is the possible harmful, lingering effects on research participants beyond the study due to this manipulation. These effects could originate either from the participant having the knowledge that they performed worse than others, were unwittingly manipulated to perform worse, or were viewed negatively by a superior in the research paradigm; on the other hand, participants in a position of superiority that were manipulated to have negative expectancies may feel guilty about treating others differently following the experiment. Whatever the exact effect may be, these concerns have resulted in many researchers only making passive mention of the Golem effect in studies or ignoring it entirely. However, there is reason to believe that the apprehension towards conducting Golem studies may not be entirely well founded, as evidenced by several studies that have successfully set out to measure the effect explicitly. For example, Feldman & Prohaska used confederate subordinates to elicit negative expectations from subjects acting as students or teachers; in doing so, the ethical concerns of subjects having to be direct \\"victims\\" of the Golem effect were avoided. Oz & Eden designed a study in which military squad leaders were differentiated by treatment and control conditions. In the treatment condition, squad leaders' perceptions were manipulated as to believe that low scores on a physical fitness test were not indicative of a subordinate's ineptitude, whereas the control condition involved no manipulation. Thus, the Golem effect was measured indirectly through theoretically creating a \\"buffer\\" from the effect in the treatment condition. In this manner, the experimenters never actually created the Golem effect in their participants; rather, they measured a naturally occurring Golem effect in comparison to a \\"Golem treatment\\" group. There is evidence that even studies that directly generate and measure Golem effects in participants are still very viable and can be passed by ethics boards and other regulatory bodies. Reynolds designed a study in which support instructors for an introductory management course were led to believe they were assigned either lower-performing or higher-performing students based on a pretest, although the actual assignment was completely random and arbitrary. He was able to demonstrate the Golem effect from this manipulation on a posttest (in which the \\"lower-performing\\" students actually performed worse, and the \\"higher-performing students\\" performed better), showing that it is very feasible to design studies that measure the effect in a more direct and controlled fashion without being shut down by regulatory bodies. However, studies such as this are regrettably still extremely scarce in current Golem research. ==Pygmalion effect== :See also Pygmalion effect Compared to the Golem effect, the Pygmalion effect enjoys a far greater body of literature; this is most likely due to the fact that this research is free from the ethical challenges of examining Golem effects. More specific and involved discussion of the Pygmalion effect is beyond the scope of this article, but several recent studies on this effect are worth mentioning in regards to their implications for the Golem effect and future research. Although the Pygmalion effect has been studied in great detail using experimental and quasi-experimental designs, due to the methodological issues surrounding the Golem effect, most of the conclusions drawn on the Golem effect have been from correlational data from Pygmalion studies. Cross- cultural effects Recent research has explored the Pygmalion effect in cultural settings not previously studied. For example, a recent study examined how Japanese humanitarian aid workers stationed in different countries across the world perceived and interacted with the local organizations that they consulted with. The researchers found support for the notion that when the aid workers held more positive perceptions of their local colleagues, higher levels of organizational performance were observed. Such findings raise the question of whether Golem effects would also be observed in such multicultural settings and provides ample opportunity for future research inquiry. Golem in reverse Many modern organizations are starting to face a new challenge in superior/subordinate relationships: the older employee reporting to a younger supervisor. This particular situation is expected to occur more and more as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age. As such, there is great opportunity for research in examining the effects of older employees' expectations and perceptions of younger supervisors, a phenomenon that has been labeled as Reverse Pygmalion. A reverse Pygmalion effect is not synonymous with the Golem effect. In both the regular Pygmalion and Golem effects, the expectations of the supervisor have an effect on the performance of the subordinate while in the reverse Pygmalion and Golem effects, the expectations of the subordinate have an effect on the performance of the supervisor. To date, there has been little research on the subject; however, one study found that, compared to younger workers, older workers with younger supervisors expected less out of their supervisors, and consequently rated their leadership behaviors as lower than in other conditions. While this study refers to the effect studied as Reverse Pygmalion, it appears to be also lending credence to the possibility of a Reverse Golem effect existing, in that subordinates' negative expectations of supervisors may consequently influence supervisor behavior in a negative fashion. This would be an example of the \\"reverse\\" phenomenon due to the fact that the typical Golem effect runs in the direction of supervisor's expectation down to subordinates' behavior. However, more research is clearly needed to fully and rigorously test such speculation. Golem in group settings Lastly, there have been concerns raised about the Pygmalion effect possibly being an artifact of interpersonal contrast effects; by experimentally focusing high expectations on a treatment group, the control group (which typically receives no manipulation in Pygmalion studies) naturally is perceived with lower expectations. As such, the perceived difference between individuals becomes the driving force instead of high expectations alone. However, Eden demonstrated that this concern was not supported through manipulating entire groups (in this case, separate military squads randomly receiving Pygmalion versus control status); he found that the Pygmalion effect was still observed beyond the scope of any contrast effects as evidenced by higher mean performances of groups with leaders that received Pygmalion manipulation when compared to controls. It would be of significant value to the Golem research literature to see whether Golem effects are also unaffected by interpersonal contrast effects through similar group study designs. ==Implications== The Golem effect has many implications for various organizational settings, from schools to sports to multimillion- dollar corporations. Public education systems are likely to be very familiar with Golem effects in the form of controversy surrounding tracking systems, which have been almost completely abandoned in education today due to their inefficacy and detrimental effects. While tracking systems varied widely from school to school, the message conveyed to many students placed in remedial tracks was that of low expectations, which, in line with Golem research, led to poorer performance and behaviors. There is also great relevance for the Golem effect in sports, where a coach (a superior) must frequently gauge his or her outward displays of expectations towards individual teammates (the subordinate) in order to ensure that he/she is not sending negative messages. Such negative messages have the possibility to affect players' performance significantly. As such, it is far more ideal for coaches to engender high expectations towards all team members in order to harness the power of the Pygmalion effect. Finally, there is something to be said about Golem effects towards disenfranchised and stigmatized demographics in society such as the homeless, intellectually disabled, and other groups often looked down upon. Due to the low expectations often cast upon individuals in these groups by society as a whole, there is reason to believe that such individuals suffer from Golem effects in a truly significant and crippling manner. However, there is great hope for such trends to be stopped or even reversed, as evidenced by multiple government and non-profit programs aimed at recognizing and empowering these individuals to succeed in the modern workforce. ==See also== *David Moyes *Educational psychology *Industrial and organizational psychology *Pygmalion effect - opposite of the Golem effect *Self-fulfilling prophecy *Stereotype threat == References == Category:Attitude attribution Category:Golem ","title":"Golem effect"},{"id":"35176479","text":"Southern Rock Masters is a cover album by American southern rock band Molly Hatchet, was released on April 15, 2008 (see 2008 in music). ==Track listing Personnel == ;Molly Hatchet *Phil McCormack ‚Äì lead and backing vocals *Bobby Ingram ‚Äì guitars, acoustic guitar, slide guitar, backing vocals, producer, mixing *Dave Hlubek ‚Äì guitars *John Galvin ‚Äì keyboards, backing vocals *Tim Lindsey ‚Äì bass, backing vocals *Shawn Beamer ‚Äì drums, percussion ;Additional musicians *Charlie Daniels ‚Äì lead vocals on \\"Free Bird\\" ;Production *Paul Lapinski ‚Äì engineer, mixing, mastering *Scott Fravala, Daryl Pheeneger ‚Äì engineers ==References== Category:Molly Hatchet albums Category:2008 compilation albums Category:Covers albums Category:Cleopatra Records albums ","title":"Southern Rock Masters"},{"id":"35176514","text":"Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Hall (formerly known as Milton Hall) is a residence hall on the campus of the George Washington University, in Washington, DC.

The building is similar in style as the neighboring Munson Hall. It is eight stories tall, and features two bays. The exterior is faced with buff brick. The main entrance is in the recessed space between the two bays. Cast stone scrollwork is found over the door and surrounding the first floor and eighth floor windows. There are three medallions on each bay along a horizontal cast stone band above the sixth floor. In 1995 the building was named for Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, who graduated from GW in 1951.

Sometimes it is called by the make or model name like E6B, CR, CRP-5 or in German, as the Dreieckrechner. They are mostly used in flight training, but many professional pilots still carry and use flight computers. They are used during flight planning (on the ground before takeoff) to aid in calculating fuel burn, wind correction, time en route, and other items. In the air, the flight computer can be used to calculate ground speed, estimated fuel burn and updated estimated time of arrival. The back is designed for wind correction calculations, i.e., determining how much the wind is affecting one's speed and course. (Electronic option is available and can be used on FAA exams but pilots are still expected to know how to use the analog version.) One of the most useful parts of the E6B, is the technique of finding distance over time. Take the number 60 on the inner circle which usually has an arrow, and sometimes says rate on it. 60 is used in reference to the number of minutes in an hour, by placing the 60 on the airspeed in knots, on the outer ring you can find how far you will travel in any given number of minutes. Looking at the inner ring for minutes traveled and the distance traveled will be above it on the outer ring. This can also be done backwards to find the amount of time it will take to travel a given number of nautical miles. On the main body of the flight computer you will find the wind component grid, which you will use to find how much crosswind you will actually have to correct for. The crosswind component is the amount of crosswind in knots that is being applied to the airframe and can be less than the actual speed of the wind because of the angle. Below that you will find a grid called crosswind correction, this grid shows you the difference you need to correct for because of wind. On either side of the front you will have rulers, one for statue miles and one for nautical miles on your sectional map. Another very useful part is the conversion scale on the front outer circle, which helps convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The back of the E6B is used to find ground speed and determine how much wind correction you need. == Gallery == IAS,RAS,CAS to TAS airspeed conversion.pngCAS-TAS conversion StudentE6BFlightComputer.jpgAn E6B flight computer commonly used by student pilots.

After studying mathematics and logic at the University of Neuch√¢tel (Switzerland) and Bowling Green University (Ohio, United States), Denis Mi√©ville developed an interest in the development and formalization of natural logic that led him to study both the theory of collective classes and the foundations of maximal predicates in propositional logic. These interests were integrated in the doctoral thesis that he defended in 1984 (\\"A Development of Stanislaw Lesniewski's logical systems: Protothetic, ontology and mereology\\") at the University of Neuch√¢tel, supervised by the eminent logician Jean-Blaise Grize. Appointed Professor at the University of Neuch√¢tel in 1987 (he will become its rector from 1999 to 2003), he taught logic and chaired the Semiologic Research Centre. Professor Mi√©ville has taught at various institutions such as the University of Geneva, the University of Rennes in France and the University of Iasi in Romania. The University of Iasi awarded him a degree Honoris causa in 2003. He also received the Honorary Certificate of the Francophony in 2001. ==Research interests== Professor Mi√©ville developed an expertise on Lesniewski's logic due to his interest in developmental systems, that have the advantage of being dynamic, universal, free and of a higher order. Moreover, by developing a theory of syntactic- semantic categories, he focussed on a methodology able to identify logico- discursive indices in texts, by representing them as argumentative and reasoned structures. His interests became more and more inclined towards understanding the way in which discursive thought creates meaning, by inscribing it into reasoning networks. This is one of the reasons that led Professor Mi√©ville to specifically examine the discursive procedures from which new knowledge is developed, such as those proceeding by analogy, and those structuring creative definitions. Very sensitive to the epistemological dimension of knowledge, he has been interested in how concepts develop gradually and crystallize into stable entities. ==Publications== Books * Introduction √† l'≈ìuvre de S.

Green Oaks Boulevard creates a loop around Arlington, traveling north from State Highway 360 (SH 360) north, back to SH 360\\\\. The highway is the only loop in the city of Arlington. The road gives citizens of Arlington access to SH 360, Interstate 20 (I-20), and I-30, as well as several smaller state-designated highways. The street gives access to several schools and parks, as well as Arlington Municipal Airport. ==Route description== Green Oaks Boulevard begins at Texas State Highway 360's 2nd to last free exit before turning into a toll road, and the western end of Kingswood Boulevard, located in Grand Prairie, just a few feet from border of Arlington and Grand Prairie. The highway begins as a four-lane, concrete road, with a large, grassy median separating each direction. The road passes several small \\"strip malls\\", and several gas stations. The highway is known as Southeast Green Oaks Boulevard at this point, but is usually abbreviated to just SE Green Oaks Boulevard (This is shown on the exit from SH 360). The highway passes a small park, and a large neighborhood, before intersecting with New York Avenue, and passing a small animal hospital, and several small restaurants. The route continues with large neighborhoods on either side of it, before intersecting with South Collins Street, which gives access to the one-runway, Arlington Municipal Airport. Green Oaks passes through a park for a short period of time, before passing the Arlington Animal Shelter, and the Arlington Public Library-Southeast Branch. The roadway continues through a large neighborhood, and passes the Ferguson Junior High School. The road passes through a few large neighborhoods, before intersecting with Matlock Road, and passing several fast food restaurants, and a large baptist church. At this point it becomes Southwest Green Oaks Boulevard, and continues in a westerly direction. It intersects Farm to Market Road 157 at South Cooper Street, then curves northwestward to cross Interstate 20 after a couple more miles. Here it becomes West Green Oaks Boulevard, and it curves to the north, staying about a half mile east of the shore of Lake Arlington. It then crosses Texas State Highway Spur 303 and Texas State Highway 180 (former US 80) in quick succession, having an intersection with the former and an interchange with the latter. Just on the south side of the interchange with SH 180 are a set of rail tracks that form a border with Fort Worth, such that when Green Oaks Boulevard crosses them, it changes cities and names. The street continues in eastern Ft Worth as Dottie Lynn Parkway, then Eastchase Parkway, and Meadowbrook Boulevard, before finally crossing back into Arlington and becoming Northwest Green Oaks Boulevard at Randol Mill Road. Immediately after this intersection, the road crosses under Interstate 30 without an interchange, due to the nearby Eastchase Parkway already doing so. It then goes through a few curves, but maintains a generally eastward direction from here. It forms the northern terminus for various streets in Arlington including Fielder, Davis, and Cooper, at which point it finally becomes Northeast Green Oaks Boulevard. A mile farther east, it crosses Farm to Market Road 157 again, this time being carried on North Collins Street. It then dips to the southeast to meet the northern end of Ballpark Way, which can take traffic to Globe Life Park, then comes back northeast, and levels out due east again, crossing Holly Brook, Arlington's city limit for a final time a few dozen yards past this, then terminating at Texas State Highway 360 again. The roadway keeps going to the east and then south as Carrier Parkway in Grand Prairie, which itself terminates almost exactly far south as the extent of the firstly described southern leg above, at West Camp Wisdom Road that is known as Sublett Road in Arlington. ==History== Green Oaks Boulevard has been the site for several deadly automobile accidents, due to the road's high speed limit. A series of three major accidents during a short period of time in the fall of 2011. The first of the crashes occurred on August 11, 2011, when a wrong way driver collided with an 18-wheeler gas truck, and caused a large fuel spill at an intersection with the I-20 feeder road, that closed a portion of I-20 for several hours. On April 3, 2012, a large tornado hit Green Oaks Boulevard, and caused a large portion of the Green Oaks Nursing Home to collapse, with one person hospitalized due to injuries. ==References== Category:Transportation in Tarrant County, Texas ","title":"Green Oaks Boulevard"},{"id":"35176647","text":"Gasp√©-Nord was a former provincial electoral district in the Gasp√©sie area of Quebec, Canada.

While physical badges have been in use for hundreds of years, the idea of digital badges is a relatively recent development drawn from research into gamification. As game elements, badges have been used by organizations such as Foursquare and Huffington Post to reward users for accomplishing certain tasks. . In 2005, Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 Gamerscore system, which is considered to be the original implementation of an achievement system. According to Shields & Chugh (2017, pg 1817), digital badges are quickly becoming an appropriate, easy and efficient way for educators, community groups and other professional organisations to exhibit and reward participants for skills obtained in professional development or formal and informal learning\\".Shields, R. & Chugh, R, 2017, ‚ÄòDigital badges ‚Äì rewards for learning?‚Äô, Education and Information Technologies, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 1817‚Äì1824, doi: 10.1007/s10639-016-9521-x In 2007, Eva Baker, the President of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), gave the Presidential Address at their annual conference on the need to develop merit-badge-like \\"Qualifications\\" that certify accomplishments, not through standardized tests, but as \\"an integrated experience with performance requirements.\\" Such a system would apply to learning both in and out of school and support youth to develop and pursue passionate interests. Baker envisioned youth assembling \\"their unique Qualifications to show to their families, to adults in university and workforce, and to themselves.\\" Ultimately, Baker believed \\"the path of Qualifications shifts attention from schoolwork to usable and compelling skills, from school life to real life.\\" In early 2010, the digital badge service provider Basno launched a platform that allowed users to create and collect badges that represent real-world accomplishments like running the 2011 ING New York City Marathon. The effort marked a strong shift from viewing badges as game-like elements to creating badges to certify learning. Many instructional sites such as P2PU and Khan Academy make use of a digital badging system. In September 2011, US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, announced the launch of the HASTAC/MacArthur Foundation Badges for Lifelong Learning Competition. According to Arne Duncan, badges \\"can help engage students in learning and broaden the avenues for all learners or all ages, to acquire and to demonstrate as well as document and display their skills. Badges can help speed the shift from credentials that simply measure seat time to ones that more accurately measure competency, and we must do everything we can to accelerate that transition. It can also help to account for both formal and informal learning and in a variety of different settings.\\" Funded by the MacArthur Foundation, with additional support from the Gates Foundation, HASTAC administers the Badges for Lifelong Learning Competition, which awarded funds to thirty organizations in March 2012.\\"Badges For Lifelong Learning Competition Winners Announced\\".  Open Badge standard  The use of digital badges as credentials remained largely under the radar until 2011, following the release of \\"An Open Badge System Framework,\\" a white paper authored by Peer 2 Peer University and The Mozilla Foundation. In the paper, badges are explained as \\"a symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality or interest,\\" with examples of badge systems used by the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, PADI diving instruction, and the more recently popular geo- locative games, like Foursquare. The report asserts that badges \\"have been successfully used to set goals, motivate behaviors, represent achievements and communicate success in many contexts\\" and proposes that when learning happens across various contexts and experiences, \\"badges can have a significant impact, and can be used to motivate learning, signify community and signal achievement.\\" The report also makes clear that the value of badges comes less from its visual representation than from the context around how and why it was conferred. The stronger the connection between the two, the more effective the badging system will be. \\"Badges are conversation starters,\\" the report explains, \\"and the information linked to or 'behind' each badge serves as justification and even validation of the badge.\\" For example, a badge should include information about how it was earned, who issued it, the date of issue, and, ideally, a link back to some form of artifact relating to the work behind the badge. Later in 2011, the Mozilla Foundation announced their plan to develop an open technical standard called Open Badges to create and build a common system for the issuance, collection, and display of digital badges on multiple instructional sites. To launch the Open Badges project, Mozilla and MacArthur engaged with over 300 nonprofit organizations, government agencies and others about informal learning, breaking down education monopolies and fuelling individual motivation. Much of this work was guided by \\"Open Badges for Lifelong Learning,\\" an early working paper created by Mozilla and the MacArthur Foundation. In 2012, Mozilla launched Open Badges 1.0 and partnered with the City of Chicago to launch The Chicago Summer of Learning (CSOL), a badges initiative to keep local youth aged four to 24 active and engaged during the summer. Institutions and organizations like Purdue University, MOUSE and the U.K.-based DigitalME adopted badges, and Mozilla saw international interest in badging programs from Australia and Italy to China and Scotland. By 2013, over 1,450 organizations were issuing Open Badges and Mozilla's partnership with Chicago had grown into the Cities of Learning Initiative, an opportunity to apply CSOL's success across the country. In 2014, Mozilla launched the Badge Alliance, a network of organizations and individuals committed to building the open badging ecosystem and advancing the Open Badges specification. Founding members include Mozilla, the MacArthur Foundation, DigitalME, Sprout Fund, National Writing Project, Blackboard and others. More than 650 organizations from six continents signed up through the Badge Alliance to contribute to the Open Badges ecosystem. In 2015, the Badge Alliance spun out of Mozilla and became a part of MacArthur Foundation spin off, Collective Shift - a nonprofit devoted to redesigning social systems for a connected world. Later that year, Collective Shift partnered with Concentric Sky to develop Open Badges 2.0. That same year, Concentric Sky launched the open source project Badgr to serve as a reference implementation for Open Badges. In early 2016, IMS Global announced their commitment to Open Badges as an inter-operable standard for digital credentials, and in late 2016, Mozilla announced that stewardship of the Open Badges standard would transition officially to IMS Global. In late 2018, Mozilla announced that it would retire the Mozilla Backpack (see below) and migrate all users to Badgr. == Functions == Just as badges in the physical world serve many functions, digital badges are employed in a variety of ways. Badges can serve different functions depending on the activities with which they are associated. Commonly, badges are thought of as rewards but have been found to be most effective when they also contribute to goal setting, reputation, status affirmation, instruction and group identification. Badges also promote lifelong learning that extends beyond the classroom and brings to light accomplishments that otherwise might have been hidden.. Digital badges are associated with the gamification of learning, whereby game design and game mechanics are used in non-game contexts to encourage learning. Gibbons (2020) identified 13 roles for digital open badges in a higher education setting. Benefits associated with digital badges include the ability to capture the complete learning path, so it \\"travels\\" with the user wherever they decide to display the badge. The digital badge carries with it information about assessment, evidence and other metadata required by the badge. Digital badges can signal achievement to potential employers; motivate engagement and collaboration; improve retention and levelling up in learning; support innovation and flexibility in the skills that matter; and build and formalize identity and reputation within learning communities. Some digital badge platforms allow organizations to create, issue, earn and display digital badges on members' websites, social media pages, and resumes.  Motivation to participate  One of the ways in which badges are often used is to encourage participation by recognizing the participants. Motivation is often one of the major reasons designers decide to employ badges. Participation is encouraged because badges offer a new pathway of lifelong learning separate from the traditional, formalized academic pathway. Badges highlight and recognize skills and knowledge that come from personal initiative and investigation. When TripAdvisor started showing badges on user pages, they explicitly indicated that this was to recognize the most frequent contributors. Systems that have been successful at motivating people with badges cite their ability to intrinsically motivate participants by showcasing challenges overcome, displaying pathways for learning, and improving social connections. In 2016, IBM used Open Badges to launch a world- wide training initiative and saw dramatic increases in employee participation.  Motivation to collaborate  Unlike most online media, open badge programs are collaborative ones that promote active, engaged involvement. While there are several modes of online collective action, all of the systems are largely run by a very small number of people; \\"for example, just two percent of Wikipedia users account for 75% of participation\\". Given more collaboration by an increased number of people, even more solutions, ideas and theories could be presented and analyzed. Badges have the potential to work for any company or online collaborative action system in order to engage more people and motivate those people to participate in online data sharing and social media. Badges \\"enhance identity and reputation, raising profiles within learning communities and among peers by aggregating identities across other communities... [and] build community and social capital by helping learners find peers and mentors with similar interests. Community badges help formalize camaraderie, team synthesis, and communities of practice\\". Badges quantify the soft skills of teamwork that are pivotal to success in many professions today. Open Badges are used by organizations such as OER Commons to spur collaboration and resource sharing in their communities.  Recognition and assessment  Sometimes digital badges are used to recognize quality or provide for community approval. The \\"Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval\\" provides this in non-digital formats, but there are similar indicators of trust, for example, that indicate best practices in e-commerce. Sometimes such badges are indicators of awards, like the Webbies or Edublog Awards. Open Badges differ from more basic digital badges in that they allow an earner to represent, verify, and communicate their skills, interests and achievements across a wide array of learning systems. In learning environments, badges have been used to encourage alternative, peer-based assessment. Badges can be associated with summative assessments of prior learning as well as formative assessment that provide guidance and feedback. They can also function as transformative assessment that shape existing learning or allow new ones to be created. Digital badges might be particularly useful as part of a formative assessment process, providing constant feedback and tracking of what has been learned and what the next step might be. Massive online open courses (MOOCs) and e-assessments,Mora, M.C. et al. (2012), p. 734 can be used to deliver content at scale, while providing structured points for formative assessment, connections to learning communities, and new possibilities for strengthening individual agency in the learning process. Such environments might leverage self- and peer-assessment, again as part of formative processes. A drawback is that these types of assessment take time.Kelly-Riley, D. (2007), p. 30 However, strategies like peer review, interactive games or simulations, and self-administered tests might help in fragmenting assessment processes, while still providing essential feedback to the learner along the way. Also, as markers or benchmarks of learning, it is possible that digital badges might work particularly well for individuals who are stressed by testing, and for educators looking for mechanisms to accommodate differentiated learning pathways.  Implementation of Digital Badges  A double-loop learning process for the implementation of digital badges is recommended (Shields & Chugh, 2017).Shields, R. & Chugh, R, 2017, ‚ÄòDigital badges ‚Äì rewards for learning?‚Äô, Education and Information Technologies, vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 1817‚Äì1824, doi: 10.1007/s10639-016-9521-x Inclusion of range of stakeholders at the design, implementation and review stages is recommended. Double-loop learning process with digital badges (Shields & Chugh, 2017, pg 1822  Alternative credentials  Digital badges are seen as a potential challenger to the dominant paradigm of diplomas in higher education. The Chronicle of Higher Education notes that more and more online educational websites are adopting badges to mark achievement.\\"Digital Education Badges\\". With two- thirds of U.S. college or university students falling into the non-traditional category (meaning they aren't first-time, first-year students arriving on campus straight from high school), non-degree certificate programs will play an increasing role in providing post-secondary education opportunities. One website utilizing badges for alternative credentials is Badges for Vets. It is a free website funded by the HASTAC/MacArthur that provides U.S. military veterans with a means to use Open Badges to indicate relevant military training and experience to prospective employers. Examples of available badges include translator, engineering construction, law enforcement and finance, and employers are able to browse the Badges for Vets database to match specific qualifications or find qualified veterans in their local community.  Representations of competencies  Digital badges can also be used as competency-based signifier of achievement, which is in contrast to traditional educational models that stress time-based quantification of education goals. Digital badges also have the ability to be more nimble than school curriculum that take time to create, change, and evolve. Pearson Education, an early adopter of the Open Badges standard, cites a number of advantages to using badges to represent competencies, including the subjectivity of grades and the lack of transparency and granularity in traditional diplomas. == Aggregation and exchange == alt=Showing a user's group of badges from the Mozilla Backpack. Mozilla originally made available a service called the Mozilla Backpack that allowed users to aggregate and display their open badges. In late 2018, Mozilla announced that it would retire the Mozilla Backpack and migrate all users to Badgr. Prior to that, several attempts had been made to aggregate digital badges found on multiple sites. == Criticism == There have been criticisms of the use of badges, suggesting that the functions described above come with significant risks. Some claim that the long history of physical badges in military and quasi-military settings might encourage similar hierarchical relationships when employed online. (draft version). Badges have been criticized for rewarding tasks that are not inherently interesting to badge recipients because they are created to promote behavior that aligns with the goals of the badge issuer and not necessarily the badge recipient. Some critics have also observed that badges are a type of extrinsic motivator that could compete with an individual's intrinsic motivation for accomplishment and mastery. In other words, it is like giving out rewards for things that individuals or students should already be doing. Like with any system of rewards, it overall reduces students' motivation when the reward no longer becomes desirable. One of the biggest criticisms of badges is their validity, and whether they can be viewed as \\"trusted credentials.\\" Another criticism of digital badges is that the badge earner's performance is not directly observed so there could be some difficulty in making sure that the badge is awarded to the person who completed the assignment or met the specific criteria. Open Badges attempt to address these concerns by including the earner's email address in the badge and proving a verifiable link back to the issuer. The \\"gamification\\" of education is also something that skeptics fear because they feel that students would only be concerned with earning the most badges rather than focusing on the material presented. Additionally, there could be a slew of badges that do not mean anything at all, for example, like earning a badge because your name starts with the letter A. The creation of these \\"meaningless\\" badges reinforces the issue of validity because now the badge earner needs to decipher which badges are valuable, and various institutions need to do the same. ==See also== * Microdegree == References  External links == * * Open Badge Passport * MozillaWiki on Open Badges (Historical) * Chicago City of Learning Project * Badge Maker Category:Internet culture Category:Computer icons ","title":"Digital badge"},{"id":"35176757","text":"Scientific Computer Applications Inc.

Nottoway is closely related to Tuscarora within the Iroquoian language family. Two tribes of Nottoway are recognized by the state of Virginia: the Nottoway Indian Tribe of Virginia and the Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe. Other Nottoway descendants live in Wisconsin and Canada, where some of their ancestors fled in the 18th century. The last known speaker, Edith Turner, died in 1838. The Nottoway people are undertaking work for language revival. Knowledge of Nottoway comes primarily from a word list collected on March 4, 1820. Former President Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs handwritten letter to Peter S. Du Ponceau, on July 7, 1820, states that a Nottoway Indian vocabulary was obtained on March 4th, 1820 from Edith Turner, styled as their ‚ÄúQueen,‚Äù by John Wood, a former Professor of Mathematics at the College of William and Mary.Thomas Jefferson to Peter S. Du Ponceau, July 7, 1820 Du Ponceau recognized the language immediately as Iroquoian, writing that he was \\"struck as well as astonished at its decided Iroquois Physiognomy.\\"Peter S. DuPonceau to Thomas Jefferson, July 12, 1820, The Thomas Jefferson Papers, Series 1, The Library of Congress. Blair A. Rudes (1981) concluded that Nottoway is a distinct language from Tuscarora, but closest to Tuscarora within Iroquoian. In addition to the vocabulary collected by John Wood, a few additional words were gathered by James Trezvant.Encyclopedia Virginia Pre- contact distribution of the Nottoway language == Phonology ==  Vowels  By comparing words in Wood‚Äôs vocabulary with cognates in other Iroquoian languages, Blair Rudes (1981) was able to reconstruct the phonemes of Nottoway. According to Rudes (1981: 46), Nottoway has five vowel phonemes as seen in the following table. These symbols, which Rudes uses in his transcriptions, are consistent with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Note that the mid central vowel is nasalized. {   Front Central Back - High i   - Mid e …ôÃÉ o - Low  a  } Examples of these vowels are shown in the following table (from the Wood vocabulary as cited in Rudes 1981: 31). Wood's spelling of Nottoway was based on English and was therefore not systematic. A comparison to Tuscarora cognates in the rightmost column, however, provides evidence of Wood's intended vowel sound. {   rowspan=\\"4\\" /i/ tariha ‚Äòhot‚Äô cf.

Like the vowels, these consonant phonemes were reconstructed by Rudes using John Wood's vocabulary and knowledge of related languages. Most of the symbols that Rudes uses are the same as the IPA symbols. Where they differ, the IPA symbol is included in square brackets. The three labial consonants are in parentheses because these phonemes are only present in five words of the language, none of which are of Iroquoian descent. The letter ‚Äòm‚Äô also sometimes occurs at the end of a word after a vowel, but this is to indicate nasalization of the previous vowel, not the presence of the phoneme /m/ (Rudes 1981: 29). {   Labial Dental Palatal Velar Glottal - Plosive (p) t  k  î - Nasal (m) n    - Affricate   ƒç [tÕ° É]   - Fricative (f) s   h - Approximant  r y [j] w  } The following table shows example words with each of these consonants (also from the Wood vocabulary as cited in Rudes 1981: 31). Comparison to related languages (primarily Tuscarora) allowed Rudes to reconstruct some of the consonant phonemes (in bold). {   rowspan=\\"7\\" /t/ aheeta 'sun' cf.

Most words, however, are consistent with the syllable structure (C)V(C)(C): {  !Syllable shape !Wood's Nottoway spelling ! - V otosag 'tooth' - CV gakuhar 'to wash' - CVC orwisag 'tail' - CVCC wakwast 'good' - VC orwisag 'tail' } An exception is words that begin with /kw/ (which may have been a complex segment): {  - A Rabbit Quer≈´ cf. Tuscarora kw«Ω:ruh } There is also limited evidence that words could end in three consonants: {  - A Squirrel osarst  } Consonant clusters must include /w/ or /s/, and possibly /n/. /w/ is the most common, but /s/ is still regularly seen in words like Whisk 'five'. The status of /n/ is uncertain since Wood used to represent nasal vowels. Aside from Whisk 'five', most content words are multisyllabic. == Grammar ==  Possessive prefixes  Rudes (1981) notes that Nottoway has two series of pronominal prefixes used for inalienable and alienable possession. Inalienable nouns, such as body parts, are possessed with the prefix ge- 'my': ge-snunke 'my hand', ge-tunke 'my belly'. Alienable nouns are possessed with the prefix ak- 'my': ak-uhor '(my) old man', aqu-eianha '(my) boy'. These two series of pronominal prefixes are also used on verbs, where they indicate the agent and patient, respectively. The full set of prefixes is listed in the table below (Rudes 1981: 38-39). {  ! colspan=\\"3\\" Possessive prefixes -  colspan=\\"3\\" First singular inalienable possessive (my; I) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" ge- ge-snunke ‚Äòmy hand‚Äô (recorded as ‚Äòyour hand‚Äô) - ge-tunke 'my belly' (recorded as 'your belly') -  colspan=\\"3\\" Second singular inalienable possessive (your; you) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" se-/s- se-tunke ‚Äòyour belly‚Äô (recorded as ‚Äòmy belly‚Äô) - se-tarakƒì ‚Äòthe head (your head)‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" Feminine/zoic inalienable possessive (her/one's; she) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" ye-/e- ye-tunke '(one's) nails' - e-skaharant '(one's) mouth' -  colspan=\\"3\\" First-person singular alienable possessive (my; I/me) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" ak-/aqu- ak-uhor ‚Äò(my) old man‚Äô - aqu-eianha ‚Äò(my) boy‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" Second-person singular alienable possessive (your; you) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" sa- sa-ttaak '(your) bed' - sa-tuntatag '(you) listen' -  colspan=\\"3\\" Feminine/zoic kinship possessive (her/one's; she/it/one)‚Äô -  rowspan=\\"2\\" go- go-tyƒÅg ‚Äò(one‚Äôs) marriage‚Äô - go-tyakum ‚Äò(her) husband‚Äô }  Other affixes  In addition to the possessive prefixes, Rudes (1981, 37-42) identifies a number of other affixes appearing in the Wood vocabulary. They are as follows: {   colspan=\\"3\\" Partitive (indicates part of a whole; also used to form multiples of ten) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" ne(e)- newisha ‚Äòshort‚Äô - arsaneewarsa 'thirty' -  colspan=\\"3\\" Dualic -  rowspan=\\"2\\" de-, to-, te- towatgeheterise ‚Äòlightning‚Äô - dewartha ‚Äòtwenty‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" Aorist -  rowspan=\\"2\\" wa-, un- untchore 'to eat' - wasweke 'to speak' -  colspan=\\"3\\" Semireflexive -  rowspan=\\"2\\" at-, t-, ate- satuntatag '(you) listen' - untoreesweg '(it) drown(ed)' -  colspan=\\"3\\" Reflexive (action done to oneself) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" tat- untatren ‚Äò(it) cut‚Äô - untatreeyou ‚Äò(it) kill(ed)‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" Simple Noun -  rowspan=\\"2\\" -ag ototorag 'door' - onushag 'house' -  colspan=\\"3\\" Internal locative (‚Äúin,‚Äù ‚Äúunder‚Äù) -  rowspan=\\"1\\" -coon oraracoon ‚Äòthe woods‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" External locative (usually means ‚Äúon,‚Äù or ‚Äúat,‚Äù but loses its locative meaning when attached to a body part) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" -ke setunke ‚Äòyour belly‚Äô - skeshunke ‚Äòyour flesh‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" Characterizer (person who is part of a group) -  rowspan=\\"1\\" -hoka, -haka î tcherohaka î ‚ÄòCheroenhaka people‚Äô -  colspan=\\"3\\" ‚ÄúTeen‚Äù (as in ‚Äúthirteen,‚Äù ‚Äúfourteen,‚Äù etc.) -  rowspan=\\"2\\" -ahr arsaskahr ‚Äòthirteen‚Äô - dekraskahr ‚Äòeighteen‚Äô - }  Word order  Most of the written Nottoway materials are vocabularies rather than texts, so scholars can only make limited assumptions about the syntactic structure of the language. However, Rudes (1981) explains three syntactic characteristics that are supported by recorded Nottoway evidence: 1\\\\. The definite article precedes a noun, as in Tuscarora. Hahen≈© 'the thunder' (cf. Tuscarora ha î h√≠ în…ôÃÉ î) 2\\\\. Of two adjacent nouns, the first noun modifies the second. Acquia ohonag 'deer skin' (from acquia'deer' + ohonag 'skin') 3\\\\. An adjective follows the noun it modifies, and most likely could also precede it. Unksawa wokenhu 'the new year' (from wokenhu 'year') Rudes tentatively reconstructs noun incorporation based on these examples: {  - ! Nottoway yuhtaquaahkum 'shoemaker' (lit. 'one makes shoes') -  yu- 'neuter patient prefix' -  -htaqua- 'shoe' (cf. Tuscarora uhn√°hkwa î, Seneca aht√°hkwa î) -  -ahkum 'to assemble' (cf. Tuscarora -ahk 'to pick up') } {  - ! Nottoway satuntatag 'to listen' (lit. 'you stand up your ears') -  s- 'second singular agent prefix' -  -at- 'reciprocal' -  -unta- 'ear' (cf. Tuscarora uh…ôÃÉÃÅhn√¶h, Onondaga oh…ôÃÉÃÅhta î) -  -tag 'to stand + '(?) descriptive aspect' (cf. Onondaga ikta î 'I'm standing,' Seneca iÀêkeÀêt) } == Vocabulary == The following vocabulary is from Wood as cited in Rudes (1981: 30-31, 46-48) from the version Jefferson sent to Du Ponceau.

Greenfield argued against the positivist orientation of the so-called Theory Movement in educational administration and proposed a subjectivist approach to the study of educational administration. In his view, educational organizations have no existence beyond the actions, perceptions and values of the members of the organization. Thomas Greenfield's work has been studied and commented by numerous authors.Macmillan, R. Questioning Leadership: The Greenfield Legacy. (2003). Althouse PressGronn, P. Rethinking educational administration: T B Greenfield and his critics The Canadian Association for the Study of Educational Administration instituted the Thomas B. Greenfield PhD Dissertation Awardhttp://www.csse- scee.ca/awards/about/thomas_b._greenfield_dissertation_award in his honour. The award is presented at the annual conference of the Canadian Society for the Study of Education.http://www.csse-scee.ca/csse/ == Life == Thomas Greenfield was born in 1930 in Saskatchewan, Canada. He studied English and German at the University of British Columbia. After graduating from the undergraduate program in British Columbia he began teaching in schools and eventually moved to the field of educational administration. In 1961 he moved to Edmonton Alberta to join the Masters program in Educational Administration at the University of Alberta and subsequently he completed a PhD in the same department. After a period at the University of Alberta he returned to the University of British Columbia where he worked as a professor and researcher. After a brief stay in British Columbia, he received an appointment at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto where he wrote his most influential works.T. B. Greenfield & P. Ribbins (Eds.). Greenfield on educational administration: Towards a humane science == Writings == Greenfield was reluctant to frame his discussion about organizations using the classic metaphysical binaries. He noted that ‚Äúorganizations are essentially arbitrary definitions of reality woven in symbols and expressed in language‚ÄùGreenfield, T. B. The Man Who Comes Back through the Door in the Wall: Discovering Truth, Discovering Self, Discovering Organizations. (1980). he argued that organizations could not be described as independent entities from human will and perception. In his work, Greenfield showed that there are deep ethical and political implications to any conception of educational organizations, particularly in relation to freedom, agency and responsibility.Macmillan, R. (Ed.). Questioning leadership: The Greenfield legacy He criticized positivist accounts of educational administration, according to which individuals are essentially different and separate from organizations. He argued that human will and values are fundamental to the study of schools.Greenfield, T. B. Organizations as Social Inventions: Rethinking Assumptions About Change. (1973). Greenfield noted that organizing is a symbolic act that carries political and ethical significance. He indicated that meaning in organizations plays a pivotal role in defining our interpretation of organizational reality. Other overlapping themes in Greenfield‚Äôs work are the ontology of organizations, the epistemology of organizing, the role of meanings in the interpretation of organizational realities, and the ethical/political significance of educational administration.T. Greenfield and P. Ribbins (Eds.) Greenfield on Educational Administration == Influences == One of the most notable influences in Greenfield's work was Max Weber. Weber proposed that observers of a culture engage in a systematic process of interpretive understanding (Verstehen) in order to relate to that culture. According to Weber, the observers of a culture try to understand the culture‚Äôs social reality from the perspective of the members of that culture. Based on Weber's ideas, Greenfield indicated that the creation of the organizational reality is a participatory process in which actors interpret and construct their own reality, assigning meaning to their actions in the context of their interpersonal experiences.Innes-Brown, M. , T.B.

Its total prize purse was finalized as $105,515 ($ when adjusted for inflation); with the winner taking home $17,725 ($ when adjusted for inflation). By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power anymore. The NASCAR Winston Cup Series was also plagued with top teams running big engines and finishing in third place to avoid inspection around the early-1980s. ==Background== During the 1980s, North Wilkesboro Speedway was noticeably lagging behind other speedways on the NASCAR circuit, but the fans were more interested in the great racing action between the legendary drivers. Enoch's focus was more on the fans' enjoyment rather than on building large suites and new facilities. Attendance and total purse for races at the track were the lowest in NASCAR, but the events continued to sell out and attract more fans each year. ==Race report== Just months prior to the race, a new kind of asphalt was placed but did not get a chance to completely solve the disintegration problem.September 21, 1980 Holly Farms 400 at SavetheSpeedway.net The racetrack developed a slick surface; that made qualifying speeds slower and the cars more likely to spin and crash with each other. Conditions for the race would become very poor by the standards of the early 1980s; causing the pace car to crash into a parked car getting back into pit lane. Richard Childress, the current owner of Richard Childress Racing, would compete as a driver. There were 30 American-born drivers on the racing grid; no foreigners or women competed in this race. Bobby Allison managed to defeat Darrell Waltrip by half a second after more than three hours of racing. Cale Yarborough would acquire the pole position through driving his qualifying session at an incredible top speed of almost . Bobby Allison scores his last win for Bud Moore and his last in a Mord Motor Company product. This was his fourth win of 1980.

(1992). The effects of technological self-efficacy and job focus on job performance, attitudes, and withdrawal behaviors. The Journal of Psychology, 126, 465-475. This is a specific application of the broader and more general construct of self-efficacy, which is defined as the belief in one's ability to engage in specific actions that result in desired outcomes.Bandura, A. (1997). Self efficacy: The exercise of control. New York: Freeman. Self efficacy does not focus on the skills one has, but rather the judgments of what one can do with his or her skills. Traditionally, a distinguishing feature of self efficacy is its domain-specificity. In other words, judgments are limited to certain types of performances as compared to an overall evaluation of his or her potential. ==Origins== TSE does not highlight specific technological tasks; instead it is purposely vague. As such, this construct was intended to describe general feelings toward the ability to adopt new technology and is therefore generalizable across a number of specific technologies. Furthermore, this construct can account for and be applied to technologies that have yet to be invented. Although these features have allowed TSE to remain relevant through the times, this definitional breadth has also created confusion and a proliferation of related constructs. Typically, these constructs refer to specific types of technology; for example, computer self-efficacy,Compeau, D. R., & Higgins, C. A. (1995). Computer self-efficacy: Development of a measure and initial test. Management Information System Quarterly, 19, 189-211. or internet self-efficacyJoo, Y-J, Bong, M., & Choi, H-J (2000). Self-efficacy for self-regulated learning, academic self-efficacy, and internet self-efficacy in web-based instruction. Educational Technology Research and Development, 48, 5-17. and information technology self-efficacy.Staples, D. S., Hulland, J. S., & Higgins, C. A. (1999). A self-efficacy theory explanation for the management of remote workers in virtual organizations. Organization Science, 10, 758-776. In order to organize this literature, technology specific self-efficacies (e.g., computer and internet) that technology specific self-efficacies can be considered sub-dimensions under the larger construct of technological self- efficacy. ==Importance== 21st-century society is completely embedded within a technological context, which makes the understanding and evaluation of technological self efficacy critical. Indeed, nearly half of Americans own smartphones and this trend towards technology use is not limited to the United States; instead cell phone, computer, and internet use is becoming increasingly common around the world. Technology is particularly prevalent in the workplace and learning environments. At work, 62% of employed Americans use the internet and email, but workplace internet users either use the internet everyday (60%) or not at all (28%).Madden, M., & Jones, S. (2008, September 24). Networked workers. (PDF) Internet and email use is obviously influenced by work duties, but 96% of employed Americans use some sort of new communication technology on the job. Successful investment in technology is associated with enhanced productivity; however, full realization of technological potential commonly plagues organizations.Johansen, R., Swigart, R. (1996). Upsizing the Individual in the Downsized Organization: Managing in the Wake of Reengineering, Globalization and Overwhelming Technological Change. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA. In learning environments, college courses are more frequently being offered online. This is commonly referred to as distance education and implementation ranges from courses being supported by the web (teaching occurs predominantly through face-to-face instructor interactions with supplemental materials being offered on the web) to blended learning (significantly less face-to-face instructor interactions and more online instruction) to fully online (all instruction is conducted virtually with no face-to-face instructor interactions). A number of advantages are associated with distance learning such as increased flexibility and convenience, which allows individuals the opportunity to enroll in classes that would otherwise be off-limits due to geographical or personal reasons.Phipps, R., & Merisotis, J. (1999). What's the difference? A review of contemporary research on the effectiveness of distance learning in higher education. Washington, DC: Institute for Higher Education Policy. Another commonly cited advantage is that instruction is self paced, which allows for personalized tailoring based on individual needs.Vrasidas, C., & McIsaac, M. S. (2000). Principles of pedagogy and evaluation for web-based learning. Educational Media International, 37, 105-112. However, these advantages are not likely to be realized if the individual is anxious about the method of instructional delivery and/or his or her expectation of success is low due to its technological component. Taken together, these two critical arenas discussed above (workplace and learning) reinforce the extent to which technology has impacted modern activities and consequently the importance of perceived beliefs in one's ability to master new technology. Success in everyday life often hinges on the utilization of technology and by definition, new technology will always be new. Therefore, this construct warrants review. Furthermore, studies have shown that technological self-efficacy is a crucial factor for teaching computer programming to school students, as students with higher levels of technological self-efficacy achieve higher learning outcomes. In this case, the effect of technical self-efficacy is even stronger than the effect of gender.Brauner, P., Leonhardt, T., Ziefle, M., & Schroeder, U. (2010): The effect of tangible artifacts, gender and subjective technical competence on teaching programming to seventh graders. Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Informatics in Secondary Schools (ISSEP 2010), LNCS 5941. pp. 61‚Äì71. Differentiation from other forms of self-efficacy Since TSE stems from the same theory as general self-efficacy and other task- specific self-efficacy, the differentiation of this construct from these other forms of self-efficacy is crucial. Unfortunately, previous studies focusing in on TSE have not shown the uniqueness of TSE measures. Despite the dearth of differentiating research on TSE, the uniqueness of this construct can be shown by considering closely related and technology specific self-efficacies (i.e. computer self-efficacy), which has been established as a unique construct. When compared to general self-efficacy, computer self-efficacy has been shown to be unique based on two measures of general self-efficacy.Chen, G., Gully, S. M., & Eden, D. (2001). Validation of a new general self-efficacy scale. Organizational Research Methods, 4, 62-83. In this same study, the authors showed computer self-efficacy was not related to many types of specific self- efficacy including art, persuasion, and science self-efficacy. One of the most related types of specific self-efficacy was mechanical. This makes sense given both types of specific self-efficacies are related to using tools albeit one being technology the other being more physical in nature. Computer self- efficacy has a domain has also been shown to be related, but distinct, to self-efficacy about computer programs.Agarwal, R., Sambamurthey, V., & Stair, R. M. (2000). Research Report: The evolving relationship between general and specific computer self-efficacy-An empirical assessment. Information Systems Research, 4, 418-430 ==Measurement== Following the definition set forth by Bandura, self-efficacy is an individual's belief and confidence in him or herself. This property has important implications for the measurement of any type of self-efficacy. Specifically, measures of self-efficacy must be self- report because the only person who can accurately portray beliefs in one's ability is the target of investigation. In other words, self-report measures of self-efficacy have definitional truth. While a number of problems exist with self-report inventories, in the case of self-efficacy (and other constructs that are defined as internal beliefs and cognitions) this measurement approach is unavoidable. While the type of measurement approach is defined by the construct, the process of developing and validating these scales has varied considerably throughout the TSE literature. One major difference between measures concerns the scoring of the items. Previously, research has noted differences in results can be partially attributed to different scoring approaches.Lee, C., & Bobko, P. (1994). Self-efficacy beliefs: Comparison of five measures. Journal of Applied Psychology, 79, 364-369 Specifically, there are two main ways of scoring self-efficacy items. The first type is called self-efficacy magnitude. Items are worded so participants would respond whether or not they felt they could accomplish a certain task (yes or no). The second type is self-efficacy strength. This scoring approach asks participants to rate how confident they are in completing the task(s) on a numerical scale and then averages across all items. All other scoring types are simply composites of these first two approaches. Another difference between TSE measures concerns the issue of generality. This consideration is similar to the previous differentiation between-TSE as a broader concept and technology specific self-efficacy. Measurement attempts of the broader concept of technological self-efficacy will be considered first. McDonald and Siegall developed a five-item likert scale of technological self-efficacy based on the consideration of previous theoretical studies. This scale was scored using the strength approach to self-efficacy scales. Items in this scale were not referring to specific technologies, but instead focused on technology as a general concept. Using a development process, Holcomb, King and Brown, also proposed a scale to measure TSE Holcomb, L. B., King, F. B., & Brown, S. W. (2004). Student traits and attributes contributing to the success in online courses: Evaluation of university online courses. The Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 2, 1-17. Factor analysis revealed three distinct factors containing 19 likert- type items, which also was scored according to the strength scoring system. In contrast to the McDonald and Siegall scale, the items in this scale referenced certain technologies (specifically computers and software packages). The two studies mentioned above represent of attempts to measure TSE as a broader concept. In addition to the attempts to measure TSE more broadly, a number of studies have developed measures of technology specific self-efficacy. One of the most cited measures of computer self-efficacy comes from Compeau and Higgins. These authors reviewed previous attempts to measure computer self- efficacy and theoretically derived a 10-item scale. Unlike previously mentioned scales, this study employed a \\"composite\\" scoring approach. For each item, participants were first asked whether they could complete a specific task related to computers using a dichotomous yes/no scale. Following this answer, participants were then asked to rate their confidence about completing the task from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident). The final score was calculated by counting the number of \\"yes\\" answers (reflecting self- efficacy magnitude) and the average of the confidence ratings (representing self-efficacy strength). The authors then validated this measure in a nomological network of related constructs. A second example of technology specific self-efficacy is internet self-efficacy. Similar to previous measurement approaches, internet self-efficacy was developed using a theoretical approach that considered previous measures of related topics and developed novel items to address the missing construct space. This scale showed a high level of reliability and validity. ==Antecedents== Bandura proposes four primary sources for self efficacy beliefs; (1) prior experience, (2) modeling, (3) social persuasions, and (4) physiological factors. Research supports that many of these sources for TSE are the same; however, there are additional antecedents as well. Although more complex theoretical development and empirical examination addressing how these antecedents operate and relate to one another has not been addressed, the most immediate predictors of TSE are more likely to be Bandura's primary sources (proximal predictors). The remaining antecedents that have also been associated with TSE (e.g., adequate resources, gender, and age) are likely to be more distal predictors. In other words, these distal variables influence more proximal variables (e.g., prior experience, modeling, and social persuasions), which then result in high or low TSE. Prior experience Prior experience with technology is repeatedly found to be influential on technology related self efficacy beliefs.Compeau, D. R., Higgins, C. A. (1995b). Application of social cognitive theory to training for computer skills. Information Systems Research, 6, 118-143.Hill, T., Smith, N. D., & Mann, M. F. (1987). Role of efficacy expectations in predicting the decision to use advanced technologies: The case for computers. Journal of Applied Psychology, 72, 307‚Äì313.Jorde-Bloom, P., & Ford, M. (1988). Factors influencing early childhood administrators' decisions regarding the adoption of computer technology. Journal Educational Computing, 4, 31‚Äì47.Murphy, C. A., Coover, D., & Owen, S. V. (1989). Development and validation of the computer self-efficacy scale. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 49, 893‚Äì899. If an individual has had the opportunity to interact with new technologies and, more importantly, has had success with mastering new technologies then individuals are more likely to hold more positive beliefs for future performance. Modeling or participation in technological training Modeling or participation in technological training are also found to be significant predictors of technological self efficacy.Brinkerhoff, J. (2006). Effects of long-duration, professional development academy on technology skills, computer self efficacy, and technology integration beliefs and practices.

Factorial validity of computer self-efficacy scale and the impact of computer training. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 54, 813‚Äì821. Although different types of training interventions have been associated with different gains;Smith, J. M. (1994). The effects of education on computer self-efficacy. Journal of Industrial Teacher Education, 31, 51‚Äì65. in general, research supports that seeing other individuals successfully perform the task at hand (for example, the instructor) and then providing the learner with some opportunity for reinforcement and demonstration (for example, trying to successfully utilize the technology without aid) increases technology related self efficacy beliefs. Social persuasions Social persuasions such as encouragement by others and organizational supportHenry, J. W., & Stone, R. W. (1994). A structural equation model of end-user satisfaction with a computer-based medical information system. Information Resources Management Journal, 7(3), 21‚Äì33.Igbaria, M., & Iivari, J. (1995). The effects of self-efficacy on computer usage. Omega, 23(6), 587-605. are also important contributors to technology related self efficacy beliefs. The actions and statements of others can significantly alter perceptions of their likelihood for success. Organizational support typically includes management's encouragement and assistance. If management does not appear to enthusiastically support employees' attempts to utilize technology then employees are unlikely to accept technology. Resources Resources are commonly cited as one of the largest barriers to adoption of technology.Burkhardt, M. E. & Brass, D. J. (1990). Changing patterns or patterns of change: The effects of a change in technology on social network structure and power. Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, 104-127.Butler, D., & Sellboom, M. (2002). Barriers to adopting technology for teaching and learning. Educause Quarterly, 2, 22-28.Shamburg, C. (2004). Conditions that inhibit the integration of technology for urban early childhood teachers. Information Technology in Childhood Education Annual, 227-244. This includes, but is not limited to, sufficient computers, sufficient software licenses, out-of-date hardware/software, and slow or intermittent Internet connections. The success of proper technology use is first and foremost limited by the capabilities of the technology in question. Gender Gender is significantly related, such that men tend to have higher levels of technology related self efficacy beliefs than women.Durndall, A., & Haag, Z. (2002). Computer self efficacy, computer anxiety, attitudes towards the Internet and reported experience with the Internet, by gender, in an East European sample.

It is still unknown why these gender differences exist. Age Age is also significantly related, such that younger individuals tend to have higher levels of technology related self efficacy beliefs than older individuals.Reed, K. Doty, & May, (2005). The impact of aging on self-efficacy and computer skill acquisition. Journal of Managerial Issues, 17, 212-228.Suls, J. & Mullen, C. (1982). From the cradle to the grave: Comparison and self-evaluation across the life-span. In J. Suls (Ed.), Psychological Perspectives on the Self, Vol. 1, Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 97‚Äì125. This finding is not surprising given the widespread stereotype of older adults' inability to learn new material, especially when the material is technology related.Posthuma, R. A. & Campion, M. A. (2009). Age stereotypes in the workplace: Common stereotypes, moderators, and future research directions. Journal of Management, 35,158-188. However, older adults' low technological self efficacy beliefs suggest that older adults may internalize the 'old dogs can't learn new tricks' stereotype, which consequently affects expectations about future performance in technology related domains. ==Consequences== Technology related self efficacy beliefs have been linked with a number of consequences. Although, TSE does predict the outcomes reviewed below, please note that some of the antecedents to TSE are better predictors of these outcomes than TSE itself. For example, prior experience is typically a better predictor of task performance than TSE. A recent meta-analysis about self- efficacy (more generally) supports this conclusion as well.Judge, T. A., Jackson, C. L., Shaw, J. C., & Scott, B. A., & Rich, B. L. (2007). Self- efficacy and work-related performance: The integral role of individual differences. Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, 107- 127. doi: 10.1037/0021-9010.92.1.107 Taken together, TSE is important but its importance should not be overstated. Furthermore, it is possible that the effect of TSE on outcomes (e.g., performance) operates through other variables (e.g., behavioral intentions or anxiety). Task performance Task performance is negatively affected, such that lower technology related self efficacy beliefs are related to poorer performance This is extremely important, because these findings suggest that positive perceptions of individuals' technological capabilities may need to be present before successful performance can be achieved. Perceived ease of use and usage Perceived ease of use and usage is found to be positively related with technology related self efficacy beliefs.Agarwal, R., Sambamurthy, V., Stair, R. M. (2000). Research report: The evolving relationship between general and specific computer self-efficacy ‚Äìan empirical assessment.Information Systems Research, 11, 418-430.Venkatesh, V., & Davis, F. D. (1996). A model of the perceived ease of use: Development and test. Decision Science, 27, 451-481. According to the Technology Acceptance Model,Davis, F. D. (1989). Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance. MIS Quarterly, 13, 319- 340. perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness influences behavioral intentions and ultimately technology related behaviors. Other scholars have behavioral intentions to act as a mediator between TSE and other outcome variables (performance). These predictions are similar to those of the well supported Theory of Planned Behavior.Ajzen, I (1991). The theory of planned behavior. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179-211. doi: 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T. Anxiety Anxiety is negatively related, such that lower technology related self-efficacy beliefs are associated with higher level of anxiety.Russell, G., & Bradley, G. (1997). Teachers' computer anxiety: Implications for professional development.

Other notable works include recurring as Marco Pasternak on AMC's Better Call Saul and co-starring on the short-lived Fox sitcoms Running Wilde and Enlisted. ==Life and career== Rodr√≠guez was born in Miami, Florida, and grew up in its Little Havana neighborhood. He first pursued a career in boxing, until he was led onto the path of acting by his high school teacher at age 17, first starring in an AIDS awareness play entitled The Inner Circle with Pedro Zamora. He dropped out of high school and managed to receive a scholarship, which he used to graduate from SUNY Purchase. After his graduation, Rodr√≠guez stayed in Purchase and managed a cigar shop, from time to time visiting New York City to act on stage. He did his first role on screen in 1999 in an episode of the legal drama television series Law & Order, which was filming in the state. Rodr√≠guez then moved to Los Angeles, focusing more on his career in the film industry and less on his acting on stage. His first role in a full-length feature film was in the 1999 comedy Wirey Spindell. He achieved his breakthrough by scoring the recurring role of Frank on the ABC comedy series George Lopez in 2002. Rodr√≠guez is most known for his recurring roles as Sgt. N√∫√±ez on Community and SPC Chubowski on the Fox sitcom Enlisted. He portrayed Marco Pasternak, the best friend and partner-in-crime of Jimmy McGill in the first and third seasons of Better Call Saul. He had a brief role as Officer Morales in the 2002 film Panic Room, and was a regular on The Last Man on Earth (2015).

Though open for only a few years in the 1820s, it produced several prominent alumni, including President Franklin Pierce. ==History== In 1823 Judge Samuel Howe (1785 - 1828) opened a law school in Northampton which was modeled on his alma mater, the Litchfield Law School. Howe operated the school from his law offices with the assistance of his partner Elijah H. Mills. In addition, Howe also enlisted the aid of local lawyer John H. Ashmun (the son of United States Senator Eli Porter Ashmun and brother of Congressman George Ashmun).Ellis, Rufus, Memoir of the Hon. Samuel Howe, 1850, pages 25 to 28 The school continued with Howe in the lead role until his death in 1828. When Mills decided to curtail his participation, Ashmun took on leadership of the school.Rines, George Edwin and Beach, Frederick Converse, editors, The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 9, 1904, entry for \\"LAW\\" In 1829 Ashmun was appointed to a professorship at Harvard Law School.

In 1965 they met producer Norman Petty, who was on a promo tour in Europe. They recorded a couple of singles with Petty, who also suggested them to change their name into 'The Pebbles.' In 1967 they signed with manager Louis de Vries, who was also working with Ferre Grignard. De Vries managed to get them signed with record label Barclay. One year later they released their single \\"Get Around\\", which became their first hit. Their next single \\"Seven Horses in the Sky\\" became their biggest success. The band scored a couple of hits in Belgium, France and Spain and started to build a good live-performance reputation, which resulted in them sharing the bill with Jimi Hendrix and The Small Faces at the Olympia in Paris.Belpop \\"Episode 2-The Pebbles.\\" Canvas, October 18, 2010 Because Barclay was not interested in the Anglo-Saxon world, they never released anything in the UK. The band decided to send a copy of their single \\"Incredible George\\" to George Harrison, whom the song was about. Harrison was charmed by their music, which lead The Pebbles into almost signing with Apple Records, the label founded by The Beatles, and sent them a telegram congratulating them. However, Barclay would not let them go so the record deal was off. In 1969, they released their first album The Pebbles. Though the sales were not as good as hoped for. The discussions between members Luc Smets and Fred Bekky, about the musical direction the band was heading, reached its climax, dividing the band into two. As a result, the band went through some personnel changes. Years later they finally managed to end their obligations with Barclay and signed with United Artists, wanting airplay in the UK and US. In 1973 they released their second album Close Up. They had some minor hits, but never managed to have the same success as before. The band split in 1974, with certain members starting their own projects. The Pebbles are still considered to be one of the first and most successful pop/rock bands in Belgium. ==Members== * Guitar/Vocals: Fred \\"Bekky\\" Beekmans / Bob \\"Bobott\\" Baelemans * Bass: Miel Gielen / Axel Van Duyn / Patrick Wyns * Drums: Louis De Laet / Marcel De Cauwer / Rafael \\"Johnny\\" Verhas / Tony Gyselinck * Keyboard: Luc Smets / Tim Turcksin / Ronny Brack ==Discography== Albums * The Pebbles / Jess & James ‚Äì Pop made in Belgium (Music For Pleasure ‚Äì 1966) * The Pebbles (Barclay ‚Äì 1969) * Close Up (United Artists ‚Äì 1973) * The Story of the Pebbles 1964-1994 (Indisc ‚Äì 1994) Singles * \\"Let's say goodbye\\" (CBS, 1965) * \\"It's alright with me now\\" (CBS, 1965) * \\"Huma la la la\\" (Canon, 1966) * \\"Someone to lov\\" (Arcade, 1967) * \\"I got to sing / You better believe it\\" (Barclay, 1967) * \\"Get Around\\" (Barclay, 1967) * \\"Seven Horses in the Sky\\" / \\"The verger\\" (Barclay, 1968) * \\"Incredible George / Playing chess\\" (Barclay, 1969) * \\"Mackintosh\\" (Barclay, 1969) * \\"24 hours at the border\\" (Barclay, 1970) * \\"To the rising sun\\" (Barclay, 1971) * \\"Down at Kiki\\" (Barclay, 1971) * \\"Beggar / Amontillado\\" / Fire (Barclay, 1971) * \\"Mother army\\" (United Artists, 1972) * \\"Jan, Suzy and Phil\\" (United Artist, 1972) * \\"Some kind of joker\\" (United Artists, 1973) * \\"No time at all\\" (United Artists, 1974) * \\"The kid is allright\\" (United Artists, 1974) * \\"Figaro\\" (Killroy, 1980) ==References * Category:Belgian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1965 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1974 ","title":"The Pebbles"},{"id":"35177359","text":"The mouse Coding Region Determinant-Binding Protein (CRD-BP) is an RNA-binding protein.Doyle, G., et al. 1998. The c-myc¬¨ coding region determinant-binding protein: a member of a family of KH domain RNA-binding proteins. Nuc. Acid. Res. 26:5036-5044. CRD-BP belongs to a family of RNA binding proteins that show close a relation to the chicken Œ≤-actin zipcode-binding protein ZBP1 and the human forms of the protein IMP-1, IMP-2 and IMP-3.Liao, B., et al. 2005. The RNA-binding protein IMP-3 is a translational activator of insulin-growth factor II leader-3 mRNA during proliferation of human K562 leukemia cells. The journal of biological chemistry, 280: 18517-18524Christiansen, J., et al. 2009. IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 2: biological function and putative role in type 2 diabetes. Journal of Molecular Endocrinology, 43:187-195 Because of their close relationship, CRD-BP and its orthologs are thought to share the same biochemical properties. Upon binding to its transcripts, CRD-BP plays a role in translation by stabilizing and localizing the transcripts in the cell. Normal expression of CRD-BP has been seen in the early development of the embryo. Conversely, CRD-BP expression in adult tissue is extremely low or completely absent.Prokipcak, R., et al. 1994. Purification and properties of a protein that binds to the C-terminal coding region of human c-myc mRNA. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 12: 9261-9269. ==Structure== CRD-BP is a 577 amino acid protein that contains 4 KH domains, 2 RRMs and a RGG box (Figure 2). CRD-BP and human IMP-1 are not identical but shows a high degree of resemblance. They are very closely related to IMP-2, which has been determined through phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). As a result of this close phylogeny, the structure of the conserved functional domains is shared between CRD-BP, ZBP1 and the human IMPs (Figure 2).Chao,J., et al. 2010. ZBP1 recognition of Œ≤-actin zipcode induces RNA looping. Genes Dev, 24: 148-158. The conserved KH domains are shared throughout the orthologs and they are able to form dimers which orient the RNA binding regions in a polar opposite manner (Figure 3A). This orientation creates room for each G-X-X-G motif (Figure 3B) of each KH domain to bind its RNA transcript (Figure 3A). ==CRD-BP RNA transcripts== CRD- BP and its orthologs have been shown to have the ability to bind CD44, beta- actin, c-myc, IGF2, H19 and tau RNA transcripts. CRD-BP has been shown to play a crucial role in cancer growth and invasion of tissues. CD44 proteins belong to a family of cell surface adhesion molecules that are involved in both cell- cell and cell-matrix communications.Goodison, S., et al. 1999. CD44 Cell adhesion molecules. Mol Path, 52: 189-196. CRD-BP binds to and protects CD44 RNA which shows increased expression in cancers.Vikesaa, J., et al. 2006. RNA- binding IMPs promote cell adhesion and invadopodia formation. EMBO 25: 1456-1468. CRD-BP plays a role in the localization of Œ≤-actin mRNA by binding to the localization element in the 3'UTR region.Ioannidis, P., and T. Trangas., 2006. CRD-BP/IMP1: An RNA Binding Protein with Tumorigenic Characteristics. Trends in RNA Research. pp. 39-71. Aberrant expression of the oncogenic c-myc gene has been shown in the formation of tumours. c-myc mRNA contains a coding region instability determinant (CRD) which CRD-BP has been shown to bind, therefore, protecting c-myc mRNA from endonucleolytic attack. CRD-BP also binds IGF2 and H19 mRNA. The H19 gene is located downstream of the IGF2 on chromosome 11 and chromosome 7 on humans and mice, respectively. The binding of CRD-BP to these transcripts has shown to alter the expression of the genes. The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) is coded for by tau mRNA and is mainly found in the axon of neurons. The 3‚ÄôUTR of tau mRNA contains a cis-regulatory element that controls the axonal localization of tau mRNA. CRD- BP binds to the axonal localization signal (ALS) of tau and plays a role in the localization of the transcript. CRD-BP, therefore, has been shown to be upregulated in many diseases, including cancers. ==References== Category:RNA- binding proteins ","title":"CRD-BP"},{"id":"35177463","text":"Hazelwood is an unincorporated community in Webster Township, Rice County, Minnesota, United States.

The building that stands on the corner was built as a headquarters for a religion, called Psychiana. This building was largely used to produce and mail the lessons of Psychiana all over the world. During the twenty-five years that this religion flourished, it was the seventh largest religion in the world. The majority of the religious lessons were written and mailed off from this site. ==History of the building== Psychiana 129 West Third Street consists of two lots on the third block of the western portion of downtown Moscow. The first structure on the property was a boarding house which eventually became a funeral parlor. The Short‚Äôs Funeral Chapel used the old boarding house until the Short's sold the property to Frank B. Robinson, who was the founder of Psychiana.Lillian W. Otness, The Great Good Country: A Guide to Historic Moscow and Latah County, Idaho (Idaho: Latah County Historical Society, 1983), 41-42 With the purchase of this property, Psychiana was operating out of three buildings along the Third Street block in the heart of downtown Moscow.Frank B. Robinson, Life Story of Frank B. Robinson (Idaho: The Review Publishing Company, 1934), 158. Due to the large volume of mail that Psychiana was receiving and sending daily, the Moscow Post Office received a Class A Rating; which the post office still operates under today. As the religion began to grow, the religion began to outgrow the headquarters. In March 1934, they moved into a ‚Äúbeautiful, new concrete and brick building‚Äù which adorned the lots that Robinson acquired from the Shorts two years earlier.Frank B. Robinson, Life Story of Frank B. Robinson (Idaho: The Review Publishing Company, 1934), 154. The new building contained an air change apparatus and could also accommodate up to three working crews, as well as the immense volumes of business.Frank B. Robinson, Life Story of Frank B. Robinson (Idaho: The Review Publishing Company, 1934), 154. Psychiana employed approximately one hundred employees, and each employee handled up to 50,000 pieces of mail per day. The headquarters received an average of 1,300 pieces of correspondence each day.M. Lynne Thompson, \\"Psychiana: A 20th Century Revitalization Movement?\\" Lambda Alpha Journal 37, (2007), 42. Life after Psychiana In January 1949, Pearl Robinson sold the building on the corner of Third Street and Jackson to the Medical Arts and Professional Building, Inc. The building was largely a professional center until the property was sold to Dr. John Ayers in January 1977. Ayers went on to own the building until December 1985, when he donated the property to the University of Idaho. After he donated the building, it still remained a professional center and the university sold the property in April 2011 to Turnstone, LLC. a local development company. == References == Category:Moscow, Idaho ","title":"Turnstone Flats"},{"id":"35177508","text":"Cyathodes petiolaris is a small alpine plant in the family Ericaceae, found in Tasmania, Australia. ==References== Category:Styphelioideae Category:Flora of Tasmania Category:Taxa named by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle Category:Taxa named by George Claridge Druce ","title":"Cyathodes petiolaris"},{"id":"35177513","text":"Cary Burkett is an American radio broadcaster and former comic book writer best known for co-creating the DC Comics character Nemesis with artist Dan Spiegle. ==Biography== Cary Burkett attended the University of Texas at Austin and earned a BFA degree in theater. He moved to New York City and performed in Off-Broadway productions and wrote comic books for DC Comics. His first credits for DC were writing text articles and responses to readers' letters in the letter columns of various titles. Burkett's first published comic book story was titled \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" and appeared in House of Mystery #255 (November‚ÄìDecember 1977). His best known comics work is the character Nemesis. The character's civilian secret identity of Thomas Tresser was created by Burkett in 1979 and named for an actor with whom he was rooming with in New Hampshire. The character debuted in an eight-page backup story in The Brave and the Bold #166 (September 1980) written by Burkett and drawn by Dan Spiegle. The \\"Nemesis\\" feature ran in issues #166 through 192, and the character teamed-up with the Batman in #170 and #193. Another Burkett-created character, the Swashbuckler, debuted in Detective Comics #493 (Aug. 1980) but never appeared again. In 1983, artist Rich Buckler recruited Burkett to write the Mighty Crusaders title for Archie Comics. That same year saw Burkett begin a two-year run on DC's The Warlord title. He wrote for Marvel Comics as well, scripting an adaptation of the Sheena film and stories for Marvel Team-Up and The Spectacular Spider-Man. Upon finishing his run on The Warlord with issue #99 (November 1985), Burkett left the comics industry. Following his departure from comics, Burkett relocated to Pennsylvania and became a radio broadcaster for WITF-FM in Harrisburg. He hosted Classical Air, a classical music program. In 2011, he was a poetry reader for the Sunderman Conservatory of Music at Gettysburg College. ==Bibliography== Archie Comics *The Mighty Crusaders #4‚Äì5, 7‚Äì8 (1983‚Äì1984) DC Comics *Adventure Comics #459‚Äì460 (Green Lantern) (1978) *The Amazing World of DC Comics #16 (text article) (1977) *The Brave and the Bold #143, 147, 153, 156, 160, 168, 170, 193 (Batman team-ups); #166‚Äì169, 171‚Äì178, 180‚Äì192 (Nemesis backup feature) (1978‚Äì1982) *Cancelled Comic Cavalcade #1 (1978) *DC Comics Presents #60 (Superman and the Guardians of the Universe) (1983) *DC Special Series #19 (Wonder Woman) (1979) *Detective Comics #488, 492‚Äì493 (Batman); 491‚Äì499, 501‚Äì502, 505‚Äì506, 508‚Äì510, 512‚Äì517 (Batgirl backup feature) (1980‚Äì1982) *Ghosts #104 (1981) *Green Lantern #107‚Äì110 (1978) *House of Mystery #255, 271 (1977‚Äì1979) *House of Secrets #151 (1978) *Justice League of America #218 (1983) *Men of War #4‚Äì6, 9‚Äì11, 21‚Äì23 (1978‚Äì1979) *Secrets of Haunted House #14, 40 (1978‚Äì1981) *Superman #328 (\\"Private Life of Clark Kent\\" backup feature) (1978) *The Superman Family #195‚Äì196 (\\"Private Life of Clark Kent\\" backup feature) (1979) *The Unexpected #190 (1979) *Unknown Soldier #243‚Äì248, 254‚Äì256 (1980‚Äì1981) *The Warlord #72‚Äì99, Annual #2‚Äì4 (1983‚Äì1985) *Weird War Tales #59, 92 (1978‚Äì1980) *World's Finest Comics #265‚Äì266, 268, 272‚Äì274, 277, 279‚Äì287 (1980‚Äì1983) Collected editions * Tales of the Batman: Don Newton includes The Brave and the Bold #153, 156, and Detective Comics #488, 492-493; 360 pages, December 2011, * Batgirl: The Bronze Age Omnibus Volume 2 includes Detective Comics #491-499, 501-502, 505-506, 508-510, 512-517; 576 pages, April 2019, Marvel Comics *Marvel Super Special #34 (Sheena) (1984) *Marvel Team-Up #139, 144, 146‚Äì148 (1984) *The Spectacular Spider-Man #101‚Äì102 (1985) ==References\\"DC Profiles #30: Cary Burkett\\" at the Grand Comics Database * Cary Burkett at Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics * Cary Burkett at the Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators * Comic Treadmill: Nemesis Category:American comics writers Category:American radio personalities Category:Living people Category:Moody College of Communication alumni Category:Writers from Texas Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Cary Burkett"},{"id":"35177537","text":" MSC Fabiola is a container ship chartered by the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) and operated by the Peter D√∂hle Schiffahrtsgesellschaft Gmbh und Co.

On March 16, 2012, Fabiola docked at the Port of Long Beach, breaking earlier records for the largest container ship at a U.S. port, and at any North American port. MSC Fabiola is the first of a series of identical sister ships. The other three are MSC Faustina, MSC Fillippa, and MSC Filomena. At the first U.S. stop in Long Beach, California, the ship was too tall to fit under the Gerald Desmond Bridge and dock at MSC's own terminal, so the Hanjin terminal was used instead. Two days later, Fabiola passed under the Golden Gate Bridge to become the largest ship to enter the San Francisco Bay. The ship docked at the Port of Oakland. MSC Fabiola takes about 18 days to cross the Pacific Ocean from California to China. The presence of the MSC Fabiola at the Port of Oakland is the result of a 12-year harbor-deepening project that was largely completed in September 2009. Prior to the arrival of the Fabiola, the Port of Oakland prepared by checking channel depth and dredging as needed. San Francisco Bay pilots trained for the visit on a simulator at the California Maritime Academy for over a year. The ship arrived drawing less than its full draft of because it held only three- quarters of a load after its stop in Long Beach. ==References== Category:Container ships Category:2010 ships Category:Ships built by Samsung Heavy Industries Category:Merchant ships of Liberia ","title":"MSC Fabiola"},{"id":"35177546","text":"Natallia Stanislavauna Kareiva (; born November 14, 1985) is a Belarusian runner who specializes in the middle distance events.

He entered Melbourne University in 1921 where he studied zoology, obtaining a BSc in 1924 and a MSc in 1926.Pizzey, Graham, 'Morrison, Philip Crosbie (1900‚Äì1958)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/morrison-philip- crosbie-11177/text19917, accessed 22 March 2012. ==The journalist and educator== In 1926 Morrison joined the staff of the Melbourne Argus as a journalist. In 1938 he was persuaded by Keith Murdoch to accept the position of founding editor of a new monthly magazine, Wild Life. In order to promote the magazine he also began a series of weekly radio broadcasts on the ABC (through 3AR), 3UZ and 3DB. His Wild Life series on 3DB ran for over 20 years and made him an admired radio personality. It was syndicated throughout Australia on the Major Broadcasting Network. He was also a prominent panelist on 3DB's popular Information Please, which was also heard Australia-wide through the Major network.http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/morr/serieslist.htmFrom Wireless to Radio.

He also worked as a lecturer in natural history with the Victorian Council of Adult Education and, from 1942, with the Australian Army Education Service. ==The conservationist== Morrison had long promoted the protection of wildlife and the need for proper management of national parks in his radio broadcasts and in Wild Life magazine. In 1952 he became the inaugural chairman of the newly formed Victorian National Parks Association.

The collection consists of significant examples of the machines and materials used to build the Scheme. Films, photographic murals and artistic panoramas are also exhibited. The museum concentrates on the stories of the Snowy workers and their impact on Australia, especially on modern Australia's migration program. The museum collection was gathered by enthusiasts over a ten-year period and the Museum was officially opened to the public by Governor General Quentin Bryce on 17 October 2011. Governor General Bryce told those in attendance: \\"It is bringing this powerful component of Australia's history into a museum, for people to come and learn the history of the Snowy, for it to be passed down to generations\\". ==Snowy Scheme== Map of Snowy Mountains Scheme The Snowy Mountains scheme began construction in 1949 and was completed in 1974. It was a world-class feat of engineering and became a symbol of post-war reconstruction. It involved 100,000 workers from around the world who reversed rivers and built 16 dams, 7 power stations and 145 kilometres of tunnels. Construction of the Scheme necessitated the flooding of the Eucumbene River Valley near Old Adaminaby and resulted in the relocation of the entire population of the township and construction of a new town on the Snowy Mountains Highway away from the rising waters of Lake Eucumbene. ==References *Museum Homepage Category:Museums in New South Wales Category:Snowy Mountains Scheme Category:Snowy Mountains Highway Category:Technology museums in Australia Category:Adaminaby Category:2011 establishments in Australia Category:Museums established in 2011 ","title":"Snowy Scheme Museum"},{"id":"35177653","text":"Tizita Bogale (born July 13, 1993) is an Ethiopian runner who specializes in the middle distance events. ==Achievements== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - 2010 World Junior Championships Moncton, Canada bgcolor=gold1st 1500 m 4:08.06 - 2012 World Indoor Championships Istanbul, Turkey 4th 1500 m 4:10.98 } ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Ethiopian female middle-distance runners Category:Youth Olympic gold medalists for Ethiopia Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics ","title":"Tizita Bogale"},{"id":"35177667","text":"The Indiana‚ÄìKentucky rivalry is a college sports rivalry between the Indiana University Hoosiers and the University of Kentucky Wildcats. The rivalry between these two schools, located about apart, dates to their first college football game in 1893, and has continued across all sports, with the men's basketball series gaining particular attention. The football game was previously played for a wooden Bourbon Barrel trophy, which was discontinued in 1999. ==Men's basketball== Indiana and Kentucky played against each other in men's basketball for the first time on December 18, 1924. Since 1969 the two teams met at least once a season through the 2011-2012 season. The location of the game alternated between Assembly Hall in Bloomington and Rupp Arena in Lexington. From 1991 to 2005, the game was held at neutral sites in Indianapolis and Louisville. A scheduling conflict with Louisville's Freedom Hall in 2006 forced the series back to the schools' respective campuses. Of the 55 games between IU and UK, 48 have been played in December. There have been a total of six overtime games in this rivalry series, the most for any non-conference Kentucky rival. The rivalry has been the subject of substantial commentary and media interest. ESPN commentator Dick Vitale said of the rivalry, \\"Don't you get excited in the world of basketball thinking about Kentucky and Indiana playing? Two Goliaths, two elite programs.\\" Fellow commentator Eamonn Brennan called it \\"one of the great nonconference rivalries in the sport, which features the two storied, flagship, blueblood programs from the nation's two most basketball-obsessed states, states which just so happen to share a border.\\" The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of Indiana and Kentucky. Although the two teams had played every season since 1969, a dispute over whether future games should be played at the schools' respective home courts or at nearby neutral sites led to the cancellation of the game for the 2012‚Äì13 season. The Indiana‚ÄìKentucky basketball rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams. Remarkably, in 11 of the 56 meetings between Indiana and Kentucky, one of the schools has been ranked number one, which is nearly 20 percent of the meetings. Kentucky has won eight NCAA championships and has appeared in fifteen Final Fours, while Indiana has won five NCAA championships and appeared in eight Final Fours. Combining for thirteen national championships over the last 72 years, Indiana and Kentucky have captured 18% of the national championships, nearly one every five years. Notable story lines of the rivalry also involve major upsets by both teams and high-profile, outspoken coaches, including Bob Knight and Adolph Rupp. High-profile feuds and incidents between the schools programs have fueled the rivalry over the years. Indiana coach Bob Knight would frequently suggest that Kentucky violated NCAA recruiting rules. When asked about the rivalry by Kentucky announcer Cawood Ledford, Knight said, \\"You know, Cawood, with all the crap that has gone on down here over the years with recruiting and all, these games are not nearly as special to me as you might think.\\" Referring to UK's reputation for putting less-than-outstanding public citizens on the team, Knight later said, \\"I like to think of C. M. Newton [University of Kentucky Athletic Director] as the school's director of corrections.\\" After Knight kicked recruit Lawrence Funderburke off his team, he refused to allow Funderburke to play for Kentucky. When asked about the series in 1999, Knight claimed that it would be fine if the series were returned to the home courts and added, \\"Pitino complained because we didn't play in Rupp Arena. Rick had a tough time understanding that it was a game between Kentucky and Indiana, not between him and me.\\" Notable games *1924: The Indiana Hoosiers and Kentucky Wildcats met for the first time on December 18, 1924 in the second game ever played at the newly opened Alumni Gymnasium on the University of Kentucky campus. Both teams were led by new coaches. The 1-1 Hoosiers were headed by first year coach Everett Dean who would go on to compile a 162-93 record in 14 seasons at Indiana. Clarence Applegran, in his only season at Kentucky, coached a Wildcats team that was 1-0. Characterized in newspaper reports as a defensive game, IU held onto a five-point halftime lead to beat Kentucky 20-18. Indiana would eventually finish the 1924-1925 season 12-5 and the Wildcats 13-8. Alternating between Bloomington, Indiana and Lexington, Kentucky, the teams would meet each of the next three seasons with Indiana a double-digit victor in each game. *1940: The Indiana/Kentucky match-up resumed thirteen seasons later at the annual Sugar Bowl tournament in New Orleans before a record crowd of 7,500. Coached by Branch McCracken, the Hoosiers entered the game as the defending national champions with a record of 6-1. McCracken's team, who had just flown in from the West Coast after taking three out of four games from Stanford, California, USC, and UCLA, was described as being air sick. Adolph Rupp, destined to hold the title NCAA Division I men's basketball record-holder for victories, led a 5-2 Kentucky team that won the SEC Men's Basketball Tournament and the Sugar Bowl tournament the previous season. Curly Armstrong and Bill Menke each scored 14 to help Indiana hold off the Wildcats, 48-45. *1943 and 1944: After the 1942-1943 season, McCracken took a leave of absence from Indiana University to become a lieutenant in US Navy and was replaced by Harry Good from Indiana Central College who would take over the Indiana team during the war years. The 1943-1944 Hoosiers lost all of their returning lettermen to the armed forces and were left with a team of primarily inexperienced freshmen. Four freshmen starters, including Indiana Mr. Basketball Ed Schienbein, left for the US Navy after IU's first game. After six straight defeats (the series record), Kentucky defeated Indiana 66-41 at Jefferson County Armory in Louisville. Walter Johnson contributed 13 and Bob Brannum 12 points for the Wildcats. The victory would be the first of five straight that Kentucky would hand the Hoosiers, a feat they would duplicate later in the 1990s and the 2000s. Kentucky finished the season 19-2. Described as one of their worst seasons ever, Indiana ended-up 7-15. ::The two teams met at the same venue one year later. Led by Alex Groza, Wilbur Schu, Jack Tingle, the Kentucky team undefeated in their three previous games posted a 61-43 win over a 4-1 Indiana squad. *December 12, 1970: UK 95, IU 93 (OT): Kentucky's overtime win, 95-93, was led by 24 points and 12 rebounds from Tom Parker, 19 points from Kent Hollenback and 18 from Mike Casey. Indiana's George McGinnis scored 38 points and grabbed 20 rebounds. He had one of the best single performances in this rivalry. This was the final season of play at the Indiana Fieldhouse in Bloomington. *December 17, 1971: IU 90, UK 89 (2 OT): In 1971 Bob Knight took the head coaching job at Indiana. His first game against Kentucky went into double overtime with IU winning 90‚Äì89. Indiana's Steve Downing scored 47 points (on 19-of-39 shooting) and 25 rebounds in what would be one of the best all-time performances against Kentucky. From this game until the 1976 season, Indiana would only lose a single game to the Wildcats in seven meetings. *March 17, 1973: IU 72, UK 65: This match-up occurred in the NCAA Tournament Mideast Regional Final in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Indiana and Kentucky were programs in transition at the time. Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall was in his first season as the successor to Adolph Rupp, who spent 42 years as Kentucky's coach. Bob Knight was in his second season at Indiana and won the Big Ten outright. IU had won the regular season matchup in Bloomington, and won in Nashville as well, making 1972-73 the first and still only time that IU or Kentucky has defeated the other twice in the same season. It was an unusually rough shooting performance for a Knight era team (44 percent), but IU won the game at the free throw line, making 10 free throws to Kentucky's three. Steve Downing led IU with 23 points on 10-22 shooting, and Quinn Buckner added 16. John Laskowski scored 10 points on 4-5 shooting off the bench. The win in the regional final sent IU to the Final Four for the first of five times under Knight and for the first time in 20 years. The Hoosiers went on to lose to eventual NCAA champion UCLA in the national semifinals. *December 7, 1974: IU 98, UK 74: On December 7, 1974, Indiana and Kentucky met in the regular season in Bloomington with a 98-74 Indiana win. Near the end of the game, Indiana coach Bob Knight went to the Kentucky bench where the official was standing to complain about a call. Before he left, Knight hit Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall in the back of the head. UK's assistant coach Lynn Nance, a former FBI agent who was about 6 feet 5 inches, had to be restrained by Hall from hitting Knight. Hall later said, \\"It publicly humiliated me.\\".Atlanta Constitution Journal, 28 February 1982. ::Knight said the slap to the head was something he has done, \\"affectionately\\" to his own players for years. \\"But maybe someone would not like that,\\" he said. \\"If Joe didn't like it, I offer an apology. I don't apologize for the intent.\\" ... \\"Hall and I have been friends for a long time,\\" Knight said. \\"If he wants to dissolve the friendship, that's up to him.\\"Tev Laudeman, Louisville Courier Journal, 8 December 1974. Knight blamed the furor on Hall, noting in his inimitable style, \\"If it was meant to be malicious, I'd have blasted the fucker into the seats.\\" *March 22, 1975: UK 92, IU 90: Following a contentious regular season game, Indiana and Kentucky met in the 1975 NCAA Mideast Regional Final in Dayton, Ohio. Coming into that game, the Hoosiers were on a 34-game winning streak, and the number one ranked team in America. Kentucky was ranked number five. However, Indiana star player Scott May saw limited playing time due to a broken arm in the regular season finale against Purdue. May scored 25 points in the regular season IU-UK meeting, but he managed only 2 points in seven minutes in the Tournament game, which he played with a cast on his left arm. IU surged out to an early seven- point lead before UK rallied to tie it at 44 by halftime. Despite Indiana's Kent Benson scoring 33 points (on 13-of-18 shooting) and grabbing 23 rebounds, Kentucky won 92-90. ::The loss for Indiana prevented what could have been back-to-back undefeated seasons and national championships as the Hoosiers went on to take the national title in 1976. Bob Knight would later said that this 1974-1975 team was the best he ever coached, even better than the undefeated national champions of 1976. The win put UK in the Final Four in San Diego, where they dropped the NCAA title game in what would be John Wooden's last game. Kentucky's win over Indiana remains as one of the seminal non-title victories in the history of Kentucky basketball. It is on USA Today's list of the greatest NCAA tournament games of all time.Mike Douchant - Greatest 63 games in NCAA Tournament history. The Sports Xchange, published in USA Today, March 25, 2002 *December 15, 1979: UK 69, IU 58: In 1979 the number one ranked Indiana traveled to Rupp Arena to take on 5th ranked Kentucky. Indiana, led by future NBA Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, was handed a 69-58 defeat. Kentucky's Kyle Macy scored 12 points while Jay Shidler and Lavon Williams each added 11. Kentucky held IU to just 17 of 49 shooting (34.6 percent) and won the rebounding battle 42-29 with Fred Cowan pulling down 11 rebounds. Isiah Thomas scored 14 but IU's Randy Wittman managed just one point in 22 minutes. *March 24, 1983: UK 64, IU 59: This game occurred in the NCAA Tournament Mideast Regional Semifinal. The five banners in the south end of Assembly Hall honor IU's NCAA champions, and the banners in the north end honor various other accomplishments: NIT titles, Final Four appearances, the undefeated regular season of 1976. While there now are two banners listing the years of IU's 20 Big Ten titles, those weren't present during Bob Knight's tenure. Before 2000, the only Big Ten title banner honored the 1983 team, which Knight ordered as a tribute to the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games, over Purdue, Illinois, and Ohio State, to seal the conference title after losing Ted Kitchel to injury. While IU survived the loss of Kitchel in the regular season, in the Tournament, his absence was felt, and IU lost to Kentucky despite strong performances by Randy Wittman and Uwe Blab. *December 8, 1984: IU 81, UK 68: Indiana's Steve Alford, as a sophomore, hit 11-of-14 shots from the field and both of his free throw attempts to drop in 24 points in an 81-64 IU victory. He also had seven assists. *December 5, 1987: UK 82, IU 76 (OT): In the inaugural game of the Big 4 Classic, an annual double-header pitting UK, IU, Louisville and Notre Dame, the 5th ranked Hoosiers took on the 2nd ranked Wildcats. Indiana freshman Jay Edwards tied the game at 71-71 on a baseline jumper with :01 showing on the clock to send the game to overtime. In the extra period with UK leading 78-76, goggle-sporting Ed Davender forced Keith Smart into a turnover, Rex Chapman dove on the loose ball and fed it to Richard Madison for a dunk ‚Äì his only basket of the game ‚Äì with 34 seconds left to seal the deal. Davender, who finished with 22 points, held Smart to just five points on 2 of 9 shooting. Chapman added 20 and Cedric Jenkins contributed 14 points and 10 rebounds as five Cats reached double figures. Rick Calloway, a 6-6 guard who later transferred to Kansas, scored a game-high 26 for IU. *December 2, 1989: IU 71, UK 69: Before 40,128 in the Hoosier Dome, a Kentucky team on probation nearly upset No. 14 Indiana in the first meeting between Bobby Knight and Rick Pitino. The Wildcats led 36-32 at halftime but eventually fell to the Hoosiers, 71-69. Deron Feldhaus scored 32 points for Kentucky while Indiana got 16 points and 10 rebounds from Lawrence Funderburke, whose recruitment by Kentucky under Eddie Sutton had gotten the program in trouble with the NCAA.\\"Do you remember? The 10 best Indiana-Kentucky games ever. KentuckySports.com. Published March 22, 2012. *December 7, 1991: UK 76, IU 74: After two close losses to Indiana by a combined five points, 14th ranked Kentucky beat 9th ranked Indiana 76-74 under coach Rick Pitino. Jamal Mashburn led Kentucky with 21 points and eight rebounds while Deron Feldhaus scored 19 on 5 of 8 shooting beyond the arc. Kentucky managed to overcome a 40-14 margin in free throw attempts heavily favoring the Hoosiers by hitting on 11 of 23 treys. Indiana was 0-for-5 from behind the arc. *January 3, 1993: UK 81, IU 78: 4th ranked Indiana traveled to Louisville to take on 3rd ranked Kentucky. Kentucky made 16 of 41 three-pointers as 29 points each for Jamal Mashburn and Travis Ford were canceled out by 29 point games for Indiana's Calbert Cheaney and Matt Nover. Travis Ford's seven three-pointers were the most in a game by a single player in Kentucky history. Stifling defense by Rodrick Rhodes held Cheaney without a field goal over the final six minutes. Indiana's loss prevented Bob Knight from earning his 600th career victory. *December 4, 1993: IU 96, UK 84: Prior to this game in 1993 Kentucky was ranked number one in the nation, but Indiana upset the Wildcats and earned their first of two wins over a top-ranked UK team. Indiana's Damon Bailey hit 16-of-19 free throws (record for a single game) to score 29 points. Bailey's performance in the upset earned him a spot on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which has since become an iconic image among Indiana fans. A quote from the accompanying story summarizes the atmosphere that day: Following the win, IU led the all-time series 20-17. But it marked a turning point in the series for a while. From that game until 2011 Kentucky went 14-3 against the Hoosiers. *December 7, 1996: UK 99, IU 65: In a 99-65 UK rout, Kentucky's Derek Anderson led all scorers with 30 points while hitting 4-of-9 shots from the three-point line. Anderson also grabbed four rebounds, handed out four assists and pinched three steals. UK's Ron Mercer scored 26 points on 11-of-18 shooting. He also grabbed six rebounds and had four assists. *December 4, 1999: IU 83, UK 75: Kentucky has three five-game winning streaks over IU. Both the 1999 game and the 2005 game prevented UK from winning six in a row. In 1999, senior guards AJ Guyton (21 points, 4-6 from three) and Michael Lewis (17 points, 10-11 from the line) led IU to victory. This was Bob Knight's last IU-UK game, and gave Knight a 15-17 record against UK at IU. *December 21, 2002: UK 70, IU 64: Prior to 6th ranked Indiana and 16th ranked Kentucky meeting on December 21, 2002, Indiana coach Mike Davis stated publicly that he \\"hated Kentucky with a passion\\" and wanted to win the game \\"in the worst way.\\" During the game Davis, enraged by a foul not being called, ran wildly onto the court before the game was over. Indiana trailed only 65-64 when Davis exploded, but Kentucky's Keith Bogans made five of the six ensuing free throws to put the game out of reach and Kentucky went on to win the game 70-64. In a press conference following the game, Mike Davis said, \\"There's no way I should've acted like that. I can't explain it. I've done something to embarrass my team. ... I cost us the game. I was so emotional. I need to learn and grow from this.\\" *December 10, 2011: IU 73, UK 72: In 2011 top-ranked Kentucky traveled to Bloomington to take on unranked Indiana. Indiana fans sensed a resurgence in the program and possible upset, with students lining up outside the arena 10 hours before tipoff to get good seats. The game remained close and hard-fought, with five lead changes in the final 121 seconds. Indiana star Christian Watford hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer, giving the Hoosiers a stunning 73-72 upset. Victor Oladipo had 13 points and five Hoosiers wound up in double figures. Watford's shot sent Indiana fans storming the court and crowding around players. Kentucky's loss was their only one of the regular season and prevented them from matching a record last set by Indiana's 1975-1976 team. ::ESPN commentator Dick Vitale, who was covering the game for the network, said it was the \\"best game of the year\\" and that \\"[t]he atmosphere there was unreal, as I felt the building shaking after Watford hit the shot.\\" According to Bob Kravitz, the win marked \\"a day when Hoosier Hysteria was restored to something akin to its former glory.\\" *March 23, 2012: UK 102, IU 90: Kentucky was again ranked number one going into the South Regional Semifinals of the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament at Atlanta's Georgia Dome and was matched against #4 seed Indiana, who was responsible for one of UK's two defeats that season. Led by Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (24 points) and Doron Lamb (21 points) and the defense of Anthony Davis (9 points), Kentucky defeated Indiana by a score of 102-90 to advance to the Regional Finals on their way to their eighth NCAA Championship. End of series In 2011 Kentucky coach John Calipari briefly discussed the possibility of ending one of Kentucky's annual games against rivals Louisville, North Carolina, or Indiana. A last-second shot which propelled Indiana to victory over top-ranked Kentucky and another meeting in the 2012 NCAA Tournament (won by Kentucky) helped re-kindle the rivalry's intensity; however, Calipari and Indiana head coach Tom Crean were unable to resolve the issue of whether to play future games on the respective teams' home courts or at neutral sites. This prompted the schools to cancel their annual meeting for the 2012-13 season. After IU athletic director Fred Glass reopened negotiations on May 10, 2012, Calipari rejected Glass's compromise to play two games at Lucas Oil Stadium and one game apiece at Assembly Hall and Rupp Arena, thus ending the series.

The first women's basketball game between Indiana and Kentucky was on January 24, 1974 and an 88-54 win for Indiana, the season before Kentucky women's basketball became varsity. The Indiana-Kentucky women's basketball series was played annually on a home-and-home basis from the 1976‚Äì77 to 1990‚Äì91 seasons, except for the December 30, 1990 game played in Reno, Nevada for the New Year's Classic tournament hosted by the University of Nevada, Reno, and again from 1993‚Äì94 to 1997‚Äì98. After that, Kentucky hosted a game against Indiana on November 12, 2006, in which Indiana upset AP- ranked #21 Kentucky 54-51.2014-15 Indiana Women's Basketball History and Records Book, p. 99. As of the 2014‚Äì15 season, this remains the final scheduled game in the series, and Indiana leads the series 13‚Äì12. ==Baseball== The first Indiana‚ÄìKentucky baseball game took place on April 16, 1903, an 8-5 win for Kentucky.

It is published by Eichler Network, a company based in San Francisco that also operates a website and sends weekly e-mail news flashes to subscribers. It also publishes a service directory of firms that specialize in repair and improvement of mid-century modern homes, including those built from the 1950s to 1970s by Bay Area developer Joseph Eichler of Eichler Homes, Inc. Founded in 1993 by editor and publisher Marty Arbunich, first as a four-page letter-size black-and-white mailer and then as a 16-page tabloid newsletter also called Eichler Network, it became a 36-page oversized color magazine in January 2006. Over the years it expanded its coverage, from its early focus exclusively on Eichler homes, with an emphasis on preservation\\"The Eichler Groupies\\" and home improvement and maintenance, to historical articles on mid-century architecture and design, light features, nostalgia, music, and movies. The magazine is sent free to the property addresses of Eichler homes In Northern California, as well as to other mid- century modern homes, such as select homes built by the Streng Brothers in the Sacramento and Davis areas in the Sacramento Valley. The magazine is available by subscription but is not sold on newsstands. Its hundreds of articles also appear on the website of Eichler Network. Eichler Network, originally sent only to Eichler homeowners, started a Sacramento Valley edition in 2003, going to owners of Streng homes. The switch in format and name from Eichler Network to CA-Modern included an increased geographic scope, adding Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley, Long Beach-Orange, and Palm Springs editions, and coincided with a broadening of the subject matter. The magazine profiled several Southern California architects, including William Krisel, Don Wexler, and Ray Kappe; ran a news briefs column; reviewed books and other media; invited contemporary architects to devise a '21st Century Eichler,' and has readers compete in a best kitchen remodel contest. Its writers include Dave Weinstein, author of several books on California architecture and history; Tanja Kern, a writer and blogger whose work has appeared in many design and business magazines; and Jeff Kaliss, a music writer and author of Take You Higher: The Life and Times of Sly & the Family Stone. CA Modern has also featured a \\"Dear Cherry\\" advice column by Cherry Capri since 2005. The magazine features extensive color photography and mid-century type design. The designer is Doreen Jorgensen, and staff photographer is David Toerge. In January 2012, the magazine entered the national conversation about Apple innovator Steve Jobs, who had reportedly drawn design inspiration from his childhood Eichler home. Eichler Network investigation has shown that Jobs' home was designed by Anshen & Allen, architects who worked for Eichler, but was built by Mackay Homes.\\" ==References * Category:Visual arts magazines published in the United States Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Architecture magazines Category:Design magazines Category:Magazines established in 1993 Category:Magazines published in San Francisco ","title":"CA-Modern"},{"id":"35178075","text":"Gabriel Celebre Eigenmann (born March 2, 1978) is a Filipino actor, singer, host and model. He is currently working as an exclusive talent of GMA Network. ==Background== He was born on March 2, 1978 in Makati City, Philippines. Gabby hails from the Gil-Mesa clan of famous actors. He is the son of the late actor Mark Gil to 80s commercial model/actress Irene Celebre. He is also the nephew of Cherie Gil and Michael de Mesa, the grandson of veteran actors Rosemarie Gil and Eddie Mesa, the cousin of AJ Eigenmann, Ryan Eigenmann and Geoff Eigenmann, he is the older brother of Ira Eigenmann, and the half brother of Sid Lucero (Tim Eigenmann), Maxine and Andrea \\"Andi\\" Eigenmann. ==Career== Acting career Though he grew up in a prominent family of actors, he once regretted growing up without the whole family which barely happens. At first, entering showbusiness was out of his mind and rather be a pilot or a businessman, a cook or own a restaurant. He even took up two-year Hotel and Restaurant Management at OB Montessori in which he never saw its end. But acting has found a good place in his blood and this is how he entered show business. He started his career at the age of 16. He was once a Regal Films‚Äô teen star along with the Gwapings and other rosters of teen actors of the said film outfit. He considered Richard Gomez and Regine Velasquez as his role models.

And later in 2014, Gabby starred in his main role of Dading, together with Glaiza de Castro, Benjamin Alves and Chynna Ortaleza. Singing career After few years doing acting, Gabby ventured into a new field of interest which is singing. While his family members marvelled the audience with their acting skills, Gabby likewise wowed the aficionados with his harmonious voice and distinct talent. This new venture allowed him to be recognized more as a singer than an actor. This was his turning point of his career after he bagged three awards: Most Promising Male Artist, Best Performance by a New Male Recording Artist and Most Promising Male Singer/Performer from different respected award giving bodies. In 1999, he was featured on singer Regine Velasquez's album R2K for the track \\"For the Love of You\\" alongside KC Montero.

In 2006, he surprised once again his fans with his second album entitled Sa Di Kalayuan under GMA Records which was named after one of the tracks from the album that eventually became ear's favorite. The other track entitled Muli was also a hit and became a soundtrack of the romantic comedy series I Luv NY and theme song of the koreanovela Yellow Handkerchief, both on GMA Network. The album itself conveyed Gabby's nearness to the listening public. ==Filmography== Television {  style=\\"font-size: 97%;\\" - ccc; text-align:center;\\" Year Title Role Network -  2020  Bilangin Ang Bituin Sa Langit  Arthur Zulueta  rowspan=\\"53\\"  GMA Network -  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2019  Beautiful Justice  Ronnie Vida -  Inagaw na Bituin  George Del Mundo -  2018 Contessa  Victorino \\"Vito\\" Imperial Jr. / Duquessa Dolce Vita -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 2017  Imbestigador: Bulacan Massacre  Dexter Carlos -  My Love From The Star Jackson Libredo -  Imbestigador: Prof. D Prof. Alfredo Dimaano -  Imbestigador: Ganti Reynante Suganob -  2016‚Äì2017  Tsuperhero  Markano -  rowspan=\\"5\\"  2016  Sa Piling ni Nanay  Benedict Corpuz -  Magpakailanman: The Abused Boy  MJ -  Magkaibang Mundo  Ruben Sandoval -  Dear Uge  Bartolome -  Magpakailanman: Mahal kita, mahal ko siya  Ramil -  rowspan=\\"6\\" 2015  Beautiful Strangers  Isagani Mendoza -  Princess in the Palace  Renato -  Alamat: Ang Unang Bahaghari  Wigan -  InstaDad  Kenneth Monteamor -  Pari 'Koy  Barangay Captain Jude Banal -  Once Upon a Kiss  Father Philip \\"Father Madz\\" Madasalin -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2014  Magpakailanman: Ang Ina sa Gitna ng Tsunami  Suichi -  Dading  Ricardo \\"Carding / Dading\\" Gonzales -  Paraiso Ko'y Ikaw  Edward Rodrigo -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2013  Magpakailanman: The Art Evangelista Story  Art Evangelista -  Mundo Mo'y Akin  Ziggy Carbonel-Mendoza -  Magpakailanman: Kagat ng Asong Ulol  Eduardo Sese -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2012  Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga  Gilbert Zalameda -  Makapiling Kang Muli  Young Roman Valencia -  Broken Vow  Roberto Sebastian‚Ä† -  2011  Munting Heredera  Desmond Montereal -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2010  Jillian: Namamasko Po  Andre -  Endless Love  Jojo Cruz -  Tween Hearts  Coach A / Bulldog / Sir Boris -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2009  All About Eve  Max -  Darna  Apollo -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2008  Sine Novela: Magdusa Ka  Roland Henson -  ESP  Ivan -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 2007  Marimar  Nicandro Mejia -  Super Twins  Rex / Steelrex -  Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang: Ang Prinsipeng Duwag  Prinsipe Gandor -  Muli  Alvin -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2006  Now and Forever: Duyan  Allan -  I Luv NY  Paul Young -  2005  Sugo  Crisanto -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2004  Love to Love: Pretty Boy  Ivan -  Forever in My Heart  Abet Torallba -  2003  Twin Hearts  Cedrick Sebastian -  2002  Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga  James -  2001  Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin  Marc Fuentebella -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2000  Umulan Man o Umaraw  Nick -  Tago Ka Na!

Sausage pizza from Harris Pizza (Davenport, Iowa location) Quad City- style pizza is a unique pizza style that centers around the Quad Cities region of Iowa and Illinois in the United States. Characteristics of this style of pizza include a pizza crust made with malt, tomato sauce sometimes made with cayenne and red chili flakes, toppings placed under the cheese, and strips being cut instead of slices. == History and origin == The first business to bring \\"Quad City\\"-style pizza to the public was Frank's Pizza in 1955. Tony's Club Capri was the only sit-down style restaurant and bar. Phyllis Maniscalco, Tony's wife, worked the cash registers, helped in the kitchen when needed and helped manage the business overall. Throughout the years, Tony's children Giana and Tony Jr., as well as other family members, would also help out in the various locations. The sausage was always handmade, and Tony would pre-mix his spices by hand and measure them out in bags for his employees to then mix with the ground pork he butchered himself. Cheese was always grated in house and imported from a Chicago-area supplier. In addition to pizza, Tony served up Italian beef sandwiches, stromboli, house-made sausages, a variety of pasta dishes with his own signature marinara sauce. Desserts included spumoni ice cream and cannoli. This was his first location to offer more than just pizza. Tony Sr.'s brother Frank Maniscalco also moved to the Quad Cities upon hearing of his brother‚Äôs success and decided to open up an additional location called Frank's in Davenport off of Locust St. This is not to be confused with Frank's in Silvis, IL. Tony Sr. was friends with the Serra family, and they had approached Tony Sr. about his recipe as they wanted to start a restaurant in Minnesota. Tony obliged and, after the Minnesota location failed, the Serras came back to Tony Sr. and asked if they could open up in the Quad Cities. Since Tony Sr. did not have any restaurants in the Silvis/East Moline area at the time, it was decided that they would open a location in 1955 which still stands to this day Frank‚Äôs Club Napoli Pizza in Silvis, IL. Also, contrary to popular belief, Harris Pizza was not the original \\"Quad Cities-style pizza\\". Leonard and his wife Mary owned a small package liquor store in Rock Island, IL. Patrons often requested food, and Leonard saw this as an opportunity to expand his business. In 1960, an employee of Tony Sr. named Dick Kennedy, who also happened to be a good friend of Leonard Harris, had helped the Harris family develop the base recipe for Harris‚Äô that they still use to this day. In addition to the brick-and-mortar locations, Tony Sr. also made a name for himself in the grocery store's freezer section. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Tony had started delivering par-baked/half-baked pizzas to the local A&P; grocery stores. These were the first frozen pizzas in the Quad Cities at the time. In 1968, Tony Sr.'s pizza businesses and the recipes were sold to the family of Mama Bosso's, who to this day still make pizzas you can purchase in the freezer section of local Quad Cities grocers such as Hy-Vee. After that sale, Tony Sr. decided to venture into the home improvement business, but the restaurant industry still called his name. He would go on to open two additional locations in the 1970s ‚Äì one in East Moline and one in the Wells Fargo Bowling Alley (where Clint's used to be on the Avenue of the Cities in Moline). Tony finally got out of the restaurant business in the late 1970s when these locations were sold. He continued to work in home improvement until his untimely passing on July 6th, 1994. ==Preparation== Quad City-style pizza dough contains a characteristic spice mixture which is heavy on malt, which lends a toasted, nutty flavor. The pizzas are hand-tossed to be stretched into an even quarter-inch thin crust with a slight lip ringing the edge. The sauce contains both red chili flakes and ground cayenne, and the smooth, thin tomato spread is more spicy than sweet. The sausage is typically a thick blanket of lean, fennel-flecked Italian sausage sometimes ground twice and spread from edge to edge. The pizzas are cooked using a special gas oven with an average cooking time of about 12 minutes. The pizza is cut into strips, as opposed to being cut in slices. An average 16-inch pizza has about 14 strips, and a 10-inch pizza has about 10 strips. ==By region== The dish originates in the Quad Cities region of the United States. Cities highlighted in Blue are outside of the QC metro region. The dish has been prepared in other areas of the United States, including Mahtomedi, Minnesota, Acworth, Georgia, Mesa, Arizona West Des Moines, and Chicago. The Outsiders Pizza Company now sells a frozen version of the Quad City-style pizza nationwide through major retail store chains. ==See also== * List of regional dishes of the United States * St. Louis cuisine * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:American pizza Category:Cuisine of the Midwestern United States Category:Quad Cities Category:Pizza styles ","title":"Quad City-style pizza"},{"id":"35178468","text":"The 2012 Malian coup d'√©tat began on 21 March that year, when mutinying Malian soldiers, displeased with the management of the Tuareg rebellion, attacked several locations in the capital Bamako, including the presidential palace, state television, and military barracks. The soldiers, who said they had formed the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State, declared the following day that they had overthrown the government of Amadou Toumani Tour√©, forcing him into hiding. The coup was followed by \\"unanimous\\" international condemnation, harsh sanctions by Mali's neighbors, and the swift loss of northern Mali to Tuareg forces, leading Reuters to describe the coup as \\"a spectacular own-goal\\". On 6 April, the junta agreed with Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) negotiators that they would step down from power in return for the end of sanctions, giving power to a transitional government led by parliament speaker Dioncounda Traor√©. In the following days, both Tour√© and coup leader Amadou Sanogo formally resigned; however, as of 16 May, the junta was still \\"widely thought to have maintained overall control\\". On 3 December 2013, a mass grave was discovered in Diago holding the remains of 21 soldiers that went missing the year before, loyal to the ousted president. ==Background== Tuareg rebels launched a major offensive against Mali's security forces and military in a bid to seize the northern town of Kidal on 6 February 2012. Some loyalist Tuareg fled to the city of Bamako, fearing reprisals after violent demonstrations in the first week of February. The Tuareg rebels had been bolstered by an influx of battle- hardened, well-armed fighters returning from the Libyan Civil War, to which they had traveled to fight for Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader who was deposed and killed. On 8 February, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) seized the Mali-Algeria border town of Tinzaouaten as Malian soldiers crossed into Algeria. Islamist Ansar Dine demanded the imposition of Islamic law in northern Mali, while the secular Tuareg nationalist Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA) have stated they want an autonomous, if not completely independent, homeland. The coup attempt followed weeks of protests of the government's handling of a nomad-led rebellion in the country's north, which had dropped Tour√©'s popularity to \\"a new low\\". Soldiers demanded more weapons and resources for their campaign against the rebels, and were dissatisfied with a lack of government support for the army, some soldiers having been sent to the front without sufficient food. Tour√© was to leave office when his term expires after the presidential election in April. Factors that led to the coup:Marc Fonbaustier, Mali: a case study of a complex african crisis, 10 April 2012 * Bamako always had difficulty controlling the north of the country, a territory that had been disputed by the MNLA and its precursor groups since the 1960s. * Mali was going through a security crisis as AQIM members flooded in from Algeria and other neighboring countries. * Mali was going through a harsh food crisis that led to displaced populations, refugee camps, and starving women and children. ==Timeline== Early events 21 March On 21 March, defence minister Brigadier General Sadio Gassama went to the Kati military camp, north of Bamako, to defuse a protest planned for the next day by soldiers of the camp against perceived bad management of the conflict with the Tuareg rebellion in the north of Mali. He was met with boos and stones were thrown at his car. He was sequestered, and his guards fired warning shots in the air. The minister was released thanks to the intervention of the Kati zone commander (\\"commandant de zone\\"). The soldiers then stormed the weapons and ammunition reserves of the camp. Two soldiers were injured, but the presidency said Gassama was neither injured nor arrested. Later that day, armored vehicles sealed off the presidential palace, and reporters heard 10 minutes of automatic gunfire near the headquarters of the Malian state broadcaster, whose programmes went off the air. Soldiers blocked the path to the buildings. The Associated Press spoke with a soldier who said that when soldiers entered the palace, Tour√©'s bodyguards did not defend the building. The mutinying soldiers searched the area for Tour√©, but he was not caught. In the evening, after several hours, Mali's state broadcaster ORTM came back on the air with a brief message displayed against a backdrop of traditional Malian music and dance. \\"In a moment, there will be a statement by the military\\", the message read. A riot broke out at a military garrison near the northern town of Gao, and a military student reportedly said recruits had shot into the air and took several of their senior commanding officers hostage. 22 March Angry soldiers took over the capital city, Bamako. In the morning, Amadou Konare went on state television which identified him as the spokesperson of the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State (CNRDR), formed by the renegade soldiers. Konare declared that the soldiers had seized power from 'the incompetent regime of Amadou Toumani Tour√©' and said it would look to hand over power to a new, democratically elected government. Later, Captain Amadou Sanogo, identified as CNRDR's president, also went on state television to declare a dusk-to-dawn curfew \\"until further notice\\". He urged calm and condemned any pillaging. Soldiers were unable to find Tour√©. In the morning, Kenya's foreign minister, who was visiting Mali at the time, reported that Bamako airport had been closed and that he could hear gunfire. Sanogo also declared the land and air borders of Mali closed until further notice. A military official loyal to the President said the President was in good health, and that the Interior and the Defense Ministers were also safe ‚Äì contrary to earlier reports that the defense minister had been arrested. Foreign Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga was among several ministers arrested after rebels seized the Presidential palace and other parts of the capital. Amnesty International reported that Prime Minister Ciss√© Mariam Ka√Ødama Sidib√© had been arrested, and that the detained ministers were being held at the military camp in Kati. Later in the day it was revealed the president had sought refuge at an undisclosed army base with loyal soldiers. The BBC reported that the Malian Army's elite force, the Red Berets, was still loyal to Tour√©. Loyalists confirmed that Tour√© was \\"safe and in command\\" at a military camp somewhere in Bamako, under protection from his \\"Red Berets\\", a parachute regiment which he formerly served in. Amadou Toumani Tour√© Rebel soldiers said during the evening they intended to launch an assault on the loyalist army camp in the capital. As the day progressed, the rebel soldiers looted the Presidential Palace, taking TVs and other goods, while their leader urged them to stop the celebratory gunfire, which had been responsible for at least 20 injuries in the capital. =Tuareg advance= Inspired in part by the diversion caused by the military coup, Tuareg rebels in the country's north launched incursions deeper into Mali, seizing towns and bases formerly held by government forces fighting the conflict that caused the coup. As military forces were engaged in consolidating their hold on the capital, the rebels were able to push southward with little opposition. According to the MNLA, Malian army forces retreated to Gao. 23 March The African Union suspended Mali, until \\"effective restoration of constitutional order is achieved without delay\\". Several African leaders said they had been in touch with the ousted Malian president and that he was still safe and under the protection of forces that remained loyal to him at an undisclosed location outside Bamako. During the day, there were fears by the rebels that the Red Berets were preparing a counterattack against the TV station, and rebel forces set up defensive positions to repel the expected assault. The TV network went off the air several times as gunfire erupted around the station. According to the BBC's West Africa correspondent, a large number of low-ranking soldiers, possibly the majority, supported the coup, while the majority of the army's officers had not come out publicly to support the coup. Captain Sonogo said in an interview with the BBC that \\"We are not here to confiscate any power but we are here to have an army and security forces available to assume the national security.... So once this has been fixed, I'll be able to say 'Ok, go for election' in a short period of time. I promise.\\" A joint African Union and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) diplomatic mission met representatives of the junta, according to Mali's state television service. A group of prominent Malian political figures made an announcement condemning the coup as \\"a step backwards\\", including presidential candidate Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta. Political parties that condemned the coup included the Alliance for Democracy in Mali, the Union for the Republic and Democracy, the Patriotic Movement for Renewal, the Union for Democracy and Development, the Union of Democratic Forces for Progress, the Solidarity and Progress Party, the Democracy and Justice Party, and the Party for Democracy and Progress. A total of 14 government officials and ministers were held hostage in the Kati military barracks outside Bamako. The Tuareg rebels and the Islamist rebel group Ansar Dine said they had surrounded Kidal. An official statement from the group read: \\"Thanks to Allah the Almighty and his blessings, we will soon take our land in Kidal.\\" 24 March Sanogo stated that no soldiers of the Malian army remained loyal to Tour√©, describing himself as \\"in total control\\". However, an anonymous source from Sanogo's staff stated that Tour√© continued to be protected by members of the parachute battalion that had formed his presidential guard. Meanwhile, The New York Times reported an observer describing the situation as \\"very fluid\\", and that rumours of a counter-coup continued throughout the day, exacerbated by the hour-long disappearance of the Malian television signal the previous night. A US State Department official also noted that Mali faced a \\"near-total cutoff of foreign assistance\\", on which the nation is heavily dependent. Following reports that men in police and military uniforms were looting shops and stealing cars in Bamako, Sanogo appeared on national television to denounce the \\"vandalism and pillaging\\" and state that the perpetrators were opposition forces impersonating soldiers in order to turn public opinion against the coup. Sanogo also announced his intention to seek peace talks with the Tuareg insurgents. According to Mali's state television service, Sanogo also met French ambassador Christian Rouyer along with several other foreign dignitaries. 25 March The Agence France-Presse reported the streets of Bamako were calm but largely deserted due to fears of looting and a petrol (gasoline) shortage. Many businesses remained closed, with Sanogo calling for them to reopen on Tuesday, 27 March. It was announced that ECOWAS heads of state were planning to hold an emergency meeting in Abidjan on the 27th, the day on which the junta had called for striking civil servants to return to work. A joint delegation from ECOWAS and the AU also began negotiations with the rebel soldiers to restore power to the elected government. Meanwhile, Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga, the detained foreign minister, and 13 other imprisoned officials announced their intention to begin a hunger strike. The stranded Kenyan and Zimbabwean foreign ministers were evacuated from Mali to Nigeria. 26 March The Barack Obama administration in the U.S. formally suspended aid to Mali, stating that it would only resume when democracy was restored. A thousand-person protest also gathered in Bamako to urge a return to democracy, chanting \\"Down with Sanogo\\" and \\"Liberate the ORTM\\" (Office de Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision du Mali). The Bamako-S√©nou International Airport was \\"partially\\" reopened for civilian transport. 27 March Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara called on an ECOWAS meeting in Abidjan to send a \\"strong signal\\" to the mutinous soldiers that democracy must be restored; he later described Mali's return to democracy as \\"non-negotiable\\". Kadre Desire Ouedraogo, the head of the ECOWAS commission, described the coup as \\"a threat to the entire region\\". Hundreds of Malian protesters demonstrated at the meeting, calling for a return to civilian rule. Following the meeting, ECOWAS placed peacekeeping troops on standby, hinting at possible military intervention. Businesses and schools reopened following a call by the CNRDR for them to do so. A spokesperson for the French embassy confirmed that Ambassador Christian Rouyer had spoken with Tour√© by telephone, and that Tour√© had stated that he was safe. The Tuareg rebellion dismissed calls by Sanogo for a cease-fire and continued its latest offensive. 28 March Amadou Toumani Tour√© said in an interview with French radio station RFI : \\"I am free and in my country.... The most important thing for me is not my own position. What is important is democracy, institutions and Mali.\\" Several thousand Malians took to the streets in the capital to show their support for the junta and reject \\"foreign interference\\" as the Economic Community of West African States said it was putting regional troops on standby for any necessary intervention. A violent clash took place at the Labour Exchange, which was serving as an opposition headquarters; a number of coup opponents were reportedly injured by thrown rocks and then arrested by police. Amnesty International called on the government to investigate the assaults and arrest the perpetrators. The CNRDR announced a new constitution. In one provision, the group pledged that it would not seek office in future elections, and that members of CNRDR would be barred from standing in elections. 29 March The five ECOWAS leaders abandoned their plans to visit Bamako mid-flight after several dozen junta supporters \\"stormed the airport runway\\". Their scheduled talks instead took place in Abidjan. ECOWAS announced later in the day that the junta had 72 hours to return power to constitutional authorities, or Mali would face the closure of its land borders and the freezing of its assets in ECOWAS member nations. Anti-Western sentiment was reported to rise in Bamako due to a perception that the U.S. and France were behind the proposed sanctions. A Radio France correspondent was detained by junta officers, handcuffed, and threatened with extrajudicial execution; he was released the following day. 30 March The MNLA announced its capture of the regional capital of Kidal, including a major military base. Sanogo called on Mali's neighbors to provide military aid to \\"save the civilian population and Mali's territorial integrity\\". Sanogo responded that he \\"understands\\" the ECOWAS position and reiterated his promise to hold elections, but refused to give a timetable. The New York Times reported that civil servants had been unable to resume work due to widespread looting by coup soldiers, including the theft of most government computers and the cash from safes. 31 March Gao, a northern regional capital, was taken by the MNLA and Ansar Dine. BBC News described the loss as \\"a serious blow to the coup leaders\\". Representatives of the CNRDR continued negotiations with ECOWAS under the mediation of President Blaise Compaor√© of Burkina Faso. 1 April Rebel forces were reported to have encircled Timbuktu, the last major Malian-controlled city of the Azawad. The city was captured later in the day. Meeting one of ECOWAS's demands, Sanogo announced that the CNRDR would reinstate Mali's previous constitution, and begin \\"to organise free, open and democratic elections in which we will not participate\\". 2 April After the junta failed to meet the ECOWAS deadline for relinquishing power, \\"severe\\" sanctions against Mali began. The nation's account in the Central Bank of West African States was frozen, and Mali's land borders were closed. As Mali imports most of its petroleum from C√¥te d'Ivoire, this was expected to cause parts of the country to run out of fuel \\"within days\\" as well as shutting down the country's gasoline-dependent electric grid. 3 April The UN Security Council began work on a resolution backing the ECOWAS sanctions against the junta. The U.S. and the African Union joined ECOWAS in announcing a travel ban on the coup's leadership. The junta announced that it was considering charging Tour√© with financial misconduct and treason. Sanogo also stated that a \\"national meeting\\" would be held on 5 April to decide \\"what will be best for the country in a consensual, democratic fashion\\". Insurgents in Northern Mali looted 2,354 tons of food from World Food Programme warehouses in Gao, Timbuktu, and Kidal causing the organization to suspend food aid to northern Mali. Looting of hospitals, hotels, government offices, and aid offices was reported across the region. Two hundred thousand people had reportedly fled the fighting. 4 April The UN Security Council stated \\"strong condemnation of the forcible seizure of power from the democratically-elected government\\" and again called for \\"the immediate restoration of constitutional rule... and for the preservation of the electoral process.\\" The coalition of Malian parties opposed to the junta refused to participate in Sanogo's proposed \\"national meeting\\". 5 April The fifteen nations of West Africa planned a military intervention against the junta and the Tuareg rebels. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that France would help \\"on a logistical level\\". An MNLA spokesman announced the end of the group's military operations after the capture of Douentza, which the group considered \\"the frontier of Azawad\\". 6 April The MNLA declared \\"irrevocably\\" the independence of Azawad from Mali. The African Union and the European Union condemned the declaration, the former declaring it \\"null and of no value whatsoever\\". Amnesty International described Mali as \\"on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster\\" following the coup and rebellion due to aid agency pull-outs, widespread looting, and widespread reports of violence against girls and women in the north. Later in the day, ECOWAS and the coup leaders reached an agreement on a transition of power and lifting of sanctions, under which National Assembly of Mali Speaker Dioncounda Traor√© would become interim president and oversee new elections. Under the terms of the agreement, the mutinying soldiers would be given amnesty for their participation in the coup. ==Aftermath== Tour√©'s resignation and later events 8 April Amadou Toumani Tour√© submitted his formal resignation from the presidency to ECOWAS mediators on 8 April 2012, stating, \\"More than anything, I do it out of the love I have for my country\\". Amadou Sanogo resigned shortly after. 9 April Mali's constitutional court met to determine the interim president, announcing that Dioncounda Traor√© can assume the presidency for up to 40 days in order to organize elections. 12 April Coup leaders formally handed power to Traor√©, and the imprisoned ministers and aides from Tour√©'s administration were released. Following Traor√©'s inauguration, he pledged to \\"wage a total and relentless war\\" on the Tuareg rebels unless they released their control of northern Malian cities. 17 April Mali state television announced that Cheick Modibo Diarra has been appointed interim prime minister to help restore civilian rule. 25 April The new civilian government comprising 24 ministers was announced; three ministers (defence, interior and internal security) were from the military and considered to be close to the coup leaders. Sanogo stated that the junta would continue to play a \\"supervisory\\" role in the transition. 29 April ECOWAS announced a deadline of a 12-month transition until presidential and legislative elections, and that soldiers would be deployed to Mali to ensure a peaceful transition. Sanogo stated that his government would reject both decisions. 30 April Following reports that the leaders of the \\"Red Berets\\" (presidential guard) would be arrested by the junta, Red Berets assaulted OTRM offices and other locations in Mali in an apparent attempt at a countercoup, exchanging fire with pro-junta soldiers. The fighting lasted through the night and resulted in at least 14 deaths and 40 injuries. The junta seized control of the primary base of anti-junta forces, ending the countercoup. The New York Times described the victory over the countercoup as \\"a further step in the consolidation of [the junta's] control\\". 2 May The junta announced that at least 140 Red Berets had been captured following the counter-coup attempt, although later reports put the number at 300, of which 20 died under torture.Mali Red Beret soldier shot dead 15 May ECOWAS released a statement accusing the junta of blocking the return to civilian rule and threatening to re-impose sanctions. 21 May Soldiers allowed a group of pro-coup demonstrators into Traor√©'s office in Bamako. The demonstrators, who had been carrying a mock coffin with Traor√©'s name written on it, attacked him, knocking him unconscious. He was brought to Point G Hospital but was not conscious when he was brought in, apparently suffering from a head injury. Three protesters were killed and others wounded when Traor√©'s security fired on the attackers. Unity government 20 August - unity government In an effort to restore stability to Mali following the military coup, a new government of national unity was formed on 20 August and approved by interim President Dioncounda Traor√©. Cheick Modibo Diarra, who led the interim government, remained as Prime Minister. The new cabinet consisted of 31 ministers, and five of those were viewed as close to the coup leader, Captain Sanogo. Those who were selected to five posts in the new government were chosen by the military leadership, while at least four members of the previous transitional government, including the interior minister who was responsible for organizing elections, were not changed. None of the selected ministers had close links to the ousted, democratically elected president. 10 December - Diarra arrest and resignation Following weeks in which he lost popular support and the backing of the High Islamic Council, Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra was arrested by soldiers on 10 December and taken to a military base in Kati. BBC News reported that the arrest had been ordered by Capt. Sanogo. According to an eyewitness, soldiers \\"smashed in the door of the prime minister's residence and took him away a bit violently\\". Hours later, the Prime Minister announced his resignation and the resignation of his government on national television. A military spokesman, Oumar Mariko, stated that Diarra had been seeking to \\"stay in power indefinitely\\", blocking the transition to democracy, and that he would be detained until a new prime minister was appointed by the president. The New York Times wrote that the resignation \\"appeared to be the country‚Äôs second coup\\". Mariko opposed the use of the term, telling reporters, \\"This is not a new coup d'etat\\". ==International reaction== In the days following the March coup d'√©tat, it was \\"unanimously condemned\\" by the international community. Intergovernmental organisations * : In New York, a UN spokesperson said U.N. Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon is following the event with 'deep concern' and called for calm and for grievances to be resolved peacefully and within the democratic process.

Kleiber joined the Animal Husbandry Department of UC Davis in 1929 to construct respiration chambers and conduct research on energy metabolism in animals. Among his many important achievements, two are especially noteworthy. In 1932 he came to the conclusion that the ¬æ power of body weight was the most reliable basis for predicting the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of animals and for comparing nutrient requirements among animals of different size. He also provided the basis for the conclusion that total efficiency of energy utilization is independent of body size. These concepts and several others fundamental for understanding energy metabolism are discussed in Kleiber's book, The Fire of Life published in 1961 and subsequently translated into German, Polish, Spanish, and Japanese. He is credited with the description of the ratio of metabolism to body mass, which became Kleiber's law. ==References *Max Kleiber Papers at Special Collections Dept., University Library, University of California, Davis Category:Swiss biologists Category:1893 births Category:1976 deaths Category:University of California, Davis faculty Category:20th-century biologists ","title":"Max Kleiber"},{"id":"35178547","text":"Pansy is an unincorporated community in Grant County, West Virginia, USA.

Suffrage performances lasted approximately from 1907-1914. Many suffrage plays called for a predominant or all female cast. Suffrage plays served to reveal issues behind the suffrage movement. These plays also revealed many of the double standards that women faced on a daily basis. Suffrage theatre was a form of realist theatre, which was influenced by the plays of Henrik Ibsen. Suffrage theatre combined familiar everyday situations with relatable characters on the stage in the style of realist theatre. ==Pro-suffrage plays== Suffrage dramas in favor of women's suffrage often portray strong female characters who illustrate the qualities of a rational, informed voters. They are meant to imply the obsolescence and inaccuracy of gender stereotypes that justified denying women the vote, such as separate spheres philosophy.Spender, Dale, and Carole Hayman, ed. How The Vote Was Won and Other Suffragette Plays. Methuen, 1986. 34-87. Print. Such characters often convince male or female anti-suffragists to revise their beliefs and support women's suffrage. Other plays satirize anti-suffragists as buffoons or narrow-minded individuals opposing progress. Many of these plays deliberately required few props and no sets. This was to allow amateur acting companies to perform the dramas at minimal cost, allowing them to be more widely performed and spread pro-suffrage sentiment. Due to the low cost of organizing a performance, suffrage plays were often performed in the drawing rooms of private residences and in small professional theaters.Finnegan, Margaret Mary. Selling suffrage: consumer culture & votes for women. Columbia University Press, 1999. Print. United Kingdom During the suffrage movement in the United Kingdom, eighteen short plays were published that have been coined women's suffrage dramaMaroula Joannou & June Purvis, The Women‚Äôs Suffrage Movement: New Feminist Perspectives (Manchester University Press, 1998), 127. but these represent only a few of the numerous plays with suffrage themes, the majority written in support of the Cause, that have been identified. Susan Croft's 'Chronology of Plays addressing or supporting Suffrage Issues 1907-1914' lists 170, a figure further supplemented by additional plays, discovered since publication, listed online. Elizabeth Robins's Votes for Women and Cicely Hamilton and Christopher St. John's How the Vote Was Won are two predominant examples of suffrage plays. Elizabeth Robins's Votes for Women was one of the first published women's suffrage plays. It was performed in 1907 at the Court Theatre in London.Hayman, Carole & Spender, Dale, How the Vote Was Won and Other Suffragette Plays, (London: Methuen, 1985), 36. Julie Holledge, British actor and director, wrote that Votes for Women ‚Äúheralded the beginning of a suffrage theatre‚Äù and assisted in organizing actresses and ‚Äútheir involvement with the women‚Äôs rights movement and their dissatisfaction with a male dominated theatre, these women had begun to develop a drama that could express the reality of women‚Äôs lives...With the emergence of the mass suffrage movement in the Edwardian era, over a thousand actresses were thrust into the fight for votes for women. Out of their struggle the first ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs theatre movement of the twentieth century was born.‚Äù Julie Holledge (as cited in How the Vote Was Won and Other Suffragette Plays, 1985) The characters in these plays were realistic, middle class characters fighting for or against women's suffrage. These plays often featured female characters talking with each other about the suffrage movement and often broke the boundaries between class. Suffrage plays led to the 1908 formation of the Actresses' Franchise League that ‚Äúprovided the infrastructure to promote women‚Äôs endeavors on a large scale.‚Äù Joannou, Maroula & Purvis, June, 136 Suffragists used plays to create changes in social attitudes. Attending a play was a social and community event, therefore their message reached a large audience in a short period of time. Some suffragists would say, ‚Äúa change in legislation was attributed to the production of one play.‚Äù Suffrage plays were a source of optimism for the female suffrage movement. Suffrage theatre gave prominence to women's roles and issues for the first time and greatly influenced the women's suffrage movement. Theatre played a crucial role in the United Kingdom women's suffrage movement. Pro-suffrage acting organizations such as The Actresses' Franchise League and Edith Craig's Pioneer Players formed alongside more political entities like the National Society for Women's Suffrage to campaign for the vote using drama and lectures. Only actresses were permitted to join the Actresses Franchise League. However, the AFL vowed to \\"assist all other [women's suffrage] Leagues wherever possible\\" by creating and performing \\"propaganda plays\\" and hosting informative lectures on the subject. The United Kingdom was home to many of the premiere suffragist playwrights, including Cicely Hamilton (author of Diana of Dobson'sCockin, Katharine. Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players 1911-25, Palgrave (2001)), George Bernard Shaw (Press Cuttings), Beatrice Harraden (Lady Geraldine's SpeechCrawford, E. The women's suffrage movement, a reference guide, 1866-1928. 1st ed. Psychology Press, 2002. Print.) and Bessie Hatton (Before Sunrise). Contemporary plays concerning the women's suffrage movement continue to be written and performed in Britain, such as Ian Flint's Woman (2003), Rebecca Lenkiewicz's Her Naked Skin (2008) and Sally Sheringham's The Sound of Breaking Glass (2009). British suffrage organizations and magazines also showed an interest in the position of women in India and suffrage performance in Britain included tableaux by Indian women, performed in Sloane Square, while Votes for Women reviewed plays like Tagore's Chitra. America Although many suffrage dramas were written by British authors and playwrights, a number of American writers contributed to the overall body of pro-suffrage plays. Many of these authors were well known in their own right: Charlotte Perkins Gilman authored the recently re- published Three Women, Something to Vote For, The Ceaseless Struggle of Sex: A Dramatic View, and the suffragist/World War I correspondent Inez Milholland composed If Women Voted. Organizations such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association viewed theatre as an effective way to spread pro-suffrage sentiment and provided suffrage dramas to professional and amateur theatres. Other American dramatists who contributed to the genre include Miriam Nicholson, Elizabeth Gerberding, Salina Solomon and Mrs. Charles Caffin. Although the suffrage drama movement didn't officially start until the early 20th century, there were similar plays being published by the late 19th century, such as Ella Cheever Thayer's Lords of Creation. Unfortunately many of the suffrage dramas circulated by the NAWSA have been lost, and the only evidence of their existence has been found in surviving order pamphlets for the plays. ==Anti-suffrage plays== Some of the earliest plays to address the question of women's suffrage were written in opposition to extending the vote. These plays satirized the notion of revised (and more equal) gender roles by portraying women as incapable of influence afforded to men or characterizing suffragists as \\"unwomanly\\" grotesques. Little research has been done into the prevalence or popularity of these anti-suffrage plays.Friedl, Bettina. On To Victory: Propaganda Plays of the Woman Suffrage Movement. Northeastern, 1990. Print. One notable example that transitioned from small parlor performances (like the pro-suffrage plays performed by amateur actors) to widespread popularity in the United States is The Spirit of Seventy-Six; or, The Coming Woman, A Prophetic Drama (1868) by Ariana Randolph Wormeley Curtis and Daniel Sargent Curtis. The play was written following the Civil War, as many abolitionists were beginning to shift their focus to different social issues, such as women's suffrage. The play is meant to be an absurdest fantasy depicting what life would be like if women and men traded gender roles. For example, women in the play wear men's clothing, smoke cigars, and hold all political offices while men struggle to tend to children in the home. The play implies that by enfranchising women they will all become horribly masculine, and suggests that radical suffrage activists campaign to \\"cover their own undesirability or incompetence\\". ==Influential British Suffrage Plays== *How the Vote Was Won by Cicely Hamilton and Christopher St John *Votes for Women by Elizabeth Robins *Lady Geraldine's Speech by Beatrice Harraden *A Chat with Mrs Chicky and Miss Appleyard's Awakening by Evelyn Glover *A Woman's Influence by Gertrude Jennings *The Apple by Inez Bensusan == References == *The Methuen Drama Book of Suffrage Plays - published 2013 - http://www.naomipaxton.co.uk/the-methuen-drama-book-of-suffrage-plays.html *Votes for Women and Other Plays - published 2009 - http://aurorametro.com/newsite/products-page/play-collections/votes-for-women/ == External links == * A surviving NAWSA pamphlet advertising suffrage plays for sale Category:20th century Category:Theatrical genres ","title":"Suffrage drama"},{"id":"35178596","text":"Acanthaster brevispinus, the short-spined crown-of-thorns starfish, is one of the two members of the starfish genus Acanthaster, along with the much better- known A. planci, the common crown-of-thorns starfish. ==Physical description== The body form of A. brevispinus is fundamentally the same as that of a typical starfish or seastar. Like A. planci, however, its distinctive traits include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed with multiple madreporites, flexible, prehensile, and densely spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass. Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm. In being multiple-armed, it has lost the five-fold symmetry (pentamerism) typical of starfish, although it begins with this symmetry in its life cycle. Acanthaster brevispinus is readily distinguished from A. planci in that it has: * dense blunt spines over the upper (aboral) surface of its disc * short pedicellaria on its aboral surface * purple-brown aboral surface becoming more intense along the arms * blotches of darker colour around the perimeter of the disc and along the arms, including a large blotch at the base of each arm * pale marks on the disc between each arm * spines along it arms which are not as long as in A. planci Image:Crown of Thorns Starfish at Malapascuas Island.jpgSpecimen photographed in the Philippines Image:Acanthaster brevispinus - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07041.JPGPreserved specimen at the Tokyo museum ==Taxonomy== A. brevispinus holotype, oral surface A. brevispinus was described by the American zoologist Walter Kenrick Fisher from a specimen collected at 18 m deep off Sirun Island, Sulu Archipelago, Philippines. The holotype is lodged in the U.S. National Museum, Washington, registration number USNM37027. Madsen (1955) reviewed the taxonomy of the genus Acanthaster and concluded that there were three species: the Indo-Pacific A. planci(L.); the short-armed, blunt spined eastern Pacific A. ellisii (Gray) and A. brevispinus Fisher. Madsen suspected that A. brevispinus was part of the variability of A. planci over its wide geographical range. See Acanthaster planci for a treatment of the status of Acanthaster ellisii. Subsequently, A. brevispinus was reported from the Great Barrier Reef region. Jangoux and Aziz reported a specimen from the Seychelles. They considered it sufficiently different from the holotype in some features to describe it as A. brevispinus seyshellesensis nov. subsp. ==Geographic distribution, habitat, and diet== The short-spined crown-of-thorns starfish has been reported from the Philippines (western Pacific Ocean, southeast Asia), Great Barrier Reef (western Pacific Ocean, eastern Australia) and the Seychelles (western Indian Ocean). These are widely separated locations and it is not possible to accurately describe the geographic distribution of this species, except it is broad and sympatric with a significant part of the distribution of A. planci. The locations are also within the tropics or subtropics. The highest latitude from which it has been collected is at the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef. All specimens have been collected from at least moderate depth: 18 m, 20+ m and 63 m in the Seychelles. A. brevispinus was not abundant at any of these localities, judging from the one or few collected, although this possibly is an artifact of the ways they were collected. Apparently, all were collected from soft substrates, not hard substrates like coral reef. Data are minimal on the benthic communities of which they are a part. The Great Barrier Reef specimens used by Lucas and Jones came as an incidental bycatch of trawling inshore of the Great Barrier Reef off Townsville in the central zone of the reef. They came from a sandy substrate. Two invertebrates were also collected in the trawls: the scallops Amusium balloti and A. pleuronectes. Scallops would seem to be difficult prey for slow-moving starfish with their rapid swimming by 'flapping' their valves and with 'eyes' on their mantle edges. In the laboratory, however, the starfish were able to trap unrestrained scallops. They slowly approached the scallop over its hinge, where they were less visible, so when the scallop detected the starfish, its movements were towards and under the starfish's disk, where it could be trapped. Only a portion of attempts at trapping scallops were successful. After trapping a scallop, the starfish fed and digested it while adopting a characteristic arched posture. A. brevispinus was fed commercial scallop meat as its standard laboratory diet, and they adopted the same arched feeding posture during feeding. This suggests scallops are a significant component of their normal diet, such that even the 'taste' of scallop meat triggers the distinct feeding behaviour. A. brevispinus, however, is quite omnivorous, at least according to observations in the laboratory. Distinctly hungry individuals of A. planci will feed on a range of animal tissue, including scallop meat, in the laboratory. However, they never arch during this feeding. ==Experimental hybridization with A. planci== F1 A. planci hybrid F1 A. brevispinus hybrid In 1973, Lucas and Jones conducted a hybridization experiment to investigate genetic relatedness between A. brevispinus and A. planci. Specimens of A. brevispinus were obtained by trawling in December of that year, near the approximate time of annual gamete release by A. planci in Great Barrier Reef waters. The A brevispinus had ripe gonads and it was possible to dissect out gonad tissue without killing the starfish and thus obtain mature eggs (oocytes) and sperm. Mature eggs and sperm were also obtained from A. planci. Eggs were fertilized in vitro with sperm. Four groups of larvae resulting from the fertilizations were reared, i.e. larvae of each species and reciprocal crosses. The A. planci eggs fertilized by A. brevispinus sperm will be referred to subsequently as A. planci hybrids and correspondingly A. brevispinus hybrids, according to the source of eggs. * A. brevispinus eggs X sperm * A. brevispinus eggs X A. planci sperm (A. brevispinus hybrids) * A. planci eggs X A. brevispinus sperm (A. planci hybrids) * A. planci eggs X sperm Fertilization rates were high for all gamete combinations, thus no evidence of gamete incompatibility between the species was noted. The larvae were reared according to the methods employed for A. planci and developed through the typical larval stages of bipinnaria and brachiolaria. Numbers of late-stage larvae were 10-29% of the original numbers of eggs, except for the A. brevispinus batch in which only a few normal late brachiolaria were seen. The subsequent development of the A planci batch and reciprocal hybrid batches followed the typical pattern of A. planci. There was settlement and metamorphosis into a five-armed starfish, 0.4‚Äì1 mm in diameter. They fed on encrusting algae. Many failed to develop normally, and six weeks after metamorphosis, 60 A. planci, 30 A. planci hybrids, six A. brevispinus hybrids, and no A. brevispinus starfish remained. It was impossible to distinguish the hybrids from A. planci during the early months of development, but when the hybrids were 200 mm in diameter, they were conspicuously different from this species. Hybrids showed intermediate features between the parent species. Spines were the immediately obvious feature, being intermediate in length between the species. In other features that distinguish A. planci and A. brevispinus, the hybrids were intermediate. The hybrids were variable, but no consistent differences were found between the two hybrids. Juvenile A. planci animals tended to have a 'bull's-eye' pattern on their aboral disks and this persisted in some adults. One of three adult A. brevispinus hybrids showed this pattern. None of the 12 adult A. planci hybrids showed it. None of the hybrids showed the pale marks between the bases of the arms that are characteristic of A. brevispinus. Of particular interest was the inheritance of scallop-trapping behaviour by both hybrids, although they did not arch their bodies as much as A. brevispinus during feeding on scallops, possibly because their arms were thicker than those of A. brevispinus and less appropriate for this posture. The hybrid starfish reached sexual maturity at the end of their second year (summer spawning season in the field). Further crosses were undertaken with these F1 generation hybrids to determine the extent to which gene flow through interbreeding could occur between the two species. Sexually mature male and female F1 A. brevispinus hybrids were not available and the crosses and reciprocal crosses were made with male and female F1 A. planci hybrids. * F1 A. planci hybrid eggs √ó A. planci sperm * A. planci eggs √ó F1 A. planci hybrid sperm * F1 A. planci hybrid eggs √ó A. brevispinus sperm * A. brevispinus eggs √ó F1 A. planci hybrid sperm * F1 A. planci hybrid eggs √ó sperm Although high fertilization rates were achieved again, without evidence of gamete incompatibility, survival was poor through early development and some morphological abnormalities occurred that had not been seen previously in batches of juvenile starfish. Introgression of genetic material broke down at this stage. ==References== Category:Acanthasteridae Category:Animals described in 1917 ","title":"Acanthaster brevispinus"},{"id":"35178599","text":"Founded in October 2008,Media men get lost in translation, Korea JoongAng Ilbo Daily, Mar. 1, 2010. 10 Magazine is an English language, \\"events-led\\"From backpacker to self-made media man, The Korea Herald, 2011-06-26 monthly magazine published in Seoul, South Korea.

In September of that year, they released a pre-launch issue, and October saw the official launch issue. The launch issue was released with congratulatory messages from many dignitaries and celebrities including: * the President and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce, * the Secretary General of the European Chamber of Commerce, * the Italian Ambassador to Korea * Korean celebrity Ahn Jae-wook * Model and entertainer Kim Ha-neul * Busan mayor Hur Nam-sik. * K-pop girl group Girls Generation (ÏÜåÎÖÄÏãúÎåÄ) After starting out in the Nonhyeon-dong offices of CEO Kim Sang-tae, the 10 Magazine offices have moved twice. They are now located in Suite 1010 of the Hannam Building (211 Itaewon-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, Korea). As of March 28, 2012, 10 Magazine went on sale in the App Store (iOS) and is now available worldwide through the 10 Magazine app.iTunes 10 Magazine App The app is also available in the Google Play store.Google Play 10 Magazine app In October 2012, the magazine replaced their original logo with the current one. ==Contests== 10 Magazine is associated with several annual contests, including its Korea Awaits Video Contest, held annually.Online Contests In 2010 the contest winner was Michael Aronson, who won a three-day trip to Tokyo, Japan, including round-trip tickets on Delta Air Lines and two nights' hotel stay at the Tokyo Hilton, while the 2011 winner, Fabien Tran Minh, won two round-trip tickets to Europe on Lufthansa. ==Events== 10 Magazine also co-sponsors the Foreigner's Day events with FC Seoul,KoreaBridge which bring together Seoul's international community to cheer on Seoul's football team. The first took place on September 11, 2010, with an estimated 3,000 non-Koreans in attendance and the second took place on September 24, 2011 and had approximately 7,000 non-Korean attendees. ==Associated Publications== The Weekly 10 is their weekly email service listing what their editors determine to be the best 10 events of the week. It is sent out every Thursday at 12noon. The 10 Magazine Korean Culture Podcast is a bi-weekly podcast which looks at current issues in Korea, tourist information, upcoming events and Korean culture itself. The hosts are Charles Montgomery, Paul Matthews and Danielle Sedlak.

In the PNN algorithm, the parent probability distribution function (PDF) of each class is approximated by a Parzen window and a non-parametric function. Then, using PDF of each class, the class probability of a new input data is estimated and Bayes‚Äô rule is then employed to allocate the class with highest posterior probability to new input data. By this method, the probability of mis- classification is minimized. This type of ANN was derived from the Bayesian network and a statistical algorithm called Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. It was introduced by D.F. Specht in 1966. In a PNN, the operations are organized into a multilayered feedforward network with four layers: * Input layer * Pattern layer * Summation layer * Output layer ==Layers == PNN is often used in classification problems.http://www.mathworks.in/help/toolbox/nnet/ug/bss38ji-1.html When an input is present, the first layer computes the distance from the input vector to the training input vectors. This produces a vector where its elements indicate how close the input is to the training input. The second layer sums the contribution for each class of inputs and produces its net output as a vector of probabilities. Finally, a compete transfer function on the output of the second layer picks the maximum of these probabilities, and produces a 1 (positive identification) for that class and a 0 (negative identification) for non-targeted classes.  Input layer  Each neuron in the input layer represents a predictor variable. In categorical variables, N-1 neurons are used when there are N number of categories. It standardizes the range of the values by subtracting the median and dividing by the interquartile range. Then the input neurons feed the values to each of the neurons in the hidden layer. Pattern layer This layer contains one neuron for each case in the training data set. It stores the values of the predictor variables for the case along with the target value. A hidden neuron computes the Euclidean distance of the test case from the neuron‚Äôs center point and then applies the radial basis function kernel function using the sigma values. Summation layer For PNN there is one pattern neuron for each category of the target variable. The actual target category of each training case is stored with each hidden neuron; the weighted value coming out of a hidden neuron is fed only to the pattern neuron that corresponds to the hidden neuron‚Äôs category. The pattern neurons add the values for the class they represent. Output layer The output layer compares the weighted votes for each target category accumulated in the pattern layer and uses the largest vote to predict the target category. == Advantages== There are several advantages and disadvantages using PNN instead of multilayer perceptron. * PNNs are much faster than multilayer perceptron networks. * PNNs can be more accurate than multilayer perceptron networks. * PNN networks are relatively insensitive to outliers. * PNN networks generate accurate predicted target probability scores. * PNNs approach Bayes optimal classification. ==Disadvantages == * PNN are slower than multilayer perceptron networks at classifying new cases. * PNN require more memory space to store the model. ==Applications based on PNN== * probabilistic neural networks in modelling structural deterioration of stormwater pipes.http://vuir.vu.edu.au/583/1/UrbanWater-Dung.pdf * probabilistic neural networks method to gastric endoscope samples diagnosis based on FTIR spectroscopy. * Probabilistic Neural Networks in Solving Different Pattern Classification Problems.http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj4(6)/3.pdf * Application of probabilistic neural networks to population pharmacokineties. * Probabilistic Neural Networks to the Class Prediction of Leukemia and Embryonal Tumor of Central Nervous System.http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1011984 * Ship Identification Using Probabilistic Neural Networks.http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2009/IMECS2009_pp1291-1294.pdf * Probabilistic Neural Network-Based sensor configuration management in a wireless ad hoc network. * Probabilistic Neural Network in character recognizing. * Remote-sensing Image Classification. == References == Category:Artificial neural networks ","title":"Probabilistic neural network"},{"id":"35179245","text":"Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c D∆∞∆°ng (born May 2, 1983 in Vietnam) is a Vietnamese footballer who is a midfielder for H·∫£i Ph√≤ng. == External links == * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Vietnamese footballers Category:Vietnam international footballers Category:V.League 1 players Category:Hoang Anh Gia Lai F.C. players Category:Hai Phong F.C. players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Footballers at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games competitors for Vietnam ","title":"Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c D∆∞∆°ng"},{"id":"35179355","text":"Kurper is a generic name for certain fish in South Africa.

It is endemic to New Zealand and can commonly be found throughout the country, and at any time of the year. It is New Zealand's largest damselfly, and only blue odonate. == Taxonomy == First description of Austrolestes colensonis. This species was first being described by Adam White in 1846. The first reference to this species was an illustration published under the name Agrion colensonis. In 1862 Edmond de S√©lys Longchamps wrote a description of the species and used the name Lestes colensonis. The New Zealand entomologist George Hudson described, discussed and illustrated this species in 1904 under the name L. colensonis. In 1913 Robin Tillyard placed this species within the genus Austrolestes. == Description == Markings of the male Austrolestes colensonis Female Austrolestes colensonis Austrolestes colensonis larvae Hudson described the species as follows: A. colensonis is the largest damselfly in New Zealand. Adult males can be distinguished by their widely separated blue eyes alongside a pale blue upper border on the mouthparts. The thorax has three metallic blue stripes separated by black, which is the predominant colour. Along the abdomen each segment from two to seven has a blue anterior ring located on the margin between segments; the remainder of the abdomen is black except for a dorsal blue area on segment ten. Females are similar to the male but with a thicker abdomen which has long thin appendages at the clubbed tip. Both females and young males are iridescent green in colour rather than blue. The larvae of this species are between 17 and 21 millimetres in length and have a broad head with large eyes, a cylindrical body shape and a rounded tip on the tail gill with no hairs, and three horizontal brown stripes. == Distribution == This species is found throughout New Zealand, including Stewart Island and Chatham Island; the Chatham Island individuals seem to be genetically distinct from the mainland population, and most have an interrupted blue stripe on the thorax, but currently this is thought insufficient to consider them a separate species. A. colensonis can be seen near water at any time, but especially November to April; adults seen in June and July may be overwintering. It is the main damselfly species in mountain tarns, so is presumably cold-tolerant. ==Life cycle== Mating pair of Austrolestes colensonis A. colensonis has a two-year life cycle. Some eggs hatch in the summer that they are laid while others overwinter and hatch the following spring. Those eggs that hatch in the following year overwinter in a dormant state. Temperature is the major influence that regulates the rate of development. Too low and it can cause the death of the embryo. Eggs can hatch in about 20‚Äì21 days where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius. Nymphs then live for a year to a year and a half before metamorphosis takes place. Before emergence, the nymphal darkens until it is nearly black in colour. The nymphs may take several short trips from the water a few days before emergence. Emergence normally takes place on rush or grass stalks 10‚Äì40 cm above the water line. It is common for there to be a high rate of mortality due to the moulting adult losing its grip on the substrate and ending up in a body of water where it can drown. Emergence occurs during the day from the months of October to February, with the majority bursting around January. However adults can be found at late as May in Dunedin and in early June in Northland. After emergence and maiden flight, young adults mature sexually for several days; during this time there can be quite a high number of dispersals. Once males reach maturity they venture out to find habitats suitable for breeding and to set their territories where they stay motionless on their established porch for extended periods of time until they are bothered by an intruder. Early afternoons, the height of reproductive activity, you will see males go chasing after females that fly through their territory. The mating \\"wheel\\" lasts for 10 minutes, and egg-laying generally occurs in tandem; the pair land on a floating piece of vegetation and the female drives a shaft through the stem and into the pith. She then lays 6‚Äì9 eggs, taking up to a minute. This is repeated and eggs are laid out either in close batches or spaced between one another. Once the nymphs, known as pronaiads, are hatched they begin to search for water so they can moult and release the second larval instar (about 2.3 mm long). These nymphs are quite active swimmers; once they reach a later stage they roam about on the surface of detritus and vegetation on the bottom of ponds. == Behaviour == Austrolestes colensonis at Ocean Grove, Dunedin, New Zealand The larvae are quite active due to their ability to perform jumping movements and when disturbed the larvae swim very rapidly with the legs held close to the body towards the bottom sediments in which it buries itself. They eat a range of prey including oligochaetes, rotifers, cyclopoids, copepods, ostracods, Chydorus sphaericus, Simocephalus vetulus elizabethae, water mites, Sigara species, Anisops species, damselfly larvae, and chironomid larvae. The larvae of A. colensonis are also cannibalistic. They catch other water insects by hiding amongst submerged vegetation and then ambushing their prey. A. colensonis has been found to show aggressive, agonistic behavior. Larvae remain still and sit in one spot for hours and are easily bothered by disturbance. Rowe observed captured larvae that were placed in aquariums where the larvae executed various forms of postures and motor patterns. The larvae were perched on two separate straws, one vertical, the other horizontal; each larvae defended their territory from the other organism. If larvae were put together in high numbers it was noted that they would lose legs or caudal lamellae on occasion in intraspecific interactions. Attacks that would occur sometimes resulted in the severing of a seized appendage, however there were no signs of predation after the event. As adults A. colensonis also exhibit thermoregulation behavior. There are two mechanisms involved: physiological colour changes and behavioural responses. They change in the intensity of their blue colouration. Males are pale blue-purple earlier on in the morning or after being cool for several hours. However, as they warm first the thorax then the abdomen become a brighter blue. Females that have warmed enough may also look bluish in colour. ==Predators, parasites, and diseases== The larvae of the New Zealand damselfly also have predators even though they are usually one of the more dominant species in their pooling area. The predators consist of fish and beetles that they hide from in weed and submerged vegetation. Humans also contribute significantly to New Zealand damselfly survival with their power to redirect streams, leaving dry ponds with larvae unable to survive and eggs unable to hatch. Natural events, such as droughts, can also cause ponds and streams to dry up with similarly deadly results for larvae and eggs. ==References *iNaturalist identification guide Category:Lestidae Category:Odonata of New Zealand Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand Category:Insects described in 1846 Category:Taxa named by Adam White (zoologist) ","title":"Austrolestes colensonis"},{"id":"35179495","text":"Athletic Union of Zakaki () is a Cypriot football club based in Zakaki, Limassol.

The burrows are usually stocked with orb-spiders, mainly Meta and Araneus spp. although Lycosidae may also be predated. The prey are temporarily hung on a nearby plant whilst the burrow is dug. Some females steal the prey captured by its neighbour and females will even fight for the possession of another female's prey, i.e. kleptoparasitism. Eventually some females learn to steal the spiders in the burrow, either by driving away the rightful owner while she was sealing up the burrow, or by hunting through the soil around the aggregated burrows to find sealed burrows. . In Britain the flight period of adults is June to August. Both sexes of Episyron rufipes are often seen visiting the flowers of umbellifers for nectar. Episyron rufipes nests are parasitised by the Spider Wasp Evagetes pectinipes. the female of which eats the egg of Episyron and then replaces it with her own egg before the nest is resealed.

His mother was a daughter of Simon Ockley, the historian of the Saracens. After receiving instruction from his father, and studying at Chesterfield grammar school, he entered Jesus College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1744, and M.A. in 1748. In March 1748, Heathcote became curate of St Margaret's Church, Leicester, and vicar of Barkby in 1749. His publications attracted the notice of William Warburton, who presented Heathcote to the assistant preachership at Lincoln's Inn. He moved in June 1753 to London, where he associated with John Jortin, Thomas Birch, Matthew Maty, and others, who met once a week to drink coffee and talk learnedly. In the late 1760s Heathcote moved back to the midlands, as a prebendary of Southwell Minster, Nottinghamshire. He became preoccupied with duties as a magistrate, though he continued to visit London for a decade or more. He became vicar-general of the peculiar of Southwell in 1788, and died on 28 May 1795. ==Works== In 1746 Heathcote published a Latin dissertation on the history of astronomy, Historia Astronomi√¶ sive de ortu et progressu astronomi√¶. When in 1752 he wanted to take a part in the controversy set off by Conyers Middleton on the miraculous powers ascribed to the early Christian Church, he felt a lack of fluency in literary English. He produced two pamphlets anonymously: Cursory Animadversions on the Controversy in General (1752), and Remarks upon a Charge by Dr. Chapman (1752); and in the following year wrote a reply to Thomas Fothergill's sermon on the uses of commemorating King Charles I's martyrdom. He took a part in controversy against Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, publishing in 1755 A Sketch of Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy,‚Äô and against the Hutchinsonian Thomas Patten on the other. His tracts formed the basis of his dissertation on occasion of his D.D. degree at Cambridge in 1759, and of his Boyle lectures, 1763‚Äì5. In 1761, he became one of the main writers in the Biographical Dictionary of 1761. In 1767, Heathcote published an anonymous letter to Horace Walpole on the dispute between David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which was attributed to Walpole himself. In 1771, he published anonymously The Irenarch, or Justice of the Peace's Manual; the third edition bore the author's name. The second and third editions have a long dedication to Lord Mansfield. In 1786, he produced a miscellany of anecdotes and dissertations, Sylva. ==Family== Heathcote in August 1750 married Margaret Mompesson, a descendant of William Mompesson of Eyam, and attained financial independence. ==References== ;Attribution ==On- line edition of works== *A Sketch of Lord Bolingbroke's Philosophy- free online version digitized by The Royal Library Copenhagen Category:1721 births Category:1795 deaths Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:English biographers Category:English lexicographers Category:People from Barrow upon Soar ","title":"Ralph Heathcote"},{"id":"35179616","text":"Per Johan Alstr√∂m (born 9 April 1961) is a Swedish Professor of ornithology.

Phase two of the project is located on the Kaheawa Ridge at the 1800‚Äì2700 foot elevation, just southeast of KWP I. ==Background== The first wind project was proposed in 1996. Zond Pacific installed a series of six anemometers in the area to collect and study wind data. The project was developed by several companies before UPC Wind Partners, LLC and Makani Nui Associates, LLC formed a partnership.

The plan helps fund conservation efforts for four protected species, including three endemic birds and one endemic bat: the Hawaiian goose (nene), the Hawaiian petrel (uau), the Hawaiian shearwater (ao), and the Hawaiian hoary bat (opeapea).The Maui News 2010; Kaheawa Wind Power, p. 6 The project is also researching how to best protect the nesting areas of seabirds. The initial construction of the wind farm required restoration efforts for several plant species in the area. More than 24,000 native plants were eventually restored, comprising species such as Dodonaea viscosa (aalii), Metrosideros polymorpha (≈åhia lehua), Bidens micrantha (kookoolau), Wikstroemia oahuensis (akia), and Heteropogon contortus (pili).Wireless News 2011 The habitat also includes Sida fallax (ilima), Sophora chrysophylla (mƒÅmane), Lycopodiella cernua (wƒÅwaeiole), and two invasive species, Leucaena leucocephala (koa haole) and Cenchrus ciliaris.Starr, Plants of Hawaii; Kaheawa Wind Power 2006, p. 14, 16 In September 2015, SunEdison discovered that the turbines were killing more hoary bats than had been predicted in the initial ecological review.Wind turbines killing more hoary bats than expected.

Then came the Chase-directed 'Made in America,' which miraculously restored Journey's street cred and created the kind of zeitgeist moment that wasn't supposed to be possible anymore in a fragmented, 600-channel cable universe.

From 1797 until his death, he was also titular Prince of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken, however, Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken was occupied by France during that period. He was born in Usingen, the eldest son of Prince Charles of Nassau-Usingen and his wife, Christina Wilhelmina, the daughter of Duke John William III of Saxe-Eisenach. In 1770, Charles William became Lieutenant-General in the Dutch army. In 1789, he was promoted to general and in 1790 to colonel of the Walloon regiment and captain of the grenadiers. In 1775, he succeeded his father as Prince of Nassau-Usingen. In 1783, he concluded a treaty of inheritance with the princes of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken, Nassau-Weilburg and Nassau-Dietz (i.e., Orange-Nassau), in which it was agreed that the Nassau lands were indivisible and that mutual succession among the various branches based on primogeniture would be observed. In 1797, Prince Henry Louis of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken died childless and Charles William inherited his principality. However, under the Treaty of Lun√©ville, the territories on the left bank of the Rhine were lost to France. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803 compensated Charles William with territories taken from the Electorate of Mainz, the Electorate of Cologne, Electorate of the Palatinate and Hesse.

Championship events have been held since 1968, and there is a long pedigree involving 1600cc Ford Kent engined cars. By the mid-80s the FF1600 category was regarded as a mainstay of Scottish motor- racing. Despite variations in the format of the race meetings over the years, the Formula Ford class has remained popular among drivers. Several drivers have progressed to professional racing careers after gaining experience at this entry level. Over the years, races have been held at Ingliston Motor Racing Circuit, near Edinburgh and the Knockhill Racing Circuit in Fife. The events are organised by the Scottish Motor Racing Club as part of meetings where the programme features a range of categories. In the early 1980s the races were watched by crowds that were 6000 strong. In 2013 the races have crowds of around 3,000 spectators recorded. ==History== Since the championship was established in the 1960s, many competitors have had their performance at these events noticed, and gone on to race in higher level competitions, including Formula one. The championship has allowed competitors to be tested at faster speeds than karting, with vehicles able to reach a top-speed of 140 mph, compared to the kart‚Äôs 80 mph. Events were initially held at the Ingliston Motor Racing Circuit but this track ceased to be used for regular motor sport events in 1992. Popular chassis for these events have included those manufactured by Crossl√© and Van Diemen. In 1985 the championship saw the debut of Scotland‚Äôs first home-built racing car, the ‚ÄúRotor‚Äù. The Rotor-Motive team continued to compete in the championship and were Scotland's only full- time professional racing manufacturer. ==Championship format== In 2014 there are two classes - one for current cars and another for older 'Classic' cars built before 31 December 1989. There is also a Newcomers Cup which is open to drivers in their first or second year of open wheel competition. In 2014 there were 15 rounds of racing. In one of the final rounds of the championship, competitors are also racing for the David Leslie Trophy named in memory of Scottish BTCC driver. The Angel Burgue√±o Trophy is awarded to the driver who completes the fastest lap. Action from the races has been screened by Sky and Virgin Media channel Motors TV. ==Champions== In 1969 Tom Walkinshaw won the championship in a Hawke DL2. then moved on to race in Formula 3. After winning a few Scottish motocross titles, Stewart Roden then won the Scottish Formula Ford Championship five times. This led to him being offered a place in Eddie Jordan's F3 team in 1988, although he only drove once before being left unable to continue as he had run out of money. In 2011, Ken Thirlwall, was the first person to win every race of the season, also winning the championship in only his 2nd Formula Ford season. In 2014, Ciaran Haggerty became Scotland‚Äôs youngest ever Formula Ford champion.https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/january-2015/98/ciaran- haggerty Haggerty had enjoyed the support of the retired racing driver Dario Franchitti.

It deals with a life of a merchant, not any kings. Though the biography is not historically accurate and eulogies Jagadu, it is good sources of information about trade and influence of traders of that era. Other sources include Upadesha Tarangini by Ratnamandiragani. ==Ancestors== Viyatthu was a Shrimali Jain who are originated from Shrimal in southern Marwad (now Bhinmal, Rajasthan). Shrimalis are also mentioned in some 11th-century inscriptions. His son Varanaga lived in Kanthkot in eastern Kutch then under Chaulukya rule. Varanaga's grandson was Visala. Visala's son Solaka or Solasha moved from Mandvi to Bhadreshwar with his wife Sri. They had three sons; Jagadu, Raja and Padma. ==Life== Vasai Jain Temple, Bhadreshwar. Rebuilt after old temple was destroyed in 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Goddess Harshad Temple on Koyal hill is accredited to Jagadu. After death of his father, Jagadu inherited business and became undertook responsibility of his family. He married Yashomati and also got his brothers married. Several legends attribute his wealth to magical events. In one legend, he was given a magical object by a shepherd which made him rich and so his philanthropic activities expanded. As Jagadu had no child, his wife advised him to pray to gods. The god of ocean had granted him boon that though he will not have children, his ships will always reach ports safely. Another legend explains that one of his assistant Jayantsimha of Upakesha lineage had acquired a stone during his stay for trading at Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. A Shaivaite Yogi told Jagadu to split open it and so he found jewels when he split it. He owned many ships, which he used to travel west to Persia, Arabia and Africa. He traded mainly in grains, cotton and spices. He had a vast maritime trade empire. He was involved in some political conflicts too and saved his town. Pithadeva, probably the Soomra chief of Para invaded Kutch and destroyed the town wall of Bhadreshwar. Jagadu started rebuilding the walls so he was warned by messenger from Pithadeva. The messenger had told, \\"When two horns grow on the head of an ass, then thou will erect here a town wall!\\" He refused to stop rebuilding and visited Lavanaprasada, the Vaghela general at Anhilwad Patan under Bhima II of Chaulukya dynasty. He asked for help and he received an army from him and Pithadeva had to retreat to Para. Jagadu completed building the town wall and sent Pithadeva an obscene statue of his mother and an ass with golden horns. This also won him approval of Samma Jam, a Samma chief of Sindh and opponent of Pithadeva. Samma Jam sent gifts to Jagadu. He invited the Jain teachers to town. Following advise of his teacher Paramdeva Suri of the Purnima Gaccha, he also led pilgrimages of Jain community to Jain holy sites such as Shatrunjaya and Girnar after taking permission of new Vaghela chief Visaladeva. After returning, he built and renovated several Jain temples and consecrated images. He is also accredited to have rebuilt and repaired the historic Vasai Jain temple at Bhadreshwar. His some notable constructions between 1250-70 CE are Rishabha temple at Dhanka, a temple with 24 devkulikas at Wadhwan, a temple on Shatrunjaya hill and a temple with 52 devakulika at Sevadi. He built wells, gardens, tanks, rest houses and a hospital. He had spent his fund to built some Hindu temples also and restored a Shaivaite temple. He had also built a masiti (a mosque) for Shimali or Khimli (identified as Ismailis) in Bhadreshwar for Muslim traders. There is still a mosque associated with Ismailis in Bhadreshwar and is considered as one of the earliest Islamic monument in India. He is accredited for building a Hindu temple of goddess Harshad or Harsiddhi on Koyal hills near old port town of Miyani near Porbandar. His statue is also placed on the right side of the goddess in the temple. The legend associated with temple goes like this: The temple of goddess was on the hill overlooking the creek. It was believed that if the eyesight of goddess fell on the ship, it would be burnt or wrecked in the sea. The fleet of ships of Jagadu wrecked due to it but he was saved. Jagadu went to the temple and observed fast for three days to please the goddess. She appeared and Jagadu persuaded her to descend the hill so her eyes do not fall on ships. She agreed to acceded to his request if he would sacrifice a buffalo each step leading down the hill. Jagadu was perplexed as being follower of Jainism, he believed in non-violence. To keep his words, Jagadu brought buffaloes and sacrificed but the number fell short and the goddess was still few steps away from the new temple site. So he decided to sacrifice himself and his family. The goddess pleased for his devotion his family was brought back to life. She also granted boon that his line wold not extinguished. A Jain monk Deva Suri, apprised Jagadu of a famine, which will strike after a few years and instructed him to store grains for such an event and spend his wealth for benefit of people. Jagadu stored large amount of grains. After two years of famine, the royal granaries were exhausted and the prices of grains rose to one dramma for thirteen grains of gram. Jagadu was summoned to court by Visaladeva and asked about his 'seven hundred well filled granaries'. Jagadu told that he had stored the grains for the poor and declared that if the people of starvation, it would his sin. He gave 8000 mutakas (measure) of grains to Visaladeva. He also supplied 12000 mutakas grains to Hammira, the ruler of Sindh; 18000 to king Madanavarmana of Avanti; 21000 to the Garjanesha Mojadina of Delhi; 32000 to Pratapasimha of Kashi and 12000 to king Skandhila. He also helped people by providing grains for three years from 1256 to 1258 CE (Vikram Samvat 1313 to 1315). After famine ended, he was visited by Nagada, the minister of Visaladeva. Then the horses were precious commodity and they were imported from the Persian Gulf at the great cost, mostly for military use. One ship carrying horses shipwrecked near Bhadreshwar coast and only one horse survived and reached the coast. The horse had a paper attached to his neck with name of Jagadu on it. The horse was claimed by Nagada as a royal property which was contested by Jagadu and claimed as his own. It is a testimonial to his influence. His biography ends with death of Jagadu. His funeral was attended by royals. He had adopted a son. Champsi, a renowned merchant during reign of Mahmud Begada, was his descendant. ==Legacy== He is continued to be known for his philanthropy especially during famine. Several Gujarati plays depicting events from his life are produced. There is a shrine and memorial stone dedicated to him at Bardai Brahmin Dharmashala (rest house) in Jhundala near Porbandar. There is a ruined tower on the opposite bank of Aji River near Rajkot which is attributed to him. A locality in Ghatkopar suburb of Mumbai is named Jagdusha Nagar after him. ==References== Category:Indian philanthropists Category:Gujarati people Category:People from Kutch district Category:13th-century Indian Jains Category:Indian merchants Category:History of Kutch ","title":"Jagadu"},{"id":"35180015","text":"Glaucocharis euchromiella is a species of moth in the family Crambidae described by √âmile Louis Ragonot in 1895.

Providentially, only a few passengers were travelling on car 41 that day, and they came out of the ordeal unscathed, but the driver, who was new to the job, sustained some injury. ==Closure== The tramway service closed on 27 March 1937 but the company continued to supply electrical power to the district for domestic and commercial consumption. ==References * Margate Museum Factsheet: The Isle of Thanet Tramway System 1901‚Äì1937 * Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways at the British Tramway Company Badges and Buttons website Category:Tram transport in England Category:Margate Category:Ramsgate Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in England ","title":"Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways and Lighting Company"},{"id":"35180247","text":"A Khambo Lama (; ; ) is the title given to the senior lama of a Buddhist monastery in Mongolia and Russia.

Apart from one appearance for Valencia in La Liga, he spent his entire career as a player and manager in the lower divisions, totalling 52 goals in 246 Segunda Divisi√≥n B games in service of five clubs. In 2004, Mir started working as a coach. ==Playing career== Born in Meliana, Valencian Community, Mir was a youth product of local giants Valencia CF. After several seasons as a senior with the reserves he started his professional career with Palam√≥s CF in the second division, on loan. Upon his return to the Che for the 1991‚Äì92 campaign, Mir was again almost exclusively associated with the B-side. Main squad manager Guus Hiddink handed him his La Liga debut on 8 September 1991, and he played 31 minutes in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Albacete Balompi√© after coming on as a substitute for Rommel Fern√°ndez. Mir spent the remainder of his career in the Spanish lower leagues, competing almost exclusively in his native region and representing mainly Elche CF (three seasons). He retired at the end of 2001‚Äì02 with Villajoyosa CF, in the fourth level. ==Coaching career== Mir was appointed director of youth football at Benidorm CF in 2002, remaining in the position several years. Afterwards, he took the reins of Alicante CF's reserves, promoting from the regional championships in his first year and nearly achieving the feat the following campaign, with a team full of youngsters. For 2010‚Äì11, Mir joined Valencia B, leading the club to the third division at the first attempt. He was relieved of his duties in December 2011, having recorded four wins, four draws and nine defeats during the season. In 2012, Mir moved to fellow reserve team Elche CF Ilicitano, and in his first season he led them to a historic promotion to division three. The following campaign they went unbeaten at home, but lost the play-off place to UE Llagostera on the last day, and he was sacked following relegation in May 2015. Mir returned to the city of Alicante on 18 January 2016, being hired by third-tier club H√©rcules CF on 18 January 2016. He was dismissed on 27 June after defeat to C√°diz CF in the play-off final. Mir was appointed by third level strugglers Real Murcia on 26 February 2017, replacing the fired Paco Garc√≠a. After guiding them to the playoffs he switched to Elche on 15 June, who dismissed him five months later. On 30 May 2018, Mir was named CD Alcoyano manager. He left the following 27 February by mutual consent, when a 4‚Äì1 loss at fellow strugglers CD Teruel put the team one point off the relegation play-offs. Mir returned for a second spell at H√©rcules on 9 December 2019, replacing Jes√∫s Mu√±oz who had been fired earlier the same day. He lasted only until the following 11 February when, within 24 hours of a public vote of confidence from the board, he was dismissed from a team five points adrift in the relegation places. ==Managerial statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Managerial record by team and tenure - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"Nat !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"8\\"Record !rowspan=2 - ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! - align=leftTorrellano  align=left1 July 2005 align=left30 June 2007  - align=leftAlicante B  align=left1 July 2007 align=left30 June 2009  - align=leftValencia B  align=left1 July 2010 align=left13 December 2011  - align=leftElche B  align=left6 June 2012 align=left21 May 2015  - align=leftH√©rcules  align=left18 January 2016 align=left27 June 2016  - align=leftMurcia  align=left26 February 2017 align=left15 June 2017  - align=leftElche  align=left15 June 2017 align=left13 November 2017  - align=leftAlcoyano  align=left30 May 2018 align=left27 February 2019  - align=leftH√©rcules  align=left9 December 2019 align=left11 February 2020  - !colspan=\\"4\\"Total !‚Äî } ==ReferencesCategory:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Horta Nord Category:Spanish footballers Category:Valencian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n B players Category:Tercera Divisi√≥n players Category:Valencia CF Mestalla footballers Category:Palam√≥s CF footballers Category:Valencia CF players Category:Elche CF players Category:CD Alcoyano footballers Category:Yeclano CF players Category:Benidorm CF footballers Category:Villajoyosa CF footballers Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n B managers Category:Elche CF Ilicitano managers Category:H√©rcules CF managers Category:Real Murcia managers Category:Elche CF managers Category:CD Alcoyano managers ","title":"Vicente Mir"},{"id":"35180298","text":"Vernon, France The Tour des Archives is the keep of a former castle in the commune of Vernon in the Eure d√©partement of France.

Leading conservative women such as Phyllis Schlafly have expressed that women should embrace their privileged essential nature. This thread of belief can be traced through the anti-suffrage movement, the Red Scare, and the Reagan Era, and is still present in the 21st century, especially in several conservative women's organizations such as Concerned Women for America and the Independent Women's Forum. ==History== Anti-suffragism Women first began to oppose suffrage in Massachusetts in 1868. They succeeded in blocking the proposal, and this caused the movement to gain momentum. The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage (NAOWS) was thus formed by Josephine Dodge in 1911 with approximately 350,000 members. This organization mostly consisted of wealthy women who were often wives of politicians. These women helped defeat nearly 40 suffrage proposals, and published the Women's Protest in order to voice their agenda nationwide. Dodge and the organization argued that women should stay out of politics in order to be more efficient and diligent in \\"work for which her nature and her training fit her.\\" These anti-feminist beliefs are what shaped the anti-suffrage crusade.  Goldwater campaign  A major source of conservative women's activism was in Southern California in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in Orange County, California. These women mainly consisted of \\"suburban warriors,\\" or middle class housewives who feared that their Christian nation was under attack. Increasing Cold War tensions and fears of Communism allowed for these women to mobilize groups such as the John Birch Society and the American Civil Liberties Union to pursue their political agendas. They eventually backed politician Barry Goldwater and successfully campaigned for him to become the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 1964. However, Goldwater lost the national election to Lyndon Johnson in a landslide. Still, his nomination illustrated the shift from moderation to more hardline stances in many members of the Republican Party. His campaign also showcased the success of conservative grassroots organizations and mobilization.  Reagan Era  After Goldwater's defeat, grassroots conservatives had to rethink their strategy. Thus, conservative women soon turned to Ronald Reagan. He won over the support of the women of Orange County and successfully unified the party when he was elected Governor of California in the 1966 election. However, there were some women that opposed him due to his more mainstream views. Cyril Stevenson, a prominent leader of the California Republican Assembly, sought to undermine his candidacy. These attempts failed, nevertheless, as Reagan was elected. However, a significantly lower number of women than men voted for Reagan when he was eventually elected President of the United States. Reagan gained the support of more conservative women by attempting to close this \\"gender gap.\\" He enacted equal rights policies attempting to end discrimination laws. Still, Reagan's election showed that the new Republican majority, although still coined \\"mainstream,\\" was now built on anti-liberalism and contained more conservative views, and conservative women activists like the women of Orange County played a very important role in that shift.  Mama grizzlies  The term \\"mama grizzlies\\" originated from Sarah Palin's endorsement of female candidates in the 2010 primaries, whom she gave this title to. \\"Mama grizzly\\" was officially coined in Palin's May 2010 speech for the Susan B. Anthony List Pro-Life group, and it was later used in Palin's own advertisements. This description is used to describe conservative women who wish to play an active role in politics, whether it be through running for office or through campaigning for conservative ideas and topics. These women also refer to themselves as Susan B. Anthony feminists, agreeing with the ideas that Anthony argued for such as political activism but not the feminist ideas more modern than those, such as the pro-choice movement. Because this term originated from Palin's endorsement and was used in Palin's advertisements, it has been linked to her and the Tea Party, which she hass affiliated with. These \\"mama grizzlies\\" are self- proclaimed conservative feminists, with Palin herself publicly identifying as a feminist in 2008. In the spread of this new classification for women, where women's advocacy took on a unique form, Palin called for a rise of a new breed of feminism, and this idea quickly came to popularity among right-wing women. Critics of the \\"mama grizzly\\" viewpoint do not agree that Palin's ideas are feminist, since they do not support most traditionally feminist values, such as women's right to abortion. Palin's viewpoint has been opposed by socially liberal feminists, with some such as Jessica Valenti claiming that this angle was used to take advantage of the success of feminists like Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential election. Other complaints draw from the group's denial of systemic sexism and oppression due to gender, with critics believing that \\"mama grizzly\\" ideals could not be labeled as feminist if they were to dismiss these matters. ==In 21st century politics==  Michele Bachmann  Michele Bachmann unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for president in the 2012 election. Although Bachmann attempted to utilize conservative views that appeal to the Tea Party movement, the media's coverage of her was very different from her male candidates. The media instead focused on her migraines, her marriage, and her hair and makeup style choices. However, her campaign started strongly, as she performed well in the first presidential debate and soon led in the primary polls. Bachmann was forced to drop out of the race after her poor performance in the Iowa caucuses. Still, many conservative women continue to support her, and this support along with that of Sarah Palin in 2008 shows that conservatives now seriously consider women for major political roles. Bachmann's run also sparked the debate of women's role in politics and public policy, and whether or not gender roles should be reexamined. Carly Fiorina  Carly Fiorina  Carly Fiorina began as a successful businesswoman, becoming the CEO of Hewlett-Packard in 1999. However, Fiorina was fired from her position in 2005 due to a number of factors such as economic conditions, operational failures, gender bias, and questionable ethics. Fiorina turned to politics and won the Republican nomination for senator of California in 2010, but lost to incumbent democrat Barbara Boxer. She quickly gathered acclaim from the Republican base, and was appointed chair of the American Conservative Union Foundation in 2013. In 2015, she announced her candidacy for President of the United States. Although she was the only viable female candidate in the Republican primary, she was reluctant to indulge in gender politics, due to both her conservative and corporate personas. Fiorina dropped out of the race in February 2016 to endorse Ted Cruz, and soon became his running mate. Sarah Palin  Sarah Palin  In 2010, Sarah Palin, whose nomination to run for Vice President with Republican presidential candidate John McCain was a visible ascent of a conservative woman in 2008, declared a new voice for those women and supported many women for Congress whom she labeled \\"Mama Grizzlies.\\" Many supported Palin because of her stances against abortion and other issues that defy feminists; her \\"soccer mom\\" persona also was very appealing. Palin and McCain eventually lost the general election. == Notable figures == Ann Coulter  Ann Coulter  As a political commentator, Ann Coulter has written numerous books and columns, and often appears as a political commentator on conservative television, she is one of the most recognizable and influential voices for conservative women today, as she has started many conservative political trends such as the continual critique of mainstream liberalism.  Phyllis Schlafly  Phyllis Schlafly As a conservative, Phyllis Schlafly argued that the female gender is actually privileged, and that women have \\"the most rights and rewards, and the fewest duties.\\" She advocated for women to stay out of politics and the workplace. She argued against feminists and claimed that they actually take away rights from women. She thus led the opposition against the Equal Rights Amendment, and successfully prevented the amendment from being ratified by the required number of states before the ratification deadline set by the Congress. Schlafly argued that the amendment stripped women of what she saw as their special \\"privileges.\\" She saw it as anti-Christian and argued that it promoted policies such as abortion, sex education, and LGTBQ rights. She also claimed that it would give power to federal courts and take power away from the states.

The ideology falls under that of social conservatism. Their agenda includes stopping the \\"decline in moral values of our nation,\\" restricting access to pornography, defunding the United Nations, defining the definition of family as heterosexually led, opposing abortion, and advocating for prayer in schools. The CWA promotes anti-feminist ideologies, such as a woman's primary role is that of a mother and homemaker, while simultaneously engaging in identity politics in order to attempt to prove this.  Independent Women's Forum  The Independent Women's Forum is an organization based more in fiscal conservatism. Unlike the CWA, their agenda includes opposition to the Violence Against Women Act, supporting the war in Iraq and women's rights there, challenging feminist professors on college campuses, opposing affirmative action, and other fiscal conservative policies. However, IWF is more based in libertarianism than the Republican Party since they strive for economic freedom. Similarly to CWA, IWF also engages in identity politics in order to attract career women to their organization; they advocate. IWF is relatively small at 1,600 members, but is constantly growing and thriving.  Other organizations  * Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute * Eagle Forum * Network of enlightened Women * Susan B.

He was also a journalist, a member of the Goa Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet Minister in the Government of Goa with portfolios of Tourism as well as Science and Environment. ==Early life and education== Matanhy was born on 24 October 1948, to Jacinto de Saldanha and Maria Alacoque Viegas in Carmona, Goa. He studied at various schools, and studied at the S. Tomas School in his native village of Cansaulim. He later pursued higher studies in Christ College, Bangalore, where, aged around 17, he would share the money sent to him by his father with the poor, and teach them ways to be self-sufficient. He also studied in Belgaum. Matanhy had a degrees in Science and Education. He also obtained a master's degree in Arts (Political Science) from the Bombay University (now, University of Mumbai) in 1988. ==Social activism== Besides being a teacher at the Don Bosco High School in Panjim from around June 1974/5 to October 2008, Matanhy also took up the causes of the poor and downtrodden. In the 1970s, Matanhy campaigned for the Ramponnkars, (traditional fisherman of Goa) to prevent trawlers from fishing within 50 metres of the shore. He formed the Goenchea Ramponnkarancho Ekvott (Association of Goa's Traditional Fisherfolk) and helped stop the discharge of effluents from the Zuari Agro Chemicals factory into the Arabian Sea, near Velsao. The pollution was killing fish, the staple food of Goans. This was free India's first industrial pollution protest. It led to a central act regulating pollution. In the late 1970s, with Urbano Lobo and others, he campaigned against the destruction, for mining, of the sand dunes on the beaches of Goa. Matanhy was also associated with the Konkani Language Movement in Goa. He was himself a member of the konkani Bhasha Mandal. In the early 1990s, Matanhy protested against Nylon 6,6 and, in the late 1990s, against the smelting plant, Meta-Strips. Matanhy was also associated with other movements like the Konkan Railway re-alignment issue and the anti-Special Economic Zone agitation. He was the convenor of the anti-SEZ group, called the \\"Goa's Movement Against Special Economic Zones (GMAS)\\". Saldanha was an active participant of the Goa Special Status movement and believed that Special Status to Goa was needed in order to preserve the state's unique culture and identity. ==Political career== In the late 1970s, Matanhy established the \\"Gomantak Lok Poxx\\" party. In the 2000, Matanhy was elected to the South Goa Zilla Panchayat. In 2002, he was elected as a member of the legislative assembly from Cortalim constituency as a candidate of the United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP). In 2004, he was inducted in the Cabinet of the Government of Goa headed by then Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrikar. He was given the portfolios of Tourism as well as Sports and Youth Affairs. In February 2005, then Governor of Goa S. C. Jamir dismissed the Manohar Parrikar-led government after high drama in the state legislature. The United Goans Democratic Party (which Saldanha represented in the Assembly) withdrew support to the Parrikar government. Parrikar was asked to prove his majority, by the Governor. Though the UGDP withdrew support, Saldanha, who was away in Spain on an official visit at the time of the political developments, contradicted the party's stand and conveyed his support to the Parrikar government. He sent a fax message to the Governor pledging his \\"unconditional and unqualified support\\" to the Parrikar government. After Parrikar's dismissal, Pratapsingh Rane of the Indian National Congress was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Goa. Saldanha was disqualified by then Speaker of the Goa Legislature, Francisco Sardinha, in August 2005 upon a disqualification petition filed against him by Jitendra Deshprabhu, spokesperson of the Indian National Congress. However, the Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court set aside Matanhy's disqualification in 2011. Matanhy unsuccessfully contested the elections to the 15th Lok Sabha from the South Goa (Lok Sabha constituency) as a candidate of the United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP). In January 2012, Matanhy quit the United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) due to UGDP forming an alliance with the Goa Vikas Party. He later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party and contested as a BJP candidate from the Cortalim constituency in the 2012 Goa Legislative Assembly election. After the BJP gained majority in the 2012 Goa Legislative Assembly election, Manohar Parrikar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Goa. He inducted Matanhy Saldanha in his Cabinet. Saldanha was allotted the portfolios of Tourism as well as Science and Environment. After Matanhy died in harness, his widow Alina Saldanha contested bye-elections from the Cortalim constituency as a BJP candidate and was elected unopposed to the Goa State Legislature. She was later sworn in as a Cabinet Minister in the Parrikar government. Alina Saldanha holds the portfolios of Museums, Environment and Forests. ==Death and burial== After attending the xigmo (spring festival) in Canacona the previous night, Matanhy suffered a massive heart attack in the early hours of 21 March 2012, and died at 3 am in Campal, Goa. He was buried at the cemetery of the Catholic Church of Saint Thomas, in his native village of Cansaulim, in the evening of 24 March 2012. His funeral mass was led by the Archbishop Patriarch of Goa e Dam√£o, Filipe Neri Ferr√£o and around 100 priests. The funeral was attended by around 10,000 people. In her eulogy, his wife Alina Saldanha said he wished to live after death. This was based on his faith in the Catholic Church's teachings. ==Legacy== A statue of Matanhy Saldanha was inaugurated by the then Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrikar at Cansaulim on 24 October 2014. The South Goa District Collectorate Building in Fatorda, Margao was named in honour of Matanhy as the \\"Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex\\". ==References== Category:Activists from Goa Category:1948 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Members of the Goa Legislative Assembly Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Goa Category:People from North Goa district ","title":"Jos√© Matanhy de Saldanha"},{"id":"35180552","text":"Perkins headquarters in Peterborough Perkins Engines Company Limited, a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc, is primarily a diesel engine manufacturer for several markets including agricultural, construction, material handling, power generation and industrial. It was established in Peterborough, England, in 1932. Over the years Perkins has expanded its engine ranges and produces thousands of different engine specifications including diesel and petrol engines. ==History== High-speed diesel engines A 1935 Perkins diesel car engine (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed.) F. Perkins Limited, established on 7 June 1932, was founded in Queen Street, Peterborough, to design and manufacture high-speed diesel enginesF. PERKINS LIMITED (Incorporated under the Companies Act, 1929). The Times, 23 July 1951; pg. 9; Issue 52060 by Frank Perkins and Charles Wallace Chapman. Chapman was design engineer (technical director) and company secretary and had a ten percent shareholding. He was to remain with the business for more than a decade before re-joining the Royal Navy ReserveObituary, Mr C. W. Chapman. The Times, 3 December 1979; pg. 14; Issue 60490 though remaining a consultant to the company. Frank Perkins obtained further initial support from directors Alan J M Richardson and George Dodds Perks.Z Yaakov Wise, Manchester Papers in Economic and Social History, Number 63, Manchester University, March 2008 Before Chapman and Perkins the diesel engine was a heavy and slow revving workhorse, lacking performance. Chapman's concept was the high-speed diesel ‚Äì an engine that could challenge gasoline as the primary motive power. The company‚Äôs first high-speed diesel engine was Perkins' four-cylinder Vixen, which made its debut in 1932: in October 1935 Perkins became the first company to hold six world diesel speed records for a variety of distances set at the Brooklands race track in Surrey. Sales were strong and by the time of World War II the company made two series of engines, P4 and P6. Soon after the war, the company went public, and established a number of licensees for local manufacturing and sale. Massey-Ferguson F. Perkins Ltd was purchased by its largest customer, Massey Ferguson, in 1959. Keeping its separate identity, the business continued under the name of Perkins Engines and in 1994 became a subsidiary of LucasVarity. Development continued and Perkins updated its engines to meet stricter emissions rules while developing new series for power generation and forklift trucks. Brands such as Dodge, Ford, Grosspal and Ranquel for all their diesel lines, fitted Perkins engines for more than two decades. Others like GEMA, Araus, Bernardin and Rotania used their impellers for harvesters at length. Argentina and Perkins Argentina/Pertrak Pertrak was created in 1961, as a licensee of Perkins Engines of England, and was dedicated to the manufacture of engines for pick ups, trucks and tractors. The most productive period was in the 1970s when 200,000 engines were produced. In 2010, the last engine was made in Ferreyra, C√≥rdoba, when the license was dropped. Throughout this period of almost 40 years, more than 500,000 engines were produced. The factory continues to make engine parts for other makes such as Fiat and Scania. Caterpillar A supplier to Caterpillar Inc since the 1970s, Perkins was bought by Caterpillar in 1998 for , creating what they claimed was the world's largest diesel engine manufacturer. Perkins now has manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, China, India and a joint venture with Ishikawajima-Shibaura-Machinery company in Japan. On 1 January 2009 Gwenne Henricks became President of Perkins Engines replacing Hans Haefeli, after having worked in Caterpillar‚Äôs Electronics and Connected Worksite Division in North America. Henricks is also a vice-president of Caterpillar. Discontinued products Various Perkins diesel engines have been made for industrial, agricultural, construction, material handling, marine and power generation markets, and Perkins gas-based engines (natural gas, landfill gas, digester gas, bio gas and mine gas) are used for continuous power generation. Perkins' 4.99 1.6 litre (99 cubic inch) and the P4C engine [192 cubic inch], producing 45 or , were popular in Europe and Israel for taxis and commercially driven cars during the 1950s and early 1960s; many cars, including American imports, were retrofitted with these engines for taxi use, with kits made by Hunter NV of Belgium. Perkins engines were also used as standard factory equipment in Jeeps and Dodge trucks in the United States in the 1960s. They also continued to be popular in European trucks from their original customer, Commer and other companies. The Perkins 6.354 medium duty engine was designed to be compact enough to replace petrol/gasoline V8 engines in trucks, despite its in-line six-cylinder design. Producing in early years (later rising to 120 hp), it had a small jackshaft driven by the timing gears for the auxiliary drive, with the oil pump driven by a quill shaft so it could run auxiliary equipment at engine speed with simple couplings. Until 2004 Perkins manufactured engines for JCB, but since then JCB manufactures their own engines. Acquisitions After acquiring Rolls-Royce Diesels of Shrewsbury in 1984, Perkins continued to supply British Rail with engines for its diesel multiple units. Perkins went on to purchase L Gardner & Sons in the summer of 1986 to complement their line of lighter diesel engines.Perkins R/R Commercial Motor 24 March 1984 == Perkins Powered Equipment == Perkins engines are found in a wide range of machinery, including tractors, generators and industrial tools and machinery. While Perkins have customers in many sectors, the main consumer of their engines Caterpillar Inc, who are also the parent company.

It places emphasis on how the player's leaderships skills fare against an onslaught of problems, such as diminishing survival resources, group trust and morale, zombie extermination, base defenses, and people's lives. The game combines elements of shooters, stealth, role-playing and strategy games and the game challenges players to survive by exploring, scavenging, and fighting the undead. It was released for the Xbox 360 on June 5, 2013 and was met with positive reviews. A Microsoft Windows version was released on September 20, 2013 via Steam's Early Access, with a release following on November 5, 2013. A remastered version called the Year-One Survival Edition was released on April 28, 2015 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One with mixed reviews. State of Decay 2 was announced at Xbox's E3 2016. The game introduced cooperative multiplayer. It was released on May 22, 2018. State of Decay 3 was announced at Xbox's 2020 Games Showcase. ==Gameplay== State of Decay emphasizes utilizing existing resources, which are finite. Here the player character stands atop a tower and scouts for possible survival camps and places that may contain supplies. State of Decay contains elements of third person combat and simulation (building base and outposts). The player is in charge of a small group of survivors and can either follow the storyline or perform tasks that ensure their community's survival. The game world is 16 square kilometers, 8 square kilometers of which is playable. The player can choose from several locations to build a base, then reinforce and improve it with various facilities like watch towers, gardens, sleeping quarters, kitchens, workshops, medical bays, etc. to help keep survivors safe and healthy. Part of the game is balancing the use of resources: food, medicine, ammo and construction materials. They can be obtained by scavenging or trading with NPCs. Only food can be grown at the base. The player can interact with survivors outside of their group: trading with them, helping them or recruiting them. The game features two relationship meters, the first determines if a survivor can be recruited, and the second dictates if they can be controlled. Only one survivor can be controlled at a time, though the player can ask an AI- controlled survivor to accompany them, and in certain missions, one or more AI-controlled survivors will accompany the player. The Storyline mode features around 150 characters, with varying facial features and clothing. Each character has a fixed set of \\"traits\\" which give them advantages or flaws (such as tire out more easily, or can improve a certain skill faster). Except for the story-related characters, most characters can be assigned to survivor groups and be recruited. Each character also has an \\"attitude\\" parameter, affected by game events (a near death experience, death of another character, or having accomplished a difficult task). These attitudes can affect their behaviors, sometimes requiring player intervention. Zombies are the main threat in State of Decay. They respawn infinitely (unless the player establishes an outpost, which prevents spawns), are attracted to noise, and are capable of sprinting nearly as fast as the characters. The player can choose to confront them directly, use stealth to sneak past them, or divert them using items like firecrackers. In addition, there are special types of zombies, such as the animal-like \\"Ferals\\" or the tank-like \\"Juggernauts\\" that are quite dangerous in one-on-one confrontations. The game doesn't have human enemies, only zombies. The game features over 100 different weapons, including around 30 melee weapons that can be found while scavenging (they cannot be crafted). Melee weapon and firearms are further divided into sub-categories, which have different attack animations and effects. All weapons have a durability rating, and will break when used excessively without repairs. Besides weapons, the player can find or create various consumables to improve their chances of survival, such as painkillers and pipe bombs. Besides walking, the player has access to several types of cars, each with its own characteristics like maneuverability and speed. All vehicles can be damaged and destroyed when running over zombies or hitting obstacles, although they can be repaired at the home base if they have the necessary facilities. ==Plot== The story takes place in the fictional Trumbull Valley. The first playable character is Marcus Campbell, a store clerk. After returning from a fishing trip with his friend and a Trumbull local, Ed Jones, he finds that the world has degenerated into a zombie apocalypse. The two are soon joined by Maya Torres, a soldier. They acquire a walkie-talkie and make contact with Lily Ritter. Following her direction, they make their way to a church called the Church of the Ascension, where Lily and several other survivors have made a home base. With Ed wounded, the trio accept Lily's offer to let them stay. As the game progresses, the survivors become aware of the United States Army's presence in Trumbull Valley, led by Sergeant Erik Tan and Captain Diane Montressor. They soon learn that the army's top priority is not to evacuate the survivors, but to contain and try to find the cause of the outbreak. The players also find the local civic leader, Judge Lawton, has barricaded the courthouse with the local law enforcement. She places citizens in her care under martial laws, planning to rebuild after the zombie incursion blows over. Finally, the players are also introduced to The Wilkersons, a group of hillbilly gun-runners who are using the apocalypse to profit and exploit other survivors. Near the end, the courthouse falls to a zombie attack and Judge Lawton dies. Captain Montressor is evacuated, leaving behind Sergeant Tan and his men. The player, along with Tan, discovers numerous dead bodies dumped at the reservoir, explaining the cause of the, \\"Black Fever,\\" that has plagued numerous survivors in Trumbull Valley. With their only water source contaminated and long term survival no longer an option, they plan to leave the valley. After raiding a zombie-infested warehouse to get explosives, the group head to the only road leading out of the valley, now blocked with a massive concrete wall. While Tan sets up the explosives, the player holds off incoming zombies. Tan realizes the detonator has malfunctioned, and the explosives cannot be detonated from a safe distance. He volunteers to manually detonate it, claiming he's already infected. He sacrifices himself and sets off the explosives, which destroys the wall. As the smoke clears, the player sees the other side is also filled with destroyed cars and bodies, implying the apocalypse has already spread outside Trumbull Valley. The survivors leave the valley and the game ends. ==Downloadable content== Breakdown On July 20, 2013, in conjunction with the PC development for State of Decay, Undead Labs announced an upcoming downloadable content (DLC) titled \\"Breakdown\\" for both PC and console users. The DLC adds a \\"Sandbox Mode\\", where the player leads a group of survivors in repairing an RV in order to escape the valley. The DLC allows infinite gameplay and no story line, simply allowing players to put their survival skills to the test. Breakdown adds 6 levels/tiers for players to survive in, and as players progress from one level to the next, the difficulty increases, resulting in numerous faster and stronger zombies, along with higher numbers of special zombies, forcing players to sneak their way around the map and use distractions in order to survive the higher levels. To continue on to the next level, the player needs to find the RV, which spawns in random locations throughout the map with each level. The players are only allowed to take a total of six characters (Lily included) with them to the next level. On November 15, 2013, Undead Labs officially announced the Breakdown release date for November 29, 2013. Lifeline Not long after the release of Breakdown, Undead Labs announced that a second DLC was in development. On February 4, 2014, an addition on the Steam Database confirmed the DLC to be named \\"Lifeline.\\" On February 11, 2014, Undead Labs officially announced news of the \\"Lifeline\\" DLC, also confirming it to include the fictional city of Danforth that can be seen just outside Fairfield. On February 27, it was explained that the DLC will explore the military's side during the first days of the outbreak. The player will play the role of a military unit by the name of Greyhound One in Danforth City. The player will be tasked with keeping a group of survivors alive long enough to get them to safety, as well as defending the main base by setting traps and planning tactics. But unlike the typical survival only bases that deal with just excesses of hordes, there is a new threat called sieges that get progressively harder with each one that passes. The DLC is set on more of a time-based approach instead of the never-ending approach seen in the Breakdown DLC. At the Pax East 2014 convention, Undead Labs expected it to be released on June 6, 2014. The release date was revealed to be Friday, May 30, earlier than was previously expected. The DLC features a new map and narrative. The DLC has been priced the same as the first DLC, Breakdown, which is $6.99 / ¬£5.59. ==Development== State of Decay was first announced in 2011 as an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive title originally titled Class 3. Jeff Strain, the founder of ArenaNet and co-creator of World of Warcraft, wanted a game where individual players could make up their own zombie survival plans and put them to the test. Then, he set out to create the game, which runs on CryEngine 3.Mallory, Jordan. \\"Class3 Runs on CryEngine 3, Has Some Lazy Zombies.\\" Joystiq. 21 Aug. 2011. Accessed: 23 Mar. 2012. On May 16, 2013, Undead Labs announced that State of Decay had gone into the final certification process and is now ready for testing by the game's publisher, Microsoft Studios. State of Decay was envisioned as a step towards Undead Labs' full online console game, Class4. Class4 will be one of the first zombie massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) to come to the Xbox One. In a 2014 interview, Undead Labs founder Jeff Strain stated that State of Decay had officially become a franchise, with the company's partnership with Microsoft Studios confirmed. He stated that the first State of Decay was \\"just the start of (Undead Labs') long-term ambitions\\". ==Reception== State of Decay has received positive reviews from critics. Sanya of Undead Labs stated that \\"2013 Was a Damned Good Year\\" in terms of the positive reviews the game received. Metacritic scores range from 60/100 to 100/100, with an average score of 78/100. The game sold more than 250,000 copies in its first 48 hours of release to the Xbox Live Arcade. As of June 17, 2013, the game has sold more than 550,000 copies. Within the end of June the game had sold more than 700,000 copies, making it the second-fastest- selling XBLA game of all time. On October 4, 2013 Undead Labs announced that the game had sold one million copies. The figure combined both XBLA and Steam Early Access sales. On November 30, Undead Labs had sold more than one million copies of State of Decay. Polygon gave a positive review, praising the survival and role-playing aspects of the game. Reviewer Arthur Gies wrote, \\"State of Decay is one of the most cohesive, terrifying and engaging open- world games I've ever played.\\" The Australian Classification Board refused classification because \\"[the game] contains the option of self-administered drugs throughout, in order to restore players' health or boost their stamina\\". Jeff Strain said \\"we are going to come up with options, including changing names of certain medications in the game to comply with ratings requirements. Whatever our path forward, it's going to take a bit.\\" On July 11, 2013 State of Decay was rated R18+ for high impact violence. ==Sequel== A sequel, State of Decay 2, was announced live at Xbox's 2016 E3 live conference. The game was released on May 22, 2018. ==References *Official website *State of Decay at MobyGames Category:2013 video games Category:Action- adventure games Category:CryEngine games Category:Early access video games Category:Horror video games Category:LGBT-related video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Microsoft franchises Category:Open world video games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Survival video games Category:Video games scored by Jesper Kyd Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Video games set in Ohio Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox One games Category:Zombie video games ","title":"State of Decay (video game)"},{"id":"35180572","text":"Maidstone Corporation Tramways operated a tramway service in Maidstone in England between 1904 and 1930.The Golden Age of Tramways.

It is also known as Phosvel, Abar and Vcs 506. Leptophos was primarily used as a pesticide and fungicide. for rice, cotton, fruit and vegetables until its use was discontinued in 1975 in USA, but still sold in South-Eastern Asia in 1981. Leptophos was first discovered to be toxic in 1974 when more than 1000 water buffaloes died after exposure to leptophos in Egypt. In response to this event, the effect of leptophos was investigated on chickens, mice and sheep. ==History== In Egypt, leptophos used on cotton in 1971 caused the death of more than 1000 water buffalos and a number of farmers. The compound was never registered for domestic use by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) but was exported from the U.S. to at least 30 countries. Leptophos was discontinued for use in late 1975 due to its high toxicity. Between 1971 and 1976 the U.S. used $4 million in United States Agency for International Development funds to ship 13.9 million pounds of leptophos and other banned pesticides to 50 countries. In 1975 U.S. companies alone, exported over 3 million pounds of leptophos. In 1976, workers in the Velsicol's chemical plant in Bayport, Texas, reported serious neurological symptoms, the Phosvel zombies, and filed a lawsuit against the company. When Colombia banned leptophos in 1977, the American company Velsicol stopped the production and shipped its Colombian stocks to El Salvador. No prohibitions exist in El Salvador. In other instances Leptophos was imported to Costa Rica via Mexico and Panama, and until 1981 Leptophos was being sold in Indonesia. ==Structure and reactivity== It is stable at normal temperatures; at 180 degrees Celsius 85 percent of the material is decomposed in 5 hours, and at 208 degrees Celsius it decomposes in 2 hours. The main product of thermal decomposition is the S-methyl isomer O-(4-bromo-2,5-chlorophenyl) S-methyl phenylphosphonothioate. Leptophos is hydrolysed slowly under alkaline conditions. The material is stable toward acid. In the laboratory, when irradiated with high intensity UV light in the presence of a strong UV sensitizer, leptophos is rapidly converted first to O-(2,5-dichlorophenyl) O-methylphenyl-phosphonothioate, referred to as the dichloro-photoproduct, and then to a material with the empirical formula C13H10ClO2PS (tentatively identified as 3-chloro-6-methoxydibenz [1,2]-oxaphosphorin-6-thione or O-methyl-O,P-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2,6-ylene) phosphonothioate and referred to as the monochloro-photoproduct. UV light increases the rate of hydrolysis under field conditions. ==Synthesis== There are multiple ways to synthesize leptophos. One of the methods that is possible for doing that is to let O-methyl phenylthiophosponyl chloride react with 4-bromo-2,5-dichlorophenol: C7H8ClOPS + C6H3BrCl2O ‚Üí C13H10BrCl2O2PS + HCl. It is also possible to produce it by the reaction of phenylphosphonothioic dichloride with methanol and trimethylamine in toluene follow by a reaction with potassium 4-bromo-2,5-dichlorophenoxide. ==Toxicodynamics== Leptophos is an irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterases in vitro. The inhibitory activity of leptophos seems to be related to hydrophobic interactions involving lipophilic groups as phenyl and 4-bromo-2,5-dichlorophenyl and the ability of these groups to donate electrons to firm a complex with the enzyme. An example of a cholinesterase is the acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This cholinesterase converts the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the inactive metabolites choline and acetate. Acetylcholine receptors are of two types: # A fast-acting ion-channel controlled receptor. # A slow-acting receptor that acts through a G-protein (guanine nucleotide-binding protein) that stimulates second- messengers (often cyclic AMP) to indirectly open ion-channels. Direct ion- channel controlling receptors can respond in microseconds, whereas indirect second-messenger controlling receptors take milliseconds to produce a response. When leptophos binds to the AChE, the acetylcholine does not get inactivated. This interferes with a normal signal transfer. This means that a nerve signal can't get transmitted in the way it should be and leads to a broad range of clinical symptoms. ==Metabolism== The main metabolic pathway in of leptophos in rats is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the compound. The main Metabolites are phosphonic acid, 4-bromo-2,3-dichlorophenol, O-methyl O-hydrogen phenylphosphonothioate and methyl hydrogen phenylphosphonate. It is unsure which of the two possible pathways is used to get phosphonic acid. 500px ==Absorption and excretion== Following oral administration, leptophos is excreted in urine and faeces as several components. Several components found in urine included: O-methyl phenyl phosphonate (a major component in raturine), O-methyl phenyl phosphonothioic acid (a major component in miceurine), leptophos phenol, and phenyl phosphonic acid. Interspecies differences in metabolism can explain the difference in major metabolites is mice and rats. Studies in plants indicated that leptophos was slowly absorbed following a foliar treatment with the major quantity found to remain on the leaf surface. Studies with several leaf types (bean - lettuce) showed that residues diminished rapidly on both types of surfaces. The primary mechanism by which leptophos was lost was presumed to be by volatilization. Qualitatively, leptophos was metabolized to products similar to those found with the mouse. Phenyl phosphonate derivatives were also recovered from plant surfaces. ==Indications== Leptophos, as well as every other organophosphate, causes acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Because of this inhibition the following symptoms were observed. {  -  Skin  Skin rash, itching, burning or prickling of the skin, tingling or numbness of hands and the face, muscular twitching or cramps in the face, neck and limbs. A positive score on three or more symptoms was used as a cut off point for further analysis. -  Respiratory  Chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulties with breathing, wheezing, runny nose, irritation of the throat and cough. If the patient showed three or more of these symptoms they were considered having respiratory symptoms. -  Systemic  Excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive salivation, abdominal pain, burning on urination and poor appetite. A positive score on three or more symptoms was used as a cut off point for further analysis. -  Eye  Lacrimation and irritation of the eyes. If both symptoms were observed the patient was considered to have eye problems due to the poisoning. -  CNS  Trembling hands difficulty in seeing, irritability, forgetfulness, restlessness and difficulties falling asleep. A positive score on five or more of the 14 symptoms was used as a cut off point for further analysis. } ==Toxicity== Due to the severe toxicity of leptophos, the lethal doses (LD) are determined in animal tests. Toxicity differs between species and between exposure through the skin, inhalation and the gastrointestinal track (table). {  - ! Organism !! Test Type !! Route !! Reported Dose !! Effect !!

There are three groups of Mekens speakers: *Sak√Ørabi√°t (Sakirabi√°, Sakir√°p) *Koaratira (Guaratira, a.k.a. Kano√© ‚Äì not the same as the Kano√© language) *Koarategayat (Guarat√©gaya, Guarategaja, Warateg√°ya) Location of the Mekens/Sakurabiat speakers in Rond√¥nia ==Background== The Mek√©ns language is a highly endangered Brazilian indigenous language belonging to the Tupi language trunk, and classified as one of the five surviving languages of the Tupari sub-family (Galucio: 2001, 2). The language is spoken by approximately 25 people (ibid) in the state of Rond√¥nia, in the Amazon region of northwestern Brazil, straddling the border with neighbouring Bolivia. Nowadays, the majority of Mek√©ns language speakers live inside the federal indigenous reservation Rio Mequens, located within the municipality of Cerejeira, in the vicinity of the Mequens river tributary. The inhabitants of the reserve refer to both their language and ethnic group as the Sakurabiat (or Sakirabiat), literally translating as ‚ÄúSpider-Monkey‚Äù (Galucio: 2001, 3). The language is spoken by the members of this ethnic group, with a total population of 66 (as of 2003), living within the reserve (PIB Sociambiental). Within the reserve there are four distinct, documented subgroups, namely the Sakirabiat, Guarategayet, Guaratira, and Siwkweriat groups. Although initially a term for only one dialect group, the term Sakirabiat has now become the one name which encompasses all of the subgroups. This can be attributed to a sharp decline in their population during the 20th century (Galucio: 2001, 3). In the Rio Mequens reservation today, Portuguese is spoken by everyone living within the boundaries, and has become the first language of most of the residents. Furthermore, the majority of the population is monolingual and unable to speak Mek√©ns fluently. Only about 23 people on the reserve are fluent, with most of these people being elders; however most of the residents are familiar with the everyday words of the language, including the names of the most common animals and plants, kinship terms, manufactured objects, and domestic utensils (PIB Socioambiental). Children on the reserve are not learning Mek√©ns, meaning the language is not being effectively transmitted from one generation to the next. This is a clear indication of a high level of language endangerment. According to historical sources, the Guapor√© river basin has consistently been the documented location of the members of the linguistic family known as the Tupi-Tupani family. (Galucio: 2001, 8) The first documented contact of Europeans with the indigenous peoples living on the right bank of the Guapor√© river dates back to the 17th century. (Galucio: 2001, 10). For the century that followed, the area of present-day Rond√¥nia was heavily occupied by both Portuguese and Spanish settlers, who were disputing the boundaries of their neighbouring colonies. In the late 18th century this area was abruptly abandoned by the settlers, as the colonies were moving toward independence and the interest in enforcing colonial boundaries sharply decreased. The area was largely empty until the mid-19th century when demand for rubber drove rubber tappers to the region and brought back a heavy occupation of the area. Although having suffered substantial losses in their population, the Sakurabiat peoples survived these periods of occupation, an outcome attributed to the isolation of the villages that stood on the right bank of the Guapor√© river. Their location in the headwaters of the Guapor√© River‚Äôs west tributaries made them difficult to access, and likely saved the group from extinction. (Galucio: 2001, 10) According to the accounts of members of the Guaratira people, the first interactions of the Sakurabiat peoples with outsiders occurred in the early 1930s, when European-Bolivian settlers navigated the Mequens river upstream, reaching their villages. The outbreak of the Second World War greatly increased the demand for rubber and led to conflicts between the rubber tappers and the indigenous population. Their traditional lands were invaded and they were forced to yield to the rubber-tapping industry. Furthermore, epidemic diseases including measles and influenza, brought by these outsiders spread rampant, causing numerous deaths and a drop in a population numbering in the thousands (during the early 1930s and 1940s) to 64 people in 1994. (Galucio: 2001, 11) The Mek√©ns language is a language classified under three sub-families of the large Tupian trunk. (See attached diagram) Moving downward from the Tupi trunk classification comes the Tuparic, Nuclear Tuparic, and Akuntsu-Mekens sub-families, the latter to which the Mek√©ns language belongs. (Glottoblog) The amount of literature available on the language is very limited, and there are no pedagogical grammars written on it either. The descriptive grammar available involves the dissertation and three subsequent research papers by Ana Vilacy Galucio, a researcher who received a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Chicago in 2001, with her dissertation on the Mek√©ns language. She is currently a senior researcher and the Coordinator of the Human Sciences Department at the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi research institution in Bel√©m, Brazil, and an invited researcher of the Traces of Contact Project at Raboud University in Nijmegen, Holland. (Raboud University, Who are We?) Her dissertation paper, titled the Morphosyntax of Mekens (Tupi), involves research and data collected through field work done at the Rio Mequens Indigenous Reservation. It includes a detailed chapter on the morphology of the language, including lexical categories, inflectional morphology, and word formation processes. There is also a detailed description of the Mek√©ns syntax in the subsequent chapter which includes phrasal categories, as well as noun, verb, adpositional, and adverb phrases. The final chapter of her dissertation focuses on the structure of sentences, including the declarative, imperative, and interrogative sentence structures, non-verbal predicate clauses, complex sentences, and pragmatically marked sentence structures. In 2002, Galucio wrote a subsequent paper describing the word order and constituent structure in Mek√©ns and, in 2006, a paper in Portuguese on the relativization of the Sakurabiat (Mek√©ns) language. Also in 2006, she published a book titled Narrativas Tradicionais Sakurabiat (Traditional Sakurabiat Narratives) (Museu Goeldi), an illustrated bilingual story book containing 25 traditional Sakurabiat legends or tales, as well as illustrations made by children living in the reserve. Most recently, in 2011, Galucio published her paper Nominalization in the Mekens Language. In this research paper, Galucio investigates ‚Äúthe different morphosyntactic and semantic properties of the distinct forms of deverbal nominalizations in Mek√©ns‚Äù, in which she tries to ‚Äúuncover the typological properties of this language‚Äù (Nominalization in the Mekens Language, Galucio, 1). The Sakurabiat language has not yet been described in a language documentation project. However, according to an article published in Portuguese in 2013 on the Museu Goeldi website, there is currently a documentation project in the works. This article, named Dicion√°rio Sakurabiat (Sakurabiat Dictionary) states that Ana Galucio, along with her coworker Camille Cardoso Miranda, are currently working on a Mek√©ns-Portuguese dictionary, as a way to register and document collected data from the speakers of the language. (Museu Goeldi) This is a project which aims to improve the instruction, learning, and preservation of the culture of the Sakurabiat people. Furthermore, there is a subproject currently being undertaken by Alana Neves, student at the Federal University of Par√°, and oriented by Galucio, which aims to organize the current Mek√©ns texts available into an electronic database. These projects are being done with an eye to creating a complete grammar book in the Sakurabiat language. This would establish a pedagogical grammar resource which could be used to revitalize the Mek√©ns language and thus protect it from extinction. (ibid) ==Grammar== This grammar aims to give an overview of the Mek√©ns (Sakurabiat) language, based on the PhD dissertation of Ana Vilacy Galucio, published at the University of Chicago in 2001. The Mek√©ns language is a highly endangered Tupi language, spoken by 25 people (Galucio: 2001, 2), among members of the ethnic group of the same name. It is found within the boundaries of the Rio Mek√©ns Indigenous Reservation, located in the state of Rond√¥nia in northwestern Brazil, along the border with Bolivia. The language belongs to the sub-category Tupari, where it is classified alongside four other languages: Tupari, Makurap, Ayuru and Akuntsu (5). Among the Tupari languages, vocalic phonemes have remained very constant over time. The phonemic vowel inventory in these languages is nearly identical; the phonemic inventory of consonants is very similar among them, but with slight differences. Although the four languages are not mutually intelligible, their sound correspondences are very regular, providing clear proof of their genetic relationship (7). The collection of sounds which occur in Mek√©ns is similar to that of the other Tupian languages, including consonants from the following series: voiced and voiceless stops, fricatives, liquids, nasals and glides (21). There are 15 consonants in total, with 5 voiced stops, 2 voiceless stops, 1 fricative, 1 liquid, 4 nasals, and 2 glides. Table 1: The Phonemic Inventory of Consonants: {   labial coronal palatal velar labiovelar glottal - voiced stops p t  k k ∑ (?) - voiceless stops b ‚Äî  g ‚Äî  - fricatives  s     - liquids  …æ     - nasals m n  ≈ã ≈ã ∑  - glides   y    } As for the vocalic system in Mek√©ns, it contains 5 vowels in total, with noted contrasts between nasal and oral vowels, as well as between short and long vowels. The following table displays these contrasts in the vowels. Table 2: The Phonemic Inventory of Vowels: {  Short oral V Long oral V Short nasal V Long nasal V - i …® i: …®: ƒ© …®ÃÉ ƒ©: …®ÃÉ: - e o e: o: ·∫Ω √µ ·∫Ω: √µ: -  a  a:  √£  √£: } In the Mek√©ns language, verbs have a moderately high number of morphemes, to the point where an entire sentence may be constructed using a single verb. Nouns however do not demonstrate a complex morphological structure. With nouns there is no case marking, no agreement between them and their modifiers, and no formal marking in either the possessor or the possessee in possessive constructions which involve two nominals (27). The morphological process of stem alternation is achieved through affixation, in which suffixation is preferred to prefixation. The personal inflectional markers and the derivational valence changing morphemes, including causative, comitative and intransitivizer, are the only prefixes in the language. All of the other affixes employed in Mek√©ns are suffixes which mark number, tense-aspect-mood and category change (nominalization and verbalization) (28). There are two types of pronouns in Mek√©ns - these include personal and reflexive. Nouns and pronouns are clearly distinguished from each other, in that only nouns can occur with a personal prefix or form a phrasal unit with a preceding nominal. Pronouns may not be modified by a demonstrative, but nouns may. Table 3: Personal Pronouns {  Person Pronouns - 1s (1st person singular) √µt - 2s (2nd person singular) ·∫Ωt - 3s (3rd person singular) te - 3c (3rd person co-referential) sete - 1pIn (1st personal plural, inclusive) kise - 1pEx (1st personal plural, exclusive) ose - 2p (2nd person plural) eyat - 3p (3rd person plural) teyat - 3pc (3rd person plural, co-referential) seteyat } In Mek√©ns, the two first person plural pronouns (the inclusive and exclusive pronouns, respectively) are formed by adding the prefixes for the first person plural inclusive ‚Äúki-‚Äú and the first person singular ‚Äúo-‚Äú with the morpheme ‚Äú-se‚Äù. The third person and third person co-referential plural personal pronouns are formed by adding the third person singular and third person co-referential pronouns to the collective clitic ‚Äú-iat‚Äù. In example 1A, the personal pronoun ‚Äú√µt‚Äù is found at the end of the sentence. In Example 1B, the personal third person co-referential pronoun ‚Äúsete‚Äù is found in the 2nd position of the sentence. (38). Example 1A: o-iko na e-ko pa √µt 1s-food Verbzlr 2s-ingest fut I ' You will be my food, I will eat you' Example 1B: poret sete p…®…®p te se-eit te kwa√µt now he/she/it burst foc 3c-belly foc foxo 'Then it burst, the fox's belly' Table 4: Reflexive Pronouns' {  Person Pronouns - 1s (1st person singular) √µr·∫Ωp - 2s (2nd person singular) ·∫Ωr·∫Ωp - 3s (3rd person singular) te·∫Ωp - 3c (3rd person co-referential) sete·∫Ωp - 1pIn (1st personal plural, inclusive) kise·∫Ωp - 1pEx (1st personal plural, exclusive) ose·∫Ωp - 2pl (2nd person plural) eyar·∫Ωp - 3pl (3rd person plural) teyar·∫Ωp - 3plc (3rd person plural, co-referential) seteyar·∫Ωp } Reflexive pronouns in Mek√©ns are formed by taking the personal pronouns and adding them to the enclitic formative ‚Äú-·∫Ωp‚Äù, which translates literally as ‚Äúreally‚Äù or ‚Äúindeed‚Äù (39). Reflexive pronouns are employed as emphatic forms, and occur in a sentence together with the verb arguments they refer to (40). The subject and object are the same when the reflexive pronoun is used. One may also omit either the reflexive pronoun or the personal pronoun in speech. In example 2A, the reflexive first person singular pronoun ‚Äú√µr·∫Ωp‚Äù is seen at the beginning of the sentence, with the 1st person singular morpheme ‚Äúo‚Äù attached to the verb, and the 1st personal singular pronoun ‚Äú√µt‚Äù at the end. In example 2B, the personal pronoun is absent, with the 3rd person co-referential pronoun ‚Äúse‚Äù beginning the sentence, and the reflexive 3rd person singular pronoun ‚Äúsete·∫Ωp‚Äù at the end. In example 2C, the reflexive 2nd person pronoun is absent, with the 2nd person singular morpheme ‚Äúe‚Äù attached to the verb ‚Äúmi‚Äù and the 2nd person personal pronoun ‚Äú·∫Ωt‚Äù at the end. Example 2A: √µr o-mi-a √µt I 1s-shoot/kil-Them I 'I shot myself' Example 2B: se-sereka-t sete 3c-cut. Them-Past he/she 'He cut himself' Example 2C: e-mi-a ·∫Ωt 2s-shoot/kill-Them you 'You shot yourself' Inflectional morphology is an integral component of the Mek√©ns language. The system of personal inflection involves the three word classes of nouns, adjectives, and verbs, with functions ranging from genitive and verb agreement markers to the clear distinction between the coreferential and non- coreferential third person (73). Verbs require a prefix to denote person. Adjectives never occur as stems on their own, rather they are always preceded by either a noun, demonstrative or person prefix (76). A prefix modified by an adjective stem forms a noun phrase, preceded by the prefix. In example 3, the adjective ‚Äúakop‚Äù (meaning hot) is preceded by the 1st person singular morpheme ‚Äúo‚Äù, with the personal pronoun ‚Äú√µt‚Äù at the end. Example 3: o-akop √µt 1s-hot I 'I am hot‚Äô In Mek√©ns, the majority of derived words are formed by affixation, which is the most used form of word formation in the language. As is the case in most Tupian languages, derivative morphemes including causative and verbalizers are used to create specific word categories and new lexical items. Although the processes of reduplication and compounding are present in the language, neither of them occupy a central role in it (115). There are seven derivational affixes employed in Mek√©ns. Two of these are the valence changing prefixes ‚Äúmo-‚Äú (simple causative) and the ‚Äúsese-‚Äú (comitative causative), which occurs in intransitive verbs. The other affixes include the five word class changing morphemes: the ‚Äú-ka‚Äù, and ‚Äú-kwa‚Äù (transitivizer), ‚Äú-ap‚Äù and ‚Äú-pit‚Äù (deverbals) and ‚Äúe-‚Äú (intransitivizers). The simple causative prefix is attached to intransitive verbs. The two allomorphs of the morpheme are defined according to the phonological forms of the verb stem to which they attach (96). ‚ÄúMo-‚Äú attaches to the vowel initial stems, and ‚Äú√µ-‚Äú to the consonant initial stems. Most transitive and intransitive verbs can be nominalized by use of the deverbal suffix ‚Äú-ap‚Äù. In example 4, the nominalizer ‚Äú-ap‚Äù is attached to the verb ‚Äúmi‚Äù (kill) to create a noun (meaning an ‚Äúarrow or gun‚Äù). Example 4: mi-ap kill- Nmlzr 'arrow or gun' (lit. 'an instrument that kills') The adjectivizer in Mek√©ns is employed by use of the suffix ‚Äú-pit‚Äù. It can attach to any of the three types of lexical verbs (transitive, intransitive or uninflectible) and creates an adjective stem. In example 5, the adjectivizer works by attaching its stem ‚Äú-pit‚Äù to the verb ‚Äúoetobeka‚Äù (meaning ‚Äúlose‚Äù) to create the adjective ‚Äúlost‚Äù. Example 5: o-ike otat poka-ap oetobeka-pit ar-a-t 1s-brother fire burn-Nmlzr lose-Adjzr get-them-past 'My brother found the lost lighter' Reduplication and compounding are the two other processes of stem formation/alteration found in Mek√©ns, the process of reduplication being productive with verbs, however also registered in noun formation. Reduplication takes place through the reduplication of the entire verb stem. Any verb stem may be reduplicated to indicate iterative meaning, the way in which an event is performed, or simple repetition. An example of reduplication is that of the adjective stem in the noun ‚Äúpaak-paak‚Äù (meaning ‚Äúheron‚Äù), with the word ‚Äúpaak‚Äù meaning ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. In compounding, two or more existing words are combined to form a new word. This occurs when verb and noun stems are formed, and includes cases of noun incorporation (28). Complex or composite words are formed through the addition of up to three lexical stems (105). In Example 6, the two words ‚Äúkimak√£y‚Äù ‚Äúsoil‚Äù and ‚Äúy·∫Ω·∫Ωt‚Äù ‚Äúashes‚Äù are combined to produce one word ‚Äúdust‚Äù. Example 6: kimak√£y-y·∫Ω·∫Ωt soil ashes 'dust' ==Valency Change== Valency change is seen in Mek√©ns, through affixation in word formation processes. These processes include causatives (simple and comitative), transitivizers, and intransitivizers. Valency increase is achieved through simple and comitative causative formations and through the use of transitivers; while valency decrease is achieved through the use of intransitivizers. The simple causative increases valency and is formed by the addition of a prefix. There are two allomorphs of this morpheme - namely ‚Äúmo-‚Äú and ‚Äú√µ-‚Äú. ‚ÄúMo-‚Äú is attached to verb stems beginning with a vowel, and ‚Äú√µ-‚Äú is attached to verb stems beginning with a consonant. If the verb stem begins with an unstressed vowel, then the vowel of the prefix fuses with this initial vowel. In causative constructions, the causative morpheme is used to indicate that a participant (the causer) in the sentence is acting upon another participant (the causee), causing the latter to perform the action stated by the predicate. In this sense, another argument is added to the verb, effectively turning intransitive verbs into transitive verbs. Through the addition of the causative morpheme, a causer is introduced into a sentence, and becomes the new argument (Galucio: 2001, 96). Example 1A shows an intransitive verb construction, with a single verb and argument. In Example 1B, the valency of this sentence is increased through a causative construction. The morpheme ‚Äú-mo‚Äù is prefixed onto the verb, with the subject ‚Äúhe‚Äù of the verb in part A becoming the causee ‚Äúthe child‚Äù in the new causative construction in part B. Example 1A: se-er-a-t 3c-sleep-THEM-past ‚ÄòHe slept‚Äô Example 1B: k…®r…®t mo-er-a-t child CAU-sleep-THEM-past ‚ÄòHe made the child sleep‚Äô Transitive verb constructions may also become causative constructions. Moving from Example 2 A to 2B, a transitive construction becomes a causative construction by the affixation of the causative morpheme ‚Äú-√µ‚Äù. Here, the subject of the verb in part A becomes the causer of the verb in part B. Example 2A: o-so-a-t 1s-see-THEM-past 'He saw me' Example 2B: o-√µ- so-a-t 1s-CAU-see-THEM-past 'He showed me (to someone)' (Txt) The comitative- causative increases valency and is formed by the addition of the prefix ‚Äú-ese‚Äù. This increases verb valency through the transformation of intransitive verb stems into transitive verb stems. It differs from the simple causative, because the causer not only causes the causee to perform the action stated by the predicate, but the causer also performs this action at the same time as the causee. For example, a person bringing an object to a specific location not only causes the object to arrive someplace, that person (the causer) arrives too. Important to note is that the causative comitative morpheme is different from the simple comitative; the former being a derivational affix applied to verb stems and the latter a postpositional clitic taking a noun phrase as its object (Galucio: 2001, 99). In Example 3 A, the morpheme ‚Äú-ese‚Äù is added to the verb, inducing the comitative causative form. Example 3A: s-ese-p…®bor-a-ra √µt 3s-COM-arrive-THEM-Resum I 'I arrived again bringing it'/'I arrived again with it' The transitivizer in Mek√©ns increases valency. It works by applying the suffix ‚Äú-ka‚Äù to adjective and uninflectible verb stems, creating transitive verb stems. Moving from Example 4A to 4B, ‚Äú-ka‚Äù is added to an adjective stem ‚Äúperop‚Äù (beans). When the object and/or subject is unspecified or implicitly known in a sentence, uninflectible verbs are normally employed. Example 4A: kobo perop bean cooked ‚Äòcooked beans‚Äô Example 4B: kobo perop-ka-t beans cooked-TR-past ‚Äòhe/she cooked the beans‚Äô The second transitivizer suffix, ‚Äú-kwa‚Äù, is similar to ‚Äú-ka‚Äù, in that it creates transitive verb stems from adjective and uninflectible verb stems (Galucio, 2001, 101). However, it may also create transitive verb stems from nouns. Moving from Example 4C to 4D, the noun ‚Äúpan‚Äù described by the adjective ‚Äúblack‚Äù is augmented by the addition of ‚Äú-kwa‚Äù. This allows for both the implicitly stated subject ‚Äúhe/she‚Äù and the object ‚Äúme‚Äù to be introduced. Example 4C: ≈ãw√£·∫Ω p…®…®k pan black ‚Äòblack pan‚Äô Example 4D: o-p…®…®k-kwa-ra 1s-black-TR+pl-Rep ‚Äò(He/she) completely painted me black again' Valency decrease in Mek√©ns is achieved by use of the intransitivizer, and is formed by applying the intransitivizer prefix ‚Äúe-‚Äú to transitive verb forms, thus creating intransitive verb stems. The addition of this prefix to the transitive verb also creates morphological causativization. In Example 5A, the noun ‚Äúbanana‚Äù is described by the adjective ‚Äúripe‚Äù. In 5B, the instransitivizer ‚Äúe-‚Äú is subsequently applied, introducing causation to the sentence, in an intransitive construction. There is only one argument in the sentence, (bananas), which is the causee, since it is receiving the action of the verb ‚Äúripe‚Äù. Example 5A: apara saro banana yellow ‚ÄòRipe banana‚Äô Example 5B: se-e-saro-ka te apara 3c-Intrvzr-yellow-TR- foc banana ‚ÄòThe bananas are getting ripe‚Äô ==Plurals== The plural in Mek√©ns is achieved by attaching a morpheme to nouns, pronouns, verbs and auxiliaries. The morpheme and collective clitic ‚Äú-iat‚Äù is the most commonly used plural morpheme in the language, being attached to all of the above lexical categories, except for verbs, in which case ‚Äú-kwa‚Äù is attached. The morpheme ‚Äú-iat‚Äù may be used to indicate plurality in either a standard or collective sense. This is to say, in the standard sense it denotes more than one object or entity belonging to the same category, and in the collective sense it denotes a number of similar or different objects or entities, which together form a common group (Galucio: 2001, 29). The latter sense is the most common of the two, owing to the fact that the formal category of number (i.e. plural vs. singular) is not a general distinction in Mek√©ns (Galucio: 2001, 94). The morpheme ‚Äú-iat‚Äù is attached to nouns, which constitute an open class and may be specified for the grammatical category of number (Galucio: 2001, 29). There is no case, class or gender marking associated with nouns. There is, however, a number distinction: nouns may be marked as either singular or plural. Singular nouns, which constitute the default case, are unmarked. Plural nouns are marked by the collective clitic ‚Äú-iat‚Äù. Plural marking can be omitted if it is marked in other elements in a clause, such as the verb or demonstrative. The collective or plural form in nouns is marked to the right of the noun phrase and before other clitics. When a noun is altered by one or more adjective stems, the collective marker is usually inserted to the right of the last adjective stem, after the noun (seen in examples 1A and B). It may also be inserted to the right of the first adjective stem after the noun (seen in example 1D), and may sometimes attach directly to the noun, before the adjective stems (seen in example 1E). The collective morpheme is freer than the other affixes in Mek√©ns, since its scope extends over more than just a single world (Galucio: 2001, 95). It is therefore appropriate to consider this collective morpheme as a Noun Phrase modifier, like the postpositional clitics in the language. Examples 1E and 1F illustrate its scope over the entire noun phrase. In part a, it refers to a group of non-Indian young boys, and in example b, it refers to the group of ‚Äúnon-indian black guys‚Äù, and not just to the ‚Äúblack guys‚Äù. Example 1A: ≈ãw…ëÃÉ·∫Ω poor \\"the old pans\\" pan old Example 1B: ≈ãw…ëÃÉ·∫Ω poot no \\"other old pans\\" pan old other Example 1C: ≈ãw…ëÃÉ·∫Ω no poot \\"other old pans\\" pan other old Example 1D: pebo paak no ‚Äúother white (bird) wings wing white other Example 1E: ar·∫Ωp pagop-ta…®p [kwerep pagop ta…®b] se=poroka t √µet te then young-make non. indian young-male 3c-die. Them guess foc Example 1F: s-ike arop firmino p…®…®k [kwerep p…®…®g] 3s-older.brother that Firmino black non.indian black 'Then he was a young guy, one of the non-indian young guys, I don't know whether he died or not, his brother, Firmino, one of the non-indian black guys.' In the second personal plural, third personal plural and third person co-referential plural forms respectively, personal pronouns are marked by the collective clitic ‚Äú-iat‚Äù (Galucio: 2001, 38). Table 1 illustrates the use of the morpheme in the above forms. Note that the vowel ‚Äúi‚Äù changes to ‚Äúy‚Äù, when suffixed to personal pronouns. Table 1 - The Collective Clitic in Personal Pronouns: {  Person Personal Pronoun - 2nd-person plural eyat - 3rd-personal plural teyat - 3rd-person co-referential plural seteyat } In verbs, plurality may be marked in two ways - either through the application of the plural suffix ‚Äú-kwa‚Äù, or through stem alteration (Galucio: 2001, 54). In example 2A, the ‚Äú-kwa‚Äù suffix is attached to the verb to indicate the killing of more than one person. In stem alteration, ‚Äúone verb is used for a singular argument, and a different verb is used for a plural argument‚Äù (Galucio: 2001, 55). This is demonstrated in example 2B. Example 2A: se-no mi- kwa p√£√£t 3c-other kill-pl like 'He likes to kill others' Example 2B: seteyat- set se-teg-√µ kwa i-et i-et 3pl-go 3c-house-Dat go/come.pl.Subj 3-Aux.in.motion.pl 'They left, they are going home/to their own house' With auxiliaries, the plurality of their argument is expressed with the clitic ‚Äú-iat‚Äù. In examples 3A and 3B, the third personal plural is implied, although there is no indication of person after the auxiliary-plural word (Galucio: 2001, 60). When there is no marking for person in transitive verb stems, this indicates the third person. Furthermore, as seen in example 3B, when other overt plural markers are present, the third personal singular coreferential prefix takes a plural reference (Galucio: 2001, 61). In example 3C, there is no marking of person in neither the lexical verb nor the auxiliary; the person/number of the argument is indicated only by the use of morpheme ‚Äú-iat‚Äù, which is suffixed to the auxiliary. The sentence is therefore interpreted as having a third-person plural subject. Moving to example 3D, the sentence has a first person plural subject, seen after the ‚Äú-iat‚Äù morpheme. Example 3A: teyat-er-a naat tob 3p-sleep-Them ? Aux.lying 'They are already sleeping' Example 3B: se-er-a naat tob 3c-sleep-Them ? Aux. lying 'They are already sleeping' Example 3C: t…üero ma naat kob chicha make ? Aux. moving 'They are making chicha‚Äô Example 3D: t…®ero ma naat kob chicha make ? Aux. moving 'We (excl) are making chicha' ==Works cited== * De Sousa Le√£o, S. (2013). Dicion√°rio Sakurabiat.

Person pronouns, which follow the verb (either cliticizing to it or not) are nominative: they may encode the sole argument of an intransitive verb (S) or the agent argument of a transitive verb (A), but not the patient of a transitive verb (P).

In 1956, the Minister of Internal Affairs Nikolai Dudorov decided to improve the regional management and on May 9, 1956 he signed an internal decree No. 071, which was formed two independent department: The Department of Internal Affairs of Moscow with its center at Petrovka 38, and the Moscow region police department with a focus on Belinsky street, 3 (now Nikita Lane, 3). The first chief of the Moscow region police department became Commissioner Yegorov Ryasno. On July 5, 1956, he was dismissed from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR on the facts of defamation. Instead of him, was appointed Commissioner Grigory Ivanovich Kalinin, who led the department until 1959. During the next 10 years (1959‚Äì1969) the Department of Internal Affairs of the Moscow Region was led by Commissioner Sergey A. Vasiliev. Next up in 1984 to the post of head of department was appointed Lieutenant-General Vasily Konstantinovich Tsepkov, who previously worked as head of the department of administrative organs of the CPSU. Under him, in 1978 (Order of the Ministry of the Interior March 10, 1978 No. 0122) was reorganized Department of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region to the main Department of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region (in order to raise the profile and the increasing number of officers). Under his leadership, was opened a museum of history of Moscow region police, and began to build a training corps training school junior and middle commanding structure, which opened in 1975 (now a training center in the village Rastorguevo, in Leninsky Municipal District of Moscow Oblast). After retiring, Tsepkova was replaced by Ivan Shilov, police chief who has worked in the Moscow Region 1984‚Äì1988 years, previously worked at the central office of MVD. From 1988 to 1994 he headed the Directorate alongside former chief of Egoryevskaya police, Lieutenant- General Constantine Maksimovich Bellin. From 1994 to 1995 he was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav V. Ogorodnikov, who previously worked in Istra, Naro-Fominsk, and fought in Afghanistan. From 1995 to 1999, the head of the Moscow region police department was a former deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Colonel-General Alexander Kulikov. Next up in 2001 the police department was led by Major General Yuri Ivanovich Yukhman. From 2001 the head of Moscow region police is the colonel-general Nikolai V.

He proclaimed himself the leader of the National Committee for Recovering Democracy and Restoring the State (CNRDRE). Sanogo was also said to be involved in the arrest and resignation of acting Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra in December 2012, leading to the appointment of civil servant Django Sissoko as Prime Minister. According to Human Rights Watch, Sanogo‚Äôs forces were implicated in serious human rights abuses including torture, sexual abuse, and intimidation against journalists and family members of detained soldiers.Mali: Security Forces ‚ÄòDisappear‚Äô 20, Torture Others Crackdown on People Linked to Counter-Coup, Journalists (JULY 25, 2012) Human Rights Watch. Retrieved February 11, 2013. ==Early and personal life== Sanogo is one of six children born to Mamadou Sanogo and his wife. Amadou Sanogo is nicknamed \\"Bolly\\" by relatives. Sanogo comes from S√©gou, one of Mali's largest cities on the Niger River. Sanogo has spent 22 years in the Malian Armed Forces. Before the coup, Sanogo had held a mid-level army position. A participant in the International Military Education and Training program, he received training \\"at training programmes in the United States, in Georgia and at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia\\", but his American instructors \\"never marked him out as future leadership material\\". He also studied English language at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. ==CRNDRE== His first actions as de facto head of state included suspending the constitution and activities of some organizations, as well as declaring a curfew and closing the borders. Though the rationale for the coup had been Amadou Toumani Tour√©'s alleged mismanagement of the 2012 Tuareg rebellion, the Malian military lost control of the regional capitals of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu within ten days of Sanogo's assuming office, leading Reuters to describe the coup as \\"a spectacular own-goal\\". On 4 April, The New York Times reported that he was trying to deflect attention from the coup to the struggles in the north, telling a reporter, \\"We should forget a little the Committee, the Parliament, the Constitution ‚Äî that can wait. The serious topic, it‚Äôs the north. That‚Äôs the most important.\\" Following the economic sanctions and a blockade by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on the country, a deal, brokered in Burkina Faso by President Blaise Compaor√© under the auspices of ECOWAS, was signed that would see Sanogo cede power to Dioncounda Traor√©, who would assume the presidency in an interim capacity until an election could be held. After the new interim President Dioncounda Traor√© and Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra took office, the junta led by Sanogo made it clear that they were stepping aside only temporarily and that the junta would retain a supervisory role until the elections. ECOWAS gave the interim government one year to hold elections. On 24 November 2012, Sanogo joined Malian religious leaders to speak at a Bamako rally against religious extremism. On 11 December 2012, Prime Minister Modibo Diarra was arrested by Sanogo's junta and forced to resign.\\"Mali PM Cheick Modibo Diarra resigns after army arrest\\", BBC News, 11 December 2012.

The concept of the Pok√©mon universe, in both the fictional works and the general nonfictional world of Pok√©mon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Pok√©mon creator Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child., TimeAsia (Waybacked). Players of the video games are designated as Pok√©mon Trainers and the two general goals (in most Pok√©mon games) for such Trainers are: to complete the Pok√©dex by collecting all of the available Pok√©mon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place and to train a team of powerful Pok√©mon to compete against teams owned by other Trainers and eventually become the strongest Trainer: the Pok√©mon Champion. These themes of collecting, training and battling are present in almost every version of the Pok√©mon franchise, including the video game series, the anime series, the manga series, the film series and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Although Pok√©mon battles between Trainers is popular in the Pok√©mon universe, the series also emphasizes the harmony between people and Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon battles are treated like a competitive sport where both Pok√©mon and humans have fun. Pok√©mon rarely sustain fatal injuries during these battles and they also can obtain remedies for their ailments in a Pok√©mon Center, a specialized hospital for Pok√©mon. ==Regions== There are several regions that have appeared in the various media of the Pok√©mon franchise. Each of the eight generations of the main series releases focuses on a new region. Moreover, several regions have been introduced in spin-off games and two in the Pok√©mon anime, though most of these are still within the same fictional universe. Usually, the different regions are not accessible from one another via land (or at all within a single game). However, Kanto can be accessed from Johto and vice versa via the sea in Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and SoulSilver versions. Every region consists of several cities and towns that the player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges, such as Gyms, Contests and villainous teams. At different locations within each region, the player can find different types of Pok√©mon, as well as helpful items and characters. Many regions are on separate continents with the earlier introduced regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh) being based on parts of Japan, with later regions being based on parts of the United States (Unova and Alola), France (Kalos) and the United Kingdom (Galar). Kanto The Kanto region is the setting of Pok√©mon Red, Blue and Yellow and their remakes, Pok√©mon FireRed, LeafGreen, Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!. Based on the real-life Kant≈ç region of Japan, this setting started the precedent of basing the geography and culture of the game's region on a real world setting. This region is also visited in Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and SoulSilver. Sevii Islands Johto The Johto region is the setting of the second generation of Pok√©mon games, which includes Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, Crystal and their remakes, Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Again based on an area of Japan, this game's geography is based upon the Kansai, Tokai and eastern Shikoku areas of the country.

Then, at the center of the chaos, an egg appeared, from which hatched Arceus. Arceus then created Dialga, the embodiment of time, Palkia, the embodiment of space, and Giratina, the embodiment of antimatter, who was banished to another dimension. Arceus then created Azelf, Mesprit and Uxie; the spirits of willpower, emotion and knowledge respectively. At this early time, Mew the ancestor of Pok√©mon, appeared in the universe. After creating the Pok√©mon Earth, Arceus went into an eternal sleep. After Arceus' creation, Groudon, embodiment of the land; Kyogre, embodiment of the sea; and Rayquaza, embodiment of the sky; were born. They are sometimes unofficially known as \\"the weather trio\\", as each of these Pok√©mon possess weather-changing abilities. The clash of these three Pok√©mon was said to have created much of the Earth's surface. Mt. Coronet was created at this point of time as Regigigas moved landmass to form continents and regions. Stark Mountain and Heatran were also created at this time. Many years after, the prehistoric era began and the first prehistoric Pok√©mon came into being. The games state that scientists proved that prehistoric Pok√©mon roamed the land, as Fossils and other paleontological remains have been found to contain the DNA of Pok√©mon. The Mew population on the planet may have decreased at this stage, as they slowly gave way to other Pok√©mon species.  Evolution  According to myths of Sinnoh, Pok√©mon and people were originally the same species. Mew is the ancestor of all Pok√©mon, and the first human recording was in the Stone Age, millions of years before the modern era. ==Works== Video game series *Pok√©mon video game series *List of Pok√©mon video games Animated series and films *Pok√©mon television series *Pok√©mon film series Card game and board game *Pok√©mon Trading Card Game *Pok√©mon Trading Figure Game Books and manga *Pok√©mon Junior (books) *Pok√©mon manga Detective Pikachu game and film *Detective Pikachu (video game) *Pok√©mon: Detective Pikachu (live-action film) ==References== Universe Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1996 Category:Video game locations Category:Fictional universes ","title":"Pok√©mon universe"},{"id":"35181742","text":"Coleophora mirabibella is a moth of the family Coleophoridae.

The film has been said to open a window to the world of the disabled. During the film the band rises from total obscurity to become a small phenomenon and they also get to travel outside Finland. The movie has an upbeat tone and it has been compared to another band documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil. == Awards == In Finland, The Punk Syndrome won the Audience Award at Tampere Film Festival in 2012 and the Jussi Award for the best documentary film in 2013.

Nielsen replied: \\"That's the first time I've heard about that. But it wasn't \\"I Can't Take It\\". He did write \\"Reach Out\\" which was on the Heavy Metal movie soundtrack. But he wrote that song with a guy named Bob James. He originally told us he had written it, but we later found out, he didn't write it (alone).\\" Speaking to Punk Globe in 2012, drummer Bun E.

AllMusic said: \\"The bright surfaces with the guitars and keyboards melding so tightly with the vocal harmonies they‚Äôre inseparable, produce a sound that is uncannily reminiscent of Oops! Wrong Planet, but Rundgren also helps keep an eye on quality control, letting Robin Zander's terrific \\"I Can't Take It\\" open the album\\". In a review of the 1996 box-set Sex, America, Cheap Trick, Billboard described the song as a \\"Beatlesque gem\\". In the 2007 book Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Power Pop Guide, author John M. Borack picked the song as one of twenty stand-out tracks from the band's career. He wrote: \\"This is pure, unfiltered power pop for the masses, with Todd Rundgren's bright 'n' shiny production, giving it a radio-friendly sheen. One of the great, semi- lost Cheap Trick numbers, and one they still perform live.\\" ==Cover versions== *In 2011, Todd Rundgren released his own version of the song on his 2011 solo album (re)Production. ==Track listing== ;7\\" single #\\"I Can't Take It\\" - 3:26 #\\"You Talk Too Much\\" - 1:55 ;7\\" single (US promo) #\\"I Can't Take It\\" - 3:26 #\\"I Can't Take It\\" - 3:26 ==Personnel== ;Cheap Trick * Robin Zander - lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Rick Nielsen - lead guitar, backing vocals * Jon Brant - bass, backing vocals * Bun E.

It is about a has-been pop star who is now a radio DJ struggling to boost listener ratings. It was released in theaters on January 5, 2012 by distributor Showbox/Mediaplex, and ran for 120 minutes. ==Plot== Shin Jin-ah (Lee Min-jung), a onetime lead singer of popular girl group Purple, works as the DJ of the radio show \\"Wonderful Radio\\" on SBS station Power FM while also trying to restart her career as a solo singer-composer under her goofy manager Cha Dae-geun (Lee Kwang-soo). However, the ratings have been dropping, so when the show's producer leaves to have a baby, station manager Im (Kim Byung-ok) assigns the ambitious Lee Jae-hyeok (Lee Jung-jin) to her job with a brief to bring in some fresh ideas. Jae-hyeok is appalled by Jin-ah's casual, diva-ish work attitude and the two don't hit it off. When he challenges her to come up with a new segment for the show, she finally gets an idea from her restaurateur mother (Kim Hae-sook) in which members of the public come into the studio and sing a song to their loved ones. She calls the segment \\"The Song I Sing to You\\". The initial broadcast, involving a serving soldier, goes disastrously, but subsequent attempts, involving a brattish schoolgirl (Jo Jung-eun) and a taxi driver (Jung Man-shik), are a big success. Jin-ah and Jae-hyeok start to bond. However, In-seok (Kim Jung-tae), the manager of TV drama actress Yoon Mi-ra (Seo Young) and a major supplier of talent to the radio station, is plotting to bring Jin-ah down and replace her with Mi-ra, who still hates Jin- ah for leaving Purple at the height of its fame and causing the group's break- up. ==Cast== * Lee Min-jung - Shin Jin-ah * Lee Jung-jin - Lee Jae-hyeok * Lee Kwang-soo - Cha Dae-geun, Jin-ah's manager * Kim Hae-sook - Mrs. Lee, Jin-ah's mother * Kim Jung-tae - In-seok, head of Mi-ra's agency * Kim Byeong-ok - Director Im, Power FM station manager * Han Yeo-woon - Ji In-yeong * Seo Young - Yoon Mi-ra * Jeong Yu-mi - Nan-sol, show scriptwriter * Jung Man-sik - Ji- hyeong, taxi driver * Jo Jung-eun - Yoon Da-hee, schoolgirl * Kim Tae-won - Music bar owner (cameo) * Lee Seung-hwan - Dream Factory owner (cameo) * Dal Shabet - Cobi Girls (cameo) * Cul Two - guys in the elevator (cameo) * Jung Yup - (cameo) * Kim Jong-kook - taxi passenger (cameo) * Gary - taxi passenger (cameo) ==Production== The director of Wonderful Radio is Kwon Chil-in, who previously directed Singles (2003), Hellcats (2008) and Loveholic (2010).

Lee Min-jung said she enjoyed playing both a singer and radio DJ, basing her performance on popular idol groups in her schooldays such as S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. She also said she drew inspiration from her own childhood experience as an avid fan of radio shows, when she would laugh and cry at hearing peoples' stories broadcast over the airwaves. ==Soundtrack== The instrumental score was composed by Jung Soo-min and Hwang Seong-je.

It was first described in 2012 on the basis of systematic DNA barcoding of specimens from the genus Brunfelsia. Specimens belonging to the new species had previously been placed in the polymorphic species B. uniflora, which a molecular phylogeny revealed as polyphyletic. == Etymology == The species was named in honor of the American botanist Timothy Plowman (1944-1989) who had worked on neotropical plants of ethnobotanic importance and provided the first and only comprehensive taxonomic treatments of the genus Brunfelsia.Plowman TC (1978) In: Hawkes JG (Ed). Systematic notes on the Solanaceae. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 76: 294-295. Plowman TC (1979) The genus Brunfelsia: a conspectus of the taxonomy and biogeography. In: Hawkes JG, Lester RN, Skelding AD (Eds). The Biology and Taxonomy of the Solanaceae. Academic Press, London: 475-491.Plowman, T.C. (ed. S. Knapp & J.R. Press). 1998. A revision of the South American species of Brunfelsia (Solanaceae). Fieldiana, Botany. n.s. 39, 1-135. (archived at the Internet Archive) == Molecular diagnosis == The new species differs from all other species of Brunfelsia at several nucleotide positions in the plastid ndhF gene and in the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region. == Description == The shrubs or small trees mostly have a single stem of up to 14 cm in diameter at the base, and they branch only above the base, typically 1‚Äì4 m and sometimes up to 10 m high. The bark is peeling or flaking, light gray or yellow-brown. Branches with the new twigs are densely covered with up to 0.3 mm long hairs, whereas the older branches exhibit a smooth and glabrous bark. Internodes range from 4‚Äì12 mm. The shiny and dark green leaves are scattered along the branchlets and often also covered with hairs, especially on younger twigs. They vary in size and shape, but are usually widest above the middle with a rather abruptly narrowed apex, similar to many Myrtaceae. The raised and somewhat cartilaginous ring of the corolla throat is reminiscent of that of species of Prestonia (Apocynaceae) from the same geographic region; it probably reflects adaptation to pollinator foraging behaviour. Nothing is known directly of the pollinators, but the floral features described above are shared by other South American brunfelsias for which butterfly pollination has been observed. The stomata are paracytic. The flower is solitary, terminal and often nodding, fragrant during the day. Both sepals and petals are partially fused and the latter colored violet, though the color fades to white with age, as is common in the South American species of Brunfelsia. The four stamens are adnate to the corolla, and the ovary is bicarpellate and syncarpous. The fruit is obovoid, coriaceous and capsular and reaches about 1 cm in diameter. It is probably green, and perhaps turning dark purple or black when ripe. There are ca. 9 ovoid seeds of about 6 mm in length. There are no observations on fully mature fruits or dispersal of the seeds. Herbarium specimens with ripe or nearly ripe fruits always show them splitting neatly from the top about 1/3 of the way to the base into two equal valves. == Distribution == Distribution map of Brunfelsia plowmaniana. Brunfelsia plowmaniana is known from humid forests in the Provinces of Salta and Jujuy in northwestern Argentina, and the Departments of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and La Paz (Inquisivi Province) in Bolivia. It grows at altitudes of 1500‚Äì3200 m on the predominantly North‚ÄìSouth ridges separated by dry to arid scrub in the intervening valleys, perhaps mostly at the lower altitudinal range in the southern part of the distribution and the upper altitudinal range to the north. It has never been collected in the neighbouring Provinces of Sud Yungas, Nor Yungas and Larecaja in the relatively well-explored central and northern parts of the Department of La Paz. == Habitat == Brunfelsia plowmaniana lives exclusively in Andean humid or cloud forests and shares its habitat with tree ferns like Dicksonia sellowiana as well as with members of the Podocarpaceae, Betulaceae, Cunoniaceae, Myrtaceae, Clethraceae and Caprifoliaceae families and numerous other Solanaceae. About one in three specimens of Brunfelsia plowmaniana is closely associated with epiphytic lichens, mosses and liverworts, reflecting the cloud forest habitat. == Conservation status == The species is often found in heavily grazed lower edges of the cloud forest where grazing, deforestation and fires are a threat to local populations. Even though the range is narrow, it is about 800 km long; and many populations are in undisturbed or protected areas. == References  External links == *Treebase entry with the data underlying the phylogeny *Species ID plowmaniana Category:Flora of Argentina Category:Flora of Bolivia Category:Plants described in 2012 ","title":"Brunfelsia plowmaniana"},{"id":"35182517","text":"ƒê√†o VƒÉn Phong (born June 6, 1985, in Vietnam) is a Vietnamese footballer who is a left back for V.League 1 side Sanna Kh√°nh H√≤a BVN.

Astronomical searches investigate whether light and neutrinos emitted simultaneously from a distant source are arriving simultaneously on Earth. Terrestrial searches include time of flight measurements using synchronized clocks, and direct comparison of neutrino speed with the speed of other particles. Since it is established that neutrinos possess mass, the speed of neutrinos of kinetic energies ranging from MeV to GeV should be slightly lower than the speed of light in accordance with special relativity. Existing measurements provided upper limits for deviations of approximately 10‚àí9, or a few parts per billion. Within the margin of error this is consistent with no deviation at all. == Overview == Neutrino speed as a function of relativistic kinetic energy, with neutrino mass < 0.2 eV/c¬≤. { class=  style=\\"border-right:2px solid black\\" Energy10 eV1 KeV1 MeV1 GeV1 TeV - style=\\"border-right:2px solid black; padding-right:10px;\\" v-c/c\\\\scriptstyle \\\\lesssim10^{-4}\\\\scriptstyle\\\\lesssim10^{-8}\\\\scriptstyle\\\\lesssim10^{-14}\\\\scriptstyle\\\\lesssim10^{-20}\\\\scriptstyle\\\\lesssim10^{-26} } It was assumed for a long time in the framework of the standard model of particle physics, that neutrinos are massless. Thus they should travel at exactly the speed of light according to special relativity. However, since the discovery of neutrino oscillations it is assumed that they possess some small amount of mass. Thus they should travel slightly slower than the speed of light, otherwise their relativistic energy would become infinitely large. This energy is given by the formula: :E=\\\\frac{mc^{2}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}, with v being the neutrino speed and c the speed of light. The neutrino mass m is currently estimated as being 2 eV/c¬≤, and is possibly even lower than 0.2 eV/c¬≤. According to the latter mass value and the formula for relativistic energy, relative speed differences between light and neutrinos are smaller at high energies, and should arise as indicated in the figure on the right. Time-of-flight measurements conducted so far investigated neutrinos of energy above 10 MeV. However, velocity differences predicted by relativity at such high energies cannot be determined with the current precision of time measurement. The reason why such measurements are still conducted, is connected with the theoretical possibility that significantly larger deviations from light speed might arise under certain circumstances. For instance, it was postulated that neutrinos might be some sort of superluminal particles called tachyons, even though others criticized this proposal. While hypothetical tachyons are thought to be compatible with Lorentz invariance, superluminal neutrinos have also been studied in Lorentz invariance violating frameworks as motivated by speculative variants of quantum gravity, such as the Standard-Model Extension according to which Lorentz-violating neutrino oscillations can arise. Besides time-of-flight measurements, those models also allow for indirect determinations of neutrino speed and other modern searches for Lorentz violation. All of those experiments confirmed Lorentz invariance and special relativity. == Fermilab (1970s) == Fermilab conducted in the 1970s a series of terrestrial measurements, in which the speed of muons was compared with that of neutrinos and antineutrinos of energies between 30 and 200 GeV. The Fermilab narrow band neutrino beam was generated as follows: 400-GeV protons are hitting the target and causing the production of secondary beams consisting of pions and kaons. Then they are decaying in an evacuated decay tube of 235 meter length. The remaining hadrons were stopped by a secondary dump, so that only neutrinos and some energetic muons can penetrate the earth- and steel shield of 500 meter length, in order to reach the particle detector. Since the protons are transferred in bunches of one nanosecond duration at an interval of 18.73 ns, the speed of muons and neutrinos could be determined. A speed difference would lead to an elongation of the neutrino bunches and to a displacement of the whole neutrino time spectrum. At first, the speeds of muons and neutrinos were compared. Later, also antineutrinos were observed. The upper limit for deviations from light speed was: :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<4\\\\times10^{-5}. This was in agreement with the speed of light within the measurement accuracy (95% confidence level), and also no energy dependence of neutrino speeds could be found at this accuracy. == Supernova 1987A == The most precise agreement with the speed of light () was determined in 1987 by the observation of electron antineutrinos of energies between 7.5 and 35 MeV originated at the Supernova 1987A at a distance of 157000 ¬± 16000 light years. The upper limit for deviations from light speed was: :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<2\\\\times10^{-9}, thus 1.000000002 times the speed of light. This value was obtained by comparing the arrival times of light and neutrinos. The difference of approximately three hours was explained by the circumstance, that the almost noninteracting neutrinos could pass the supernova unhindered while light required a longer time. == MINOS (2007) == The first terrestrial measurement of the absolute transit time was conducted by MINOS (2007) at Fermilab. In order to generate neutrinos (the so-called NuMI beam) they used the Fermilab Main Injector, by which 120-GeV-protons were directed to a graphite target in 5 to 6 batches per spill. The emerging mesons decayed in a 675 meter long decay tunnel into muon neutrinos (93%) and muon antineutrinos (6%). The travel time was determined by comparing the arrival times at the MINOS near- and far detector, apart from each other by 734 km. The clocks of both stations were synchronized by GPS, and long optical fibers were used for signal transmission. They measured an early neutrino arrival of approximately 126 ns. Thus the relative speed difference was \\\\scriptstyle (5.1\\\\pm2.9)\\\\times10^{-5} (68% confidence limit). This corresponds to 1.000051¬±29 times the speed of light, thus apparently faster than light. The major source of error were uncertainties in the fiber optic delays. The statistical significance of this result was less than 1.8œÉ, thus it was not significant since 5œÉ is required to be accepted as a scientific discovery. At 99% confidence level it was given :-2.4\\\\times10^{-5}<\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<12.6\\\\times10^{-5}, a neutrino speed larger than 0.999976c and lower than 1.000126c. Thus the result is also compatible with subluminal speeds. == OPERA (2011, 2012) ==  Anomaly  In the OPERA experiment, 17-GeV neutrinos have been used, split in proton extractions of 10,5 ¬µs length generated at CERN, which hit a target at a distance of 743 km. Then pions and kaons are produced which partially decayed into muons and muon neutrinos (CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso, CNGS). The neutrinos traveled further to the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) 730 km away, where the OPERA detector is located. GPS was used to synchronize the clocks and to determine the exact distance. In addition, optical fibers were used for signal transmission at LNGS. The temporal distribution of the proton extractions was statistically compared with approximately 16000 neutrino events. OPERA measured an early neutrinos arrival of approximately 60 nanoseconds, as compared to the expected arrival at the speed of light, thus indicating a neutrino speed faster than that of light. Contrary to the MINOS result, the deviation was 6œÉ and thus apparently significant. To exclude possible statistical errors, CERN produced bunched proton beams between October and November 2011. The proton extractions were split into short bunches of 3 ns at intervals of 524 ns, so that every neutrino event could be directly connected to a proton bunch. The measurement of twenty neutrino events again gave an early arrival of about 62 ns, in agreement with the previous result. They updated their analysis and increased the significance up to 6,2œÉ. In February and March 2012, it was shown that there were two mistakes in the experimental equipment: An erroneous cable connection at a computer card, making the neutrinos appearing faster than expected. The other one was an oscillator out of its specification, making the neutrinos appearing slower than expected. Then the time of arrival of cosmic high-energy muons at OPERA and the co- located LVD detector between 2007‚Äì2008, 2008‚Äì2011, and 2011‚Äì2012 were compared. It was found out that between 2008‚Äì2011, the cable connector error caused a deviation of approximately 73 ns, and the oscillator error caused ca. 15 ns in the opposite direction.LNGS seminar (28 March 2012): LNGS results on the neutrino velocity topic. This and the measurement of neutrino velocities consistent with the speed of light by the ICARUS collaboration (see ICARUS (2012)), indicated that the neutrinos were actually not faster than light.  End result  Finally, in July 2012 the OPERA collaboration published a new analysis of their data from 2009‚Äì2011, which included the instrumental effects stated above, and obtained bounds for arrival time differences (compared to the speed of light): :\\\\delta t=6.5\\\\pm7.4\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}){\\\\scriptstyle {+8.3\\\\atop -8.0}}\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, and bounds for speed differences: :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}=(2.7\\\\pm3.1\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}){\\\\scriptstyle {+3.4\\\\atop -3.3}}\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}))\\\\times10^{-6}. Also the corresponding new analysis for the bunched beam of October and November 2011 agreed with this result: :\\\\delta t=-1.9\\\\pm3.7\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) nanoseconds All of those results are consistent with the speed of light, and the 10^{-6} bound for the speed difference is more precise by one order of magnitude than previous terrestrial time-of-flight measurements. == LNGS (2012) == Continuing the OPERA and ICARUS measurements, the LNGS experiments Borexino, LVD, OPERA and ICARUS conducted new tests between 10 and 24 May 2012, after CERN provided another bunched beam rerun. All measurements were consistent with the speed of light. The 17-GeV muon neutrino beam consisted of 4 batches per extraction separated by ~300ns, and the batches consisted of 16 bunches separated by ~100ns, with a bunch width of ~2ns.  Borexino  The Borexino collaboration analyzed both the bunched beam rerun of Oct.‚ÄìNov. 2011 and the second rerun of May 2012. For the 2011 data, they evaluated 36 neutrino events and obtained an upper limit for time of flight differences: :\\\\delta t=-6.5\\\\pm7\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm6\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds. For the May 2012 measurements, they improved their equipment by installing a new analogue small‚Äìjitter triggering system and a geodetic GPS receiver coupled to a Rb clock. They also conducted an independent high precision geodesy measurement together with LVD and ICARUS. 62 neutrino events could be used for the final analysis, giving a more precise upper limit for time of flight differences :\\\\delta t=0.8\\\\pm0.7\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm2.9\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, corresponding to :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<2.1\\\\times10^{-6} (90% C.L.).  LVD  The LVD collaboration first analyzed the beam rerun of Oct.‚ÄìNov. 2011. They evaluated 32 neutrino events and obtained an upper limit for time of flight differences: :\\\\delta t=3.1\\\\pm5.3\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm8\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds. In the May 2012 measurements, they used the new LNGS timing facility by the Borexino collaboration, and the geodetic data obtained by LVD, Borexino, and ICARUS (see above). They also updated their Scintillation counters and the trigger. 48 neutrino events (at energies above 50 MeV, average neutrino energy was 17 GeV) have been used for the May analysis, improving the upper limit for time of flight differences :\\\\delta t=0.9\\\\pm0.6\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm3.2\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, corresponding to :-3.8\\\\times10^{-6}<\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<3.1\\\\times10^{-6} (99% C.L.).  ICARUS  After publishing the analysis of the beam rerun of Oct.‚ÄìNov. 2011 (see above), the ICARUS collaboration also provided an analysis of the May rerun. They substantially improved their own internal timing system and between CERN-LNGS, used the geodetic LNGS measurement together with Borexino and LVD, and employed Borexino's timing facility. 25 neutrino events have been evaluated for the final analysis, yielding an upper limit for time of flight differences: :\\\\delta t=0.18\\\\pm0.69\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm2.17\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, corresponding to :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}=(0.7\\\\pm2.8\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.})\\\\pm8.9\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}))\\\\times10^{-7}. Neutrino velocities exceeding the speed of light by more than 1.6\\\\times10^{-6}c (95% C.L.) are excluded.  OPERA  After the correction of the initial results, OPERA published their May 2012 measurements as well. An additional, independent timing system and four different methods of analysis were used for the evaluation of the neutrino events. They provided an upper limit for time of flight differences between light and muon neutrinos (48 to 59 neutrino events depending on the method of analysis): :\\\\delta t=0.6\\\\pm0.4\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm3.0\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, and between light and anti-muon neutrinos (3 neutrino events): :\\\\delta t=1.7\\\\pm1.4\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm3.2\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, consistent with the speed of light in the range of :-1.8\\\\times10^{-6}<\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<2.3\\\\times10^{-6} (90% C. L.). == MINOS (2012) ==  Old timing system  The MINOS collaboration further elaborated on their speed measurements of 2007. They examined the data collected over seven years, improved the GPS timing system and the understanding of the delays of electronic components, and also used upgraded timing equipment. The neutrinos span a 10 Œºs spill containing 5-6 batches. The analyses have been conducted in two ways. First, as in the 2007 measurement, the data at the far detector was statistically determined by the data of the near detector (\\"Full Spill Approach\\"): :\\\\delta t=-18\\\\pm11\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm29\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, Second, the data connected with the batches themselves have been used (\\"Wrapped Spill Approach\\"): :\\\\delta t=-11\\\\pm11\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm29\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, This is consistent with neutrinos traveling at the speed of light, and substantially improves their preliminary 2007 results.  New timing system  In order to further improve the precision, a new timing system was developed. In particular, a \\"Resistive Wall Current Monitor\\" (RWCM) measuring the time distribution of the proton beam, CS atomic clocks, dual frequency GPS receivers, and auxiliary detectors to measure detector latencies have been installed. For the analysis, the neutrino events could be connected with a specific 10Œºs proton spill, from which a likelihood analysis was generated, and then the likelihoods of different events have been combined. The result: :\\\\delta t=-2.4\\\\pm0.1\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{stat.}) \\\\pm2.6\\\\ (\\\\mathrm{sys.}) nanoseconds, and :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}=(1.0\\\\pm1.1)\\\\times10^{-6}. This was confirmed in the final publication in 2015. == Indirect determinations of neutrino speed == Lorentz violating frameworks such as the Standard-Model Extension including Lorentz-violating neutrino oscillations also allow for indirect determinations of deviations between light speed and neutrino speed by measuring their energy and the decay rates of other particles over large distances. By this method, much more stringent bounds can be obtained, such as by Stecker et al.: :\\\\frac{v-c}{c}<5.6\\\\times10^{-19}.

In 2001 a law was introduced by Senator Eduardo Suplicy of the Brazilian Workers Party which mandated the progressive institution of such a welfare system. By this move Brazil became the first country in the world to pass such a law. Suplicy had previously introduced a bill to create a Negative Income Tax, but that bill failed to pass. The new bill called for a national and universal basic income to be instituted, beginning with those most in need. The bill was approved by the Senate in 2002 and by the Chamber of Deputies in 2003. President Lula da Silva signed it into law in 2004,Lei N¬∫ 10.835, de 8 de Janeiro de 2004. Institui a renda b√°sica de cidadania e d√° outras provid√™ncias. and according to the bill it is the president's responsibility to gradually implement the reform. Since then Brazil has started to implement the bill through the Bolsa Fam√≠lia-program, which was a centerpiece of President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva's social policy, and is reputed to have played a role in his victory in the Brazilian presidential election, 2006. == Bolsa Fam√≠lia == Diadema Bolsa Fam√≠lia is a social welfare program of the Brazilian government. The program attempts to both reduce short-term poverty by direct cash transfers and fight long-term poverty by increasing human capital among the poor through conditional cash transfers. It also works to give free education to children who cannot afford to go to school to show the importance of education.Decree n¬∫ 5.209, de 17 de setembro de 2004 ‚Äì Regulates a Law-010.836-2004 ‚Äì Bolsa Fam√≠lia Program. The part of the program that is about direct welfare benefits could perhaps best be described as a basic income with some prerequisites. Families with children, to be eligible for the income, must ensure that their children attend school and have been vaccinated. The Bolsa Familia program has been mentioned as one factor contributing to the reduction of poverty in Brazil, which fell 27.7% during the first term in the Lula administration. About 12 million Brazilian families receive funds from Bolsa Fam√≠lia, which has been described as \\"the largest programme of its kind in the world.\\" By February 2011, 26% of the Brazilian population were covered by the program. As of March 2020, the program covers 13.8 million families, and pays an average of $34 per month, in a country where the minimum wage is $190 per month. The reaction from multilateral institutions to Bolsa Fam√≠lia has generally been enthusiastic. During a trip to Brazil in 2005, the former president of the World Bank, Paul Wolfowitz said, \\"Bolsa Familia has already become a highly praised model of effective social policy. Countries around the world are drawing lessons from Brazil‚Äôs experience and are trying to produce the same results for their own people.\\" News and Broadcast ‚Äì Brazil‚Äôs Bolsa Familia Program Celebrates Progress in Lifting Families out of Poverty Economic thinker and philosopher Joseph Heath praised the program in his 2010 book Economics without Illusions, citing it as an example of how to manage incentives of people whose poverty results from hyperbolic discounting. Heath wrote, \\"What makes programs such as this so successful is that they do not change people's incentives: They merely rearrange the temporal sequence in which these incentives are experienced. ... This has proven to be more valuable than a thousand recitations of the fable of the ant and the grasshopper.\\"  Criticism  However, the program is far from being universally accepted by Brazilian society. Among the various criticisms it receives, one of the most recurrent is the assertion that it could discourage the search for employment, encouraging laziness of people. Under this premise, many people would give up trying to find a job, content, instead, to live on the Bolsa Fam√≠lia program.http://www.democraticunderground.com/110817686\\"Lula and the poetry of misery\\", Reinaldo Azevedo, 29/7/09 The Catholic Church, through its powerful National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), maintains\\"An economic policy of the power of money for money\\", CNBB, 1 March 2010 \\"A Referendum\\" to divide farms?\\", CNBB, 27 July 2010 that \\"the program is addictive\\" and leads its beneficiaries to an \\"accommodation\\". This, however, is not what the World Bank finds. Having conducted several surveys on the subject, the World Bank came to the conclusion that the program does not discourage work, nor social ascension. On the contrary, says B√©n√©dicte de la Bri√®re, responsible for the program monitoring at the institution: ::\\"Adult work is not impacted by income transfers. In some cases adults will even work harder because having this safety net encourages them to assume greater risks in their activities\\"' BRAMATTI, Daniel. Banco Mundial v√™ Bolsa Fam√≠lia como modelo., S√£o Paulo: Pol√≠tica, Terra Magazine, Sep. 17, 2007, 08h18 Another criticism of the program is the fact that it is perceived by opponents of the currently ruling party as a program meant to \\"buy\\" votes of poor people, creating clientism.  Surveys and research  Surveys conducted by the Federal Government among Bolsa Fam√≠lia's beneficiaries indicate that the money is spent, in order of priority, on food; school supplies; clothing; and shoes.Bolsa Fam√≠lia, Perguntas e Respostas . Veja Online A study conducted by The Federal University of Pernambuco, using sophisticated statistical methods, inferred that 87% of the money is used, by families living in rural areas, to buy food.DUARTE, Gisl√©ia Benini, et al. Impactos do Programa Bolsa Fam√≠lia Sobre Os gastos Com Alimentos De Fam√≠lias Rurais According to research promoted by some universities and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) the program has clearly contributed to Brazil's recent improvements in its fight against poverty. An ex ante econometric evaluation of Bolsa Escola did find significant effects on both school attendance rates and the number of children involved in child labor.SSRN-Ex-ante Evaluation of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: The Case of Bolsa Escola by Francois Bourguignon, Francisco Ferreira, Phillippe Leite The World Bank, which provided a loan to assist the Brazilian government in managing the Bolsa Fam√≠lia Program, declares that \\"Although the program is relatively young, some results are already apparent, including: (...) contributions to improved education outcomes, and impacts on children‚Äôs growth, food consumption, and diet quality\\".Brazil‚Äôs Bolsa Familia Program Celebrates Progress in Lifting Families out of Poverty, News & Broadcast, The World Bank, Brasilia, Brazil, December 19, 2005 A study by the UNDP's International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growthhttp://www.ipc- undp.org/ found that over 80% of the Bolsa Familia benefits go to families in poverty (making under half the minimum wage per capita), thus most of the benefits go to the poor. Bolsa Familia was also found to have been responsible for about 20% of the drop in inequality in Brazil since 2001, which is welcome in one of the most unequal countries on the planet.untitled Research promoted by the World Bank shows a significant reduction in child labor exploitation among children benefited by the Bolsa Fam√≠lia program.YAP, Yoon-Tien, Guilherme Sedlacek and Peter Orazem. 2001. Limiting Child Labor Through Behavior-Based Income Transfers: An Experimental Evaluation of the PETI Program in Rural Brazil. World Bank, Washington, DC One positive effect of the program which is not immediately apparent is that it makes a significant impact on the ability of the poorest families to eat. Children in public schools receive one free meal a day‚Äîtwo in the poorest areas‚Äîand so less of their family's limited income is needed to pay for food. In a survey of Bolsa Familia recipients, 82.4% reported eating better; additionally, it was reported to increase the incomes of the poorer families by about 25%. == Other programs ==  Quatinga Velho  Quatinga Velho is a Brazilian village in the Quatinga district of the Mogi das Cruzes municipality, which is becoming well-known because of the basic income-project which is taking place there. The project started 2008 and is organized by the non-profit organization ReCivitas. The funding has so far been based entirely on private donations. In June 2011 83 people in the village got 30 Brazilian reals per person and month. The organization hopes that all people in the village will eventually get the basic income, and also that similar projects will get going in other villages in and outside Brazil. The organizers are currently building a social bank, so that the basic income in the future can be financed through investments rather than donations. The idea is that the bank will operate as an investment bank, but the profit will go to basic income instead of a dividend to shareholders and managers. One plan is to use some of the first revenue to support the basic income project in Otjivero, Namibia, and then to initiate similar projects in different parts of Brazil.BRAZIL: RECIVITAS expands its local BIG to 83 people as it charters the ‚ÄúBIG Social Bank\\" BI News 2011-06  Santo Ant√¥nio do Pinhal  In November 2009, the mayor of the Santo Ant√¥nio do Pinhal municipality passed into law a basic income program that would reserve 6% of its tax revenue to fund an unconditional dividend for all persons who have resided in the municipality for 5 years or more. , Santo Ant√¥nio do Pinhal was the only municipality in Brazil which had implemented a basic income program. Senator Eduardo Suplicy has praised the municipality for being a pioneer in implementing such a program at a municipal level in Brazil.  Apia√≠  In November 2013, the Apia√≠ municipality adopted a similar law to Santo Ant√¥nio do Pinhal's, with the difference that no portion of the municipality's tax revenue was directly allocated to the fund, due to a veto to that clause.Lei municipal n¬∫ 041 de 11 de Novembro de 2013 ‚Äî Institui a Renda B√°sica de Cidadania no Munic√≠pio de Apia√≠ == References  External links == * Article at cpj.ca * Growing support for Basic income, published at globalincome.org * A basic income-letter given to president Obama by Eduardo Suplicy 2011 * Bolsa Familia on WorldBank.org Brazil Category:Welfare in Brazil ","title":"Universal basic income in Brazil"},{"id":"35182647","text":"Jean T√©merson (1898‚Äì1956) was a French actor. ==Selected filmography== * The Lover of Madame Vidal (1936) - Guillaume - le domestique * With a Smile (1936) - Cam (uncredited) * P√©p√© le Moko (1937) - Grav√®re * Blanchette (1937) * Champs-Elysees (1937) - Firmin, le domestique * La chaste Suzanne (1937) - Alexis * Boulot aviateur (1937) * The Messenger (1937) - Le ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel (uncredited) * The Alibi (1937) - Jojo, l'ami de Dany * Le gagnant (1937) * Les deux combinards (1938) - Ernest - le larbin * Ramuntcho (1938) - Salaberry * Barnab√© (1938) - Firmin * Alert in the Mediterranean (1938) - Le docteur Laurent * La Piste du sud (1938) - Chailloux * √âducation de prince (1938) - Hector, le valet de chambre * Le r√©volt√© (1938) - Blotaque * Prince de mon coeur (1938) - Tsoupoff - le chambellan * The Chess Player (1938) - Stanislas, le roi de Pologne * Captain Benoit (1938) - Tripoff, le touriste * Quand le coeur chante (1938) * Rapha√´l le tatou√© (1939) - Monsieur Chromo * Les gangsters du ch√¢teau d'If (1939) - Papalouche * The Five Cents of Lavarede (1939) - Tartinovitch * Mon oncle et mon cur√© (1939) - Le chauffeur * Berlingot and Company (1939) - Donadieu - un homme aux id√©es bien arr√™t√©es * Monsieur Brotonneau (1939) - L'huissier * Sacred Woods (1939) - L'huissier * Personal Column (1939) - L'inspecteur Batol * Le Danube bleu (1940) - Alexander * President Haudecoeur (1940) - Capet * Monsieur Hector (1940) - Le Baron Grondin * Volpone (1941) - Voltore * Soyez les bienvenus (1942) * The Misfortunes of Sophie (1946) - Le policier Moucheron * Une femme coup√©e en morceaux (1946) * On ne meurt pas comme √ßa (1946) - Le commissaire * L'ennemi sans visage (1946) - Hector / Le valet / Hector - the butler * Rooster Heart (1946) - Stanislas Pugilaskoff * Cargaison clandestine (1947) * Si jeunesse savait...

Willem Bosman (12 January 1672 - after 1703) was a merchant in the service of the Dutch West India Company, spending most of his time in the Dutch Gold Coast. Bosman was born in Utrecht. Although he sailed to the Gold Coast as an apprentice when he was only 16 years of age, he managed to climb the ranks and eventually became head merchant (Dutch: opperkoopman). In 1702 he sailed back to the Dutch Republic, and little is known of his later life. Bosman is best known for his description of the Gold Coast titled Nauwkeurige beschrijving van de Guinese Goud- Tand- en Slavekust (An accurate description of the Guinean gold-tooth and Slave Coast) published in 1704. This document remained the most authoritative description of the area for more than a century and provided significant detail of the Komenda Wars in which Bosman took part. He described in detail the functioning of the slave trade and commented of Fida that \\"markets of men are here kept in the same manner as those of beasts are with us.\\" The book was a major source for Ghanaian historians in the twentieth century and was republished in English in 1967.

Localization in the kidney and renal pelvis has been the most frequent and better known occurrence followed by that in the gallbladder but many others have been subsequently recorded. The pathological findings of the process and etiopathogenetic and clinical observations have been reviewed by Cozzutto and Carbone. ==Location== The xanthogranulomatous type of inflammation is most-commonly seen in pyelonephritis and cholecystitis, although it has more recently been described in an array of other locations including bronchi, lung, endometrium, vagina, fallopian tubes, ovary, testis, epydidymis, stomach, colon, ileum, pancreas, bone, lymph nodes, bladder, adrenal gland, abdomen and muscle. Telling apart clinically a XP from a tumor condition can be challenging as pointed out by several authors. Cozzutto and Carbone suggested that a wide array of entities characterized by a large content of histiocytes and foamy macrophages could be traced back at least in part to a xanthogranulomatous inflammation. These include such varied disturbances as xanthoma disseminatum, ceroid granuloma of the gallbladder, Whipple's disease, inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung, plasma cell granuloma of the lung, malakoplakia, verruciform xanthoma, foamy histiocytosis of the spleen in thrombocytopenic purpura, isolated xanthoma of the small bowel, xanthofibroma of bone, and gastric xanthelasma. A pathogenetic model might be suggested as follows: #suppuration, hemorrhage and necrosis, #granulomatous tissue with granular histiocytes and foamy macrophages, #fibrohistiocytoma- like or plasma cell granuloma-like patterns, #possible myofibroblast metaplasia. A reactive fibrohistiocytic lesion simulating fibrous histiocytoma has been reported by Snover et al. Reactive granular cells in sites of trauma have been regarded of histiocytic nature. Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-Dorfman disease) might share several aspects of the XP. Likewise there might be some superimpositions between the XP and the plasma cell granuloma/histiocytoma-inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor complex. The XP might be an important stage of this complex. ==Histology== Under microscope, the cellular infiltrate includes neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, erythrocytes, hemosiderin-laden macrophages and prevalent foamy histiocytes.The latter are interspersed among other cells but often they cluster in a compacted mosaic-like pattern. The large lipid-laden macrophages display an eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm with a granular and vacuolated quality but can also have a spindle shape. Foreign body-type and Touton-type giant cells, calcospherites, cholesterol clefts and hemosiderin deposits are additional findings. Hemorrhage, suppuration and necrosis are therefore the initial conditions leading to the xanthogranulomatous response. Plasma cells and fibrosis increase in later stages with the former being numerous and prominent. Proteus and Escherichia coli are the most commonly involved bacteria in xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. The foam cells of monocyte/macrophage origin are positive for KP1, HAM56, CD11b and CD68 as pointed out by Nakashiro et al. in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis). Many T lymphocytes were identified by these authors positive to CD4 and CD8. Macrophages and T lymphocytes demonstrated a marked expression of HLA-DR antigen. A delayed type hypersensitivity reaction of cell mediated immunity has been suggested in the pathogenesis of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Destructive tumor-like masses with variable extension into adjacent fat and connective tissue can occur in cases involving organs such as kidney and gallbladder. ==See also== * Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis == References == Category:Inflammations Category:Gallbladder disorders ","title":"Xanthogranulomatous inflammation"},{"id":"35182706","text":"Free kick for Al-Ittihad (2004 & 2005 AFC winner) against Persepolis.

It was founded in 1975 and nowadays represents around 200,000 European veterinarians. The FVE strives to support veterinarians in delivering their professional responsibilities and representing the veterinary profession to the outside world. The FVE provides a platform for veterinarians across Europe to interact, to discuss and to develop position papers and professional guidelines. The current FVE motto is: \\"Veterinarians care for animals and people!\\" FVE publishes 4 times a year a newsletter which can be found on the FVE website. ==Structure== FVE is structured as follows: the representatives delegated by the national veterinary organisations meet twice a year, constituting the General Assembly. The General Assembly has the following powers: to define FVE policy, to approve the finances, to approve or exclude members or observers, to elect the new FVE Board and to control the activities of the Board. The FVE Board - consisting of a President, a Treasurer and three Vice Presidents - meets several times a year and defines the FVE position concerning veterinary issues (see ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù) and decides on long term programmes, i.e. strategies. Decisions taken by the Board are carried out by the FVE Secretariat, a permanent office which supervises the day-to-day activities of the FVE and reports to the Board. The Secretariat is located in Brussels, the heart of EU policy - and decision making, allowing the FVE to participate on an EU level and to react adequately and timely to relevant developments. Apart from its members the FVE hosts 4 specialised veterinary groups or Sections. Sections are European organisations representing vocational groups of the veterinary profession in Europe. They include: Practising Veterinarians (UEVP), Hygienists and Public Health Veterinarians (UEVH), Veterinarians working in Education, Veterinary Research and Industry (EVERI) and State Veterinary Officers (EASVO). ==Main areas of focus and tasks== The FVE considers that the main task of the veterinarian is to ‚Äúcare for animal health and welfare and veterinary public health‚Äù. In order to create the right conditions for the veterinarian to do so, the FVE formulated a number of priority subjects. FVE efforts are focused on: * One Health¬∞ * Animal Health * Animal Welfare * Education * Food Safety and Public Health * Medicines * Veterinary Profession One Health concept is a worldwide strategy for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment. FVE published in 2006 and 2011 its strategic plan. To make use of the best available knowledge the FVE can call upon veterinary experts to play a key role in FVE decision making. These experts take part in a Working Group which are appointed to deal with a particular subject and during a defined period. Once formulated a position on a specific subject, this position needs to be disseminated to the members and the outside world. The FVE achieves this by means of a newsletter for its members and position papers and press releases for all interested parties. These publications are not only to be seen as notifications, but also as tools to assist and influence the decision making process by EU policy makers. This can be deduced from the FVE statement that: ‚ÄúOne of the most important tasks for FVE is building up, improving and maintaining links and relationships with the key policy makers in the EU institutions in order to establish and maintain FVE's credibility as a serious player and to influence the decision making process in the EU.‚Äù == Positions == On June 6, 2015 the FVE adopted a position paper in which it recommends the prohibition of the use of wild animals in traveling circuses. ==References * Official website * www.onehealthinitiative.com * All five members Category:Organizations established in 1975 Category:Non-profit organizations based in Europe Category:Veterinary organizations ","title":"Federation of Veterinarians of Europe"},{"id":"35182709","text":"Loxostege fascialis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

The series is hosted by comedian Jeff Foxworthy, with gospel musician Kirk Franklin joining Foxworthy as co-host and announcer in the second season. The series debuted on August 23, 2012. Each season of the series is played as a nine-episode tournament with six episodes of opening rounds, two semi-finals, and a final. Each opening round starts with three teams of three contestants answering questions about the Bible. The teams then nominate their strongest contestants to answer questions by themselves without any assistance from their teammates. After this part of the round, the third-placed team is eliminated and the two highest-scoring teams compete in a final round with the scores being reset to zero. The remaining teams answer as many questions correctly as possible within one minute, and the highest-scoring team from this round wins a $20,000 prize which is given to the team's nominated charity. The winning team then advances to a semi- final game against two other winning teams; the winning team from this game advances to a final game where the grand prize is raised to $100,000. Thus, the team that wins the season-long tournament earns a total of $140,000 for their charity. The show became the highest-rated original program in the history of Game Show Network. In 2014, The American Bible Challenge received two nominations at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards: one for the series as Outstanding Game Show and the other for Foxworthy as Outstanding Game Show Host; they lost to Jeopardy! and Steve Harvey (host of Family Feud) respectively. ==Gameplay== Main game To begin the game, a category is revealed, and the three teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 10 points; an incorrect answer loses 10 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must wait until after the host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in. Each team then participates in a physical stunt that involves teams using common household items to answer questions about biblical figures. For example, in the game Stick a Fork In It, the teams must answer the question by using a spoon to catapult a fork into one of several glasses labeled with different possible answers. Where teams compete individually, each team is given 60 seconds, occasional games where teams compete at the same time are either untimed (with the first team to complete the game winning) or played in 90 seconds. In all cases, the team that wins the stunt receives 20 points, in case of a tie, each of the teams involved in the tie receives the points. The next round, entitled Kirk's Righteous Remix, features Grammy Award‚Äìwinner Kirk Franklin and a choir singing songs relating to various books of the Bible. Each team is then given one question based on an announced subject worth 30 points, no penalty is assessed for an incorrect answer. The teams then set their strongest respective contestants aside for the final round of main gameplay, entitled The Chosen Three. These contestants move to an area behind the teams, and cannot participate in this round. The host then asks each team, in turn, a question based on an announced category. Each question in this round is worth 50 points, with no penalty assessed for an incorrect answer. Only the two contestants standing at the podium may confer and answer the question. Two questions are asked to each team in this round. In the Chosen Three round, the contestants who were set aside from the previous round stand alone at their podiums, with their teammates standing in the area behind them. The host asks each contestant, in turn, a question with six possible answers, three of which are correct. The contestants then make three selections without conferring with the rest of their respective teams. Each individual correct answer is worth 100 points, thus, a total of 300 points are available to each team in this round. The two teams with the highest total scores advance to the final round, while the third-place team is eliminated and leaves with $2,500 for their charity. The Final Revelation Before the final round of regular gameplay, entitled The Final Revelation, both teams' scores from the main game are discarded. The host announces the category for the final round, and gives each team a copy of the Bible. The teams then move to a backstage area, and are permitted up to ten minutes to study the Bible for information based on that category. In season two, while backstage, the teams also have the option to use the YouVersion mobile app of the Bible on an electronic tablet along with their physical copy of the Bible. After the ten minutes, the first team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team questions from the announced category. Each question is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play the same set of questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all winnings from previous episodes. Previous rules Immediately following the first round in season two, each team had a chance to earn 25 additional points. Before the show, a question was asked to 100 YouVersion users (e.g. \\"Would you rather fast for 40 days or eat manna for 40 years?\\"). A question with three possible choices was then asked about the percentage of people who answered (e.g. \\"What percentage said they would rather fast for 40 days than eat manna for 40 years?\\"). During the break, each team wrote their answer on a tablet computer, and each team that submitted the correct answer earned 25 points. This round was removed from the game in the third season and replaced with another opening round- style game played for ¬± 10 points a question. Following the second round in season one, teams had to choose the apocryphal verse from three true Bible verses. Since scoring was disappointingly low, this round was eliminated in later shows. ==Production== Jeff Foxworthy hosted all three seasons of the series. Kirk Franklin joined the show during the second season. The series began development with production staff approaching Troy Schmidt, a pastor at First Baptist Church in Windermere, Florida, to work as both a writer and a consultant for the show. One of Schmidt's initial roles was to be an \\"on- camera Bible expert\\" for the series, one of many aspects of the pilot episode that a test audience rejected, and one with which Schmidt himself later admitted he was not comfortable. In response to the early criticism from the test audience, Game Show Network (GSN) took a six-week period to bring in several new staff members and make various changes to the show's format. After these changes were made, the test audience became more appreciative of the series, and GSN announced its development to the public at an upfront presentation in New York City on March 21, 2012, for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot; which was hosted by American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs. Season one The first season of The American Bible Challenge premiered its first of nine episodes on August 23, 2012. An audience of 1.730 million viewers watched the debut episode, making it GSN's highest-rated original program in its history. In total, when combined with a rerun of the episode later that evening, the show brought in over 2.3 million viewers (1.730 million at 8:00 pm; 571,000 at 11:00 pm) for the night. On October 18, 2012, Team Judson's Legacy, consisting of married couple Drake and Christina Levasheff of Irvine, California and their friend Dean Bobar, were crowned champions of the inaugural season's tournament, winning a total of $140,000 for Hunter's Hope, a leukodystrophy charity, chosen in honor of the Levasheffs' son, Judson, who had died in 2007 of late- onset Krabbe disease. By the end of the first season, the series had become GSN's most successful original program ever, garnering a total of over 13 million total viewers. Season two A second nine-episode season of the series was announced on October 9, 2012. GSN advertised that auditions would be held nationwide in November and December, and that the season would also feature the addition of Franklin to the series. The second season premiered on GSN March 21, 2013 debuting to 1.152 million viewers. On May 23, 2013, Team Wagner Warriors, consisting of brothers Joshua, Jesse, and Daniel Wagner from Owasso and Tulsa, Oklahoma, were crowned champions of the second season, winning a total of $140,000 for Wagner Ministries International, a missionary organisation founded by their father. A portion of the winnings was used for Wagner Ministries' involvement in the \\"One Nation One Day\\" evangelical event in Honduras in July 2013. Season three On August 8, 2013, GSN announced plans to renew The American Bible Challenge for a third season, with both Foxworthy and Franklin returning as hosts. The third season once again consisted of nine episodes, which began airing May 22, 2014. On July 17, 2014, Team Bible Belts, consisting of Jonathan King, Matt Phipps and Brad Harris from Otway, Ohio, were crowned as the third season's champions, winning a total $140,000 for Kicks for Jesus, a nonprofit which combines Bible study and taekwondo. While GSN never canceled the series, the third season remains the most recent season to air given the lack of production and series announcements since 2014. ==Reception== David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave The American Bible Challenge a positive review, saying, \\"Anyone who knows even a little about the Bible will be unable to resist playing along and matching answers with the teams on the screen.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was also pleased, calling the show \\"nothing if not magnanimous, sending even the losing teams home with a little something for their charities. A spirit of good will prevails.\\" Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical, calling the series \\"just as dull as it sounds,\\" and arguing that \\"weariness\\" could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of Patheos recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, \\"Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show.\\" Additionally, Bounce TV expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013, network chief operating officer Jonathan Katz commented, \\"We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of The American Bible Challenge and Catch 21 will add fuel to Bounce TV's skyrocketing growth.\\" The series was honored with two Emmy Award nominations at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards in 2014. The series received a nomination for Outstanding Game Show, while Foxworthy received one for Outstanding Game Show Host. Both the show and Foxworthy lost to Jeopardy! and Steve Harvey of Family Feud respectively. ==Merchandise== In an effort to promote the show's second season, Schmidt released a study book entitled The American Bible Challenge: A Daily Reader, Volume 1 in 2013. The book features nine weeks worth of study and questions previously seen on the show. Each day introduces a different lesson and passage of Christian scripture, with five questions being asked at the end of the day's lesson. An online Bible study was also launched on GSN's website at the start of the second season. In addition to the Bible studies, GSN released a mobile game based on the show for Facebook, iOS devices, and Android devices in 2012, while Talicor released a board game based on the series in 2014. ==References== Footnotes Bibliography * * ==External links== * at the Wayback Machine * * Category:2010s American game shows Category:2012 American television series debuts Category:2014 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:Game Show Network original programming Category:Games based on the Bible Category:Television series by Embassy Row Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television ","title":"The American Bible Challenge"},{"id":"35182864","text":"The 2012 AFC Cup knockout stage was contested by a total of 16 teams (10 from West Asia Zone and 6 from East Asia Zone). They included the 8 group winners and the 8 group runners-up from the group stage. Each round of this single- elimination tournament was played over one or two matches. In the round of 16, each tie was played as one match, hosted by the winners of each group against the runners-up of another group. In the quarter-finals and semi-finals, each tie was played over two legs on a home-and-away basis. The final was hosted by one of the finalists, decided by draw. The away goals rule (for two-legged ties), extra time (away goals do not apply in extra time) and penalty shootout would be used to decide the winner if necessary. The matchups for the round of 16 were decided based on the results from the group stage. After the completion of the round of 16, the draw for the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final was held at the AFC house in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 14 June 2012, 15:00 UTC+08:00. In this draw, the \\"country protection\\" rule was applied: if there are exactly two clubs from the same country, they may not face each other in the quarter-finals; however, if there are more than two clubs from the same country, they may face each other in the quarter-finals. ==Qualified teams== {  - !Group !width=175Winners !width=175Runners- up - !A  Al-Qadsia  Al-Suwaiq - !B  Arbil  Kazma - !C  Al-Ettifaq  Al-Kuwait - !D  Al-Wehdat  Neftchi Farg'ona - !E  Al-Shorta  Al-Zawra'a - !F  Kitchee  Terengganu - !G  Chonburi  Home United - !H  Kelantan  Arema } ==Bracket== While the bracket below shows the entire knockout stage, the draw for the round of 16 matches was determined at the time of the group draw.

Embodied cognition occurs when an organism's sensorimotor capacities (ability of the body to respond to its senses with movement), body and environment play an important role in thinking. The way in which a person's body and their surroundings interacts also allows for specific brain functions to develop and in the future to be able to act.Cowart, M. (2005, Jul. 8 ). Embodied Cognition. http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/ This means that not only does the mind influence the body's movements, but the body also influences the abilities of the mind, also termed the bi-directional hypothesis. There are three generalizations that are assumed to be true relating to embodied cognition. A person's motor system (that controls movement of the body) is activated when (1) they observe manipulable objects, (2) process action verbs, and (3) observe another individual's movements.Mahon, B. Z, and A. Caramazza. (2008). A critical look at the embodied cognition hypothesis and a new proposal. Journal of Physiology - Paris, 102 pp. 59‚Äì70. Embodied semantics is one of two theories concerning the location and processing of sensory motors inputs within the human brain. The theory of embodied semantics involves the existence of specialized hubs where the meaning of a word is tied with the sensory motor processing unit associated with the word meaning. For example, the concept of kicking would be represented in the sensory motor areas that control kicking actions.Rueschemeyer, S. et al. (2010). Effects of Intentional Motor Actions on Embodied Language Processing. Experimental Psychology, 57 (4), pp. 260‚àí66. As a result, the theory assumes that individuals must possess a body to understand English. == Neural Circuitry == The overlap between various semantic categories with sensory motor areas suggests that a common mechanism is used by neurons to process action, perception, and semantics. The correlation principle states that neurons that fire together, wire together. Also, neurons out of sync, delink. When an individual pronounces a word, the activation pattern for articulatory motor systems of the speaker leads to activation of auditory and somatosensory systems due to self-perceived sounds and movements. If a word meaning is grounded in the visual shapes of the objects, the word form circuit is active together with neural activity in the ventral-temporal visual stream related to processing of visual object information. Correlation learning links the word and object circuits, resulting in an embodied object-semantic relationship. ==Semantic Hubs== A semantic hub represents a focal point in the brain where all semantic information pertaining to a specific word is integrated. For example, the color, shape, size, smell, and sound associated with the word ‚Äúcat‚Äù would be integrated at the same semantic hub. Some candidate regions for semantic hubs include: # Inferior Frontal Cortex: the anterior part of Broca's area and adjacent tissue in the left Inferior Frontal Cortex including Brodmann's areas 44, 45, and 47 are activated for semantic processing and functional changes. # Superior Temporal Cortex: contains Wernicke's area which controls the classic posterior language area in and adjacent to the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus. This area is thought to be a semantic processor on the basis of lesion, perfusion, and imaging data. # Inferior Parietal Cortex: angular and adjacent to supramarginal gyrus in inferior parietal cortex is thought to be most strongly activated during semantic processing of cross-modal spatial and temporal configurations. # Inferior and middle temporal cortex: a general semantic binding site between words and their meaning in left or bilateral medial/inferior temporal cortex. # Anterior temporal cortex: thought to be involved in semantic dementia. which is a severe and specific semantic deficit characterized by lesions to both temporal poles. Semantic integration mechanisms involve various hub sites listed above, which contradicts the idea that there is one center where all integration occurs. However, each individual hub is compliant with the amodal model. Collectively, all of the hubs provide evidence for the theory that there are areas within the brain where emotional, sensory, and motor information all converge in one area. ==Semantic Category Specificity== Each potential semantic hub is activated to a specific degree according to the category that the perceived word belongs to. For example, lesions to each of the five potential hubs do not affect all words. Instead, experimental data determines that one semantic category suffers more than another as it pertains to the word. # Left Inferior Frontal Cortex and bilateral frontocentral motor systems: these two areas are strongly activated in response to action related words or phrases. Lesions to these two areas produces impairments in the processing of action related words and action related concepts. # Bilateral superior temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated in response to words related to sounds. Lesions to this area produce impairment in sound word processing. # Left Inferior Parietal Cortex: especially near the supramarginal gyrus, this area is activated by spatial language. Lesions to the Inferior Parietal Cortex produced impairment involving spatial language such as prepositions. # Medial/Inferior Temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated by category-specific words animals, tools, person's names, color, and form. Lesions show impairment in category- specific words for these categories as well. # Anterior Temporal Cortex: this area is associated with processing the differences between semantic categories. Some of the category differences are thought to be produced by the adjacent hubs. For example, category specificity is greatest close to the piriform and anterior insular olfactory cortex. Here, odor words such as ‚Äúcinnamon‚Äù lead to greater activation than control words. In the gustatory cortex in the anterior insula and frontal operculum, taste words such as ‚Äúsugar‚Äù lead to a stronger activation. ==Experiential Trace Hypothesis== Experiential Trace Hypothesis states that each time an individual interacts with the world, traces of that particular experience are left in our brain.Zwaan R.A. & Pecher, D. The grounding of cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. These traces can be accessed again when a person thinks of words or sentences that remind them of that experience. Additionally, these traces in our brain are linked to the action that they are related to. Words and sentences become those cues that retrieve these traces from our mind. Researchers have studied if the previous experience with a word, such as its location (up or down) in space, affects how people understand and then respond to that word.Lachmair, M. et al. (2011). Root versus roof: automatic activation of location information during word processing. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 18 pp. 1180‚Äì88. In one experiment, researchers hypothesized that if reading an object word also activates a location that is linked to that noun, then the following action response should be compatible with that association. They found that participants were faster to push a button higher than another button when the word was associated with being \\"up\\" or \\"above\\" than when the button was lower than the other for words associated with \\"up\\" and \\"above\\". The results of this study displayed that participants were faster to respond when the location of the word and the action they had to perform were similar. This demonstrates that language processing and action are connected. This research also found that the location information of a word is automatically activated after seeing the word. In a similar study, it was discovered that participants were equally as fast at responding to words that were associated with either an upward or downward location when the buttons to respond to these words were horizontal ‚Äì meaning that the experiential trace effect was ruled out when the responding action did not link to either of the locations that were activated.Zwann, R. A. (2002). Language Comprehenders Mentally Represent the Shape of Objects. Psychological Science, 13 (2), pp. 168‚Äì71 Experiential-Simulation Theory of Language Understanding Some theorists have proposed an experiential- simulation approach of language understanding. They argue that previous experiential traces related to a word may be reactivated at a later stage when accessing the meaning of the same word. This has been highlighted through the example of encountering the word ‚Äòairplane‚Äô in a situation where someone points to an airplane in the sky, thus making one look upwards. These experiential traces, e.g. ‚Äòlooking upwards‚Äô are later reactivated when accessing the meaning of the word ‚Äòairplane'. Similarly, another example might be when a person accesses the meaning of the word ‚Äòsnail‚Äô, they might also access experiential traces associated with this word, e.g. ‚Äòlooking downwards‚Äô (likely towards the ground).Zwaan, R. A., & Madden, C. J. (2005). Embodied sentence comprehension. Grounding cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking, 224-245. ==Language Comprehension and Motor Systems Involved in Action== Concrete verbs As a result of previous experience to certain words, several studies have found that the action associated with a certain word is also activated in the motor cortices when processing that same word. For example, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it was discovered that exposure to concrete action verbs referring to face, arm, or leg actions (e.g., to lick, pick, kick) activated motor regions that are stimulated when making actions with the foot, hand, or mouth.Hauk, O., Johnsrude, I., & Pulverm√ºller, F. (2004). Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex. Neuron, 41(2), 301-307. Abstract verbs However, findings are not as clear cut when abstract verbs are involved. Embodied theories of language comprehension assume that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system (Jirak et al., 2010).Jirak, D., Menz, M. M., Buccino, G., Borghi, A. M., & Binkofski, F. (2010). Grasping language‚ÄìA short story on embodiment. Consciousness and Cognition, 19(3), 711-720. Some studies have investigated the activation of motor cortices using abstract and also concrete verbs, examining the stimulation of the motor cortices when comprehending literal action verbs (concrete) vs. the metaphorical usage of the same action verbs (abstract). One such study used fMRI to study participants whilst they viewed actions performed by the mouth, hand or foot, and read literal and metaphorical sentences related to the mouth hand or foot. This study found activation in the premotor cortex for literal action (e.g. ‚Äúgrasping the scissors‚Äù) but not for metaphorical usage (e.g. ‚Äúgrasping the idea‚Äù).Aziz-Zadeh, L., Wilson, S. M., Rizzolatti, G., & Iacoboni, M. (2006). Congruent embodied representations for visually presented actions and linguistic phrases describing actions. Current Biology, 16(18), 1818-1823. These findings suggest that the assumption of embodied theories that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system may not be true. However, in contrast, other research has found motor cortex activation for the metaphorical usage of action verbs. One such study investigated cortical activation during comprehension of literal and idiomatic sentences using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). During a silent reading task, participants were presented with stimuli which included both literal and metaphorical arm-related action verbs, e.g. ‚ÄúMary caught the fish‚Äù versus ‚ÄúMary caught the sun‚Äù, and also literal and metaphorical leg-related action verbs, e.g. ‚ÄúPablo jumped on the armchair‚Äù versus ‚ÄúPablo jumped on the bandwagon‚Äù. This study found that processing of abstract verbs (idioms in this case) did indeed activate motor regions of the brain, activating anterior fronto-temporal activity very early compared to literal verbs.Boulenger, V., Shtyrov, Y., & Pulverm√ºller, F. (2012). When do you grasp the idea? MEG evidence for instantaneous idiom understanding. Neuroimage, 59(4), 3502-3513. Embodied Semantics Using fMRI for Concrete and Abstract Words Hauk and colleagues found that reading words associated with foot, hand, or mouth actions (examples: kick, pick, lick) activated by motor areas adjacent or overlapping with areas activated by making actions with the hand, foot, or mouth. Additionally, neurolinguist Tettmanti and colleagues found that listening to action related sentences activated the premotor cortex in a somatotopic fashion. Example: leg sentences showed premotor activity dorsal to hand sentences dorsal to mouth sentences. Aziz-Zadeh and colleagues localized foot, hand, and mouth premotor regions of interest in each subject by having subjects watch actions associated with each effector and read phrases associated with the foot, hand, and mouth. In each subject, regions most activated for watching a foot action were also most active for language related to foot actions. The same was true for the hand and mouth. Rizzolatti and colleagues have suggested that action plan (manipulating, reaching) is more important than the actual effector involved. Other studies have investigated activation of the motor system during comprehension of concrete and abstract sentences. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and a behavioural paradigm, one study investigated whether listening to action- related sentences activated activity within the motor cortices. This was investigated using Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from the TMS which were recorded from hand muscles when stimulating the hand motor area, and from foot and leg muscles when stimulating the foot motor area. Participants were presented with sentences relating to hand or foot actions. As control, participants listened to sentences containing abstract content. The study found there was indeed activation of the motor cortices whilst listening to sentences expressing foot/leg and hand/arm actions. This activation specifically concerned the areas of the motor system ‚Äòwhere the effector involved in the processed sentence is motorically represented‚Äô (pp. 360). Specifically, the results showed that listening to hand-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from hand muscles and listening to foot-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from foot muscle.Buccino, G., Riggio, L., Melli, G., Binkofski, F., Gallese, V., & Rizzolatti, G. (2005). Listening to action- related sentences modulates the activity of the motor system: a combined TMS and behavioral study. Cognitive Brain Research, 24(3), 355-363. == Embodied Semantics in BA44 == Aziz-Zadeh found that although both action observation and reading phrases about actions caused activity in premotor and prefrontal regions in the vicinity of Broca's area, the activated regions largely did not overlap. Activations for reading phrases were anterior and medial to activations for action observation. Aziz-Zadeh's research contradicts that of Hamzei who stressed the overlap of language and action observation activations in the inferior frontal gyrus. However, the difference in results most likely was due to the difference in language tasks. Hamzei used a verb generation task that caused widespread activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and the premotor cortex. The action observation task led to a small activation area within the larger activation area. Therefore, Hamzei noticed the overlap between areas. Aziz-Zadeh used a less extensive frontal activation task which allowed for areas activated by reading and by action observation to be clearly distinguished. ==Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)== See also: The Bi-Directional Hypothesis of Language and Action Sentence processing can facilitate activation of motor systems based on the actions referred to in the sentence. In one study, researchers asked participants to make judgments on whether a sentence was sensible or not. For example, \\"You handed Courtney the notebook\\" versus \\"Courtney handed you the notebook\\". They asked participants in one condition to push a button farther away from their body if the sentence was logical and a button close to their body when it wasn't logical. The results of this study demonstrated that participants were faster at pushing the \\"sentence is logical\\" button when the action in the sentence matched the action required by them to push the correct button.Havas, D. A. et al. (2007). Emotion simulation during language comprehension. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 14 (3), pp. 436‚àí41. This means if the sentence read \\"you handed Courtney the notebook\\", the participants were faster to push the button that was farther away from them when this button meant the sentence was logical. The depicted motion in these sentences affected the amount of time required to understand the sentences that described the motion that is in the same direction. This effect has been shown to apply to sentences that describe concrete actions (putting a book on a shelf) as well as more abstract actions (you told the story to the policeman).Glenberg, A. M, and M. Kaschak. (2002). Grounding Language in Action. Psychnomic Bulletin & Review, 9 (3), pp. 558‚Äì65. Other studies have tried to understand the ACE phenomenon by examining the modulation of motor resonance during language comprehension. In one study participants were asked to read sentences containing a frame of between one and three words. The participants had to rotate a knob, in one direction for half of the experiment and in the other direction for the other half. Each 5¬∞ of rotation induced the presentation of a new frame. Each of the sentences described actions involving manual rotation. In these, the rotation direction would or would not match the rotation direction implied by the sentence. Earlier studies, such as that by Glenberg & Kaschak (2002), examined motor resonance in responses to sentences presumably given after the sentence was read. In contrast, results of this study revealed that motor resonance had dissipated before the end of the sentence, with motor resonance occurring on the verb. This study made use of comprehension questions rather than sensibility sentences. The researchers have argued that this created a more naturalistic reading situation, so it could be argued that the results of this study are deemed more suitable because they are in regards to more naturalistic language. Overall, the researchers have concluded that motor resonance is quite immediate and short-lived and that duration of the effect is modified by linguistic context.Zwaan, R. A., & Taylor, L. J. (2006). Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 135(1), 1. Neurophysiological evidence has also been presented to prove an ACE. This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension, which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate their understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open hand-shapes), there were three different categories relating to hand- shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the hand-shape required to press the response-button was compatible with the hand-shape inferred by the sentence. ERP results provided evidence to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.Aravena, P., Hurtado, E., Riveros, R., Cardona, J. F., Manes, F., & Ib√°√±ez, A. (2010). Applauding with closed hands: neural signature of action-sentence compatibility effects. PLoS One, 5(7), e11751. The Action-Compatibility Effect also states that the brain resources used to plan and carry out actions are also used in language comprehension; therefore, if an action implied in a sentence is different from the suggested response, there is interference within these brain resources. ==Word Activation== Other studies have demonstrated that reading an object name interferes with how a person plans on grasping that object.Fischer, M., & Zwann, R. (2008). Embodied language: A review of the role of the motor system in language comprehension. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61(6), 825‚Äì50. It was also found that similar words can prime similar actions. Playing the piano and using a typewriter both utilize similar motor actions; these words prime each other in a word decision task. These studies have concluded that activation of motor decisions occur automatically when exposed to action-related words. == Metaphorical Language == Aziz-Zadeh investigated congruent somatotopic organization of semantic representations for metaphorical sentences in either hemisphere. Aziz-Zadeh presented subjects with stimuli such as ‚Äúkick the bucket‚Äù or ‚Äúbite the bullet‚Äù to read and then followed by presenting subjects with videos of hand, foot, and mouth actions. Evidence could not be found in either hemisphere to support this theory. The metaphors used in the experiment are common in the English language however. Therefore, the argument stands that if a metaphor is heard often enough it will not activate the same network of processing that it did initially. ==Actions emphasize meaning== Many studies have shown how body movements and speech can be combined to emphasize meaning (often called gesturing). A person can observe the actions of another to help them comprehend what that person is saying.Gibbs, R. W. (2006). Language and Communication. Embodiement and Cognitive Science, pp. 158‚Äì207. For example, if a person is pointing repeatedly, it helps the listener to understand that the direction being inferred is very important; whereas if it was a casual point in the general direction, the location of the object may not be as necessary to comprehend what the speaker is saying. Another example may be the stomping of one's foot. This can help the listener to understand the anger and frustration being conveyed by the speaker. ==Implications== Many studies have demonstrated that people's understanding of words and sentences can influence their movements and actions as well as the opposite ‚Äì peoples‚Äô actions can influence how quickly they can comprehend a word or sentence. This knowledge is important for many reasons. One study looked at the impact of embodied cognition in a classroom setting to facilitate and enhance language learning. For a child, there is a difference between oral language learning and reading. In oral language learning, the mapping between a symbol (word) and the object is common ‚Äì often brought about by gesturing to the object.Glenberg, A. M, and A. Goldberg. (2011). Improving early reading comprehension using embodied CAI. Instructional Science, 39 pp. 27‚Äì39. However, when a child is learning to read, they focus on the letter-sound combinations and the correct pronunciation of the words. Usually, the object the words are referring to, are not immediately connected with the word so an association between the word and object isn't immediately made. The researchers of this study suggest the Moved by Reading intervention which consists of two parts ‚Äì Physical Manipulation stage and an Imagined Manipulation stage. In physical manipulation, the child reads a sentence and then is instructed to act out that sentence with available toys. This forces the child to connect words with objects and their actions. In the imagined manipulation stage, the child reads the sentence and is then asked to imagine how they would interact with toys to act out the sentence. They studied this further and discovered that it is possible for these children to still benefit from the effects of embodied cognition when they manipulate objects on a computer screen. This embodied cognition software can help children facilitate language comprehension. Other implications for language instruction that would enhance acquisition and retention are to offer activities which invite learners to actively use their body in the process, or at least observe the teacher doing so, thus activating their mirror neurons. ==See also== *Embodied bilingual language ==References== Category:Cognition Category:Mind‚Äìbody problem ","title":"Embodied language processing"},{"id":"35182959","text":"Andrewesius is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Andrewesius amicus Kryzhanovskij, 1995 * Andrewesius arlettae Morvan, 1998 * Andrewesius boulbeni Morvan, 1998 * Andrewesius cavazzutii Morvan, 1998 * Andrewesius coeruleatus Fairasaire, 1891 * Andrewesius delavayi Morvan, 1997 * Andrewesius fedorovi Kryzhanovskij, 1994 * Andrewesius glasaour Morvan, 1998 * Andrewesius ollivieri Morvan, 1997 * Andrewesius omeishanicus Kryzhanovskij, 1994 * Andrewesius pratti Bates, 1891 * Andrewesius remondi Morvan, 1997 * Andrewesius rougemonti Morvan, 1997 * Andrewesius subsericatus Fairmaire, 1886 * Andrewesius sycophanta Fairmaire, 1886 * Andrewesius szetschuanus Jedlicka, 1932 * Andrewesius vikara Andrewes, 1923 * Andrewesius vimmeri Jedlicka, 1932 * Andrewesius vulpinus Andrewes, 1923 * Andrewesius yunnanus Csiki, 1931 * Andrewesius zezeae Csiki, 1931 ==References== Category:Platyninae Category:Taxa named by Herbert Edward Andrewes ","title":"Andrewesius"},{"id":"35182968","text":"Loxostege scutalis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

Erected in 1907 at the behest of the then independent City of Charlottenburg, it was meant as a counterpart to Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. ==Location== The Gates flank the western approach to the main thoroughfare Stra√üe des 17. Juni (former Charlottenburger Chaussee) through the Gro√üer Tiergarten park, which passes either sided of the Berlin Victory Column in the centre, on through Brandenburg Gate to the central Mitte district, where it continues as the Unter Den Linden boulevard. Porticoes and candelabra on Stra√üe des 17. Juni, view to the west They are close to the eastern border of the Charlottenburg locality, immediately to the west of the Tiergarten district. The Gate porticoes stand either side of the Strasse des 17. Juni to the east of the Charlottenburg Bridge, which spans the Landwehr Canal. To the west of the Bridge are two lavish street lights known as Candelabra (German: Kandelaber). ==History== Southern custom house, about 1900 A first wooden bridge on the road from Berlin to Charlottenburg was erected in the course of the building of the Landwehr Canal according to plans designed by Peter Joseph Lenn√© from 1845 to 1850. It was not one of the original gates from the Berlin Customs Wall that existed between 1737 and 1860, and the earlier Berlin Fortress that existed between 1650‚Äì1740. To collect tolls and octrois, the Prussian treasury had two symmetric custom houses built on each side of the road in 1856, designed by Friedrich August St√ºler in a Neoclassical style with Doric porticoes and sandstone columns. After the road tolls had been abolished in the late 19th century, the houses were rented, but began to block the increasing road traffic. In 1900, the bridge was purchased by the affluent City of Charlottenburg in order to rebuild it as a prestigious eastern entrance. The city council initiated an architectural design competition, though with no satisfactory result. The winner, Friedrich P√ºtzer from Darmstadt, designed a stately gate house, which has never been built. The present-day gate complex was finally erected according to plans designed by Charlottenburg's building authority itself together with the commissioned architect Bernhard Schaede, for a price of 1,572,000 German gold marks. Charlottenburg Gate shortly after completion Construction of the new bridge across the Landwehr Canal with a width of started in 1904. After the demolition of the custom houses, the tuff porticoes and the candelabra were erected in 1907. The two inner pylons left a gap for the traffic, flanked with larger-than-life bronze statues of King Frederick I of Prussia, the founder of Charlottenburg, and his consort Sophia Charlotte of Hanover. Canadian soldiers at war-damaged southern pylon, July 1945 In the course of the Nazi Welthauptstadt Germania plans, Adolf Hitler's chief architect Albert Speer in 1937 ordered the Charlottenburger Chaussee road widened to a \\"East-West-Axis\\". To enable a continuous view on street level, the bridge was flattened and broadened, while the candelabra and the porticoes were dismantled and moved further apart to a distance of . Charlottenburg Gate and its surrounds were heavily damaged during World War II and the final Battle of Berlin, when in April 1945 forces of the Polish 1st Infantry Division, pushing eastwards to the Berlin city centre, fought against retiring Wehrmacht troops. ==Restoration== By 1970, Charlottenburg Gate and its surrounds had been restored in their 1930s position, except for the candelabra in front, which were razed to their foundations shortly after the war. A second complete renovation was begun in 2004, co-financed by a private cultural heritage foundation and a disputed giant advertisement poster. Finally, the two candelabra were rebuilt in 2009. Charlottenburg Gate with candelabra, 2010 condition The public debate continues, whether it is adequate to restore the gate ensemble in its original Wilhelmine condition while the general impression remains affected by the 1930s relocation with respect to modern traffic.

An isochrone is defined as \\"a line drawn on a map connecting points at which something occurs or arrives at the same time\\". Such a map is sometimes termed simply an isochrone (iso = equal, chrone = time). In hydrology and transportation planning isochrone maps are commonly used to depict areas of equal travel time. The term is also used in cardiology as a tool to visually detect abnormalities using body surface distribution. ==History== Francis Galton's first known isochronic map published for the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, 1881. It shows the travel times in 1881 from London, United Kingdom to different parts of the world in days. It assumes that there are favourable travel conditions and that travel arrangements over land have been made in advance. It assumes travelling methods of the day within a reasonable cost. An early isochrone map of Melbourne rail transport travel times, 1910-1922 Isochrone maps have been used in transportation planning since 1887 or earlier. Early examples of Isochrone maps include the Galton¬¥s Isochronic Postal Charts and Isochronic Passage Charts of 1881 and 1882, Bartholomew's Isochronic Distance Map and Chart first published 1889 or earlier and Albrecht Penck's Isochronenkarte first published 1887. Where as Galton and the Bartholomews published maps depicting the days or weeks it took to travel long distances, Albrecht further developed the idea to not only depict long distances and world travel but also smaller areas. Penck also created a series of maps that only depict the travel times of a certain transportation mode, for example Rail transport. Isochrone maps are commonly used in the UK in connection with development control. Information technology in the has enabled them to be dynamically generated for use in websites, being used by house hunters wishing to evaluate residential areas. ==Usage== Hydrology Isochrone and related maps are used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall. An early example of this method was demonstrated by Clark in 1945. Transport planning Isochrone maps in the context of transport planning are essentially maps of accessibility where travel time is used as the cost metric. Isochrone maps can be created for different modes of transportation, e.g. foot, bicycle, motor vehicle. Put simply, the output of an isochrone map for transport will show how far (in distance) is reachable from a start point, including the parameter of time. An example of the output can be found using this interactive Mapbox example, where you can see how far can be traveled in a specific amount of time. Such maps for private motor transport were widely used in a 1972 study into airport accessibility in Hampshire, South East England. At that time, their use was disadvantaged by being time consuming to create. The term isodapane map is used to refer to a map were the contour represent transportation cost instead of transportation time. Isochrone maps can be generated using the Google Maps API or TravelTime API and this can be done from arbitrary starting points. The creation of journey time isochrones to airports in Finland has been explained using the GIS software QGIS and pgRouting (an extension of PostGIS). Isochrones for transit travel times can be computed using the routing engine OpenTripPlanner.Isochrone map of Toronto comparing travel times between bicycle and public transit (2016) General public Journey time websites have been built using mapping technologies and open data. Examples of such sites are PedCatch, instaGIS, TravelTime platform by iGeolise, Mapumental and Mapnificent. Such sites can be used by house hunters wishing to evaluate residential areas. An isochrone map of the London Underground network was made available in 2007. Iso4App is an isochrone map service (car, bike and pedestrian) available on Europe, Russian Federation, Ukraine, China, North America, Latin America, Australia-Oceania, South Africa; in addition iso4app implements isochrones on public transport. Demo is available at Tolosa (France). A time-based travel map that went viral was the Isochronic World Map, produced using data from Rome2rio's routing engine for plane, train, bus, ferry and automobile. It compared travel times from London in 2016 versus 1914. ==See also== *Accessibility (transport) *Public transport timetable *Transit map ==References Category:Urban planning Category:Hydrology models Category:Cardiology Category:Map types Free web app : isochrone calculator www.owlapps.net/application-geomarketing ","title":"Isochrone map"},{"id":"35183000","text":"Reza Negarestani (born 1977) is an Iranian philosopher and writer, known for \\"pioneering the genre of 'theory-fiction' with his book\\" Cyclonopedia which was published in 2008. it was listed in Artforum as one of the best books of 2009.

On March 11, 2011, faculty from Brooklyn College and The New School organized a symposium to discuss Cyclonopedia titled Leper Creativity. Later on in the year, Punctum books published a book with the same title that included essays, articles, artworks, and documents from or related to the symposium. In 2011, he co-edited Collapse's issue VII with Robin Mackay titled Culinary Materialism In 2012, Negarestani collaborated with Florian Hecker on an artwork titled \\"Chimerization\\" that was included in the dOCUMENTA (13) exhibition.http://d13.documenta.de/#/programs/the-kassel-programs/some- artworks-and-programs-initiated-by-documenta-13-participants/chimerizations- and-speculative-solutions/ He has since written librettos for a series of full-length albums based on Hecker's concept of 'chimerization'. After being associated with the philosophical movement of speculative realism for several years, Negarestani is currently lecturing and writing about rationalist universalism beginning with the evolution of the modern system of knowledge and advancing toward contemporary philosophies of rationalism, their procedures as well as their demands for special forms of human conduct. After going through different philosophical phases starting with Nick Land and subsequently Speculative Realism,https://www.re-press.org/book- files/OA_Version_Speculative_Turn_9780980668346.pdf The Speculative Turn: Continental Materialism and Realism, Re-press, 2011. Negarestani turned to rationalist inhumanism, according to which the concept of the human is under- explored and is a matter of theoretical and practical investigation, the results of which will lead to a thoroughgoing new conception of the human that stands in opposition to classical versions of humanism and human essentialism.https://www.e-flux.com/journal/53/59893/the-labor-of-the-inhuman- part-ii-the-inhuman/ Research paradigms such as Artificial General Intelligence and Neuroscience, according to Negarestani, provide us with insights as how the concept of the human is underdeveloped and must be understood as a subject of critical construction. In line with this line of inquiry, Negarestani's current philosophical project deals with what he calls a philosophy of intelligence as in contrast to the philosophy of mind. For Negarestani, the philosophy of intelligence goes beyond the philosophy of mind insofar as the concept of intelligence is beholden to a system of socially constituted thoughts and practices through which the intelligible is recognized.https://www.neroeditions.com/docs/reza-negarestani-engineering-the- world-crafting-the-mind/https://plijournal.com/volumes/30-restoration-and- resistance/ However, for Negarestani the term intelligence remains a philosophically vague concept, an explicatum. With a nod to Rudolf Carnap's project of explication, Negarestani instead proposes a conceptual engineering whereby the concept of intelligence is progressively replaced by its explicata, or refined concepts which methodically address different issues with regard to the question of 'What is Intelligence'.https://www.urbanomic.com/document/reengineering-philosophy/ For Negarestani, such issues span ontological, epistemological, methodological, technical and axiological concerns. Negarestani's emphasis on the necessary link between what we mean by intelligence and what it takes to render the world intelligible borrows elements from transcendental philosophy, German Idealism and systematic skepticism.

He achieved All Australian selection in the 2017 season. ==2018: Trade to Essendon== Following a salary cap issue at the GWS Giants, Shiel was encouraged to explore his options elsewhere and with the intention to continue his football in Victoria in the coming years, he decided to entertain the idea. He met with four clubs: St Kilda, Hawthorn, Carlton and Essendon and decided with the latter, Carlton explored extreme methods in trying to lure Dylan, flying the midfield star to Noosa on a private jet as part of a bold pitch to snare his signature.

His father owned an estate. He attended high school in Krotoschin and in 1875 studied at University of Wroclaw astronomy and mathematics under Heinrich Schr√∂ter and Jacob Rosanes. He then went to the Berlin University, where he studied under Karl Weierstrass, Ernst Eduard Kummer, Leopold Kronecker and Gustav Kirchhoff and received his doctorate in 1879 from Kummer: Geometrische Untersuchungen √ºber Strahlenkomplexe ersten und zweiten Grades. In 1880, he passed the exam and the same year qualified as a teacher at the University of Leipzig. After that, he was an assistant professor and in 1884 became an assistant to Felix Klein in Leipzig. In 1885 he was an associate professor there in 1888 and professor at the University of Tartu. In 1892, he was a professor of descriptive geometry at the RWTH Aachen University and in 1897 was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe, where he was also rector in 1904/1905. In 1909, he became a professor at the University of Strasbourg. After the loss of World War I, he was sacked by the French in 1919 and became a professor in Breslau, where he retired in 1924. Friedrich Schur studied differential geometry, transformation groups (Lie groups) after Sophus Lie. Many of his results, which he summarized in his book Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundation of Geometry) of 1909, can also be found in the work of David Hilbert without reference to Schur. He also wrote a textbook of analytical geometry (1898) and the graphical statics (1915). In 1912, he received the Lobachevsky Prize for his book Grundlagen der Geometrie, a Russian prize. In 1910, he was chairman of the German Mathematical Society. He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Karlsruhe. In 1927, he was selected as a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Among his students was Theodor Molien and Julius Wellstein. == Writings (selection) == *Schur: Grundlagen der Geometrie.

today.. ==Biography== Racim was born in Algiers, Algeria in 1896 into a distinguished family of artists of Turkish descent. whose pre-colonial prosperity had been undermined by the French regime's confiscation of property.. In 1880, Racim's father had re-established a wood-carving and copper-working workshop in the Casbah of Algiers, where his brother, Omar Racim, engraved decorated tombstones. The Racim family won commissions for decorating public buildings and the pavilions of French colonial exhibitions.. His talent for drawing was recognised during his primary education when he was given work copying Islamic decorative motifs for the state workshops set up by the Governor Charles Jonnart. By about 1914, Racim discovered the works of the Persian, Mughal and Andalusian miniatures made for the private use of the Muslim nobility. He evolved a personal hybrid form of expression through the miniature whereby he would use traditional materials and classical arabesque and calligraphic styles, yet use them to frame figurative inserts that had some modern features. As a teenager Racim befriended Nasreddine Dinet, who advised him on painting the figure and helped him obtain commissions to decorate books with calligraphic plates. Racim's main patrons were businessmen and government officials who valued his re-creation of the milieu of old Algeris. By the late 1930s he became a major figure in Algerian culture. As with most of his work, Racim's \\"Women at the Cascade\\" set out an imagined past, before the arrival of the French colonizers, when the indigenous were masters of the Maghreb.. The people of Algeria, prior to the French arrival, appear in his works as prosperous, given to fine textiles and costumes, and the arts of music, architecture and gardening. In fact, Roger Benjamin has argued that Racim's work could be said to wish away the presence of the foreign French settlors in his country. He celebrates a pristine Turkish city, not the industrialized port that had resulted for a century of French modernization. Nonetheless, he was not an ideologue, and recognized that his work had been enabled by the French scholarly..

On September 10, 1982, Esua was appointed bishop of Kumbo. Esua received his episcopal consecration on the following December 8 from archbishop Donato Squicciarini, the then apostolic nuncio to Cameroon, with the then recently appointed archbishop of Bamenda, Paul Mbiybe Verdzekov, and the bishop of Bu√©a, Pius Suh Awa, serving as co-consecrators. Esua was named coadjutor archbishop of Bamenda by Pope John Paul II on December 7, 2004; he succeeded Paul Mbiybe Verdzekov as archbishop of Bamenda on January 23, 2006. ==Views== Esua expressed his full intentions as Chief Pastor to advocate doctrinal views on issues like the Nkuv Affair. Quite a good number of the prominent members of the World Apostolate of Fatima (The Blue Army) became ringleaders of the unorthodox Nkuv devotion, since the latter was in some manner associated with the Fatima apparitions. It was on account of this association that the 13th of every month, and most especially the 13th of May, was taken as the official day of prayer for the Nkuvites. Since 7 October 1997, when Esua, then Bishop of Kumbo issued a pastoral Letter declaring the unorthodoxy of the Nkuv Affair and outlining the criteria for determining the authenticity of Marian apparitions, some of its adherents have withdrawn and regained full communion, some adhere both to Nkuv and to the church, and some have publicly excluded themselves from the church and pledged allegiance to Nkuv. Esua and the other bishops of the Bamenda Ecclesiastical Province (BAPEC), issued a letter to all Christians concerning the sacrament of marriage and HIV/AIDS. All the bishops requested that before the publication of marriage banns, couples must present to the parish priest a valid and authentic medical certificate showing that they have done HIV/AIDS screening. ==See also== *List of Roman Catholic dioceses in Cameroon ==References *Catholic-Hierarchy *Bigard Memorial Seminary, Enugu (in Nigerian) *L'Effort Camerounais, Newspaper of the National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon *Catholic Church in Republic of Cameroon (Cameroon) *Catholic Church in Cameroon *All Bishops of Cameroon Category:Cameroonian Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Pontifical Biblical Institute alumni Category:People from Bamenda ","title":"Cornelius Fontem Esua"},{"id":"35183100","text":"Javed Naseer Rind, also transliterated as Javed Nasir Rind, Javid Naseer Rind or Jawaid Naseer Rind, (died 5 November 2011) was abducted 10 September 2011 and his corpse was discovered 5 November 2011 in Balochistan, Pakistan.

A London-based source said that Rind had been fired and lost his position within the movement when he had been in communication with him while reporting on the UK trial of Hyrbyair Marri and Faiz Baluch on charges of terrorism. == Death == According to his nephew who was an eyewitness, Javed Naseer Rind was abducted by gunpoint and forcibly disappeared along with Rind's relative Abdul Samad Baloch near his home in Hub City, Lasbela District, Balochistan, Pakistan on 10 September 2011. After his disappearance, Balochistan Union of Journalists requested government intervention. His corpse was found 5 November 2011 near Ghazgi Chowk, Khuzdar, and his corpse had multiple bullet wounds, showed evidence of torture, and was found with a slip of paper identifying him as the journalist who had been previously kidnapped. His corpse was then transported to the civil hospital in Khuzdar for an autopsy. == Context == Balochistan is a resource rich region of Pakistan with an active separatist movement that has caused conflict between Pakistan and the terrorist within the region. The Balochistan conflict has created an unstable environment for journalists as they receive pressure from the nationalist groups about the coverage given to the other side. Journalists are often the target of death threats. By 2012, between 28 and 33 journalists were killed in Balochistan. Rind is among the 22 journalists between 2008 and 2012 who have become casualties of the Balochistan conflict. In 2010, Balochistan was considered the most dangerous place for journalists with six out of ninety seven deaths worldwide. In 2011, Rind's death pushed the count to over ten deaths. Nationwide, he was one of 12 Pakistani journalists killed in 2011 and one of around 23 Pakistani journalists killed from the beginning of 2010 to the end of 2011. Regionwide, he was one of 19 killed in 2011 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, according to the South Asian Free Media Association. == Impact == Following Rind's death the Balochistan Union of Journalists has requested a high level committee be put together by the government to investigate his death as well as the death of numerous colleagues. The perpetrator of the kill-and-dump method are Baloch terrorist groups like Baloch Liberation Army, Baloch Republican Army etc. Baloch terrorist groups have repeatedly threatened and attacked journalist in the province. Majority of the journalist who have been killed in the province, were killed by Baloch terrorist groups. == Reactions == In Pakistan, the Baluchistan Union of Journalists issued a condemnation after his abduction. A spokesperson for Committee to Protect Journalists joined with the Balochistan Union of Journalists and called for Rind's journalism to be investigated as motive for the abduction. Reporters Without Borders and International Federation of Journalists have also spoken out against Rind's death. A spokesperson for IFJ said, \\"Authorities must act swiftly to end this cycle of violence and impunity in what is statistically one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist.\\" The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists is educating journalists about how to react when they receive threats and the support they can get as a result. == See also == * List of journalists killed during the Balochistan conflict (1947‚Äìpresent) == References  External links == Category:Year of birth missing Category:2011 deaths Category:Baloch journalists Category:People from Balochistan, Pakistan Category:Assassinated Baloch journalists Category:People murdered in Balochistan, Pakistan Category:Deaths by firearm in Balochistan ","title":"Javed Naseer Rind"},{"id":"35183107","text":"Bandar bin Khalid (born 1965) is a Saudi businessman and a member of House of Saud.

Listed at , 140 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 294pp. Language: English. The All- American Girls Professional Baseball League, created by Chicago Cubs‚Äô owner Philip K. Wrigley in anticipation of losing male players to the World War II draft, gave a new name to the baseball game. Since its 1943 season opener, the circuit developed a select group of women that changed the ballgame forever between the 1940s and 1950s. Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Marilyn Jenkins played for her hometown team Grand Rapids Chicks during the last three seasons of the league. In addition, she enjoyed one of the most pleasant experiences lived by any player in the league's history. Jenkins was a modest but dedicated ballplayer who earned the responsibility of learning the game correctly at a very early age. She started a long time relationship of ten years with the Chicks when she was 10 years old, and stayed with them until the league folded after the 1954 season.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295 pp. Language: English. Marilyn was in grade school when she sneaked out of class to serve as a bat girl for her home team. When she was 13, the team allowed her to practice with them on the field. She always used to arrive very early to the ballpark and quickly learned to catch a ball during batting practice. When her father died in 1947 the Chicks provided a strong support for her and her mother. Then, when the team won the champion title in that season she felt comforted and happy again. Four years later, she turned 17 and was ready to start playing with the team. I learned a lot and idolized them, of course, she explained in an interview.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball ‚Äì Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2006. Format: Softcover, 438pp. Language: English. The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Jenkins opened 1952 with the Chicks, serving as a third-string catcher behind Lavonne Paire and Mamie Redman. She hit a .133 batting average in just 18 games. In her second year, she shared duties with Redman after Paire's departure to the Racine Belles. ◊¥Jenks◊¥ improved her average up to .207 in 69 games, while committing only eight errors in 292 fielding chances for a .972 mark.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book In the 1954 season the league adopted new rules of play, making the game much like Major League Baseball. The ball was reduced from 10 inches to 9 inches, while the pitching distance increased from 56 to 60 feet. In her first at-bat of the season, Jenkins smashed the new ball over the fence for the only home run of her career, which was cut short about halfway through the season due to health issues. A .192 career hitter, Jenkins also played in seven postseason games and was a member of the 1953 champion team, to achieve her childhood dreams of playing baseball for her hometown Chicks. A sure handed catcher, she received in 113 games and posted a fielding average of .960 (17 errors in 426 chances). She earned an additional distinction for being the only Grand Rapids native playing on the team. After baseball, Jenkins fulfilled a wide variety of jobs. She entered the healthcare field as a radiologic technologist, and years later offered paralegal services until 1980, then started an estate sales business that she attended for the next two decades. In her spare time she became an avid golfer. Since 1988 she is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The ceremony received even more attention when the Penny Marshall's film A League of Their Own, starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell, was released in 1992. To be cast in the film, actresses could not just look the part; they had to have the baseball skills too, according to Marshall.IMDb.com ‚Äì A League of Their Own (1992)Oprah.com video ‚Äì Casting for A League of Their Own. A tribute to Penny Marshall In 2010, Jenkins was among other 50 AAGPBL former players honored at Comerica Park before a Detroit Tigers' game against the Chicago White Sox. Jenkins and her AAGPBL pals also had a lunch cruise aboard the Detroit Princess Riverboat, in addition to a banquet and players meeting. It was a heck of a lot of fun, she said. At the time, none of us really thought we were doing something out of the ordinary. We just loved to play baseball.

He was originally recruited by incoming AFL club with one of their Northern Territory zone selections in 2010. He was traded to Adelaide at the end of 2015, after 51 matches in four AFL seasons for Greater Western Sydney. Hampton is originally from Alice Springs, and is the son of former politician Karl Hampton. ==AFL career== Greater Western Sydney (2012-2015) Hampton was one of the first players to be recruited by the Giants, using one of their Northern Territory zone selections in 2010. He had captained the Australian Institute of Sport academy team and was likened to former star Andrew McLeod. In February 2011, Hampton had the distinction of kicking Greater Western Sydney's first ever goal, in a match against an AFL Sydney under 21s side. Hampton made his AFL debut in Greater Western Sydney's first AFL game, in round 1 of 2012 against at ANZ Stadium, and went on to play 17 matches in his first year, playing both in attack and in defence. Hampton established himself in 2013 as a running defender, a position he had never played prior to AFL level, playing 18 matches and considerably improving on his 2012 output. Hampton started well in 2014, starring at half-back for the first seven rounds before injuries derailed the latter part of his season, including a shoulder injury that would keep him out for six weeks. He then played just five games in 2015, dominating in the NEAFL but failing to make an impact when called up to the AFL side. At the end of the season, Hampton decided to explore trade options and was ultimately traded to the Adelaide Football Club in exchange for a 2016 second-round draft pick. Adelaide (2016-2018) Hampton's new start at the Crows was delayed by a foot injury that ultimately sidelined him for the entire season.

He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, and entered the University of Edinburgh. While pursuing medical studies he made the acquaintance, of Sir William Allan and Scottish artists. A private income allowed him to go to Italy for three years. On the death of Henry Fuseli, he was, in 1825, elected to fill his place as a member of the Academy of St. Luke. He settled as an artist in Liverpool. Philips, who also practised etching, died unmarried at his residence, Rodney Street, Liverpool, on 1 August 1831. ==Works== Philips exhibited landscapes at the Liverpool Academy and the Royal Manchester Institution. The work by which he is best remembered is a series of twenty- eight engravings on copper, many of them from his own drawings, of old halls in Lancashire and Cheshire. These were originally issued in 1822‚Äì4 (possibly only 25 then printed). All were reissued in book form in 1893, letterpress by twenty-four local contributors, and a memoir of the artist.

Like his father, Joseph Brown engaged in business, and in manufacturing, and acquired sufficient wealth to permit him to follow his natural taste for science. He was greatly interested in the science of electricity, and his knowledge of that subject was remarkable for the time. He left an electric machine of his own construction, an outstanding example of this sort of apparatus for that time. He devoted considerable study to mechanics and was proficient in astronomy. His attention having been directed to the arrangements in course of preparation for the proper observation of the transit of Venus in 1769, he sent to England for suitable instruments, and subsequently an account of the observations made in Providence was published by Benjamin West, later professor of natural philosophy at College of Rhode Island (now Brown University). Brown was a warm friend of the College of Rhode Island, and was one of its trustees from 1769 until 1785. In 1770 he received the honorary degree of A.M. from the College, and from 1784 until his death held the chair of natural philosophy, giving his services to the institution without compensation. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781. As an architect, Joseph designed and helped to design a number of residential, educational, religious, and commercial buildings. His desk and bookcase is currently in the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence, Rhode Island. The desk and bookcase is made in the Chippendale style. The primary, outer wood is mahogany, but cherry and pine are used for its interior. Joseph Brown was a member of the First Baptist Church in America. He died December 3, 1785 in Providence. == Family == His brothers, all merchants of Rhode Island, were: Nicholas Brown, Sr., John Brown (a co- founder of the College of Rhode Island), and Moses Brown (also a co-founder of the College of Rhode Island).

Being the morganatic wife of the King, she was never a queen. == Life == Henri√´tte d'Oultremont was one of five children of Count Ferdinand d'Oultremont de W√©gimont from Li√®ge and his wife Johanna Susanna Hartsinck, daughter of Admiral Andries Hartsinck (1720-1788) and Johanna Cornelia de Bas (1721-1787). She was related to Count Charles Jean \\"John\\" d'Oultremont (1848-1917). Around 1840, King William found himself in discord with much of the Dutch population due to his refusal to implement demanded reforms. This discord was enhanced when the king, head of the strictly Protestant and royal House of Orange- Nassau, announced his intention to marry the Catholic Countess Henri√´tte, who had been a lady-in-waiting to his first wife, the late Queen Wilhelmine (1774-1837). The resistance was so great--Henri√´tte was Catholic and a native of Belgium, which had seceded from the Netherlands--that William decided to abdicate in favour of his son William II on 7 October 1840. After abdication, he styled himself King William Frederick , Count of Nassau. He married Henri√´tte on 17 February 1841; he was 71 years old at the time, she was 47, and the couple would have no children. She had received the Dutch title, Countess of Nassau on 7 February 1841, by which she was known during the couple's subsequent retirement in Berlin. William I died two years later, in 1843. Because of her devoted care for her elderly husband, the Dutch royal family awarded her an allowance and a castle near Aachen, where she died in 1864. Henri√´tte was not buried below the New Church in Delft with the Dutch kings and their queens; she was instead buried in the family vault in the chapel in the park surrounding W√©gimont castle in Soumagne, near Li√®ge in Belgium.

He most recently played for the Rochester Americans in the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played with the Pittsburgh Penguins, with whom he earned two Stanley Cup championships, and briefly with the Detroit Red Wings. Wilson was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft with the 28th pick (209th overall) of the seventh round. Wilson completed his junior season for the UMass Lowell River Hawks in 2014. ==Playing career== Junior Scott Wilson started his junior career on the Georgetown Raiders with a short 7-game stint for the 2008‚Äì09 season, scoring one point in the process. The next year Wilson played in every game (56) for the Raiders, finishing the season with 67 points, good enough for third best on the team. Georgetown continued its recent winning ways in 2009‚Äì10 season, going 41‚Äì10‚Äì5 and marched into the playoffs with Scott Wilson among the leaders. After dropping the Villanova Knights 4‚Äì2 in the first round, Georgetown fell to the #2-seed Oakville Blades 4‚Äì1. In the 11 playoff games Scott Wilson finished second on the Raiders with 17 points (9 goals, 8 assists). Wilson returned to Georgetown for 2010‚Äì11 and put up very similar numbers to his first year, scoring 61 points in 42 games (14 fewer games than the year before). The Raiders slid in the standings, ending up with a 32‚Äì15‚Äì2‚Äì1 record and though it was good enough for them to earn a bye past the qualifier, they entered the round of 16 facing off against the #3-seed Oakville Blades. in a reprise from the previous season, Oakville won the series 4‚Äì1. In four games Wilson managed 3 points, a far cry from his previous season. Despite the playoff disappointment, Wilson was able to not only earn a spot on U. Mass-Lowell's roster starting the upcoming fall, but he was also taken by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. College From the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, it was apparent that Lowell would have a resurgence from their abysmal 5-win season the year before when they matched the win total by mid- November. It wasn't until two separate 5-game win streaks that the River Hawks showed how improved they were with new players and under 1st-year coach Norm Bazin. Lowell entered the Hockey East tournament as the #2-seed with a 22‚Äì10‚Äì1 record, facing the Providence Friars in a best-of-three opening round. Wilson posted a goal and an assist in the first game, but the River Hawks' defence failed them in a 5‚Äì3 loss. Lowell won the second game 3‚Äì2 in overtime, but couldn't manage any offence in a 1‚Äì0 loss as they meekly bowed out of the tournament. Lowell's 23 wins, however, were enough to give them an at-large bid into the 2012 NCAA tournament for the first time in 16 years. the River Hawks were matched up against Miami (Ohio) and dropped the RedHawks 4‚Äì3 in overtime. Their tournament was short-lived, however, as they couldn't hold off the #1-seed (3rd overall) Union Dutchmen, losing 4‚Äì2. Despite the loss, it was one of Lowells most successful campaigns since they joined Division I hockey in 1984. Though he was held to only an assist in Lowell's final four games, Wilson finished the season second in team scoring with 38 points and was named the Hockey East Rookie-of-the-year. Returning for his sophomore season, both Wilson and the River Hawks started 2012‚Äì13 very slow. Regardless of their #7 ranking in the USCHO preseason poll, Lowell opened with a 2‚Äì5‚Äì1 mark with Wilson managing only a single goal in the 8 games. After an 8‚Äì2 trouncing of the Massachusetts Minutemen on November 18, followed by freshman goaltender Connor Hellebuyck taking over the starting role in net, the River Hawks got back to their winning ways, going 19‚Äì5‚Äì1 the rest of the way, including 7- and 9-game winning streaks. during this time Scott Wilson rediscovered his scoring touch, failing to record a point in only 8 of the 25 games after the bad start, helping Lowell cruise into the conference tournament as the number 1 seed, winning their first Hockey East regular season title. Lowell faced Maine in the first round, downing the Black Bears in straight games, 4‚Äì2 and 2‚Äì1 With Scott Wilson notching 2 goals and an assist in the two games. The second round matchup saw the River Hawks against Providence and after a quick goal from the Friars, it looked like Lowell would be ousted from the Hockey East tournament for the second time in two years, but shortly after the third period started the River Hawks tied the score, allowing Wilson to pot the game-winner with 7:30 left in the game, sending Lowell to the conference title match against the Boston University Terriers. Needing a win to enter the NCAA tournament, Boston University was unable to solve Lowell's defence, but also held the River Hawks off of the score sheet until less than 9 minutes left in regulation when Wilson assisted on the only goal of the game by Derek Arnold, earning U. Mass-Lowell their first ever Hockey East conference title. While the title victory guaranteed Lowell a spot in the NCAA tournament, their stellar play during the season allowed Lowell to be selected as one of the four #1-seeds (3rd overall) and be placed in the Northeast Regional. In the opening round Lowell was set against the WCHA conference champion Wisconsin Badgers and while Scott Wilson could only manage an assist, nothing else was required as the River Hawks demolished the Badgers 6‚Äì1. The next round matched the #2-seed New Hampshire Wildcats against Lowell and Scott Wilson was able to play hero once more, scoring the game-winner with 30 seconds left in the second period and assisting on the only other goal as the River Hawks won 2‚Äì0, sending Lowell to the first frozen four in team history. Two weeks later, when the tournament resumed in Pittsburgh, Lowell found themselves down 2‚Äì0 early in their semifinal against the Yale Bulldogs. While Lowell was able to tie the game with a pair of goals 14 seconds apart in the 3rd period, Yale scored in overtime, ending Lowell's season two wins short of a national title. 2012‚Äì13 ends up being Lowell's most successful Division I season ever in terms of wins (28) winning percentage (.707) and tournament victories (2) as well as their first conference tournament title and conference regular season title. Along the way, Scott Wilson finished tied for the team lead in goals (16) and scoring (38 points) while leading the team outright in power-play goals (6) and game-winning goals (5) despite his slow start. Professional Pittsburgh Penguins Wilson officially signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 1, 2014, and finished the 2013‚Äì14 season with the Wilkes- Barre/Scranton Penguins of the AHL. His assignment to Wilkes-Barre continued for the 2014‚Äì15 season. Wilson spent most of the 2015‚Äì16 season with Wilkes- Barre, though he did see action in 24 NHL games and opened the 2016‚Äì17 season with parent team. With Chris Kunitz being a late scratch due to a foot fracture, Wilson made his NHL debut on December 2, 2014 in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the New Jersey Devils, but played a team-low 4:21 after suffering a leg injury of his own in the second period. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, Wilson played with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins for the first half of the year, leading the American Hockey League with 22 goals which earned him a regular NHL spot with Nick Bonino, Eric Fehr, Evgeni Malkin and Beau Bennett on long-term injured reserve. Wilson earned his first career point on a goal by Phil Kessel on December 21, 2015, sending a stretch pass to the right winger for a breakaway. He scored his first NHL goal on February 18, 2016, against Petr Mrazek of the Detroit Red Wings, one timing a Conor Sheary pass from the left-hand side. On March 24, Wilson suffered a lower body injury and missed the rest of the season although Pittsburgh did give him a Stanley Cup ring for his efforts. During the 2016-17 NHL season, Wilson spent the whole season with Pittsburgh, earning a second Stanley Cup ring and his name on the Stanley Cup for first time. Detroit Red Wings and Buffalo Sabres On October 21, 2017, Wilson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, along with a third-round pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for Riley Sheahan and a fifth-round pick in 2018. On December 4, 2017, Wilson was traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for a 5th-round pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. After missing the first half of the 2018‚Äì19 season with an injured ankle, the Sabres placed Wilson on waivers January 8, 2019. Having cleared the following day, Wilson was re-assigned to AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"101\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"101\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

He travels to India, where local soldiers and local maharajahs helped a handful of British traders to take over vast areas of land. Spectacular displays of imperial power dazzled the local peoples and developed a cult of Queen Victoria as Empress, mother and virtual God. In Egypt, Paxman explores Britain as a temporary peace-keeper whose visit turned into a seventy-year occupation. He travels to the desert where Lawrence of Arabia is still remembered by elder tribesmen; he brought a touch of romance to the grim struggle of the First World War and the British triumph in Palestine. Paxman suggests that Britain believed it could solve the problems that haunt the Middle East to this day. ==Episode two: Making Ourselves at Home== Paxman continues his story of Britain's empire by looking at how traders, conquerors and settlers spread the British way of life around the world by creating a very British home. In India early British traders adopted Indian costume and many took Indian wives; their descendants still look fondly on their mixed heritage. In Victorian Britain such inter-racial mixing became taboo, especially as more British women began to settle in the colony and form families with British colonials. In Singapore he visits a club, now open to all, where British colonials used to gather together; in Canada he finds a town of Scottish ancestry whose inhabitants proud of the traditions, and have shops selling imported Scottish goods; in Kenya he meets descendants of the first white settlers, who were bitterly resented as pressure for African independence grew; and he traces the story of an Indian family in Leicester, whose migrations resulted from the changing fortunes of the British empire. ==Episode three: Playing the Game== Paxman traces the growth of a peculiarly British type of hero - adventurer, gentleman, amateur, sportsman and decent chap, and the British obsession with sport. He travels to East Africa, following the paths of Victorian explorers searching for the source of the Nile; to Khartoum in Sudan to tell the story of General Gordon; to Hong Kong, where the British indulged their passion for horse racing by building a spectacular race course; and to Jamaica, where the greatest imperial game of all, cricket, became a battleground for racial equality when the West Indies white captain was replaced by a black man. ==Episode four: Making a Fortune== Paxman looks at how the empire began as a pirates' treasure hunt. Privateers such as Henry Morgan robbed Spanish ships, largely in the Caribbean. Their naval expertise supported an informal empire based on trade and developed into a global financial network. He travels to Jamaica, where the production of sugar by Africa slaves generated the wealth of plantation owners; then to Calcutta, where British traders became the new princes of India. Unfair trading was a catalyst for the independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, whose visit to Britain and the mill town of Darwen in 1931 is remembered by two Lancashire women, who were children at the time. The First Opium War was caused by British trade in opium with the Chinese, in defiance of Chinese law,; Britain's subsequently took over the island of Hong Kong. ==Episode five: Doing Good== Paxman relates how a desire for conquest developed into a mission to improve mankind in other places, especially in Africa, by introducing benefits of British society and education. In Central Africa he travels in the footsteps of David Livingstone who, although a failure as a missionary, became a legend. A flood of Christian missionaries followed him and founded schools, one of which today has 8000 pupils. In South Africa, Paxman tells the story of Cecil Rhodes, a maverick with a different sort of mission, who believed in the white man's right to rule the world and took vast swathes of land for the British Empire.

Associate editor of The Guardian, Michael White, said that \\"the structure of the programme was ramshackle\\" and he found the narrative to be \\"episodic and superficial\\". He said that Paxman \\"was diffident charm itself\\", as opposed to treating \\"the former subjects of empire with his customary ... abrasiveness\\". While White also found \\"the photography pretty as always\\", he concluded that \\"the overall effect was curiously patronising, serving to reinforce the impression that the great man was basically on a jolly and going through the motions\\". Stuart Jeffries, also for The Guardian, offered similar views, concluding that \\"Jeremy Paxman fails to argue strongly enough\\". Nick Wood, for the Daily Mail, stated that Paxman's approach was \\"all too predictably straight out of the cultural commissar's lecture notes\\", calling the series \\"cartoon propaganda\\"; Wood concluded that it \\"may be Mr Paxman, cowed like those poor dupes in 1897, was merely issuing a coded cry for help, hoping that a latter-day viceroy like the imperious Curzon, might free him from the mental chains of the Beeb's script writers\\". == References  External links == * * Category:2010s British documentary television series Category:2012 British television series debuts Category:2012 British television series endings Category:BBC television documentaries about history Category:Works about the British Empire ","title":"Empire (2012 TV series)"},{"id":"35183451","text":"Shabalinsky (masculine), Shabalinskaya (feminine), or Shabalinskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Shabalinsky District, a district of Kirov Oblast, Russia *Shabalinskoye, a rural locality (a village) in Kirov Oblast, Russia ","title":"Shabalinsky"},{"id":"35183464","text":"H.B.

Under the leadership of Mr Robert William Smith-Saville (General Manager of the Tramways Dept) a programme of modernisation and electrification was proposed, but in the meantime between January 1899 to October 1900 the old steam trams continued to run services between Darwen and Blackburn operated by Blackburn Corporation Tramways under an agreement with Darwen Corporation. On 31 August 1900 Smith-Saville appointed Mr William Grant (of Blackpool) as Tramway Foreman and the first electric service between Darwen and Blackburn ran on 16 October 1900. Through services were operated into Blackburn under an agreement with Blackburn Corporation Tramways. On 12 October 1901 a further extension of the tramway system opened between Darwen and Hoddlesden. William Grant departed to Rotherham Corporation Transport in early 1903 and was replaced on 9 February 1903 by Mr Frederick J S Hosken (of Taunton) - who on 23 December 1912 was promoted to Tramways Manager on a wage of \\"¬£200 per annum - without house\\". On 2 June 1915 Smith-Saville, who Hosken had replaced as General Manager, died aged 48. On 25 March 1918 Hosken's resignation was accepted after he was asked to work for the Ministry of Munitions and the management post was advertised on a wage of ¬£250 per annum. On 6 May 1918 Mr George A Newsome (of Dumbarton) was appointed the new Tramway Manager. Newsome kept the post for over 20 years until 22 December 1938 when he was dismissed (with 3 months salary) for misconduct in office. On 24 April 1939 Mr Lee Wilkes was appointed Acting General Manager. Later that year (13 September 1939) he became General Manager and Chief Engineer and remained in post until he departed in April 1945 to become General Manager at Chester Passenger Transport.

Characteristic of the experience is a serious challenge to an individual's value system. The book Some Do Care by developmental psychologists William Damon and Anne Colby (who are husband and wife), use the experience of Virginia Foster Durr to describe this phenomenon. Although Durr is known as a civil rights activist, in her early years she harbored racial prejudice‚Äîa result of her upbringing in the South. When Durr was a student at Wellesley College, her prejudiced value system was first seriously challenged. On her first night at Wellesley, Durr refused to dine at the same table at which a Negro girl was sitting. The head of the house explained that the rules of Wellesley College required Durr to dine with the girl for one month, and that if Durr did not comply, she would have to withdraw from the college. As Damon and Colby explain \\"this was the first time Virginia's values had ever been seriously challenged and she stayed awake all night long worrying about the dilemma\\". They later go on to quote Durr \\"That was the first time I became aware that my attitude was considered foolish by some people and that Wellesley College wasn't going to stand for it. That experience had a tremendous effect on me.\\" (pg, 99, Some Do Care). The book Educating Citizens: Preparing America's Undergraduates for Lives of Moral and Civic Responsibility, also describes the developmental significance of Durr's challenge from Wellesley: \\"[T]he incident lodged in Virginia's memory, creat[ed] a fracture in her convictions about race that contributed to their later destruction\\" (pg. 3 Educating Citizens). A Virginia Durr Moment refers to those experiences which‚Äîwhen used correctly‚Äîfoster moral development. A Virginia Durr Moment presents one with the opportunity for growth via the evolution of one's value system via seriously challenging one's value system in a manner which causes one to reflect on and, as a result of this reflection, reject it in whole or in part. When used correctly, the signature causal sequence of a Virginia Durr Moment consists in: serious challenge-->self-reflection-->modification of value system-->moral development. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to use the Moment to promote growth and further his/her moral development. In the United Kingdom, some circles understand Paul McCartney's Blackbird as describing the moral development fostered by the proper usage of a Virginia Durr Moment. An individual may experience a Virginia Durr Moment and fail to use its power, thereby remaining in a condition of developmental stasis and moral immaturity. ==ReferencesBibliography== *Some Do Care: Contemporary Lives of Moral Commitment by Anne Colby and William Damon (1992; New York: Free Press). *Outside the Magic Circle: The Autobiography of Virginia Foster Durr, edited by Hollinger F.

Two less successful sequels, The Toxic Avenger Part II and The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie, were filmed as one. Director Lloyd Kaufman realized that he had shot far too much footage for one film and re-edited it into two. A third independent sequel was also released, titled Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV. An animated children's TV series spin-off, Toxic Crusaders, featured Toxie as the leader of a team of mutated superheroes who fought against evil alien polluters. The cartoon series was short-lived and quickly cancelled. In 2019, it was announced that Legendary Pictures would be making a reboot of the film, with original creators Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz of Troma Entertainment serving as producers, and Macon Blair serving as writer and director. The films generally follow the heroic exploits of Melvin Ferd, a weak and skinny janitor turned into the deformed and mutated superhero, the Toxic Avenger, or \\"Toxie\\", by exposure to toxic chemicals. All films in the series were released by Troma Entertainment, known for producing low budget B-movies with campy concepts and gruesome violence. Virtually ignored upon its first release, The Toxic Avenger caught on with filmgoers after a long and successful midnight movie engagement at the famed Bleecker Street Cinemas in New York City in late 1985. It eventually came to be regarded as a cult classic. ==Films== * The Toxic Avenger (film) ‚Äì original cult film * The Toxic Avenger Part II ‚Äì sequel * The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie ‚Äì sequel * Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV ‚Äì sequel ==Television series== * Toxic Crusaders ‚Äì an animated spin-off ==Musical== * The Toxic Avenger (musical) ‚Äì musical based on the film The Toxic Avenger ==Video game== * Toxic Crusaders (video game) ==Cast and characters== > Key * A indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the > character. * An indicates a role as an older version of the character. * A > indicates the actor or actress lent only his or her voice for his or her > film character. * An indicates the model served as a body double, with the > actor or actress's likeness superimposed onto the model. * An indicates the > actor or actress lent only their likeness for his or her film character. * > An indicates an appearance through a photographic still. * An indicates an > appearance through archival footage or audio. * A dark gray cell indicates > the character was not in the film. {  style=\\"text-align:center; width:99%;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"width:16%;\\" Character ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Original series ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Animated series ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:10%;\\" Sgt.

Bestattung Wien provides undertaking services almost 18,500 times a year. These include some 8,500 burials and 2,500 cremations, as well as other activities such as exhumations, repatriations and third-party services. According to several media reports Bestattung Wien has a quasi monopoly for funeral services in Vienna. Bestattung Wien has almost 400 staff, of whom 60 are employed at the Atzgersdorf coffin factory (Breitenfurter Strasse 176, 23rd district). The factory, established in 1919, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bestattung Wien. It makes 25,000 coffins a year, meeting the entire needs of Vienna and a quarter of those of the rest of Austria. In 1994 the firm was honoured by award of the Austrian state coat of arms for outstanding services to industry. Bestattung Wien's headquarters are home to the Vienna Funeral Museum.

This forced him to rebel, and after being defeated he defected to the Abbasid Caliphate and was recognized there as Byzantine emperor. ==Biography== Seal of Elpidius Nothing is known of Elpidius before February 781, when Empress Irene (r. 780‚Äì802) appointed him as governor (strategos) of the theme of Sicily. At the time, he already held the highest Byzantine dignity, that of patrikios, and the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor simply mentions that he had held the governorship of Sicily in the past, either under Leo IV the Khazar (r. 775‚Äì780) or possibly Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775)... Soon after, however, on 15 April, Irene was informed that he had supported a plot, discovered in October of the previous year to depose her and elevate the Caesar Nikephoros, the eldest surviving son of Constantine V, to power. Irene immediately dispatched the spatharios Theophilos to Sicily to bring Elpidius back to Constantinople. Although his wife and children were left behind in Constantinople, Elpidius refused the summons and was supported by the people and the local army. It does not seem that Elpidius declared himself explicitly in revolt against Irene, but the Empress nevertheless had his wife and children publicly whipped and imprisoned in the capital's praetorium. In autumn of 781 or early 782, Irene dispatched against him a large fleet under a trusted court eunuch, the patrikios Theodore. Elpidius's own military forces were meager, and after several battles he was defeated. Along with his lieutenant, the dux Nikephoros (probably the commander of Calabria), he gathered what remained of the theme's treasury and fled to North Africa, where the Arab authorities welcomed him. There, he had himself proclaimed emperor, a claim that was formally‚Äîbut apparently not very seriously‚Äîacknowledged by the Abbasid government.. His life thereafter is obscure, except for his participation in a large-scale campaign (reportedly 40,000 men) against Byzantium in 792 or 794. The Abbasids probably hoped that they could set him up as a rival emperor in at least part of Asia Minor, but the invading army was met with the onset of an early and heavy winter, losing many men to cold, and was forced to retreat.. According to Syriac sources, he was still alive in 802, when Irene was deposed by Nikephoros I (r. 802‚Äì811). When learning of this event, he is said to have advised Abd al-Malik ibn Salih, Emir of Mesopotamia, to \\"throw away his silk and put on his armour\\", as Nikephoros would pursue a more aggressive policy against the Abbasids than Irene.. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:8th- century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine defectors Category:Byzantine generals Category:Byzantine usurpers Category:Byzantine people of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Category:Byzantine governors of Sicily Category:Patricii ","title":"Elpidius (rebel)"},{"id":"35183706","text":"Ladislaus L√∂b (born 8 May 1933) is Professor Emeritus of German at the University of Sussex in England.

The group consisted of around 1,600 Jews who were given safe passage out of Hungary to Switzerland, as a result of a deal struck between Adolf Eichmann and the Hungarian lawyer and Zionist leader Rudolf Kastner. The group was detained in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hannover, Germany, before Eichmann allowed them to leave for Switzerland in two batches, in August and December 1944. In the 1950s in Israel, Kastner was accused of collaboration and murdered by Jewish extremists. ==Education and career== In Switzerland L√∂b spent two years at the Ecole d‚ÄôHumanit√©, before attending the Realgymnasium of Z√ºrich from 1948 and studying English and German at the University of Z√ºrich from 1953 to 1961.

Length 208'; beam 38'; depth 15'. Conister had a registered tonnage of and was powered by a 7-cylinder T.D.36 Sulzer engine which developed 1,260 indicated horsepower. This gave Conister a service speed of 11 knots. ==Service life== The ship entered service with Zillah Shipping & Trading Co Ltd, Liverpool, in 1955 and was named Brentfield. Brentfield was subsequently sold in 1958 to Coast Lines Ltd, Liverpool, and then in 1965 to Burns & Laird Lines Ltd, Glasgow. Sold back to Coast Lines Ltd in 1968, her services were retained until she was again sold, this time to the Belfast Steamship Company in 1972, and renamed the Spaniel. In the early 1970s containerization resulted in a marked upsurge in freight business to and from the Isle of Man. In 1973 alone, there was a 31 percent rise in cargo. It was first expected that , operating alongside would be able to meet this demand and the company sold their other general cargo vessel, at the beginning of 1973. However, the majority of cargo shipping soon switched to containers, and given Ramseys deficiencies in handling containerized cargoes, it became apparent that a second container vessel would be needed to expedite matters. The Spaniel was chartered as a container ship by the Steam Packet Company early in 1973, and bought outright by them in November of that year. The consideration was ¬£96,711 (equivalent to ¬£ in ); and upon her purchase she was renamed Conister. ==Disposal== By the early 1980s it was apparent to the Steam Packet that in order to compete with their then rival Manxline, the introduction of a RO-RO cargo service was necessary. Both Conister and (III) were put up for sale, and a new cargo vessel NF Jaguar was chartered - this vessel went on to be purchased, and renamed (IV).

Brewing companies vary widely in the volume and variety of beer produced, from small nanobreweries and microbreweries to massive multinational conglomerate macrobreweries. In 2012 Mississippi's three brewing establishments (including breweries, brewpubs, importers, and company-owned packagers and wholesalers) employed 30 people directly, and more than 6,800 others in related jobs such as wholesaling and retailing. Altogether, three people in Mississippi had active brewer permits in 2012. Including people directly employed in brewing, as well as those who supply Mississippi's breweries with everything from ingredients to machinery, the total business and personal tax revenue generated by Mississippi's breweries and related industries was more than $128 million. Consumer purchases of Mississippi's brewery products generated more than $101 million extra in tax revenue. In 2012, according to the Brewers Association, Mississippi ranked 51st (including the District of Columbia) in the number of craft breweries per capita, with three . For context, at the end of 2013 there were 2,822 breweries in the United States, including 2,768 craft breweries subdivided into 1,237 brewpubs, 1,412 microbreweries and 119 regional craft breweries.

They ran at a high speed, of several hundred rpm,, 400 to 1,200 rpm which was needed by tasks such as electricity generation. == Defining characteristics == Peter Brotherhood engine around 1900, supplied to the Royal Navy for on-board generation They have two primary characteristics: * High speed. : This is sufficient to drive a small dynamo directly, rather than needing a step-up drive by belts. * Accurate speed regulation. : Generation by dynamo requires a stable rotation speed for a stable output voltage, even when the load changes. When an alternator was being driven, the output frequency also depended upon a stable rotation speed. These also resulted in a number of secondary characteristics. Although these were not defining to the type, or were always the case, they were recognisably common: * Improved lubrication, as required by their high speed. : This often used an enclosed crankcase with an oil sump and lubrication by 'splash' or by ring oilers. Some went so far as to have engine- driven oil pumps and a circulation system. * Small, rigid cast iron frames, so that they did not require the large stationary engine's usual complex masonry foundations. * Single-acting cylinders. : As the crankcase became more important for lubrication, the layout was simpler if steam pressure was only applied to one side of the cylinder. This has a second advantage: as the steam's force is now only on one side of the piston, the force on the bearings will still vary through the stroke, but it no longer reverses its direction. This reduces the effects of any bearing slop at high speed. High speed was not needed for electrical power generation in the largest citywide plants. As these plants were necessarily large, they could also use large-diameter dynamos with many pole pieces. This gave the necessary linear speed (in poles passed / time) for a lower rotational shaft speed. These engines were produced with either simple or compound operating cycles. Smaller examples were usually simple, as the difficulties of achieving good regulation outweighed the efficiencies of compounding. High-speed engines did develop a reputation for profligacy. For larger engines the fuel cost savings were worthwhile and compound designs such as the Willans engine were used. They also used a wide range of valves. Examples with either slide or piston valves were common. Multi-cylinder single-acting engines typically shared one piston valve between two cylinders, either between the cylinders or horizontally above them. The valvegear driving these valves was usually simple, a single eccentric designed only to run at one speed, in one direction, for a fairly constant load. Although these engines were contemporaneous with sophisticated and efficient valvegears such as the Corliss, these trip valves were incapable of working quickly enough. Typical horizontal engine, showing the compact frame Belliss & Morcom single cylinder engine == \\"Automatic\\" engines == Ames automatic governor, with centrifugal bob-weight and leaf spring A key requirement for the high-speed steam engine was accurate control of a constant speed, even under a rapidly changing load. Although the control of steam engines via a centrifugal governor dates back to Watt, this control was inadequate. These early governors operated a throttle valve to control the flow of steam to the engine. This gives an inadequately responsive control for the constant speed needed for electricity generation. The solution developed for high-speed steam engines was the \\"automatic\\" governor. Rather than controlling the flow rate of steam, it controlled the timing or 'cut-off' of the inlet valves. This governor was interspersed between the crankshaft and the eccentric driving the valve gear. It was often made as part of the engine's flywheel. A centrifugal bob weight in the governor moved out against a spring with increasing speed. This caused the eccentric's position to shift relative to the crank, changing the valve timing and causing an early cut-off. As this control acted directly at the cylinder port, rather than through a long pipe from a throttle valve, it could be very fast-acting. == Lubrication ==  Enclosed crankcase splash lubrication  Section of an enclosed engine, with oil splash lubrication Splash lubrication: Lubrication of the first high-speed engines, such as the Ideal (an open-crank horizontal engine), were lubricated by a development of the oil cup systems previously widespread on medium-speed stationary engines. Oil cups and multi-point lubricators could oil shaft bearings well enough and a single sight-glass could be observed by even the most careless engine driver or oiler. The difficulty was that on high-speed engines, oilers could no longer be mounted on moving parts, such as the crosshead or connecting rod. Any oil reservoir here would be churned around by the movement and such a necessarily small reserve might also be inadequate incapacity for an engine doing so much work in a small space. More care was thus given to the thoroughness of oiling, and moving parts such as the crankpin were fed by drillings through the crankshaft from oil supplies that were rotating but not moving, such as the main bearings. Centrifugal force was also used to distribute the oil. It was usual that high-speed engines would have only one or two lubricators, so that engine tending was a simpler task and less prone to breakdowns from simple carelessness and running a lubricator dry.  Single-acting engines  Twin-cylinder single-acting vertical engine with enclosed crankcase. The governor may be seen inside the crankcase. As speeds increased, the high-speed engine evolved towards its developed form of the multi-cylinder vertical engine with an enclosed crankcase. There was also a tendency to use single-acting pistons. This had two advantages, the lubrication could be provided by a generous 'splash' system within the crankcase that also helped with cooling, and secondly that the forces in a single-acting engine always act in the same way, as a compression force along the piston rod and connecting rod. This meant that even if a bearing's clearances were relatively slack, the bearing was always held tight. Slack, and thus free-running, bearings could be accepted. An example of such an engine would be the twin-cylinder Westinghouse engines. These engines used a trunk piston, as used for internal combustion engines today, where there is no separate crosshead and the gudgeon pin of the connecting rod is moved up within the piston itself. This provides a very compact layout, but obviously requires a single-acting piston. The main crankshaft bearings of this engine were provided with separate oilers that drained into the crankcase sump. It was recognised that the crankcase oil would become contaminated with water from condensed steam and blow-by from the pistons. A valve was provided for draining this collected condensate off from beneath the oil in the bottom of the deep sump.  Double-acting engines and the invention of pressure lubrication  The important concept of pressure lubrication of engine bearings began with high-speed steam engines and is now a vital part of internal combustion engines. This is both reliable as a lubrication system and also allows the use of hydrodynamic bearings ('oil wedge') that can support greater loads. The first patents for this were issued to Belliss & Morcom in 1890, from the work of their draughtsman Albert Charles Pain. Belliss & Morcom preferred double-acting cylinders, so as to produce the smallest possible engines for a given power; one of their major markets, like Peter Brotherhood, was in supplying generator sets to the Royal Navy for use in the confines of a warship engine room. The difficulty of a double-acting engine was that the direction of the forces in the connecting rod now reverses between compression and tension, so that the bearing clearances must be made tighter to avoid any rattling. Belliss and Morcom developed a two-cylinder engine of 20 bhp at 625 rpm that used a small separate oil pump to feed oil under pressure to the crank bearings, through long drilled holes in the crankshaft. This provided reliable lubrication and cooling and the pressure of the oil film was sufficient to allow the use of double-acting engines with adequate clearance to provide free running. == See also == * Willans engine * Uniflow engine * Steam motor, the application of the high-speed engine principles to steam locomotives == Notes References Further reading == * Category:Stationary steam engines Category:Steam engines by type ","title":"High-speed steam engine"},{"id":"35183846","text":"Umberto Barulli (1921 - 1993'Unit√°.

By definition, a scheme X over a Noetherian scheme S is a Pn-bundle if it is locally a projective n-space; i.e., X \\\\times_S U \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{P}^n_U and transition automorphisms are linear. Over a regular scheme S such as a smooth variety, every projective bundle is of the form \\\\mathbb{P}(E) for some vector bundle (locally free sheaf) E. == The projective bundle of a vector bundle == Every vector bundle over a variety X gives a projective bundle by taking the projective spaces of the fibers, but not all projective bundles arise in this way: there is an obstruction in the cohomology group H2(X,O*). In particular, if X is a compact Riemann surface, the obstruction vanishes i.e. H2(X,O*)=0. The projective bundle of a vector bundle E is the same thing as the Grassmann bundle G_1(E) of 1-planes in E. The projective bundle P(E) of a vector bundle E is characterized by the universal property that says: :Given a morphism f: T ‚Üí X, to factorize f through the projection map is to specify a line subbundle of f*E. For example, taking f to be p, one gets the line subbundle O(-1) of p*E, called the tautological line bundle on P(E). Moreover, this O(-1) is a universal bundle in the sense that when a line bundle L gives a factorization f = p ‚àò g, L is the pullback of O(-1) along g. See also Cone#O(1) for a more explicit construction of O(-1). On P(E), there is a natural exact sequence (called the tautological exact sequence): :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbf{P}(E)}(-1) \\\\to p^* E \\\\to Q \\\\to 0 where Q is called the tautological quotient-bundle. Let E ‚äÇ F be vector bundles (locally free sheaves of finite rank) on X and G = F/E. Let q: P(F) ‚Üí X be the projection. Then the natural map is a global section of the sheaf hom . Moreover, this natural map vanishes at a point exactly when the point is a line in E; in other words, the zero-locus of this section is P(E). A particularly useful instance of this construction is when F is the direct sum E ‚äï 1 of E and the trivial line bundle (i.e., the structure sheaf). Then P(E) is a hyperplane in P(E ‚äï 1), called the hyperplane at infinity, and the complement of P(E) can be identified with E. In this way, P(E ‚äï 1) is referred to as the projective completion (or \\"compactification\\") of E. The projective bundle P(E) is stable under twisting E by a line bundle; precisely, given a line bundle L, there is the natural isomorphism: :g: \\\\mathbf{P}(E) \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}(E \\\\otimes L) such that g^*(\\\\mathcal{O}(-1)) \\\\simeq \\\\mathcal{O}(-1) \\\\otimes p^* L. (In fact, one gets g by the universal property applied to the line bundle on the right.) == Cohomology ring and Chow group == Let X be a complex smooth projective variety and E a complex vector bundle of rank r on it. Let p: P(E) ‚Üí X be the projective bundle of E. Then the cohomology ring H*(P(E)) is an algebra over H*(X) through the pullback p*. Then the first Chern class Œ∂ = c1(O(1)) generates H*(P(E)) with the relation :\\\\zeta^r + c_1(E) \\\\zeta^{r-1} + \\\\cdots + c_r(E) = 0 where ci(E) is the i-th Chern class of E. One interesting feature of this description is that one can define Chern classes as the coefficients in the relation; this is the approach taken by Grothendieck. Over fields other than the complex field, the same description remains true with Chow ring in place of cohomology ring (still assuming X is smooth). In particular, for Chow groups, there is the direct sum decomposition :A_k(\\\\mathbf{P}(E)) = \\\\bigoplus_{i=0}^{r-1} \\\\zeta^i A_{k-r+1+i}(X). As it turned out, this decomposition remains valid even if X is not smooth nor projective. In contrast, Ak(E) = Ak-r(X), via the Gysin homomorphism, morally because that the fibers of E, the vector spaces, are contractible. == See also == *Proj construction *cone (algebraic geometry) *ruled surface (an example of a projective bundle) *Severi‚ÄìBrauer variety ==References== * * * Category:Algebraic topology Category:Algebraic geometry ","title":"Projective bundle"},{"id":"35183891","text":"The Water Industry Commission for Scotland (WICS) is the economic regulator of the water and sewerage industry in Scotland.

Published by Taylor and Francis. ==History== The tramway was associated with the efforts to develop the properties of the Seabrook Estate Company and the Seabrook Hotel Company, both promotions of Sir Edward Watkin of the South Eastern Railway. The Folkestone, Sangate and Hythe Tramways Act of 1884 authorised the construction of the line, and the South Eastern Railway Act of 12 July 1887 authorised the railway to guarantee the interest on the capital. The first section to open was from Hythe railway station to Seabrook, Kent, to facilitate the construction of the Princes Road Parade and the sea wall designed by Sir John Goode for the Seabrook Estate Company. Services started on 18 May 1891 from Sandgate School to the Seabrook Hotel. It was extended to the Red Lion Hotel, Hythe on 6 June 1892. There were five tramcars and 25 horses. The service was half-hourly and the fare was 3d. A storm between 10 and 14 February 1899 damaged the tramway on Sandgate seafront. A stretch of sea wall was breached opposite Wellington terrace. An act of parliament on 4 August 1906 authorised the Folkestone, Hythe and Sandgate Tramways Company to take over the system from the South Eastern Railway. ==Closure== During the First World War the military commandeered the horses and services were suspended on 7 August 1914.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Nantwich, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield, and the diocese of Chester. Its benefice is combined with that of All Saints and St Paul, Crewe. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== St Peter's began as a prefabricated mission church to St Paul's, Crewe, in 1894. In 1912 the structure was moved and re-erected elsewhere, being dedicated to All Saints the following year. Building of the present church began in 1914 and was completed in 1923. The architects were J. Brooke and C. E. Elcock. Construction of the church was delayed because of funding problems caused by the First World War. The new church was dedicated on 5 May 1923. St Peter's became a separate parish in its own right in 1931, and was consecrated on 29 April of that year. ==Architecture== The church is constructed in red sandstone ashlar with a green slate roof. From the west its plan consists of a narthex, a two-bay baptistry with narrow aisles, which leads to a three-bay nave with wider aisles, then a two-bay chancel with an organ chamber on the north and a vestry on the south. Each bay of the wider aisles is gabled, the gables containing Perpendicular-style windows interspersed with lancet windows containing stained glass. On the west gable is a double bellcote surmounted by a cross finial. Inside the church, behind the altar, is a reredos carved with The Last Supper. The chancel contains a sedilia and choir stalls. The pulpit is in oak. The stained glass includes windows by D. Brookes of Weirs Glass dating from the middle of the 20th century, and an earlier window in the baptistry depicting Saint Peter. The organ was built in 1932 by Whiteley, and modified in 1984 by Sixsmith. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Crewe ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Cheshire Category:Grade II listed churches in Cheshire Category:Churches completed in 1923 Category:20th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Anglican congregations established in the 19th century Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Cheshire Category:Diocese of Chester Category:Buildings and structures in Crewe ","title":"St Peter's Church, Crewe"},{"id":"35184002","text":"Vida Brest (true name Majda Peterlin) (21 July 1925 ‚Äì 10 November 1985) was a Yugoslav Slovene-language poet, writer, journalist, and teacher, best known for her juvenile fiction, often based on her own experiences as a young Partisan during the Second World War.≈†entrupert municipal site Brest was born in ≈†entrupert in Lower Carniola in 1925.

This Process Industry Cluster has been created by the chemistry using industries based in North East England where more than 1,400 companies are based in the supply chain of the sector. The sector has over 35,000 direct employees and some 190,000 indirect employees in the northeast of England and together they represent over one third of the industrial economy of the region. Companies in the Cluster manufacture 50% of the UK's Petrochemicals and 35% of the UK's Pharmaceuticals and they significantly contribute towards making the region the only net exporting region of the UK. The region has over ¬£13 billion of exports. NEPIC was created in 2004 by the leaders of local chemistry based process industry companies that are based in the northeast of England. The aim of the organisation being to represent and coordinate industry's collaborative activities on the wide ranging issues that impact on the future and performance of the energy intensive process sector, which includes petrochemicals; specialty chemicals; polymers; pharmaceuticals; biotechnology and renewables. These issues include renewable and more sustainable energy opportunities, innovation and R&D; interests, energy pricing capacity and availability, carbon taxation and carbon emission reduction technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), graduate and technician skills for the sector and industry growth to ensure that the region remains a globally important location for the chemical industry. NEPIC has been recognised by the Chemical Industries Association (CIA) in the UK for its work in informing stakeholders about the sector and by the professional institutions in the UK for its engagement and representation of industry issues. The Northeast of England is recognised and promoted by the Department for International Trade (DIT)( formerly UK Trade and Investment (UKTI)) arm of the UK Government as a leading location in the UK for Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) into the chemistry using industries. Since its formation NEPIC has participated in European Cluster development programmes. During 2012 NEPIC was initially audited by the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis (ESCA) and in March 2014 achieved the Gold Label standard for Cluster management under this quality management scheme. NEPIC is classified by ESCA as a manufacturing and innovation cluster and was the first UK cluster to achieve this Gold Label status and the 37th Cluster to do so in Europe. By March 2014 there were 490 EU Cluster organisations accredited by ESCA. By September 2014 the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis reported that more than 600 Clusters had been audited and in their report, entitled \\"Cluster Organisations in Europe ‚Äì insights from Bronze and Gold Label Assessments\\", cited the NEPIC Members Directory as best practice as a Cluster global marketing tool. On 20 October 2014 at the European Commission's Bi-annual European Cluster Conference, policy makers, analysts and Cluster managers, from all business and industry sectors across Europe, named Dr Stan Higgins, NEPIC CEO, as European Cluster Manager of the Year 2014. NEPIC was reassessed by ESCA during 2016 and is validated as a Gold Label Cluster until February 2019 when the Cluster's management organisation has to undergo its next quality assessment. By March 2017 986 Clusters had been awarded Bronze, Silver and Gold Labels from 40 countries. 81 of which are Gold Label. NEPIC is led by industry through its Industry Leadership Team. These industry leaders at intervals of their choosing elect a person to be the Chair of NEPIC. Since its inception the cluster has been Chaired by Ian Shott CBE, Robert Coxon OBE, Paul Booth MBE and most recently former MP Ian Swales who is the current chair person. Dr Stan Higgins has been NEPIC's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) since its formation in 2004. Dr Higgins announced that he is to retire during 2017. On 1 June 2017 NEPIC announced that former Chair of the UK Parliamentary Business Committee and labour MP Iain Wright is to become the CEO of NEPIC. ==Stakeholder activity== NEPIC's work with stakeholders of the process industry in its region includes encouraging school children to study Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics (STEM subjects). It has run programmes for both secondary and primary school children. In showing the relevance of science and industry to primary school children NEPIC promotes the Children Challenging Industry programme operated by the Chemical Industry Education Unit at York University. The Cluster, in March 2009, enabled a group of school children from Morpeth, Northumberland, to record in the Guinness Book of Records the world's largest mathematics class. The Cluster also supports a Fellowship to encourage young scientists and engineers to experience Parliamentary processes by spending time in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST), based in the Houses of Parliament, Westminster, London. This annual Fellowship commemorates the life of Chemical Engineer and Member of Parliament, Ashok Kumar, who as MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, was a supporter of both the Cluster and also of the co-sponsors of the Fellowship, the Institution of Chemical Engineers. In 2017 the 6th Ashok Kumar Fellow had been appointed to work with at POST she was a postgraduate engineering student, Erin Johnson, from Imperial College, London. Annual Awards NEPIC hold a well attended Annual Awards Dinner that further cements its links to stakeholders. Awards of ¬£1000 are given to 5 Young Achievers from within its key sectors of Petrochemicals, Fine & Specialty Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology and Supply Chain. Similarly 3 x ¬£1000 prizes are given to 3 top Apprentices from the Cluster. The Cluster gives awards to the value of ¬£2000 to companies for outstanding industrial performance in Innovation, Manufacturing Sustainability and Environmental Activity. However, the award winning organisations must nominate a school to receive their prize money and use the funding for a science related project in that school. Each year a ¬£2000 Award is given directly to a local school for an Environmental project that its pupils have developed and shown that it can be implemented with the prize. The Cluster has established a prestigious Outstanding Contribution Award for an individual who in their career has made a significant contribution to the Industry in Northeast England. In 2009 this was won by Thomas Swan of Thomas Swan Ltd for his establishment of Children Challenging Industry; 2010 Garren Denham of BKE Mowlem for improving contractor safety performance; 2011 George Ritchie of Sembcorp for championing skills particularly through apprenticeships; 2012 Dr Robert Hardy for establishing and growing Aesica Pharmaceuticals in the region; 2013 Subhash Chaudharry of Fujifilm Dyosynth Biologics for his contribution to biotech engineering; 2014 Ken Home for his development of KHome an international engineering company in the region. 2015 Mark Lewis, Technical Manager of NEPIC, who during his career had helped ICI divest its engineering interests, set up the Process Industry Centre for Manufacturing Excellence (PICME)and led NEPICs technical support for the sector. Martin Inskip Plant Director of Merck Sharp & Dhome (MSD) joined the roll of honour of the sector's greatest contributors as he collected the 2016 award for Outstanding Contribution. David Hodgson Health Safety & Environment Manager of Sterling Pharma Solutions of Dudley, Cramlington, Northumberland won the 2017 Outstanding Contribution Award. All these outstanding contributors also donated their ¬£2000 prizes to local school projects. Over the 8 years to 2014 the NEPIC Annual Dinner has awarded ¬£158k in prize money that includes ¬£62k to the sectors rising young stars, ¬£90k to support STEM projects within 45 local schools and ¬£6,000 in support of new Exporters in the region. In 2017 the cumulative prize money given out to award winners at the NEPIC awards reached ¬£200,000. ¬£66,000 to young achievers and apprentices and ¬£134,000 to company award winners all of the money going to the companies being donated to School projects for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Projects. This means that 67 X ¬£2000 school projects had been supported by 2017. ==Cluster Strategy for Growth== The Industry Leadership Council of NEPIC regularly revisits the Cluster's Strategy for Growth, after first publishing it in 2006. NEPIC and the Industrialists concerned were commended for this work in the UK Parliament. The NEPIC Strategy is published and approved at the organisation's Annual General Meeting (AGM). The most recent strategy was published in December 2012. The Cluster's ongoing strategic themes include: * 1. Continue Growth Activities ‚Äì attract & develop investment. * 2. Support the National Skills Academy for the Process Industry skills development activities and ‚Äì grow apprenticeships. * 3. Grow Membership ‚Äì develop supply chain interaction & sales. * 4. Continue to provide a 'Voice for the Sector'. The new strategic themes introduced in 2012 were: * 1. Increase International awareness of the industry in the region. * 2. Improve connectivity and help bring alignment with other UK industry bodies. * 3. Develop or Support innovative projects for the rejuvenation, sustainability and growth of the industries in the process sector. * 4. Grow participation of Small & Medium Enterprises(SMEs) in all the strategic themes of the Sector. The Cluster's executive team are challenged to create and deliver projects and activities that deliver on these themes. ==Measuring NEPIC's performance== GVA creation NEPIC's overall performance against its strategy and as a Cluster body is measured in terms of economic development within its region. This is monitored by its Industry Leadership Council and public sector observers through key performance indicators (KPIs). These mostly relate to the cluster's results in attracting and assisting both indigenous and foreign direct investment (FDI) investment, as well as business growth in the local SME supply chain and any resulting job creation. These factors contribute to an overall performance measure of Gross Value Added (GVA). Results from the six year period 2005 to 2011 show that through its industry led activities, by 2017, NEPIC's activities are contributing significant levels of GVA to its local economy. to the UK economy. In December 2013 NEPIC reported to its local Members of Parliament that since 2005 the Cluster had secured 83 significant investments and 4,000 jobs which now contributes more than ¬£2 billion GVA to the local and UK economy. The ongoing work of the Cluster particularly with the Small & Medium Size (SME) business community via the Clusters Business Acceleration for SMEs (BASME) project has seen the Clusters impact on its local economy grow to ¬£2.5 Billion of GVA per annum by 2015. By 2017 the total GVA contribution of NEPIC had climbed to ¬£3.34 billion. Process industry investment Between 2005 and 2013 the NEPIC, cluster members, and its local authority partners helped to secure 83 significant investments into the process industry in the region totalling ¬£3.7 billion. The companies making significant investment during this period into the Cluster footprint include: Many of the above projects and those of other NEPIC member companies have been assisted in their investment plans by grants made available by the United Kingdom Government. The Regional Growth Fund (RGF) has supported many projects within the Cluster footprint. By 2017 the Cluster reported that it has been involved in landing 95 process industry investments into its region worth well over ¬£4 Billion and adding 5000 jobs. ==Collaborative projects== NEPIC has participated in a number of European Union funded cluster collaboration projects and collaborative innovation projects, thereby enabling its members to participate and access the benchmarking and business best practice that is being developed and shared. On some occasions NEPIC participates in the role as project leader/manager and in others as a partner organisation. An example of a Cluster collaboration in which NEPIC is a partner is the WIINTECH project, a worldwide intercluster initiative for new materials and processes focused on clean technologies. This collaborative project is aimed at building a common international strategy between 8 leading European clusters and to foster inter-cluster and transnational partnerships, extending international cooperation and developing a joint inter-cluster projects in areas such as technology and industrial partnerships, training & skills development, technology transfer, workforce and business mobility and business mentoring. NEPIC and the other Clusters involved have undertaken joint market visits to Japan, USA, Korea, Brazil, and India to promote the EU process industries while focusing on fast growing lead markets such as clean technology. The LOCIMAP collaboration on the other hand is a project that is being led and managed by NEPIC with 13 international partners who together are investigating best practice and developing new ideas for the development of more efficient industrial parks in the future. ==Innovation strategy== Research has shown that companies are eight times more innovative when working in a collaborative \\"cluster\\" environment. As part of the NEPIC Cluster Strategy for Growth, the Northeast Regional Innovation Strategy for the Chemistry-Using Process Industries was created. The innovation study and strategy was first published in 2005 and reviewed in 2010. It was created by the NEPIC Innovation Team of industrialists and academics. This work outlined a set of actions for stakeholders which have fundamentally changed the innovation performance of the region. These were: # Provide market and industry input into the direction of research and hence the need for a practical forum to discuss market trends and future industry needs # Support and develop indigenous business and technical innovation and help turn these into economic growth # Enable access to critical facilities and equipment. Recognising that access can sometimes be cost prohibitive # Do more to attract corporate R&D; centres to the region in order to move the region towards the achievement of 'critical mass' in different technologies # Help our Universities attract world class academics to the region. Recognising that having world class capability at a local university can, over time, have significant influence on the competence of local industry # Work to strengthen supply chains and customer networks in the region The NEPIC innovation strategy led to studies into the establishment of biorefinery activity within the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) which is being taken forward by the Cluster's Bioresources Team. It also identified the potential of the region to create innovation centres to support the process sector into the future. The NEPIC Innovation Strategy established the region's industrial and academic innovation strengths within the chemistry and biotechnology based process sector. The work informed both public and private interests and has led directly to the creation of several innovation centres that are now managed through a national \\"catapult\\" organisation ‚Äì the Centre for Process Innovation ‚Äì based at the Wilton Centre, Redcar on Teesside. These are the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility, the National Biologics Manufacturing Centre, the Printable Electronics Technology Centre, the Anaerobic Digestion Development Centre the Sustainable Technology Centre, and the Thermal Technologies Centre. All of these leading technology centres are facilities based on Teesside. They have \\"plug and play\\" scale up facilities in most chemical engineering and biotech engineering unit operations. They have been built as open access innovation facilities utilising over ¬£200 million of UK Government funding. All of these facilities are based in the North East of England Process Industry Cluster footprint in the north-east of England. NEPIC signposts industry towards academic programmes, projects and capability, particularity within the universities in northeast England. Arising from this Cluster activity, in September 2015, NEPIC created an innovative event enabling 90 academics to present their interests and capabilities to industry in one day; thus providing a time- efficient way to form connections. ==Business support== NEPIC provides technical, funding and business advice to new investors and indigenous businesses. To assist with industry attraction and growth, NEPIC supports companies in securing their major capital projects, management buyouts (MBO) and start-ups. The Cluster provides intelligence on local supply chain capabilities in areas such as site location, planning, infrastructure, raw material sourcing, engineering, logistics, measurement science, workforce development and legal advice. To deliver projects NEPIC partners with its Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEP) Tees Valley Unlimited and the North East LEP (NELEP). It works internationally to attract investment and partners with other European locations for the chemical industry through the European Chemical Site Promotion Platform(ECSPP). In line with the Cluster's strategy, NEPIC manages several business support products to help SMEs grow. The Cluster secured a Regional Growth Fund project to mentor 400 SMEs in this region into new business within the process sector. This is the Business Acceleration for SMEs (BASME) project through which 1000 jobs were created in the process sector supply chain over 3 years. More than 200 SME's signed up to this programme in the first 18 months and created over 170 jobs. The BASME programme has enabled NEPIC to increase the interaction between process industry companies and their local supply chain such that after 30 months 327 SMEs had engaged with it adding 425 jobs. When complete, over 3 years, the BASME project reported that it had worked with 423 SMEs and helped them with business development that resulted in 1011 jobs. Similarly NEPIC created a programme to mentor 120 SMEs to improve their carbon efficiency and to accredit their sustainability credentials. This enabled some of NEPIC's SME member's supply chain data to be available to Tier 1 companies which from 2013 onwards, in the UK, are expected to have a mandatory requirement to supply their carbon footprints on an annual basis. NEPIC's scheme called Developing Low Carbon Sustainable Industry (DEELOCSI) receives financial support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of the European Union. To further encourage SMEs in the northeast of England to Export, NEPIC collaborated with the North East Chamber of Commerce (NECC) and RTC North Limited to create a jointly owned subsidiary company Go Global Limited to manage the contract they had to deliver the United Kingdom Trade & Investment (UKTI) (2016 onwards UKTI became the Department for International Trade ‚Äì DIT), Government funded, support products and programme for all business sectors in their region. The UKTI business support products, to help grow international trade, are aimed at supporting individual SMEs to grow their exports and they also support the Cluster and its members with trade missions to new markets. In order to share knowledge with and support other business sectors in the northeast of England, NEPIC is a member of the Northern Business Forum (NBF). This business led forum also links the Cluster to wider business issues, both locally and nationally, through the local & national business membership organisations represented. Members of the forum include the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), Confederation of British Industry (CBI) North East, the Engineering Employers Federation Northern (EEF), The Institute of Directors (IOD), The North East Chamber of Commerce (NECC), Service Network, RTC North and NEPIC. The Association of North East Councils (ANEC) are amongst the observers of the forum. ==Large-scale integrated chemical processing on Teesside== The larger, and in a number of instances, integrated chemical producers in the NEPIC Cluster are based on Teesside on three large chemical sites around the mouth of the River Tees at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands that were formerly owned and operated by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). These locations have a long history of large scale chemical manufacturing even before the creation of ICI. The large scale manufacturing companies operating on these sites are sometimes called \\"commodity chemical manufacturers\\" and they make products such as petrochemicals, fertilizers and polymers. ==The River Tees and Teesport== Teesport is based on the River Tees and is currently the third largest port in the United Kingdom, and amongst the ten biggest in Western Europe. This port handles over 56 million tonnes of goods per annum which are mainly associated with the local petrochemical, chemical and steel processing industries. The port is important infrastructure for the NEPIC cluster of process companies. ==Integrated Manufacturers Group== The large scale, commodity chemical producers on Teesside work through NEPIC's Integrated Manufacturers Group (IMG) where they exchange information on infrastructure issues and also share intelligence on engineering resources for large maintenance / overhauls and capital investment projects. Such projects in the chemical process sector can require hundreds of additional contract engineers for short intense periods of time and this requires extensive engineering planning. The maintenance of chemical plant is an engineering profession in its own right. ==Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)== The NEPIC IMG of manufacturers are amongst the largest single point producers of carbon dioxide in the United Kingdom and they have created within NEPIC the Process Industry Carbon Capture and Storage Initiative (PICCSI) to study the possibility of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) solution being provided for industry on Teesside as well as for any carbon based energy production. This CCS technology option is being considered as a result of climate change regulations and the carbon taxation that could become a prohibitive cost for such energy intensive industries. NEPIC's persistent message, through its PICCSI group, that CCS is an important technology for the sustainability of energy intensive and carbon intensive industries in the UK such as chemical, polymer and fertilizer manufacturing, was endorsed during December 2013 by the UK Government. Until then CCS was only seen as a way of limiting carbon dioxide emissions from power generation, but with the Government's approval of the Tees Valley City Deal it included money for the industry to develop its early engineering study to determine CCS implementation costs and operating parameters. The process industry in the Tees Valley sees opportunities not only to store the carbon but also the potential to use the gas for other industrial uses, such as advanced oil recovery, manufacturing polycarbonates for plastics and battery electrolytes etc. The work of the Cluster on Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS) has received support from the UK Government through the Local Enterprise Partnership Tees Valley Unlimited. 6 Industrial Members of the NEPIC Cluster BOC-Linde, CF Fertilizers (formerly GrowHow), Lotte Chemicals, Sembcorp Utilities and SABIC are part of a project called \\"The Teesside Collective\\". A project was undertaken on behalf of the sector to determine the potential for a ICCS system. The study outlined the engineering cost of a system, the business case and investment mechanisms that would need to be addressed in establishing an operating ICCS system. This report was delivered to the UK Government on 1 July 2015. The Teesside Collective project identifies that 5.6% of the UK's industrial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) comes from the Teesside Region and that this location has 5 of the UK's top 25 CO2 emitting plants, concluding that Teesside is the most concentrated industrial cluster in the UK making an ICCS network technically feasible. The report states that by using existing and proven technologies, an initial 2.8m t/y of CO2 could be captured, a quarter of Teesside's total CO2 emissions, and store it permanently in aquifers beneath the North Sea., Carbon dioxide is already collected on Teesside for commercial use by some of NEPIC's members and in capturing the gas for sequestration via ICCS implementation only needs to scale up existing technologies not new ones. A future ICCS network would encourage investment from companies whose processes cannot avoid CO2 emissions, as well as from new industries that may utilise CO2 as a raw material. Early stage design contracts have been awarded to understand engineering and running costs of an ICCS system on Teesside. These studies show that a viable finance proposal is possible to support a CCS network based on Teesside. The study suggests that the cost of a Teesside-based ICCS system including access to a transportation and storage network would be ¬£58 per tonne of CO2 and compares this to Government subsidy given to offshore wind at ¬£200/tCO2 and ¬£128/tCO2 for nuclear power. This work proclaims that the Tees Valley could be \\"the birthplace of vital clean industrial growth, attracting inward investment and job creation.\\" ==Shale gas and underground coal gasification== NEPIC members are also studying the prospect of energy production from unconventional gas sources including energy from waste, energy from biomass, shale gas and underground coal gasification. Several energy from waste plants are already present in this region and more are being constructed. The region is close to large reserves of shale gas and coal and commercial exploitation of these reserves is being considered. The shale gas deposits close to this region that are available for exploitation by the process known as \\"fracking\\" exceed 1.3 quadrillion cubic feet of natural gas, although not all of this will be extractable. The extraction of shale gas in the UK has been the subject of two major reports, one from the Institute of Directors called \\"Getting Shale Gas Working\\" and one from the UK Government entitled the \\"Bowland Shale Gas Study\\". In addition, the region has substantial unexploited coal reserves in the Durham Coalfield and companies are developing plans to exploit this using modern clean technologies for underground coal gasification (UCG). Linking technologies for UGC or other gas extraction from local coalfields to carbon dioxide capture technologies like those described in the \\"Teesside Collective Project\\" gives rise to the prospect of \\"Clean Coal\\" as a source of raw materials for the chemical sector in the northeast of England. ==Skills & education== Quality skills NEPIC has taken a lead in skills development and are encouraging young people into science and engineering. The Cluster's Skills Industry Leadership Team developed a Skills Strategy to support the growth of the sector and this led directly to the creation of the National Skills Academy for the Process Industries (NSAPI) which has its head office in Darlington in the region and is part of the COGENT Sector Skills Council (COGENT SSC). COGENT and NSAPI developed skills profiles for most jobs in the process sector and these are becoming the standards for the industry across the UK. These are known as the \\"Gold Standards\\". The Skills Academy is also accrediting those delivering apprenticeships and courses into the sector, effectively, approving quality of delivery and course content. COGENT also operate a very effective career web site known as the \\"Career Pathway\\" covering all the sub sectors of the Process Industry. It shows detailed job profiles and key skill requirements for most roles in the sector as well as career options. Attracting young people into science and engineering Regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, interest in science begins in early childhood. Nearly 60 percent of scientists say they first became interested in science by age 11. Furthermore, surveys have shown that 95% of Primary School Teachers are \\"uncomfortable\\" teaching science. In the UK at primary school level only 3% of teachers hold a specialist degree and Initial Teacher Training (ITT) qualification in science. Therefore, the Cluster has focused most of its efforts in encouraging children into science and engineering in primary schools and improving teaching resources by supporting the Children Challenging Industry (CCI) Programme, a curriculum- based science learning activity linked to field trips into industry. Children Challenging Industry (CCI) attracting Children to Science, Training and Resourcing Primary Teachers This programme was initiated in this region by Thomas Swan of Thomas Swan and Co. Ltd. In the early 1990s Tom Swan recognised the need to engage with school children about the role of the chemical industry in our society, and commissioned a three year programme with the Chemical Industry Education Centre (CIEC, now the Centre for Industry Education Collaboration) at the University of York. The Children Challenging Industry Programme was created with the aim, to not only give primary school children an experience of science in action in industry, but also to train primary school teachers how to teach science and where to find science teaching resources. The programme includes specially designed classroom sessions with practical experiments, to capture children's interest, training for the teachers and then industrial site visits to see the science taught put into action. At the start of the lessons the children often perceive industry as \\"noisy, dark and hot\\". After the Children Challenging Industry experience 90% of children completing questionnaires demonstrated a more positive and informed attitude towards the industry and the desirability of a career in industry. Studies have shown that 92% of the children enjoyed the industrial experience of science and 98% of teachers reported that the training was either excellent or good. The CCI programme has operated in this region since its inception in the 1990s and its effectiveness has undergone regular evaluation. To demonstrate the impact, over a 10 year period from 1998-2007, 48,000 children, 9,500 teachers in 1600 schools received the programme across the North of England. Studies in secondary schools of pupils that have received a Children Challenging Industry Experience found that 66% of the pupils remembered learning about industry and were significantly more likely to have positive views about industry and science, in fact 40% of the secondary school pupils responded that the CCI lessons had helped with subsequent science classes. In 2010 Tom Swan received the NEPIC Cluster Life Time Achievement Award from his peers in the process sector for his work in the development and support of Children Challenging Industry. In 2007, and in 2013 he received an honorary degree form the University of York, the NEPIC CCI teacher Ms Nicola Waller won a national award from the Institute of Physics as the UK's best Primary School Science Teacher. Some Cluster members have grown their own staff development programmes using this CCI model, Johnson Matthey for example has created their future scientist programme out of this CCI activity. Such activity complements the company's \\"sustainability\\" and \\"reputation in the community\\" programmes. Due in part to the effectiveness of the Children Challenging Industry (CCI)programme some educationalists now contend that laboratory based school science teaching needs to be complemented by out‚Äêof‚Äêschool science learning that draws on the actual world (e.g. through field trips to industry etc.), the presented world (e.g. in science centres, botanic gardens, zoos and science museums), and the virtual worlds that are increasingly available through information technologies. ==Turning interrelated sectors into a cluster== NEPIC logo and sectors In 1989, Michael Porter said \\"Clusters are groups of inter-related industries that drive wealth creation in a region\\". Even in 2017 these concepts are still of academic interest and at the beginning of the 21st century continue to drive industrial policy in growing economies. For example in India and Malaysia news articles and research papers still promote Porter's approach to economic development, adding that clusters \\"typically include the entire value chain of a broadly defined industry from suppliers to end products, and are interconnected by the flow of goods and services throughout this chain. They help improve resource efficiency, time management as well as bring in innovation in manufacturing practices.\\" This notion of broad science-based industries linking together to address cross cutting issues such as growth, sustainability, skills, innovation, infrastructure, stakeholder engagement, sharing best practice and providing a significant representational voice is what brought together the chemical, pharmaceutical, polymer, speciality materials, biotechnology and renewable energy and materials companies based in the northeast of England to create a cluster body to coordinate their work. NEPIC has two offices in the region: one in the north in Sunderland and one in the south at Wilton near Redcar in Teesside. At the Wilton location, NEPIC is amongst several process sector and supply chain companies that work out of the process industry research centre Wilton International. The UK Innovation Catapult, the Centre for Process Innovation, is also based in this multi-occupancy technical development centre. Chemicals The chemical companies in the membership of NEPIC can be categorised into three groups: petrochemical, commodity chemical, fine and speciality chemical companies. The petrochemical and commodity chemical companies are those most likely to utilise large infrastructure such as pipelines, storage facilities, utilities, power stations, port facilities and railways. These companies in this Cluster are almost exclusively based on Teesside, mostly on three chemical industrial parks at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands. Examples of large scale commodity manufacturers in the NEPIC Cluster are Sabic making ethylene, low-density polyethylene and aromatics, Ineos acrylonitrile, GrowHow ammonia and ammonia based fertilizers, Ensus bioethanol and animal feed, Phillips 66 oil refining, Omya Calcium Carbonate, Huntsman polyurethane intermediates and titanium dioxide, Harvest Energy biodiesel and Greenergy fuel blending. These commodity chemical companies used to share logistical, utility and other infrastructure with Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) who made steel in Redcar until final closure in October 2015. This was Europe's second largest operational blast furnace. TATA Steel still operate steel milling and rolling units on Teesside. The speciality chemical and fine chemical companies in the NEPIC Cluster are spread across all the sub-regions of northeast England including Teesside, County Durham, Tyne and Wear and Northumberland. Examples on Teesside: Fine Organics, Chemoxy, Vertellus, Johnson Matthey, Koppers, Lucite International and Mitsubishi Chemicals. In County Durham: High Force Research, Newchem Technologies, Thomas Swan, Exwold Technology and Huntsman Tioxide, and Frutarom. In Tyne and Wear and Northumberland Kilfrost, Akzo & International Paint and Chemson all manufacture speciality chemicals while Aesica, Sterling Pharma Solutions and Piramal make and use fine chemical intermediates mostly as pharmaceutical intermediates. Companies in the NEPIC footprint are also involved in the scale up, manufacture and commercialisation of Graphene, Applied Graphene Materials and Thomas Swan Limited. The UK Government has also chosen this Cluster to base its National Graphene Applications Centre. The above chemical companies are also supported by specialist utility providers and speciality gas providers such as Sembcorp and BOC-Linde, bulk storage businesses such as Simon Storage and Vopak, while speciality packaging and formulation of chemicals is provided by companies such as Banner Chemicals, MP Storage and Exwold who also all operate Teesside facilities. Throughout the whole region Northumbrian Water can provide bulk water and also waste water treatment facilities to the all sectors of the process industry. The region is self-sufficient in water and can allocate industrial quantities to new investors due to the development of the Kielder Reservoir. Polymers Polymer manufacturing in the northeast of England Process Industry Cluster has some large-scale activity based on Teesside. SABIC operate one of the world's biggest low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plants, which makes the United Kingdom a net exporter of LDPE. Lotte Chemical manufacture both purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Ineos manufacture acrylonitrile, an intermediate used for Nylon 66 and acrylics. Speciality polymer products are also made there. Ineos, for example, also manufacture aqueous polyvinylchloride PVC products in County Durham whilst Victrex manufacture all the monomer for their polyether ether ketone (PEEK) product at their facility on Teesside. There are also new biopolymers and resins in development and scale up by companies such as Plaxica, which is developing new processes to commercialise polylactic acid (PLA) and Cambridge Biopolymers, who are commercialising functional bioresins; both are based at the Teesside process industry research centre Wilton International. New processes for the recycling of polymers have also been commercialised at Wilton. For example, Biffa Polymers recycle a large percentage of the UK's plastic milk bottles into polymer chip. This was one of the first technology applications which allowed food-grade polymer packaging to be recycled without passing through a melted phase. In 2013, SNF announced that they intend to build a polymer manufacturing unit on Teesside to make polyacrylamide emulsion for the oil industry. Although not strictly a polymer, the acrylic Perspex is a well known plastic like material; it and other acrylic products are manufactured in Teesside and County Durham by Lucite International, which is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi corporation. The region also has a significant number of polymer extrusion and forming companies that supply a number of advanced engineering supply chains notably the automobile supply chain which, in northeast England, is dominated by Nissan's European automobile manufacturing plant at Sunderland. The automobile supply chain in this region is represented by the North East Automobile Alliance (NEAA). Pharmaceuticals This region has an active, modern pharmaceutical industry and the northeast of England has a full capability in the pharmaceutical value chain, including pre-clinical drug discovery and development, clinical research and development, clinical trial management, pilot-scale manufacturing, full-scale pharmaceutical ingredient and intermediate manufacturing, as well as final product formulation, packaging and distribution. Furthermore, pharmaceutical businesses are underpinned by an experienced and successful supply chain. Within the NEPIC cluster there are companies that provide laboratory facilities, manufacturing sites, logistics, construction and procurement, analytical sciences, validation consultants, maintenance, operation and financial services, public relations and contingency planning. Fundamental medical research is done in this region at several of its universities. For example, Newcastle University was the first to receive a licence in the UK to perform research on stem cells and this is a leading centre for such research today. Indeed Karim Nayernia was the first to isolate spermatagonial stem cells at this University. Many new healthcare developments have arisen from this research work. Industrial drug development continues at ARCINOVA in Alnwick. Small molecule drug scale- up and process development and manufacture is provided to current good manufacturing practice(cGMP) standards to pharmaceutical companies around the world by several NEPIC Cluster members such as Aesica Pharmaceuticals, Sterling Pharma Solutions, Piramal Healthcare, all of which are based in Northumberland and also by Fine Organics on Teesside. Aesica, Sterling, Piramal (Northumberland) are companies that perform primary manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients(APIs) to cGMP standards. While Aesica, Piramal, MSD (Northumberland), Sanofi (Tyne & Wear), GlaxoSmithKline, Quantum Pharmaceuticals and Bristol Laboratories in (County Durham) are all secondary pharmaceutical manufacturers with large facilities in the region. These companies formulate and package finished pharmaceuticals ready for consumer use. Small quantity and speciality pharmaceutical formulations are also manufactured by contract manufacturers Specials Labs and SCM Pharma in Northumberland, which was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in 2014. While Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies (Teesside), formerly Avecia is one of the largest investments in the world in biopharmaceutical & biologics medicines manufacturing, the company manufactures, under contract, active biopharmaceuticals for a number of pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceuticals make up a significant proportion of the exports of the northeast of England. The region produces 33% of the UK's GDP in pharmaceutical manufacturing with 95% of finished product exported to global markets Biotechnology Biotechnology has become widely used in many industrial and academic activities and the following classifications have become established. Red Biotechnology ‚Äì Medical, Health care and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology. White Biotechnology ‚Äì Biotechnology for industrial products. Green Biotechnology ‚Äì Biotechnology applied to environmental issues. Blue Biotechnology ‚Äì Biotechnology based on marine organisms. The northeast of England has strengths in all these areas. Industrial and academic biotechnological research in Red Biotechnology has been well established in the northeast England and has developed into strengths in diagnostics, bioinformatics, Biomanufacturing, Biocatalysis & Bio-transformations, Bioremediation, Pharmaceutical research, Microbiological analysis and testing, Production of antibodies, proteins and peptides. Leading edge research is done at the region's Universities, for example Newcastle University was the first institution in Europe, second in the world, to receive permission to pursue stem-cell research in human embryos. New industries that have now developed form a significant sector in the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Fujifilm Diosynth Biologics at Billingham now employs over 550 people, the majority of them being graduate-level skills in biotechnology, to develop new products and innovative processes for the pharmaceutical industry. Within a mile of the Fujifilm complex are small companies working on the building blocks of life. Cambridge Research Biochemicals (CRB) supports discovery research activities by providing custom-made research reagents, principally peptides and antibodies. In Sunderland, Immuno Diagnostic Systems (IDS) are producing medical test kits and in Hartlepool Hart Biologicals produce diagnostic products for use in the detection, prevention, and monitoring of a number of medical conditions. In Morpeth, Northumberland Piramal Healthcare invested into bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Across the region, companies such as Leica Biosystems, Orla Proteins, Helena Bioscience, Thermo Fischer Scientific and Millipore are significant contributors to the growing strength of the sector and its supply chain. Industrial, White Biotechnology includes manufacturing, alternative energy (or \\"bioenergy\\"), and biomaterials and is also well established in the region. The manufacturers of the food protein Quorn, Marlow Foods, now part of Premier Foods, developed their technology here and still operate in this region. Northumbrian Water has invested in two large scale anaerobic digestion facilities to recover energy from their domestic and industrial waste water streams. In Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland Biotechnology has been pioneering natural solutions to handling effluents and waste materials. In Billingham, Biochemica is applying new biotechnology solutions to industrial water treatment. Biotechnology is also being applied to manufacture polymers by Plaxica and functional resins by Cambridge Biopolymers. Several of the Cluster's Fine and Specialty chemical companies are utilising enzymatic transformations in their manufacturing processes. Developments such as these are being supported by The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) which hosts the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility (NIBF) at Wilton International. Renewables and bioresources Members of the North East England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) are also focusing on development of biorefinery concepts which could impact on fine, speciality and commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and bio-fuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel. Large scale biofuels plants are already operating on Teesside by Ensus and Harvest Energy, while Greenergy (note: Harvest and Greenergy are all now part of the Interterminals Group) operate a biofuel blending facility. CF Industries (formerly GrowHow) who manufacture fertilizer is capturing carbon dioxide from their ammonia based fertilizer business and this is being used to aid the growing of tomatoes in an industrial market garden on Teesside. This reduces emissions and eliminates road miles from former European imports. Sembcorp operate a 30 MW biomass power plant known as Wilton 10 using both waste wood and coppiced wood, which is integrated into the existing chemical processes on the Wilton Chemical Site. A number of other biomass and waste to energy plants are in development within the Cluster such as Wilton 11 and MGT Power are building their Teesport Renewable Energy Plant. SITA already operate an energy from waste unit in Middlesbrough. Many of the Cluster companies working on Renewables and Bioresources projects to develop a lower carbon future for the sector collaborate through the NEPIC Clusters Bioresources Collaborative Thrust Team. The Cluster's growing strength in low carbon, sustainable industry has gained national recognition. The drive to industrialise biorefinery technologies within the NEPIC Cluster is mostly aimed at reducing carbon emissions or at making manufacturing more sustainable by counterbalancing the emissions by the reabsorption of carbon dioxide through the growth of an equivalent amount of biomass. Alternatively they are implementing technologies that enable the use of societal waste as a new basic raw material. The Chemical Engineering technologies that are being implemented include advanced gasification and Air Products are implementing their plasma gasification technology on Teesside, the company has announced that a second such unit is also to be built in this location. Others are developing projects utilising pyrolysis to recover useful materials from carbon wastes and also new processes to manufacture biosynthetic natural gas (SNG)and fuels from air being developed by Air Fuels Synthesis. Depolymerisation processes are also under investigation. The Cluster companies and new investors collaborating through the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) on renewables and bioresources projects do so through the Cluster's Bioresources Thrust Team. ==Supporting and developing an extensive supply chain== The Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Speciality, Biotechnology companies cannot operate without the support of an extensive local supply chain. Supply Chain companies within NEPIC include Analytical and Measurement Science Companies, Chemical Engineering, Control Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Process Engineering, Project Engineering, Construction Engineering, Maintenance Engineering, Toolmakers, Business and Site Security, Safety Management, Disaster and Business Recovery Management, Engineering Equipment Suppliers, Laboratory Equipment Suppliers, Business Performance Improvement Consultants, Legal Firms, Management & Strategy Consultants, Process Development, Publicity Firms, Publishers and Printers, Purchasing Companies, Recruitment Companies, Research Institutions etc. The Cluster Leadership Team believe that the promotion of the capability of these supply chain companies is crucial to its ability to attract investment to the region. Furthermore the Cluster promotes its supply chain members' businesses around the world to help them secure more business, locally, nationally and internationally. The concentration of such supply chain businesses in the northeast of England is internationally significant. In 2009 Service Network commissioned Shared Intelligence and Gavurin to undertake an assessment of the Knowledge Intensive Business & Services (KIBS) sector in the northeast of England. The report concludes that KIBS companies are distributed across the whole of the region. It identifies that the region has a particular strength in Architectural & Engineering Activities & Related Technical Consultancy (AETC) workplaces with 2810 such firms employing 13,385 people. The report also identifies that the concentration of ATEC business is the highest in the UK and around Stockton- on-Tees the concentration is amongst the highest for such businesses in Europe. ==Role of clusters such as NEPIC in globalised industries== According to Christian Ketels of Harvard Business School \\"Globalisation has not only raised the relative role of location and Clusters, it has raised the bar in terms of the demands that successful clusters have to meet.\\" Ketels suggests that this is because competition between clusters has increased and rival locations are vying for any new investment in their sectors. It is this that pressurises Cluster organisations to meet the best practice of clusters in other regions. Such competition has driven clusters to become more specialised and there is now much more differentiation, for example, some clusters are R&D; Hubs while others focus on manufacturing or are service orientated. Ketels' premise is that this increasing level of specialisation has increased linkages between cluster bodies and that the ability of the cluster management teams to make such linkages and partnerships has become an important key strength. In the past, Ketels suggests, clusters were like islands competing with each other whereas now they are part of Global supply chains often competing and co-operating at the same time. Ketels' observations are borne out by the work of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) which uses its cluster to cluster links in two ways to meet the strategic needs of its Industrial Leadership Council. Firstly, to meet its Internationalisation aims, NEPIC's cluster to cluster activities build up a wider international understanding of the capabilities of the industry in its region and also of its members specific businesses. Secondly, it uses cluster to cluster relationships to help develop the business, particularly of its Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) members, with the aim of strengthening SME businesses in its local supply chain. NEPIC does this by using its international linkages and partnerships to de-risk the initial development of international trade for its members. This is achieved by reciprocal knowledge and support of partner clusters and trade bodies and their members. NEPIC's approach is to develop formal Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)with industry clusters and business associations around the world and build partnerships to create knowledge sharing opportunities. In Europe, NEPIC has projects and agreements with the following Cluster bodies: Axelera, and through the WIINTECH consortium, Plastipolis in France, Proplast in Italy, Chemie-Cluster Bayern (CCB) in Germany, Clusterland in Austria, Plastival in Spain, Veneto Nanotech in Italy and Poolnet in Portugal. In India, with the Indian Chemical Council (ICC), the Karnataka Drug and Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (KDPMA), Gujarat Chemical Association, Vapi Industries Association, Mangalore Special Economic Zone (MSEZ) and Plastindia. In Brazil, with the Suape Coplexo Industria Portuario and in China the Jiangsu Association of Science and Technology (JASTI). NEPIC has participated in joint meetings and projects with these organisations and has often managed reciprocal visits from groups of companies associated with the aforementioned bodies and countries. These partnerships can lead to joint projects, for example, NEPIC and the Indian Chemical Council (ICC) jointly organised the Indian Chemical Industry Outlook Conference in 2013. Furthermore member companies have found new business via such Cluster to Cluster relationships, for example one SME business attending the Indian Outlook Conference in India in 2013 reported in the market visit blog that \\"the quality, seniority and number of attendees that NEPIC (and ICC) have attracted are of great credit to them. I have calculated that it would have taken me at least 4 years to meet the executives that have met in one week on this trip.\\" At the same time others reported new business being created during their first market visit with the Cluster. By 2017 NEPIC had become a key partner of the Indian Chemical Council (ICC) helping to define the agenda for their Annual Outlook Conference. The 2017 NEPIC led and UK Department for International Trade (DIT) trade mission to India had grown to include 21 business delegates who travelled to Bangalore, Pune and Mumbai meeting companies the company members of the Karnataka Drug and Pharmaceutical Association (KDPMA), Tata Research Development and Design Centre and the members of the Indian Chemical Council. With companies such as Jacobs Engineering, SMEs such as Biochimica UK Limited (water treatment), Micropore Technologies Limited (innovative dispersion & emulsification technology) and Harrison Goddard Foote (HGF) (patent agents) being very positive about their experience and showing the supply chain diversity. These companies show the diversity of the chemical process industry supply chain. ==See also== * Institution of Chemical Engineers * UK Trade & Investment * Economic clusters * Chemical Industries Association * Commodity chemicals * Fine chemicals * Speciality chemicals * pharmaceuticals * Biotechnology * chemical plant * Chemical Engineering ==ReferencesEuropean Cluster Observatory * European Cluster Collaboration Platform * Northeast Bioresources & Renewables * Children Challenging Industry Programme(CCI) Category:Chemical industry in the United Kingdom Category:Industry in England Category:Michael Porter Category:North East England Category:Science and technology in County Durham Category:Science and technology in North Yorkshire ","title":"North East of England Process Industry Cluster"},{"id":"35184098","text":"Robert Thomas Seeley (born February 26, 1932, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, United States‚Äìdied November 30, 2016, in Newton, Massachusetts) was a mathematician who worked on pseudo differential operators and the heat equation approach to the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem.

Donald Devine was born in Bronxville, New York to Frances Phelan Devine and John Devine. He was raised by his mother in his grandfather Frank Phelan's home in Brooklyn and educated at Catholic schools in New York. He lives in Shady Side, Maryland and is married to the former Ann Smith. Devine and his wife have four children and fourteen grandchildren.Murphy, p. 11 He graduated from St. John's University New York with a B.B.A. in management and economics in 1959. He was granted an MA in Political Science from Brooklyn College City University of New York in 1965. He earned a Ph.D. in political science from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University in 1967.

Yet you come out of the University and, while respecting theory, wrote a semi-memoir that is so full of political reality as to scramble the pro-business notions of the right and the pro- bureaucracy tendencies of the left.\\" Frank Gregorsky \\"Author Profile, 2009: Donald J. Devine,\\" http://www.exactingeditor.com/DonDevine.html ==Academic career== Devine was appointed Assistant Professor of Government and Politics at University of Maryland, College Park in 1967 and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 1970, serving there until 1980 teaching graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of American government and politics, public opinion and democratic theory, and methodology and philosophy of science. During this period he was identified with the empirical democracy school and earned a National Science Foundation and several University of Maryland research awards for methodological pursuits and was a popular lecturer among students, who were frustrated for not being able to guess his philosophical orientation until the final course session.Who's Who As a professor, he wrote three books and several articles in professional journals. His writing in the period emphasized relating major political philosophy themes to empirical aspects of American society and government. The first book was titled The Attentive Public: Polyarchical Democracy The Attentive Public: Polyarchical Democracy, Chicago: Rand McNally, 1970 This book was his Ph.D. thesis and was selected to be included in the prestigious American Politics Research Series, edited by Berkeley Professor Aaron Wildavsky, who supervised this series devoted to advanced methodological approaches to important aspects of American politics. Professor Arend Liphart called the book \\"an excellent example of a fresh look at one of the most basic questions in the empirical study of democracy, the relationship between popular demands and outputs.\\" Comparative Politics, March 1972, 420 Professor Samuel Kirkpatrick said it was \\"a major contribution to the literature on empirical modifications of democratic theory.\\" Midwest Journal of Political Science, May 1971, 402 Devine's most widely cited academic book was his second, The Political Culture of the United States. The Political Culture of the United States: The Mass Influence On Regime Maintenance, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1972. The book took the writings of John Locke and the American Federalist Papers and related their expectations of popular political culture with what Americans have in fact believed as represented by all of the recorded scientific polls taken by the time of the writing. This book was included as one of the featured books in the Analytical Comparative Politics Series, edited by UCLA Professor Gabriel Almond who called it \\"one of the most distinguished pieces of secondary analysis in the field.\\" Pre-publication review appearing on book dust jacket. Professor James Danielson labeled it \\"a valuable piece of synthesizing\\" of almost all published polls from the 1930s birth of opinion polls to the present.Journal of Politics, 1973, 521 Professor Glenn Parker said it added \\"appreciably to existing knowledge.\\"American Political Science Review, 1975, 268 Professor Alan Monroe said it was \\"a thorough examination of American political culture based upon survey data.\\" Public Opinion in America, New York: Dodd Meade, 1975, 105 ==Government service== In 1981, Professor Devine was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In this position he served as chief executive officer and principal policy-maker for the United States civil service: setting personnel policies for 2 million civilian government employees and managing a budget authority of $30 billion.Reagan's Terrible Swift Sword: Reforming and Controlling the Federal Bureaucracy, Ottawa: Jameson Books, 1991, pp. 202‚Äì5. During this period he also served on the Cabinet Council on Management and Administration 1982‚Äì1985, the President's Commission on White House Fellowships 1981‚Äì1985, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, 1981‚Äì1985, the President's Commission on Executive Exchange 1981‚Äì1987, and the Intergovernmental Advisory Committee on Education 1988‚Äì1990. Devine's government experiences during this period were recorded in his 1991 book Reagan's Terrible Swift Sword: Reforming and Controlling the Federal Bureaucracy The book explained how the Reagan Administration analyzed and reformed the Federal Government against the opposition of its bureaucracy and political establishment. Professor Wildavsky said that the book was \\"an extraordinarily creative combination of inside information and sophisticated social science analysis.\\" Rockefeller University Professor Richard Nathan called it \\"an important book about democracy and bureaucracy.\\" Pre-publication reviews appearing on book dust jacket. In a 2009 interview Devine presented much inside information about the bureaucracy, government and politics not contained in the written book.Gregorski, ibid. ==Devine's administrative critics== The OPM director has a term appointment for four years which for Devine ended in 1985. He sought re-appointment but withdrew his nomination in the face of political and bureaucratic opposition and testimony from his former deputy that he requested her to lie to Congress about the nature of his consultant appointment while awaiting reconfirmation.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/06/20/the- woman-who-fired-her-boss/dbacd7a8-4154-4787-9bc6-4a22abc065e8/ His primary opposition was from the federal sector unions and executive associations. As a Washington Post feature on him said, he \\"has overseen the RIF-ing of thousands of federal workers, cut salaries and expense accounts by 8 percent, reduced disability retirements by 40 percent, eliminated abortion coverage from federal health insurance programs, and threatened the automatic merit pay system‚Ä¶[plus] the sacred bulwark of the federal employee retirement system‚Ä¶.he has taken on Congress, unions, federal courts, insurance companies, other government agencies, even his own party.\\" Murphy, p. 10 As a result, \\"at the mere mention of his name, federal workers grit their teeth and express fear and loathing.\\" Congresswoman Mary Rose Oakar (D-OH) is quoted as saying he was \\"arrogant, I think he's philosophically intransigent.\\" Murphy, pp. 10‚Äì2 He was supported by the Wall Street Journal \\"Up the Ante\\" Review & Outlook, The Wall Street Journal, December 11, 1984 and the Washington Times which said he \\"succeeded astonishingly well\\" in his four years,\\"A Devine Idea\\" The Washington Times, January 28, 1985, 7A but with unified Democratic Senate opposition to his re-appointment and two Republicans with large public employee constituencies claiming he exceeded his authority, he was forced to withdraw his nomination.Phil McCombe, \\"The Devine Right,\\" The Washington Post, June 22, 1985 In promoting a decentralized and political model of administration advanced by Professor Vincent Ostrom, Devine also incurred the opposition of the professional public administration community. His speech to the American Society for Public Administration at the beginning of his term supposedly led to the largest number of requests for transcripts in the history of the organization.Donald Devine, \\"American Culture and Public Administration,\\" Policy Studies Journal, (December, 1982) Twenty years later he was still being used as a contrarian against the prevailing public administration doctrine.R. Sam Garrett, James A. Thurber, A. Lee Fritscher, and David. H. Rosenbloom, Public Administration Review, March‚ÄìApril, 2006, p.235 Other public administration scholars noted that Devine's focus on OPM as a political instrument of the executive branch lost the traditional management orientation of OPM. Subsequent directors appointed under President George H. W. Bush(Constance Horner and Constance Newman) returned OPM to its original focus. ==Political life== Devine served as a senior advisor to Governor Reagan from 1976 to 1980. His experiences in this role were published in his 1983 book Reagan Electionomics Donald Devine, Reagan Electionomics, 1976‚Äì1984: How Reagan Ambushed the Pollsters, Ottawa, Illinois: Green Hill Publishers, 1983. The book explored the social, political, and philosophical basis for the election of Ronald Reagan as President of the United States, which Publishers Weekly called a \\"significant\\" contribution to understanding the 1980 election.Publisher's Weekly, Volume 218, 1983 After leaving government he became a top advisor to Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole from 1988 to 1996 and later to publisher Steve Forbes between 1998 and 2000. Devine was fired from the 1988 Dole campaign over a bitter dispute with campaign Chairman William Brock. As president of Donald Devine Company he has been an advisor to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and many candidates for political office. He has been a Republican nominee for Congress and for state comptroller in Maryland. His 1996 book Restoring the Tenth Amendment Donald Devine, Restoring the Tenth Amendment: The New American Federalist Agenda, Ft. Lauderdale: Vytis, 1996 told the story of the \\"long time movement of American government and politics away from the federalist roots of the Constitution and how this contributed to the inability of the national government to work with so many additional responsibilities assumed from state and local governments and the private sector\\". Sen. Dole recommended it as the way to understand his desire to return powers to the states and the people, to \\"increase citizen responsibility and take back control of lives and communities.\\"Pre-publication review on book dust jacket ==Lecturer, consultant, scholar== Devine has been an Adjunct Scholar at The Heritage Foundation since 1992, producing several research papers, primarily on government management issues Between 1986 and 2000, he was a regular columnist for The Washington Times and afterwards editor of the American Conservative Union Foundation's ConservativeBattleline. In 2000, he was appointed professor of political science at Bellevue University where he served for a decade teaching in the classroom and on line, reforming its Western civilization curriculum, and writing.Who's Who? He co- edited a book of readings on Western Civilization for Bellevue University Press in 2002 to be used as course material at the university.Donald Devine, et al., Western Vision and American Values, Acton, MA: Copley/Bellevue University Press, 2002. In 2004, he published a book In Defense of the West Donald Devine, In Defense of the West: American Values Under Siege, Dallas: University Press of America, 2004. that was adopted as the textbook for the required course in Western civilization. From foreign terrorism to domestic cynicism about its once self-evident truths, this book found Western values and American institutions under siege and asked whether these values could survive or even be defended in a civilization that questions everything? Professor William Peterson called it a \\"richly philosophical and carefully documented work\\" on the roots of America's culture.William H. Peterson, \\"Back to Basics: America's Democratic Origins,\\" The Washington Times, December 28, 2004, A17 In 2011 Devine became Senior Scholar at The Fund for American Studies teaching its seminar on the U.S. Constitution to Washington DC interns and introducing a new generation to fusionist philosophy.Donald Devine, \\"The Power of Fusionism,\\" Young American Revolution, December 2009, pp. 18‚Äì20; Reagan's Fusionism Failing?\\" Conservative Battleline, February 7, 2007. In 2012, ISI Books published Devine's America's Way Back that summarized his fusionist philosophy and the conclusions for America's future he drew from it. In 2017, Jameson Books republished an abridged second edition Of his 1991 book on government administration in paper and in Kindle retitled as Political Management of the Bureaucracy: A Guide to Reform and Control. ==Fusionist philosophy== Living in New York and attending St. John's University, Devine was greatly influenced by professors John Hurley, Charles Crowley and Francis Canavan and the founding editors of National Review magazine William F. Buckley Jr. and Frank S. Meyer. Like Meyer he was also influenced by the Nobel economist/philosopher F.A. Hayek. The Liberty Fund edition of Meyer's major essays lists Devine as among a small group of his followers who most advanced Meyer's version of fusionist conservatism.William C. Dennis \\"Foreword\\" in Frank S. Meyer, \\"In Defense of Freedom and Other Essays, Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1996, xx Ronald Reagan identified this fusionism as the conservatism \\"recognized by many as modern conservatism.\\" Ronald Reagan, \\"Address to the Conservative Political Action Conference,\\" March 20, 1981, Devine is attributed by one analyst with summarizing fusionism's doctrine in one phrase as \\"utilizing libertarian means in a conservative society for traditionalist ends.\\" E.J. Dionne, Jr. Why Americans Hate Politics, New York: Simon&Schuster;, 1991, 161 Some type of fusionist solution that unites social and economic conservatism is accepted by most on the American right. But most of these refer to a political fusion rather than a philosophical resolution between the two elements, desiring a coalition of interests rather than seeing a need for a deeper philosophical resolution of both into a synthesis as required by philosophical fusionism as taught by Meyer. Both Devine's 1976 book Does Freedom Work? Donald J. Devine Does Freedom Work?: Liberty and Justice in America, Ottawa, Illinois: Caroline House, 1978 and his latest America's Way Back Donald J. Devine, America's Way Back: Freedom, Tradition, Constitution: ISI Books, 2012 are inspired by Meyer's vision and provide an extended consideration and analysis of this brand of fusionist conservatism. Following Meyer, freedom is viewed as the preeminent political value. The state has only three legitimate functions ‚Äì police, military and operating a legal system, all necessary to control coercion, which is immoral if not restricted. There is an obligation to others but it is individual, for even the \\"Great Commandment\\" is expressed in individual form: God, neighbor and oneself are individual. Freedom must be balanced by responsibility. For freedom by itself has no goal, no intrinsic ends to pursue. Freedom is not abstract or utopian as with the utilitarians, who make freedom an end rather than a means. A utopia of freedom is a contradiction in terms. In a real society traditional order and freedom can only exist together in tension. To retain the essentiality of both freedom and tradition, the solution to the dilemma is \\"grasping it by both horns\\" The solution is a synthesis of both, even in the face of those who argue that no such synthesis is possible or even logical.Meyer, In Defense of Freedom and Other Essays, pp. 74‚Äì121, 157 Does Freedom Work? is an analytical study expanding earlier work on John Locke Donald J. Devine, \\"John Locke: His Harmony Between Liberty and Virtue,\\" Modern Age, Summer, 1978 and Adam Smith Donald j. Devine, \\"Adam Smith and the Problem of Justice in Capitalist Society,\\" Journal of Legal Studies, June, 1977 and relating both classical authors to an earlier Western tradition that embraced both that tradition and their ideas about political freedom. The book then applied that political philosophy to that of America's Founders and compared these to empirical aspects of America today. Georgetown University Professor George Carey called Devine's book \\"refreshing and thought provoking,\\" Pre- publication review on book dust jacket while Professor Tibor Machan found reflecting upon its mix of philosophical and empirical research a \\"rewarding experience Tibor Machan, Policy Review, 1978, 122 and William Buckley found it \\"wonderfully useful.\\"Prepublication Review, letter dated January 4, 1978 The more recent America's Way Back started with that same combination of tradition and freedom in Western civilization arguing that what is required today is an understanding of this profound synthesis underlying the Constitution, reviving its harmony between freedom and tradition, a fusion whose tension has been the lifeblood not merely of the American experience but of all Western Civilization. As Nobel laureate Hayek concluded, \\"a successful free society will always in large measure be a tradition-based society,\\" since freedom requires law and law necessitates traditional virtue..F.A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1978, pp. 61‚Äì2 America's Way Back begins with the disturbing judgment from the nation's leading public administration expert that American government can no longer faithfully execute its laws. The 20th Century welfare state begun under Woodrow WilsonWoodrow Wilson, The Study of Administration, Washington, D.C., Public Affairs Press, 1955; originally published 1887 had run its course, tottering on stagnation and bankruptcy.Donald Devine, \\"American Culture and Public Administration,\\" Policy Studies Journal, December, 1982 Devine's major thesis has been that the progressive movement against the old Constitutional order had become so successful politically in both political parties over the past century that few Americans now understand their original government and how their Constitution provided the foundation for its historical success. This lack of understanding has produced a profound unease with how government works and explains why society has not responded positively to the changes, provoking a widespread demand for an alternative. There is a general agreement, Devine argues, that something is profoundly wrong and that something about the nation's greatness is being lost. For many, this has meant a turning toward the Constitution and the principles underlying it, which he argues is the only real alternative. Needless to say Devine's philosophy is controversial especially from the perspectives of the component elements of his synthesis, claiming either traditionalism or libertarianism cannot be harmonized, as they did concerning his fusionist mentor, Frank S. Meyer. Paleoconservative Samuel Francis argued that Devine's fusionism was an unsuccessful attempt to absorb an indivisible traditionalism into pluralist libertarianism.Samuel Francis, \\"(Con)fusionism on the Right\\" Chronicles, March 1, 2004 On the other hand, libertarian Nick Gillespie argued libertarian means inevitably lead to libertarian rather than traditionalist ends.Nick Gillespie, \\"Can This Marriage Be Saved?\\" as in Tim Cavanaugh, \\"Final Divorce Papers,\\" Reason, March 29, 2005 and Daniel McCarthy, \\"Low Tax Liberalism Redux,\\" Lew Rockwell.com, March 12, 2005 Meanwhile, the left claimed neither element had much validity.Dionne, 161 ff. While his philosophical synthesis and his governmental and political activism provoked substantial opposition from many sides, they also claimed some measure of public support.Brian Domitrovic, \\"Thinly-Veiled Social Darwinism?\\" Forbes.com https://www.forbes.com/sites/briandomitrovic/2012/04/17/thinly-veiled-social- darwinism-in-paul-ryans-budget-lets-check. ==Works== * The Attentive Public: Polyarchical Democracy, Chicago: Rand McNally, 1970 * The Political Culture of the United States: The Mass Influence On Regime Maintenance, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1972 * Does Freedom Work?

He is also a practicing Chiropractor in his home town of Nashville, MI. He was elected in 2010 to the Michigan House of Representatives, and served as Vice Chair of the House Health Policy Committee, and was a member of the Insurance Policy Committee and the House Military, Veterans' Affairs & Homeland Security Committee. ==Biography== Callton is the owner of Nashville Chiropractic Center. Prior to being elected to the State House, Callton served six years on the Barry County Commission. He also served as a member of the Nashville Village Council as well as the Maple Valley Board of Education. Callton earned a biology degree from Michigan State University in 1981; going on to serve in the U.S. Army from 1982 to 1985. After leaving the army, he went on to earn a Doctorate of Chiropractic from the National University of Health Sciences in 1989. In 2013 he won the Michigan Association of Chiropractors' Chiropractor of the Year award. ==Legislative Work== Medical Marijuana Representative Callton has worked on refining Michigan's Medical Marihuana Law, and has sponsored bills relating to patient safety. On January 26, 2012, Callton, along with Michigan's 5th Circuit Court Judge Amy McDowell and Medical Marihuana Activist Ken Bayer, held a discussion panel-style townhall in Hastings, MI, which was well attended. Callton also introduced HB 5580 of 2012, a bill to create and regulate \\"Provisioning Centers,\\" a form of Medical Marihuana Dispensary. This bill would put the power to authorize dispensaries into the hands of the local municipal or township governments, and allow for these \\"Provisioning Centers\\" to buy overage from registered patients, and allow for the resale to other qualified patients. Presidential Citizenship Verification Bill In 2011, Representative Callton sponsored a presidential eligibility bill to require the Secretary of State to verify that all presidential candidates meet the constitutional requirement of \\"Natural born\\" by presenting their birth certificate before being placed on the ballot. ==Controversy== In June 2012, while speaking on the House Floor in opposition to a bill package dealing with abortion, Representative Lisa Brown evoked her Jewish faith as a point of debate on the subject. She concluded with the comment, \\"Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but 'no' means 'no.'\\" Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, R-Midland, determined Brown's comments violated the decorum of the House and barred her from speaking for a one-day period. On June 14, the Detroit News quoted Callton's take on Brown's comments. \\"What she said was offensive ... It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women. I would not say that in mixed company,\\" he said. \\"It's just an extremely offensive statement.\\" Callton, who is also Jewish, said he consulted his rabbi and believes Brown's interpretation of the Talmud as it relates to abortion is incorrect. The bill that prompted Brown's comments was passed by a vote of 70-39 with one representative not voting. ==References * Campaign Website Category:1958 births Category:Members of the Michigan House of Representatives Category:Living people Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:People from Barry County, Michigan Category:Michigan Republicans Category:American chiropractors Category:21st-century American politicians Category:National University of Health Sciences alumni ","title":"Mike Callton"},{"id":"35184223","text":"A Bahamas Executive Entity, sometimes referred to simply as an Executive Entity, is designed to encapsulate powers currently existing in wealth management and estate planning structures within a new form of legal entity.

Since its heyday in the 1930s, the organization has shrunk significantly, to the point that it is no longer known whether or not it still exists. ==History== Both the JOUAM and the Daughters of America are descended from the Order of United American Mechanics, founded in 1845. The Junior Order of United American Mechanics, as its name suggests, was meant to be the youth affiliate of the Order. The OUAM founded a ladies auxiliary, the Daughters of Liberty in the 1870s. The JOUAM split from the OUAM in 1885.Stevens, Albert Clark, 1854- The Cyclop√¶dia of Fraternities: A Compilation of Existing Authentic Information and the Results of Original Investigation as to More than Six Hundred Secret Societies in the United States (New York: Hamilton Printing and Publishing Company), 1899, p. 316. When the JOUAM decided to form a Daughters of Liberty group in 1891, the older Order objected. The Daughters of America were formed instead. The \\"National Council, Daughters of American\\" was chartered in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Though it was always considered the auxiliary of JOUAM, it was only officially recognized in 1926.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1980, p. 82.

While the larger organization may no longer exist in its previous forms, online records of tax returns for the Daughters of America National Council dating to as recently as 2014 exist. == Organization and membership == The Daughters of America was organized on three levels. Local groups were called Councils, state groups were called State Councils, and the overall structure was called the National Council. Its headquarters was located in Harrisburg, Ohio in 1979.Schmidt, pp. 83-84. In 1923 there were 1,000 local Councils with slightly more than 115,000 members in 32 states.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.102 By 1930 the organization reported having over 160,000 members in 33 states. Its membership numbers were reduced to about 19,000 in 26 states by 1978.Schmidt, p. 83. Originally, the order was open to white American women over 16, as well as members of the JOUAM. Later, in a pamphlet described as \\"recent\\" in 1979, the order was described as open to \\"PATRIOTIC, WHITE MALE AND FEMALE CITIZENS OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER, WHO BELIEVE IN A SUPREME BEING AS THE CREATOR AND PRESERVER of the Universe and who favor the upholding the American Public School System and the reading of the Holy Bible in the schools thereof, must be opposed to the union of Church and State; must be literate and capable of giving all the secret signs and words of the Order, or of explaining them if unable to give them by reason of some physical misfortune or defect.\\"Schmidt, p. 83. Emphasis in original. The age requirement for membership was lowered to 14 by this time. == Rituals and secrecy == The Daughters had a ritual which it still was very serious about keeping secret as late as 1970. They were also strict about not discussing its business outside the Council rooms.Schmidt, p. 83. == Philanthropy and benefits == In 1907 the Daughters of America created a Funeral Benefit Department.Preuss p.101 The organization also operated a home for the elderly in Tiffin, Ohio. Those members wishing to reside there had two options: turn over all their income and properties to the home or join a \\"contributing plan\\" which required a monthly fee of $275. Any member 62 or older who had been a member of the order for at least fifteen years was eligible to stay at the home.Schmidt, p. 83. Instead of an orphanage, the Daughters of America created an early form of foster care called the \\"Helping Hands System\\". A manager would find suitable homes for the children and a stipend for their support was paid out of the funds of the department, raised by voluntary contributions from the local branches.Preuss pp.101-2 By the 1970s this had evolved into a financial aid toward the education of children under 18 in the event of the members death.Schmidt, p. 83.

Rooneys (or formally the James P. Rooneys) were an independent semi- professional American football team, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The team was founded by Art Rooney, who is best known for being the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, and this team is considered to be the unofficial beginnings of the modern-day Steelers. The team played at Exposition Park and reportedly had up to 12,000 people in the stands at times. ==History== The team was founded in 1921 as Hope-Harvey. The team's name was based on two items. The first was a fire station, located in the city's Hope ward, where the team would dress and shower for home games. The second item was based on Dr. Walter Harvey, the physician who tended to injured players. According to Art Rooney, Dr. Walter Harvey never charged the team or players for his services. The team‚Äôs uniforms were handmade by the players or members of their families so each one was sewn differently. Rooney not only served the team as a player-coach, but also recruited players from the neighborhoods and local colleges. His brothers, Dan Rooney Jr. (uncle of longtime Steelers chairman Dan M. Rooney) and James P. Rooney, played on the team in its early years, the only time the three were players together on the same football team. After a few years of play, the team was sponsored by \\"Loeffler's Electronic Store\\", who renamed the team after one of its best selling products, the Majestic radio. Hence the team became known as the Majestic Radios. The team's affiliation with Loeffler's ended prior to the team's 1931 season. When James decided to run for the Pennsylvania General Assembly, Art renamed the team the \\"J.P. Rooneys\\" as a way to promote his brother's campaign. James Rooney would go on to win the election easily. Rooney's semi-professional teams met a fair amount of success, including at least two Western Pennsylvania Senior Independent Football Conference titles in the early 1930s. In 1933, as Pennsylvania's blue laws were about to be repealed, Rooney applied for and received a franchise in the National Football League. The Rooneys morphed into the Pittsburgh Pirates, and were renamed the Steelers in 1940. ==Legacy== The team marked the very beginning of Art J. Rooney‚Äôs longstanding career in professional football. Art Rooney also became one of the biggest stars in the Pittsburgh sandlot football circuit as the team's quarterback. Finally, this period stands as the only time when Art Rooney managed, coached and played on a team. Several of the Rooneys players would go on to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NFL in 1933, such as Mose Kelsch and Ray Kemp.. In 2003 a sculpture of the Hope-Harvey team, consisting of 23 signed and numbered figures, each cold cast in nickel resin, were created by Kathy Rooney, the youngest daughter of the team's ball boy, Vince Rooney, and her husband, Ray Sokolowski. The couple made an original sculpture and 30 copies, which sold from $20,000 to $25,000 a piece. ==References== Category:1921 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1932 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:Pittsburgh Steelers Category:History of Pennsylvania Category:Defunct American football teams in Pennsylvania ","title":"J.P.

The series is recorded at different universities around the country, the contestants all coming from the university in which the recording takes place. One teams consists of three students and the other of three lecturers (known as the \\"Dons\\") who teach the subjects the students are studying. ==Format== The show consists of several rounds which are as follows: * The General Knowledge Round: Each team are asked general knowledge questions in turn, which they are allowed to confer on. If they get the question right, they score two points. If they get it wrong the question is thrown over to the other team for a bonus point. * Specialist Subject Round 1: The first of three specialist subject rounds. The rounds are between one student and the Don who teaches them. The questions are on the academic subject that the student is learning and the Don teaches. The scoring is asymmetric in favour of the student. Correct answers score two points. If a Don gets a question wrong it can go over for a bonus point to the student, but if a student gets a question wrong no bonus is given. * The List Round: Each team is given 30 seconds to list as many things in a given category (time begins after Punt finishes reading the question). One point is given for each correct answer (indicated by a \\"ping\\" sound effect). If eight correct answers are given in the time limit, a ninth bonus point is awarded. * Specialist Subject Round 2: The second specialist subject round. Follows the same format as the first. * Highbrow Lowbrow: Referred to by some as the show's \\"Signature round\\", here each contestant is given a short clue to a question and are then asked if they want to answer a highbrow or a lowbrow question based on the clue. The students score two points if they get the highbrow question right or one point if they get the lowbrow question right. For the Dons, it is the other way around (one point for highbrow, two points for lowbrow). When the contestant chooses the question, their academic rival has to answer the question not chosen. * Specialist Subject Round 3: The third and final specialist subject round. Follows the same format as the others. * The Quick Fire Round: The final general knowledge \\"bell and buzzer\\" round (the students have a bell, the Dons have a buzzer). Correct answers score one point. Incorrect interruptions lose one point. Questions are not thrown over to the other side. ==Reception== Reviews for The 3rd Degree have been mixed. Iain Weaver from UKGameshows gave a positive review of the series, saying: \\"We're not tremendously upset by the way the teachers went through the series unbeaten, they are university lecturers, and university lecturers are meant to know an awful lot. We also liked the way Steve Punt kept the programme flowing at a decent pace, adding jokes and asides, and keeping proceedings moving along most enjoyably. He's probably helped by the audience at the student bar, who have doubtlessly taken this opportunity to have their one pint of something for the week. If there's one slight criticism we'd make, it's that the Highbrow Lowbrow round is a bit of a block in the middle of the programme. We might prefer to split the round into two parts, perhaps shifting the first immediately before the lists round. That would add a little bit more variety, and make the programme a little less imposing. That's just a minor criticism: most of what The 3rd Degree does, it does well. Given that it replaced the venerable Quote... Unquote, it didn't have a high bar, but we can see this programme running for a fair few years.\\" Elisabeth Mahoney was negative in her summing up writing in The Guardian: \\"There are lots of rather lukewarm, predictable asides like this between rounds that rarely move beyond mildly distracting. You can imagine that on paper, this looked like a really swell idea: the reality on-air lacks pace and excitement, and you know the dons will win. It's a bit foggy in places, too, with a mysterious regime of bonus points available at some times and not others, and it can be hard to remember, by first name, who is on which side of the academic divide... There are a few amusing moments like this, but ultimately it's all a bit soulless and you don't really care who wins. Derek Smith in The Stage gave a mixed review saying the show was: \\"A kind of dysfunctional radio version of University Challenge. My question would be - what's the point? Admittedly, it's quite lively, but only vaguely funny, and hardly dynamic. Third-class degree, more like.\\" Awards In 2015 The 3rd Degree was nominated for the Rose d'Or in the \\"Radio Game Show\\" category. ==Episodes== Series 1 {  width=\\"80%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !

The west and southwest of the plateau region borders the east, southeast of the Painted Desert, where the Puerco River enters the desert, flowing southwest from New Mexico then meeting the Little Colorado River which flows northwest through the Painted Desert-(light tan & arc-shaped), to the Colorado River (at the northeast of the Grand Canyon). The Puerco River is the plateau's border on the south and southeast; at the northwest, the Black Mesa is the northwest border, and the north of the Defiance Plateau is bounded by the south of the Chinle Valley, where Chinle Creek flows north to meet the San Juan River in southeast Utah. Map of Little Colorado River watershed. (shows approximate location of Painted Desert and to the northeast, Defiance Plateau) The north terminus region of the Defiance Plateau contains three canyons, with watercourses flowing due-west, as headwaters of Chinle Creek. The canyons are the Canyon de Chelly National Monument; two other canyons are southwest, part of the five canyon system, Little White House and Three Turkey Canyons. The Defiance Plateau is part of the Navajo Nation. At the plateau's southeast, on Black Creek lies the site of Window Rock, Arizona, the Navajo Nation capitol. The highpoint of the plateau is Fluted Rock, southwest of Sawmill, Arizona, .Arizona Road & Recreation Atlas, p. 71. ==Description== Regional area surrounding the Defiance Plateau/Defiance Uplift. The Defiance Plateau is the central area of an uplifted region. To the north/northeast are the Lukachukai Mountains, part of the Defiance Plateau border; they form a southeast section of Chinle Valley's border. South of the Lukachukais is the rest of the east border of the Defiance Plateau, the Chuska Mountains; the Chuskas trend northwest in the north; at the plateaus east, the Chuskas trend more southerly, and attached at the south is Manuelito Plateau, in New Mexico, the east border of the south-flowing Black Creek at the southeast perimeter region of the Defiance Plateau. South and southwest The south perimeter of the Defiance Plateau is bordered by the Puerco River, flowing southwest from the Continental Divide in northwest New Mexico. The Puerco intersects the Little Colorado River at the southeast edge of the Painted Desert, where the Little Colorado runs directly northwest (then due-north, and then back to northwest) to eventually meet the Colorado River. Numerous mesas trend from the northeast (west and southwest sides of the Black Mesa) as drainage basin perimeters feeding the Little Colorado. At the southwest of the Defiance Plateau, is Padre Mesa; north is Ganada Mesa, (Ganado, Arizona), and northeast of Grand Mesa is Oak Creek Mountain, where the plateau highpoint is located, Fluted Rock, 4-miArizona Road & Recreation Atlas, p. 71. southwest of Sawmill, Arizona. North and northwest The northwest of the Defiance Plateau merges into the southeast of the Black Mesa, (southeast-trending, the same trendline as the Painted Desert). Black Mesa is also the west border of Chinle Valley, where the south-center, and southeast of the valley becomes part of the north perimeter of the plateau. Northeast and east are the mountain ranges that going southward, become the east parts of the Defiance Plateau. The Carrizo Mountains stand alone northeast; the Lukachukai Mountains are connected to the north Chuskas, and the extensive Chuska Mountains are attached to the Defiance Plateau at the east, with headwaters flowing west, or northwest into Canyon de Chelly or southeast Chinle Valley. In the south Chuskas, the Black Creek, and Red Lake, at the Red Valley region, southeast of Sawmill, form the final southeast perimeter region of the Defiance Plateau. Plateau center region The center region is near Sawmill, Arizona. Beautiful Valley to the northwest contains Nazlini Wash, where the wash is a southwest-tributary to the due-north flowing Chinle Creek system. The watershed origins also come from the southwest near Ganado, closer to the southwest Defiance Plateau perimeter. At Sawmill, northeast of Ganado is Bonito Canyon a northwest tributary to south-flowing Black Creek. The water divide separating the Chinle Creek watershed, (southeast, with Canyon de Chelly), is 3-miArizona DeLorme Atlas, p. 35. north-northeast of Sawmill. ==Access to the region== US 191 traverses mesas on the west perimeter of the Defiance Plateau, from Interstate 40 on the south and southeast plateau perimeter, following the course of the Puerco River from New Mexico. At the plateaus southeast, IR-12-(BIA-12) traverses north from I-40 to follow the Black Creek rivercourse, in Arizona. At the north, IR-12 meets Red Lake (Arizona - New Mexico) and Navajo, NM in Red Valley; IR-12 then traverses northeast, intersecting with New Mexico Road 134 through the Chuska Mountains, turning east to meet U.S. 491. IR-12, exits from NM 134 going north then northeast following the west flank of the Chuskas to meet US 191 north of Canyon de Chelly in the Chinle Valley-(at Lukachukai Creek, eventually reaching Round Rock, Arizona). The center-south of the Defiance Plateau is traversed east-west by Arizona State Route 264. Window Rock is at the southeast, on Black Creek, (southern Chuskas, Manuelito Plateau); Ganado, Arizona is in the center-southwest plateau region, where the mesas trend northwesterly along the northeast perimeter of the Painted Desert. The west terminus of AZ 264 is Tuba City, Arizona adjacent U.S. 89.

Son of Ivan-Theodore Rudnytzky ‚Äì a lawyer, UGA centurion, November rebellion (Lystopadovyj zryv) co-organizer (1918) and ZUNR military attach√© ‚Äì and Yulia Rudnytzka from the Luzhnytzky family. Leonid Rudnytzky belongs to those scholars who grew up among the Ukrainian emigration in American and German environments. Sometimes he would say, \\"I am an American scholar. Life made me so... The fate of Ukrainians in the diaspora was not easy at the beginning. Persecution, inadaptability to a new life, ignorance of the language and financial problems made life harder. ‚ÄúI saw and experienced it with many people who were close to me\\" - Rudnytzky would recall later. But there was some special consciousness in the immigrants‚Äô minds ‚Äì at any cost to pass the test of endurance and to stand on their own two feet. The important fact is that those people emigrated for political reasons. As time passed one could not stop admiring their spiritual purposefulness, sacrificial devotion to national affairs and high culture. There is no doubt that life conditions certainly contributed to the development of Rudnyzky‚Äôs tempered character as an individual and a scholar. == Biographical information == During the Second World War, in 1944, the Rudnytzky family moved to Germany. In 1951, at the age of 16 he lost his father and the following year moved to the United States with his mother. In 1958, got his undergraduate degree at La Salle College in Philadelphia. In 1960, earned an MA in Germanic Philology at University of Pennsylvania. And in 1965 he finished and defended his doctoral dissertation \\"Franko‚Äôs translations of German literature\\" at the Ukrainian Free University in Munich. In 1959 \\\\ 1960, taught at La Salle College (later University). Having started as an ordinary professor of Germanic and later Slavic Studies and Comparative Literature, he soon became ‚ÄúHabilitatio‚Äù Professor. In 1988‚Äì98 Rudnytzky taught at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and the Ukrainian Catholic University in Rome. Later, he was chosen to be the Director of the UCU (Ukrainian Catholic University) branch in Philadelphia. At the same time he became the Director of the Central and East European Studies Master‚Äôs Program at La Salle University. 1985‚Äì1986, 1989‚Äì1990, Chairman of the International Ivan Franko Society in the U.S. 1992‚Äì2006 ‚Äì President of the World Council of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. For a long period of time Prof. Rudnytzky held the position of Dean of the Philology Department and was a member of the faculty of the Ukrainian Free University in Munich. Between 1998 and 2004 he was its Rector. In 1994, he became a foreign scholar of NANU. (National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). From 2004 and to the present day (2011) he is President of the \\"Saint Sophia\\" Religious Association of the Ukrainian Catholics in America. == Activities in the Shevchenko Scientific Society (NTSh) == For more than 40 years Leonid Rudnytzky has been an active member of the Shevchenko Scientific Society. With his worthy scholarly and organizational work, he is one of the few foreign NTSh members who have contributed to its restoration in the native lands of Ukraine. He always keeps the Society in the spirit of national education and culture. It is worth mentioning Rudnytzky‚Äôs great attention to the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv. From the first days of its restoration in Ukraine and to this day Professor Rudnytzky is always in touch with the Presidium, Research and Publications Division of the Society. 1992 to 2006 ‚Äì Leonid Rudnytzky was the President of the World Council of Shevchenko Scientific Society. == Scholarly work == Leonid Rudnytzky‚Äôs scholarly work is focused on the following fields: the literary studies (Comparative literature, Ukrainian literature), language and translation, history, church, culture, biographical studies, theater studies and ethnological (ethical, moral and psychological-didactic) issues of civil society. He is also strongly involved in constant editorial, media, social and cultural work. One of the main scientific interests of Rudnytzky is the history of the world‚Äôs writing and general literature. Literature in scholar‚Äôs biography comes first. He sees it as a collection of written works of people and art embodied in words that reflect the reality in artistic images...\\" According to Rudnytzky‚Äôs interpretation, the study of literature is divided into scientific and artistic sections, designed primarily to meet intellectual and aesthetic needs. Both literatures are in the field of interest of the scholar. Especially close to Rudnytzky are the reflections on the nature of Ukrainian literature. He stresses the exceptional character of this literature, especially as a rarity and aesthetic phenomenon. In regards to German literature, the attention in Rudnytzky‚Äôs work is primarily focused on the analysis of the work of the 18th‚Äì19th century writers. This focus is not of a special interest. Rudnytzky is not concerned about going into depth in the works of German writers, but rather its path of influence on Slavic literature and Slavic reality, especially Ukrainian. His literary focus is divided between, on the one hand German writers of the 18th‚Äì19th centuries, such as H.-E. Lessing, J.-W. Goethe, G. Kleist, H. Heine, H. Keller, F. Mayer, D. Liliencron and others. On the other hand are Ukrainian writers headed by Ivan Franko. Rudnytzky evaluates Ukrainian writers from the perspective of Franko. Rudnytzky indicates the influence of German authors on the work of Franko, and through him to the development of Ukrainian literature. Among Rudnytzky‚Äôs literary interests his academic works related to theater studies and drama should be mentioned. His interest in research began while reviewing plays. His first publication was the article \\"Mazepa on the American scene.\\" Another side of academic interest of Rudnytzky is language and linguistics. He promotes the Ukrainian language through the re-edition of dictionaries. In 1992 within the framework of NTSh \\"The Dictionary of Synonyms of the Ukrainian Language\\" by A. Bagmet was published. In the context of his linguistic interest it is worth mentioning his work as a translator. He not only translates from Ukrainian to English, but also vice versa. Not only academic but also literary works are in his field of translation interest. By translating literary works he continues the implementation of Franko‚Äôs metaphor of translation as \\"a bridge of unity between nations.\\" Rudnytzky (together with Y. Tkach) translated \\"The Cathedral\\" by Oles‚Äô Honchar. A large part of Rudnytzky‚Äôs academic research concerns historical issues. His field of interest covers ancient and modern world, and especially the contemporary era. He asks the question of the development of history as a subject and the role of the historian in it. He regards history as ‚Äúthe most important humanist science\\" because it chronologically explores the development of human society. The issue of historical and cultural studies inevitably arise in Rudnytzky‚Äôs interest in the Ukrainian Catholic Church and other churches. It is worth mentioning the report on the status of churches and religions in the USSR which he delivered for the U.S. Congress in 1986. Another important part of his academic interest is the history of the Ukrainian Catholic Church and lay movement. == Creative works == Oleg Kupchinsky divided Rudnytzky‚Äôs creative activity into two areas: teaching and scholarly. Social and socio-cultural work are a very important part of his life also. As a teacher and lecturer Rudnytzky is popular and respected by the faculty and students. His warm relationship with students and the ability to make witty jokes makes him not only a teacher but a friend, father and mentor. ==Awards == * ¬´Lindback Award for distinguished teaching¬ª for teaching at La Salle University in Philadelphia (USA ‚Äì 1966) * Ivan Franko Literary Prize of the Union of Writers of Ukraine for research in Franko studies.

He was convicted in 1955, but the sentence was overturned on appeal due to procedural mistakes by the prosecution. He was retried and convicted again in 1958. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he specifically advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills.Daniel Levin, \\"Smith Act,\\" in Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties, vol. 1 (Routledge, 2006), 1488, available online, accessed June 13, 2012 Scales appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. He contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. Scales v. United States, Oyez, retrieved March 20, 2012. On June 5, 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld the conviction of Scales, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was constitutional because it required prosecutors to prove that there was direct advocacy of violence and that the membership was substantial and active, not passive or technical.Willis, Clyde, Student's guide to landmark congressional laws on the First Amendment, Greenwood, 2002, p 47, .

United States, 367 U.S. 290 (1961), was a 1961 United States Supreme Court case that reversed the felony conviction of a lower-echelon official of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). ==Background== John Francis Noto of Buffalo, New York, was the chairman of the CPUSA for upstate New York. According to officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Noto \\"went underground\\" in 1951. A grand jury issued a secret indictment for his arrest in November 1954 and he was taken into custody on August 31, 1955New York Times: \\"Red Leader Seized Upstate,\\" September 1, 1955, accessed June 19, 2012; New York Times: \\"Smith Act Case First in State,\\" September 18, 1955, accessed June 19, 2012. Noto was 37 years old at the time of his trial. He was a native of Ridgeway, Pennsylvania. The government claimed that he had been active in the Party since 1934, was the CPUSA's chairman for Erie County (Buffalo), a leader of the Young Communist League in the 1940s, and on the Party's payroll from 1946 to 1950. He was convicted of a felony in federal District Court in Rochester in 1956 under the membership clause of the Smith Act, which made membership in an organization that advocates the violent overthrow of the United States government a felony. He was sentenced to five years in prison. He challenged the constitutionality of that clause on appeal. The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction on December 31, 1958, and with respect to the membership clause said: \\"Clearly this is not a prosecution of membership per se but of membership with knowledge and criminal intent.\\"New York Times: \\"Red's Conviction Upheld by Court,\\" January 1, 1959, accessed June 19, 2012 ==Decision== The Supreme Court case reversed Noto's conviction on June 5, 1961, in a unanimous decision, finding that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to demonstrate that the Party was advocating action to cause the forcible overthrow of the government.Milton Konvitz, \\"Noto v. United States\\", in The Oxford companion to the Supreme Court of the United States (Oxford University Press, 2005), 697 Justice Harlan wrote:Justia: Noto v. United States (1961), accessed June 19, 2012 Justices Black and Douglas wrote concurring opinions that argued that the Court should have gone further and ruled that the membership clause of the Smith Act was unconstitutional. Douglas wrote that \\"the utterances, attitudes, and associations in this case ... are, in my view, wholly protected by the First Amendment, and not subject to inquiry, examination, or prosecution by the Federal Government.\\" Black characterized Harlan's review of the inadequacy of the trial testimony sarcastically: On the same day, the Court upheld a provision of the Internal Security Act of 1950 that required \\"Communist action\\" organizations to register with the government, which subjected their members to a variety of restrictions. Observers assessed the Court's sustaining the membership clause of the Smith Act in that light. Anthony Lewis wrote in the New York Times: \\"The court's opinions were carefully limited and did not give the government a blank check in applying the two statutes. Nevertheless, the decisions were substantial victories for the governmentthe most important legal victories it has had in the internal security field in many years.\\"New York Times: Anthony Lewis, \\"\\"High Court Puts Curb on U.S. Reds in 2 Major Cases,\\" June 6, 1961, accessed June 19, 2012.

Built around 1859 as the headquarters of a forced labor camp, the house was restored between 2003 and 2008 and is now a part of Arkansas State University as a Heritage site museum. ==History== The plantation was established in 1831 by Joel Johnson, from a prominent planter family in Scott County, Kentucky. He arrived with 23 enslaved people and set up a forced labor camp to produce cotton, an endeavor that made him one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the state. Joel Johnson died in 1846, leaving the plantation's ownership in legal dispute. In 1857, his son Lycurgus Johnson, a successful operator of his own forced labor camp, acquired the title to Lakeport. He also took over the enslavement of 88 people. By 1850, he had 2,850 acres of land and had enslaved 95 people. The plantation's mansion was built around 1859Matthew D. Therrell and David W. Stahle, \\"Tree-Ring Dating of An Arkansas Antebellum Plantation House,\\" Tree-Ring Research 68(2012): 59-67Thomas A. DeBlack, A Garden in the Wilderness: The Johnsons and the Making of Lakeport Plantation (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Arkansas, 1995). in the Greek Revival architectural style. By 1860, Johnson had enslaved more than 155 people, and forced them to work some 4,000 acres of land at Lakeport and his other Arkansas properties. Records show that most of the enslaved people were field hands, but some were masons, house-hold servants, and carpenters. Plantation life was exhausting for those forced to work it; many worked six days a week with only one day off, typically Sunday. The plantation was highly profitable as cotton prices increased with European demand, though the Civil War took a toll on Johnson's fortunes. Confederate forces burned 158 bales of the plantation's cotton in 1862 to prevent its capture by Union forces. By 1864, tax records show, the number of people enslaved at Lakeport had declined to 24, as many people left after the Emancipation Proclamation freed them. The end of the Civil War resulted in the emancipation of the remaining enslaved people. However, while they obtained their freedom, they still held no rights or stature in society. The Freedmen's Bureau was created to help freedmen, thus the transition into sharecropping and tenant farmers. Lycurgus worked closely with the Bureau and negotiated wages for the no-longer-enslaved people to labor on his plantation and continue to grow cotton. Within a few years, many of the freedmen worked for Johnson either as paid laborers or as sharecroppers, as other jobs were few in the agricultural delta. He became well known in the county because he managed to continue to profit despite the war and subsequent flooding and economic depression. Lakeport was among the leading cotton producers in Chicot County in 1870. The plantation went through several changes after Lycurgus Johnson died on August 1, 1876, as a result of complications from a gastrointestinal disorder. His wife Lydia owned it until she died in December 1898, when it passed to the youngest son, Victor Johnson. It remained in the Johnson family until 1927 when Victor sold it to the Sam Epstein family. In 1974 the plantation was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2001, the plantation was donated by the Sam Epstein Angel family to Arkansas State University. Restoration of the plantation began in 2003 and finished in 2007. Some of the restored parts were the doors, the floorcloth, mantel, the rose window in the attic and the smokehouse in the back of the property. In 2007, it opened as a public museum. Today, the plantation itself is no longer active, as it has become a museum, but it is surrounded by cotton fields that are harvested every year. ==See also== *List of plantations in the United States *National Register of Historic Places listings in Chicot County, Arkansas ==References * Plantation website Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Greek Revival houses in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Houses in Chicot County, Arkansas Category:Plantation houses in Arkansas Category:Museums in Chicot County, Arkansas Category:Historic house museums in Arkansas Category:Arkansas State University Category:University museums in Arkansas Category:Cotton plantations in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Chicot County, Arkansas Category:Lake Village, Arkansas Category:1850s establishments in Arkansas ","title":"Lakeport Plantation"},{"id":"35184612","text":"Baker & McKenzie Taher Helmy is the Founder and Senior Partner of the Egyptian Law Firm Helmy, Hamza & Partners and Senior Partner of the International Law Firm of Baker & McKenzie.

They reorganized the unit as The Blue Devils, taking the name from the V.F.W.'s color (blue) and a local landmark, Mt. Diablo (devil). In its first season, the group performed as an all-boy drum corps with an all-girl drill team. In 1958, the Blue Devils added glockenspiels, becoming a drum and bell corps, while the girls became a separate a baton twirling troupe, the Majorettes. In 1961, the Blue Devils added a flag section to the unit that was then competing in the state's Junior division. Jerry Seawright succeeded Tony Odello as corps manager in 1964. In 1968, the drum and bell corps moved into Senior Division competition, becoming the Blue Devils \\"A\\" corps, and a new Blue Devils \\"B\\" Junior corps was begun. With all units of the Blue Devils organization enjoying success, the decision was made to transform the \\"A\\" drum and bell corps into a drum and bugle corps (D&B;).

In 2009, The Concord Blue Devils went undefeated and won their 13th World Championship with a record score (for the corps) of 99.05. This was also the first time an organization won both World and Open Class Championships with the Blue Devils B also going undefeated and winning their 1st World Championship. In 2010, The Concord Blue Devils and Blue Devils B repeated their 2009 feat by once again winning the World and Open Class championships and the A corps completing back-to-back undefeated seasons, a first in DCI history. The B corps only lost one show in 2010. In 2011, Blue Devils \\"B\\" repeated for a third straight year as Open Class World Champions, narrowly beating the Oregon Crusaders. The Crusaders beat BDB only days before the finals, providing their only loss of the season. In a changed format that year, Blue Devils \\"B\\" went on to place 19th at the World Class semifinals, beating out five World Class Corps (Jersey Surf, Cascades, Teal Sound, Mandarins, and Pioneer). Note A: The 1999 Precision West show counted only as an exhibition show due to the city losing power halfway through the Blue Devils performance after the Santa Clara Vanguard had performed first. This show is unofficially referred to as the \\"Lights Out Show\\" and is considered by some to be one of the loudest and longest standing ovations in DCI history, given as a result of the members not stopping their performance when the lights went out. The power failed about a minute into the ballad section of the show, and the members continued to play and march to the end of the show in very dim and fading light. Many of the members in the corps feel that the \\"Lights Out Show\\" was a turning point for them, and that it had bonded the corps, eventually leading them to winning their 10th DCI World Championship. Note B: The Blue Devils B-Corps won the DCI Open-Class Championship title for three consecutive years: 2009, 2010, and 2011, giving the organization another championship \\"Three-peat\\", the first for one of the organizations' drum corps.

The premiere took place on 20 April 1967 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. The music, taken from the opera Carmen by Georges Bizet and arranged for strings and percussion, is not a 19th-century pastiche but rather \\"a creative meeting of the minds,\\" as Shchedrin put it, with Bizet's melodies reclothed in a variety of fresh instrumental colors (including the frequent use of percussion), set to new rhythms and often phrased with a great deal of sly wit. Initially banned by the Soviet hierarchy as \\"disrespectful\\" to the opera for precisely these qualities, the ballet has since become Shchedrin's best-known work and has remained popular in the West for what reviewer James Sanderson calls \\"an iconoclastic but highly entertaining retelling of Bizet's opera.\\"Sanderson, allmusic.com. ==Structure== The ballet is in one act containing 13 dance numbers: * I. Introduction: Andante assai * II. Dance: Allegro * III. First Intermezzo: Allegro moderato - Andante moderato - (attacca) * IV. Changing of the Guard: Moderato * V. Carmen's Entrance and Haba√±era: Allegro moderato - Quasi andante * VI. Scene: Allegro moderato - Tempo precedente - Andante assai * VII. Second Intermezzo: Larghetto * VIII. Bolero: Allegro vivo * IX. Torero: Moderato con stoltezza * X. Torero and Carmen: Lento - Tempo I * XI. Adagio: Andante moderato - Adagio * XII. Fortune-Telling: Andantino - Andante assai * XIII. Finale: Allegro - Tempo precedente - Andante assai ==Instrumentation== A standard string orchestra of violins, violas, cellos, double basses is augmented by a percussion battery of one timpanist and four members, who play the following: Player 1: marimba, vibraphone, castanets, three cowbells, four bongos, tubular bells, snare drum, guiro Player 2: vibraphone, marimba, snare drum, tambourine, two woodblocks, claves, triangle, guiro Player 3: glockenspiel, crotales, maracas, whip, snare drum, choclo, guiro, three temple blocks, bass drum, tam-tam, snare drum, triangle Player 4: cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, hi-hat, triangle, tambourine, five tom-toms Two factors influenced Shchedrin in choosing this instrumentation. The first, he said in an interview with BBC Music Magazine, was that, \\"to be [as] totally far [as possible]\\" from Bizet's scoring for the opera, he wanted an ensemble \\"without brass and woodwind... that gave me many possibilities\\" for timbral variety. The second was the high level of string and percussion players then available in the Bolshoi orchestra.Duchen, BBC Music Magazine. ==Composition== Rodion Shchedrin with his wife, Maya Plisetskaya, in 2009. He wrote Carmen Suite for Plisetskaya The idea for Carmen Suite originated with Shchedrin's wife, Bolshoi Theatre ballerina Maya Plisetskaya. In 1964, she asked composer Dmitri Shostakovich to compose a ballet on the story of Carmen, since, Shchedrin said, they were both on good terms with him. Shostakovich \\"gently but firmly refused,\\" Plisetskaya remembers. \\"I'm afraid of Bizet,\\" he told her half- jokingly. \\"Everyone is so used to the opera that whatever you write, you'll disappoint them.\\" He suggested that perhaps Shchedrin could \\"come up with something special\\" to fulfill her request. Instead, she went to Aram Khachaturian, the composer of the ballets Gayane and Spartacus, but \\"things never went beyond talking.\\"Maya, 269-70. Shchedrin added that Khachaturian told Plisetskaya, \\"Why you need me? You have a composer at home, ask him!\\" It was then, he said, that she asked him to write the music. In late 1966, the Ballet Nacional de Cuba stopped in Moscow during its Soviet tour. Plisetskaya's mother attended its performances and encouraged her to go. Eventually, Plisetskaya approached the company's choreographer, Alberto Alonso and told him of her desire for a Carmen ballet.Ballet Nacional de Cuba website.Maya, 270. Alonso developed the libretto and worked with Ballet Nacional dancers on the choreography, then flew to Moscow to teach the work to Plisetskaya. Shchedrin watched her initial rehearsals with Alonso and agreed to write music for the ballet.balletbag.com notes. However, as much as he struggled to write an original score for this project, Shchedrin found he could not extricate the story from the music that French composer Georges Bizet wrote for his opera of the same name, a score Shchedrin called \\"fantastic, one of the best in the whole history of music.\\" Eventually, Shchedrin decided to exploit this connection in what he called \\"a creative meeting of the minds.\\"Armstrong, BBC Music. With Shostakovich's words in mind, Shchedrin said, \\"I had to combine ... something fresh ... with these famous melodies.\\" From this motive came the idea to use just strings and percussion for the instrumentation \\"because then it is a totally modern combination.\\" His intent was to give homage to what Bizet had done and acknowledge the universality of his music in telling the story of Carmen while adding his own ideas to the work. In this way, Andrew Lindemann Malone writes in his description of the ballet, Shchedrin positioned him on a creative middle ground, \\"making himself if not an equal partner at least something above the level of arranger.\\"Malone, allmusic.com work description. Toward this end, Shchedrin set Bizet's music with a number of clever and unexpected rhythmic twists and subtler changes in notes and chords. This gives the impression of simultaneously recognizing something familiar and being surprised in hearing something slightly distorted about it. Some melodies are \\"combined for 'found' counterpoint,\\" Malone writes, others interrupted and still more left unaccompanied where Shchedrin assumes the listener knows both music and story all too well. An instance of the last mentioned, Malone writes, is \\"when a big whipped-up climax in the Torero scene leads to nothing but the lowest percussion, pumping quietly, merrily, and obliviously along.\\" He also adds a number of humorous touches, such as the off-color use of the \\"Farandole\\" from Bizet's incidental music to L'Arl√©sienne and the sudden, unexpected hesitations in the Toreador Song. None of these changes obfuscate either the general melodic curves of Bizet's music--all the familiar tunes are easily recognizable--or the intricacies of the plot. Shchedrin's orchestration proved equally unexpected and creative. Eschewing the full orchestra of Bizet for one of strings and an enlarged percussion section, he \\"boldly overhauled\\" the orchestral sound, as Sanderson phrases it, with a greatly widened timbrel range enhancing the sharpened rhythms and sudden hairpin turns in phrasing and mood. The Habanera, Malone says, is introduced \\"in a bouncy duet\\" for vibraphone and tympani, while various percussion instruments accentuate separate notes in the \\"Changing of the Guard\\" scene to \\"unexpectedly rattle\\" the melodic line.\\" The full extent of Shchedrin's emendations and their faithfulness to Bizet and the story, Malone writes, are both shown in the finale of the ballet: \\"melodies get twisted, thrown to exotic percussion, and otherwise trampled, but the resulting music, with its passionate climax and coda of distant bells and pizzicato strings, still has gravity and depth, due both to Bizet and to Shchedrin's interventions.\\" ==Roles== Carmen, a gypsy woman Don Jos√©, corporal of Dragoons Escamillo, a bullfighter (toreador) Z√∫√±iga, captain of Dragoons Fate Magistrate ==Synopsis== :Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills :Time: Around 1820 Alonso's scenario centers on Carmen, Don Jos√© and the bullfighter Escamillo. Carmen is a passionate, free- spirited woman in contrast to the temperamental and fickle Don Jos√©. Fate, a ballerina dressed in black and a representation of Carmen's alter ego, tells Carmen's fortune with a deck of cards. A fight with tobacco dealers leads to Carmen's arrest by Captain Z√∫√±iga. In jail, she seduces Don Jos√© and convinces him to release her. Carmen is subsequently caught in a love triangle between Don Jos√© and popular bullfighter Escamillo. Boris Messerer's sets included a mock bullring which symbolizes life, uniting the bullfight and Carmen's destiny in a sinister personage. Masked spectators and a uniformed judge represent society's disapproval for the unconventional behavior of Carmen and her lovers. Fate reappears in the final act playing the role of a bull and the three main characters meet in the arena. Carmen dances alternatively with Fate, Escamillo and Don Jos√© until she is stabbed. She dies caressing Don Jos√©'s face, revealing him as the assassin. ==Official ban== The Bolshoi premiered Carmen Suite in 1967 but the fact that Bizet's music was so well- known actually worked against its favor, at first. Soviet Minister of Culture Yekaterina Furtseva, was repelled by the modernist flavor given to the music and the sexual overtones of both the story and the title character. She banned the work immediately following its premiere as \\"insulting\\" to Bizet's masterpiece. Explaining this, Furtseva commented to Soviet media, \\"We cannot allow them to make a whore out of Carmen, the heroine of the Spanish people.\\" (Unfortunately for Furtseva, her words were taken as a joke among the Moscow public following the controversy.Dance, 205.) When she met privately at the Bolshoi with Plisetskaya and other members, Furtseva called Carmen Suite \\"a great failure,\\" the production \\"raw. Nothing but eroticism. The opera's music has been mutilated. The concept has to be rethought. I have grave doubts as to whether the ballet can be redone.\\"Maya, 276. Not long after the meeting with Furtseva, Shostakovich called the ministry about Carmen Suite. He told Furtseva that he considered the ballet both a masterly transcription and highly effective dance music. At this time, Shostakovich was First Secretary of the Composer's union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR); this made him effectively leader of that union. Even if it were not meant as an official call and regardless of his official position still being subservient to hers, the fact it was Shostakovich calling might have still carried some cachet.Fanning, 20. Because of this personal intervention, the ban was lifted.Armstrong, BBC Music; Maya, 276; Sanderson, allmusic.com. Plisetskaya confessed in her autobiography that without Shostakovich's help, the ban on Carmen Suite might have remained permanent.Maya, 276-7. Shostakovich's call did not end all official interference with the ballet, however. Carmen Suite had been planned for the Bolshoi's upcoming tour of Canada as part of Expo 67, scheduled to be held in Toronto. In fact, the Canadian impresario assisting with the Bolshoi on the tour, Nikolai Kudryavtsev, had specifically requested it and felt it would be highly appropriate.Maya, 277. Kudryavtsev, assured by the Ministry of Culture that Carmen Suite would be included, booked the Maple Leaf Gardens and began advertising Plisetskaya's appearance in it, expecting a full audience of 6,000. However, when he arrived in Moscow in July 1967 to sign contracts, he was told that Furtseva had seen the ballet and decided it would not be shown in Canada. The objection at that time appeared to be that Plisetskaya had danced in \\"very abbreviated black tights.\\"Ruud, 149. Two weeks later, Kudryavtsev, who was then in Vienna, was asked by the Soviets to a meeting at Furtseva's office in Moscow. The meeting lasted from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM and consisted mainly, as he recalled later to Canadian poet and diplomat Robert Ford, of \\"a running battle between Plisetskaya and Furtseva.\\"Ruud, 149-50. Furtseva told Plisetskaya that not only would Carmen Suite not be included but that she was to tell the foreign press that the work was not ready to be performed. When told this, Plisetskaya refused to go on tour and that if she were forced to do so, she would tell the foreign press the truth about Carmen Suite. At one point, Kudryavtsev remembered, Furtseva accused Shchedrin of plagiarism for claiming Carmen Suite \\"was his own work when 'everyone knew that it had been written by a French composer, Bizet.'\\" Plisetskaya demanded that Furtseva withdraw this charge or she would never dance again, either in the Soviet Union or abroad. Kudryavtsev told Ford that Furtseva said this was fine by her as Plisetskaya was too old to continue dancing anyway.Ruud, 150. Plisetskaya, in her version of the meeting, said that Furtseva \\"screeched\\" that Plisetskaya would be \\"a traitor to classical ballet\\" by leaving, to which she did not reply. As it turned out, Plisetskaya became seriously ill and could not go on the tour. Carmen Suite was not performed but the sets were shipped regardless.Maya, 279.Instead of Carmen Suite, the Bolshoi offered Don Quixote danced by Ekaterina Maximova. Only 2,500 people attended, which made the performance a financial disaster (Ruud, 150). With its sets still abroad, Carmen Suite could not be performed for the 50-year celebration of the October Revolution. Once they were returned, the Bolshoi was allowed to stage the ballet, which became popular with Moscow audiences. In 1968, Premier Alexei Kosygin saw and praised it. When a tour of Great Britain was scheduled for later that year and the British impresario requested Carmen Suite, the Ministry of Culture agreed.Maya, 280. ==Critical reactions== In the April 1969 issue of Gramophone, reviewer Edward Greenfield called Carmen Suite \\"A real curiosity\\" and, while \\"a skilful hotchpotch on popular themes [that] has its attractions,\\" it was \\"Not the sort of thing, then, that is going to endear itself to the US State Department\\"--a nod to the work's Soviet-Cuban roots and the Cold War climate prevailing at the time.Greenfield, gramophone.net. More recent commentators seem to have taken the ballet's tongue-in-cheekiness more in stride. In his review of the Kremlin Chamber Orchestra recording, Sanderson calls the ballet \\"an iconoclastic but highly entertaining retelling of Bizet's opera,\\" and John Armstrong, in his BBC Music review of the Mikhail Pletnev- Russian National Orchestra recording, writes that in Carmen Suite, \\"you get all the familiar tunes dressed up in a way Bizet would never have imagined, and with a sly grin and a twinkle in the eye.\\" The music is still not universally loved, though. In his review of the Pletnev recording, Raymond Tuttle calls Shchedrin's efforts \\"a sort of classical 'bachelor pad' takeover, half lurid and half disturbing, of Bizet's immortal soul\\" and notes \\"the score's incipient vulgarity\\" and \\"grotesque elements.\\"Tuttle, classicalnet.com review. Like the music, the ballet still comes under critical fire at times. In a New York Times 2011 review of the Mariinsky staging, Alastair Macaulay faults Alonso for turning \\"the dance impulse in Bizet‚Äôs music into something heavier and more clumsily expressionistic,\\" then adds, > Nothing about \\"Carmen Suite\\" is remotely subtle, though the narrative makes > Carmen look considerably more dishonest about her change of erotic > allegiance (from Jos√© to the Torero) than in the opera. The characters keep > posing for us and one another; steps are hurled flamboyantly, like stunts. > Early on it seems Carmen is the bullfighter aiming her darts at first one > lover, then the next; but a final quartet ‚Äî featuring her, Jos√©, the Torero > and Fate ‚Äî proceeds through a certain amount of partner changing until > Carmen lies dead at Jos√©‚Äôs feet and Fate at the Torero‚Äôs. (It‚Äôs not often > that you come away feeling Fate got a rough deal.)Macaulay, NY Times review. ==References== Notes Citations Sources * Anonymous, Ballet Nacional de Cuba notes on Carmen Ballet.

It consists of an estimated 17,500 silver Roman coins dating from between 32 BC and 274 AD. The hoard was found on Beau Street about from the town's Roman Baths, built when Bath was a Roman colony known as Aquae Sulis. ==Discovery== It was discovered in 2008 by archaeologists from Cotswold Archaeology on the site of what is to be a new pool for the Gainsborough Hotel and Thermal Spa. The Grade II listed building was constructed in the 1820s by John Pinch the elder as the Bath United Hospital and later became part of Bath Technical College. The site is approximately from the Roman Baths and site of the original Temple of Minerva. The site had been excavated by James Irvin in the 1860s when the building had been expanded for a hospital extension by the architectural firm of George Phillips Manners and John Elkington Gill. Irvin had discovered a Roman bathing complex with a hypocaust floor, on the site, but it is not known whether this was a private villa or public facility. The Beau Street Hoard is the largest hoard ever found in the UK by a professional archaeologist. The coins were found fused together into a large block. It was secreted under the floor of a Roman building near the face of a masonry wall, within a small oval pit measuring about . The find's location makes it highly unusual, as hoards more typically come from rural locations. It was thought initially that the hoard comprised up to 30,000 coins but the estimated number was subsequently reduced to around 17,400. The hoard appears to have been deposited towards the end of the 3rd century AD; coins spanning a period from 32 BC to 274 AD have been identified by British Museum conservators. ==Conservation== When the hoard was discovered it was believed that it had been deposited in a wooden box which had since rotted away. The position of the hoard was recorded and then placed into a wooden crate as a single block so that it could be lifted out intact by a crane for later examination at the British Museum. X-ray analysis of the block of coins by Southampton University found that the coins had been stored in a number of leather bags. Six bags were visible on the X-rays, and two more were discovered as the hoard underwent conservation. Traces of the leather are still visible, having been partially protected from decay by contact with the copper coins, which repelled the bacteria that would otherwise have destroyed it. Each of the coins was then cleaned by manual and chemical processes to enable identification. ==Items discovered== The bags contained the following: * One bag of denarii dating from 32 BC to the 240s AD (the oldest being a coin issued by Mark Antony that was already 300 years old at the time of its deposition), plus a handful of radiates from the 250s. The most recent denarius was issued by Gordian III. * Four bags of high-silver radiates from the 3rd century, dating up to the 260s. * Three bags of debased (low-silver) radiates from the 3rd century, dating up to the 270s, consisting of coins which had been heavily debased (in some cases so much so that they were mostly bronze rather than silver). The specific contents of each bag were: {  - ! ‚Äì !! Silver radiates !! Bronze radiates !! Denarii !! Total !!

There were 25 emperors in only 50 years. Such hoards are thought to have been deposited with the intention of being recovered later once the troubles had passed, but for whatever reason the owners were unable to do so. Nor is it known whether the hoard was deposited in one go in the 270s or whether it might have been built up over time. It appears to have been amassed over a period of several decades, perhaps being redeposited from elsewhere. The hoard represented a substantial value, though the rampant inflation of the time would have eroded its worth rapidly. In the 230s it would have been equivalent to about the same as a year's pay for 18 Roman legionaries, but by 301 it would only have been the equivalent of two soldiers' annual salaries. The find has been declared treasure trove and is estimated to be worth ¬£150,000, though a formal valuation has yet to take place. The British Museum has undertaken conservation work to separate and clean the coins. ==Purchase and display== The Roman Baths Museum launched a campaign to raise the money needed to buy the hoard. The museum's bid was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and it was intended that a full catalogue of the finds would be published during 2013. In March 2014 a grant of ¬£372,500 was made by the Heritage Lottery Fund to enable the purchase of the hoard, which was put on display at the Roman Baths from January 2015. ==See also== * List of hoards in Britain * Roman currency ==References * Timelapse photography of the board undergoing micro-excavation at the British Museum * Fundraising appeal from the Roman Baths Category:2008 in England Category:2008 archaeological discoveries Category:Archaeological sites in Somerset Category:History of Somerset Category:Treasure troves in England Category:Treasure troves of Roman Britain Category:History of Bath, Somerset ","title":"Beau Street Hoard"},{"id":"35185031","text":"Victor Winston Farrell (born 8 May 1945), best known as Vic Steele, is a former British guitarist.

In 1961 he became the lead guitarist of Manchester-based group the Emperors of Rhythm, which featured Eric Stewart, later of the Mindbenders and 10CC fame, on rhythm guitar. He was also close friends with Mindbenders frontman Wayne Fontana. After the Emperors of Rhythm disbanded in the summer of 1962, Farrell decided to team up with singer Allan Clarke, singer/guitarist Graham Nash, bassist Eric Haydock and drummer Don Rathbone. The group went under several names, first calling themselves \\"The Hollies\\" for a December 1962 gig at the Oasis Club in Manchester. In 2009, Nash wrote, \\"We called ourselves The Hollies, after Buddy and Christmas.\\"2009 Graham Nash Reflections :: Introduction to autobiographical liner/CD booklet In January 1963, the Hollies performed at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, where they were seen by Parlophone assistant producer Ron Richards, who had been involved in producing the first Beatles session.

It competed at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival. The film's original title is in Tagalog: Pusong Wazak! Isa Na Namang Kwento Ng Pag-ibig Sa Pagitan Ng Isang Kriminal At Isang Puta. At the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival, however, it was given the German title Zerst√∂rtes Herz!. Ruined Heart! is the classic love story between a gangster and a prostitute, but Khavn \\"deconstructs this often recounted tale to explore in fleeting images the likelihood of dying too early from the violence so omnipresent in the Philippines today\\". ==Production== Ruined Heart! was filmed in 24 hours, in six different places in Metro Manila. The main location was the filmmaker's residence in Kamias Road. Other locations include the walled city, Intramuros; a bar in Marikina; a rooftop near Roxas Boulevard; a slum in Cambridge Street; and a vacant lot in Quezon City. Khavn, considered the father of digital filmmaking in the Philippines, is well known for his guerilla tactics: he shoots very fast with a very small crew. He explains that while more demanding on himself and on his crew, this shooting style is both practical and efficient because: > The longer it takes to make a film, the more expensive it is so I keep my > shoots short and sweet.

This research examines the economically active population (PEA) of the six largest metropolitan areas (S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Salvador and Recife). ==Definition of unemployment== The IBGE classifies as unemployed those who were not working, were available for work and had taken action to get work in the thirty days preceding the survey. For research conducted between 1983 and 2002, the IBGE considered working age population (PIA), to be those over the age of fifteen. Under the new methodology the age limit was raised to eighteen. To be considered employed, the institute once set the threshold at 15 hours per week. The new study lowers that to one hour per week. ==Results== The highest unemployment rate registered since January 2002 was April 2004 (13.1%) and the lowest was December 2011 (4.7%). Only twice, in 2006 and 2009, did the rate rise in the previous year. At the end of 2013, the unemployment rate fell to a record low 4.3% in December from an already low 4.6% in November. This marks the lowest since the current version of the Brazilian unemployment rate was first reported in 2002. A comparison with the pre-2002 unemployment rate index suggested that was the tightest labor market since at least 1980. ==Unemployment rate (%)== {  - ! Years/Months!! Jan!! Feb!! Mar!! Apr!! May!!

First, Brazil has a system called FGTS, Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Servi√ßo, which enables a set of funds to be retrieved from companies and then given to Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal, one of Brazil's top banks. These funds are then used to support employees who recently became unemployed; this happens because the employer has to collect 8% of an employee's salary and then deposit it into their Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal account every month. Next, Brazil also has a system called Aviso Previo, which grants any employee the right to work for one last month after they are fired from a company, or receive the money they would have made in one months worth of work. Furthermore, if any employee has worked at least six months, they are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits. These unemployment systems, among various others, are available for the citizens of Brazil. == Unemployment and the Economy == With Brazil being the most populated country in South America, their economy has the potential to be one of the strongest in the world. However, with over 14 million Brazilians unemployed and unemployment rate hitting an all time high in 2017 at 13.6%, things aren't looking so good for Brazil's economy. In addition, Brazil recently voted Jair Bolsonaro as their president-elect, and he has plans to conduct business with other foreign nations such as the United States. With a new president in office who plans on conducting foreign business, it will be interesting to see how this affects the economy of Brazil and also the employment rates over the presidential term. == References == ","title":"Unemployment in Brazil"},{"id":"35185231","text":"Andrew N.

He previously served under the warlord Liu Biao in the late Eastern Han dynasty. ==Life== Fu Xun was from Niyang County (), Beidi Commandery (), which is around present-day Yaozhou District, Tongchuan, Shaanxi. He was well-read and known for giving critical commentary on people. He was recruited into the civil service and served as a Gentleman of Writing (). He later moved to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) and became a guest official under the provincial governor, Liu Biao. In 208, shortly after Liu Biao's death, the warlord Cao Cao invaded Jing Province and his army arrived outside the provincial capital, Xiangyang. Fu Xun, who was then an Assistant Officer in the East Bureau (), along with Kuai Yue and Han Song (), urged Liu Biao's younger son and successor Liu Cong to yield to Cao Cao. Liu Cong heeded their advice. Fu Xun came to serve Cao Cao and received a title of a Secondary Marquis () for his effort in persuading Liu Cong to surrender. In 220, Cao Cao's son and heir Cao Pi forced the Han dynasty's last ruler Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him, and subsequently established the state of Wei, marking the start of the Three Kingdoms period. Fu Xun served as a Palace Attendant () and Master of Writing () in Cao Pi's imperial court. He died in the Taihe era (227-233) of the reign of Cao Pi's successor Cao Rui. When Fu Xun was in Jing Province, he once commented that Pang Tong was a \\"half-hero\\", and foresaw that Pei Qian () would become famous for his good moral conduct. Fu Xun's comment on Pang Tong proved accurate as the latter received lesser treatment as compared to Zhuge Liang when he came to serve Liu Bei. As for Pei Qian, he eventually became Prefect of the Masters of Writing () in Wei and enjoyed a reputation for being virtuous. When Fu Xun was serving under Cao Cao, he accurately predicted that Wei Feng would start a rebellion one day, and this came true in 219. ==See also== * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==NotesReferences== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

The law enforcement agencies, as an important instrument of the state, were given the task of protecting the citizens from criminal law enforcement. In the early 1990s, the sociopolitical and criminal situation in the Chechen Republic became extremely difficult. Periods of law \\"outrage\\" were followed by periods of prolonged fighting and, at times, anarchy. 1990s At the end of 1999, during the counter-terrorist operation in Chechnya, due to the fact that the question of the reconstruction of the Ministry of Interior, the leadership of the Russian Interior Ministry decided to establish an Office of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Chechen Republic. In order to restore the state bodies of executive power, personal security, human rights and freedoms in the Chechen Republic of the Order of the Russian Interior Ministry in December 1999 established the Office of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Chechen Republic. After many years of anarchy, bodies of internal affairs of the republic once again began its formation. The Department of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Chechen Republic with a small number of staff, consisting of units of the criminal police, police, public safety, logistics and staff divisions began their work in Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania. 2000s In April 2000, the stationed Department of Internal Affairs, with a staff of over 1,000 police officers, became the town of Gudermes. That was the beginning of the formation of organs and bodies of the future of the Chechen MVD. In order to improve the management of agencies and departments of the Interior, improve efficiency in fighting crime and maintain law and order in the Chechen Republic, on November 10, 2002, under the order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russian Federation No. 1088 the Internal Affairs Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Chechen Republic was reorganized into the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Chechen Republic. In 2000, the special police squad was one of the first frontline units that participated in special and combat operations. The number of riot police stood at about 300 fighters. The Office of the Private Security was formed in 2001 to protect the oil and gas industry, as oil business- related crime, responsible for economic and environmental damage, was widespread at that time, and oil processing plants existed in almost every village. Currently, police regiments perform tasks not only for the protection of oil complexes, but also with other parts of the Chechen police on operational, preventive and special events. Regiment patrol police in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Chechen Republic were formed in 2003. The main objective of police is to protect public order and the prevention of crimes and administrative offenses. A year later, in 2004 the Ministry of Chechen Republic created the patrol special police of Kadyrov. Today, the regiment is one of the most combat-ready mobile units in the interior of the Chechen Republic. It is the unit that fearlessly perform the most difficult and dangerous jobs, including many successful operations to free hostages, eliminate illegal armed groups, and seize weapons and ammunition. The bodies of internal affairs were formed in difficult conditions, such as the continued terrorist attacks by members of the underworld gangs, which were very high, and the level of crimes related to kidnapping. In order to intensify the fight against banditry and kidnapping, in August 2005 the structure of the republican Ministry of Interior established the Office for Combating Organized Crime, to which is assigned, among other functions assigned to counter terrorism, fighting against banditry and kidnapping. Currently, the main activities of the Special Forces, as before, are prevention of crimes within Chechen territory, the center of which is the prevention, suppression and disclosure of criminal assault on one of the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia, the right to life. == Structure == * Russian MIA Administration for the City of Grozny * Management * Office Management and Regime * Legal Department * Duty Unit * Department of Information and Public Relations * Operational Search Section * Center for Licensing * Rear * Department of Private Security * Information Center * Traffic police department * Investigative Department * Criminal Investigation Department * Office of Economic Security and Anti-Corruption * Center for Countering Extremism * Personnel Department * Forensic Center Today, the Ministry of Interior of the Chechen Republic, is staffed with all the basic service units, including 20 municipal and district departments of Interior, riot police, the Office for Combating Organized Crime, the Kadyrov regiment patrol special police, the police regiment for the protection of objects petrocomplex in the Chechen Republic, and the Office of Traffic Police. ==Ministers== Head of the Chechen Interior Department *Sergey Arenin (2000-2001) *Said-Selim Peshkhoyev (2001-2002) Minister of the Interior *Ruslan Tsakaev (December 2002-April 2003) *Alu Alkhanov (April 2003-27 December 2004) *Police Lieutenant-General Ruslan Alkhanov (since 27 December 2004) ==References * Old official homepage * New official website Category:Chechnya ","title":"Ministry of Internal Affairs (Chechnya)"},{"id":"35185328","text":"Cameron Drew Neru Howieson (born 22 December 1994) is a New Zealand footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Auckland City in the New Zealand Football Championship.

Parmigiano is no exception and so is a dialect of Emiliano-Romagnolo, not Italian. ==Classification== Parmigiano is a subdialect of Emilian, which is itself a dialect the Emiliano-Romagnolo language, which is identified as \\"definitely endangered\\" by UNESCO. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility among the various Emilian-Romagnol dialects. Emiliano- Romagnolo is part of the Gallo-Italic family, which also includes Piedmontese, Ligurian, and Lombard language. Ligurian, in particular, has influenced Parmigiano. ==History== Parmigiano has much of the history as Emilian, but at some point, it diverged from other versions of that linguistic group. It now lies somewhere between Western Emilian, which includes Piancentino, and Central Emilian, which includes Reggiano and Modenese. Like the other Emilian dialects, it has fewer speakers than ever because of political, social and economic factors, but La Repubblica has suggested that it is changing. It is still declining but more slowly, as parents are keen to preserve their ancestral roots.Gilmour Its origins are with Gauls, who occupied the Parma area in around 400 BC, who had stayed there after the invasion of the Romans. The lexicon was therefore a type of Latin influenced by Gaulish. The Gauls, or Celts, left their mark on modern Parmigiano in some words today, such as goz√®n \\"pig\\", scrana \\"chair\\" and s√¥ga \\"rope\\". As a result of Spanish and especially French invasions, Parmigiani began to use words which came from a French language that had Latin roots. That is seen in tirabus√≤n \\"corkscrew\\" (similar to Modern French's tire-bouchon) vert \\"open\\" (French: ouvert), p√≤mm da t√©ra \\"potato\\" (French: pomme de terre) and many other words. ==Geographic distribution== Parmigiano is mainly spoken in the province of Parma. The vocabulary and vowels vary across the region, particularly between the urban and rural dialects, as there was once little mobility from within to outside the city walls. The dialect spoken outside Parma is often called Arioso or Parmense within the city itself, but variation is less pronounced than it once was. The dialect spoken in Casalmaggiore in the Province of Cremona to the north of Parma is closely related to Parmigiano. Parmigiano subdialects have three forms: *Low Parmigiano, which is native to a northern part of the province that lies between the Po and the Via Aemilia and whose largest town is Colorno. *Western Parmigiano, which is heard around Fidenza and Salsomaggiore Terme and has been strongly influenced by Piacentino, another Emilian language. *High Parmigiano, which has been affected by Ligurian and is spoken in the Apennine region to the south. An example of the variation is the word bomb√®n \\"very well\\". In 1861, the popular forms were moltbein and monb√©n, but it has also taken these forms: montben, mondb√©n, moltb√©n, moltbein, monb√©n, and momb√©n. In the \\"Western Parmigiano\\" it's used a variety of locutions with the same meaning of bomb√®n, such as b√®n a bota or b√®n da b√≤n. Official status Parmigiano is not recognised as a minority dialect in the European Union or in Italy; the same is true for Emilian or Emilian- Romagnol. Since 27 June 2000, Italy has been a signatory of the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which aims to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe, but it has not ratified it. ==Writing system== Parmigiano is written using the Latin alphabet, but spelling can vary within a dialect. It has never been standardised, and the language is rarely written. Still, a number of Parmigani-Italian dictionaries have been published. Angelo Mazza and translator Clemente Bondi were prolific writers of poetry in Parmigiano. Most of the works were first published in the late 1700s or the early to mid-1800s. ==Grammar== Parmigiano is a synthetic language like Italian and French (but much less so than Classical Latin) and shares several notable features with most other Romance languages: * loss of Latin's declension and the neuter grammatical gender for nouns * development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives * new tenses formed from auxiliaries Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural); adjectives, for the number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for mood, tense, and the person and number of their subjects. Case is primarily marked using word order and prepositions, and certain verb features are marked using auxiliary verbs.  Negation  Parmigiano expresses negation in two parts, with the particle n attached to the verb and one or more negative words (connegatives) that modify the verb or one of its arguments. Negation encircles a conjugated verb with n after the subject and the negative adverb after the conjugated verb, For example, the simple verbal negation is expressed by n before the finite verb (and any object pronouns) and the adverb miga after the finite verb. That is a feature it has in common with French, which uses ne and pas. Pas derives from the Latin passus \\"step\\", and miga \\"piece of bread\\" also derives from a small quantity.Maiden & Parry, p. 104 == Samples == Here is a sample of Parmigiano, compared to Italian and English, but even within a dialect, there is variation. {  !Language !Sample - EnglishThe crow stole from the window a piece of cheese; perched on a treetop, he was ready to eat it when a fox saw him; he was absolutely starving. - ItalianIl corvo aveva rubato da una finestra un pezzo di formaggio; appollaiato sulla cima di un albero, era pronto a mangiarselo, quando la volpe lo vide; era davvero affamato. - ParmigianoAl corv l'√§va rob√® da 'na fn√©stra 'n t√≤ch √§d form√†j; poz√® insimma a 'na pianta, l'√©ra l√¨ l√¨ par magn√§rsol/magn√§rsel, quand la volpa l'al v√®dda; al gh'√§va fama dab√≥n. - } == Words == {  - !English  Parmigiano -  And  E -  Emilia  Emilja -  Romagna  R√∂magn√§ -  Italy Italja } ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:Emilia (region of Italy) Category:Emilian-Romagnol language ","title":"Parmigiano dialect"},{"id":"35185354","text":"The main aspects of maternal health are prenatal care, post-natal care, family planning and preconception.

The town is the seat of the Blouberg Local Municipality. It is located about 93 km northwest of the city Polokwane. ==Etymology== The colonial name may refer to the German industrial city of Bochum or be a corruption of Bochim, a biblical name (Judges 2:1 and 5). The place was named by the German missionary Carl Franz and his wife Helene to a mission station they established here in 1890. The majority language group of the area is Northern Sotho people and they refer to themselves as Bahananwa. They call the town Senwabarwana, a commemorative name for an incident that took place in a pond where the Khoi people found and drank water in their travelling, thus passing by. Due to their height they are proclaimed dwarfs by natives which literally means Morwana in Northern Sotho (Sepedi) and in a plural form is Barwana, hence \\"Sen-wa-barwana\\". ==History== German missionary Carl Franz and his wife Helene founded a hospital that used to cater for people with leprosy. The missionary station was part of the attempts of the Berlin Missionary Society to christianize Southern Africa in the 19th century. The hospital is now known as Helene-Franz hospital. It has a bad reputation because of its high mortality rates and it is often referred to by old people as \\"the hospital of death\\".

The digital data can be retrieved, viewed and evaluated after it has been recorded. A data logger is commonly used to monitor shipments in a cold chain and to gather temperature data from diverse field conditions. ==Construction== A variety of constructions are available. Most have an internal thermistor or thermocouple or can be connected to external sources. Sampling and measurement are periodically taken and digitally stored. Some have a built in display of data or out-of-tolerance warnings. Data retrieval can be by cable, RFID, wireless systems, etc. They generally are small, battery powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and sensors. Some data loggers interface with personal computers or smart phones for set-up, control, and analysis. Some include other sensors such as relative humidity, wind, light, etc. Others may record input from GPS devices. Depending on the use, governing quality management systems sometimes require calibration to national standards and compliance with formal verification and validation protocols Choices of temperature data loggers can be based on many factors, such as: *Cost *Reusability *Battery life *Ease of use; set-up, readability, download data, analysis, etc. *Temperature range *Number of measurements stored *Accuracy and precision - degree of agreement of recorded temperature with actual *Resolution * Response time ‚Äì the time required to measure 63.2% of the total difference between its initial and final temperature when subjected to a step function change in temperature; other points such as 90% are also used. * shock and vibration resistance *Water resistance ‚Äì humidity, condensation, etc. * Size, weight, mounting *Certifications, calibrations, etc. * Software * Data export * Data integration with other systems ==Uses== Environmental monitoring Autonomous data loggers can be taken to diverse locations that cannot easily support fixed temperature monitoring equipment.Whiteman, C. D., J. M. Hubbe, W. J. Shaw, 2000: Evaluation of an Inexpensive Temperature Datalogger for Meteorological Applications. J. Atmos. Oceanic Technol., 17, 77‚Äì81. These might include: mountains, deserts, jungles, mines, ice flows, caves, etc. Portable data loggers are also used in industry and laboratory situations where stand-alone recording is desired.  Monitor shipments  Temperature sensitive products such as foods, pharmaceuticals, and some chemicals are often monitored during shipment and logistics operations. Exposure to temperatures outside of an acceptable range, for a critical time period, can degrade the product or shorten shelf life. Regulations and contracts make temperature monitoring mandatory for some products. Battery- powered, formerly mechanical, the data logger is today an electronic device that can be programmed to record individual values over periods of a few hours to several months. Most are used to monitor temperature conditions, and some versions can also measure the relative humidity. Data loggers are often small enough to be placed inside an insulated shipping container or directly attached to a product inside a refrigerator truck or a refrigerated container. These monitor the temperature of the product being shipped. Some data loggers are placed on the outside of the package or in the truck or intermodal container to monitor the air temperature. Placement of data loggers and sensors is critical: Studies have shown that temperatures inside a truck or intermodal container are strongly affected by proximity to exterior walls and roof and to locations on the lading. Modern digital data loggers are very portable and record the actual times and temperatures. This information can be used to model product degradation and to pinpoint the location and cause of excessive exposure. The measured data reveals whether the goods in transit have been subjected to potentially damaging temperature extremes or an excessive Mean kinetic temperature. Based on this data, the options may be: * If there have not been out of tolerance temperatures for critical times, continue to use the shipment, without special inspection * If potentially damaging temperature hazards have occurred, thoroughly inspect the shipment for damage or degradation. Possibly accelerate sale and use because of reduced shelf life. * The consignee may negotiate with the carrier or shipper or even choose to reject a shipment where sensors indicate severe temperature history * The time of the temperature extreme, or GPS tracking, may be able to determine the location of the infraction to direct appropriate corrective action. Multiple replicate shipments of data loggers are also used to compare modes of shipment (routes, vendors) and to develop composite data to be used in package testing protocols. There are many brands and models of data loggers. Most are a connectable device that must be plugged into a computer to extract the data that the logger has logged. ==See also== * Data logger * Shock and vibration data logger * Time temperature indicator *Humidity indicator card ==References== Books, General References *ASTM D3103, Standard Test Method for Thermal Insulation Performance of Packages *McMillan, Gregory K, \\"Advanced Temperature Measurement and Control\\", 2010, ISA * ISTA Guide 5B: Focused Simulation Guide for Thermal Performance Testing of Temperature Controlled Transport Packaging, *Lockhart, H., and Paine, F.A., \\"Packaging of Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Products\\", 2006, Blackie, * Yam, K.

As the fifth annual race in the history of the Atlanta 500 series of racing events, it was a milestone race in NASCAR Cup Series history. Even by 1964 standards, this race was rather brutal with only ten vehicles surviving to the finish. Many of top NASCAR teams suffered from engine failure along with the non- contenders. Ford and Chevrolet used this race as a major \\"battleground\\" to determine whose vehicle was the most innovative and had the best endurance. Five terminal crashes were recorded in this event; with some footage of the event being used for the drive-in movie Speed Lovers. ==Background== Atlanta International Raceway (now Atlanta Motor Speedway) is one of ten current intermediate track to hold NASCAR races; the others are Charlotte Motor Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Darlington Raceway, Homestead Miami Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Kentucky Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway, New Hampshire Motor Speedway, and Texas Motor Speedway. However, at the time, only Charlotte and Darlington were built. The layout at Atlanta International Speedway at the time was a four-turn traditional oval track that is long. The track's turns are banked at twenty-four degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, and the back stretch are banked at five. ==Race report== All 39 drivers on the grid were American-born with no foreigners either attempting to qualify or competing in the actual race itself. Notable drivers who finished outside the top ten included Darel Dieringer, Paul Goldsmith, Roy Tyner, Cale Yarborough, LeeRoy Yarbrough, Fireball Roberts, and A. J. Foyt. Fred Lorenzen managed to defeat Bobby Isaac by two laps after almost four hours of racing action in order to extend the era of \\"Fearless Freddie's Fast Ford\\". Fifty thousand live spectators would see four caution periods lasting for 19 laps and 11 changes in the lead spot for the race. Goldsmith would flip his car after leading the first 55 laps but would get out of the wreckage completely unharmed. Jimmy Helms and Ken Spikes would make their introductions into the NASCAR professional stock car racing circuit here while Dave MacDonald would say his final goodbyes from professional auto racing here. Neil Castles ended up finishing in last-place due to a handling problem on the second lap of this 334-lap race. The total winning purse of the racing event would be $57,655 ($ when adjusted for inflation); Lorenzen would walk away with a handsome $18,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation). Twelve notable crew chiefs played a role in this event; including Jimmy Helms, Dale Inman, Herb Nab, Bud Allman, Glen Wood, Shorty Johns, Bud Moore and Banjo Matthews. The transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade. Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the \\"strictly stock\\" vehicles of the 1950s. Qualifying {  - ! Grid ! ! Driver ! Manufacturer !

Published by Taylor and Francis. ==History== Bispham depot headstone at the National Tramway Museum Construction of the tramway began in 1897. Within Blackpool, the tracks were constructed by the corporation. Services started on 14 July 1898. ==Tram depots== There were three depots: *Copse Road Depot in Fleetwood was built in 1897 with six tracks and a capacity of 18 trams. It was used as a store and service depot. After passing to Blackpool Corporation Tramways in 1920, it was used to dismantle trams. Between 1925 and 1949 a line connected the depot with the railway and was used to shunt wagons. After Blackpool Corporation sold the depot, it was used as a car showroom. The substation still fed the Fleetwood line section of the Blackpool Tramway during this time. The depot was demolished in 2016 after a scheme to convert the building into a tram museum failed, due to the poor condition of the building.http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/news/?p=14846 *Bispham Depot in Blackpool was built in 1898 and extended in 1914 to have six tracks and a capacity of 36 trams. A substation was built to the side of the depot. The depot was used to receive Blackpool Corporation Pantograph cars in 1928 and Brush Railcoach cars in 1940. It closed on 27 October 1963 and was used as a store until the mid-1970s. It was demolished to make way for a Sainsbury's supermarket and the depot's headstone was installed at the National Tramway Museum in Crich. *Bold Street Depot in Fleetwood opened in January 1899 with two tracks and a capacity of 4 trams. It was used only by the last two trams to Fleetwood in the evening and the first two trams in the morning. After Blackpool Corporation took over the tramroad in 1920, the depot was closed. Wires were taken down in 1924 when the Fleetwood loop was built. After World War II the depot was used by Fisherman's Friend. It was demolished in 1973 to make way for flats. ==Tramcar fleet== The company had a fleet of 41 tramcars in a brown and cream livery. Crossbench Rack cars Crossbench Rack car No. 2 The Crossbench Rack cars were 16 open-sided trams built between 1898-1899 by G.F. Milnes.

The series was developed and produced by Veena Sud and based on the Danish series, Forbrydelsen (The Crime). Set in Seattle, Washington, this season follows the continued investigation into the murder of local teenager Rosie Larsen, with each episode covering approximately 24 hours. The season culminated in the closing of the Larsen murder, with the discovery of those involved with the murder. ==Plot== Sarah Linden begins the season not trusting Stephen Holder, as she believes he has produced false evidence against Darren Richmond. She again puts her move to California on hold to prove Richmond's innocence. While avoiding Holder, she uncovers the truth about Richmond's location the night of Rosie Larsen's murder. That night, Richmond attempted to drown himself due to lingering grief over his wife's death; a fisherman who pulled him out of the water confirmed his story. Meanwhile, Holder learns he was a pawn in a bigger conspiracy, and his recent promotion to homicide detective had nothing to do with his police merits. The detectives reunite to resume the murder investigation, and trust and rely only on each other. Their focus turns to the casino after Sarah discovers Rosie had worked and spent time there before her death. Sarah gains access to a locked upper floor of the casino that is under construction. There, she finds an access card belonging to someone at City Hall. Darren Richmond recovers from an attempted assassination. He learns he is now a paraplegic and ponders his political future. Campaign manager Jamie Wright stays by Richmond's side during his recovery, while Richmond's girlfriend and assistant Gwen Eaton has dealt with personal guilt for contributing information that led to Darren's arrest, subsequent shooting, and the discovery that he has been unfaithful. She left Seattle for Washington, D.C. to work for a senator friend of her father's but returned to help Darren distance himself from the murder suspicion. Jamie also steels Darren's campaign resolve by suggesting the current mayor might be behind the false arrest. Darren returns to the campaign race. Stan Larsen copes with raising his sons Tom and Denny alone, while his wife Mitch has taken time away from the family. Her sister Terry goes through some financial difficulty and, since she has helped tremendously with taking care of the boys since Rosie's death, Stan allows her to stay with them. Terry, in the meantime, tries to save her relationship with married Seattle businessman Michael Ames. He eventually spurns her, vowing not to leave his wife. Mitch returns home after learning Rosie had discovered Stan was not her biological father and had visited the actual one. The man told Mitch that Rosie had spoken of leaving home. All three storylines merge when the detectives trace the access card, not to the mayor's office, but to Richmond's main office. Two people become prime suspects: Gwen, who had used the campaign car the night of the murder and had lost her access card, and Jamie, who has had dealings with Michael Ames, an apparent supporter of the current mayor. Richmond learns that Jamie has a secret about the night of the murder and questions him about it, while the detectives and Gwen realize the two are missing on election night. They track them to Darren's office, where Jamie has admitted to Darren that, on the night of the murder, Rosie had witnessed a covert meeting between him, Ames, and casino owner Nicole Jackson. The meeting was about an attempt to ruin the current mayor's campaign and seal a Richmond victory. Rosie had accidentally overheard the discussion and was discovered by Jamie, who knocked her out and eventually took her to the lake in the campaign car. He lacked the courage to drive the car into the water and had called Ames to the scene. Ames had planned to leave town with Terry at the time and, instead, Terry drove him to meet Jamie. While Jamie and Ames argued about completing the task of silencing the witness, Terry overheard Ames say he was not going to participate in a murder even if it meant he could not start his own company and leave his wife. During the argument, Terry went to the idling campaign car and shifted it into gear, causing it to go into the lake. Screams could be heard from the trunk of the car. The detectives learn of Terry's involvement after realizing that her car was the one seen dropping Ames off at home after the fact. They question her in the Larsen house with Rosie's parents present. She breaks down and confesses that she did not know it was Rosie whom Jamie had locked in the trunk of that car. The season ends with Terry being arrested, the Larsens moving to a new house after viewing a video of Rosie happily preparing to leave town, new-Mayor Richmond accepting the support of Ames and Jackson, and the detectives getting a call about a new case, with which Sarah decides not to help. ==Crew== Series developer Veena Sud also served as executive producer and showrunner of the second season, she wrote two episodes, the season premiere and co-writing the season finale.

Production began on the 13-episode second season in November 2011. Series developer Veena Sud confirmed the Rosie Larsen murder investigation would be solved, and a second case would be introduced. Mark Moses joined the recurring cast as Lt. Carlson, the detectives' new boss overseeing the Larsen investigation. Originally reported as a potential recurring character, Marin Ireland appeared as Holder's sister in an episode of the season. Mireille Enos (Sarah Linden) spoke about the differences between the series' seasons: \\"It's been a continuation ‚Äî we picked up right where we left off. Last year was exciting because it was new, but there was also the anxiety of like, 'Well, did it work?' This year we know that the formula works and there is kind of a calm about that. There haven't been any surprises about working together and letting the story unfold, and I think the writers have done a really incredible job this year.\\" Joel Kinnaman (Stephen Holder) spoke about the limits he has had with his character portrayal: \\"Until the eighth episode of the first season, there was an architecture in the storytelling where they didn't want the audience to know if Holder was a good guy or a bad guy. That was very limiting [both in terms of] what they put in the edit and the direction I was given. It wasn't until after the eighth episode that I felt I could be the character 100 percent, that I was allowed to react freely to situations. After they revealed that he wasn't a bad guy, it gave him some more space. It doesn't feel like I've been shooting more material, but it's been a little bit more about Holder's journey in the second season.\\" Brent Sexton (Stan Larsen) spoke about portraying his character from the first to second seasons: \\"I don't know if there's anything [different] in terms of the performance, but the conflict is different, and obviously Stan is going to be different. Last year Stan was a bit frozen in inaction. This year, he's trying to take action and get resolution on his past, his present, and his future, but to gain resolution on one of those creates conflict on another.\\" Billy Campbell (Darren Richmond) spoke about having to play his character from a hospital bed or a wheelchair this season: \\"It's actually kind of liberating in a strange way, acting-wise. There's not as much blocking to remember, you really can't futz around too much, and it sort of distills everything in a way. And practically speaking, it was actually a little slice of heaven because I came to work and got to lie in bed for eight hours! There were plenty of days when it came to be lunchtime and I would say, 'OK guys, see you later, wake me up when it's time for the scene after lunch!' I was hooked up to a lot of wires and it was a five minute process to get unhooked, so I did a lot of sleeping.\\" Eric Ladin (Jamie Wright) spoke about portraying a political operative: \\"I read some books and tried to track down and speak to some political advisers and strategists. There's one book in particular called How to Rig an Election by Allen Raymond ‚Äî it's a good example of somebody who learned at a young age what it's like behind the scenes of a political campaign. I took specific stories out of that book and spoke with the author briefly over the phone, and I tried to translate them into Jamie's life and shared a lot of them with Veena [Sud] and the entire writers' room.\\" When it was finally revealed to Ladin that his character was involved in Rosie's death, he reflected about the entire character portrayal: \\"I give a lot of credit to the writers. They did a great job of putting things in and adding to the story line and the back story to facilitate me with what I needed. I went back and reviewed things. I think if I'd known at the very beginning, I would have done some things different. That's probably what they were nervous about. They didn't tell me or Jamie Anne Allman for that reason. They didn't want it to influence our performances.\\" Jamie Anne Allman (Terry Marek) spoke about the seasonal transition and her view on doing guest appearances and being a regular character: \\"This season, they've written me some very interesting, unique things that I didn't get to dabble with last year. So, every scene is different and I just take each scene individually. Then when I watch it as a whole I'm like, 'Oh, it was one piece.' I take each scene, look at it, break it down and it's a new experience every time, with every scene. But being with the characters the whole time, for a long period of time really allows you to sink your teeth into something more than if you're just doing a guest star. If you're doing a guest star spot, you come in at the heightened part of your character who's having a breakdown or is having a real moment, and in a show where you're the same character the whole time it's a progression. You have to let it build.\\" She was shocked to learn that her character was Rosie Larsen's killer: \\"Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When she gave me the news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'\\" Brian Markinson (Gil Sloane) spoke about his appearance in the first season and the reveal of who his character is in the second: \\"When I was brought on in the first season, my character name on the page was 'Man in Suit.' And they said, 'You're going to be back,' but they couldn't tell me anything about anything. So I took the job thinking that my character had a history, but that he was a good guy. And then this season, I saw Veena Sud after reading the first two episodes and I said, 'You really pulled the rug out from under me!' I had just made the assumption that I was going to be this great guy who took care of Holder and had these heartfelt conversations over coffee about his addiction. So na√Øve. Dan Attias, who directed that episode, said, 'This scene is why you took the job.' It was a beautiful and surprising scene. They completely changed tack on me and in that one speech. It just completely turns the tables.\\" Katie Findlay (Rosie Larsen) spoke about playing a deceased character and about only appearing in the series during flashbacks: \\"Is there anything not strange about playing a deceased character? I've never done it before. It's interesting when you only have so much time that's in your hands to tell your part of the story. Having to pop in and out of the plot and work with the space that I had was really fun and challenging... I kind of enjoyed the space that I had to work with and I trusted that in the end that they would bring it back around. I don't think it would work if you saw more of her ‚Äî you're getting what everyone else remembers, and it's sort of all the more haunting for that.\\" == Episodes Reception== Critical response The early second-season episodes received generally favorable reviews from critics, and received a Metacritic score of 68 out of 100 based on 23 reviews. Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun- Times stated: \\"Few television shows are as addictive as this pensive, wonderfully paced suspenser.\\" The Washington Posts Hank Stuever stated: \\"My own enjoyment of The Killing begins and ends with the gloom so brilliantly conveyed by its pace and performances.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety stated the series remained \\"compelling,\\" adding \\"the writers... are adept at overcoming the stodgy pace by dangling tantalizing clues near each hour's end, creating a strong pull to see what transpires next.\\" HitFix's Alan Sepinwall compared this season to the first and called it \\"better\\". He added: \\"The performances are still good, and now the characterization is a bit better. When you add that to the fine atmosphere... and you view the mystery itself as a kind of necessary evil that allows you to see the parts of the show that do work, then it's not bad.\\" The season finale, \\"What I Know\\", received generally positive reviews. Sepinwall stated: \\"I'd like to say that season 2 of The Killing was an improvement on season 1, and in some ways, it probably was. The second season certainly did a better job of doing what Veena Sud claimed to be doing last year, in that it took advantage of the extra time to sketch in some of the characters... I honestly feel like any kinder feelings I have for the second season came from the complete lack of investment I had in it.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the finale 4.7 out of 5 stars, but, upon first viewing, \\"wasn't sure what to feel. I wasn't elated. I wasn't excited,\\" however, after watching it again, was \\"sucked into the world, mesmerized not by the victory of our hero cops...but by the gut-wrenching moments that unfolded.\\" CraveOnline's William Bibbiani called the finale \\"an odd duck\\". After citing Jamie's early revelation as \\"melodramatic silliness\\", Bibbiani added: \\"The rest of the episode gets its job done, with one major, glaring flaw. The characters end up more or less where they need to be, but some nearly ridiculous loose ends remain.\\" Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club rated this finale a C-, calling it \\"so unconvincing\\", adding \\"I couldn't believe how little all this resolution affected me after The Killing so thrillingly took my grudging engagement for a ride a few weeks ago. This is the same show that delivered Richmond's hospital nightmare, the hunt for Holder, the anti-Western standoff \\"Sayonara, Hiawatha\\", and the crazy train of the last two weeks? No, this is the full-circle episode, the one that takes the show back to its roots. Wah wah.\\" Awards and nominations In 2013, the second season earned two nominations at the 39th Saturn Awards, one for Best Syndicated Cable Television Series and for Best Actress in Television for Mireille Enos. == Home media releases == The second season of The Killing was released on DVD on April 2, 2013, exclusively through Amazon's CreateSpace manufacture-on- demand program.

Net Optics specializes in designing visibility into networks to address challenges related to virtualization, compliance and security. == Early life and business ventures == Born and raised in Israel, Matityahu moved to the United States with his parents as a teenager in 1976. He attended high school in Palo Alto, California, and earned a business degree from San Jose State University. His parents ran a restaurant that was only open for breakfast and lunch. While in business school, Eldad ran a barbecue business at their restaurant during dinner hours. He went on to open two frozen yogurt stores called \\"IT'S A RIOT! YOGURRT\\" based on a business plan he wrote for school. He sold the yogurt business three years later, switching gears to work in networking technology at a fiber optics company. He was involved in marketing and leadership development for AMP (now a division of Tyco International).Executive Profile, Bloomberg Business Week. == Net Optics == Matityahu founded Net Optics in 1996, investing the proceeds from a frozen yogurt business. Net Optics took shape in a spare room in Matityahu's apartment, bootstrapped without venture capital funding. Under his leadership, Net Optics has been profitable for every quarter since its inception. In 2011, the company was recognized by the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal as one of Silicon Valley's fastest growing companies, and by Red Herring in its North America and Global Top 100 lists. Its customers include 85% of the Fortune 100 companies. The company delivers solutions for real-time IT visibility, monitoring and control.

As an avid collector, he incorporates his passion into the corporate culture. The company's fleet of branded Mini Coopers serve as an employee perk. His interest in customizing and driving cars has been compared to his unorthodox approach to business, and Matityahu credits the hobby with stimulating his creative thinking. In 2011, Net Optics sponsored the Mille Miglia North America Tribute and the 25th annual Santa Barbara Concours d'Elegance, and Matityahu competed in the 1,000 mile race in a 1954 Corvette.Net Optics Continues 2011 Momentum, Named Best of Fose In Networking Equipment Category (video).

soldier in World War I was twelve- year-old Sidney Lewis, who fought at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Lewis's claim was not authenticated until 2013. In World War I, a number of young boys joined up to serve as soldiers before they were eighteen, the legal age to serve in the army. It was previously reported that the youngest British soldier was an unnamed boy, also twelve, sent home from France in 1917 with other underage boys from various regiments. ==George Maher== George Maher (20 May 1903 ‚Äì c.1999Richard van Emden; Steve Humphries, Veterans: the last survivors of the Great War,Pen & Sword Military (Kindle version) .) was only thirteen when he lied to a recruiting officer by claiming he was eighteen and was allowed to join up with the 2nd Battalion King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment. Maher was sent to the front lines and his actual age was not found out until he began crying during heavy shelling and was taken before an officer of his regiment to reveal his young age. George said he was then locked in a train with a number of other young boys who had all lied to join up as well. Maher said \\"The youngest was twelve years old. A little nuggety bloke he was, too.

Lewis fought in the Battle of Delville Wood which saw some of the worst casualties on the Somme. He was sent home after his mother sent his birth certificate to the War Office and demanded his return. Lewis was awarded the Victory Medal and the British War Medal. He re-enlisted in 1918 and served with the army of occupation in Austria. He joined the police in Kingston upon Thames after the war and served in bomb disposal in World War II. Later, he ran a pub in Frant, East Sussex.

Also signing up as a private at age fourteen was Reginald St John Battersby. He was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant at the insistence of his father and headmaster who thought that his rank was beneath him. Battersby was wounded by machine gun fire while leading his men over the top at the Somme.

It was created by Dion Kurczek, who founded the original Wealth-Lab, Inc. corporation in 2000. Fidelity acquired the Wealth-Lab software assets in 2004. The client runs on Microsoft Windows .NET Framework v4.0 and requires internet access to function properly. Licensed users can program and backtest trading strategies for stocks and futures. Fidelity premium account holders can use the platform to place trades produced by their trading strategies directly to their brokerage accounts and even setup auto-trading systems. ==Wealth-Lab Software Introduction== Wealth- Lab has an integrated programming environment based on C# syntax with added versatility derived from using its own pascal-like programming language, Wealthscript. Although it is geared toward programmers, it has a drag & drop feature that allows non-programmers to create their own trading strategies based on technical analysis without the necessity to edit or even view any source code. This ability to custom build trading strategies by dragging & dropping basic entry and exit modes and their indicators, not only allows non- programmers to create and use strategy scripts, it expedites the process of programming for both experienced and novice developers.Peterson, Dennis. \\"Wealth-Lab Pro\\", Stocks & Commodities (June 2012), Vol:30:6, p.56-59 Wealth- Lab requires Market data in order to perform the majority of its operations. In its standard installation, several market data sources are provided such as Yahoo! Finance's free End Of Day data. Users can also lease real-time market data from reputable sources such as Commodity System Inc. Displaying the market data in meaningful ways, i.e. charting, is one of the user's primary activity. Wealth-Lab displays market data in all the typical formats, namely, candlesticks, line, and OHLC; and even the non-typical formats such as kagi chart, Renko, equicandle to name a few. It also allows users to simply drag & drop one or more indicators, from its vast library, right onto a chart subsequently creating panels and annotations for each indicator. In addition to standard technical analysis indicators, users will also find a substantial amount of fundamental analysis indicators to apply to their charts. Backtesting strategies is at the heart of Wealth-Lab. User can either \\"Explore & Backtest\\" or \\"Build & Backtest\\". ¬¥Build¬¥ refers to the drag & drop method of strategy creation where as ¬¥Explore¬¥ refers to prebuilt strategies that are pre-installed or can be downloaded from the support website, Wealth-Lab.com managed by WL Systems, Inc.. The advantage of the prebuilt strategies is the ability to optimize the parameters. The installation comes with two optimization methods: exhaustive or Monte Carlo which uses a unique method of employing random numbers to create simulations. There are many more Wealth-Lab optimizers that can be installed from Wealth-Lab's extension manager. Developers can also program and share their own indicators, optimizers and strategy scripts, and it has been this open platform philosophy that has contributed to the establishment of a supportive developer's community. ==Wealth-Lab Client Availability== The version of the software known as Wealth-Lab Pro is only available to Fidelity premium account holders in the USA. Consumers outside of the USA (and Canada) can obtain a version of the software known as Wealth-Lab Developer via the support website. The difference between the two versions resides in their use of market data streams, custom software extensions, and technical support. Wealthlab was freely available for purchase by US and Canadian residents from Wealthlab, Inc. up until Fidelity bought the rights to use it on their web site for their account holders. After that, US and Canadian residents have been permanently banned from purchasing the software. ==Wealth-Lab Technical Support== Technical support is given to Wealth-Lab Pro users via Fidelity phone support.

Schafer is a lifetime member of the Kansas City Barbeque Society. He and his business have been featured in more than 100 publications online and in print, as well as national TV appearances. Rachael Ray Magazine featured Big Fat Daddy's for beef in Maryland. Schafer is considered an authority on dry rub seasoning and Baltimore Pit Beef. Schafer has also gained publicity for his Maryland Crab Dip in a Bread Boule appearing on season one and season two of Food Network's Carnival Eats. For 2015, York, Pennsylvania Convention and Visitor's Bureau cited Big Fat Daddy's facility a \\"Made in America Factory Tour Stop\\" in conjunction with induction of Big Fat Daddy's into the Southern Food and Beverage Museum, part of the National Food and Beverage Foundation. ==Big Fat Daddy's== Schafer learned the festival business from his stepfather in the late 1970s while working for food concessionaire, Roban Foods. Soon after high school he started J&W; Foods while working in Baltimore restaurants. Schafer's earliest print article in the Baltimore Sun Archives Maryland Section, circa 1984, shows him as selling primarily carnival type food such as Italian sausage, pizza, and onion rings. The menu later expanded to include gyros, various meat sandwiches, souvlaki, lamb sausage, cheesesteak, hot dogs, hamburgers, and soft drinks. J&W; Foods was located in Overlea, Maryland and later moved to Fawn Grove, Pennsylvania. Schafer wanted an alternative to the greasy sandwich steak being sold at fairs and festivals, and began experimenting with various cuts of beef. Wayne used his concessions knowledge to reinvent the business, and chose the name Big Fat Daddy's. The business still primarily worked concessions at fairs and festivals but featured beef and barbecue as the main attraction, even on the Cheesesteaks. The Schafer brothers became partners in a pit beef restaurant out of a small roadside shack on Route 40 in Baltimore, a stretch of roadway known as \\"Pit Beef Row\\" and considered a part of Baltimore history. It is reported that the stand closed sometime in 2003, but the building still remains and has since been operational as a pit beef stand under many different names. The Schafer brothers were the subject of many articles and books, particularly for their origination of a dry rub seasoning and the way in which the pit beef was grilled at high heat over hardwood. Feature articles about the style of beef appeared in Saveur Magazine suggesting it was considered Baltimore's version of barbecue. Soon to follow came Baltimore-raised author Steven Raichlen whose featured article in the New York Times gave away the base recipe for the dry rub seasoning. Raichlen featured Big Fat Daddy's recipes many times thereafter, reprinting them in his Barbecue Bible series of cookbooks. The Schafer brothers continued to operate at fairs, festivals, and catering events. Both operated separately and individually as Big Fat Daddy's and Brian's Big Fat Daddy's but problems ensued due to Brian's failing health and business disagreements. Court transcripts show Wayne Schafer gained full ownership of Big Fat Daddy's in 2005 after a lengthy legal battle. Brian's company was then renamed \\"Big Boy Foods\\" and operated at fairs and festivals until Brian's passing in 2014. Schafer has spoken out against beef company monopolies and the use of artificial growth hormones, and has encouraged food vendors to \\"go greener\\". He has a large Twitter following and blogs about barbecue. After nearly three decades serving the Baltimore (Rosedale) community, Big Fat Daddy's moved its operations base to Manchester, Pennsylvania in 2012, according to sources in York, Pennsylvania. Schafer supports catering events and concessions operations in eight states, teaches cooking classes and makes special appearances. ==Museum induction and permanent exhibit== In November 2014, Big Fat Daddy's was inducted into the Southern Food and Beverage Museum (SOFAB) in New Orleans, Louisiana, as part of its permanent exhibit of the \\"Trail of Smoke and Fire\\". This museum is part of the National Food and Beverage Foundation. The museum's exhibition is curated by Steven Raichlen who is credited with helping Big Fat Daddy's get early publicity. Schafer's induction was based solely on Schafer's contribution to Maryland's pit beef and dry rub culinary history which Raichlen calls \\"Baltimore's Version of Barbecue\\". Schafer's old Pit Beef Sign, vintage meat slicer, and other objects are on display from the original pit beef stand circa 1982. ==Television== Food Network Schafer's own \\"Crab Dip in a Bread Boule\\" recipe was chosen to air on season one of the Cooking Channel's Carnival Eats television show in episode 1.2 entitled \\"Viva! Vienna! Festival; Contraband Days Festival\\" with original air date August 25, 2014. Schafer is seen showing host Noah Cappe how to make his famous Maryland recipe. The episode was filmed in Vienna, Virginia in May 2014. Schafer tailored a recipe from his mother, who was from Salisbury, on the Eastern Shore. Schafer was invited back to the show and featured as a repeat guest for his \\"Colossal Got Beef Crabcake Sandwich\\" on season 2 episode 2.7 \\"From Strawberry to Silver Dollar\\", which first aired on September 10, 2015. This award-winning crab cake was topped with Schafer's famous pit beef and included bacon, cheddar, provolone and crab dip. The episode was filmed at the Brandywine Strawberry Festival in Brandywine, Pennsylvania earlier in June that year. ABC affiliates Schafer has made several TV appearances on ABC stations supporting local fairs of which he's been a long-time veteran. In June 2017, he was a guest on Washington D.C.'s ABC 7-WJLA morning show, \\"Let's Talk\\", where he served his pork BBQ to meteorologist Brian van de Graaff and show host Julie Wright, talking primarily of the benefits of attending the Celebrate Fairfax! Festival. In the same month, he was featured on ABC News 27-WHTM speaking of the 89th annual Jubilee Day in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. ==Hogging Up BBQ Festival== Schafer hosted and promoted the Hogging Up BBQ & Music Festival, the first of which was first held in 2013 in Clear Brook, Virginia and benefited four non-profit groups. The festival is also a Kansas City Barbeque Society sanctioned event. The festival ran again in 2014 in Clear Brook, Virginia, benefitting the local SPCA; it also included a backyard barbecue festival and car show. Plans for a later Hogging Up West Virginia festival and 2015's festival fell through due to lack of sponsorship. Schafer stated on the Hogging Up WV site, that the WV event was cancelled due to \\"variety of reasons\\", although the main one noted was a lack of sponsors. ==Tour stop== Big Fat Daddy's was named a 2015 York, Pennsylvania Factory Tour Stop by the York Convention and Visitor's Bureau. The mini tour of the Pitmaster Facility and view of his mini grilling collection features history and artifacts of Swift and Company and C.F. Sauer Company. Schafer announced that his 2015 tour would be donating a portion of each admission to support Bell Family Shelter. ==Trademarks== Schafer and his wife own four trademarks jointly, including three on Got Beef?¬Æ products in various class codes including housewares, cups, and mugs. Additional trademarks are owned for Got Beef?¬Æ on clothing, namely, women's apparel, men's apparel, children's apparel, T-shirts, button up shirts, shorts, hoodies, sweatshirts, jackets, skull caps, and hats (apparel), and a third for spice rubs. Additionally, Schafer owns the hashtag rights to #BFD when used in conjunction with marketing. ==Personal life== Schafer began working for his parents' concessions company, Roban Foods. This training helped him start his own business soon after high school. Schafer attended Towson High School and grew up in the Towson and Rosedale areas of Baltimore County. While working his first company, J&W; Foods, Schafer also worked at many local restaurants in the Baltimore area, including Gibby's, Chiapparelli's, and Tully's. At one point in life, Schafer obtained his Commercial Driver's License and considered a change of career from the hectic concessions business, but disliked the long time away from his family during a stint with Schneider. Schafer's family dedicates Mother's Day to raising money for Bell Socialization Services' family shelter in York, Pennsylvania. Schafer also ran a several-year scholarship for Kenwood High School in remembrance of Anna Stickel, a young teen (he had never met) who was hit crossing the railroad tracks in his home town of Baltimore, to raise awareness. Schafer is a fan of the Baltimore Orioles and Baltimore Ravens. He cooks for enjoyment and although he is a lifetime member of the Kansas City Barbeque Society and Mid Atlantic Barbecue Association, he does not compete due to his hectic work schedule. He enjoys fishing and boating. Schafer has three children from previous marriages. He resides in Baltimore, Maryland and Danforth, Maine with third wife Cindy Fahnestock-Schafer, also known as artist and book author Ira Mency. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Barbecue Category:People from Towson, Maryland Category:People from York County, Pennsylvania Category:Living people ","title":"Wayne Schafer"},{"id":"35186248","text":"Granduc Copper Mine Overlooking the Salmon Glacier, the Granduc Mine is a large copper mine which is situated on a rock ridge between a glacier and a cliff, some north of Stewart, BC at the north end of Summit Lake.

The canopy is attached to the carriage at four points, instead of the more conventional two points, to improve stability. In flight steering is accomplished via rail- mounted sliding foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. Steering is via a 2:1 ratio system of pulleys that reduce the force required and increase control authority. The lack of pivoting control bars allows cockpit fairings to be fitted.

He was the son of the artist Sir Herbert Hughes-Stanton. He exhibited with the Society of Wood Engravers, but was more in sympathy with the philosophy of the English Wood Engraving Society, of which he was a founding member in 1925.Joanna Selborne, 'The Society of Wood Engravers: the early years' in Craft History 1 (1988), published by Combined Arts. He co-directed the Gregynog Press from 1930 to 1933 with his wife, Gertrude Hermes. ==The early years== At the age of 13 Hughes-Stanton, unable to face the prospect of home life with his three sisters, joined the Royal Navy training ship HMS Coway. At the age of 19 he switched direction completely after a conversation with his father, the Royal Academician Sir Herbert Hughes-Stanton, and joined the Byam Shaw School of Art. There he came under the influence of Leon Underwood and, in 1921, he moved to Underwood's Brook Green School.Christopher Neve, Leon Underwood (London, Thames and Hudson, 1974), . In 1922 he joined the Royal Academy Schools, but Underwood remained the dominant influence on him. At Brook Green the American wood engraver Marion Mitchell introduced him to wood- engraving, which set the direction of his life. Underwood and he were kindred spirits, to such an extent that, in 1925, Underwood left Hughes-Stanton in charge of the Brook Green School when he went to America. Hughes-Stanton met Eric Kennington, who introduced him to T. E. Lawrence. Hughes-Stanton was commissioned to engrave ten tail-pieces for the monumental limited edition of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1926). Some extra special copies had a full-page engraving by Hughes-Stanton for the dedicatory poem to \\"S.A.\\". Other commissions followed and, in the next few years, he illustrated with wood engravings three tall folios for the Cresset Press ‚Äî The Pilgrim's Progress (1928), The Apocrypha (1929) and D. H. Lawrence's Birds, Beasts and Flowers (1930). In 1925 he fell in love with Gertrude Hermes, a fellow student at Brook Green and another member of the Underwood inner circle. In 1926 he sold his copy of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom for ¬£100 and married her. They had two children, Judith (born 1927) and Simon (born 1928). ==The Gregynog Press and Gertrude Hermes== In 1930 Hughes-Stanton and Hermes, along with William McCance and Agnes Miller Parker, were appointed in various capacities to the artistic and business management of the Gregynog Press.Dorothy A. Harrop, A History of the Gregynog Press (Pinner, Private Libraries Association, 1980), . Hughes-Stanton produced his characteristic wood engravings for Comus by John Milton in 1931, Erewhon by Samuel Butler in 1932 and The Revelation of Saint John the Divine, Four Poems by Milton and The Lamentations of Jeremiah, all of which appeared in 1933. Relations were strained in a number of areas. Some of the board at Gregynog felt that Hughes-Stanton's wood engravings were too erotic, and his personal conduct was upsetting Margaret and Gwendoline Davies, who owned the press. In 1930 Hughes-Stanton had started an affair with Ida Graves, who offered him \\"Lawrentian sex\\". In March 1932 Hermes left Hughes- Stanton and moved back to London, where she stayed with Leon Underwood. Hughes-Stanton left the press in September 1933. ==The Gemini Press and Ida Graves== When Hughes-Stanton left the Gregynog Press he returned to London with Ida Graves. Hermes had divorced him, and Graves's husband, Herbert Marks, had left her for Isobel Powys, removing their two children. Marks would not contemplate divorce, however, because of his social position, and gave Graves a weekly allowance of ¬£4 a week provided that she took the blame for the separation. Hughes-Stanton and Graves had two children - Corin (born 1933) and Kristin (born 1935). The couple moved to Higham, near Colchester, and founded the Gemini Press. Hughes-Stanton wrote in his first prospectus, \\"I have founded the Gemini Press to be able, when occasion arises and unhampered by any outside prejudices, to make books in which there is a real fusion between contemporary writer and artist.\\"Blair Hughes-Stanton, Intimation in the prospectus for Epithalamion, the Gemini Press. In 1934 the press produced Epithalamion by Ida Graves, with 23 full-page wood engravings by Hughes- Stanton. The book is a celebration of their physical and spiritual wedding, even though they were unable to marry. Only half the edition was sold at the time of publication, partly because of the depression, but also a lack of business competence. In 1970 Hughes-Stanton offered the remaining 25 sets of Japan Vellum sheets and 125 sets of Basingwerk sheets to the Basilisk Press. In 1935 the press produced its second and final illustrated book, Pastoral, or Virtue Requited by H.H.M. (Herbert Marks). They needed the money, but it must have been galling for the couple. This period was a time of financial hardship for the couple, and commissions dried up completely at times. They moved to a late mediaeval timber house in Stratford Saint Mary, which they spent years restoring. By 1939 their relationship was almost at an end. Hughes-Stanton produced a number of books, more or less significant, during this period. They include The Ship of Death by Lawrence (1933), Primeval Gods by Christopher Sandford (1934), Ecclesiastes and A Crime against Cania, both for the Golden Cockerel Press and both 1934, and Address by Abraham Lincoln at the Dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg (1936), an unillustrated book printed by Hughes-Stanton at the Gemini Press in an edition of 50 copies, not for sale, the final publication of the press. In 1938, Hughes-Stanton won the International Prize for Engraving at the Venice Biennale. ==The Second World War== A cattle-truck Journey from Salonika to Germany, 1941 (1944) (Art.IWM ART LD 3838) At the start of the Second World War, Hughes-Stanton, like many other artists, undertook camouflage work before he enlisted in the British Army. In 1940 he joined the Royal Engineers. He served in the Middle East and then transferred to Greece, where he was captured. An over zealous prison guard in the temporary P.O.W. camp at Corinth shot him in the throat and skull when he strayed too close to the camp wire. His injury incapacitated him and he was moved to a series of camps in Germany, and he was finally repatriated to Britain in August 1943. Back in England he wrote to the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) in November 1943, seeking a painting commission. After a meeting with Kenneth Clark, the chairman of WAAC, he was given a commission to paint three pictures based on his experiences as a POW. After Blair-Stanton completed these, WAAC purchased two more pictures from him. ==The later years and Anne Ross== Hughes-Stanton had already started teaching at the Westminster School of Art before the war, and he now became more and more reliant on teaching ‚Äì at Colchester School of Art, Saint Martin's School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design. Even in his 70s he was teaching at Winchester School of Art. He had very few commissions during this period, and the engravings for his best-known book from this period ‚Äì The Confessions of an English Opium Eater by Thomas de Quincey (Folio Society, 1948 and 1963) ‚Äì were engraved in the early 1930s for the Fanfrolico Press. In 1955 he began to work with Lewis and Dorothey Allen of the Allen Press in California, and produced five books for them, mostly illustrated with linocuts. Hughes-Stanton left Graves in 1950 and took refuge with Gertrude Hermes. In 1952 he married Anne Ross, a former student, with whom he had two daughters: Penelope (born 1954) and Chlo√´ (born 1955). He died in 1981, and his ashes were scattered on the River Stour, Suffolk, by his two friends from the local pub, Peter and Joe.An account of his life by the British Council. There was an exhibition of his work at the Studio One Gallery in Oxford in 1982,William McCance, Blair Hughes-Stanton (1902‚Äì1981) (Oxford, Studio One Gallery, 1982). and a memorial exhibition at the Minories Gallery, Colchester, in 1984.Anon, Blair Hughes-Stanton: Printmaker Book Illustrator (Colchester, Minories Gallery, 1984). ==His life and work== Although he did some work in oils and spent a great deal of time experimenting with linocuts in his later years, Hughes-Stanton's artistic production consists mostly of wood engravings. He is known for the very fine white lines of his engravings, which presented considerable difficulty to pressmen trying to print his engravings on hard handmade paper.Paul Collet, \\"Blair Hughes-Stanton on Wood-engraving\\" in Matrix 2 (1982), published by the Whittington Press. The engravings are frequently of the female form, and contemporary judgements ranged from erotic to pornographic. Towards the end of his career his engravings featured semi- abstract figures. Examples of his fine cutting and individual style can be seen at the British Council website. It is instructive to compare his career with that of his first wife, Gertrude Hermes. When they were married their careers showed equal promise. Clare Leighton wrote of him at the time: \\"Of the same school is Blair Hughes Stanton (sic), equally brilliant, if not superior, in craftsmanship. ... (he) is paying the price of his brilliance by having many imitators.\\"Clare Leighton, Wood Engravings of the 1930s (London, Studio, 1936). Hermes was elected a Royal Academician in 1971; Hughes-Stanton never received such an honour. Hermes had her retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy; the retrospective at the Whitechapel Gallery for which Hughes-Stanton spent years collecting material never took place. Hermes' career moved ever upwards; that of her former husband moved from the creative brilliance of the Gregynog years to years of teaching into his 70s to make a living. One must not, however, forget the brilliance of his early years and the influence that he had on wood engraving in the first half of the twentieth century. Works illustrated include ‚Äì *T. E.

Today, it is a real-time software-focused professional group made up of industry suppliers, customers, academia, and users. The FACE approach is a government-industry software standard and business strategy for acquisition of affordable software systems that promotes innovation and rapid integration of portable capabilities across programs. The FACE Consortium provides a vendor-neutral forum for industry and government to work together to develop and consolidate the open standards, best practices, guidance documents, and business strategy necessary to result in:FACE Consortium Information, uploaded with permission *Standardized approaches for using open standards within avionics systems *Lower implementation costs of FACE systems *Standards that support a robust architecture and enable quality software development *The use of standard interfaces that will lead to reuse of capabilities *Portability of applications across multiple FACE systems and vendors *Procurement of FACE conformant products *More capabilities reaching the customer faster *Innovation and competition within the avionics industry The FACE Technical Standard is an open real-time standard for making safety- critical computing operations more robust, interoperable, portable and secure. Although the consortium started with a focus on avionics, the applicability of the technical standard and its associated data model have become much broader. The standard enables software developers to create and deploy a wide catalog of applications for use across the entire spectrum of real-time systems through a common operating environment. The latest edition of the standard further promotes application interoperability and portability with enhanced requirements for exchanging data among FACE components, including a formally specified data model, and emphasis on defining common language requirements for the standard. == Background == The FACE effort sprang from US Navy open architecture programs,FACE initiative takes aim at improved interoperability and standards among future military avionics platforms promoted by the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), to enhance interoperability and software portability for avionics software applications across DoD aviation platforms. Both the US Army and US Air Force have been participating in the consortium.

In October 2016, a suite of flight management software earned the first FACE certificate of conformance. One may view information on all certified FACE conformant products at the FACE Registry ==Technical approach== The FACE technical approach tackles barriers to software modularity, portability, and interoperability by defining a Reference Architecture and employing design principles to enhance software portability. To meet the objectives of the technical approach, the FACE Technical Standard uses a standardized architecture describing a conceptual breakdown of functionality, called the FACE Reference Architecture, to promote the reuse of software components able to share common functionality across disparate systems. This architecture defines standardized interfaces to allow software components to be moved between systems, including those developed by different vendors. The standardized interfaces follow a data architecture to ensure the data communicated between the software components is fully described to facilitate their integration on new systems. FACE Reference Architecture The FACE Reference Architecture is composed of logical segments where variance occurs. The structure created by connecting these segments together is the foundation of the FACE Reference Architecture. The five (5) segments of the FACE Reference Architecture are the Operating System Segment (OSS), Input/Output Services Segment (IOSS), Platform-Specific Services Segment (PSSS), Transport Services Segment (TSS), and Portable Components Segment (PCS). The FACE Reference Architecture defines a set of standardized interfaces providing connections between the FACE architectural segments. The standardized interfaces within the FACE Reference Architecture are the Operating System Segment Interface (OSS Interface), the Input/Output Services Interface (IOS Interface), the Transport Services Interfaces, and Component-Oriented Support Interfaces. The FACE Reference Architecture defines three FACE OSS Profiles tailoring the Operating System (OS) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), programming languages, programming language features, run-times, frameworks, and graphics capabilities to meet the requirements of software components for differing levels of criticality. The three Profiles are Security, Safety, and General Purpose. The Security Profile constrains the OS APIs to a minimal useful set allowing assessment for high-assurance security functions executing as a single process. The Safety Profile is less restrictive than the Security Profile and constrains the OS APIs to those that have a safety certification pedigree. The General Purpose Profile is the least constrained profile and supports OS APIs meeting real-time deterministic or non-real-time, non- deterministic requirements depending on the system or subsystem implementation. The FACE Data Architecture defines the FACE Data Model Language (including the language binding specification), Query and Template language, FACE Shared Data Model (SDM) and the rules of construction of the Unit of Portability (UoP) Supplied Model (USM). Each PCS Unit of Conformance (UoC), PSSS UoC, or TSS UoC providing using TS Interfaces is accompanied by a USM consistent with the FACE SDM and defines its interfaces in terms of the FACE Data Model Language. A Domain-Specific Data Model (DSDM) captures content relevant to a domain of interest and can be used as a basis for USMs. ==References== Category:Computer standards Category:Open Group standards Category:Open standards ","title":"Future Airborne Capability Environment"},{"id":"35186464","text":"The South Shields Tramways operated a tramway service in South Shields between 1883 and 1906.The Golden Age of Tramways.

(Eds.), (1997). DC: 0-3 Casebook. Zero to Three Publisher. It is organized into a five-part axis system.Zero To Three (2005). Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood: Revised Edition (dc:0-3r). Washington, DC, ZERO TO THREE Press. The book has been translated into several languages and its model is widely adopted for the assessment of children of up to five years in age. The DC 0-3R is meant to complement, but not replace, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization. It is intended to enhance the understanding of young children by making it possible to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health problems in infants and toddlers by allowing for the identification of disorders not addressed in other classification systems. The DC: 0-3R is organized around three primary principles: 1) that children's psychological functioning unfolds in the context of relationships, 2) that individual differences in temperament and constitutional strengths and vulnerabilities play a major role in how children experience and process events, and 3) that the family's cultural context is important for the understanding of the child's developmental course. ==History== The first version, DC: 0-3, was published in 1994 to address the need for a systematic approach to the classification of disorders in the first few years of life. Since then, it has become increasingly valued by mental health professionals, physicians, nurses, early educators, and researchers around the world, and has been published in 8 different languages in addition to the original English edition. Current Edition Revisions to the DC: 0-3 were published in 2005 to account for the evolution of the classification system from the time when it was first published in 1994. To be addressed were certain limitations such as the lack of criteria in some of the classification categories and the need for certain clarifications. Most importantly, new knowledge from research and clinical experience dating from almost a decade was to be incorporated. ==The Diagnostic Process== The diagnostic process is one that is ongoing and done over a period of time. The process includes gathering a series of information regarding the child's behaviour and presenting problems. The information is collected by a clinician and pertains to the child's adaptation and development across different occasions and contexts. According to the DC: 0-3R, the diagnostic process consists of two aspects: 1) the classification of disorders, and 2) the assessment of individuals. One of the primary reasons for the classification of disorders is to facilitate communication between professionals. Once a diagnosis has been made, a clinician can then make associations between their clients‚Äô symptoms and previously existing knowledge regarding the disorders' etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. Furthermore, using the classification of disorders can facilitate the process of finding existing services and mental health systems that are appropriate for the particular needs of the affected child. The assessment of children thus becomes a pivotal process that is undertaken by clinicians in order to grant access to treatment and intervention services related to specified disorders. Clinical assessment and diagnosis involves making observations and gathering information from multiple sources relating to the child's life in conjunction with a general diagnostic scheme. Both the DSM and ICD classification systems have evolved to use a multiaxial scheme, thus, clinicians have been using them not only for the classification of disorder but also as a guide for assessment and diagnosis. The first three axes of the DSM and ICD relate to the classification of disorder, and the fourth and fifth relate to the assessment of the individual within their personal environment. Similarly, the DC: 0-3 and DC: 03R also follow a multiaxial scheme. Classification The DC 0-3R provides a provisional diagnosis system, focusing on multi-axial classification. The system is a provisional system because it recognizes the fluidity and change that may occur with more knowledge in the field. This classification system is not entirely synonymous with the DSM-IV and the ICD-10, because it concentrates on developmental issues. There is also an emphasis placed on dynamic processes, relationships, and adaptive patterns within a developmental framework. The use of this classification system imparts knowledge about the diagnostic profile of a child, and the various contextual factors that may contribute to difficulties. The DC 0-3R functions as a reference for the earlier manifestations of problems in infants and children, which can be connected to later problems in functioning. Secondly, the categorization focuses on types of difficulties in young children that are not addressed in other classification models. The diagnostic categories vary in description, with more familiar categories described less. Categories that are more specific to young childhood and infancy, and newly based on clinical approaches are described in more detail. Furthermore, some categories may have subtypes to promote research, clinical awareness, and intervention planning, whereas others do not. This is important information to keep in mind when reading the DC 0-3R. The Multi-Axial System =Axis I: Clinical Disorders= Axis 1 of the DC 0-3R provides diagnostic classifications for the most primary symptoms of the presenting difficulties. These diagnoses focus on the infant or child's functioning. The primary diagnoses include: *Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: This refers to children who may be experiencing or have experienced a single traumatic event (e.g. an earthquake), a series of traumatic events (e.g. air raids), or chronic stress (e.g. abuse). Furthermore, the nature of the trauma and its effect on the child must be understood in the context of the child. Specifically, attention must be paid to factors such as social context, personality factors, and the caregivers‚Äô ability to assist with coping. *Disorders of Affect: This classification of disorders is related to the infant or child's affective and behavioural experiences. This group of disorders includes mood disorders and deprivation/maltreatment disorder. This classification focuses on the infant or child's functioning in its entirety rather than a specific event or situation. (See Affective spectrum) *Adjustment Disorder: When considering a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, one has to examine the situational factors to determine if it is a mild disruption in the child's usual functioning (e.g. switching schools). These difficulties must also not meet the criteria for other disorders included in the categories. *Regulation Disorders of Sensory Processing: The child manifests difficulties in regulating behavioural, motor, attention, physiological, sensory, and affective processes. These difficulties can affect the child's daily functioning and relationships. (See Sensory processing disorder) *Sleep Behaviour Disorder: To diagnose a sleep disorder, the child should be showing a sleep disturbance and not be demonstrating sensory reactive or processing difficulties. This diagnosis should not be used when sleep problems are related to issues of anxiety or traumatic events. *Eating Behaviour Disorder: This diagnosis may become evident in infancy and young childhood as the child may show difficulties in regular eating patterns. The child may not be regulating feeding with physiological reactions of hunger. This diagnosis is a primary diagnosis in the absence of traumatic, affective, and regulatory difficulties. (See Eating disorder) *Disorders of Relating and Communicating: These disorders involve difficulties in communication, in conjunction with difficulties in regulation of physiological, motor, cognitive, and many other processes. =Axis II: Relationship Classification= Axis II focuses on children and infants developing in the context of emotional relationships. Specifically, the quality of caregiving can have a strong impact in nurturance and steering a child on a particular developmental course, either adaptive or maladaptive. This particular axis concentrates on the diagnosis of a clinical issue in the relationship between the child and the caregiver. The presence of a disorder indicates difficulties in relationships. These disorders include various patterns that highlight behaviour, affective, and psychological factors between the child and the caregiver. *Overinvolved *Underinvolved *Anxious/Tense *Angry/Hostile *Mixed Relationship Disorder *Abusive =Axis III: Medical and Developmental Disorders and Conditions= Axis III focuses on physical, mental, or developmental classification using other diagnosis methods. These disorders and conditions are not treated as a single diagnosis, but as a problem that may co-exist with others, as it may involve developmental difficulties. =Axis IV: Psychosocial Stressors= This axis allows clinicians to focus on the intensity of psychosocial stress, which may act as influencing agents in infant and childhood difficulties/disorders. Psychosocial stress can have direct and indirect influences on infants and children, and depends on various factors. =Axis V: Emotional and Social Functioning= Emotional and social functioning capacities can be assessed using observations of the child with primary caregivers. The essential domains of functioning can be used in these observations on a 5-point scale, that describes overall functional emotional level. Rating Scales and Checklists The DC: 0-3R contains four forms that aid clinicians in identifying disorders in infants and toddlers, in examining the extent of problem behaviours, and in determining the nature of external factors influencing the child. *Functional Rating Scale for Emotional and Social Functioning Capacities: to evaluate the child's communication skills and expressions of thoughts and feelings. *The Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS; from Axis II): to evaluate the quality of a caregiver-child relationship and identify relationship disorders. *Relationship Problems Checklist (RPCL; from Axis II): allows the clinician to identify the extent to which a caregiver-child relationship can be described by a number of criterion-based qualities. *Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors Checklist (from Axis IV): to provide information on the stressors experienced by the child in various contexts. ==The Future of DC 0-3R== Important questions remain to be answered, in spite of the revisions made in the DC: 0-3R. Such questions include the following: #How can the functional adaptation of infants and children be evaluated and described independent of diagnosis? # How can disruptive behaviours of typical development in infants and children be distinguished from disordered behaviours that lead to atypical development? # Should Excessive Crying Disorder be considered as a functional regulatory disorder? Other functional regulatory disorders include Sleeping Behaviour and Feeding Behaviour Disorders. # Should future editions of the DC: 0-3 include a Family Axis containing information about family history of mental illness, family structure and available supports, and family culture? These aspects are all central to assessment and treatment planning. ==References== Category:Human development Category:Diagnosis classification ","title":"Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood"},{"id":"35186488","text":"The 2012 Northern Arizona Lumberjacks football team represented Northern Arizona University in the 2012 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

Now years old, she is one of several Toronto Island ferries operating between the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal at Bay Street and Queens Quay and three landing points on the Toronto Islands. She is the last sidewheel-propelled vessel on the Great Lakes. ==History== The ship was built in 1910 by Polson Iron Works at a cost of . The 1,450-capacity (reduced later to 995) ferry was built for and initially operated by the Toronto Ferry Company. She was launched on June 18, 1910, christened with a bottle of champagne by eight-year-old Phyllis Osler, granddaughter of politician Edmund Boyd Osler. The ferry entered service on July 1, 1910. Trillium's sister ship, Bluebell and other ferries Primrose and Mayflower in the company's fleet were also named after flowers. In 1926, the City of Toronto acquired Trillium and the other ferries in the Toronto Ferry Company's fleet, and took over all ferry services. Nine boats and half-acre of land on Hanlan's Point was bought for . The ferry was remodelled by the Toronto Transit Commission, replacing worn woodwork and the main deck cabin, and removing the side gangways and officer daycabins. Trillium was retired in 1957 and sold for to the Toronto Works Department, which intended to use it to carry sewage sludge from the new Humber Sewage Treatment Plant. It was left to sink in a lagoon in the Toronto Islands, along with her sister vessel Bluebell. Unlike Bluebell, which was converted to a garbage scow, Trillium was left to deteriorate, its metal fittings stripped by scavengers and souvenir hunters. In the sixties, there was renewed interest in the Trillium. First, in 1964, it was proposed to display the Trillium along with other historic boats at the Toronto Maritime Museum at the Exhibition grounds but the proposal failed. In 1965, it was then proposed to return the boat to service. Partly due to the advocacy of historian Mike Filey and Toronto Parks Commissioner Tommy Thompson, Metro Toronto approved her restoration in 1973. The restoration at a cost of ($ in dollars), was chosen over building a new ferry which would have cost three to four million dollars. Champion Engineering Ltd. supervised the restoration, which was done in Port Colborne, Ontario at the E. B. Magee drydock in Ramey's Bend. The restoration replaced the superstructure, boiler and deck. Original gauges and other 1910-era accessories were salvaged from Toronto Department of Public Works pumping stations. Other items were salvaged from the boats Imperial Windsor and Texaco Brave which were being scrapped. Several replicas were made of original parts, such as the brass bells and the beavers adorning the sides of the paddle boxes. The boat was rebuilt as close as possible to the original 1910 plans. The ship returned to Toronto Harbour in November 1975. The ship was rechristened on June 18, 1976, 66 years after her first launch, the ceremony officiated by the same Phyllis Osler Aitken. She was returned to service on July 1, 1976, on runs to Hanlan's Point only, the other island ferry docks having been converted for the other ferries. This caused numerous complaints, notably Johnny Lombardi, who offered to get volunteers to rebuild the Centre Island docks in time for the annual CHIN picnic. In 2017, Trillium was refurbished at a cost of . The refurbishment will extend its lifespan. The repairs included replacements to sections of the hull and rudder and three new coats of paint. ;Incidents In 1910, Trillium helped douse a fire on the harbourfront. Toronto Ferry Company owner Lol Solman operated the hose himself from the second level of Trillium to douse the flames at the Niagara dock. In 1911, Trillium ran aground while on her return from a lacrosse match. The ferry Island Queen took off 600 passengers, then ran aground herself. Launches, sailboats, rowboats and canoes had to come to the rescue of the 2,000 stranded people. That year the water level of Lake Ontario was the lowest it had been since 1874. On July 15, 1916 at 3pm, the Trillium was docking at Hanlan's Point dock to discharge passengers going to a baseball game. As it was docking, it created a side-wash that overcame and capsized a canoe being paddled by couple Sam Sniderman and Rose Ezrin nearby. By the time people could reach the scene, the couple had disappeared underwater and drowned. Their bodies were found within minutes but could not be revived. Trillium collided with the former MS Normac in 1981.mirror Normac, a former Great Lakes passenger vessel had been converted to Captain John's Harbour Boat Restaurant, and had been permanently moored in the Yonge Street slip since 1970. A mechanical failure caused Trillium to fail before colliding with the restaurant. The restaurant developed a slow leak, which caused her to sink two weeks later. A 29-year-old man drowned after jumping off Trillium while attending the 1993 Caribana festival. He jumped off at 11 pm on July 29, telling friends that he would meet them on shore at Ontario Place. Trillium was about from shore. Police recovered his body on July 30. The victim's mother was hurt by speculation about his sobriety.

Francis James Jackson (December 1770 ‚Äì 5 August 1814) was a British diplomat, ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Prussia and the United States. ==Career== Francis Jackson entered the diplomatic service aged only 16 and served as a Foreign Office clerk. In April 1788 he brought back from The Hague the signed copy of \\"a treaty of defensive alliance between His Majesty and the States General of the United Provinces\\" which was signed on 15 April. This treaty and a subsequent alliance with Prussia in August 1788 created a \\"Triple Alliance\\" against Russia which, however, lasted only until 1791. In 1789 Jackson was appointed Secretary to the British legation in Berlin. He later held a similar post in Madrid where he acted as Minister (head of mission) ad interim after the departure of Lord St Helens in 1794 until the arrival of the Marquess of Bute in 1795 (because Lord Yarmouth, who should have succeeded St Helens, did not go). Jackson was then appointed ambassador to the Ottoman Porte in 1796. In November 1801 Marquess Cornwallis was sent to France to finalise peace terms: the negotiations took place at Amiens, and resulted in the Treaty of Amiens signed on 25 March 1802. Cornwallis took with him to Amiens the secretary to the embassy in Paris, Anthony Merry, and Jackson was sent to take Merry's place ad interim with the rank of minister-plenipotentiary. In October 1802 he moved on to be Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Prussia in Berlin, where he stayed until 1806 when Prussia was defeated in the War of the Fourth Coalition. In 1807 he was sent on a special mission to Denmark where he witnessed the bombardment of Copenhagen. In 1809 Jackson was sent to Washington, D.C., as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary after the recall of David Erskine when the British government refused to ratify Erskine's attempt to resolve the difficulties following a conflict between HMS Leopard and the US frigate Chesapeake (the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard Affair). Jackson remained at Washington until 1811. He died at Brighton, after a long illness, in 1814.

In 2004, he helped to establish the Center for Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona and was its Director between 2004 and 2014. ==Education== Izpisua graduated from the University of Valencia, Spain with a bachelor's degree in Pharmacy and Science. He then earned a master's degree in Pharmacology from the same university before moving on to complete his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Pharmacology at the University of Bologna, Italy and the University of Valencia, Spain. He followed that with a stage as a postdoctoral fellow in different institutions, including the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), in Heidelberg, Germany and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, USA prior to moving to the Salk Institute in 1993. ==Career== He is a main catalyzer in one of today's most promising areas of biomedicine: regenerative medicine. His work may help to discover new molecules and specific gene/cell treatments to prevent and cure diseases affecting mankind both in the adult and embryonic stages, as well as inducing endogenous in vivo regenerative responses that may allow for tissue and organ regeneration in humans. It also may contribute to increase our knowledge of aging and aging-associated diseases, thereby leading to healthier aging and increased lifespan. His conceptual discoveries and methodologies for regenerative medicine include: * Elucidating some of the key cellular and molecular bases of how an organism with millions of cells develops from a single cell embryo after fertilization. * Seminal discoveries towards understanding the molecular basis underlying somatic cell reprogramming and methodologies both in vitro and in vivo for the differentiation of human stem cells into various cells types, tissues and organoids. * Development of novel stem cell models of human aging and aging-associated diseases, and discovery of new drivers of aging. * Novel genetic and epigenetic technologies to both treat, and prevent the transmission, of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA originated diseases. Belmonte has over 450 publications describing these results. He has also received several awards and honors over the years, a notable one was the naming of a secondary school, Instituto Ense√±anza Secundaria (IES) Izpisua Belmonte, in his hometown of Hell√≠n, Albacete, Spain. In October, 2018, Belmonte was named by Time Magazine as one of the 50 Most Influential People in Healthcare of 2018. ==See also== * Xenotransplantation * Chimera (genetics) * Gene Therapy * Genome editing == References == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish biochemists ","title":"Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte"},{"id":"35186601","text":"The Sunderland Tramways Company operated a tramway service in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear between 1879 and 1901.The Golden Age of Tramways.

Ferr√© recorded with John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham, guitarist and drummer of Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Miroslav Vitous, bassist of Weather Report. For some reason, Ferr√© didn't use this version and re-recorded the track with Zoo, a young French band recently signed on his record label Barclay, going more destructured (irregular beat). In this manifesto song Ferr√© powerfully uses spoken word to claim his difference and reject societal hypocrisy. He sets to music several poems from his book Po√®te... vos papiers ! (songs Po√®te, vos papiers !, Les Passantes, Psaume 151, Le Crachat), that critics would praise as a truly renewal of his inspiration, without noticing these texts had been mostly written in the early 50s. Most of the \\"new\\" material is love songs, most of the time straightforward eroticized, except for Avec le temps (As time goes by), a tragic and beautifully sad love song inspired by his own disenchantment and the failure of his relationship with his second wife. It was dismissed from the original LP by his record label and was released on 45s one year later (it is included in the album since CD editions). This instant-classic is the most well-known of Ferr√©'s favorites, becoming with years the most constantly covered French song in France and worldwide. It topped a ranking established in 2012 by 276 contemporary French singers and musicians (and 69 critics) of the best French songs ever.

Sharp became chaplain to Archbishop William Dawes, a prebendary of Southwell Minster, and a member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding. He was also prebendary of Wistow in York Minster (29 April 1719), appointed rector of Rothbury, Northumberland in 1720, and collated archdeacon of Northumberland on 27 February 1722/3. He was created D.D. at Cambridge in 1729. On 1 December 1732 he was installed in the tenth prebend of Durham Cathedral at Durham, and in 1755 he succeeded Thomas Mangey as official to the dean and chapter of the cathedral. Sharp died at Durham on 16 March 1758, and was buried at the west end of the cathedral in the chapel called the Galilee. ==Works== His main works were: * A Vindication of Bishop Taylor from the injurious misrepresentation of him by the Author of the Letter to the Clergy of the Church of England in the county of Northumberland, 1733.

Occasioned by some Notions lately advanced in relation to them, London, 1751. Prompted by John Hutchinson and Alexander Stopford Catcott, this work elicited replies from Julius Bate and Benjamin Holloway, and these two writers were answered by Gy√∂rgy Kalm√°r, who defended Sharp. The latter issued a \\"review and defence\\" of the dissertations (pt. i. 1754, pt. ii. and iii. 1755). Sharp's works in this controversy were closely supervised by Thomas Secker. * The Rubric in the Book of Common Prayer and the Canons of the Church of England, so far as they relate to the Parochial Clergy, considered, London, 1753; 1787; Oxford, 1834 and 1853. * Discourses touching the antiquity of the Hebrew Tongue and Character, London, 1755. * Mr. Hutchinson's Exposition of Cherubim, and his Hypothesis concerning them examined, London, 1755.

Whilst still new students, Nick and his older brother, Anthony, began playing for church functions, fashion shows and family events in the late 1950s before traveling to the west coast. Nick's ethnic background is Italian-American and his grandparents came to the U.S from Naples, Italy. ==Education== Nick Ariondo's early talents were soon discovered when the family moved to California in the early 1960s, studying accordion with multi-instrumentalist Ford Bosman, with foremost classical accordionist Anthony Galla-Rini, with noted jazz accordionist Tommy Gumina and jazz saxophonist/flutist Buddy Collette and with classical pianist/lecturer/teacher Dr. Milton Stern. At age 16, Galla-Rini entered Ariondo into the Western States Accordion Festival, winning the Virtuoso Category performing Liszt's ‚ÄúRhapsody Espanol‚Äù while acquiring a Certificate of Merit for Artistic Services from the Los Angeles City Bureau of Music. In his early twenties, he attended Los Angeles City College, was elected to the Alfa Chapter of Epsilon Alpha Gamma and upon graduation, was presented the Hugo Davise Composition Award for his ‚ÄúString Quartet No.1‚Äù. Ariondo continued studying arranging, orchestration & composition at California State University at Los Angeles where in 1987, he received the Distinguished Music Alumnus Award from the CSULA Friends of Music. During his studies at CSULA, he was accepted into the piano and string master classes of concert pianist Dr. Milton Stern and string pedagogue Noumi Fischer where Ariondo transcribed, adapted and arranged music for accordion with piano, violin, viola, cello and string bass. In 1976 he received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music and four years later a Master of Arts Degree in composition and performance. The fulfillment of these degrees focused on performance which included Ariondo's original compositions and arrangements with special emphasis toward the utilization and integration of the accordion in chamber music settings. His masters thesis recital \\"Interaction and Integration of the Accordion in Chamber Music\\" encompassed a variety of music styles and genres from the baroque and classical to ragtime, gypsy, improvisational to the avant-garde mixed with accordion, strings, woodwinds and voices. Ariondo continued performing, composing and arranging while developing a vast repertoire for the years ahead. His work in the opera field with director/vocal coach Wendel Phillips led Ariondo into performing and arranging operatic arias and duets directly from the piano scores, accompanying a variety of singers in concert with accordion and small ensembles, a valuable learning experience into the world of operatic literature and understanding the vocal concept of accompaniment. ==Career== At the young age of 17, Ariondo was soloist and accompanist with pianist David Pinto in the Caf√© Russe Cabaret Theatre production in Hollywood, CA., performing with international singers and dancers of varied backgrounds and cultures. In the early 1970s, Ariondo was hired as the solo musician at Kavkaz Russian-Armenian Restaurant in West Hollywood, California, where he also accompanied Ariondo known international names Vigen Derderian (famous Persian- Armenian singer), Inna Miraeva (Russian Gypsy songstress), Lonia and Berta (Russian gypsies from Brazil), Rima Rudina and Hratch Yacoubian (international violinist/entertainers). It was during this time that Ariondo also worked with gypsy/classical violinist Shony Alex Braun, acting and performing as Shony's musical director in concert as well as appearing on his recordings. Ariondo toured with violinist Rima Rudina as a duo act concertizing in various parts of the U.S. and in 1974, 1978 and 1987 was a three-time winner of the International Grand Prix Competition sponsored by the Accordion Federation of North America. Throughout his career as accordionist and pianist, Ariondo developed a unique ability to reach out to diverse audiences of all ages and ethnic cultures, performing on keyboards in nightclubs and private functions. His astounding ‚Äòlive‚Äô concerts and videos on YouTubeSee Videos Category are a testament to his devotion and everlasting commitment to innovative accordion artistry. Hailed American composer Lukas Foss personally wrote Ariondo in 1988 saying, ‚ÄúI am impressed by your music, by the way you write for accordion and by your playing: so precise, so powerful.‚Äù Critics have referred to Ariondo as...\\"the Yehudi Menuhin of the accordion\\". The L.A. Times calls him the \\"Pre- eminent L.A. accordionist\\"....\\"the irrepressible avant-garde accordionist!‚Äù....\\"infinitely expressive, technically dazzling!\\"....\\"a force to be reckoned with!\\" Ariondo was featured onstage with Pl√°cido Domingo in L.A. Opera's World Premiere ‚ÄúIL Postino‚Äù by Daniel Cat√°n televised on PBS Great Performances and distributed on DVD by Sony Entertainment. The Artistry of Nick Ariondo has appeared ‚Äúlive‚Äù on radio stations throughout the West Coast, on cable television and KCET's Classic Arts Showcase. In 1987, after a standing ovation and a riveting performance of Nikolai Chaikin's Concerto for Accordion and Orchestra at UCLA‚Äôs Royce Hall, eminent conductor Zubin Mehta called Ariondo ‚Äúa brilliant success!‚Äù\\"Zubin Mehta:Nick Ariondo is a Brilliant Success\\" The Armenian Observer, Vol. XVII, No.18, April 1, 1987, by Edward Hosharian That same year Ariondo received the Distinguished Music Alumnus Award by CSULA‚Äôs Friends of Music for ‚Äúachievement and dedication to his musical craft.‚Äù Ariondo worked closely with Britain's acclaimed composer Thomas Ad√®s in the Los Angeles premiere of ‚ÄúPowder Her Face‚Äù and in 1990, received an Artists Fellowship Grant from the California Arts Council awarded to ‚Äúthose artists who have demonstrated exemplary professional achievement in their fields.‚Äù Ariondo's incomparable performances, original compositions and specialized arrangements in solo recital, in vocal/instrumental chamber music settings and as soloist with orchestra have gained him international attention. Guest television appearances include Dancing with the Stars, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson with violinist Nicola Benedetti and his music arrangements of Russian folk songs were featured in the Warren Beatty film ‚ÄúLove Affair‚Äù (Warner Bros.). His accordion performing can be heard on several film scores, including Rio 2, Knight and Day, Happy Feet Two, Bridesmaids and the Oscar-winning Life of Pi among a few.

Brightline began operating over its current route in January 2018 and the company is currently building an extension to the Orlando International Airport which is expected to enter service in 2022. , it is the only privately owned and operated intercity passenger railroad in the United States. The line was developed starting in March 2012 as All Aboard Florida by Florida East Coast Industries, a Florida real estate developer owned by Fortress Investment Group. Construction began in November 2014 on stations and improvements to tracks owned by the Florida East Coast Railway, which at the start of construction, was also owned by Fortress (it was sold in January 2018). Fortress Investment Group is also investing in the construction of Brightline West, a high speed rail route between Las Vegas and Southern California. The route is being advertised as ‚ÄúA Brightline Company.‚Äù In late 2018, it was announced that Virgin Group would become a minority investor in the railroad and would provide rights to rebrand the service as Virgin Trains USA. In August 2020, railroad managers announced that Virgin had not provided the agreed investment money and the company would be ending its branding deal, returning to the previous Brightline brand. ==Origins and history== Former All Aboard Florida logo Former Virgin Trains USA logo In 2012, Florida East Coast Industries (FECI) announced plans to operate passenger rail service between Miami and Orlando. The construction was projected at the time to be $1.5 billion. In March 2013, All Aboard Florida applied for a $1.6 billion Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan, which was administered by the Federal Railroad Administration, and in late 2014, the company applied for a $1.75 billion private activity bond allocation, with proceeds from the bond sale substantially reducing or replacing entirely the amount of the RRIF loan request. The company received a Finding of No Significant Impact from the Federal Railroad Administration in January 2013, effectively clearing way for work to begin between Miami and West Palm Beach. The Final Environmental Impact Statement was released on August 4, 2015. By the beginning of 2015, the company had started site work at the Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach stations, plus right of way improvements along stretches of the corridor. On November 10, 2015, All Aboard Florida announced that the service would operate under the name Brightline. Service between Miami and West Palm Beach began on May 19, 2018. In September 2018, Brightline acquired XpressWest, a private company that intends to connect Las Vegas with Southern California via Victorville, California. Brightline announced the intent of purchasing 38 acres of land near the Las Vegas Strip for a station and following the Interstate 15 corridor from Las Vegas to Southern California. In November 2018, it was announced that Virgin Group would become a minority investor in the railroad and would provide rights to rebrand the service as Virgin Trains USA. Two key counties on the coastal route north of the West Palm Beach station have, for various reasons, been fighting the extension of the rail line through Martin and Indian River Counties in court. One of their objections is that Brightline is owned by a private corporation, so they should not be allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds as if they were a municipality. On December 24, 2018, after four years of legal battles, a Federal District Judge threw out a suit by Indian River County that claimed the U.S. Department of Transportation improperly approved the bond allocation, clearing the way for construction of the new rail corridor through the Treasure Coast and Space Coast. On October 5, 2020, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of that decision, ending Indian River County's efforts to stymie development. The County's efforts at a Supreme Court hearing were financed with over $200,000 in private donations in addition to over $4 million in County funds. In April 2019, the company secured $1.75 billion in funding for the Orlando extension and said construction would begin right away. In August 2020, railroad managers announced that Virgin had not provided the agreed investment money and the company would be ending its branding deal, returning to the previous Brightline brand. Construction Miami Central in 2015 Brightline Train route map Construction began on the Miami to West Palm Beach section with the laying of new tracks and closure of the temporary surface lots in Government Center, Downtown Miami, in mid 2014. Preliminary work on the Miami station, such as site preparation and demolition, began later in the year. Suffolk Construction was the general contractor for the Miami station. Piles were being set on the four lots of MiamiCentral in early 2015. On October 29, 2014, work on the Fort Lauderdale station began with the demolition of existing buildings on the site. A groundbreaking ceremony for the West Palm Beach station was held in November 2014. Moss & Associates, of Fort Lauderdale, was the general contractor for the West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale stations. In January 2015, crews started replacing track throughout the corridor. All Aboard Florida secured leasing of easement rights alongside the Beachline from the Central Florida Expressway Authority for $1.4 million in December 2015. Construction work on Phase 2, between West Palm Beach and Orlando, officially began in June 2019, with a groundbreaking ceremony at Orlando International Airport. Preliminary work on the corridor began in September 2019, in the area of Jensen Beach and Sebastian, and begin path clearing for construction of the Orlando-to-Cocoa portion in October of that year.Virgin Trains rail construction to trigger Beachline Expressway nighttime closures, Rick Neale, Florida Today, 21 Oct 2019. , the contractors on the project were the Hubbard Construction Company, Wharton-Smith Inc., The Middlesex Corporation, Granite, and HSR Constructors. These five contractors are responsible for the development of 170 miles of new track into the completed state-of-the-art intermodal facility located in the new South Terminal at the Orlando International Airport (MCO). Opening Public operations between West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale began Saturday, January 13, 2018. Services between West Palm Beach and Miami began on May 19, 2018. Closing during the COVID-19 pandemic Brightline suspended operations on March 25, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company itself announced that the ridership has been triple to what had been expected. The forecast provided to bond investors calls for 240,000 passengers per month by 2020, which includes service to Miami, and analyst Fitch Ratings has said that the company could break even at 56% of their ridership forecast. By the end of 2018 almost 600,000 passengers had ridden the train, and the line welcomed its 1 millionth rider in August 2019. Ridership Years {  - ! Year !!

Rockwell Group designed the interiors. All three have adjacent parking garages that offer parking at the rate of $6 per day, eff. July 1, 2018. Miami Virgin MiamiCentral station entrance in 2018 The downtown Miami station, known as (not to be confused with Miami Central Station, now known as Miami Intermodal Center, near Miami International Airport), spans located just east of Miami-Dade County Hall and includes of mixed-use development with residential, office and commercial, and a retail concourse. The station connects Brightline with the Metrorail, Metromover, County bus and City of Miami trolley systems. The new Brightline station connects the following transit modes: 2 Metrorail stations, 2 Metromover stations, Metrobus, and the future Tri-Rail station. This increases connections to activities and tourist destinations, including the Performing Arts Center, Bayside Market and Bayfront Park. Service to Miami began on May 19, 2018. Fort Lauderdale Brightline Fort Lauderdale station The Fort Lauderdale station is located at NW 2nd Avenue between Broward Boulevard and NW 4th Street. The four-acre station site has a station and platform. The Brightline train service in Ft. Lauderdale connects to the Sun Trolley and Broward County Transit system. Brightline also owns about three acres of land to the east of the Florida East Coast Railway corridor, where there are plans to build a transit-oriented development. West Palm Beach West Palm Beach station The West Palm Beach station is located between Datura and Evernia Streets and to the west of Quadrille. The two-acre station site has a station and platform that connect with the neighborhood's existing vehicular, trolley and pedestrian networks and establish links to the Tri-Rail, Palm Tran Downtown Trolley and Amtrak West Palm Beach station. ==Planned & proposed routes and destinations== Orlando In 2017, the new Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal at Orlando International Airport was opened. Brightline will terminate at this station once the Orlando Extension is built. Tampa , Brightline is in negotiations with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) to lease right-of-way along the Interstate 4 corridor. Brightline was the only bidder to submit a proposal to construct an intercity rail line along Interstate 4, which has been designated for federally funded high-speed rail. This would be utilized for an extension of the line from Orlando International Airport to Tampa. Potential stops along this route are the SunRail Meadow Woods station, Walt Disney World, and Lakeland. The current deadline for the negotiations between Central Florida Expressway Authority, FDOT, and Virgin was March 31, 2020. In September 2020, the railroad entered into a memorandum of understanding with a local developer to potentiallly construct the terminal station in Ybor City. Jacksonville As part of the initial construction for what was then Brightline, All Aboard Florida said it was considering an extension to Jacksonville, Florida. Boca Raton In 2019, Brightline operations sent a letter to the city of Boca Raton about the possibility of adding their city as an infill station along the Florida route. Virgin proposed constructing the station and rail infrastructure while the city would cover access and zoning requirements and costs. In December 2019, Boca Raton was officially chosen as a station site with the station, to be connected to Mizner Park via pedestrian bridge. The station is scheduled to be completed in 2022. Aventura In October 2019, Miami-Dade County allocated $76 million to build Aventura station at the Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. At the time of the announcement, the projected opening date was October 2020. Groundbreaking on the station occurred in September 2020, with a new projected completion date in fall 2021.https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2020/09/03/brightline- breaks-ground-on-aventura-station.html PortMiami In October 2019, Brightline announced plans to start building a station in PortMiami in 2020. Future expansion Brightline has expressed interest in adding a station on Florida's Treasure Coast and another on the Space Coast between West Palm Beach and Orlando. In August 2018, the company asked cities in the area to submit proposals for station locations. Fort Pierce, which last had passenger train service on July 31, 1968, has expressed interest. The city of Stuart has also indicated that it will be negotiating for a potential station. Brightline has indicated that Stuart is the most likely location for a Treasure Coast station, and that Cocoa would make the most sense for a Space Coast station, both because of proximity to Port Canaveral's cruise lines as well as for positioning for future expansion to Jacksonville. Neither station has been committed in writing, and both are pending market studies, as completion of the line to Orlando is the top priority for Brightline. In 2020, it was revealed that Brightline was planning a commuter rail service to complement the higher-speed line. Trains would run between Miami Central and Aventura with up to five stations between. ==Brightline West== On September 18, 2018, Fortress Investment Group announced that it would acquire XpressWest, a venture capital proposal to build a privately funded high-speed rail passenger train from Apple Valley, California to Las Vegas, Nevada from hotel developer Marnell Corrao Associates. When Fortress subsequently entered into its partnership with Virgin Group in 2019, it was announced that the newly formed consortium will build and operate XpressWest when it opens. In September 2020, Fortress Investment Group renamed the project Brightline West. ==Engineering== Train speeds Upon full buildout of the Miami‚ÄìOrlando route, trains will operate at up to between Miami and West Palm Beach, up to between West Palm Beach and Cocoa, and up to between Cocoa and the Orlando International Airport. A future extension to Tampa from Orlando would, if constructed, also allow trains to operate at up to . It will be one of the few rail services in the United States to approach the UIC's high-speed rail standard of for new rail or for existing lines. The planned travel time between Miami and Orlando is 3 hours. Driving between the two takes hours using the Florida's Turnpike, and hours using the I-95/SR 528 freeways along the planned train route via Cocoa. The flight time between MIA and MCO is one hour. To meet the 3 hour schedule, trains will have to operate with an overall average speed of , which is similar to the overall average speed of the Acela Express operating on the Northeast Corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C. Pre-existing Miami‚ÄìCocoa Corridor upgrades The project calls for more than $1.5 billion in upgrades to the rail corridor between Miami and Cocoa. The company is double tracking the corridor, improving signaling systems, and upgrading every grade crossing to meet the highest applicable safety standards set by FDOT and Federal Railroad Administration. In January 2013, the Federal Railroad Administration issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the Miami‚ÄìCocoa phase of the project, effectively clearing the way for work to begin. Part of the corridor safety upgrades includes installing positive train control (PTC), which will enhance Brightline's ability to monitor and control train movements safely. Quiet zones Responding to citizen concerns about increased noise from additional horns, the company stated that it will work with local communities to implement quiet zones where possible. Federal law requires quiet zone requests to originate from the local authority that has jurisdiction over the roadway, not the railroad company. In August 2014, the company announced a partnership with the Broward and Palm Beach Metropolitan Planning Organizations to implement quiet zones between the city of Hallandale Beach and 15th Street in West Palm Beach. In December 2014, the Miami-Dade Metropolitan Planning Organization approved funding to construct quiet zones between PortMiami and the northern Miami-Dade County line. The quiet zones were originally planned to be in place when Brightline becomes operational between Miami and West Palm Beach by the end of 2017. Brightline started service on January 11, 2018, but various delays in constructing the quiet zones have stretched their in-service date to sometime in March. On May 14, 2018, quiet zones went into effect in West Palm Beach, in Lake Worth on May 21 and in Boca Raton on May 30. The ‚Äúno train horn‚Äù areas apply to all trains, freight and passenger. Quiet Zones remove the legal duty of a train engineer to sound the horn. Train engineers do still use the horn in quiet zones for emergency situations (such as a trespasser fouling the tracks ). Bridges The FEC rail corridor includes a number of fixed-span bridges that will be replaced as part of the project. Most do not require United States Coast Guard (USCG) permitting as they do not span significant navigable waterways and clearances will not change. Twelve other bridges‚ÄîSt. Johns River, Eau Gallie River, St. Sebastian River, Crane Creek, Turkey Creek, West Palm Beach Canal, Boynton Canal, Middle River (both the North and South Fork), Oleta River, Arch Creek and Hillsboro Canal‚Äîwill require permitting by the USCG. In addition, the project calls for significant investment and upgrades to three movable bridges: St. Lucie, Loxahatchee, and New River. These improvements will ensure that bridge mechanical systems for raising and lowering the bridge spans are either fully upgraded or replaced. The company has stated that, prior to it becoming operational, it will start to regularly notify mariners of scheduled bridge closings via the internet, smart phone application and countdown signage on the bridges to enable mariners to have real-time information to decrease wait times at each bridge. Also, the company will station a bridge tender at the New River bridge. Deaths During the first six days of operation, two people were killed in separate incidents at railroad crossings along the line, after they attempted to cross the tracks while the gates were down. During the first three months of operation, four people were killed by a Brightline train when they crossed the tracks illegally, with an additional three persons injured. The 11th fatality associated with a Brightline train occurred on January 1, 2019, after a pedestrian was struck and thrown into a canal.\\"Man's body recovered from canal after collision with Brightline train\\", South Florida Sun-Sentinel, January 1, 2019. As of November 16, 2019, according to the advocacy group Alliance for Safe Trains, a total of 34 people had been killed in incidents involving Virgin Trains locomotives in Florida, although those include what are likely to have been suicides.Brightline and Tri-Rail Have Killed Dozens, Meg O'Connor, Miami New Times, 19 Feb 2019. In December 2019, the AP produced a story based on FRA data that Virgin Trains USA had the worst per-mile death rate of the nation's 821 railroads. It stated that none of the deaths were the fault of the company. Cocoa‚ÄìOrlando The proposed line between Cocoa and Orlando is the only segment that does not have existing track or right-of-way owned by FEC. Originally, the Central Florida Expressway Authority (CFX) believed it could accommodate building new tracks for the project within the BeachLine Expressway's wide right-of-way. This segment of the proposed line will operate at speeds of up to . CFX began negotiations with Deseret Ranch, which owns the land just south of the BeachLine, to purchase additional land in order to widen the right-of-way. According to a pact made on July 16, 2013, CFX tentatively agreed to pay $12 million for an extra along the BeachLine corridor between Cocoa and Orlando International Airport. In early October 2013, CFX and All Aboard Florida reached a formal purchase agreement for the land required for the right-of-way. Although construction was slated to originally begin in early 2015, construction of the segment started on May 22, 2019. Also in October 2013, the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) board approved development of a station and maintenance facility on Orlando International Airport property, as well as an easement to build track between the station and the mainline to the coast. Maintenance Brightline is constructing two maintenance facilities. One is a Running Repair Facility, located north of the West Palm Beach station at 601 15th Street, designed for maintenance and minor repair work that does not require the train to be removed from service. The 12-acre site has been under construction since at least January 2016. The land includes vintage industrial buildings that will be renovated for the workshop. The facility, named \\"workshop b,\\" will include a maintenance pit for access to the underside of the trains and will be able to handle four 10-car train sets. More extensive maintenance/repair will be accomplished at a second site near the Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal. ==Technical== Rolling stock All Aboard Florida ordered of five Siemens trainsets in 2014. Each Brightline trainset initially consisted of four passenger coaches, with a Siemens Charger SCB-40 diesel- electric locomotive on each end. The coaches, with interiors designed by the LAB at Rockwell Group, feature ergonomic seating, Wi-Fi, level boarding, and meet ADA compliance standards. Each trainset holds 248 passengers. Working with All Aboard Florida, the LAB also conceived the Brightline name, brand platform, and visual identity. The entire trainset, including passenger cars, were manufactured by Siemens in its solar-powered plant in Florin, California. Once the route to Orlando is in operation, the trainsets will be expanded to seven coaches, and five more complete trainsets will be purchased. The first of five trainsets departed the Siemens factory on December 8, 2016, and arrived in West Palm Beach on December 14. The fifth trainset arrived in South Florida in October 2017. The trains offers two classes of service, with one \\"Select\\" coach and three \\"Smart\\" coaches on each trainset. \\"Select\\" offers 2x1 and four-to-a-table seating with 50 -wide seats per car and complimentary snacks and beverages, while the slightly less expensive \\"Smart\\" fare coaches seat 66 with narrower -wide seats, with snacks and beverages available for purchase. Each trainset is able to hold 248 passengers. {  - !Photo !Year !Model !Total !Power !Weight -  rowspan=\\"2\\" frameless 2017 Siemens Charger SCB-40 locomotives 10 units   - 2017 Siemens Venture trainsets 5 trainsets of 4 cars (20 cars total)https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single- view/view/brightline-unveils-siemens-locomotives-and-coaches.html unpowered TBD } ==See also== *Transportation in Florida *Transportation in South Florida *Florida high speed rail ==References * *All Aboard Florida ‚Äì Miami to Orlando Passenger Rail Service ‚Äì Federal Railroad Administration Category:2018 establishments in Florida Category:Florida East Coast Railway Category:Higher-speed rail Category:Passenger rail transportation in Florida Category:Proposed railway lines in Florida Category:Railway services introduced in 2018 Category:Virgin Trains ","title":"Brightline"},{"id":"35186985","text":"Bahramabad (, also Romanized as BahrƒÅmƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Basharyat-e Sharqi Rural District, Basharyat District, Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It utilizes several wavetables and oscillators in the creation of synthetic timbres. The software can be used as a VST plugin within a digital audio workstation, or as a standalone program. Released in 2007, the plugin has gained widespread popularity in the electronic music field, and is one of the most popular synthesizer plugins for modern dance music production. ==Synthesis== Massive features a hybrid digital-analog design which is intended for the production of bass and lead sounds. Based on wavetable synthesis, the plugin‚Äôs sound is formed by three wave oscillators with separate controls for wavetable position, pitch, and wave shaping. The sound created from these oscillators can be driven through two separate filters. Onwards, the sound in output is shaped with four different envelopes, which feature settings for attack, decay, release and sustain, and these can be set individually for any knob in the plugin interface. Modulation settings include LFO, Performer and Stepper options. ==Expansions== In August 2018 Native Instruments announced a new line of expansion packs for Massive called Massive Expansions. Each expansion comes loaded with 150 customizable presets tailored towards a specific genre or mood.

PP 285/580 Le Grutl√©en., 1909.10.15-1917.12.28 (S√©rie) It became a daily newspaper on 1 April 1919. In 1925 the two newspapers signed a cooperation treaty, and whilst maintaining separate identities and local pages the two newspapers would share national and international articles. After the association of the two newspapers, L√©on Nicole served as their editor.Jeanneret, Pierre. Popistes: histoire du Parti ouvrier et populaire vaudois, 1943-2001. Lausanne: √âd. d'en Bas, 2002. pp. 334-335 Politically Nicole had a hegemonic influence over the newspapers. From 1925 onwards the two newspapers were published by the Socialist Press Union of the Cantons of Geneva and Vaud and they were printed by Imprimeries Populaires. From 1936 both papers were printed in Geneva. As Le Peuple Valaisan disappeared in 1936, Le Droit du Peuple became the de facto socialist organ in Bas-Valais as well. When the Swiss Socialist Party split in 1939, Le Travail and Le Droit du Peuple became organs of the Swiss Socialist Federation.Cantini, Claude, and Charles Heimberg. Pour une histoire sociale et antifasciste: contributions d'un autodidacte. Lausanne: Ed. d'En Bas [u.a.], 1999. p. 146 But the enemies of Nicole were in control of the Imprimeries Populaires printing press and refused to print Le Travail and Le Droit du People. Instead the newspapers had to seek cooperation with small private printing presses in order to continue publication. The 22 sections of the Socialist Party of Geneva set up a cooperative in October 1939, for the sake of purchasing printing equipment. In early 1940 a building, to be used for the printing press, was purchased. Both Le Travail and Le Droit du Peuple were banned on 5 July 1940. ==References== Category:Defunct newspapers published in Switzerland Category:French-language newspapers published in Switzerland Category:Mass media in Geneva ","title":"Le Travail-Le Droit du Peuple"},{"id":"35187132","text":"Khatayan () may refer to: *Khatayan, Qazvin *Khatayan, Razavi Khorasan ","title":"Khatayan"},{"id":"35187141","text":"Yaqubabad (, also Romanized as Ya‚Äòq≈´bƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Basharyat-e Sharqi Rural District, Basharyat District, Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Self-written, produced by Labrinth and co-produced by Marc Williams and featuring a sample from the Stevie Wonder song \\"As\\". The song was released on 8 May 2011 as Yasmin's second single. ==Background== \\"Finish Line\\" came about after Yasmin was in studio with her friend, Labrinth in January 2010. The two struggled for eight hours before beginning work on the song. Yasmin originally wrote and composed the whole song acoustically before Labrinth begun production work on it. Yasmin has revealed that it took about thirty minutes for her to write the song. The song was co-produced by Labrinth's manager, Marc Williams. The song resulted in Yasmin becoming Level Entertainment's first signed artist after she played \\"Finish Line\\" to the label's co-director and BBC Radio 1Xtra presenter, Twin B. In mid February 2011, a snippet of the final studio version of \\"Finish Line\\" was released onto the internet after Yasmin performed the song live at various gigs. The official radio edit for the song was then uploaded on 14 March 2011. On 20 April, \\"Finish Line\\" was A-listed on BBC Radio 1. Remixes of \\"Finish Line\\" by Freemasons, Mike Delinquent and Shy FX were also released. In an interview with SoulCulture, Yasmin explained how the Freemasons Remix came about as well as her opinion of the remix: > I suggested the Freemasons when discussing remix ideas with the label and > luckily for me the guys loved the song and went right ahead making an > incredible floorfiller-esque remix, [...], the guys told me they were so > inspired by the track they wanted to do an alternative afterhours chilled > out version which I was more than happy for them to do considering the > calibre of the uptempo mix. When I finally heard this Afterhours Mix, I was > blown away, it's even more magical than I expected. This remix has some of > the most beautiful and evoking production I've heard in a long time, reminds > me so much of Massive Attack and Portishead, they just really nailed it. ==Critical reception== \\"Finish Line\\" has been positively reviewed by music critics. Ciar√°n Gaynor of State.ie said that \\"Finish Line\\" proves many wrong who say that pop music is all the same. Gaynor complimented the song's good tune and sharp production. He went on to describe the drum sound on the track as \\"ace\\" and also highlighted: \\"'Finish Line' is not auto-tuney, and not full of those bright David Guetta house sounds that people complain about and so it's something of a bit of fresh air.\\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy praised how \\"Finish Line\\", unlike most break-up songs, is able to dress up a break-up as a cool and sophisticated pop track, \\"a feat too great for even the most established of artists.\\" Copsey went on to describe the song's synths as \\"heart warming\\" and Yasmin's vocals as \\"radio-friendly\\". Cameron Rawson from Sound Of The Day was impressed by Yasmin's \\"soft tone\\" and \\"vibrant voice\\" on the song. Rawson felt Labrinth's hard work paid off in the \\"sweet production\\" on the record. He also highlighted: \\"If this is the sort of quality Yasmin is releasing now, in a few years time she will be huge - mark my words.\\" Nyasha Edwards of Urban Development felt that \\"Finish Line\\" shows a more softer, mildly sentimental side to Yasmin than her previous single, \\"On My Own\\", did. ==Chart performance== \\"Finish Line\\" first charted on 15 May 2011, when it debuted at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart; marking Yasmin's highest charting single to date. The single also debuted at number-one on the UK Indie Chart, knocking \\"Unorthodox\\" by Wretch 32 from the summit. On its second week charting, the single fell 7 places to number 20; falling a further 10 places to number 30 on 29 May. \\"Finish Line\\" spent only a single week at the summit of the independent chart, with Adele returning to the top spot on 22 May with \\"Someone Like You\\". ==Live performances== Yasmin performed \\"Finish Line\\" in January 2011 in an acoustic session for The Sun's 'The Biz Sessions'. She also performed \\"On My Own\\" and a cover of Ellie Goulding's \\"Starry Eyed\\" (2010). \\"Finish Line\\" was also performed by Yasmin when she was the supporting act for British artists Example's 2010 tour, and Eliza Doolittle's 2011 tour of the United Kingdom. ==Track listing== *;Digital download #\\"Finish Line\\" (Radio Edit) ‚Äì 3:59 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemasons Pegasus Club Mix) ‚Äì 9:23 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Mike Delinquent Project Remix) ‚Äì 4:29 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Shy's Smoking Rabbit Mix) ‚Äì 4:48 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemasons Pegasus After Hours Mix) ‚Äì 6:01 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Acoustic Mix) ‚Äì 4:02 *;12\\" (I) #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemasons Pegasus Club Mix) ‚Äì 9:23 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemasons Pegasus Dub) ‚Äì 8:46 *;12\\" (II) #\\"Finish Line\\" (Mike Delinquent Project Remix) ‚Äì 4:29 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Shy's Smoking Rabbit Mix) ‚Äì 4:48 *;\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemason's Pegasus Radio Edit) - single #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemason's Pegasus Radio Edit) - 3:25 *;Promo CD singlehttp://www.discogs.com/Yasmin-Finish-Line/release/2914619 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Radio Edit) ‚Äì 3:59 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemasons Pegasus Club Mix) ‚Äì 9:23 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Mike Delinquent Project Remix) ‚Äì 4:29 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Shy's Smoking Rabbit Mix) ‚Äì 4:48 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Pegasus After Hours Mix) ‚Äì 6:01 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Freemason's Pegasus Radio Edit) - 3:25 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Original Extended Edit) - 4:50 #\\"Finish Line\\" (Instrumental Edit) - 3:57 ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2011) !!

By the time they return to Bristol, everything has changed...http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/4od#3279061 ==Plot== The gang are on holiday in Marrakesh, Morocco in a run-down villa, where they have found weed under the floorboards. On the first night, Alo finds them a party at a nearby villa owned by a boy called Luke, who is also from England. Franky, unhappy in her relationship with Matty, finds herself drawn to Luke. The following morning, Alo is seduced by Mini, but she swears him to secrecy about their encounter. Later, Luke and his mate Jake visit the gang and reveal they've been using the villa to stash weed. Luke forgives the gang for smoking it, but tells them he needs the rest back and invites them to a beach party. Once there, Luke asks Franky to run away with him. Mini and Alo decide to continue hooking up on the condition of complete secrecy. Jake taunts Matty about Luke and Franky's possible involvement and gives Matty a way to stop it: smuggle six kilogrammes of weed into Marrakesh. Meanwhile, a Moroccan man named Mahmut warns Liv that Luke is very dangerous, and Liv watches as Franky gets into Luke's car. Matty gets into the smuggling car and watches them drive away. Grace joins him, wanting to talk, but Liv rushes up and demands they follow Franky and Luke. The chase becomes dangerously fast, and an oncoming truck forces Matty to swerve over the edge of the road. The car lands on its top and rolls over, nearly destroyed. As Liv emerges from the rubble and Grace lies motionless and bloody on the hood, Matty runs away from the scene to avoid being arrested for the possession of the marijuana which Luke placed inside his vehicle. Three weeks later, Grace is in hospital in a coma, Matty has disappeared and is wanted by the police, and the rest of the gang seem to have rejected Franky. Nick asks Mini why Matty won't call, and she replies that his brother loves Franky more than him. Shortly after, Nick ignores a call from Matty. Rich attempts to bring a CD and flowers to Grace, but Professor David Blood has forbidden the nurses from allowing Rich to visit. The nurse plays the CD for Grace, who is still unconscious and hooked to a respirator. The song is one she had previously recorded vocals on, which Rich and Alo finished for her after the accident. ==References== Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes Category:2012 British television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Morocco ","title":"Everyone (Skins series 6)"},{"id":"35187509","text":"The motor size constant (K_\\\\text{M}) and motor velocity constant (K_\\\\text{v}, alternatively called the back EMF constant) are values used to describe characteristics of electrical motors. == Motor constant== K_\\\\text{M} is the motor constanthttp://www.motioncomp.com/pdfs/Motor_Constant_Great_Equalizer.pdf (sometimes, motor size constant). In SI units, the motor constant is expressed in newton metres per square root watt (\\\\text{N}{}\\\\cdot{}\\\\text{m} / \\\\sqrt{\\\\text{W}}): : K_\\\\text{M} = \\\\frac{\\\\tau}{\\\\sqrt{P}} where * \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tau is the motor torque (SI unit: newton‚Äìmetre) * \\\\scriptstyle P is the resistive power loss (SI unit: watt) The motor constant is winding independent (as long as the same conductive material is used for wires); e.g., winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant, K_\\\\text{v}, but K_\\\\text{M} remains unchanged. K_\\\\text{M} can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application. K_\\\\text{v} can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor. Since the torque \\\\tau is current I multiplied by K_\\\\text{T} then K_\\\\text{M} becomes : K_\\\\text{M} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\text{T} I}{\\\\sqrt{P}} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\text{T} I }{\\\\sqrt{I^2 R}} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\text{T}}{\\\\sqrt{R}} where * I is the current (SI unit, ampere) * R is the resistance (SI unit, ohm) * K_\\\\text{T} is the motor torque constant (SI unit, newton‚Äìmetre per ampere, N¬∑m/A), see below If two motors with the same K_\\\\text{v} and torque work in tandem, with rigidly connected shafts, the K_\\\\text{v} of the system is still the same assuming a parallel electrical connection. The K_\\\\text{M} of the combined system increased by \\\\sqrt{2}, because both the torque and the losses double. Alternatively, the system could run at the same torque as before, with torque and current split equally across the two motors, which halves the resistive losses. == Motor velocity constant, back EMF constant == K_\\\\text{v} is the motor velocity, or motor speed, constant (not to be confused with kV, the symbol for kilovolt), measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) per volt or radians per volt second, rad/V¬∑s:http://learningrc.com/motor-kv/ : K_\\\\text{v} = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\text{no-load}}{V_\\\\text{peak}} The K_\\\\text{v} rating of a brushless motor is the ratio of the motor's unloaded rotational speed (measured in RPM) to the peak (not RMS) voltage on the wires connected to the coils (the back EMF). For example, an unloaded motor of supplied with 11.1 V will run at a nominal speed of 63,270 rpm (= 5,700 rpm/V √ó 11.1 V). Actually, the motor may not reach this theoretical speed because there are non-linear mechanical losses. On the other hand, if the motor is driven as a generator, the no-load voltage between terminals is perfectly proportional to the RPM and true to the K_\\\\text{v} of the motor/generator. The terms K_\\\\text{e}, K_\\\\text{b} are also used, as are the terms back EMF constant, or the generic electrical constant. In contrast to K_\\\\text{v} the value K_\\\\text{e} is often expressed in SI units volt‚Äìseconds per radian (V‚ãÖs/rad), thus it is an inverse measure of K_v.http://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/tech- blog/2014/02/02/reading-the-motor-constants-from-typical-performance- characteristics Sometimes it is expressed in non SI units volts per kilorevolution per minute (V/krpm).http://www.smma.org/pdf/SMMA_motor_glossary.pdf : K_\\\\text{e} = K_\\\\text{b} = \\\\frac{V_\\\\text{peak}}{\\\\omega_\\\\text{no-load}} = \\\\frac{1}{K_\\\\text{v}} The field flux may also be integrated into the formula: : K_\\\\omega = \\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{\\\\phi\\\\omega} where E_\\\\text{b} is back EMF, K_\\\\omega is the constant, \\\\phi is the flux, and \\\\omega is the angular velocity. By Lenz's law, a running motor generates a back-EMF proportional to the speed. Once the motor's rotational velocity is such that the back-EMF is equal to the battery voltage (also called DC line voltage), the motor reaches its limit speed. == Motor torque constant == K_\\\\text{T} is the torque produced divided by armature current. It can be calculated from the motor velocity constant K_\\\\text{v}. : K_\\\\text{T} = \\\\frac{\\\\tau}{I_\\\\text{a}} = \\\\frac{60}{2\\\\pi K_\\\\text{v(RPM)}} = \\\\frac{1}{K_\\\\text{v(SI)}} where I_\\\\text{a} is the armature current of the machine (SI unit: ampere). K_\\\\text{T} is primarily used to calculate the armature current for a given torque demand: : I_\\\\text{a} = \\\\frac{\\\\tau}{K_\\\\text{T}} The SI units for the torque constant are newton metres per ampere (N¬∑m/A). Since 1 N¬∑m = 1 J, and 1 A = 1 C/s, then 1 N¬∑m/A = 1 J¬∑s/C = 1 V¬∑s (same units as back EMF constant). The relationship between K_\\\\text{T} and K_\\\\text{v} is not intuitive, to the point that many people simply assert that torque and K_\\\\text{v} are not related at all. An analogy with a hypothetical linear motor can help to convince that it is true. Suppose that a linear motor has a K_\\\\text{v} of 2 (m/s)/V, that is, the linear actuator generates one volt of back-EMF when moved (or driven) at a rate of 2 m/s. Conversely, s = VK_\\\\text{v} (s is speed of the linear motor, V is voltage). The useful power of this linear motor is P = VI, P being the power, V the useful voltage (applied voltage minus back-EMF voltage), and I the current. But, since power is also equal to force multiplied by speed, the force F of the linear motor is F = P/(VK_\\\\text{v}) or F = I/K_\\\\text{v}. The inverse relationship between force per unit current and K_\\\\text{v} of a linear motor has been demonstrated. To translate this model to a rotating motor, one can simply attribute an arbitrary diameter to the motor armature e.g. 2 m and assume for simplicity that all force is applied at the outer perimeter of the rotor, giving 1 m of leverage. Now, supposing that K_\\\\text{v} (angular speed per unit voltage) of the motor is 3600 rpm/V, it can be translated to \\"linear\\" by multiplying by 2œÄ m (the perimeter of the rotor) and dividing by 60, since angular speed is per minute. This is linear K_\\\\text{v} \\\\approx 377\\\\ (\\\\text{m} / \\\\text{s}) / \\\\text{V}. Now, if this motor is fed with current of 2 A and assuming that back-EMF is exactly 2 V, it is rotating at 7200 rpm and the mechanical power is 4 W, and the force on rotor is N or 0.0053 N. The torque on shaft is 0.0053 N‚ãÖm at 2 A because of the assumed radius of the rotor (exactly 1 m). Assuming a different radius would change the linear K_\\\\text{v} but would not change the final torque result. To check the result, remember that P = \\\\tau\\\\, 2\\\\pi\\\\, \\\\omega / 60. So, a motor with K_\\\\text{v} = 3600\\\\text{ rpm} / \\\\text{V} = 377\\\\text{ rad} / \\\\text{V¬∑s} will generate 0.00265 N‚ãÖm of torque per ampere of current, regardless of its size or other characteristics. This is exactly the value estimated by the K_\\\\text{T} formula stated earlier. ==References * Category:Electric motors ","title":"Motor constants"},{"id":"35187517","text":"Anjilaq (, also Romanized as Anjƒ´lƒÅq and An·∏©ƒ´lƒÅq) is a village in Kuhpayeh-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The general mood here is dark, both exasperated and desperate. ==History== After having inserted two symphonic songs (\\"Ton style\\", \\"Tu ne dis jamais rien\\") in his mostly pop rock oriented album La Solitude (1971), after having re-recorded his 1950s oratorio on Guillaume Apollinaire's vast poem La Chanson du mal-aim√© (\\"Song of the Poorly Loved\\", 1972), Ferr√© feels now ready to establish himself as a complete artist, author and musician, who will do without any arrangers' services from now. So here he goes completely symphonic with his own material for the first time (he had gone orchestral before with arranger Jean-Michel Defaye but it was mostly on renowned material by French poets from the 19th century - see Verlaine et Rimbaud and L√©o Ferr√© chante Baudelaire albums) and he often replaces singing by intense spoken-word and declamation. This very cohesive album opens with the straightforward manifesto \\"Preface\\", a reduction of a much longer text that precisely prefaces Po√®te... vos papiers! (Poet... your documents!), a collection of his poems formerly published in January 1957. As Ferr√© says, \\"the most beautiful songs are songs that demand justice\\". The discipline of poetry is meant to teach us how to fight so we can free our mind: The album ends with the radical, pessimistic yet epic and fighting \\"Il n'y a plus rien\\" (\\"There is no more\\"), that deals with libertarian and revolutionary utopias disappointment from the 1960s and May 68. This anarchist outburst is an example of one of the first uses of whale vocalization in popular music. ==Track listing== All songs written, composed, arranged and directed by L√©o Ferr√©, except Ne chantez pas la mort whose text is written by Jean-Roger Caussimon. ;Original LP == Credits == * Danielle Licari: voice * The orchestra consists of session musicians hired for the recording * Arranger & orchestra conductor: L√©o Ferr√© * Director of engineering: Claude Achall√© * Engineers: Charles Rochko, Philippe Omnes * Executive producer: Richard Marsan * Artwork: Patrick Ullmann, Genevi√®ve Vanhaecke == External links == * English translation of Night and day. * Album presentation (French) == References == Category:L√©o Ferr√© albums Category:French-language albums Category:Barclay Records albums Category:1973 albums ","title":"Il n'y a plus rien"},{"id":"35187645","text":"Aruna Beth Abrams (born January 16, 1975)Result on the familysearch.org website that lists her date of birth, (accessed December 7, 2014) is an American singer, songwriter, DJ, producer, and pianist. She is best known as a vocalist in dance music since 2007 and a DJ/producer since 2011. She resides in Los Angeles, California. ==Early life and career== Aruna grew up in Flemington, New Jersey, the daughter of Beatrice and Larry S. Abrams, a clinical pharmaceutical researcher.Larry S. Abrams listing on Biomedexperts.com, (accessed December 6, 2014) Her name was suggested by her Indian godfather and means \\"sunrise\\" in Hindi. She began studying classical piano and later, jazz improvisation, and left her hometown to study piano as well as film scoring and electronic music production at the Berklee College of Music, Boston. In 1996 she worked on the 'Portal' project together with members of the progressive metal band Cynic, providing vocals and keyboards.Discogs.com entry for The Portal Tapes, (accessed December 7, 2014). This material was eventually released in 2012 as The Portal Tapes, under the Cynic name.Bandcamp listing for the Portal Tapes compilation album, (accessed December 7, 2014). At Berklee, Abrams was taught music production, audio editing and sounds design, while she graduated in 1999.Listing under 1999 Berklee Today - Alumnotes, (accessed December 7, 2014) Growing up, Abrams listened mostly to 70s and 80s pop, which changed when 'my tastes started diversifying and I got into hair, thrash and death metal as a teen'. She first began performing as an acoustic singer-songwriter at local coffee houses in Boston,SoundClick artist: Aruna listing and interview, (accessed, December 7, 2014). and recorded the three-song demo Broken Circles, produced by Alain Mallet and mixed by Kevin Killen. In 2000 she was selected as the opening act for the Boston show of The Girls Room Tour showcase. After graduating college, Abrams relocated to Los Angeles. In 2004, she recorded and self-released her first full-length album, Running Red Lights. While pursuing a career as a pop singer-songwriter, Aruna saw some early success when a number of her songs were featured on the MTV shows, Laguna Beach and The Hills. An even bigger break came when she co-wrote a song for Miley Cyrus entitled ‚ÄúI Got Nerve‚Äù for the 2006 #1 Billboard album, the Hannah Montana: Season One soundtrack. ==EDM vocals and songwriting career== In 2006, she was discovered through MySpace by her manager Stuart Squires, who began pitching her for dance collaborations. Six months later, Abrams was approached by The Thrillseekers to feature her vocals on a track. The collaboration was her introduction into the EDM world, supplying the track ‚ÄúWaiting Here For You‚Äù. She has continued to work with other trance acts, including Cosmic Gate, ATB, Ronski Speed and Roger Shah. Together with Mark Eteson she recorded the single ‚ÄúLet Go‚Äù, which was released on October 25, 2010 through the Anjunabeats label and later included on theVolume 8 compilation from the same label.Listing on Discogs.com for the Let Go release, (accessed December 7, 2014). Two years later the single ‚ÄúLive Forever‚Äù with Ferry Corsten was released and featured on the album WKND.Allmusic.com entry for WKND, (accessed December 8, 2014). She also appeared in her first video for the song. In 2013 she went on to collaborate with Armin van Buuren on \\"Won‚Äôt Let You Go\\" for his artist album Intense. On these collaborations she noted that 'writing my own lyrics and melodies is and has always been a non-negotiable. I just can't sell a song I didn't write in the quite same way'. In the beginning of 2009, she was contacted by Myon (Mario Egeto) of DJ duo Myon & Shane 54 to work together on a track. After releasing ‚ÄúHelpless,‚Äù both parties had ideas for track collaborations that didn't fit into their own artist personas, so the trio formed a new side project that they dubbed Velvetine. ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù was the first original track released by Velvetine in 2010 on Anjunabeats Volume 7 and was warmly received by fans and by Armin van Buuren, who crafted an intro mix for it and a mashup version with his track, ‚ÄúFace to Face‚Äù. Velvetine's second single ‚ÄúThe Great Divide‚Äù was released in 2012, reached #1 on the Beatport trance and dubstep charts and first played by Armin on A State of Trance #573. ==DJing career== In 2011, Abrams decided to move into DJing, and has credited Myon & Shane 54 as the inspiration for her to make the transition. She started her own radio show, The Hot List in September 2011on DI.fm. In August 2012, she became the first solo female act to do a guest mix for Above & Beyond‚Äôs Trance Around the World radio show. Afterwards, The Hot List reached #14 on the iTunes Top 200 Music Podcasts chart. Touted by Tony McGuiness of Above & Beyond as \\"one of the most talented singer/songwriters around at the moment\\". Aruna joined Above & Beyond for a second time in November 2013, doing a guest mix for their podcast, Group Therapy. In 2012, Aruna performed on the ‚ÄúA State of Pink‚Äù stage at Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance 550 festival in Den Bosch, Netherlands. A year later, she accompanied Armin with live vocals during his set at the Hollywood Palladium in LA. She has also performed live at Nocturnal Wonderland, Avalon Hollywood alongside Ferry Corsten and at Exchange LA with Myon & Shane54. She has performed live vocals and DJ sets internationally. Abrams moved to the UK-based record label Enhanced Recordings in 2013.Listing on the Enhanced Records website, (accessed December 8, 2014). Her solo track ‚ÄúReason to Believe‚Äù was her first single with the label and reached the #3 position on the Beatport Trance chart in August 2013. Remixes to ‚ÄúReason to Believe‚Äù peaked at #7 and #9 in the Glitch Hop and Chillout charts, the latter a mix she self-produced. In 2014, Abrams released Amsterdam Enhanced together with AWD. In November 2016, she released the single \\"Ready To Go\\" with English music producer Rameses B featuring American vocalist Kingd√∏ms on Monstercat. == Style == Abrams 'went through the requisite Lilith phase' in college listening to mostly female artist such as Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan. It began to influence most of her writing and 'it was around that time that I really began consciously honing my craft'. During her career, Abrams has written a large number of trance tracks where she found herself 'limited by their structure, and also the imagery that they impose from a lyrical perspective, since the tracks and the sounds in trance are so big and lush and epic, the lyrics kinda have to follow suit, so they end up being somewhat abstract'. In general, her method of working centres on the melody before the lyrics are written. In contrast Abrams preferred 'the intimacy of pop lyric writing and arrangements, which allow the melody and the story of the song to be the main focus, not the kick drum and the lead lines'. ==Discography== ;EPs *2001: Broken Circles ;Albums * 2004: Running Red Lights ;Featured singles * 2007: The Thrillseekers feat.

The post-modern feeling for language is similar: words may be written, but can't mean. The result in Ashbery's case is some interesting exercises du style.

The monastery was founded in the 12th or 13th century, its heyday being from the 16th to the 18th century when, thanks to its prolific scriptoria, it was the dominant literary centre of Ottoman-ruled northern Bulgaria. In its present form, the monastery includes a large mid-19th-century church and two chapels. ==History== The Etropole Monastery is located from the eponymous town, which lies to the north-east of the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The closest inhabited place is the village of Ribaritsa, which is west of the monastery. The monastery lies among maple woodlands at the foot of the Balkan Mountains. The monastery was founded during the Second Bulgarian Empire, either in the 12th or 13th century. According to a stone inscription reportedly placed into the foundations of the church, the exact year of its foundation is 1158, during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria. The medieval part of the monastery's history is documented in its commemoration codex (pomenik), which also includes lists of medieval Bulgarian and Serbian monarchs. The Etropole Monastery reached its apogee between the 16th and 18th centuries, when it emerged as the most important literary and cultural centre of the northern Bulgarian lands under Ottoman rule, with its own scriptoria and a calligraphic school with a characteristic style. Under abbots Anthony, Zachary and Raphael, who were in charge of the monastery from the 1620s to the 1640s, the Etropole Literary School was a major centre of production for chiefly religious manuscripts. Its influence spread throughout the Balkans to other schools of the time. Particularly active scribes of this period were the priest Valcho, hieromonk Daniel, John the Grammarian and Basil of Sofia. Thanks to the successful literary efforts of its community, the monastery was able to sustain itself through the sale of manuscripts,Nikolova-Houston, p. 83 in addition to donations from wealthy locals. 76 works of the Etropole Literary School are housed by the National Library of Bulgaria and the Museum of Church History. In the late 19th century, during the last decades of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, the time of Bulgaria's struggle for independence, the monastery provided shelter to national hero Vasil Levski and other anti- Ottoman revolutionaries.–ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, \\"–ï–¢–†–û–ü–û–õ–°–ö–ò –ú–ê–ù–ê–°–¢–ò–† , \\"–í–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∏—Ç–µ—Ü\\" [ETROPOLE MONASTERY, \\"Varovitets\\"]\\" Levski even had a hiding place specially built for himself at the monastery. At present the monastery is inhabited by a small number of nuns. ==Architecture and culture== The monastery's present main church (katholikon) is a large cruciform three-naved church that features five hexagon-shaped turret domes. The church was constructed in 1858 or 1859, though its exterior decoration was not finished until 1860 and its current set of interior frescoes were only painted from 1896 to 1907. The main material in the church's construction, limestone, may be the origin of the monastery's alternative name, Varovitets (from Bulgarian –≤–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∏—Ç varovit, \\"limy\\"). The church was designed by the architect Ivan Boyanov (Boyanin) from Bratsigovo and built to replace the old monastery church, which was destroyed because of its deteriorating condition. The same architect also designed a previous incarnation of the Saint Nedelya Church in Sofia. In addition to the main church, the Etropole Monastery also includes two smaller chapels and various residential buildings in the Bulgarian National Revival style, which are situated in a grass-covered yard. The chapels are each dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saints Cosmas and Damian. One of the rooms in the residential quarters functions as a small museum to Vasil Levski, focusing on his time hiding at the monastery. Among the valuable items in possession of the monastery are two 15th-century crosses with rich silver decoration and a gold- plated ossuary. The oldest icon from the Etropole Monastery is a rendition of the Holy Trinity of the Old Testament from 1598 painted by the teacher Nedyalko from Lovech; several 17th- and 18th-century icons previously in use at the monastery are now part of the National Art Gallery's collection. The monastery celebrates its holiday on Pentecost, the feast of the Holy Trinity. In the woods in the vicinity of the monastery are the Varovitets Waterfall, high, and its source, an eponymously named karst spring. ==References== Category:Bulgarian Orthodox monasteries Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:Christian monasteries in Bulgaria Category:Churches completed in 1858 Category:Churches completed in 1859 Category:Buildings and structures in Sofia Province ","title":"Etropole Monastery"},{"id":"35187711","text":"Sherkat-e Margh Tak (, also Romanized as Sherkat-e Margh Ta·∏µ; also known as Sherkat-e Morghak) is a village in Kuhpayeh-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The capital was at Banyuwangi. It had a long history of its own, developing contemporaneously with the largest Hindu kingdom in Java, Majapahit (1293‚Äì1527). At the time of the collapse of Majapahit in the late fifteenth century, Blambangan stood on its own as the one solitary Hindu state left in Java, controlling the larger part of Java‚Äôs Oosthoek. The historical record and the study of Blambangan Kingdom is scarce, which contributed to the obscurity of its history. Contemporary Javanese mostly know the kingdom through its link to the popular epic folklore, the legend of Damarwulan and Menak Jingga. The fictional story which is set in Majapahit period, told that the rebellious King of Blambangan named Menak Jingga, desired the hand of Majapahit Queen Kencanawungu. ==History== Formation and growth During Majapahit period circa 13th century, the eastern realm was regarded as peripheral area of the Javanese kingdom, which centered in Trowulan, Majapahit and surrounding Brantas River basin, whereas eastern salient areas such as Lumajang were regarded as the outlying provinces. The Majapahit kingdom was established in 1293 by Raden Wijaya with the help of cunning and able Arya Wiraraja, the Regent of Madura. As the reward of Wiraraja's support, in 1295, Raden Wijaya agreed to give the eastern salient of Java, which includes Blambangan areas with Lumajang as its capital. The Nagarakretagama, composed in 1365, mentioned that the central part of eastern corner of Java wast visited by King Hayam Wuruk in his royal tour in 1359. The poem contains interesting information about the region. The eastern realm become the vassal or as mancanagara (provinces) of Majapahit. However, it seems that the eastern realm steadily has grown quite independently. The eastern salient become the host of eastern court which rival Majapahit central authority. The rivalry erupted in Paregreg war (1404-1406), which was fought as the contest of succession between Western court led by Wikramawardhana, against Eastern court led by Bhre Wirabhumi. In 1406 the western troops led by Bhre Tumapel, the son of Wikramawardhana, penetrated the eastern palace and defeated Bhre Wirabhumi. After the collapse of Majapahit in the late 15th century, Blambangan stood alone as the sole Javanese Hindu polity in Java. The kingdom subsequently was contested and harassed by successive of expansive Javanese Islamic states to the west, from Demak to Pajang and Mataram. On the eastern side across the strait, the Balinese courts of Gelgel and Mengwi, also has invested its political interest in the region, as the Balinese regarded Blambangan as a buffer state to ward off Islamic expansive influences. In the first decades of the 16th century, Tom√© Pires' informants reported that the \\"heathen\\" Blambangan kingdom was the most powerful Javanese kingdom east of Surabaya. At that time, the port of Panarukan was the commercial as well as the political center of the kingdom. For almost three centuries, Blambangan was situated between two different political factions, the Islamic state of Mataram in the west, and various Hindu realms in Bali (Gelgel, Buleleng, and Mengwi) in the east. Both neighbouring powers simultaneously contested the territory of Blambangan to appease their own political and religious ambitions. Decline The Balinese used Blambangan as a buffer against the Islamic expansion initiated by Muslim Mataram from the west and also found it useful to bolster the economy of Bali which was heavily overshadowed by endemic warfare. In the second half of the 16th century, a few Roman Catholic missionaries from Portuguese colony in Malacca arrived in East Java to try to convert the local people. They visited Panarukan and Blambangan, and reported that the port of Panarukan was contested between the Muslim rulers of Pasuruan alied with Surabaya, against the Hindu King of Blambangan and Panarukan. The Balinese chronicle Babad Gumi, which was first composed around the early 1700s, ascribed the fall of Blambangan around this period on the year 1520 ≈õaka or 1598 AD. This is one of the first dates within the babad that can be positively proved to be correct by comparison with European materials of the same period. When the Dutch visited Bali in February 1597 a large expedition was being collected by the king of Gelgel in Bali in order to help the lord of Blambangan from Pasuruan attack. The expedition must have been a failure, as another Dutch report from early 1601 mentioned that the Pasuruan army had taken Blambangan some years ago and exterminated the royal family therein. Other accounts asserted that the conquest of Blambangan by the forces of Sultan Agung of Mataram took place in 1639, which also the end of Panarukan's independence. With the loss of its important port, Panarukan, the center of Blambangan kingdom was receded to inland south to present day Blambangan area, with its port in Banyuwangi. In 1665, Tawang Alun II Danureja, the 8th king of Blambangan, opened the forest of Sudiamara and establishes a new capital in Macan Putih, Kabat subdistrict located about 10 kilometres from Banyuwangi. Of the nine rulers who once ruled Blambangan, Tawang Alun II (1665-1691) is considered as one of the greatest kings of Blambangan. During his reign, Blambangan territory reached Jember, Lumajang, Situbondo and Bali. Blambangan society at that time lived peacefully and prosperous, after all time engaged in various warfare against the expansionist neighboring kingdoms to the west and east. The VOC archive mentioned the spectacular ngaben (cremation) ceremony of Tawang Alun II, that among his 400 wives, 271 of them performed suttee (self immolation). In 1697, the Balinese Kingdom of Buleleng, sent its expedition to Blambangan, which established Balinese influence in the region. In the early 18th century, the Dutch and British contested each other‚Äôs political and economic power in the region. Internal disputes about the succession at the court of Blambangan impaired the kingdom, making it vulnerable to foreign intervention. ==See also== *Monarchs of Java *Majapahit Empire *Osing People ==ReferencesFurther reading== # Category:Historical Hindu empires Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia Category:Former countries in Indonesian history Category:History of East Java ","title":"Blambangan Kingdom"},{"id":"35187958","text":"Mazraeh Jazmeh (, also Romanized as Mazra‚Äòeh Jazmeh) is a village in Kuhpayeh-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It had an estimated magnitude of as high as 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum estimated intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a local tsunami in the Bay of Bengal and caused at least 200 deaths. The earthquake was associated with major areas of both uplift and subsidence. It is also associated with a change in course of the Brahmaputra River to from east of Dhaka (Old Brahmaputra River) to to the west via the Jamuna River. ==Tectonic setting== The eastern part of Bangladesh and the southwestern part of Burma lie along the highly oblique convergent boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The degree to which this deformation is partitioned into zones of thrust tectonics (accommodating that part of the motion perpendicular to the boundary) and strike-slip tectonics (accommodating the northward movement of the Indian Plate) varies along the boundary. A pure strike-slip boundary that strike parallel to the plate vector runs along the Western Burma Scarp, that is replaced to the north by the Indo-Burmese Wedge fold and thrust belt, at the western edge of the boundary zone, and a series of major dextral (right lateral) strike-slip faults, particularly the Kabaw Fault and Sagaing Fault further to the east. The presence of active subduction along the eastern margin of the Bay of Bengal is disputed. ==Earthquake== The earthquake lasted for about four minutes at Chittagong. The epicentre is not well-constrained and likely locations have varied from near Chittagong to along the Arakan coast. The extent of the rupture is uncertain but may have been as much as 700 km along the plate interface. This is based both on the extent of uplift, which was recorded along the coast of Burma from Foul Island to Ramree Island, and the area of subsidence around Chittagong, further north. The 700 km extent combined with an estimated displacement of ten metres gives a maximum estimated magnitude of 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale. Other workers have pointed out that neither the subsidence, which could be due to lateral spreading, nor the uplift, which is not unequivocally linked to the 1762 earthquake, necessarily provide a reasonable estimate for the size of this event and prefer to regard this as a magnitude 7‚Äì8 earthquake. Studies of uplifted marine terraces along the Burmese coast have found evidence for three uplifts, the most recent of which is interpreted to be from the 1762 earthquake. The Saint Martin's Island has been uplifted by 2- 2.5 m during that earthquake. A repeat period of about 500 ‚Äì 700 years has been suggested for earthquakes similar to that in 1762. ==Tsunami== A tsunami was reported along the northeastern coast of the Bay of Bengal and at Dhaka and Kolkata. This is regarded as a local tsunami, as no effects were recorded on the western side of the bay. ==Damage== In Chittagong it was reported that no buildings or walls built of brick had escaped either destruction or serious damage. The East India Company's factory inside the fort was so badly damaged that it could no longer be safely used. An area of about permanently subsided beneath the sea along the coast near Chittagong. At Bar Chara, just north of Cox's Bazar, the land sank and 200 people were killed. Chittagong was said to have \\"suffered severely\\" with soil liquefaction effects such as sand volcanoes and ground fissures. ==See also== * List of historical earthquakes ==References== Category:Earthquakes in Bangladesh Category:Earthquakes in Myanmar Category:1762 earthquakes Category:1762 tsunamis Category:1762 in Asia Category:18th century in Burma ","title":"1762 Arakan earthquake"},{"id":"35187977","text":"Tazehabad (, also Romanized as TƒÅzehƒÅbƒÅd; also known as SeyyedƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Kuhpayeh-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

He was drafted by the Brandon Wheat Kings in the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft, and played with them his entire major junior hockey career. Pulock was selected by the New York Islanders in the first round (15th overall) of the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. The following season, Pulock was named to the 2014 WHL First All-Star Team. On September 28, 2013, Pulock was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Islanders. Pulock played three seasons with the Islanders American Hockey League affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers before earning playing time in the NHL. While playing with the Sound Tigers he was named to the All-Rookie Team and named an AHL All-Star for two consecutive AHL seasons. Pulock earned his first NHL call-up of the 2015‚Äì16 season after Calvin de Haan was placed on injured reserve. He made his NHL debut on February 28, 2016, against the Edmonton Oilers. He recorded his first career NHL goal on March 17, in a 4‚Äì2 loss to the Nashville Predators.. Pulock also scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal, a power play goal in Game 3 against the Florida Panthers, in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs. Pulock began the 2016‚Äì17 season with the Islanders but sustained an injury at the beginning of the season, and spent the rest of the year in the AHL. The following season fared better for Pulock, who made the team out of training camp and played the entire season in the NHL. He re-signed with the Islanders on July 17, 2018. During the 2018 offseason, Pulock volunteered as a guest instructor at Micheal Ferland's Hockey School in Brandon, Manitoba, alongside Brigette Lacquette, Harley Garrioch, Jens Meilleur, Zach Whitecloud, Tyler Plante, Shaq Merasty, Josh Elmes, and Joel Edmundson. ==Personal life== Pulock grew up in Grandview, Manitoba with his brothers Brock, Derrick, and parents Dave and Tannis.

They remain important cultural symbols of Egypt. The flag of Egyptian nationalist revolutionaries during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. It displays both the Islamic Crescent representing Muslim Egyptians and the Christian cross representing Christian Egyptians. Egyptian nationalism is the nationalism of Egyptians and Egyptian culture. Egyptian nationalism has typically been a civic nationalism that has emphasized the unity of Egyptians regardless of ethnicity or religion. Egyptian nationalism first manifested itself in Pharaonism beginning in the 19th century that identified Egypt as being a unique and independent political unit in the world since the era of the Pharaohs in ancient Egypt. ==History== Late 19th century Both the Arabic language spoken in modern Egypt and the ancient Egyptian language are Afroasiatic languages.David P. Silverman. Ancient Egypt. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 1997. p. 234. The rule of Muhammad Ali of Egypt led Egypt into an advanced level of socioeconomic development in comparison with Egypt's neighbours, which along with the discoveries of relics of ancient Egyptian civilization, helped to foster Egyptian identity and Egyptian nationalism. The Urabi movement in the 1870s and 1880s was the first major Egyptian nationalist movement that demanded an end to the alleged despotism of the Muhammad Ali family and demanded curbing the growth of European influence in Egypt, it campaigned under the nationalist slogan of \\"Egypt for Egyptians\\". One of the key figures in opposing British rule was the Egyptian Jewish journalist Yaqub Sanu whose cartoons from 1870s onward satirizing first the Khedive, Ismail the Magnificent, and then Egypt's British rulers as bumbling buffoons were very popular in the 19th century. Sanu was the first to write in Egyptian Arabic, which was intended to appeal to a mass audience, and his cartoons could be easily understood by even the illiterate. Sanu had established the newspaper Abu-Naddara Zarqa, which was the first newspaper to use Egyptian Arabic on 21 March 1877. One of his cartoons mocked Ismail the Magnificent for his fiscal extravagance which caused Egypt's bankruptcy in 1876, leading Ismail, who did not appreciate the cartoon, to order his arrest. Sanu fled to Paris, and continued to publish Abu-Naddara Zarqa there, with its issues being smuggled into Egypt until his death in 1912. Opposed to the British occupation of his homeland, Sanu from 1882 drew cartoons which depicted the British as \\"red locusts\\" devouring all of Egypt's wealth, leaving nothing behind for the Egyptians. Though banned in Egypt, Abu-Naddara Zarqa was a very popular underground newspaper with Sanu's cartoons being especially popular. Other cartoons drawn by Saunu with captions in Arabic and French depicted La Vieux Albion (England) as a hideous hag together with her even more repulsive son John Bull, who was always shown as an ignorant, uncouth and drunken bully pushing around ordinary Egyptians. Sanu's Egyptian nationalism was based on loyalty to Egypt as a state and geographic entity as he presented Egypt as a tolerant place where Muslims, Christians and Jews were all united by a common love of al-watan (\\"the homeland\\"). Against the claim made by British officials like Lord Cromer who claimed the British occupation of Egypt was necessary to protect Egypt's Jewish and Christian minorities from the Muslim majority, Sanu wrote that as an Egyptian Jew he did not feel threatened by the Muslim majority, saying in a speech in Paris \\"The Quran is not a book of fanaticism, superstition or barbarity.\\" 20th century After the British occupation of Egypt in 1882, Egyptian nationalism became focused upon ending British colonial rule. They had support from Liberals and Socialists in Britain. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt was a leading critic of British imperialism in Africa, as expressed in three widely circulated books: The Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt... (1907), Gordon at Khartoum (1911), and My Diaries: Being a Personal Narrative of Events, 1888-1914 (2 vols. 1919-20). Historian Robert O. Collins says: :The most vigorous English advocate of Egyptian nationalism, Blunt was both arrogant and irascible, his works scathing, discursive, and at times utterly ridiculous. Immature and unfair, both he and his writings must be used with caution, but even the dullest of men will come away stimulated if not aroused and with fresh insights to challenge the sometimes smug attitudes of British officials in Whitehall and Cairo. Of course, to them Blunt was anathema if not disloyal and Edward Malet, the British Consul-General at Cairo from 1879 to 1883, replied to Blunt's charges in his posthumously published Egypt, 1879-1883 (London, 1909).Robert O. Collins, \\"Egypt and the Sudan\\" in Robin W. Winks, ed., The Historiography of the British Empire-Commonwealth: Trends, Interpretations and Resources (Duke U.P. 1966) p 282. The Malet book is online Mustafa Kamil Pasha, a leading Egyptian nationalist of the early 20th century, was greatly influenced by the example of Meiji Japan as an 'Eastern' state that had successfully modernized for Egypt and from the time of the Russian-Japanese war consistently urged in his writings that Egypt emulate Japan. Kamil was also a Francophile like most educated Egyptians of his generation, and the French republican values of libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√© influenced his understanding of what it meant to be Egyptian as Kamil defined Egyptianess in terms of loyalty to Egypt. Kamil together with other Egyptian nationalists helped to redefine loyalty to al-watan (\\"the homeland\\") in terms stressing the importance of education, nizam (order), and love of al-watan, implicitly criticizing the state created by Mohammad Ali the Great, which was run on very militarist lines. After the Entene Cordial of 1904 ended hopes of French support for Egyptian independence, a disillusioned Kamil looked east towards Japan as a model, defining Egypt as an \\"Eastern\\" country occupied and exploited by \\"Western\\" Great Britain, and suggested in terms that anticipated later Third World nationalism that Egyptians had more in common with people from other places occupied by the Western nations such as India (modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and the Netherlands East Indies (modern Indonesia) than they did with the nations of Europe. Egyptian nationalism reached its peak in popularity in 1919 when revolution against British rule took place in response to wartime deprivations imposed by the British upon Egypt during World War I. Three years of protest and political turmoil followed until Britain unilaterally declared the independence of Egypt in 1922 that was a monarchy, though Britain reserved several areas for British supervision. During the period of the Kingdom of Egypt, Egyptian nationalists remained determined to terminate the remaining British presence in Egypt. One of the more celebrated cases of Egyptian nationalism occurred in December 1922 when the Egyptian government laid claim to the treasures found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun, which had been discovered by a British archaeologist Howard Carter in November 1922, arguing that they belonged to Egypt and Carter could not take them to Britain as he planned. The dispute finally led to the Egyptians posting an armed guard outside of Tutankhaum's tomb to prevent Carter from entering it. In February 1924, the Egyptian government seized control of the tomb and with it all of the artifacts found there, saying that they belonged to Egypt. On 6 March 1924, the Prime Minister Saad Zaghloul formally opened to Tutakhuam's tomb to the Egyptian public in an elaborate ceremony held at night with the sky lit up by floodlights, which reportedly attracted the largest crowd seen in Luxor. The reopening turned into an anti- British demonstration when the British High Commissioner, Field Marshal Allenby, arrived when the crowd demanding immediate British withdrawal from Egypt. The dispute over who owned King Tutankhamun's treasures took place against the backdrop of a movement in the Egyptian intelligentsia known as Pharaonism which extolled ancient Egypt as a national symbol and portrayed Egypt as a Mediterranean nation with links to Europe instead of a Near Eastern nation. Though Arab nationalism rose as a political force in the 1930s, there remained a strong regional attachment to Egypt by those who advocated cooperation with other Arab or Muslim neighbours. Traditionally, the term \\"Arab\\" had a derogatory meaning in Egypt despite the fact that 90% of Egyptians speak Arabic as their first language, as Egyptians tended to view people from other Arab countries as backward, ignorant and crude. Egyptian nationalists in the early 20th century were usually opposed to the idea of Egypt becoming part of a pan-Arab state. Saad Zaghloul, the founder of the Wafd Party, was hostile towards pan-Arabism, saying: \\"If you add one zero to another, and then to another, what sum will you get?\\" Pan-Arab nationalists, who in the early 20th century tended to be Christians from the Levant, usually excluded Egypt from their planned nation under the grounds that: \\"Egyptians do not belong to the Arab race\\". The nationalistic and fascistic Young Egypt Society in the 1930s led by Ahmed Hussein advocated British withdrawal from Egypt and the Sudan, and promised to unite the Arab world under the leadership of Egypt, through the Young Egypt Society made it clear in the proposed empire, it was Egypt that would dominate. At the same time, \\"Pharaohism\\" was condemned by Hassan al-Banna, the founder and Supreme Guide of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, as glorying a period of jahiliyyah (\\"barbarous ignorance\\"), which is the Islamic term for the pre-Islamic past. In a 1937 article, Banna dismissed \\"Pharaohism\\" for glorying the \\"pagan reactionary Pharaohs\\" like Akhenaton, Ramses the Great and Tutakhuam instead of the Prophet Mohammad and his companions and for seeking to \\"annihilate\\" Egypt's Muslim identity. In January 1952, British forces attacked a police station leaving around 50 people dead. The capital of Egypt, Cairo, overflowed with British anti-violence in a riot on 26 January 1952 known as the \\"Black Saturday\\" riot. The Black Saturday riots led to the development of the Free Officer movement, consisting of a thousand ‚Äúmiddle-level‚Äù officers, overthrowing King Farouk. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 that overthrew the monarchy and established a republic, Gamal Abdel Nasser rose to power on themes that mixed Arab and Egyptian nationalism. Nasser saw Egypt as the leader of the Arab states and saw Egypt's role as promoting Arab solidarity against both the West and Israel. Nasser's first priority was end subordination to Britain which meant most urgently the removal of British bases privileges and acquire greater control over the Suez Canal. In 1952 Nasser produced a work that was half autobiographical and half programmatic entitled The Philosophy of the Revolution. It offers and account to how he and other officers who overthrew the monarchy on July 23 of that year came to a decision to seize power and how they planned to use their newly won power. Under Nasser, Egypt's Arab identity was greatly played up, and Nasser promoted a policy of pan-Arabism, arguing that all of the Arab peoples should be united together in a single state under his leadership. Egypt was briefly united with Syria under the name the United Arab Republic from 1958 until 1961 when Syria abandoned the union. Nasser saw himself as the successor of Mohammad Ali the Great, the illiterate Albanian tobacco merchant turned Ottoman vali (governor) of Egypt, who had sought to found a new dynasty to rule the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Nasser came to embrace pan-Arabism as the best way of justifying a greater Egypt that would stretch from the Atlantic to Indian oceans. After the Six Day War of 1967, Nasser started to downplay pan-Arab nationalism, and instead promoted an \\"Egypt first\\" policy, a policy that was continued by his successor Sadat who took the \\"Egypt first\\" policy far further than Nasser had been prepared to go. In March 1969, Nasser began the War of Attrition with Israel, a policy of launching air raids, artillery bombardments and commando raids intended to make the Sini too costly for Israel to hold, and which led Israel to retaliate likewise with its own air raids, artillery bombardments and commando raids into Egypt. The War of Attrition turned the cities of the Suez Canal into ghost towns, Egyptian military expenditure consumed a quarter of the national income while Egypt was deprived of the revenue from the Suez Canal tolls. After the Israeli Air Force began bombing the cities in the Nile river valley in late 1969, Nasser forced the Soviet Union to deploy its air defense units to Egypt in January 1970 by threatening to resign in favor of a pro-American politician. Through the Soviet forces had arrived in Egypt to assist with the War of Attrition, for many ordinary Egyptians it was a humiliating reminder of their inability to counter the Israeli Air Force. The War of Attrition period of 1969-70 was a period of rapidly falling living standards in Egypt and led many ordinary Egyptians to complain that Egypt's role as the champion of Arab nationalism led to a seemingly endless confrontation with Israel whose costs were too high. In August 1970, Nasser ended the War of Attrition by signing a ceasefire with Israel, and in September 1970 hosted a pan-Arab summit to end the Black September war in Jordan. When Nasser was criticized for signing a ceasefire with Israel by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, he exploded in rage: \\"You issue statements, but we have to fight. If you want to liberate, then get in line in front of us...but we have learnt caution after 1967 and after the Yemenis dragged us into their affairs in 1967 and the Syrians into war in 1967\\". Nasser's successors, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak de-emphasized Arab nationalism and re-emphasized Egyptian nationalism based on Egypt's distinctiveness within the Arab world. Sadat upon taking office in 1970 announced that his first policy would be \\"Egypt first\\", saying quite openly that Egyptian national interests would take precedence over pan-Arab goals. In December 1970, Sadat announced in a speech that Egypt would be willing to make peace with Israel provided the latter returned the Sinai peninsula, making no mention of the West Bank, Gaza Strip or the Golan Heights. In June 1972, Sadat expelled all of the Soviet forces in Egypt, a move which was very popular with the Egyptian people as he announced that Egypt could now defend its air space on its own. After the 1973 October War had boosted his image, Sadat began a wholesale attack on Nasser's legacy, including his Pan-Arabist policies, which were portrayed as having dragged Egypt into poverty, a long grinding war in Yemen, and subservience to the Soviet Union. In contrast to the secularist Nasser, Sadat began a policy of playing up Egypt's Muslim identity, having the constitution amended in 1971 to say that Sharia law was \\"a main source of all state legislation\\" and in 1980 to say that Sharia law was the main source of all legislation. Through Sadat was not an Islamic fundamentalist, under his rule Islam started to be portrayed as the cornerstone of Egyptian national identity. Sadat had chosen to launch what Egyptians call the Ramadan War in 1973 during the holy month of Ramadan and the code-name for the initial assault on the Israeli Bar Lev Line on the Suez Canal was Operation Badr, after the Prophet Mohammad's first victory, both gestures that would have been unthinkable under Nasser as Sadat chose to appeal to Islamic feelings. Sadat and Mubarak also abandoned Nasser's Arab nationalist conflict with Israel and the West. At times, Sadat chose to engage in \\"Pharaohism\\" as when he arranged for the mummy of Ramses the Great to be flown to Paris for restoration work in 1974, he insisted that the coffin carrying his corpse be greeted at Charles de Gaulle airport with a 21-gun salute as befitting a head of state. However, Sadat's \\"Pharaonism\\" was mostly limited to the international stage, and rarely occurred domestically, as he closed the mummy room at the Egyptian Museum for supposedly Islamic sensibilities, though he reportedly remarked in private that \\"Egyptian kings are not be made a spectacle of\\". ==Recent years== The Arab Spring in Egypt in 2011 that forced the resignation of Mubaruk from power and resulted in dualparty elections, has raised questions over the future of Egyptian nationalism.Lin Noueihed, Alex Warren. The Quest for the Arab Spring: Revolution, Counter-Revolution and the Making of a New Era. Yale University Press, 2012. pp. 125‚Äì128. In particular the previous secular regimes of Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak avoided direct religious conflicts between the majority Muslims and the minority Coptic Christians through their emphasis on secular Egyptian nationalist culture, while concerns have been raised on whether this Egyptian nationalist culture will remain with the political changes caused by the Arab Spring.Lin Noueihed, Alex Warren. The Battle for the Arab Spring: Revolution, Counter-Revolution and the Making of a New Era. Yale University Press, 2012. pp. 125‚Äì128. This has especially become an issue after a series of episodes of Muslim-Christian violence erupted in Egypt in 2011. In 2015, a surprise hit on Egyptian television was Harat al-Yehud, which was set in Cairo's Jewish quarter in 1948, and was noted as being the first time that Egyptian Jews were portrayed in a favorable light, instead of the villains that have normally portrayed as since the 1950s. ==See also== *Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed *Arab nationalism *Egyptian Revolution of 1919 *Egyptian Revolution of 1952 *Gamal Abdel Nasser *Saad Zaghloul *Taha Hussein *Pharaonism *Union of State Supporters ==ReferencesBibliography== *Fahamy, Ziad \\"Francophone Egyptian Nationalists, Anti-British Discourse, and European Public Opinion, 1885-1910: The Case of Mustafa Kamil and Ya'qub Sannu'\\" from Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Volume 28, Number 1, 2008 p. 170-183 * *Laffan, Michael \\"Mustafa and the Mikado: A Francophile Egyptian's turn to Meiji Japan\\" p. 269-286 from Japanese Studies, Vol 19, # 3, 1999 p. 269-270 * *Lin Noueihed, Alex Warren.

The Khamnigan people, called the Horse Tungus or Steppe Tungus, are natively bilingual, speaking both a Mongolic and a Tungusic language, which are inherited from their mixed ancestry. This bilingualism appears to be several centuries old. Their Tungusic language is Evenki (Khamnigan is the Mongol name for the Evenki), while Khamnigan Mongol is a distinct Mongolic language, not a dialect of Mongol or Buryat as traditionally classified in Mongolia or Russia. Mongol is the dominant language; the two dialects of Evenki are only used by part of the population, and then at home. The language has declined in Russia, with few speakers left, but both Khamnigan Mongol and Evenki bilingualism remain vigorous in China. Khamnigan Evenki, though not a distinct language from other Evenki, is heavily influenced by Mongol, especially in vocabulary. Khamnigan Mongol, on the other hand, is the most conservative Mongolic language, little different from Middle Mongolian, though the system of vowel harmony has been disrupted.

Irwin Goldenberg was the congregation‚Äôs first religious leader. The congregation established a religious school, with 23 students attending the first class which was held on February 18, 1966 at the two Manalapan homes. The U.S. Route 9 corridor in Manalapan was expanding quickly, and many Jewish families from New York City were relocating to the area. By 1967, the members of Temple Shaari Emeth needed more space for the growing congregation. In 1968, Kevork Hovnanian donated 3.5 acres of land on Craig Road in Manalapan. Construction of the new synagogue began in May 1969 and was completed in April 1970. The synagogue underwent a major renovation in 1990. ==Religious school== The religious school has 527 students in grades K-10, with another 16 students enrolled in the school's post-confirmation program (grades 11-12). ==Clergy and staff== Rabbi Peter Kasdan of Marlboro served as the temple's religious leader from 1969 to 1971. He was succeeded by Rabbi Phillip Schechter of Freehold, who occupied the position for the next 29 years. In 2003, Rabbi Melinda Panken of New York City became Temple Shaari Emeth's religious leader.

He is married to Edit Varga. ==Education== He graduated from Temesv√°ri Pelb√°rt Franciscan Grammar School in Esztergom. He continued his studies at Semmelweis University of Medicine, where he received his degree in 1996. ==Business career== K√≥ka got involved in the emerging Hungarian IT industry while still at university, working as Project Manager and later Sales Director at one of Hungary's first ISPs, Elender LLC from 1994 and 1996. From 1996 he served as Managing Director of Elender Computer LLC, then from 1998, following the company's transformation into a private limited company, as CEO of Elender IT, Inc. In 1999 Elender was acquired by PSINet, Inc. and K√≥ka became Country Manager, then from 2000 European Vice President of Business Development. He also became Chairman of the Board of Webigen Inc. in July 2000. He returned to his former company in October 2002, serving as CEO of Elender Business Communications. In 2004 he was appointed President of Euroweb Internet Service Provider Inc. He was a board member of the ICT Association of Hungary (IVSZ) from 2000, and President from March 2003 until October 2004.

In 2000 he received the ‚ÄôIT Manager of the Year‚Äô award founded by the ICT Association of Hungary. ==Political career== In October 2004, K√≥ka was appointed Minister of Economy and Transport, supported by SZDSZ, which he later became a member of in 2006. During this period his main tasks included the development of a business-friendly environment, stimulating the growth of the corporate sector, promoting a knowledge-based economy and increasing the international presence of domestic businesses. In June 2006 he was reappointed Minister of Economy and Transport. Between 2007-2008 he served as President of the Liberal Party, and until 2010 as parliamentary group leader, member of the Budget Committee, and Chairman of the Nabucco Committee aiming to reduce the country's reliance on Russian gas.

On March 31, 2008, various reform-related disagreements between the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and SZDSZ led SZDSZ leader K√≥ka to announce that his party would quit the coalition by May 1, 2008. This also meant that MSZP would have to form the first minority government in Hungary since the political transition in 1990. However, the legitimacy of K√≥ka's position as party president became questioned when it was discovered that some signatures of the delegates to the assembly electing him had been forged. Since he had won his position by a very small margin over G√°bor Fodor, these votes might have changed the outcome.

He is the founder and owner of Austrian magazine publishing house Ahead Media. ==Early years== Alexander Geringer was born and raised in the Ottakring district of Vienna, Austria. As a high school student at the municipal science-oriented upper school Bundesrealgymnasium Schuhmeierplatz (BRG XVI), he led his school‚Äôs team to victory at the Vienna High School Chess Tournament in 1979. He was also active in school politics and in 1983 as school spokesman joined the Vienna municipal school advisory council. In 1982, Geringer co-organized with two other schools the first-ever music festival that was held on Vienna‚Äôs Danube Island. Held on June 19, 1982, some 3000 guests experienced the performances of local cult bands such as Chuzpe, Minisex, Rosachrom and Tom Pettings Herzattacken. The event set a precedent: a year later, the Austrian Social Democratic Party (SP√ñ) hosted the first Danube Island festival (Donauinselfest), which now attracts millions. == Early career == Geringer began his journalistic career in 1982 while still in high school at the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) as a designer and radio moderator for programs such as ZickZack, Music Box and Radiothek. During this time, ZickZack was awarded the ‚ÄúGolden Microphone‚Äù issued by H√∂rzu magazine. == Investigative Journalism == In 1984, he began studies in business administration at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, yet soon abandoned this to work as a freelance journalist for ORF as well as for various magazines. In 1985 he uncovered a scandal involving the illegal sale of aborted fetuses and brain tissue by the pathology departments of several Vienna hospitals. For years, the German pharmaceutical company B. Braun Melsungen had been purchasing brain tissue derived from corpses directly from department assistants. Working undercover, Geringer also succeeded in purchased brain tissue and aborted embryos. The breaking story was first published in the Austrian news magazine Ikarus,Ikarus, Nr. 02, February 1985 and a year later made the cover of the legendary German magazine Konkret. The scandal gained the attention of numerous European television stations and newspapers such as El Pais, Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine, Der Spiegel. (The company was later involved in an even further-reaching scandal involving contaminated brain tissue used in one of its products, Lyodura.) As an investigative journalist Geringer also reported on the Austrian company Intertrading and its links to international oil & arms trading in conjunction with the million-dollar financial and political scandal in which it was entangled. He also wrote investigative articles for the magazine Wiener, where he served as editor from 1986 to 1988. == Magazine Publishing and Ahead Media == Geringer also made a name for himself as publishing manager and communications advisor for corporate customer magazines. In 1989 he co-founded the R&D; publishing group together with Chris Radda and Andreas Dressler, and as associate member held a 20% share in the company. Here, he created and served as editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine DIVA and the men‚Äôs lifestyle magazine Ego. In 1995 Geringer sold his stakes in the company and started his own boutique publishing house, Ahead Media. From his headquarters in Vienna, Geringer soon opened Ahead Media editorial offices in Berlin and satellite offices in London and New York. It was during this time that Geringer collaborated with Tyler Br√ªl√© to create Wallpaper* magazine in 1996. Geringer served as its first publisher with Ahead Media as co-publisher. The first Wallpaper* issue was produced in Vienna at the Ahead Media offices and created by Ahead Media art director Herbert Winkler.Wallpaper*, Launch Issue, September/October 1996 In the mid-2000s, Geringer opened further editorial offices in Budapest and Prague, and established Ahead Media as a one-stop-shop active in the creation of multilingual consumer magazines, contract publishing, creative services and image consulting.http://aheadmedia.com/ As CEO of Ahead Media, Geringer realized a number of lifestyle design and fashion magazines including Ahead (lifestyle), IQstyle (youth), anyway (travel), and H.O.M.E. (design), which is now published not only in Germany and Austria but also in Central Eastern Europe in Czech, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia and Croatia. In 2014, H.O.M.E. launched a Russian language version for Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, in cooperation with BurdaInternational / Hubert Burda Media. Together with his team, including Desir√©e Treichl-St√ºrgkh, Thomas Machh√∂rndl and Gerhard Amann, Geringer also launched the design fair H.O.M.E.D.E.P.O.T, held annually in Vienna since 2000 and run by Thomas Machh√∂rndl;. In 2008 Geringer licensed the rights from Italian publisher Mondadori to produce the women‚Äôs fashion magazine flair in Austria as well as in CEE. Geringer later acquired the rights to publish flair in Germany, which had previously been with Klambt Media Group, and re-launched flair Germany in Fall 2013. Also in 2013, with an independent license for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Geringer launched the German-language edition of the Italian architecture magazine domus. In the role of creative director, Geringer also conceived several brand magazines for companies such as Silhouette, New Yorker, Stilwerk, Nespresso and Chopard. == References  External links == * Ahead Media website Category:1966 births Category:Austrian journalists Category:Austrian publishers (people) Category:People from Ottakring Category:Living people ","title":"Alexander Geringer"},{"id":"35188662","text":"Sloane Citron (born 1956) is an American publisher based in Menlo Park, California. ==Beginnings== Citron has loved magazines and magazine publishing since he was a youth.

Inman is best known for her 1940 book, In Woman's Defense, which was a pioneering effort to legitimize the domestic labor associated with homemaking as worthy and respectable field of human endeavor. ==Biography== Early years Ida Mary Inman, known to her friends as \\"Mary,\\" was born June 11, 1894 in the state of Kentucky. She was the youngest of nine children. In 1900 the family moved to the Indian Territory, part of today's Oklahoma, and Mary Inman remained there for the next 17 years. Inman's mother died in 1905 and her older sister followed two years later, forcing Mary to begin assuming primary homemaking tasks for the large family at an early age. During the first decade of the 20th century, Oklahoma was a hotbed of activity for the Socialist Party of America and in 1910, when she was just 16, Inman joined that organization. She met her future husband, J. Frank Ryan, an organizer for the Oil Workers' Union of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) not long after. A long courtship ensued before the pair were finally married in July 1917. The honeymoon proved short-lived, however, as anti- Wobbly sentiment grew more bitter and violent during the wartime years, exploding after the suppression of the August 1917 Green Corn Rebellion, which was blamed on the IWW in the press.Nigel Anthony Sellars, Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies: The Industrial Workers of the World in Oklahoma, 1905-1930. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1998; p. 101. In November 1917 the couple found themselves forced to flee Tulsa to avoid anti-IWW vigilantes. Inman and her husband moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where, in an attempt to keep government agents and anti-IWW vigilantes at bay, they assumed Mary's surname rather than his. This temporary expedient was later formalized by both Mary and Frank with a legal change of name. In Woman's Defense Although there is no exact date or reason for their relocation, at some point Mary and Frank Inman moved to Southern California, where they became active in the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Frank went to work for the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company and Mary rented a small office in Los Angeles, where she set to work writing a book on women's labor, emphasizing women's work in the home as a worthy pursuit. The 600 page manuscript was completed in 1936 but was initially rejected by the CPUSA as unsatisfactory for the party press. Instead, Inman began working with former Wobbly turned Communist Harrison George, then the editor of the party's West Coast newspaper, People's World, based in San Francisco. George began publishing Inman's manuscript in weekly installments in the paper. In 1940 these published articles were collected in hard covers as a book entitled In Woman's Defense. Several printings were needed to satisfy demand for the work. In Woman's Defense drew upon Inman's experience as a young girl keeping house for her father and siblings.Weigand, Red Feminism, p. 32. Inman expanded upon the observation of CPUSA women's leader Margaret Cowl that \\"all women are in an unequal position with men in all countries,\\" making the novel argument that in addition to the exploitation they suffered on the basis of their class position, women as a whole were additionally members of a super-exploited social group based upon their gender.Weigand, Red Feminism, pp. 32-33. While Inman's work was at first warmly received by several top Communist women leaders, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Ella Reeve Bloor, the mood changed in 1941 when the CPUSA leadership began an official attack on Inman's work for purported ideological deviation. A series of articles written against Inman's ideas appeared in the party's literary monthly, The New Masses, and the polemic was extended with the publication of a pamphlet by A. Landy, Marxism and the Woman Question. Despite the hostility on the part of the Communist Party, Inman moved forward with the publication of another book in 1942, Woman Power, a work which incorporated the remainder of her 1936 manuscript. Subsequent political career From 1943 to 1946, Inman published an edited a newspaper called Facts for Women, into which she incorporated much of her journalistic energy.\\"Mary Inman, 1894-1986: Papers, 1940-1983: A Finding Aid,\\" Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. Among Inman's unrealized ideas was a desire to form an organization of housewives called the Union of Labor-Power Production Workers (housewives). Inman's alienation from the Communist Party reached its peak in 1949 when she published a bitter mimeographed polemic against the CPUSA's policy towards women, entitled Thirteen Years of CPUSA Misleadership on the Woman Question. Inman's final book was published in 1964, entitled The Two Forms of Production Under Capitalism. Inman remained dedicated to the so-called \\"Woman Question,\\" engaging CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall with a 66-page letter in 1972 and writing a lengthy article for the party's theoretical magazine, Political Affairs, in 1973. Death and legacy Mary Inman's papers are housed in five archival boxes, one folder, and one folio volume at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Youngs turned to their older brother George, who had produced 1988's Blow Up Your Video as well as the band's early albums with Harry Vanda, and Mike Fraser, who had co-produced 1995's Ballbreaker (with Rick Rubin), to complete Stiff Upper Lip. ==Recording== The album was recorded and mixed at Bryan Adams' Warehouse Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada between September and November 1999 with a total of 18 songs recorded in all. In 2000, bassist Cliff Williams remarked to VH1's Behind the Music: \\"It's a killer album. It was a very easy-to-record album in as much as Malcolm and Angus had everything ready to go, so we basically just had to come along and perform as best we could.\\" According to Arnaud Durieux's memoir AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, Malcolm takes a rare guitar solo on \\"Can't Stand Still\\" while Angus does the backing vocals on \\"Hold Me Back\\". The album delves even deeper into the band's blues roots than its predecessor Ballbreaker and features a remarkably clean sound. In an interview with Alan Di Perna of Guitar World, singer Brian Johnson commented on working with George Young: : In the past he's always worked with Harry [Vanda]. Not detracting from Harry, but it was kinda streamlined this time. You had no one to answer to or discuss things with except Malcolm or Angus. We were working pretty hard this time actually, from about 11 in the morning until one the next morning sometimes. Saturdays as well. It was good, though. George always had a game plan. I hate it when you're hanging around waiting for the next decision. George always had it all worked out. ==Composition== Angus Young explained in interviews that the album title occurred to him when he was stuck in traffic and began ruminating on how vital lips were in rock and roll culture, citing icons Elvis Presley and Mick Jagger, and carried a certain sneering defiance. He noted that he had contributed to this tradition himself: : There was a bit of that and also with us there's always been a bit of humour, too. Even when we started, I used to always say, \\"I've got bigger lips than Jagger and I've got bigger lips than Presley when I stick them out.\\" Actually, if you look on the Highway to Hell album, there's my lip stuck up there like this [curls his lip]. I remember when I was a kid I saw an early black-and-white movie of Brigitte Bardot and she had those pouting lips and you go, \\"Well, yeah! I like what she's serving!\\" The video for the title track ‚Äì directed by Andy Morahan,mvdbase.com ‚Äì AC/DC ‚Äì \\"Stiff upper lip\\" ‚Äì starts with the band driving down the street in a red 1997 Hummer H1 and being caught in a traffic jam. They pull into a back alley, get out, and begin to play the song on the street. The song that the band listens to before the car jam is \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\", released when the late Bon Scott was a member. In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the song \\"Safe in New York City\\" was included in the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum, a list of \\"lyrically questionable\\" songs (six other AC/DC songs made the list: \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,\\" \\"Shot Down in Flames,\\" \\"Shoot to Thrill,\\" \\"Hell's Bells,\\" \\"T.N.T.,\\" and \\"Highway to Hell\\"). In a May 2000 interview with Alan Di Perna for Guitar World ‚Äì just over a year prior to the tragedy ‚Äì Angus Young was asked if he really felt safe in New York City: \\"That song is a little tongue in cheek. Last time I was in New York, that's all people were talking about: how safe it was, how it was gonna be such a great place to live. For me, New York has always been a city of unpredictability. You can never guess what's going to happen next.\\" The album cover features a bronze statue of Angus; mimicked on tour in the form of a prop ‚Äì bearing his demonic likeness ‚Äì that was several storeys high. The three singles from it were the title track \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", \\"Safe in New York City\\", and \\"Satellite Blues\\". These three plus \\"Meltdown\\" were played live on the subsequent world tour. In Australia, New Zealand and Europe, a two-disc tour edition of Stiff Upper Lip was released by Albert Productions in January 2001. This includes Stiff Upper Lip plus a disc comprising: a non-album track (\\"Cyberspace\\"), five tracks from a concert at Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, Madrid, Spain in 1996 (released in full length that same year in VHS format and re-released in DVD in October 2000), as well as three videos (for each of the songs released as singles). Songs reportedly recorded for the album that went unreleased were: \\"Let It Go\\", \\"R.I.P. It Up\\", \\"Whistle Blower\\", \\"Rave On\\" and \\"The Cock Crows\\". ==Reception== Stiff Upper Lip rose to #7 on the U.S. Billboard chart and peaked at #12 in the United Kingdom. It hit #1 in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and Austria. It was better received by critics than Ballbreaker but was considered lacking in new ideas. ==Track listing== Deluxe Edition Disc 2 ==Video== Stiff Upper Lip Live is the name of the live video released in 2001 by AC/DC, recorded on 14 June 2001 at the Olympiastadion in Munich, Germany, on their Stiff Upper Lip Tour.

The book chronicles the life of a 16- to 17-year-old girl, Mclean, and her journey of self-discovery. ==Plot summary== The story begins with the narrator, Mclean Sweet, describing the table of her dad's new restaurant. Mclean lives with her dad, Gus Sweet. Mclean hates the fact that her parents are divorced and that her mom married her dad's favorite basketball team-Defriese University's new coach, Peter Hamilton. Mclean despises her mom for leaving their family. In her backstory, Mclean and her father have moved three times in the last two years because of her dad's new job at EAT, Inc. With each of the moves, Mclean decides to take on different personas. Lakeview is their fourth move. Mclean is quizzed as to which persona she would pick‚Äîwhether it would be \\"the perky rah-rah girl, black-clad drama queen, or student government joiner\\". But as she begins school, she forgets about all those personas and starts to be herself and attracts new friends, plus a new romance. Gus is trying to rebuild a restaurant called the Luna Blu, which is described as a \\"Contemporary Italian and old-fashioned good\\" and in the process he meets Opal. Opal is the type that \\"[takes] each criticism personally\\". She is the manager of Luna Blu and has been there ever since she was a teen. She is very stubborn and likes things done her way. She accidentally accepts the responsibility of making a complex model of the town, which ends up being taken over by Mclean and her friends. Opal and Gus try to rebuild Luna Blu but couldn't, so Gus decided to close it down. After living in Lakeview for a few months, Mclean discovers that her dad got another job offer in Hawaii. While she is trying to cope with the ideas of moving for a fifth time, her friends find out about all the different personas she has taken on by discovering that she has four different Ume pages, each with a different girl that they don't recognize. An Ume page is similar to a Facebook page. Mclean for once is grateful to go to the small beach town of Colby with her mom, which her mom had insisted on doing during Mclean's spring break. She is relieved to get away from all the overwhelming events that has happened back in Lakeview. While she is in Colby, Mclean overhears her mom telling a friend that she thinks that it was mistake inviting Mclean to come to the beach. Since Mclean feels out of place, she decides to leave her mom's house to go to the Poseidon, an old, worn out motel that smells like mildew. Mclean and her mom use to spend many nights in the Poseidon, when they took one of their spontaneous beach trips. Confused and in need of a companion, Mclean calls her \\"two a.m.\\",Dessen, p. 215 the person she knows she can always rely on no matter what, Dave. In the meantime her parents are worried about her. Mclean's mom frantically calls her dad. While Mclean's dad is leaving the house to drive up to Colby to look for Mclean, he sees Dave who tells him where Mclean is. Mclean's parents both go to the Poseidon. There, Mclean tells them about the different personas she has taken on and, for the first time, they realize how hard the divorce is for her. Mclean's parents apologize. Mclean also finds out that she misheard her mom when she was talking to her friend. Her mom was talking about not wanting to host a party at her house this year, like she has done in the past. Following the conversation with her parents, Mclean decides that she will not go to Hawaii with her dad because she does not want to have to start all over again with a new school and new friends so near to the end of her senior year, so her \\"only option\\" is finishing her senior year in Tyler, where her mom lives. When she gets back to Lakeview, after her trip to the beach, she finds out her father's restaurant is officially closing. When Mclean gets home, she hears a woman talking and crying with her dad. She thinks it's Lindsey, who is an annoying councilwoman her dad was briefly dating, but it turns out to be Opal. She finds out that her dad and Opal have been dating. Two weeks later, Mclean and her friends have finished the model, and her dad has officially been assigned to the project in Hawaii. Opal has submitted her resignation, and once the Luna Blu building is put on the market, she plans on buying it to start her own restaurant. Mclean is packing up her belongings because her mom is picking her up and taking her to Tyler that day. As Mclean and her mom are starting to drive away, Mclean's mom stops the car and decides she can't take her daughter away from Lakeview and all of her friends; she can't make Mclean move again. Mclean moves into Opal's spare room and finishes her senior year at Jackson High. == Characters == * Mclean Sweet ‚Äì The protagonist of the story. Mclean's attitude is cautious but very adventurous. She wants to become her own person, not a made-up idea of a character. Mclean is a senior in high school and is still grieving over her parents' horrible divorce. She has moved four times with her dad in the past three years, since her parents' divorce. * Dave Wade ‚Äì Mclean's intelligent neighbor. He is a \\"boy genius who skipped, like, all of junior high and was taking college courses\\". To his parent's dismay, he decided to transfer from an elite private school to a public school because he wanted to have a normal high school experience. Dave owes community service because he was caught underage drinking, so he spends a lot of time working on the model of the town to fill his requirements. Mclean and Dave start falling in love towards the end of the book. * Gus Sweet ‚Äì Mclean's father. He is an attractive man with blue eyes and longish hair, which women are drawn to. He has been divorced for two years. He was a huge fan of Defriese University basketball team, which is an understatement because \\"he lived and breathed DB\\",Dessen, p. 7 until his ex-wife fell in love with the coach. Gus used to own a restaurant in Tyler with his ex-wife, Katherine Hamilton, called Mariposa Grill. He decided to sell it and take a consulting job with EAT INC. His new job takes him all over the country. * Katherine Hamilton ‚Äì Mclean's mom. She came from a very wealthy family that she gave up when she married Gus Sweet. She used to own a restaurant in Tyler with her ex-husband, Mariposa Grill. She left him when she fell in love with the Defriese University basketball coach. She married him and they have twins. She wants to connect with Mclean, but Mclean feels like she ruined their family and doesn't like to talk to her. * Opal ‚Äì The manager of Luna Blu. She has worked there since she was a teenager and doesn't like how much Gus is changing it. She ends up dating Gus towards the end of the book. When Luna Blu closes down, she buys the building and opens her own restaurant there. She lets Mclean move into her spare bedroom, so she can finish up her senior year at Lakeview. * Deb ‚Äì One of Mclean's new friends from school. She has a very peppy attitude and before Mclean came to Lakeview, Deb did not have any friends. She takes control of building the model of the town and later becomes a waitress at Opal's new restaurant. * Peter Hamilton ‚Äì Mclean's stepfather.

For example, in their review of the book, Seventeen Magazine noted that, \\"if you're having any pangs of I-don't-know-who-I-am, Mclean's journey might feel both familiar and inspiring to you\\". Other critics have described the book as \\"A tale of self-identity\\" and as a novel that addresses \\"how important our identities are\\" Another important theme in the novel is family relationships. In one review, Pamela Kramer from the Examiner noted that \\"what the reader learns through Mclean is the importance of family\\". A reviewer from Galley Smith added that the novel has \\"many common themes relating to children of divorce and family dynamics\\". Another important theme in What Happened to Goodbye is friendship. One reviewer stated that \\"working together on an intricate model of the community is a not-so-subtle metaphor for Mclean building an emotional community for herself\\", Dessen emphasizes friendship throughout the novel by \\"having the characters reach out to one another to forge genuine relationships\\". ==Reception== What Happened to Goodbye has mostly received positive reviews. Critics have praised Dessen's way of making her characters realistic. Critic Melissa DeMoux said that each character really \\"resonates with the reader\\". Dessen's books are aimed toward teens because she focuses on the \\"exploration of a teen's life\\". The Horn Book Magazine said that Dessen \\"creates a comfortable space for young adults struggling with identity, relationships, and all that messy family stuff\\". Readers can relate to the characters because they are \\"realistically flawed\\" according to reviewer Galley Smith and LA Times Reviewer Susan Carpenter described Dessen's writing as \\" remain[ing] true to modern adolescence\\" Many reviewers focuses on Dessen's effective character development. The LA Times said that Dessen \\"avoid[s] the usual cliches for such characters,\\" which makes them come to life. Not only can readers relate to the characters, but they can also relate to the situations they are faced with. Seventeen Magazine notes that Dessens \\"ability to write about serious issues in an upbeat manner allows teen to relate to situations they face\\". Critics praise Dessen's ability to create well-developed characters. Publisher Weekly commented that \\"the depth of her well-developed characters grabs readers' attention and leaves them anxious for each new release\\". The supporting characters are as well developed as the main characters. Common Sense commends Dessen for having a \\"strong supporting cast\\". All of the characters have very \\"distinct personalities\\". Even though some critics felt like the characters were well-developed with definitive and unique personalities, critic Joceline Farrah felt like they didn't get a \\"strong sense of personality\\", which made them feel like they didn't get to know the characters. Critics note that Dessen writes in a simple format, but still adds depth and complexity to her novels. Galley Smith commented that \\"What Happened to Goodbye has some simple plot elements yet still manages to be surprisingly complex\\". Publishers Weekly also points out that Dessen does not use \\"complicated dialect\\", which can distract the reader from the main plot. Karen Elliot of Library School Journal also criticized the \\"slight lack of tension... which keeps it from being truly compelling\\". Publisher Weekly commented that it has an \\"emotional punch to a long narrative that doesn't otherwise have much of an arc\\". Common Sense reviewer Darienne Stewart said that the weak conflict causes the story to ramble. Common Sense point out that it is very repetitive because Dessen \\"[draws] unnecessary circles\\" She similarly notes that \\"Dessen often skips backward and forward in the narrative\\", which can be confusing for the reader. == Allusions to other books == *During lunch on Mclean's first day, she mentions that there is a blond girl and a very tall broad shouldered guy, sharing earphones with an iPod.

Classics and The Great Gremlin Adventure was a dark ride located at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia, and Warner Bros. Movie World in Bottrop, Germany (now Movie Park Germany). The ride has been replaced with the Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster and Van Helsing's Factory in the two parks respectively. ==History== On 3 June 1991, Warner Bros. Movie World opened to the public. One of its original attractions was Warner Bros. Classics and The Great Gremlin Adventure. A duplicate of the Australian attraction opened with Warner Bros. Movie World Germany (later renamed Movie Park Germany) on 30 June 1996. It was named Gremlin Invasion. The ride's soft- opening was on 29 June 1996. On 9 September 2001, Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia announced that they would be closing the attraction to make way for a new attraction set to open in 2002. On 17 June 2002, the Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster opened in the location of Warner Bros. Classics & Great Gremlins Adventure. In Germany, Gremlin Invasion remained open until the closure of Warner Bros. Movie World Germany on 31 October 2004. The park reopened on 19 March 2005 as Movie Park Germany, however, the ride remained closed. In mid-2011, the ride was replaced with Van Helsing's Factory, a Gerstlauer Bobsled roller coaster. At Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia, many elements of the ride still exist to this day. The original facade for the attraction exists behind Scooby-Doo Spooky Coasters Spooky Island castle facade. Two of the theatres that were used in the pre-show exist adjacent to the replacement ride's queue. Finally, the unload station still exists (albeit with theming removed) and is used as an evacuation path from the Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster. ==Ride== Riders would queue for the Warner Bros. Classics & Great Gremlins Adventure on the outside of the show building. Groups of riders would be admitted into the building labelled Warner Bros. Studios. Inside guests would be ushered into one of several movie theatres. Here, the riders would watch some outtakes from various Warner Bros. films such as Batman Returns before the screening was interrupted as the Gremlins had taken over. After exiting the theatre up to 20 riders board a single vehicle which navigates its way throughout the film archive in order to escape the Gremlins. They are taken for a slow trip throughout various sets before exiting the building and being unloaded. Riders would exit past two crashed police cars, similar to those used in the Police Academy Stunt Show (with Gizmo inside one of them). There is a slight difference between the two different rides that existed; during the ride at Warner Bros. Movie World, the character Beetlejuice appears periodically during the tour of the film archives and studio, where as in the Movie Park Germany version of the ride the character ALF appears not only on the tour, but on film after the initial clips outtakes, getting harassed by the Gremlins. ==References * The Great Gremlins Adventure at Parkz * Information about the ride at Germany at Gremlins Online Category:Former Warner Bros.

In 1099-OID fraud, the filer of a tax return fills out the form themselves with a false withholding amount and submits it to the IRS in an attempt to reduce tax liability. Promoters of the fraud allege that the withheld amount exists in a secret bank account, a claim that originates from the redemption movement. The IRS initially overlooked the fraud because it lacked time to verify withholding data; however it has since taken notice and responded with both criminal prosecutions and public awareness campaigns. In one egregious case, Ronald L. Brekke of Orange County, California, was convicted on March 17, 2012, in federal court in Seattle, Washington, of conspiracy and wire fraud in which 1,000 people, most of them Canadian, filed fraudulent U.S. tax refund claims with the IRS.

It is part of the larger theory of pseudospectral optimal control, a term coined by Ross. The method is named after Richard E. Bellman. It was introduced by Ross et al.I. M. Ross, Q. Gong and P. Sekhavat, The Bellman pseudospectral method, AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference and Exhibit, Honolulu, Hawaii, AIAA-2008-6448, August 18‚Äì21, 2008. first as a means to solve multiscale optimal control problems, and later expanded to obtain suboptimal solutions for general optimal control problems. ==Theoretical foundations== The multiscale version of the Bellman pseudospectral method is based on the spectral convergence property of the Ross‚ÄìFahroo pseudospectral methods. That is, because the Ross‚ÄìFahroo pseudospectral method converges at an exponentially fast rate, pointwise convergence to a solution is obtained at very low number of nodes even when the solution has high-frequency components. This aliasing phenomenon in optimal control was first discovered by Ross et al. Rather than use signal processing techniques to anti-alias the solution, Ross et al. proposed that Bellman's principle of optimality can be applied to the converged solution to extract information between the nodes. Because the Gauss‚ÄìLobatto nodes cluster at the boundary points, Ross et al. suggested that if the node density around the initial conditions satisfy the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem, then the complete solution can be recovered by solving the optimal control problem in a recursive fashion over piecewise segments known as Bellman segments. In an expanded version of the method, Ross et al., proposed that method could also be used to generate feasible solutions that were not necessarily optimal. In this version, one can apply the Bellman pseudospectral method at even lower number of nodes even under the knowledge that the solution may not have converged to the optimal one. In this situation, one obtains a feasible solution. A remarkable feature of the Bellman pseudospectral method is that it automatically determines several measures of suboptimality based on the original pseudospectral cost and the cost generated by the sum of the Bellman segments. ==Computational efficiency== One of the computational advantages of the Bellman pseudospectral method is that it allows one to escape Gaussian rules in the distribution of node points. That is, in a standard pseudospectral method, the distribution of node points are Gaussian (typically Gauss-Lobatto for finite horizon and Gauss-Radau for infinite horizon). The Gaussian points are sparse in the middle of the interval (middle is defined in a shifted sense for infinite- horizon problems) and dense at the boundaries. The second-order accumulation of points near the boundaries have the effect of wasting nodes. The Bellman pseudospectral method takes advantage of the node accumulation at the initial point to anti-alias the solution and discards the remainder of the nodes. Thus the final distribution of nodes is non-Gaussian and dense while the computational method retains a sparse structure. ==Applications== The Bellman pseudospectral method was first applied by Ross et al. to solve the challenging problem of very low thrust trajectory optimization. It has been successfully applied to solve a practical problem of generating very high accuracy solutions to a trans-Earth-injection problem of bringing a space capsule from a lunar orbit to a pin-pointed Earth-interface condition for successful reentry.H. Yan, Q. Gong, C. D. Park, I. M. Ross and C. N. D'Souza, High-Accuracy Moon to Earth trajectory optimization, AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, 2010. The Bellman pseudospectral method is most commonly used as an additional check on the optimality of a pseudospectral solution generated by the Ross‚ÄìFahroo pseudospectral methods. That is, in addition to the use of Pontryagin's minimum principle in conjunction with the solutions obtained by the Ross‚ÄìFahroo pseudospectral methods, the Bellman pseudospectral method is used as a primal-only test on the optimality of the computed solution. ==See also== *Legendre pseudospectral method *Chebyshev pseudospectral method *Pseudospectral knotting method ==References== Category:Optimal control Category:Numerical analysis Category:Control theory ","title":"Bellman pseudospectral method"},{"id":"35188928","text":"Hugh III (c. 960 - c. 1015) became Count of Maine on his father Hugh II's death, c. 991. ==Life== He was the son of Hugh II, Count of Maine and succeeded his father as Count of Maine Detlev Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 4 (Verlag von J.

(2008). Building an inner sanctuary: trauma-induced symptoms in nonhuman great apes. Journal of Trauma and Dissociation. 9(1); p. 9-34.Bradshaw. G.A. (2010). We, Matata: Bicultural living amongst apes, Spring, 83, 161-183. This work was expanded to parrots, bears, and domestic animals and led to her founding the field of trans-species psychology, the articulation of a vertebrate common model of brain, mind, and behavior that is supported by existing science. ==Discovery of PTSD in elephants and chimpanzees== In 2005, while investigating what was referred to as an outbreak of ‚Äúabnormal behaviors,‚Äù Bradshaw established that in fact African elephants were experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Psychological symptoms included inter- and intra-species aggression, abnormal startle response, depression, mood disorders, and socio-emotional dysfunction, including infant neglect. All were related to a series of human-caused trauma: mass killings, translocations, social disruption, and habitat loss and degradation.Slotow, R. et al. (2000). Nature, 408, 425‚Äì426. Slotow, R., Balfour, D. & Howison, O. (2001) Killing of black and white rhinoceroses by African elephants in Hluhluhe-Umfolozi, South Africa. Pachyderm, 31, 14-20. Her findings were further supported by neuroscience research stating that the brain structures affected by trauma (cortical and subcortical areas of the right brain) are highly conserved across species.Schore, A. N. (2002). Dysregulation of the right brain: a fundamental mechanism of traumatic attachment and the psychopathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder.

The epidemic proportions of elephant PTSD signifies a critical point and portends imminent collapse of elephant societies in Asia and Africa.Bradshaw, G.A. (2005). Elephant trauma and recovery: from human violence to trans- species psychology. dissertation: Pacifica Graduate Institute, Santa Barbara, California. ==Trans-species psychology== Trans-species psychology labels the entirety of standing science that describes a unitary model of brain, mind, and behavior for all animals.Northoff, G. and J. Panksepp, (2008).The trans- species concept of self and the subcortical-cortical midline system. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 12 (7), 259-264. Bradshaw maintains that establishing trans-species psychology as a new field was only necessary to point out the selective use of science. A vast amount of theory and data accumulated since Charles Darwin shows that nonhuman animals are mentally and emotionally comparable to humans, and surpass human abilities in diverse ways.Cantor, C. (2009). Post-traumatic stress disorder: evolutionary perspectives. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 43(11), 1038-1048. doi:10.3109/00048670903270407Bradshaw, G.A. (2009). Transformation through service: trans-species psychology and its implications for ecotherapy. Ecotherapy. (eds.) L. Buzzell and C. Chalquist. Sierra Club, 157-165.Panksepp, J. (1998). Affective neuroscience: The foundations of human and animal emotions. New York: Oxford University Press. However, scientific theory does not explicitly acknowledge this understanding, nor does scientific practice implicitly reflect it. By ignoring human and other animal psychological comparability, the science community encourages cultural and legal subjugation of animals. Trans-species psychology rectifies this inconsistency by eliminating the artificial separation between species and openly bringing knowledge of human psychology to bear on other species.Bradshaw, G.A. & M. Watkins. (2006). Trans-species psychology; theory and praxis. Spring. V. 75, p. 69-94. The affix trans on psychology embeds the human species, without privilege, in the matrix of the animal kingdom. By recognizing human-animal comparability, trans-species psychology situates all species under a single conceptual umbrella - a unitary model of brain, mind, behavior and consciousness.Bradshaw, G.A. 2015. Elephant trauma and recovery: from human violence to trans-species psychology). Doctoral dissertation Pacifica Graduate Institute, Santa Barbara, CA. In so doing, trans-species psychology revolutionizes a new scientific and ethical paradigm that has profound implications for human-animal relationships, culture, ethics, scientific research, and psychological practice. Trans-species psychology provides a scientific basis for the animal rights movement. Scientific evidence supports compelling ethical arguments to provide nonhuman animals with rights comparable to humans. Bradshaw refers to this cultural movement as trans- species living, \\"learning to live like animals again.‚Äù Trans-species living embraces an ethic of being in service to animals in ways that promote animal self-determination and restores animal well-being by supporting their habitats, cultures, individual value, and agency. It disavows the exploitation of animals for profit, entertainment, research, or other gain. ==The Kerulos Center== In 2008, Bradshaw founded The Kerulos Center, in Jacksonville, Oregon, USA, a non-profit organization dedicated to ethical living with non- human nature. The Kerulos Center consists of an international community of faculty members and professional advisors from diverse disciplines working to improve the lives of animals through scientific understanding and service. ==Publications== Bradshaw authored the book, Elephants on the Edge: What Animals Teach Us about Humanity, (Yale University Press, 2009), which discusses the emotional and social lives of elephants. Elephants on the Edge has been distinguished as a 2009 Book of the Year (BOTYA) Gold Medal Award, Winner in Psychology, a Scientific American Favorite Science Books of 2009, a nomination for Pulitzer Prize 2009, an Honorable Mention Award 2009 PROSE, a Psychology (Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers), and an Honorable Mention, 2010 Green Book Festival. Archbishop Desmond M.Tutu, 1984 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate: \\"African peoples and wildlife have been bound together in a delicate network of interdependence since ancient times. The arrival of colonialism tore apart these bonds: human brother now fights against elephant brother, and mothers of both species mourn. Elephants on the Edge is an urgent call to end this strife and for humanity to embrace once more the traditions that kept the peace with our animal kin.\\" Bradshaw is also editor of Minding the Animal Psyche, an anthology covering diverse species from the perspective of trans-species psychology.Bradshaw, G.A.

Its population is about 1,692, excluding Kosinjski Bakovac. ==History== Middle Ages Many Croatian archaeological sites, such as Boƒçaj, Basaric, and Lopar Mlakvena, state that there was evidence of life in the valley since the Roman era. Many medieval and historical records say that the city or Boƒçaj Kosinjgrad or Lasch de Kosin, the princes who reigned the year of our Lord mentions Kosinjski first in the year 1071 in the charter of the Croatian king Petar Kresimir IV. Renaissance One of the oldest printers in south Slavic, that wrote in Glagolitic breviary, was the first and oldest book known to have been printed on Croatian soil using the Gutenberg press. An incomplete copy is kept in the Library Marciana in Venice, and a smaller fragment (six parchment leaves) was discovered in the Vatican Library. A short time after the printing press was invented, founded by the princes Frankopans in the village of Kosinj, the first Croatian printing. It was printed, also for ecclesiastical purposes, and the first Croatian printed book in the year 1483. Kosinj, as a symbol of Croatian culture, has its place in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz, where the first map of printers contains the name of Kosinj. Ottoman Era The Kosinjski area remained after the Turks from the end of thirty Vlach families. They are the Krajina authorities have expressed the wish to remain in their homes. Since the end Kosinjski remained rather poorly populated, Krajina administration has moved here from the Croatian settlers Ogulin and upper Pokuplje. The description Kosinje whom he left Bishop Glaviniƒá 1696th Whatever., says that this place is divided into Upper, Middle and Lower Village. In the Upper Kosinj Glaviniƒá is found forty houses of Croatian immigrants from Pokuplje. In the Middle Kosinj, a hundred houses Vlach population, lived in the Lower Kosinj Croats who moved here from Ogulin. In all three Kosinj village was then about 400 Croats and 300 Blaise. The Border writings known as the surnames of immigrants who are late 17th century welcomed to Denison. In later development Kosinje Central Village changed its name to Zamost. Thus up to now remained only 2 Kosinje, Lower and Upper. The upper creek is about Bakovac and his compositions with the river Lika, and the lower few kilometers further north along the creek mentioned. ==Geography== Kosinj offers a course of the river Lika. The settlement is divided into three villages: * Gornji Kosinj * Donji Kosinj * Kosinjski Bakovac While they belong to the village: Rudinka, Mlakva, linden fields, karst, and Gradina Bakovac. Kosinj is located in the so-called \\"Kosinj Valley\\" which is a karst valley formed erosive action of the forces of the river Lika. In Kosinj there is an artificial reservoir lake Kru≈°ƒáica. The area is full of farmland that contains cattle and canola farming. The character of the river meander (which is 78 km from its second-largest underground river in Europe) that winds up his field abyss Begovac (in literature known as the Markov gap depth 1725 m) were probably caught the biggest carp in Europe. The Lika river abounds in fish resources, as well as the accumulation lake Kruscica (created in 1971, it is suitable for water sports and swimming in calm waters). The variety of wildlife includes catfish and carp also: pike, chub, crvenorepke, white amur, sunstroke, and babushkas. In the Kosinj valley are caves and sinkholes. There are numerous wells and ponds, wells and springs. As one of the symbols of the dominant Kosinje its appearance imposed Kalic mountain peak (969 m) from which magnificent views of the Zavi≈æan, Krasno, parts of Perusic in Kosinj, and a large part of the valley. ==Population== The population in the three parts of Kosinj: *Gornji Kosinj - 192 *Donji Kosinj - 1500 *Kosinjski Bakovac - unknown The Kosinj effect commonly known by depopulation CEMEA Lika is known. It is believed that the total population decreased by as much as 10 times since mid last century, from 12,000. In Kosinj prevails predominantly old population. Young people are increasingly moving out because of the high rate of unemployment. Therefore, the young go to the nearby cities hoping to have a better chance of a job and start a family. ==Culture== Denison is the culture and history is certainly the most important place as the first Croatian printing of books, missals Kosinjski, 1483rd year, which was printed in the mobile shop royalty Anz Frankopan. To date, only ten copies preserved and valuable Glagolitic books, whose circulation was printed partly on paper and partly on parchment. Kosinj printing otisnula is most likely a significant other Croatian incunabula. There is many churches in the area, such as: *Holy Velebit Church *St Vida Church *St Ivanka Church *St John the Baptist Church *Mother of Bozje Church There was evidence of seven churches and two monasteries in Kosinj, written in Glagolitic alphabet. And today many churches in Kosinj, other than those use and enrich the history and heritage to the miraculous chapel in Zakosnjak. The wall of the church of Sv. Vida has three panels of the Glagolitic summer Lord 1517 and is particularly interesting emblem of Prince Anz Frankopan placed upside down above the door. Inside the walls it the church of Sv. John the Baptist (1650) that was fitted with two large square stone urns with Latin inscriptions, and inside the church, there are two large sarcophagus serving as aid treatment or altars. Concrete pedestal of the crucifix of the church cover the stone urns.https://web.archive.org/web/20070622101423/http://demo.ctk- rijeka.hr/Kosinj/Povijest.htm ==ReferencesSources== *Ivan Mance - Kosinj izvori≈°te hrvatske tiskane rijeƒçi, Split, 2013.

He was a relative of the famous Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes. == Early years == He was born in Trujillo to Francisco de Gaeta and Mar√≠a Alonso de Cervantes. He studied at the Santa Cruz de Ca√±izares College of the University of Salamanca and at the University of Paris, and later he was appointed councillor and delegate of the Grand Inquisitor of the Kingdom of Aragon. == Early ecclesiastical career == Cervantes was vicar general of the diocese of Le√≥n,Gaspar Cervantes de Gaeta at the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana Online inquisitor and vicar general of the archdiocese of Seville, and inquisitor in Zaragoza and Naples. In 1561 he was elected archbishop of Messina, and later, in 1566, archbishop of Salerno, where he organized several ecclesial synods. Cervantes participated in the Council of Trent, where he stood out for his eloquence and wisdom, thus winning Pope Pius IV's confidence. This Pope entrusted him ecclesiastical matters of high importance. In 1568 was appointed archbishop of Tarragona, but he did not arrive to Tarragona until 1572. == Archbishop of Tarragona and cardinal == Being archbishop of Tarragona, he was appointed cardinal-priest of Saint Vitale by Pope Pius V in the consistory of May 17, 1570. On March 9 of that year, he changed to the titular church of Saint Martino in Montibus, and in 1572 to Santa Balbina. For this reason, he spent four years in Italy since his appointment at the archdiocese of Tarragona. During his stay in Rome, he was Papal legate for the kingdoms of Spain. Pope Puis V named him a member of the jury that had to try the archbishop of Toledo, Bartolom√© Carranza. Cervantes went back to Tarragona in May 1572. That year he founded the University of Tarragona, to which he donated a total amount of twenty thousand Catalan pounds. On April 16 of 1573, he authorized the village of Almoster to own its own baptismal fonts in its church, which spared its inhabitants the inconvenience of going to Reus for this matter. In 1574, Cervantes got the suppression of the monastery of Escornalbou from Pius V. The money that he got out of it went to the creation of the Seminary of Tarragona, founded in 1575. This seminary is considered the first one in Spain, which later in 1577, it was combined with the University of Tarragona. In 1575 he also founded a novitiate of the Society of Jesus. He also created a penitentiary canonry, founded a residence for Jesuit monks, a hospice for beggars, and invested on the orphanage. He considered that the inner side of the harbour of Tarragona could be assaulted easily, therefore he decided to extend the defenses adding a bastion to the Roman walls that took his name.Centre d'Interpretacions de las Fortificacions de Tarragona He celebrated an ecumenical council from 1572 to 1574. His auxiliary bishop was Joan Ter√®s i Borrull. In 1574, Tarragona underwent an episode of drought, and Cervantes tried to redirect a water channel from Puigdelf√≠. However, Cervantes died before he could finish this project, on October 17, 1575. In 1577, his remains were moved to a tomb between the chapel of Saint Michael and the chapel of the Eleven Thousand Virgins in the Tarragona Cathedral. == Legacy == In Trujillo he ordered to build the altar in Saint Martin‚Äôs Church, where the remains of his mother were placed. The altar is known as the ‚ÄúAltar of Gaeta‚Äù. He gave at least sixteen 16th-century tapestries embroidered in Brussels to the Tarragona Cathedral In his will, Cervantes gave thorough details about the administrative regulation and running of the University of Tarragona, which prevented that, years later, the university was abolished by King Philip V of Spain. Cervantes published a work titled Instruccions, y advertiments molt √∫tils necessaris per les persones ecclesi√†stiques y principalment per als qui tenen cura d‚Äô√†nimes, aix√≠ de com s‚Äôhan de haver en les persones, com ensenyar e instruir a sos parroquians en p√∫blic y en lo secret de la Penitencia (Barcelona, 1575). This work was originally published in Italian, and when he moved to Tarragona, he ordered to translate it into Catalan. Previously he published in Rome, in 1568, the Constituzioni Sinodali della Chiesa di Salerno. Lope de Vega dedicated an epitaph to Cervantes in Epitaphios f√∫nebres a diversos sepulcros.

National Gallery, London L√©al SouvenirAlthough the inscription on the parapet does not contain a diacritic on the e. (also known as Timotheus or Portrait of a Man) is a small oil-on-oak panel portrait by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck, dated 1432. The sitter has not been identified, but his highly individual features suggest a historical person rather than the hypothetical ideal usual at the time in northern Renaissance portraiture;Smith, 42 his slight and unassuming torso is contrasted with a sophisticated facial expression. His features have been described as \\"plain and rustic\\", yet thoughtful and inward-looking. A number of art historians, including Erwin Panofsky, have detected mournfulness in his expression. The sitter was apparently significant enough a member of the Burgundian duke Philip the Good's circle that his court painter portrayed him. The man sits before an imitation parapet with three sets of painted inscriptions, each rendered to look as if chiselled or scratched into stone.Panofsky, 80 Van Eyck did not have full command of either classical Greek or Latin and made errors, so readings by modern scholars vary. The first inscription is in Greek and seems to spell \\"TYŒú.œâŒòŒïŒüœπ\\", which has not been satisfactorily interpreted but has led some to title the work Timotheus. The middle reads in French \\"Leal Souvenir\\" (\\"Loyal Memory\\") and indicates that the portrait is a posthumous commemoration. The third records van Eyck's signature and the date of execution.Bauman, 37 The 19th-century art historian Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert identified the lettering \\"TYŒú.œâŒòŒïŒüC\\"Paviot, 212 with the Greek musician Timotheus of Miletus. Panofsky drew the same conclusion, eliminating other Greeks bearing the name Timothy; they were of religious or military background, professions that do not match the civilian dress of the sitter. Panofsky believed the man was probably a highly placed musician in Philip's court.Wood, 650 More recent research focuses on the legalistic wording in one of the inscriptions, suggesting to some that he was in some way connected to the legal profession, or an employee of Philip the Good. The panel was acquired in 1857 by the National Gallery, London, where it is on permanent display. == Description == L√©al Souvenir is one of the earliest surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of the earliest extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.Smith, 61Jones, 10‚Äì11Borchert, 22 The parapet dominates the portrait, and his head seems oversized compared to his upper body. Some art historians speculate that this is a result of van Eyck's then inexperience; it was only his second known portrait.Although the dual portraits of the donors in his Ghent Altarpiece were probably completed in 1431 or in the early months of the following year. Meiss speculates that van Eyck may have \\"los[t] control of [the] design as a whole by indulging his astounding virtuosity.\\"Meiss, 138  Parapet  Tombstone of the soldier Tiberius Julius Pancuius. See also Fayum mummy portraits. The decayed parapet allows van Eyck to display his skill at mimicking stone chiselling and scarring, and shows the influence of classical Roman funerary art, particularly stone memorials. The parapet gives the work gravitas, the chips and cracks conveying a sense of the venerable, or, according to art historian Elisabeth Dhanens, a sense of the \\"fragility of life or of memory itself\\".  Portrait  Copy of Rogier van der Weyden, Portrait of Philip the Good, 1445. Here, Philip is captured in a similar but inverted pose. As in vanEyck's panel, the scroll is inscribed on the outside with fictive writing.Campbell, 223 The man is positioned within an undefined narrow space and set against a flat black background. Typically for vanEyck, the head is large in relation to the torso. He is dressed in typically Burgundian fashion, with a red robe and a green wool chaperon with a bourrelet and cornette hanging forward. The headdress is trimmed with fur, fastened with two buttons, and extends to the parapet. His right hand might be holding the end of the cornette. Neither the shape of his head nor his facial features correspond to contemporary standard types, let alone canons of ideal beauty. The sitter appears to be bald, although there are some faint traces of fair hair, leading Erwin Panofsky to conclude that his \\"countenance is as 'Nordic' as his dress is Burgundian.\\"Panofsky, 82 Though he has neither eyebrows nor stubble, he does have eyelashes that are believed to have been added by a 19th-century restorer. Van Eyck's cool observation of the man's narrow shoulders, pursed lips, and thin eyebrows extends to detailing the moisture on his blue eyes.Kemperdick, 19 Unlike Rogier van der Weyden, who paid especially close attention to detail in the rendering of his models' fingers, to vanEyck hands were often something of an afterthought.Kemperdick notes that Hans Holbein the Younger \\"used the same pair of hands for many of his portraits, so that they look much the same on 70-year-old William Warham and Anne Lovell, forty years his junior.\\" Kemperdick, 20 They are generically rendered, do not contain much detail and may have been a later workshop addition. Yet they are very similar to those of the sitter in his 1435 Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy. The man holds a scroll that might be a legal document, letter, or pamphlet. In his early portraits, vanEyck's sitters are often shown holding objects indicative of their profession.P√§cht, 110 The scroll contains six lines of illegible writing. The abbreviations are more prominent and seem to be in Latin, but may be vernacular. Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy, 1435. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. VanEyck's early portraits typically show the sitter holding an emblem of his profession and class.Upton, 27 Light falls from the left, leaving traces of shadow on the side of the man's face, a device commonly found in vanEyck's early portraits.Meiss, 137 He is youthful, and his face has a soft fleshiness achieved through shallow curves and flowing, harmonious brushstrokes, giving the appearance of a relaxed, warm, and open personality, which Meiss describes as evoking an almost \\"Rembrandtesque warmth and sympathy\\". The sitter is not handsome; he has a flattish face, a stubby yet pointed nose, and prominent cheekbones that might, according to Panofsky, belong to a \\"Flemish peasant\\".Panofsky, 88 Dhanens describes him as having an honest expression.Dhanens, 182 A number of art historians have noted the apparent contradiction between the man's plain looks and enigmatic expression. Meiss describes him as \\"plain and rustic\\", and finds a resemblance between his rather generic face and a number of figures in the lower portions of the \\"Adoration of the Lamb\\" panel in the Ghent Altarpiece.Meiss, 144 Agreeing with Panofsky, he observes a \\"thoughtfulness on the high, wrinkled forehead, visionary force in the dreamy yet steady eyes, [and] a formidable strength of passion in the wide, firm mouth\\". According to Panofsky, the man's face is not that of an intellectual, yet he detects a pensive and lonely nature, \\"the face of one who feels and produces rather than observes and dissects\\".  Inscriptions and identity of the sitter  Detail showing the three inscriptions The parapet has three horizontal rows of inscriptions; on the upper and lower rows is smaller lettering that is often not visible in reproductions. In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, not least due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing. The top lettering is in chalk white and Greek script that reads \\"TYŒú.œâŒòŒïŒüC\\". The last character is deliberately concealed by a chip in the imitation stone, a touch described by Panofsky as a \\"terminal flourish\\". This makes the meaning of the inscription difficult to discern. A general consensus among art historians is that the final character is a square C or sigma sign. \\"TYŒú.œâŒòŒïŒüC\\" was interpreted in 1857 by Charles Eastlake as \\"Timotheos\\", a proper name.However, if this were the intended meaning, more correct lettering would have read \\"TIM.OŒòEOC\\". See Paviot, 214Paviot, 214 Campbell points out that vanEyck \\"appears to have employed the Greek alphabet systematically\\", and always employed the square sigma C for the Latin \\"S\\", and a majuscule omega œâ (in the uncial form) for the Latin \\"O\\". The inscription may be meant to read \\"Honour God\\", or \\"Be Honoured, OGod\\", as written in the passive imperative.Paviot, 215 Panofsky gives some consideration to the hypothesis that the final letter is a \\"N\\", and that the lettering forms two words rather than one. In this interpretation, the letters spell TYŒúœâ ŒòŒïŒüN, meaning \\"Honour God\\". While this would be more straightforward than \\"Timotheus\\", he rejects the possibility. He writes that \\"the presence of a shorter horizontal line connecting with the slightly tapering top of the vertical stroke and completing it into a Œì form ... evidently precludes a \\"N\\".Panofsky, 80‚Äì81 Dhanens suggests the inscription can be read as \\"Time Deum\\" (\\"Fear God\\"), a known motto of the Vilain family. Detail showing the uppermost inscription. Note the punctuation after the third character, and the deliberately obscured final character. Eastlake's translation is generally accepted. The possibility of it being a variant of \\"Timothy\\" has been discounted, as that word was not used in Northern Europe before the Reformation. There is no Germanic name that might imply a humanistic imitation of a Greek word,Panofsky, 81 so art historians have sought to identify the man from Greek history or legend. Although some have suggested certain Athenian and Syrian generals, these have been discounted as the sitter is not wearing military clothing.Panofsky, 82 Saint Timothy, first Bishop of Ephesus and an associate of Saint Paul, has been suggested but eliminated as the man is not dressed as a high cleric. Martin le Franc, Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois, 1440s The larger middle inscription is in French, using a 12th-century script. It reads \\"LEAL SOVVENIR\\" (Loyal Remembrance, or Faithful Souvenir),Bauman, 35 and is painted to give the impression that it was carved into the parapet. In 1927 Hippolyte Fierens Gevaert put forward Timotheus of Miletus, a Greek musician and dithyrambic poet born 446. Gevaert held that the portrait was a commemoration of a court artist who had recently died and that the classical reference was intended to flatter his memory. Panofsky largely went with this position in 1949. He speculated that the sitter was the celebrated musician Gilles Binchois, by 1430 a canon at St. Donatian's Cathedral, Bruges. Campbell is sceptical, disclaiming that the sitter \\"is not dressed as a cleric\\".Campbell, 220 Other theories include that the man was a Greek or Lucchese merchant, Henry the Navigator, Jean deCro√ø or, less likely, that it is a self-portrait. Though there is much disagreement, it is probable that he was a native French speaker, and a notary, poet, or member of the Compagnie du Chapel Vert (\\"Society of the Green Hat\\") at Tournai.Campbell, 220 Dhanens rejects the theory that the man was a musician on the basis that vanEyck would have made this explicit, portraying him holding a device or emblem clearly symbolising music. She concludes that he is an accountant or lawyer holding a legal or financial document.Dhanens, 184 From the first two inscriptions, the panel is generally accepted as a posthumous portrait. Roman tombstones often showed a representation of the deceased behind a parapet with a carved inscription, and vanEyck may have known of these from travels to France. The lower inscription reads \\"Actu[m] an[n]o d[omi]ni.1432.10.die octobris.a.ioh[anne] de Eyck\\" (Finished in the year of our Lord 1432 on the 10th day of October by Jan vanEyck). Campbell observes that the phrasing of this extended signature is surprisingly reminiscent of legalese, and that vanEyck seems to be reinforcing the idea that the man was a legal professional,Campbell, 222 who may have worked for the Dukes of Burgundy.Borchert, 36 Jacques Paviot notes that it is written in the Gothic cursive script bastarda, then favoured by the legal profession. In either case, although he is not grandly dressed and is probably a member of the middle class, he must have been highly regarded in Philip's court, given that such portraits rarely depicted non-nobles. == Condition == The panel consists of a single oak board, cut vertically down close to the painted surface. It has a small unpainted area at the upper left. The support's encasing was probably changed in the 19th century; today four of the eight supports are fixed to the edges of the interior borders, forming inner mouldings. The other four act as inner pins. The varnish is severely degraded, with key areas of paint and ground either removed or overpainted. Infrared photography of the reverse reveals traces of short vertical hatching and underdrawings, but no hint as to the identity of the sitter. Its ground is mostly chalk-based; the pigments are predominantly blacks, red lake, and blues. The final portrait differs in many ways from the underdrawing ‚Äì the fingers are shorter, the right thumb and the parapet are lower, and the right arm once extended over a larger area. In the final portrait, the ear is elevated, and the scroll occupies a larger pictorial space. Analysis of the pigment shows that the flesh of his face is painted with whites and vermilion, and traced with greys, blacks, blues, and some ultramarine over a red-lake glaze.Campbell, 218 The portrait is not particularly well preserved. There are yellowish layers of glaze over the face, probably later additions. The varnishes have degraded and lost their original colours. The panel has undergone a number of detrimental retouchings. In some instances, these have altered the sitter's appearance, most especially the removal of strands of fair hair below the chaperon. It has sustained structural damage, especially to the marble on the reverse. The National Gallery repaired some \\"slight injuries\\" when it came into their possession in 1857. Campbell notes a number of efforts by later restorers were imperfect and \\"rather disfiguring\\", including touchings to the man's nostrils and eyelashes, and the tip of his nose. There is a yellowish glaze over the eyes that seems to be either damage or overpaint. The panel is discoloured overall and suffers from aged and degenerated varnishes that make the original pigments hard to discern. == Provenance == Petrus Christus, Portrait of a Carthusian, 1446. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Follower of Jan vanEyck, Portrait of Marco Barbarigo, 1449‚Äì1450. National Gallery, London The painting was widely copied and imitated during the 15thcentury. Near-contemporary copper reproductions are known from Bergamo and Turin. Petrus Christus borrowed the illusionistic carving on the parapet for his 1446 Portrait of a Carthusian.\\"Jan van Eyck\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 18 October 2014 A 1449‚Äì1450 portrait of Marco Barbarigo attributed to a follower of vanEyck is also heavily indebted to L√©al Souvenir in that it is also unusually tall and narrow, with a large space above the sitter's head. The painting is first recorded in the notes of Charles Eastlake, the National Gallery's collector and later director, in 1857, the year it was acquired. He mentions that it had been in the possession of the Scottish landscape painter Karl Ross (1816‚Äì1858) \\"before 1854\\". Like many of vanEyck's works and those of the Early Netherlandish painters in general, the painting's provenance is murky before the 19thcentury. When the National Gallery was verifying attribution, the two copper reproductions were noted. The first was found by Eastlake in the collection of the Lochis family of Bergamo in Italy, the second in Turin, belonging to Count Castellane HarrachLorenzo Lotto's Portrait of Laura da Pola at the Pinacoteca Brera was also formerly in the Castellane Harrach collection, according to the [ Pinacoteca Brera website]. and described as smaller than the original, and \\"very weak\\". Both are now lost. Ink markings on the marble reverse show a small cross that may record a merchant's mark or emblem. Although it is incomplete and no identification has been made, W.H.J. Weale detected the mark of \\"an early Italian, probably Venetian owner\\".Weale, 109 An early provenance in Italy would not imply that the man came from that country; vanEyck's works were often purchased by collectors from that region. == References ==  Notes   Sources  * Bauman, Guy. \\"Early Flemish Portraits 1425‚Äì1525\\".

It is the eighth entry in the Drenai series. It is also the second of three stories that feature in the anthology Drenai Tales Volume Three. The story is set several decades after Gemmell's earlier title, Quest for Lost Heroes and introduces an entirely new set of characters. ==Plot summary== The Drenai army, lead by Emperor Skanda, has conquered the hostile Ventrian empire. A man of great charm and even greater ambition, Skanda has unified the two historically hostile people by marrying the Ventrian emperor's daughter, Axiana, who is now pregnant. He has allied with his former enemies, including prince Malikada and his bodyguard and right-hand man, the master swordsman Antikas Karios. Convinced that he needs young men to furnish him with further victories, Skanda unites the Ventrian and Drenai forces and forcibly retires all of the older Drenai soldiers. These include Banelion, the White Wolf, the legendary Drenai general, and three old friends: Nogusta the swordsman, Kebra the archer, and Bison the wrestler. Unbeknownst to all but a few, demons have begun to haunt the imperial city of Usa, their malign influence driving men to commit atrocities. Dagorian, a young staff officer loyal to the White Wolf, investigates a series of murders but runs afoul of prince Malikada's political machinations and is marked for death. Dagorian hides, surviving by his wits. Nogusta, a master swordsman and tracker, is dispatched to hunt down some Drenai who committed murder and rape. One of them is a friend of Bison's and claims demonic possession is responsible for his uncharacteristic actions. Nogusta does not believe him and carries out the sentence, though he allows the man an honorable death. On his return to the city, Nogusta experiences the first of several visions. A black man and an outsider in the Drenai empire, Nogusta bears a family talisman that sometimes gives him glimpses of the future. Used to prejudice, Nogusta is fiercely loyal to those who know him well, including his friends Kebra and Bison, and his mentor, the general Banelion. Nogusta returns to Usa, but says nothing about his visions. Nogusta and his friends compete in the games held in honor of Skanda's birthday. Shortly thereafter, they are demobilized from the army for being too old. This is especially difficult for Bison, a man of great strength, crude habits, and simple thinking. The three decide to prospect for gold in the nearby hills, rather than march off with Banelion and the other forcibly retired soldiers. In the city, the priestess Ulmenetha, who is handmaid to the empress Axiana, uses her mystic powers to investigate the chaos and violence growing in the city. While in spirit form she is attacked by demons, but is saved by a mysterious figure made of light. To her horror, she learns that the old emperor, Axiana's father, was not slain in battle but was instead sacrificed in a dark ritual. Shortly thereafter the Ventrian army, lead by prince Malikada, betrays and murders the Drenai army. Emperor Skanda is similarly sacrificed. The architect of these dark plans is the demon lord Anharat. Thousands of years ago Anharat and his people the Windborn ruled over men and fed upon them like cattle. The Windborn were all spirit creatures and ranged from good spirits like dryads to creatures of bloodshed and pain. Anharat's twin brother, the demon lord Emsharas, betrayed his people and joined three human kings rebelling against the Windborn. At the height of a great battle Emsharas cast a mighty spell that cast all the Windborn, including his brother Anharat, back into the formless void. Emsharas then disappeared for millennia, although he did father children upon a mortal woman. Nogusta is in fact the last living descendant of Emsharas, in part because Anharat conspired to have the rest of them murdered. Now Anharat seeks to reverse Emsharas' great spell by sacrificing three kings, allowing the Windborn to take material form and enslave humanity once again. Two of the kings have already fallen and the last is about to be born to Axiana. Ulmenetha realizes too late that the unsuspecting Axiana has been captured by agents of Anharat. She rescues her alongside Dagorian, whose own investigations made him realize Axiana was in danger. Usa's population begins to riot and murder, driven mad by the growing strength of the demons. Dagorian, Ulmenetha, and the heavily pregnant empress Axiana flee the city in a wagon, taking with them three children they saved from being sacrificed. Anharat murders and then possesses prince Malikada. He sends Antikas Karios back to the city to re-capture the empress, but the swordsman is troubled by the chaos and slaughter he finds there and begins to investigate. The figure made of light begins to guide and protect him. Ventrian cavalry officers sent by Malikada/Anharat catch the slow moving wagon in the hills outside of Usa, and Dagorian prepares to die to save his queen. Instead, they are saved by the arrival of Nogusta and Kebra, who easily kill the soldiers. The two groups join forces, for Nogusta's visions have prepared him for what is to come. Sadly, they also show him that several of the companions will die, including one of his dearest friends. Knowing this but not knowing whether they have any chance of success, he still agrees to protect the unborn king. Back in Usa, the city population is decimated by rioting and bloodshed. Anharat uses this dark energy to summon some of the strongest demons from the void: the Krayakin. These ten soldiers are unclean spirits who feast on endless bloodshed, each responsible for thousands of deaths. Alone, each is deadlier than any but the greatest of human warriors, and together they are nearly unstoppable. They cannot be killed by steel, though they are vulnerable to natural elements like wood and running water. Tracking the queen's protectors by their spirit essence, they begin their hunt. The prophecy was clear. Upon the death of three kings the world will be plunged into chaos, and all the cast-out demons of history will return to establish a new age of darkness. Two of the kings are dead. The third, about to be born, is hunted by the Demon Riders of the Krayakin, Lords of the Undead. All the terrifying forces of evil range against a pregnant queen at bay in a haunted forest. But she is not alone. Three warriors stand with her, the last remnants of the once proud Drenai army. Three old men, ancient heroes, discarded by the king: Nogusta the Swordsman, Kebra the Bowman, and the hulking fighter, Bison. The fate of empires rests on their fading skills as they journey through a tormented world on a perilous quest to save the unborn king. ==Characters== Nogusta - A Drenai swordmaster carrying a magic talisman which gives the owner visions of the future.

The purpose of the vedette is to entertain and captivate the public. The vedette has to know how to sing, dance and act on stage. Particularly accomplished artistes are considered super vedettes or first vedettes. Vedettes often appear alongside groups of dancers, flashy and revealing costumes, magicians, comedians, jugglers, or even performing animals. Vedettes specializing in burlesque generally do striptease and may also perform nude on stage. In the 20th century, vedette shows were successful in the cabarets, theaters and nightclubs of countries such as Spain, France, Argentina and Mexico. Paris and Las Vegas were considered the main cradle of the vedettes. ==Etymology== Vedette is a French word originally used to designate an artist of great fame and notoriety. The term underwent changes over the years. From the early twentieth century, it began to be used to designate the main female artists of the shows of a cabaret such as burlesque, vaudeville, music hall or revue. The zenith of fame and popularity of these women coincided with various historical moments of 20th century sexual liberation: the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s. The vedettes began their rise in popularity in France at the beginning of the 20th century. After France, they have gained greater popularity in Latin countries, both in Europe (Spain) and North and South America (Argentina and Mexico), where they caused a furor in the nightlife at different times. The term is little used in Anglo-Saxon countries, although in the United States there are very popular shows of cabaret and burlesque in the city of Las Vegas, where it is often confused with so-called showgirls. Venues such as Le Lido, the Moulin Rouge, and the Crazy Horse in France, the Teatro Maipo and the Teatro El Nacional in Argentina, and the Teatro de la Ciudad \\"Esperanza Iris\\" in Mexico are or were famous for their vedette shows. ==Europe== France Le Lido of Paris France is considered the cradle of vedettes worldwide. Its capital, Paris, has been home to some of the most famous cabarets in the world. Among these are the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Berg√®re de Paris, pioneers of night shows in which the vedettes appeared on the scene half naked and doing Tableau vivant. Other famous venues are the Le Lido and Bataclan, also famous for their vaudeville and revues. In more recent times, the Crazy Horse also became a notable cabaret. Famous French vedettes included the \\"Three Graces\\" of the Belle √âpoque: √âmilienne d'Alen√ßon, Liane de Pougy, and La Bella Otero. The famous Mistinguett became one of the most popular French artists of her time while Madame Rasimi is remembered as the founder of the Bataclan. Another outstanding figure was Gina Palerme. At the beginning of the 20th century, the novelist Colette also performed in revue. Another prominent figure of that time was the world-famous Dutch spy Mata Hari. The legendary Cl√©o de M√©rode of the Folies Berg√®re was another of the great stars. Mistinguett at the Moulin Rouge Jos√©phine Baker, of American origin, is remembered as one of the most important vedettes. Her \\"Revue N√®gre\\", which included a jazz orchestra, caused a sensation. Her exotic dance form, her uninhibited sexuality and her minimal dress (which included a skirt made of bananas) were more attractive to Europeans than to Americans. She became the star of Parisian nights and even opened her own club, Chez Josephine. Another important figure was Coccinelle, considered the first transsexual vedette in history. The actress and singer Liliane Montevecchi stood out as vedette in the Folies Berg√®re in the 1970s, and eventually conquered Broadway. Another figure of the time was the Italian Xenia Monty. In recent times the vedette shows have emphasized figures like Arielle Dombasle (known as the vedette-like Dolor√®s Sugar Rose) and Marl√®ne Mourreau. Spain La Bella Otero in an 1894 Folies Berg√®re poster One of the first vedettes that stood out in Spain are La Bella Otero, a celebrated courtesan who settled in France, one of the most outstanding personages of the Belle √âpoque in the artistic circles and the gallant life of Paris; Luisa Esteso, famous comedian actress; Encarnaci√≥n Fern√°ndez, who had most of her career in Argentina; Celia G√°mez (of Argentine origin), one of the most popular stars of Spain in the first half of the twentieth century, and who owes much of the splendor of the Revues; Paquita Garz√≥n; Rosario Guerrero (called \\"The Beautiful Guerrero\\"); Rosita Rodrigo; Tina de Jarque, Rosario Soler \\"La Patita\\", Paquita Escribano, Carmen T√≥rtola Valencia, specialist in oriental dances and pioneer of women's liberation, and the sisters Laura and Victoria Pinillos. The 1940s highlighted figures such as Trini Alonso, Mar√≠a Antinea (also famous in Argentina and Mexico); Maruja Boldoba, Florinda Chico, Gema del Rio, the popular Manolita Chen and her company; Teresita Silva; Maruja Tom√°s and Helga Lin√©. The 1950s highlighted stars like Mary Bego√±a, one of the comedic actresses par excellence of the Spanish scene; Licia Calder√≥n, Queta Claver (that became one of the major vedettes of Spain); Raquel Daina; Marujita D√≠az, considered as the \\"Queen of the Copla\\" and \\"Queen of the Spanish Music Revue\\" and Carmen de Lirio, famous during the dictatorship. In the sixties, famous figures such as Mary Santpere, called \\"La Reina del Paralelo\\" (The Queen of the Parallel) reached the fame of Barcelona's homonymous street, where the greatest number of theaters were concentrated in the 20th century; Rosita Amores, pioneer of the erotic cabaret in the mid-1960s, and who knew how to outwit Franco's censorship in times when eroticism in Spain was confined to the private sphere, becoming a popular symbol of entertainment in the Valencian Community; Marisol Ayuso; Ingrid Garbo, of German origin; Vicky Lagos; Vicky Lusson; Katia Loritz; Esperanza Roy, and Lina Morgan, one of the country's most momentous comic strips. Sara Montiel, deserves special mention, who along with her prestigious film career, excelled in shows as a vedette from this decade. In the 1970s Mar√≠a Jos√© Cantudo starred in the first full-length female nude (seen through a mirror) of Spanish cinema; Eva Le√≥n Conde and Barbara Rey were also popular vedettes of the period. From the 1980s and 1990s stand out figures such as Lita Claver \\"La Ma√±a\\"; Norma Duval, one of the last stars of the traditional magazine, a type of spectacle that during those years was in decline and that was maintained mainly thanks to the tourists who visited Paris; Tania Doris, another one of the last representatives of the sort in Spain ; Paloma Hurtado, Mar√≠a Jos√© Nieto \\"Maripepa\\", Rosa Valenty, Africa Pratt and the French Marl√®ne Mourreau. In the last years they have emphasized figures like La Terremoto de Alcorc√≥n and the transsexual actresses ¬¥Bibiana Fernandez, La Veneno and La Prohibida. ==The Americas== Argentina N√©lida Roca and Susana Gim√©nez, two famous vedettes of different generations, in the early 1970s. Revue shows were popularized in Buenos Aires from the 1920s, mainly in the Teatro Maipo. Tita Merello became one of the most famous vedettes of the time.Article about Tita Merello in La Naci√≥n In the 1950s vedettes of Cuban origin appeared, like Blanquita Amaro Amelia Vargas and Rosita Forn√©s.Rosita Forn√©s Official page They had all the glitz, grace and glamor that characterized the era, and shared the stage with local stars like N√©lida Roca. In the 1960s appeared figures like Zulma Faiad, N√©lida Lobato, Susana Brunetti, Norma Pons, Egle Mart√≠n and the Puerto Rican Iris Chac√≥n, called the \\"Vedette of America\\". The 1970s and 1980s gave way to other stars like Graciela Alfano and the sisters Ethel and Gog√≥ Rojo. Others who arose at that time and remained in force in the following years were Susana Gim√©nez Moria Cas√°n and Bettina Vard√©.and the men-vedette Jorge Perez Evelyn. In the 1990s, new vedettes appeared, some of whose fame would spread to the next decade, such as Cris Mir√≥, Mar√≠a Fernanda Callej√≥n, the Puerto Rican Lourdes Chac√≥n and Monica Ayos. In the first years of the 21st century there is a return of the revues in the Avenida Corrientes with figures like Florencia de la V, Mar√≠a Eugenia Rit√≥, Adabel Guerrero, and Valeria Archim√≥. Mexico Lupe V√©lez The image of the Vedette in Mexico arises from the beginning of the 20th century with the rise of the called \\"Carpas\\" and the Revues. Some venues such as Teatro Principal, the Teatro Col√≥n and the Teatro Arbeu were considered as the cathedral of the revues and burlesque in Mexico City. There arise figures like Lupe V√©lez, who, before being consecrated as a star in Hollywood, was considered one of the queens of the frivolous theater. The maximum figure of the time was Maria Conesa \\"The White Kitten\\", who also had a very long career spanning theater, film and television. Other outstanding figures of the time were Esperanza Iris, Celia Montalv√°n, Lupe Rivas Cacho, Amparo Arozamena, Prudencia Grifell, Celia Padilla, Delia Maga√±a, Lupe Incl√°n, Aurora Walker, Amelia Wilhelmy and Mim√≠ Derba, among others. Conesa, Montalv√°n and Rivas Cacho, were even immortalized in a famous foxtrot called Mi querido capit√°n (My dear captain). In the 1950s saw a resurgence of nightlife in Mexico City. Venues like the Tivoli, the Waikik√≠, the Margo (after the Teatro Blanquita), the Follies Bergere and the Teatro L√≠rico, among others, became the main forums for the blossoming of the vedettes. Special mention should be made of the Exoticas, a group of vedettes that caused fury in Mexico's nightlife in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These \\"Exoticas\\" were characterized by using extravagant names, and their shows included African, Tahitian or Oriental dances. The most famous of the \\"Exoticas\\" was Yolanda Montes \\"Tongolele\\", one of the most important dancers of Latin America, and has been in force for more than sixty years. Together with Tongolele, the most famous were Su Muy Key The Chinese Doll, and Kalantan. Another famous \\"Ex√≥ticas\\" were Trudi Bora, Turanda, Joyce Cameron, Tanabonga, Tundra, Gemma, Eda Lorna, Kurumba, Bongala, Tula Montenegro, Brenda Conde, Josefina del Mar and Nan√°. Parallel to the success of the Exoticas, they appear in Mexico the famous \\"Rumberas\\", dancers of Afro-American rhythms. The Rumberas managed to create their own cinematographic genre: The Rumberas film In the called Golden Age of Mexican cinema. The Rumberas films reflected in many of its arguments the life of the women in the night centers and cabarets. The main exponents of the genre were the Cubans Mar√≠a Antonieta Pons, Amalia Aguilar, Nin√≥n Sevilla and Rosa Carmina as well the Mexican Meche Barba. These women were complete vedettes who never needed to explicitly teach their bodies, captivating audiences only with their dances and other stage talents. The Rumberas also performed shows and live performances in important venues. With the decline of the Rumberas film in the mid-fifties, some rumberas broadened their horizons and ventured into vedette shows. Particularly remembered are the live shows of Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina, who even filled stadiums in various countries in Central and South America. The Cuban Rosita Forn√©s deserves special mention. She reaches the final consecration in Mexico before conquering the rest of the continent. In the 1960s the splendor of the vedettes in Mexico lost force. Even so, worthy of mention are the shows offered in venues such as the Blanquita Theater or \\"El Patio\\" by the stars such as Sonia Furi√≥, Ana Luisa Peluffo and Ana Bertha Lepe. In the midst of the fury of the Rock and Roll era, were famous figures like Mal√∫ Reyes and Emily Cranz. Actresses such as Jacqueline Voltaire and Ir√°n Eory also performed shows as vedettes. The 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of the vedettes in Mexico, thanks to a massive revival of nightlife in the country's capital. Mexico City was flooded with nightclubs, cabarets of all levels and burlesque theaters where the vedettes began to bloom. Among the most important nightclubs that illuminated the capital of the country are the Terazza Casino, the Capri (from the Hotel Regis), the Imperial, the Minuet, the Rio Rosa, La Fuente, El Conjunto Marrakech, La Copa de Champagne, El Cordiale, El Rondinella, El Cl√≥set, El Quid, El 77, the Impala Bar and the Belvedere of the Hilton Continental Hotel. Some cabarets such as La Burbuja, Montparnasse, Las Fabulosas, El Can-Can, Los Globos, King Kong and Savoy also reached a great boom, while theaters like El Iris, El Blanquita and the Teatro Fru Fru presented burlesque shows, where the shows were more audacious and explicit. In addition, thanks to television, movies and magazines, the vedettes in Mexico reached their highest point of popularity. Many of them also ventured into the cinema, within the so-called Mexican sex comedy. On the other hand, the popular television program Variedades de medianoche (Varieties of the Midnight) contributed to the boom of these women and launched to the fame to dozens of them.

In the year 2016, the filmmaker Mar√≠a Jos√© Cuevas made the documentary Beauties of the Night, which portrays the life of five of these great vedettes. One of the last great vedettes in Mexico was Francis Garc√≠a, a transvestite artist who was the main star of the Teatro Blanquita for more than a decade. In recent years, large night centers have virtually disappeared from Mexico. Some actresses and singers perform shows of vedettes in other venues, such as the Palenques.

Artistic depiction of the 19th century. Antonio de Villarroel y Pelaez (1656, Barcelona - 1726, A Coru√±a) was a Spanish military commander in the service of Philip V until 1710 in the War of the Spanish Succession. After the disgrace of the Duke of Orl√©ans, he switched to the Habsburg cause of Charles VI, keeping his rank. In 1713 he was appointed general commander of the Army of Catalonia. ==Military career== He joined the army at a very young age, and in 1697, he defended Barcelona against a French army. At the beginning of the War of Spanish Succession, he fought with the army of Philip V, but the fall from grace of the Duke of Orl√©ans forced him to Galicia where he joined the Allied anti- Borb√≥n league. He was there appointed a deputy marshal for the Archduke Charles VI. Once in the service of the Habsburgs, he distinguished himself in the Battle of Villaviciosa and in the thankless task of evacuation of Aragon in 1711. In recognition of his accomplishments, he was appointed supreme commander of the forces of Catalonia and was charged with organizing city defenses in the 1713-14 Siege of Barcelona. With just over 5,000 men, of whom about 3,500 were members of the guild militia, Villarroel was forced to defend the city against some 40,000 mixed French and Spanish supporters of Phillip V. As the summer of 1714 passed, desperate times in Barcelona forced Villarroel to attempt to force an exit of the city. The attempted exit was repulsed by the Duke of Berwick who had replaced the Duke of Popoli as commander of the besiegers. By September, the Franco-Spanish forces had opened a sizable breach in the walls and the city counselors pleaded with Villarroel to capitulate the city to the Duke of Berwick. Refusing to surrender the city, Villarroel continued defending the city until he was injured, whereupon the city was officially surrendered to the forces of Phillip V. Despite assurances given contrary to the fact, the 25 military commanders of Barcelona's defenses, including Villarroel, were all imprisoned. ==Imprisonment and death== Villarroel was imprisoned first in the castle of Alicante and later (1715) in A Coru√±a, where he died (22 February 1726). He spent his last years confined in a cell that flooded with the rising tide, circumstance that caused a total paralysis of his two legs.\\"Qu√® se'n va fer dels herois de la Guerra de Successi√≥?\\": S√†piens; n√∫m. 89; mar√ß 2010; p. 31; ed.

Until then, it was considered that Villarroel had been released from the Alcazar of Segovia following the peace of Vienna and had lived in the pension that would have granted, until his death, the Archduke Charles Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. ==Legacy== A street in the l'Eixample district of modern Barcelona is named after Villarroel.

Produced by The Asylum, and starring Bill Oberst Jr., the film was released direct-to-video on May 29, 2012, following its May 28 theatrical premiere screening at the Telfair Museum of Art Jepson Center in Savannah, Georgia. In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, the film is a mockbuster of the 20th Century Fox film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. ==Plot== After his mother Nancy Lincoln (Rhianna Van Helton), falls victim to an illness that requires her to be tied to her bed, vicious and cannibalistic, 10-year-old Abe Lincoln (Brennen Harper) sees his father Thomas Lincoln (Kent Igleheart) commit suicide at her bedside. Taking up a scythe, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak. When an adult Abraham Lincoln (Bill Oberst Jr.) has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established secret service to accompany him in investigating the fort. They get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivors led by General Stonewall Jackson (Don McGraw) as well as by several of the infected people. Abe kills one of his men who had been bitten by an infected and explains to the others in his party that if they are bitten or scratched by an infected, or if an infected's blood makes contact with their mouths or eyes, that they too will become infected and, within twenty-four hours, would no longer be considered \\"human\\". More are lost when attempting to investigate the surrounding neighborhood, and Abe encounters an old flame turned prostitute Mary Owens (Baby Norman) who is sheltering her help, including a young Theodore Roosevelt (Canon Kuipers), daughter Sophia (Hannah Bryan) and prostitute Annika (Anna Fricks) to protect them from the invasion. The group makes their way back to the fort where Jackson refuses to kill the infected, believing them to only be sick and in need of care. He claims Lincoln's actions are only against the members of the Confederacy. Based on an old Bantu word he'd learned from his mother, Agent Brown (Jason Hughley) names the infected persons \\"zombies\\". Pat Garrett (Christopher Marrone) volunteers to help Abe, and guides them to a nearby plantation that has farming implements and other weapons they can use to combat the threat. When returning to the fort, Mary is splashed in the face with zombie blood and soon falls ill. Meanwhile, agent John Wilkinson (Jason Vail) protests the killing and asks to remain behind as the rest of the group heads into the township to kill off the infected. Being greatly outnumbered, only Abe, Theodore, and Sophia return when the others are slaughtered. Wilkinson, who is revealed to be a spy, plots to kill Lincoln while he is alone but changes his mind when he catches Abe praying, as in his mind prayer would ensure Lincoln's soul going to heaven. After being convinced by Pat Garrett that Lincoln is right and escape is unlikely, Stonewall shows Abe a secret cache of gunpowder. They then decide to use the explosive to blow up the fort after trapping and containing the zombies inside. When the fuse goes out, Stonewall ventures down alone to re-light it, but is over-run and killed by the zombies just after doing so. Abe and Brown escape just in time and the entire place goes up. Mary accepts her fate and goes off with Lincoln to die, much to Sophia's heartbreak. Eighteen months later, Abe goes to visit Mary who had been in the care of a doctor investigating the illness in vain hope of finding a cure. As Abe cleans wounds caused by her restraining shackles, Mary grabs his hand, scratching his skin, infecting him (much to his horror), and forcing him to kill her. Knowing he is himself incurable, Abe requests that a message be sent to John Wilkinson, as earlier he had discovered that Wilkinson was actually John Wilkes Booth who had a plot to kidnap Lincoln in response to the end of the war and the Union the victor. The message gives Booth the information to know exactly where Lincoln would be the following night at the theater, thus leading to his assassination (purposely arranged by Lincoln to prevent another outbreak) at Booth's hands. ==Cast== * Bill Oberst Jr. as Abraham Lincoln * Chris Hlozek as Major John McGill * Jason Hughley as Wilson Brown * Jason Vail as John Wilkes Booth * Don McGraw as General Stonewall Jackson * Christopher Marrone as Pat Garrett * Ron Ogden as Robert Chamberlin * Chip Lane as Joshua Kearney * Canon Kuipers as Young Theodore Roosevelt * Kent Igleheart as Thomas Lincoln * Rhianna Van Helton as Nancy Lincoln * David Alexander as Edward Everett * Bernie Ask as Edwin Stanton * Debra Crittenden as Mary Todd Lincoln * Kennedy Brice as Little Zombie Girl * Claire Weinstein as Zombie Girl in the Closet ==Production== Casting took place in January 2012. Using mostly local talent, filming began on January 28 in Savannah, Georgia. Originally the script was set to shoot at a fort in Tennessee, but Savannah and Fort Pulaski were subsequently chosen for location shooting of scenes where Lincoln confronts zombies who had overrun a Confederate stronghold. ==Critical response== The choice of Bill Oberst Jr. in the lead role of Abraham Lincoln in Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies has been praised, with criticisms otherwise aimed at the film's plot, supporting cast members, character development, and historical inaccuracies. Jason Adams of JoBlo wrote that the film was what might be anticipated from The Asylum, in its being \\"extremely repetitive\\" and having a script filled with \\"terrible lines.\\" Adams stated that the actors \\"pretty much suck post-colonial wastewater\\", except for Bill Oberst Jr. Scott Foy of Dread Central offered similar praise for Oberst's acting, but \\"overwritten dialogue scenes, wildly uneven pacing, and sometimes confusingly staged action scenes prevent Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies from fully living up to its full potential.\\" KDVR reported that in the film, director Richard Schenkman had created \\"an enjoyable little movie that is juuussttt this close to being great camp\\". Jessica Leigh Lebos of Connect Savannah wrote, \\"Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies is terrible. In the best possible way.\\" Lebos said Bill Oberst Jr. \\"gives a believable turn as Lincoln-as-badass while imbuing the character with the president‚Äôs signature stalwart leadership; his Gettysburg Address is so compelling, you might forget you‚Äôre watching a monster movie.\\" Whitney Scott Bain of Starburst called Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies is \\"a sluggishly directed film from a weak script\\" but \\"aside from all the historical inaccuracies, laborious direction and bad script, it's Bill Oberest Jr's stand out performance as Abe Lincoln that steals the show.

Regardless of the rank, professors in public universities (and in many private ones) must perform research. This ranking system is the one used at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (the largest Argentine university) and by most of the public universities, but not all of them; being autonomous, they can choose their own scale. Private universities have their own rank in each case, sometimes based on the public university system, although as a general rule they have less ranks or hold a higher ranking as the starting point for a teaching career (devoting auxiliar ranks to undergraduates). ==Main professorships== * Honorary degree, the professor has the same duties and rights as a Professor Titular. * * * (The lowest rank for a professor to be head of a teaching team, a \\"c√°tedra\\"). ==Other professorships== * a retired tenured faculty member who demonstrated excellency in both teaching and researching * also a retired faculty member who provides assistance in specific knowledge areas * an honorary mostly ceremonial position Professors holding these positions usually teach upper classes, graduate classes, or do not teach (working as researchers or research advisors). ==Temporary professorships== * * (for a certain period) ==Teaching auxiliaries or assistants== * (In many universities, holding a doctorate is now a non-formal requirement for this post.) * (Graduated) * (Graduated) * (for undergraduate students) ==See also== *List of academic ranks Category:Academic ranks Category:Education in Argentina Ranks ","title":"Academic ranks in Argentina"},{"id":"35190082","text":"There are at least 24 named lakes and reservoirs in Bradley County, Arkansas. ==Lakes== *Bend Lake, , el. *Bilbo Lake, , el. *Black Lake, , el. *Black Lake, , el. *Buck Lake, , el. *Eagle Lake, , el. *Frank Lake, , el. *Gar Lake, , el. *Green Lake, , el. *Middle Lake, , el. *Moro Bay, , el. *Mud Lake, , el. *Pereogeethe Lake, , el. *Pine Prairie Bay, , el. *Raymond Lake, , el. *Scott Water, , el. *Straight Lake, , el. *White Oak Lake, , el. ==Reservoirs== *Atkins Pond, , el. *Bradley County Lake, , el. *Fullerton Lake, , el. *Reeps Lake, , el. *Scott Lake, , el. *Warren Country Club Lake, , el. ==See also== * List of lakes in Arkansas ==Notes== Category:Bodies of water of Bradley County, Arkansas Bradley ","title":"List of lakes of Bradley County, Arkansas"},{"id":"35190111","text":"Kirkstall, located in southwest Victoria, Australia 5 kilometres from Koroit, is in the heart of the traditional lands of the local Aboriginal people; the Gunditjmara.

Both systems have derived from a common heritage in the British university system. ==Overview in Australia== The system of academic titles and ranks in Australia is classified to a common five levels, A-E, although the titles of these levels may differ between institutions. These are: *Level A - Tutor/Associate Lecturer/Research Associate *Level B - Lecturer/Research Fellow *Level C - Senior Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow *Level D - Associate Professor/Reader *Level E - Professor These levels correspond to salary levels set by the Australian government's Higher Education Academic Salaries Award (2002). There has been a significant increase in academics at level D and E (Associate professor and professor) in recent years. The number of academics at these levels increased by 70% from 1996 to 2008. In order to receive the title of professor, the applicant must pass each university's minimum standards statements and promotion policies, which are derived from the Higher Education Academic Salaries award. Three key attributes are examined: recognition, distinction and leadership. Leadership in research is arguably the most important. Some universities also expect leadership in developing the curriculum and in the teaching and management of staff and students. The difference between professor and associate professor is that there is less of an imperative to demonstrate leadership qualities for the title of associate professor. Still, in order to receive the title, it is required that the applicant has made an 'outstanding contribution' and that the applicant is usually recognised at a national or international level. In some universities, the title of professor and associate professor can also be conferred with appointment to a senior management position without the need for an extensive academic record or a research higher degree. Adjunct and conjoint professor are honorary titles bestowed upon a person to formally recognise that person's non-employment 'special relationship' with the university. Emeritus professor is a title bestowed upon a retired person who has rendered distinguished service to the university. They have nearly always held the title of professor at the university. Half the universities in one study specified that the person needed to have served at least 10 years at the university. Some universities have other titles such as Emeritus Educator and Emeritus Scholar. Once the Emeritus Professor title is bestowed, the title is normally for life, though it can be repealed for failing to abide by university regulations. ==Overview in New Zealand== The system of academic titles in New Zealand is classified as follows: *Lecturer/Research Fellow *Senior Lecturer/Senior Research Fellow *Senior Lecturer (over the bar)/Senior Research Fellow (over the bar) *Associate Professor *Professor *Distinguished Professor ==Teaching and research positions== Academic positions in Australia and New Zealand can be either continuing (permanent) or fixed-term (contract) appointments. Continuing appointments at the lecturer level and above are similar to the permanent academic posts found in the United Kingdom, and generally involve a 3-5 year probationary period. Between 2009 and 2015, the University of Western Australia (UWA) used titles more aligned with North American academic titles, but reverted to standard Australian academic titles in 2015. {  - ! Level !! Title !! Salary range (AU) !! Notes -  E  Professor  $175,000 and above Equivalent to distinguished/endowed professor in most Asian and North American universities and to a professor of a discipline in British universities. In Australia and NZ, the number of academics at Level E is approximately 10 percent of the total number of academic staff. This rank is only given to those who have demonstrated outstanding competence and academic leadership in research, teaching, and service as well as achieving international recognition of their scholarship. -  D  Associate Professor  $149,000 - $188,000  Equivalent to professor in most Asian countries and in North American universities. Equivalent to reader in Britain. Academics appointed to Level D are developing a very strong international profile and have demonstrated sustained high competence in both teaching and research. -  C  Senior Lecturer $112,000 - $140,000  Equivalent to associate professor in North American universities (though without any particular implications in terms of tenure). Normally, academic staff demonstrating sustained competence in research and teaching are promoted to this rank after 4 to 6 years of service at the rank of lecturer. Most appointments at this level are 'continuing', the equivalent of North American tenure, although some temporary appointees at Level B on longer contracts may achieve promotion to Level C during their employment. -  B  Lecturer  $92,000 - $118,000  Equivalent to assistant professor in North American universities (though without implication of tenure status ‚Äì appointments at this level can be strictly temporary, or entirely permanent). This is the usual entry level appointment for new full-time academics, be they permanent or on temporary contract. Appointment at Level B typically requires the candidate to possess a PhD. It is possible for a lecturer in Australia and New Zealand to be on a permanent contract and complete their probation while remaining at Level B, thus attaining the equivalent of tenure. -  A  Associate Lecturer  $64,000 - $92,000  Appointments at this level are usually for new academics. Some positions at Level A are occupied by those with extensive industry experience relevant to teaching and research but who do not possess a PhD. Postdoctoral fellowships are also typically awarded at this level. } *Salaries determined by the minimum and maximum salaries within each letter category offered to staff at the University of Queensland, University of Melbourne and University of Western Australia. ==Research only positions== *Professor - senior principal research fellow (level E) *Associate professor - principal research fellow (level D) *Senior research fellow (level C) *Research fellow (level B) *Research associate (level A) The Australian public service or government organisations also employ a large number of academics or researchers. Different organisations have their own established title systems (e.g., principal scientist, senior officer etc.). However, it is the level rather than the title that determines the equivalent academic rank. With Commonwealth Scientific & Industry Research Organisation (CSIRO), levels for Research Scientists and Research Engineers are as follows: *Level 4 (Postdoctoral Fellow), equivalent to academic level A or postdoctoral researcher; *Level 5 (Research Scientist), equivalent to academic level B; *Level 6 (Senior Research Scientist), equivalent to academic level C; *Level 7 (Principal Research Scientist), equivalent to academic level D; *Level 8 (Senior Principal Research Scientist), equivalent to academic level E; *Level 9 (Chief Research Scientist). Most state governments use similar levels, but may use different titles. CSIRO uses the same levels but different titles for other functional roles, including Research Management, Research Projects and Research Consulting. These roles are less directly analogous to academic positions, though Research Management roles at levels 7 and 8 could be equated to Associate Dean and Dean roles at universities. The Western Australian state government introduced a specified calling system in 2008. Within this system, *SC-level 1, equivalent to postdoctoral fellow or associate lecturer; *SC- level 2, equivalent to lecturer or research scientist; *SC-level 3, equivalent to senior lecturer or senior scientist; *SC-level 4, equivalent to associate professor; *SC-level 5, equivalent to professor; *SC-level 6, chief. ==Administrative ranks== *Visitor (titular) *Chancellor (titular) *Deputy chancellor / pro-chancellor (titular) *Vice-chancellor *Provost *Deputy vice- chancellor *Pro-vice-chancellor (could be the faculty dean) *Registrar (education) (there is not necessarily such a position) *Faculty dean (normally professor) *Faculty deputy dean; associate dean (normally professor, associate professor or reader) *Head of school and Head of Department (normally professor, associate professor, or reader) *Program director (normally senior lecturer or above) *Course coordinator (lecturer and above) ==See also== *List of academic ranks == References == Category:Academic ranks Category:Higher education in Australia Category:Higher education in New Zealand Ranks Ranks ","title":"Academic ranks (Australia and New Zealand)"},{"id":"35190274","text":"\\"Pilot\\" is the first episode of the first season of the ABC mystery drama, Missing.

The episode was written by series creator Aaron Korsh and was directed by Kevin Bray. The series revolves around two lawyers who, between the two of them, have only one law degree. Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) is promoted to senior partner of the Pearson Hardman law firm. To his annoyance, company policy requires he hire a Harvard Law School graduate as his associate attorney. Meanwhile, college dropout Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) delivers a suitcase of marijuana for a friend, only to find that the drop is a sting operation. While escaping the police, he mistakenly sits for an interview with Harvey and impresses the attorney with his eidetic memory, encyclopedic knowledge of law, and drive to become a good lawyer. Despite Mike's lack of a law degree, Harvey hires him. On Mike's first day, Harvey must personally handle a pro bono case to keep his promotion. Instead, he has Mike take care of the suit, in which a woman claims her boss sexually harassed her. The series was originally written as a spec script for a half-hour drama set on Wall Street. Korsh later decided to change the premise because, unlike working on Wall Street, working as a lawyer requires several qualifications. The episode was watched by an estimated 4.64 million viewers and saw a double-digit growth over the January premiere of the network's other legal drama Fairly Legal. However, critical reception was mixed. Some reviewers described the premise as absurd and preposterous and criticized the characters, most notably Harvey. Conversely, others lauded the characters' interactions and the snappy dialogue and praised the series' attempt to make the typical USA formula more grounded and edgy. == Plot == At the Pearson Hardman law firm in Manhattan, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) convinces his client Gerald (John Bedford Lloyd) to sign a deal by lying and telling Gerald that Pearson Hardman has already been paid. Meanwhile, Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is nearly caught taking the LSAT for someone else. Shortly after, his marijuana-dealing friend Trevor (Tom Lipinski) offers him a job: Trevor cannot meet a client and needs someone to deliver some drugs. Mike refuses the job. In the morning, managing partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) promotes Harvey to senior partner. To his annoyance, company policy requires he hire a Harvard Law School graduate as his associate attorney. His interviews are already set for tomorrow. Mike learns that he cannot afford to keep his grandmother (Rebecca Schull) in a private nursing home. To make the money, he agrees to make the drop for Trevor tomorrow. As Trevor leaves his drug supplier, he overhears that the drop might be a sting operation. The suppliers find Trevor eavesdropping and force him to stay overnight so that he can't warn Mike of the possible set up. The next day, Harvey finds that none of the interviewees are promising. Mike discovers the set-up and runs into Harvey's interviews to escape the police. He is mistaken for a candidate. When he walks into the interview, the suitcase opens and the marijuana falls out. However, Harvey is impressed with Mike's quick thinking, eidetic memory, and encyclopedic knowledge of law. Mike also displays a drive to become a better lawyer than any Harvard graduate. Despite Mike's lack of a law degree, Harvey hires him. He instructs Mike to stop talking to Trevor and to get rid of the suitcase, which Mike hides in his apartment. On Mike's first day, Harvey is demoted because Gerald discovered Harvey's lie and fired the firm. Jessica threatens to have him disbarred if he steps out of line again. Harvey immediately fires Mike, but rehires him when Mike threatens to tell the truth. Harvey then demands that Jessica return his senior partnership. If she does not, he will tell the ethics board that Jessica did not fulfill her duty to report misconduct. She returns his promotion on the condition that he personally handles a pro bono case. He reluctantly accepts, but he assigns it to Mike instead. In the suit, Nancy (Dagmara Dominczyk) claims her boss Charles Hunt sexually harassed her and then fired her under false pretenses. Eventually, Mike is able to convince former employee Joanna Webster (Kristen Bush) to testify. One night, Mike finds that Trevor ransacked his apartment while looking for the suitcase. Mike takes the suitcase to work the next morning and locks it in his desk. Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), Harvey's rival and the associates' supervisor, has Mike drug tested and reveals that he is suspicious of Mike's Harvard credentials. That afternoon, Joanna's deposition does not go well and she refuses to testify in court. Mike quits his job and tells Harvey that, on his first day, Louis fired Gary Lipski and threatened to fire Mike if he makes a mistake. However, Harvey says quitting has nothing to do with Louis; Harvey knows Mike had the suitcase in his desk and accuses Mike of having \\"one foot out the door.\\" Later, Harvey confronts Louis about Lipski. However, Lipski works in the mailroom and was never fired. With this revelation, Harvey realizes that Joanna never worked for Hunt. He convinces her to confess the truth. Mike gives Trevor the suitcase, but as payback, he exposes Trevor's drug-dealing business to Trevor's girlfriend Jenny (Vanessa Ray). In the morning, Harvey is happy to hear that Mike no longer has the suitcase. At the hearing, Mike and Harvey threaten to charge Hunt with witness tampering unless he agrees to a settlement. As Harvey and Mike leave the courtroom, Harvey presents Mike with his next case. == Production ==  Pre- production  On April 5, 2010, USA announced that it was developing seven new pilots for its 2010-2011 television season, including A Legal Mind, which would later become Suits. The premiere was written by Aaron Korsh, and David Bartis and Gene Klein served as executive producers. It was later announced on May 17, 2010 that USA ordered a ninety-minute cast-contingent pilot for the series. The network later picked up A Legal Mind on January 19, 2011 and ordered eleven one-hour episodes in addition to the 90-minute pilot.  Conception  Creator Aaron Korsh, whose Notes from the Underbelly sitcom was canceled during the 2007-2008 Writers' Strike, wrote a spec script intended to be a \\"half-hour Entourage-type based on my experiences working on Wall Street.\\" He later realized that the project should have hour-long episodes. Korsh and his agent took the script to several production companies and wanted to give the script to Universal Media Studios. However, Korsh found it odd that the studio did not want to sell the script to NBC, the network the studio typically worked with. Korsh's agent convinced USA Network executive Alex Sepiol that although the series was neither a procedural nor what the network typically did, he would like the characters. Sepiol approved of the script, and by then, Hypnotic Films & Television signed on to the project. The team pitched the script to USA, which bought the script after the pitch. Korsh did not pitch it to anyone else. When rewriting the script, Korsh made only small changes to the first half-hour, up to when Mike is hired. Originally, Mike did not take LSATs for others and only pretends to have attended Harvard, as opposed to pretending he attended Harvard and has a law degree. Korsh noted that there is no degree or test needed to work on Wall Street and be a mathematical genius, unlike the bar examination in law. He decided to \\"embrace\\" this difference and change the premise.  Casting  The series stars six cast members. On July 7, 2010, Patrick J. Adams was the first actor to be cast and was given the role of Mike Ross, a college dropout pretending to be a Harvard graduate. Gabriel Macht was cast as corporate lawyer Harvey Specter on July 26, and on August 8, Rick Hoffman joined the series as Harvey's jealous rival Louis Litt. On August 24, Meghan Markle and Gina Torres were cast as paralegal Rachel Lane and senior partner Katherine Pearson, respectively; the characters were later renamed Rachel Zane and Jessica Pearson. Sarah Rafferty rounded off the main cast as Donna Paulsen, Harvey's assistant.  Filming  The episode was filmed in New York City, where the series is set, and is the only episode to be filmed on location. The rest of the series is filmed in Toronto, where the sets are built to be identical to the New York law offices seen in the pilot.  Promotion  To promote the series debut, USA had an advance screening of the pilot on June 2, 2011 at the Hudson River Park and distributed free H√§agen-Dazs Sundaes cones at the viewing. The network also had branded ice cream carts, bikes, and scooters give away the Sundaes and USA/Entertainment Weekly 2011 promotion summer guides on June 22 and June 23 in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston to promote the pilot. == Reception ==  Ratings  \\"Pilot\\" originally aired on USA Network on June 23, 2011 at 10:00 pm after Burn Notice. The series debuted to an estimated 4.64 million viewers and received a 1.6 rating among adults aged 18 to 49. The episode was watched by an estimated 2 million people aged 18 to and 49 and by about 2.1 million people aged 25 to 54, a double-digit growth over the January premiere of network's other legal drama Fairly Legal. The pilot ranked number nine in the top viewed basic cable shows for that week.  Critical reception  Critical reception to the pilot episode was mixed. Ginia Bellafante, writing for The New York Times, stated that the series \\"erupts from a Mount Vesuvius of absurdities\\" and described the plot as preposterous. She pointed out that the episode, like so many other USA series she described as \\"forged seemingly on creative autopilot\\", ignores all the negatives and only portrays the positive in an attempt to \\"appeal to the fantasy of second chances and sexy opportunities.\\" However, she said that the series comes in \\"relatively good faith.\\" She felt that the episode was amusing at its start, but it \\"quickly descends into cloying buddy escapade.\\" Diane Wertis of Newsday gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, but she conceded that viewers must not think \\"too hard\\" about the premise or the fact that the other characters have not figured out Mike is not a lawyer. However, she praises the series' effort to delve deeper than the usual USA series. She also praises the dialogue, stating that the characters are \\"whipping banter around the office like racquetball champs\\", and hopes that the series will go deeper into the characters. The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan felt that the episode moves slowly as the lead characters do not meet until twenty minutes into the episode and the episodes main storyline does not appear until ten minutes after that. He said that the first twenty minutes before Mike and Harvey's first meeting feels like \\"extraneous origin story\\" and even when those plot points are reincorporated into the plot they are \\"tangential and distracting.\\" He described the premise as \\"the-less-you-think-about-it-the-better\\" and agreed that the premise was \\"improbable.\\" However, he felt that once the episode reaches the series' true premise, \\"there's plenty of sparks to go around.\\" He praises the \\"amusing back and forth\\" between Harvey and Mike and likes the inversion of the good guy and bad guy are forced to work together trope. He stated that it is difficult to not be charmed by both the characters and the show. David Hinckley of the Daily News rated the episode 3 of 5 stars and stated that the episode \\"stretch[es] credibility until it screams for mercy\\" and notes that the casework in the episode mostly serves as a means to allow Harvey to declare his lack of personal investment in his clients. He commented that a future relationship between either Mike and Rachel or Mike and Jenny is not difficult to predict. However, Hinckley said that the series is worthwhile if the viewers could get past the premise. He also praises the amount of \\"character fodder\\" and described the dialogue as \\"snappy with a pop-culture flavor.\\" Brian Lowry at Variety stated that the series \\"weaves together elements of White Collar, Fairly Legal and Psych.\\" However, he said that the series' shortcomings stem from \\"the dangers of buying concepts off the rack.\\" He felt that although Mike is humanized by his youth and financial need, Harvey comes across as \\"a swaggering ass\\", a handicap not even the characters' playful banter can overcome. He also stated that the supporting cast are accessories to primary characters that are not colorful and stated that it is difficult to \\"get too excited about a couple of empty suits.\\" Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette compared the series to TNT's Franklin & Bash and said that Suits fares better as it is more realistic and is more grounded in reality. He commented that the series' appeal comes from its \\"snappy banter.\\" He felt that Adams made a \\"winning impression\\" and Mike's character serves as a balance to Harvey's. Robert Bianco of USA Today praises USA's effort to move into a more grounded and edgy version of its formula. However, he criticizes the series as \\"misguided\\" and \\"ludicrous, ill-cast and ill-conceived, with a premise that's idiotic even in a medium used to skimming past idiotic premises.\\" He also commented that the cases were not compelling enough to make him overlook the series' structural flaws and said that there was little in Suits that cannot be found in other legal dramas. He had trouble believing that Harvey would take such a risk or that Mike is even worth the risk. He also lamented the fact that Hoffman was cast as \\"annoying-worm nemesis.\\" The San Francisco Chronicles David Wiegand is unsurprised that USA's new show involved a character pretended something he is not. He describes the concept as \\"nonsensical\\" and impossible. Although he felt that the case had unexpected twists, he felt that it served more as a plot device than a hook. However, he believed that the show's appeal comes from the relationship between Mike and Harvey and praised the way Adams and Macht played off one another, though he doubted that this alone could sustain the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix had a hard time sitting through the episode, which he described as inflated and \\"a bit much.\\" He stated that the premise is thin and felt that the series is an excuse for \\"attractive people dressed in nice outfits to banter.\\" He felt that the pilot would have benefited from a shorter run-time and the series would have benefited from more logic and more interaction between Harvey and Mike. Despite this, he noted that the episode had moments where it came close to \\"clicking\\", such as Harvey and Mike's first meeting and Harvey amusing hypothetical in a deadpan scene. Laurel Brown of BuddyTV felt that the series was \\"too good for summer.\\" Though the premise is familiar, she praised the fact that Mike is not an immediate star and struggles to live up to his smarts. She also praises Harvey for gaining character during his interactions with Donna and Jessica when he was initially entertaining but two-dimensional. She praises the banter and the interactions between all characters and declares that the series is \\"a truly high-quality piece of television.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described the series as \\"light, inoffensive, character-driven, and mostly sunny with a chance of drama.\\" He felt that the series was an \\"especially neutral venture\\" and that it was too bland to either like or dislike it. He described the plot twists as contrived and stated that although Mike and Harvey appear to be opposite, it is obvious that Harvey is a goody guy. He stated that the episode was long, elaborate, and \\"more convoluted than it needs to be.\\" Nancy deWolf Smith, writing for The Wall Street Journal, said that although the premise is preposterous and the series is similar to other USA series, the characters and the show are able to create a near-sense of drama with glimpses of \\"bare souls\\" and stretches without a gag in sight. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote that although the series portrays Harvey and Mike as charismatically mis-matched, he felt that the only difference between them is that \\"one's a total a-hole and one isn't.\\" He stated that Harvey is only the best lawyer because he \\"provide[s] a sort of ethereal con-man/people reading expertise that's a writer's dream.\\" He notes that Harvey does not do anything concrete and only wins his promotion because has a certain je ne sais quoi that Louis does not. He felt that Harvey was too cold and arrogant for the viewers to support. He described the Pearson Hardman firm as full of \\"arrogant pricks and bitter jerks\\". Fowler also laments the fact that Harvey and Mike are too close in age and that Mike would \\"vanish completely\\" if he did not have the semi-romantic scenes with Rachel. In the end, he stated that the episode was not bad but not good and hoped that the series would bring a more interesting dynamic to Harvey and Mike's interactions. == References  External links == * \\"Pilot\\" at USA Network * * Category:Suits (American TV series) Suits Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in New York City ","title":"Pilot (Suits)"},{"id":"35190408","text":"\\"HARD\\" topiary display at Kennedy Park Kennedy Park is a large, multi-use park in Hayward, California, managed by the Hayward Area Recreation and Park District (HARD).

viscera (organs). Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to localize and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, changes in vital signs as well as emotional manifestations. The pain may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.Urch CE & Suzuki R. Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain. In: Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S. Clinical pain management: Cancer pain. 2 ed. London: Hodder Arnold; . p. 3‚Äì12 Distinct structural lesions or biochemical abnormalities explain this type of pain in only a proportion of patients. These diseases are grouped under gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMD). Others can experience occasional visceral pains, often very intense in nature, without any evidence of structural, biochemical or histolopathologic reason for such symptoms. These diseases are grouped under functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and the pathophysiology and treatment can vary greatly from GINMD. The two major single entities among functional disorders of the gut are functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.Gschossmann JM, Holtmann G, Mayer EA. Epidemiology and clinical phenomenology of visceral pain Schmerz. 2002 Dec;16(6):447-51. Visceral hypersensitivity is hypersensitive visceral pain perception, which is commonly experienced by individuals with functional gastrointestinal disorders. ==Epidemiology== In the past viscera were considered insensitive to pain but now it is clear that pain from internal organs is widespread and that its social burden may surpass that of pain from superficial (somatic) sources. Myocardial ischemia, the most frequent cause of cardiac pain, is the most common cause of death in the United States.Silverman DHS. Curr Rev Pain 1999; 3(4):291‚Äì299 Urinary colic produced from ureteral stones has been categorized as one of the most intense forms of pain that a human being can experience. The prevalence of such stones has continuously increased, reaching values of over 20% in developed countries.Vasavada PV, et al. In: Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica's Management of Pain. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2001, pp 1309‚Äì1325 Surveys have shown prevalence rates among adults of 25% for intermittent abdominal pain and 20% for chest pain; 24% of women suffer from pelvic pain at any point in time. For over two-thirds of sufferers, pain is accepted as part of daily life and symptoms are self- managed; a small proportion defer to specialists for help. Visceral pain conditions are associated with diminished quality of life, and exert a huge cost burden through medical expenses and lost productivity in the workplace.Smita L.S. Halder and G. Richard Locke III Epidemiology and social impact of visceral pain Chapter 1 == Clinical presentation == Visceral pain should be suspected when vague midline sensations of malaise are reported by a patient. True visceral pain is characterized as a vague, diffuse, and poorly defined sensation.Procacci P, et al. In: Cervero F, Morrison JFB (Eds). Visceral Sensation, Progress in Brain Research, Vol. 67. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1986, pp 21‚Äì28. Regardless of specific organ of origin, the pain is usually perceived in the midline spanning anywhere from the lower abdomen up to the chest. In the early phases the pain is perceived in the same general area and it has a temporal evolution, making the onset sensation insidious and difficult to identify.Giamberardino MA. Eur J Pain 1999; 3(2):77‚Äì92. The pain is typically associated with involvement of the autonomic nervous system. Some of these symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, vomit, changes in vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate and/or temperature. Strong emotional reactions are also common presenting signs and may include anxiety, anguish and a sense of impending doom. Visceral pathology may also manifest only through emotional reactions and discomfort where no pain is reported. The intensity of visceral pain felt might have no relationship to the extent of internal injury.Cervero F\\" Gut 2000; 47:56‚Äì57 Visceral pain changes in nature as it progresses. Pain from a specific organ can be experienced, or \\"referred\\" to different sites of the body. There is no pathology or no cause for pain at these referred somatic sites however the pain will be experienced at this location, often with significant intensity. Referred pain is sharper, better localized, and less likely to be accompanied by autonomic or emotional signs. A good example of visceral pain that is common place and embodies the wide spectrum of clinical presentations discussed above is a myocardial infarction (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack. This pain is secondary to ischemia of the cardiac tissue. The most common presenting symptom is chest pain that is often described as tightness, pressure or squeezing. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, over several minutes and tends to be located in the central chest (overlying the sternum) although it can be experienced in the left chest, right chest, and even abdominal area. Associated symptoms, which are mostly autonomic in nature, include diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and anxiety (which is often described as a sense of impending doom).Mallinson, T (2010). \\"Myocardial Infarction\\". Focus on First Aid (15): 15. Retrieved 2010-06-08.National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Heart Attack Warning Signs. Retrieved November 22, 2006 Referred pain is experienced most commonly radiating down the left arm however it can also radiate to the lower jaw, neck, back and epigastrium. Some patients, especially elderly and diabetics, may present with what is known as a painless myocardial infarction or a \\"silent heart attack\\". A painless MI can present with all of the associated symptoms of a heart attack, including nausea, vomiting, anxiety, heaviness, or choking, but the classic chest pain described above is lacking. It is always important for not only the physician but also the patient to remember the dissociation between magnitude of injury to internal organs and the intensity of pain and how this can be potentially dangerous if overlooked, for example a silent heart attack.Carr, D.B. (2005). \\"Visceral Pain\\" International Association for the Study of Pain. VXIII, No.6 More rarely intense visceral pain does not signify a significant pathologic process, for example intense gas pains. == Neurobiology == The vague and poorly defined sensation as well as its temporal nature, characteristic of visceral pain, is due to the low density of sensory innervation of viscera and the extensive divergence of visceral input within the central nervous system (CNS). The phenomenon of referred pain is secondary to the convergence of visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers entering the spinal cord at the same level as the superficial, somatic structures experiencing the pain. This leads to a misinterpretation of incoming signals by higher brain centers. == Treatment == There are two goals when treating visceral pain: to alleviate the current experience of pain and to address any underlying pathology, if and when identifiable. Treatment of the pain in many circumstances should be deferred until the origin of the symptoms has been identified. Masking pain may confound the diagnostic process and delay the recognition of life-threatening conditions. Once a treatable condition has been identified there is no reason to withhold symptomatic treatment. Also, if cause for the pain is not found in reasonable time then symptomatic treatment of the pain could be of benefit to the patient in order to prevent long-term sensitization and provide immediate relief.Giamberardino MA. In: Devor M, et al. (Eds). Proceedings of the 9th World Congress on Pain, Progress in Pain Research and Management, Vol. 16. Seattle: IASP Press, 2000, pp 523‚Äì550.Song SO, Carr DB. Pain: Clin Updates 1999; VII:1. Symptomatic treatment of visceral pain relies primarily upon pharmacotherapy. Since visceral pain can result secondary to a wide variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of analgesics (ex. opiates, NSAIDs, benzodiazepines), antispasmodics (ex. loperamide), antidepressants (ex. TCA, SSRI, SNRI) as well as others (ex. ketamine, clonidine, gabapentin). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs.Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica's Management of Pain, 3rd ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001. For example, the use of nitrates can reduce anginal pain by dilating the coronary arteries and thus reducing the ischemia causing the pain. The use of spasmolytics (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut. There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include side effects (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), chemical dependence or addiction, and inadequate pain relief. Invasive therapies are in general reserved for patients in whom pharmacological and other non-invasive therapies are ineffective. A wide variety of interventions are available and shown to be effective, a few will be discussed here. Approximately 50‚Äì80% of pelvic cancer pain patients benefit from nerve blocks.Patt RB. Cancer pain. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott; 1993 Nerve blocks offer temporary relief and typically involve injection of a nerve bundle with either a local anesthetic, a steroid, or both. Permanent nerve block can be produced by destruction of nerve tissue. Strong evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials support the use of neurolytic celiac plexus block to alleviate pain and reduce opioid consumption in patients with malignant pain originating from abdominal viscera such as the pancreas. Eisenberg E, et al. Pain: Clin Updates 2005; XIII:5. Neurostimulation, from a device such as a spinal cord stimulator (SCS), for refractory angina has been shown to be effective in several randomized controlled trials. A SCS may also be used for other chronic pain conditions such as chronic pancreatitis and familial Mediterranean fever. Other devices that have shown benefit in reducing pain include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS), targeted field stimulation, both used for somatic hyperalgesic states, external neuromodulation, pulsed radiofrequency ablation and neuraxial drug delivery systems. == References == Category:Pain Category:Physiology ","title":"Visceral pain"},{"id":"35190687","text":"Call Me No One (sometimes abbreviated as CMNO) was an American hard rock band founded by Sevendust members Clint Lowery and Morgan Rose in 2012. It was later extended with Rek Mohr (Leo/Hurt) on bass and Souls Harbor guitarist/bassist and Shinedown touring guitarist Alan Price on guitar. The band entered the studio on January 22, 2012 to begin recording their debut album Last Parade, which was ultimately released on June 5, 2012 via 7 Bros.

It is the first organization that was established in exile to develop a primary focus on Tibetan social work. The Lha Charitable Trust was founded in 1997 and is registered as a charitable trust by the Himachal Pradesh government of India. Lha is managed by Tibetan refugees, is supported by volunteers and contributors from around the world, and serves refugees, the local Indian population and people from the surrounding Himalayan region. In a short period of time, the organization \\"has grown in leaps and bounds, from a small start- up with two computers to one of largest community based Tibetan NGOs in Dharamsala.\\" Lha is a sacred Tibetan word that means \\"superior body\\" or \\"energy body\\", whereby the \\"Lha body\\" exists between the physical body and the mind. The Trust offers volunteers and students the opportunity to engage in community service and social work on a permanent or temporary basis. On the website of Gaden Relief Projects (an organization that helps to preserve Tibetan culture in India, Mongolia, and Tibet), Lha is recognized as one of the organizations that offers volunteering opportunities. ==Background== Since 1959, Tibetans living in Tibet have been subject to the policies of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China‚Äîunder this regime, the Tibetan people's freedom of expression and political action are extremely limited. Consequently, over the past fifty years, many thousands of Tibetans have chosen to leave their homeland in pursuit of the human rights that have been denied under Chinese rule. Every year, new refugees arrive in India, after an arduous journey through the Himalayas, and countless refugees arrive with little or no education, speak only Tibetan, and possess no viable job skills to support themselves and their families. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult for adult and elderly refugees to receive an adequate education in India due to the strict school system requirements, as educational policy prevents adults over the age of eighteen years from enrolling in school. Under such conditions, Lha plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition of Tibetan refugees from their homeland to the Indian community by providing long-term rehabilitation and educational resources for Tibetan adults. == Mission and objectives == Lha's mission is to be \\"a resource of education and knowledge that provides meaningful, multi-level social and education services for the benefit of others.\\" The organization seeks to generate an atmosphere of harmony and cooperation within the community by tending to the needs of the impoverished and underprivileged. A key focus of Lha is to assist Tibetan refugees to survive and prosper in their new home, while also preserving the unique Tibetan culture. Approximately 60 percent of Lha's graduates work in the local community, 30 percent work abroad and 10 percent return to Tibet. The Trust partners with several local and international organizations, such as the Tibetan Parent's Association, the Tibetan Women's Association and the Leprosy Assistance project‚Äîall of these bodies regularly collaborate with the Trust \\"to better meet the needs of the exiled community.\\" The Trust's Outreach Program provides aid to the wider Indian community in the form of self- sustaining clean water projects, environmental initiatives, and the donation of medicine, books and clothing. The Trust aims to \\"build a social service bridge for the Tibetan refugee community to northern India.\\" Lha's primary objectives include: #Provide social services to Tibetan refugees and the local Himalayan population. #Provide Tibetan refugees with education and health services, as well as the skills and assistance needed to build a new life in exile. #Facilitate mutual learning and cultural exchange experiences between Tibetans, volunteers and other visitors. #Create awareness of the Tibetan refugee situation and preserve the endangered Tibetan culture. == Volunteering == Volunteers at Lha Lha Volunteers with flags Lha is the largest volunteer host and coordination organization in the Tibetan refugee community of Dharamsala, India. Lha volunteers receive the opportunity to share their knowledge and skills with the local Tibetan and Himalayan population, while also gaining hands-on experience working with a nonprofit, community-based social work organization. Till now, over 6,291 volunteers from forty different countries have contributed to Lha's initiatives. During winter, Lha hosts an average of fifteen to twenty-five volunteers per day, and an average of twenty-five to fifty during summer. Lha welcomes both drop-in volunteers and also those volunteers who plan ahead for the receipt of supported services before their arrival, as well as during their stay in Dharamsala. The organization offers a wide array of long- and short-term volunteer opportunities, at no cost, for both individuals and groups. While most volunteers work directly with Lha, select individuals are offered placements in other local NGOs that require assistance. == Partnerships == Lha and Rotary Club Lha works in conjunction with various local and international organizations to build a strong network of affiliates, working towards the improvement of community and social services. International organizations include Louisiana Himalaya Association \\"LHA\\", Omprakash Foundation, Tulane University, Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Loyola University, Centenary College, Lifeworks International, the Tibet Fund, the Tibetan Friendship Group Australia, Rustic Pathways, and the TibetFreunde Swiss, while local partners include the Central Tibet Administration, Dharamshala Rotary Club, and Delek Hospital, as well as many Tibetan NGOs. == Programs == Lha provides a variety of programs for Tibetan refugees and the local Himalayan community, such as language classes, cultural exchange programs, information technology (IT) classes, vocational training, health and environment education, clothes and medicine distribution, and a community kitchen. On a daily basis, Lha serves an average of 250 people, hosts between fifteen and twenty-five volunteers, and provides up to nineteen programs and services.  Language classes  English Class at Lha Language classes have been taking place at Lha since 1999. Currently, 100 to 120 students per month participate in the language classes at Lha. On a daily basis, Lha offers classes in English, French, Chinese, German and Tibetan, all at varying ability levels. In addition to traditional classroom sessions, Lha offers a daily English conversation class, for additional practice, with native English speakers; a tutoring program is also offered as a supplement for each language class. All courses are staffed by volunteer teachers and are open to the public. In 2014 a new Lha English curriculum book was introduced for the Elementary, Beginner and Intermediate level English classes based on the Standard English curriculum of the Common European Framework for Reference (CEFR). 2,678 students attended language classes in 2014, including 796 new enrollments. The majority of students attend classes for two to six months, and approximately 40 percent continue their studies for between one and three (or more) years. To date, over 10,317 students have benefited from our language classes, developing skills to help in obtaining employment and increasing self-confidence. In the future, Lha plans to add more intensive courses and provide students with certificates of completion.  Computer skills classes  Lha's computer training program aims to provide students with viable job skills and consists of two levels of computer training: Beginner and Intermediate. The types of expertise that are taught include typing, internet proficiency, web design, graphic design, and fluency in technology/programs such as email, MS Word, MS Excel, and Adobe Photoshop. Lha Computer Class The computer classes attract from twenty to thirty students each month. As a fee is required to attend these classes, Lha offers select students full scholarships each month‚Äîespecially to those refugees who are associated with other local NGOs, such as the Tibetan Women's Association, the Tibetan Youth Congress, and the Kunphen Center. Since 2003, over 2,000 students have benefited from computer skills classes and workshops.  Vocational training  Photography classes Lha provides vocational training, including professionally taught IT classes, photography courses and massage therapy courses. Lha plans to provide other types of vocational skills in the future, such as chef courses. When a qualified IT teacher is available, Lha offers an IT program focusing on web design and development, graphic design as well as business skills. Basic photography courses taught by professionals, when available, are open to all interested persons. At the course completion, students display their work in the ‚ÄòLha Photography Exhibition.‚Äô Lha also partners with Chung Yuan Christian University to provide a semi-annual IT workshop that is focused on multimedia programs, the internet and word processing. Cooking and baking classes are available to those wishing to pursue careers in the food industry.  Community soup kitchen  Lha Community Soup Kitchen To address the problem of limited access to both clean water and nutritious food in the local community, Lha initiated the Community Soup Kitchen Project in 2009. On 6 July 2011, Lha officially opened its soup kitchen in the Ahimsa House venue‚Äîit was the first soup kitchen in Dharamsala and provides low-cost, nutritious meals, and clean water to Tibetan refugees (those who cannot afford the nominal fee receive the same services at no cost). In order to fund the monthly cost of the soup kitchen, Lha has partnered with the St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States (U.S.). In 2011, the church received pledges that amounted to US$1,200 per month and the subsequent goal was to increase this amount to US$2,000 to completely cover the monthly cost of the soup kitchen. Clean Water Project Starting in 2010, Lha's clean water project continues to provide clean filtered water to Tibetan communities. The purpose of installing these clean water systems is to ensure that people can access free, filtered water, thus helping to keep the community healthy into the future. The filter unit is an RO+UV+ UF and TTS, considered one of the best filtered water systems available in the area. It will provide more than 100 liters of clean and safe drinking water per hour to the students and their teachers and staff members, while the stainless steel tank is capable of storing 500 liters of water. The water is used not only for drinking but also for cooking, thereby improving the quality of food served at the schools. Additionally, a water cooler providing instant hot and cold filtered water was installed with funds provided directly by Lha. We expect these improvements will help alleviate some of the water-borne illnesses children commonly suffer from in this region, especially during the monsoon season, and that it will contribute to maintaining a high level of general health among students.

Clothing distribution  Clothing Distribution With Lha Lha annually collects thousands of articles of clothing, shoes, and other items at its office on Temple Road‚Äîthe majority of the collected items are donated by volunteers and visiting tourists. Lha has partnered with the local Rotary Club to facilitate clothing distribution campaigns and, each month, Lha donates 100 to 200 items of clothing to the Rotary Club. The Rotary Club helps with the distribution of clothing to the people who reside in the slums of lower Dharamsala. From Ahimsa House, Lha also coordinates additional campaigns throughout the year that assist the people living in McLeod Ganj. Since inception, this project has distributed over 25,000 articles of clothing to both the local Indian community and the Tibetan refugee community. == Cultural Programs == Lha offers the following programs for students, volunteers, and other visitors: Cultural exchange, cultural immersion, and Tibetan homestay. The duration of the cultural exchange and cultural immersion programs are typically one to two weeks, while the Tibetan homestay program requires a one-month commitment. Lha works with student groups from the Tulane University School of Social Work, Centenary College, Loyola University New Orleans, Rustic Path Way, Lifeworks International and other U.S. universities and high schools. In 2011, Lha organized exchange programs for nine student groups from the U.S. and France.  Cultural Exchange  In 2002, Lha was asked by Tulane University‚Äôs School of Social Work to assist a group of graduate social work students on an international social work expedition to Dharamsala . Students were engaged in social work projects within the Tibetan refugee and the local Indian communities and our cultural exchange program was born. Lha has been welcoming growing numbers of visiting University and High school groups each year, a total of 1,229 students to date . Each visiting student is paired with a ‚ÄòMutual Learning Partner‚Äô ‚Äì a Tibetan student at Lha. The students are able to share stories about their lives and experiences, while engaging in social work and other meaningful activities. Students also visit the homes of their partner, meet other members of their family and make friends in the Tibetan refugee community. Lha can arrange lectures from well-known professionals in the evenings on particular topics like the political situation of Tibet, social status of Tibetans in Tibet and of Tibetans in exile, Tibetan medicine, and Tibetan Buddhism and culture.  Tibetan Homestay  For interested students and volunteers, Lha organizes a month-long homestay program with the participation of a Tibetan refugee family. The program is designed to provide unique insight into the rituals, traditions, and general family life of Tibetan refugees in Dharamsala and McLeod Ganj. The profits from the homestay program are received by the host families and help support their lives in exile. Lha's organized homestays of one month are with Tibetan refugee families and include accommodation, breakfast and dinner.  Community Library  Lha has a community library located in McLeod Ganj. Lha's library is the only collection of books available to the community in these locations.

In March 2012, one of the greatest heat waves was observed in many regions of North America. Very warm air pushed northward west of the Great Lakes region, and subsequently spread eastward. The intense poleward air mass movement was propelled by an unusually intense low level southerly jet that stretched from Louisiana to western Wisconsin. Once this warm surge inundated the area, a remarkably prolonged period of record setting temperatures ensued.Meteorological March Madness 2012, Earth System Research Laboratory, 02 April 2012 NOAA's National Climate Data Center reported that over 7,000 daily record high temperatures were tied or broken from 1 March through 27 March. In some places the temperature exceeded . For instance, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the highest temperature recorded was on March 21; in Chicago a high of 87 ¬∞F was also recorded on that same day. Records were broken in unusual ways. Chicago, for example, saw temperatures above every day between March 14‚Äì18, breaking records on all five days. Chicago would go on to record eight days at or above 80 ¬∞F during the month, with many suburban areas recording an additional day in the 80s on March 19 (that day, the city only tied its record high of ). In context, the National Weather Service's Chicago branch noted that Chicago typically averages only one day in the 80's in April. And only once in 140 years of weather observations has April produced as many 80 ¬∞F days as this March. In Traverse City, Michigan one day began with a low temperature (67 ¬∞F) that was higher than the previous record high for the day. Temperature records across much of southern Canada also were shattered. Some of the most impressive readings came from Nova Scotia on March 22, when the mercury climbed to at a climate station in Lake Major, making it the highest March temperature recorded in Nova Scotia, and the third highest March temperature recorded in Canada. That same day, the temperature hit at Western Head, Nova Scotia. The heat reached as far east as Cape Breton Island, with the temperature climbing to at Sydney, Nova Scotia on March 22, a place historically surrounded by ice- jammed waters, frigid winds, and snow in March.

In addition, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data show that the atmospheric pattern was so persistent that much of the Midwest and Northeast, and up into Ontario, had temperature departures over periods of several days to a week or more of magnitudes which would be unusual even for a single day. Averaged over the seven-day period from March 16 to March 22 inclusive, nearly the entire area of the Midwest and Northeast U.S. and most of Ontario and Quebec had temperatures or more above the 1981-2010 average. Even more dramatically, most of Iowa and Minnesota, all of Wisconsin and Michigan, and most of southeastern Ontario had seven-day mean temperatures more than above the climatological average for the same period.Kalnay, E. and Coauthors, 1996: The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 40-year Project.

A contributing factor to the unprecedented warmth was a warmer than average winter with below-average snowfall across the CONUS, meaning less thermal energy was required to heat the atmosphere. It is no coincidence that this heat wave occurred immediately following \\"the biggest dose of heat we've received from a solar storm since 2005\\"https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at- nasa/2012/22mar_saber/?fbclid=IwAR34u_W8r5_XyBEEZkRDo9_PGatR0zaDAa5eO7ZjxyFl98gKjt1_LSkx6x8https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/saber- solarstorm.html?fbclid=IwAR17_RP7C-MDUDgsKHlqL_UOFaVSEfVAZ- sxsPknqYq1XunMpcsQb9gblMw This came from a \\"flurry of eruptions on the sun...March 8th through 10th, the thermosphere absorbed 26 billion kWh of energy\\" Ironically, the scientist of the study speculated that CO, one of \\"the two most efficient coolants[not climate warmers] in the thermosphere, reradiated 95% of that total back into space\\" This phenomena repeated itself in the summer of 2012 with a series of M and X class flares resulting in another heat wave. The primaryunsupported, immediate cause of the heat wave was a buckled jet stream caused by an abnormally strong high pressure ridge atop the Eastern United States and an unusually strong and slow-moving low pressure trough across the West, which brought with it below-average temperatures and snow. The tight pressure gradient allowed for an intense southerly jet to form, which transported warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico northward, with the moisture having an insulating effect during the night. The ridge also deflected storm systems northward away from the Eastern U.S. and kept skies clear, allowing further daytime radiative heating to occur. In addition, the North Atlantic oscillation was in a strongly positive phase during the heat wave, which often foreshadows above average temperatures in the Eastern U.S. The Madden-Julian oscillation also entered a phase correlated with warm temperatures in the U.S. East. == Continued warmth == On June 25, Denver, Colorado tied its all-time high with a temperature of .

Tolan sustained serious injuries in the shooting and charges were pressed against Cotton. On May 11, 2010, a jury reached a verdict of not guilty and Cotton was acquitted. Minority leaders and critics around the country cite the case as an example of racial profiling and institutional racism. A federal civil lawsuit was also filed by the Tolan family. The suit was later settled for $110,000. ==Background== Robert Tolan (born July 15, 1985) is the son of Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan of the St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds. He himself played professional baseball for the Washington Nationals organization. Since the shooting incident, he has not played in professional baseball, he last played for the Bay Area Toros.Texas Police Officer shoots Bobby Tolan's son Robbie was shot while Sgt. Cotton was carrying out an investigation suspecting Tolan to be the driver of a stolen vehicle. However, Tolan was the registered owner of the vehicle.The Son of Famed Baseball Player Shot by Cop in Own Driveway CNN.com, January 8, 2009 ==Shooting incident== Around 2:00 a.m. December 31, 2008, Robbie Tolan and his cousin were confronted in their driveway in the predominantly white city of Bellaire, Texas, by police officers who suspected that the young men were driving a stolen vehicle. According to relatives, the two young men were returning from a late night run to Jack in the Box. Tolan's cousin, Anthony Cooper, reported that the police officers emerged from the darkness pointing a flashlight and gun at them. The officer reportedly commanded them to stop before announcing his status as a police officer. After the officer ordered them to get on the ground, Tolan's parents, Marian and Robert Tolan, came outside to attend to the unidentified noise. At this point, Officer Cotton arrived on the scene as backup to the original officer. Robbie Tolan and other family members report that the altercation between Robbie Tolan and Officer Cotton ensued while Robbie Tolan was laying on the porch facing away from his mother and Officer Cotton. After Cotton pushed Tolan's mother up against the garage door, according to the Police statement, Robbie got up from the ground and turned around toward the policeman. Tolan and his mother state that Robbie did not stand, but pushed up from laying on the ground to all fours while turning around. Cotton turned and fired a shot into Robbie Tolan's chest, sending the bullet through his lung and lodging it into his liver, where it settled and threatened his life. Officer Cotton defended himself stating that he thought Tolan was reaching for a weapon and reacted quickly in what he thought was self-defense. Evidence of how the bullet entered through his chest and traveled through his body to lodge in his liver suggest that Tolan was on all fours or he was bent over when he was shot. Afterward Cotton searched Tolan, who was on the ground, and found no weapon on his person. The police department called the shooting tragic and put Officer Cotton on administrative leave, while rejecting that any allegation of racial profiling would be entertained by the police department. ==Criminal trial and acquittal== The Harris County district attorney's office pressed charges against Officer Jeffery Cotton for aggravated assault by a public servant in the matter of the shooting of Robbie Tolan, claiming that he neglected the basic safety procedures before shooting Tolan. The case involved discussion of racial profiling and racial bias on the part of Cotton; Cotton is white and Tolan is black. The jury featured seven white women, three white men and two black women. Cotton was freed on $20,000 dollar bond while the case was pending. On May 11, 2010, a jury reached a verdict of not guilty and Cotton was acquitted. Minority leaders and critics around the country continue to cite the case as an example of racial profiling and institutional racism. Moreover, the jury declined to convict Officer Cotton on a variety of lesser included offenses ranging from Assault to Deadly Conduct to Reckless Endangerment. After the acquittal of Officer Cotton, African American leaders and activists protested outside the police department for what they perceived to be a classic case of racial bias and injustice. ==Civil trial== Pursuant to the allegations of racial bias, profiling, and discrimination, a civil suit was filed against Jeffery Cotton and the City of Bellaire. The federal civil case was initially dismissed by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon of the District Court for the Southern District of Texas based on qualified immunity, then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where a three-judge panel upheld the dismissal from the District Court based on qualified immunity. The case was appealed to the full Fifth Circuit Court en banc who also upheld the dismissal based on qualified immunity. After a final appeal to the SCOTUS, the case was returned to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for further review. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals revised its original decision slightly, vacating a small portion of the District Court's decision, and remanded the case back to the District Court for further review. The District Court set a trial date for September 2015. A few days before the trial was scheduled to begin, the federal judge removed the City of Bellaire as a defendant in the lawsuit, which prompted the Tolan family to file a motion for the judge to recuse herself. According to Robbie's mother, on Monday, September 14, 2015, the judge dismissed all of the plaintiff's expert witnesses, but none of the defense's expert witnesses. Robbie Tolan had been under a great deal of emotional distress during the seven-year court proceeding and told his family he did not want to continue the process. While Tolan's mother wanted to continue to fight in this case, the family decided to request a settlement with the City in lieu of a trial. According to local news reports, a settlement was reached with the City of Bellaire for $110,000. ==References== Category:Police brutality in the United States Category:Law enforcement in Texas Category:Crimes in Texas Category:2008 in Texas Category:December 2008 crimes Category:December 2008 events in the United States Category:Bellaire, Texas ","title":"Robbie Tolan shooting incident"},{"id":"35191038","text":"Jazz - musical style that originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States, mixing African music and European classical music traditions. Jazz is a music genre that originated from African American communities of New Orleans in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation.Hennessey, Thomas, From Jazz to Swing: Black Jazz Musicians and Their Music, 1917-1935. Ph.D. dissertation, Northwestern University, 1973, pp. 470-473. Jazz spans a period of over a hundred years, encompassing a very wide range of music, making it difficult to define. Jazz makes heavy use of improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation and the swing note,Alyn Shipton, A New History of Jazz, 2nd edn., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4‚Äì5. as well as aspects of European harmony, American popular music,Bill Kirchner, The Oxford Companion to Jazz, Oxford University Press, 2005, Chapter Two. the brass band tradition, and African musical elements such as blue notes and African-American styles such as ragtime. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".Starr, Larry, and Christopher Waterman. \\"Popular Jazz and Swing: America's Original Art Form.\\" IIP Digital. Oxford University Press, 26 July 2008. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass- band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music towards a more challenging \\"musician's music\\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed in the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines. The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz. == What type of thing is jazz? == Jazz can be described as all of the following: * Music - art and cultural form whose medium is sound and silence. Its common elements are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The word derives from Greek ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (mousike; \\"art of the Muses\\"). ** Music genre - conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.  Musical instruments typically associated with jazz  == Jazz genres ==  Jazz fusion  Jazz fusion  Regional scenes   Local scenes  * Cape jazz * Kansas City jazz * Dixieland * West Coast jazz == Jazz compositions ==  Jazz standards  * Jazz standard - musical composition which is an important part of the musical repertoire of jazz musicians, in that it is widely known, performed, and recorded by jazz musicians, and widely known by listeners. Jazz standards include jazz arrangements of popular Broadway songs, blues songs and well-known jazz tunes. ** List of pre-1920 jazz standards ** List of 1920s jazz standards ** List of 1930s jazz standards ** List of 1940s jazz standards ** List of post-1950 jazz standards  Jazz discographies  == History of jazz == * Timeline of jazz education  Stylistic origins  * Blues * Folk * March * Ragtime  Cultural origins  * Early 1910s New Orleans  Mainstream popularity * 1920s-1960s, although popularity and development as a genre persists into the present.

Muthiah has written elsewhere that Mali did as much with his strokes for Vikatan as its celebrated editor Kalki Krishnamurthy did with his words. Mali published his drawings in the Indian Express in the 1930s, and first made his name at the Free Press Journal 'before being immortalised in the pages of Ananda Vikatan, the first popular Tamil periodical'. He also did cartoons for the Vikatan group's English-language Merry Magazine, where he became the editor in 1935. He is said to have left the editorial nitty-gritty to his assistant editor, while continuing to illustrate such humorous serials as 'Private Joyful in Madras' (The magazine shut down in c. 1935 or 1936). While it was the writer and poet Subramanya Bharathi who first introduced cartoons to Tamil journalism, it was Ananda Vikatan that made them truly popular. As cartoonist and senior artist at Ananda Vikatan, Mali was thus a key influence on a second generation of cartoonists. Gopulu and Silpi were illustrators he mentored at Vikatan.

On March 20, 2014, in a game against the Houston Rockets, Dieng recorded 22 points and 21 rebounds, the first ever 20-20 game by a rookie in Timberwolves' franchise history. He also became just the sixth player since the NBA began tracking starts in 1970 to have at least 20 points and 20 rebounds within their first three career starts. On April 11, also against the Rockets, Dieng scored the game-winning basket with 4.6 seconds left and finished with 12 points and 20 rebounds. As a result of his improvements throughout the second half of the season, Dieng was named to the NBA All-Rookie second team.

He has a PhD in Art History, and his publications in the field of charnel house and ossuary research have made him a well-known figure in the field of macabre art and art history. He is a member of The Order of the Good Death. ==Research and publications on human remains in religious art== In 2006, he started extensively studying the use of human remains in religious ritual and as a decorative element in sacred spaces. He began writing about and photographing them for European newspapers, and became an important contributor to magazines which specialize in the paranormal, such as the Fortean Times, covering unusual and spiritual phenomenon surrounding sacred remains throughout the world. In the process, he also compiled material for the first ever history of bone-decorated religious structures, visiting over 70 sites on four continents, some of which had never before been photographed or open to the public. ==The Empire of Death== In 2011, his ossuary research and photos were published by Thames and Hudson as The Empire of Death, the title taken from a caption at the Catacombs of Paris, one of the sites included in the book. The book included other famous ossuaries, such as the Sedlec Ossuary and the crypt of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini, where he had been granted special permission by the monastery and Italian cultural authorities to photograph. A host of similar, previously unknown sites were also included in the book, however, and the text created a context for understanding the construction of these types of elaborate ossuaries as a Catholic phenomenon that was initiated during the Counter-Reformation. The book received extensive media coverage, and was lauded in publications internationally and was named among the best books of the year by the London Evening Standard and awarded Coup de Coeur by the Association of Paris Librarians. ==Heavenly Bodies== His book Heavenly Bodies was released in 2013, and delved even deeper into study of obscure macabre art history by presenting the forgotten story of a group of skeletons taken from the Roman Catacombs in the seventeenth century and completely decorated with jewels by teams of nuns. The book described how these bodies, known as catacomb saints, were identified as Early Christian martyrs, then sent primarily to German-speaking lands where they were decorated and placed into Catholic Churches. Such skeletons were mostly removed and destroyed during the Enlightenment, but Koudounaris tracked down all the surviving examples and photographed them for the book. The book received a tremendous amount of press, and Koudounaris was dubbed \\"Indiana Bones\\" by the UK press, in reference to his curious and macabre discoveries, and the book was named by Dazed and Confused as one of the ten best art and photography books of the year. ==Memento Mori== The third book by Koudounaris on macabre visual culture involving human remains was released in 2015 and titled Memento Mori. In interviews for the book he indicated that it was intended to present a much more global perspective than the previous books by including lengthy sections involving material from Africa, Asia, and South America‚Äîespecially from the country of Bolivia, where he had been studying skull rituals (involving an annual festival to skulls called Natitas in La Paz) for the last ten years. He said that unlike the previous books, this one was primarily a photographic rather than historical and anthropological study, and that he intended it to be his final work on sacred human remains. The book garnered honors as one of American Photo magazine's ten best new photography books. ==Research on sex ghosts and demonic cats== During the research for The Empire of Death, he acquired huge amounts of corollary folklore relating to different macabre subjects. One of these was otherworldly erotic encounters between the living and dead. He refers to the phenomenon as Sex Ghosts, but indicates the history of this type of encounter can be dated all the way to the ancient world. While it is now attributed to ghosts, he says it has previously been attributed to any number of sources. He has given public discussion of the topic internationally, and has done several interviews touching on the subject. He also began to research folklore about demonically- possessed cats, and has done interviews and lectures about this topic around the USA. ==References== Category:American photographers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Paul Koudounaris"},{"id":"35191193","text":"The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan is a 2010 documentary film produced by Clover Films and directed by Afghan journalist Najibullah Quraishi about the practice of bacha bazi in Afghanistan.

It is about a South Korean crown prince who falls in love with a North Korean special agent. The series aired on MBC from March 21 to May 24, 2012 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. ==Synopsis== Set in an alternate reality, modern-day South Korea is governed by a constitutional monarchy descended from the Joseon Dynasty. Lee Jae-ha (Lee Seung-gi) is a handsome yet materialistic crown prince who doesn't care about politics and feels total reluctance to being the second in line to the throne. Lee Jae-kang (Lee Sung-min), the current king, tricks him into joining a joint military collaboration with North Korea as a means to help \\"make him grow up.\\" Meanwhile, Kim Hang-ah (Ha Ji-won) is a North Korean Special Forces officer who is also the daughter of a high ranking North Korean military official. Both Jae-ha and Hang-ah meet at the joint military training, a crucial part in establishing friendly relations between the two separate countries. Although the two are initially antagonistic towards each other, Jae-ha unwittingly sparks a friendship with Hang-ah and he subsequently falls in love with her. Soon, an arranged marriage is set up between the two and they eventually become engaged. While they attempt to set their differences aside and build a growing relationship, things suddenly take a turn for the worse when King Jae-kang and his wife are assassinated by the devious and notorious terrorist group, Club M, led by John Mayer/Kim Bong-gu (Yoon Je-moon), a mysterious magician who is obsessed with eliminating the royal family and plans to rule in their stead. Now crowned the new King of South Korea, Jae-ha must learn to be responsible and protect the country before it is too late. ==Cast== Main characters * Ha Ji-won as Captain Kim Hang-ah The female protagonist - A North Korean Special Forces officer and instructor known in the military to be an \\"Iron Lady\\" with absolutely no femininity within her. She is the only daughter of the Deputy Minister of the North Korean Ministry of Unification. Although tough and fearsome on the surface, at heart she is a shy maiden who struggles to find her companion for life. After a few incidents involving her and the South Korean prince (\\"the archenemy of the socialist state and the people\\"), Jae-ha falls in love with her during the training mission. After Prince Jae-ha confesses his feelings for her on TV, Hang-ah goes to the South to punish him for playing with her feelings. * Lee Seung-gi as Prince Lee Jae-ha (later King Jae-ha) ** Kang Han- byeol as young Jae-ha The male protagonist - The Crown Prince of South Korea with an assumed IQ of 187. An arrogant and irresponsible individual who surprisingly displays a lot of charisma. Unknown to many, Jae-ha's arrogance and behavior was a front so that he could avoid having to meet and befriend people - he had difficulty finding \\"real friends\\" in school once his royal status became known. When his brother, King Jae-kang, ascended to the throne, he assumed that he could live an indulgent \\"playboy\\" lifestyle for the rest of his life. As his two years of conscripted service comes to a close, he is tricked by his brother into participating in a joint military exercise between North and South Korea, organized by the King and the North Korean Military Command. King Jae-kang also used this as an opportunity to teach his brother a lesson and \\"help him grow up\\". However, his personality does not sit well with his teammates, who eventually see him as a royal pain. As a means to whip him into shape, North Korean Representative and Captain Kim Hang-ah \\"threatens\\" him into submission right after their first encounter. * Jo Jung-suk as Eun Shi-kyung The son of the king's chief adviser Eun Kyu-tae, he is a South Korean military officer who participates in the joint collaboration.

He also has an even darker agenda waiting to be revealed. * Lee Yoon-ji as Princess Lee Jae-shin The Princess of South Korea. Prince Jae-ha and King Jae-kang's younger sister. A royal by day and an underground rock band singer by night.

However, she is paralyzed after her brother Jae-kang's death and her kidnapping. Supporting characters * Lee Sung-min as Lee Jae-kang (the King) ** Park Gun-tae as young Jae-kang Jae- ha's and Jae-shin's oldest brother is the King of South Korea, a caring and responsible man to both the Royal Family and the rest of the country.

He also sent Jae-ha into the team to be trained with the hope of transforming him into one who can be sufficiently responsible as a member of the Royal Family.

He is concerned about the fact that his daughter is having a hard time trying to get married. When Hang-ah becomes the target of public suspicion for King Jae-kang's death, he quickly revealed the North Korean investigation result to King Jae-ha.

It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and written by Sam Means. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 22, 2012. In the episode, Jack (Alec Baldwin) decides to create a TV-movie about Avery to keep her in the media spotlight. Liz (Tina Fey) agrees to write the script, and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) campaigns to star in it. Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) objects to new page Hazel's (Kristen Schaal) permissiveness with Tracy (Tracy Morgan), prompting Hazel to choose Liz as a mentor. ==Plot== Jack (Alec Baldwin) goes on The Today Show to keep his wife's plight in the public eye. When his appearance is bumped for breaking news, Jenna (Jane Krakowski) suggests filming a TV movie about the kidnapping. Jack agrees and begins to cast it, angering Jenna. He recruits Liz (Tina Fey) to write the script, and finally agrees that Jenna can capture Avery's \\"essence\\" when she ruthlessly pursues the role with no regard for Jack's feelings. Meanwhile, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) is appalled that new page Hazel (Kristen Schaal) allows Tracy to do many things damaging to this health and his behavior, but Hazel refuses him access to the actor. Hazel seeks out Liz's advice and asks to be her mentee. Liz sees the problem through a feminist lens and tells Hazel to stand up to Kenneth. She also tells Hazel to dump her boyfriend, advice that she ignores. Jack coaches Liz on mentoring, telling her that one has to let the mentee fail occasionally. Kenneth quits his job so that he can win the contest for a non-speaking role on TGS, a contest for which Liz had procrastinated picking a winner. Liz selects him as a safe pick, but he uses the opportunity to confess his devotion to Tracy and give him the medicine he needs. The show is ruined, but Hazel shows up to admit that Liz's advice was right; she, Liz, and Jack (as the \\"Grandmentor\\") share a group hug. ==Reception== This episode attracted 3.31 million viewers. Andy Greenwald of Grantland thought the episode was \\"a riotous Roman orgy of hilarity\\" that eventually became exhausting: \\"A nonstop barrage of jokes, even amazing jokes, can eventually feel like being sat on by Hazel two years ago.\\" David Sims of The Onion A.V. Club grew weary of the Hazel storyline, thinking that she might have made the show more relatable, but has become as insane as all the other characters. He speculated that Kenneth would eventually end up as a page again. \\"I‚Äôd be more disappointed if the show had been doing good work with Kenneth as a junior executive, but really, the excuses to shoehorn him into plots were getting more and more tiresome, so it‚Äôs probably best to just have him back as a page.\\" He gave this episode and \\"Kidnapped by Danger\\" a combined grade of B-. ==References External links == * * Category:30 Rock (season 6) episodes Category:Television programs directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller ","title":"Grandmentor"},{"id":"35191643","text":"\\"Kidnapped by Danger\\" is the fourteenth episode of the sixth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock, and the 116th overall episode of the series. It was directed by Claire Cowperthwaite, and written by series creator and star Tina Fey. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 22, 2012, immediately after the previous episode, \\"Grandmentor\\". In the episode, Jack (Alec Baldwin) and writer Liz (Tina Fey) have creative differences over the Avery Jessup TV movie project; Avery's mother (Mary Steenburgen) returns to oversee production, rekindling her chemistry with Jack; Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) copes with his new job as an NBC janitor; and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) reacts poorly to a \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic parody of her new single. Now topical, Jenna (Jane Krakowski) claims to have turned down having sex on three occasions (out of 5) with Harvey Weinstein in this episode. ==Plot== Avery's mother Diana (Mary Steenburgen) arrives to make sure that the TV movie about her daughter shows her in a good light. Liz (Tina Fey) promises to help Jack (Alec Baldwin) overcome his chemistry with Diana and keep him out of an inappropriate relationship. Liz eventually fixes Diana up with the actor playing Jack (William Baldwin, Alec Baldwin's real life brother) to keep her away from Jack. At the table reading of Liz's script, Jack is appalled that Liz has included some seedy details about Jack and Avery's courtship. He fires Liz from the project and rewrites the script himself. Jack eventually realizes that Liz is right that he had been idealizing his relationship with Avery. Liz consoles him and helps him rewrite the script to be a total fabrication. Kenneth, having quit the job he had in \\"Standards and Practices\\", tries to find a new job at NBC. He eventually finds a position as a janitor, in many ways lower than where he started as a page. He admits to Jack that he makes it through each day by lying to himself. Jenna's new single to promote the movie is immediately parodied by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Furious, she and Tracy try to write a new song that cannot be parodied. They eventually come up with a song as silly as a typical Weird Al offering and she debuts it on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Weird Al counters by creating an entirely serious song set to the same tune. ==Reception== The show attracted 3.42 million viewers in its time slot.

He has been part of the Danish bands Delta Cross Band, Cross-Schack-Ostermann and Everybody's Talking. ==Career== Billy Cross graduated from Columbia College, the undergraduate liberal arts college of Columbia University in 1968.

He expects affluence rather than poverty to become the rule by the end of this period given that it would not require unusually high growth rates, and resource and environmental constraints will be overcome by advances in technology. With a high level of economic development, equality would no longer entail sharing poverty and lengthy toil, the main reason for classes and inequality in the past. These views are expounded in his book Bright Future: Abundance and Progress in the 21st Century. == Global affluence == McMullen expects that most regions will undergo considerable economic growth while more and more countries, and an increasing proportion of the world's population, will join the developed camp. He believes that the energy and mineral resources that can be harnessed with present and future technologies will more than meet our needs indefinitely. These include a sixfold increase in energy output by the end of the century to bring 9 to 10 billion people up to present developed world levels of consumption. Furthermore, we will produce all the food we need through the better harnessing of land and water and improved plant and animal breeding. He also believes that our impact on the environment can be kept within manageable limits, with economic development and better technology being the only solution to air and water pollution and threats to flora and fauna. == Improving basis for a post-capitalist society == McMullen contrasts the 21st century prospects for post-capitalist society with the virtually impossible conditions in backward regions such as Russia and China during their 20th century revolutions. The more developed countries are already entering the realm of the possible as average incomes approach a level that provides considerable material comfort and most work takes on a more congenial nature. Work tasks as a whole are becoming more interesting and challenging and the more routine ones are losing their worst aspects. These better material conditions plus the changed social environment to be expected from the new system would make work motivation without material reward quite plausible. In McMullen's view, the non-material underpinnings for a post-capitalist society are also advancing. Culture and education are less and less the private domain of an elite and people are generally less submissive. So he is basically saying that irrespective of other difficulties, there are some very important underlying developments that improve the prospects of a future post-capitalist transformation. == Decentralized price system under social ownership == McMullen also defends the social form of ownership required by a classless post-capitalist society from claims that it would be unable to effectively use a price system based on decentralized bids and offers. This argument is mainly associated with Austrian School economists who argue that such a system requires market exchanges between enterprises. (See Socialist Calculation Debate and Economic Calculation Problem). McMullen believes workers in enterprises and work units, motivated by work satisfaction and the desire to contribute to an efficient and dynamic economy, would drive a better price system than one based on the profit motive. They would bid for resources on the basis of least cost alternatives and an honest expectation of demand for the resulting output. They would offer output at prices that reflect cost and ensure that products go to the highest bidders in the case of excess demand. All demand for intermediate production would be derived from the expected demand for final individual and collective consumption. Such pricing would guide both the more day-to-day decisions and longer term investment. Many of the decisions being made would be quite entrepreneurial in nature involving new products and services, new methods, and new entrants, be they existing enterprises or start-ups. Access to funding for investment could be through numerous assessment agencies that have been allocated funds for that purpose. McMullen stresses that the use of a decentralized price system would not involve so-called \\"market socialism\\". Under social ownership, the transactions between enterprises would not be market exchanges. They would be the transfer of custody of social property not of ownership. An enterprise would not be the owner of inputs and outputs, it would be their custodian. And no individual involved with an enterprise would receive any net revenue nor incur any loss from transactions between enterprises. He also argues that the cooperative environment would lead to a better price system because of the greater honesty, the better flow of information due to the removal of property barriers between enterprises and the fact that income equality would remove the equity concerns currently associated with reliance on pricing. ==See also== *List of socialist economists *Socialization (economics) ==External links== * The Economic Case for Social Ownership * Bright Future: Abundance and Progress in the 21st Century * Re-Opening the Debates on Economic Calculation and Motivation under Socialism Category:Australian economists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"David McMullen"},{"id":"35191695","text":"SHFL entertainment, Inc. (previously named Shuffle Master) was a manufacturer of shuffling machines, table games, slot machines, and other casino products, based in Paradise, Nevada. Founded in 1983, it was acquired by Bally Technologies in 2013. The company designed Deck Mate, one of the primary card shuffling devices used in casinos. The company's table game products included Let It Ride, Three Card Poker, Blackjack Switch, and Casino War. ==History== Shuffle Master was formed by John Breeding, a former truck driver, in 1983. Inspired by a newspaper article about card counting in blackjack, he borrowed $30,000 to develop a mechanical shuffler that would allow every hand to be dealt from a fresh deck, nullifying the advantage of card counting, without losing valuable playing time. The device finally came to market in early 1992, and the company made its initial public offering later that year. Casinos were increasingly using multiple decks for blackjack, limiting the sales potential of Breeding's single-deck shuffler. To fuel demand for the shufflers, he developed a new single-deck game, Let It Ride. By 1995, Let It Ride was generating more revenue for Shuffle Master than its namesake device. In 1998, the company's headquarters moved from Minneapolis to the Las Vegas area. The firm expanded into the slot machine business in the late 1990s, developing games based on licensed properties like The Honeymooners, Press Your Luck and Let's Make a Deal and partnering with larger companies like IGT and Bally to manufacture and distribute them. The slots business failed to turn a profit, and Shuffle Master sold it to IGT in 2004 for $1.6 million. In February 2004, Shuffle Master bought most of the assets of BET Technology, a developer of table games including Casino War and Fortune Pai Gow. In 2006, the company returned to the slot machine field, buying Australian manufacturer Stargames Limited for $108 million. Among Stargames's products was Rapid Roulette, a roulette variant in which a dealer spins a physical roulette wheel, but wagers are placed and paid out on touchscreen terminals, increasing the pace of play. Gavin Isaacs, a former Bally Technologies executive, was named CEO in March 2011. In March 2012, Shuffle Master agreed to buy Ongame Network, a provider of services to online poker sites, from bwin.party Services for $26 to 39 million, but it pulled out of the deal months later due to declining market conditions in Europe and uncertainty about the legalization of online poker in the US. In October 2012, the company changed its name to SHFL entertainment, to reflect the diversity of its product offerings. In 2012 SHFL obtained the license to distribute Geoff Hall's blackjack variant, Free Bet Blackjack, worldwide excluding the UK and Nevada. At the Global Gaming Expo conference in October 2012, SHFL debuted Mulligan Poker, a game developed by Michael Shackleford and currently only offered online by casinos using IGT software. The game was set to be released in physical casinos in Kansas early in 2013. In July 2013, Bally Technologies agreed to acquire SHFL for about $1.3 billion. The acquisition was completed on November 25, 2013. ==Market position== SHFL had a \\"virtual monopoly\\" in the card shuffler business.

The Ipswich Eagles Football Club is not affiliated with the Ipswich Cats Football Club. ==History== Club History Australian Rules Football within Ipswich has an extremely strong heritage and long-standing history. It has been played here over the last hundred years in various grades and by various teams with mixed levels of success. The Ipswich Eagles Australian Football Club (AFC) has been providing an invaluable service to the local community for 55 years now and has undergone some major changes in venue movement, naming of club, jersey design and playing culture. The Ipswich Eagles AFC was established in 2001 when the former Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Eagles relocated from the RAAF Base at Amberley, to Limestone Park in the centre of Ipswich. The club was formed in 1966 as the RAAF Eagles. A RAAF team playing in the local BAFL competition. The RAAF Eagles home was on RAAF Base Amberley next to the front gate where you can still see the old goal posts. During the RAAF years, the club won the following Premierships: 1976 Division 2, 1980 Division 3, 1999 Division 2 Reserves. In 2000 after struggling to find players all season following the contracting out of all of the F111 maintenance activities, the club members voted to rename the club. Ipswich Eagles AFC was born and relocated to Limestone Park in the centre of Ipswich for the start of the 2001 season. Now no longer a club primarily focused on defence personnel, Ipswich locals flocked to the club happy to have a place to play senior football. The Ipswich Eagles AFC is now a civilian club but still understands and caters for the special needs of players who are also defence personnel. We still have many members who are current or former ADF members. Since the move in 2001 the senior teams have featured in the finals almost every year as well as playing off in 6 grand finals. Six of the club's players have also been named Best and Fairest in their division as voted by the umpires. These players are: 2003 Gregory Jenkins - Division 2, Reserves 2004 Luke Konstanciak - Division 2, Seniors 2005 Luke Konstanciak - Division 1, Seniors 2005 Mark Kennedy - Division 1, Reserves 2007 Luke Konstanciak - Division 2, Seniors 2015 Keith Brick - QAFA (A), Seniors. 2017 Justyn Bilston - Division 3, Reserves 2019 Samara Mahoney - Division 2 North, Senior Women In 2003 a new dimension was added to the club with the inclusion of a women‚Äôs team into the AFLQWL competition. The women played 3 seasons which included one grand final and disbanded. In 2017 the women‚Äôs team took the field again and went on to win the 2019 Premiership. 2004 saw the club form its first U18‚Äôs side which played as the Ipswich Miners to better represent the junior clubs in the area from which the side draws its players. This side no longer exists but many of these U18 players went on to play senior football for the club. Lauchie McHardie was awarded a League Best & Fairest in this period. Our juniors were introduced in 2015 with just 6 kids representing the club in U6‚Äôs. In 2019 we boasted 121 junior Eagles players with that figure expected to grow to over 150 in 2020. Our U13 girls combined with a team from Forest Lake in 2019 and also won the premiership. We also had two players go on to AFL clubs. Rhan Hooper played for the Brisbane Lions and Hawthorn Hawks and Matthew Uebergang was drafted by the Fremantle Football Club. The future is looking super strong with so many juniors playing for our proud club. The Ipswich Eagles AFC is the premier Australian Rules Football Club in the Ipswich and West Moreton region offering senior men, women and juniors the chance to play Australia‚Äôs greatest game. The 2020 season will see the Ipswich Eagles fielding teams for senior men and women, junior boys and girls and with the hope to also expand to U18‚Äôs again in the near future. ==Premierships== * List of Premierships: 1 Women 2019 * Grand Final Appearances (6): ** 2004, 2005, 2012 (Reserves),2017, 2018, 2019 (Women) ==References * Ipswich Eagles AFC on Facebook Category:Australian rules football clubs in Queensland Category:2001 establishments in Australia Category:Australian rules football clubs established in 2001 Category:Sport in Ipswich, Queensland ","title":"Ipswich Australian Football Club"},{"id":"35191878","text":"Kumar Ketkar is an Indian journalist, writer and politician.

Number 7 is a specimen of Calommata transvaalica, a spider from the Blouberg NASA picture of the Blouberg (dark shape, middle right) and the pale Magkabeng Plateau directly to the south of it The Blouberg (formerly \\"Blaauwberg\\"), meaning \\"Blue Mountain\\" in Dutch, is a range of mountains in Limpopo Province, at the far north of South Africa. It is located in Blouberg Local Municipality, Capricorn District. The mountain is entrenched in the history of the local Tswana people, and they have different names for its various parts. The Blouberg forms part of the 'Vhembe Biosphere Reserve', named a biosphere reserve by UNESCO since 2009. This reserve also includes the neighboring Makgabeng Plateau, the Soutpansberg, the northern part of the Kruger National Park, the Makuleke Wetlands and the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape.UNESCO - Biosphere Reserve Information The eastern and part of the central Blouberg prominences are enclosed and protected by the Blouberg Nature Reserve. A 4x4 track traverses Rapanyan's Neck, the defile that separates these easterly subranges. ==Setting== This rocky mountain range rises over a plateau averaging 900 m to the west of the western end of the Soutpansberg range. The Blouberg is topped by massive rocky outcrops resembling castles or fortifications with sheer walls. Its highest point reaches 2,040 m and is also the highest point of the entire Soutpansberg/Blouberg system.Soutpansberg - Introduction The Brak River (also known as Hout River), a tributary of the Sand River, flows diagonally along the southeastern edge of the Blouberg,About Blouberg separating it from the Soutpansberg further east. Although both ranges are clearly delimited from the geographical point of view, geologically the Blouberg is homonymous with the Soutpansberg.Ecoport Soutpansberg ==Human population== About 117 settlements in its foothills are home to some 161,000 inhabitants, belonging to the Bahananwa and Batlokwa communities, and to a lesser extent the VhaVhenda and Northern Sotho. Senwabarwana, the economic centre of these villages, is visited by many to do their shopping. During the 19th century they were incorporated in the South African Republic, and the homeland system was introduced during the Apartheid era of the 20th century. Basic infrastructure and developmental needs were neglected, and in the 21st century it remains one of Limpopo's most underdeveloped regions. Many villages experience high unemployment, severe poverty or low levels of income despite the area's natural resources. Their isolation is mitigated by their sense of community and connectivity to each other. ==Ecology== The vegetation of the Blouberg ranges from sub-tropical veld or savanna at the base, to a kind of Afro-montane vegetation related to the Cape Fynbos near the summits. The rocky cliffs are a haven for birds of prey such as the Cape vultures.Blouberg Nature Reserve, Limpopo The Blouberg, like its larger neighbor further east, the Soutpansberg, is known for a high level of endemism of its invertebrate fauna, such as the Swanepoel's widow butterfly that is found on the southern slopes of the range. The Waterberg flat lizard and a subspecies of the common flat lizard are found in this range. ==Rock climbing== The Blouberg is one of the most spectacular rock climbing areas in South Africa. As a rock climbing destination it is famous for its sheer 350 m \\"Moonshadow\\" wall. Most of the climbing spots are on private land but climbers can make arrangements through the Alldays Mountain Club in nearby Alldays, Limpopo.New Blouberg RD by Hector Pringle ==See also== * List of mountain ranges of South Africa ==References *Major vegetation types of the Soutpansberg Conservancy and the Blouberg Nature Reserve, South Africa *Lepidopterists Society of Africa, Lepsoc.- Blouberg Nature Reserve * Blouberg Municipality Website *African Rock Adventure Category:Mountain ranges of Limpopo ","title":"Blouberg (range)"},{"id":"35192075","text":"The Swiss‚ÄìSouth African Association was an organization based in Switzerland, founded in Zurich in May 1956 to promote relations with South Africa and to function as a Chamber of Commerce.Kreis, Georg.

It deals with the experiences of its protagonist, Serena Frome, during the early 1970s. After graduating from Cambridge she is recruited by MI5, and becomes involved in a covert program to combat communism by infiltrating the intellectual world. When she becomes romantically involved with her mark, complications ensue. McEwan wanted to write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the relationship between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he did play a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work. == Plot summary == The plot is set in early-1970s England. Serena Frome (\\"rhymes with plume\\"), the daughter of an Anglican bishop, shows a talent for mathematics and is admitted to the University of Cambridge. But she struggles academically, and graduates with a third. While at Cambridge she becomes romantically involved with Tony Canning, a professor, who before abruptly ending the affair secures a position for Serena with MI5. The job is low-level, but a more exciting opportunity appears when Serena is offered a chance to take part in a new covert program codenamed \\"Sweet Tooth\\". To counter Communist propaganda during the Cold War, the agency wants to offer financial assistance to young writers, academics and journalists with an anti-Communist bent. Serena, who is an avid and quick reader of fiction, is given the task of vetting burgeoning writer Thomas Haley. Serena is immediately taken by Haley's published short fiction. She travels to the University of Sussex, where he works, to offer him a stipend from the fictional Freedom International Foundation. Soon the two begin a romantic affair, but things gradually start to unravel. Serena discovers that Professor Canning (who, it turns out, broke off their affair only because he knew he was dying from cancer) was in fact a Soviet spy, and she was recruited because the agency wanted to keep tabs on Canning. Then, when Haley's first novel comes out, it is a great critical success, but its dystopian, anti- capitalist theme is not well received by the agency. Finally, his affair with Serena is exposed by the press, and the whole Sweet Tooth program is threatened. Serena fears that she has lost Haley's love forever, now he knows she has deceived him. Haley, however, had known about the program for months, and instead of ending the affair, had decided to turn the story into a novel. The reader now discovers that the author of Sweet Tooth is in fact Haley, despite its being written from Serena's first-person perspective. As the novel ends, Haley asks Serena in a letter to marry him. == Autobiographical elements == Several reviewers have pointed out that the Thomas Haley character shares many traits and biographical details with the author. Like Haley, McEwan studied at the University of Sussex (later also at the University of East Anglia), and not at one of the more prestigious Oxbridge universities. Haley's stories, summarised briefly in the novel, are in several cases strikingly similar to some of McEwan's earlier work. This goes particularly for Haley's dystopian d√©but novel, which closely follows the plot of \\"Two Fragments\\", a short story from McEwan's 1978 In Between the Sheets. The novel wins Haley the fictional Jane Austen Prize for Fiction, just as McEwan's debut First Love, Last Rites was rewarded with the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976. Several of McEwan's acquaintances from this period also make cameo appearances in the novel, including his friend Martin Amis, his first publisher Tom Maschler, and his mentor Ian Hamilton. McEwan has been open about the autobiographical elements in the book, and has called it \\"a muted and distorted autobiography\\" and \\"a muted, or transmuted, memoir of myself as a young writer.\\" There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, \\"unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend.\\" == Genre and style == Sweet Tooth is a love story, a spy novel, and a book about literature itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley ‚Äì she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar ‚Äì have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley on the other hand is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing what appears to be a straight first- person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end. == Themes == McEwan had long wanted to write a novel about the 1970s, a formative period in his life he refers to as \\"the time of my life.\\" For the United Kingdom it was a turbulent period, with striking miners, energy crisis, escalation of the conflict over Northern Ireland, repeated states of emergency and several shifts of government. It was also the period of the Cold War, when Western governments were trying to win the war of ideas against a highly radicalised intelligentsia. Operation Sweet Tooth is entirely fictional, but the story is inspired by the actual scandal affecting the conservative literary magazine Encounter, which in 1967 was revealed to have received covert funding from the CIA. McEwan uses this back-story to explore the relationship between artist and government, and the need for literature to remain independent. According to McEwan, the problem was not the anti-Communist crusade itself, but the secrecy with which it was conducted. \\"All that's really required is that anything the state does in relation to the arts is laid on the table where we can see it.\\" == Critical reception == Julie Myerson of The Observer enjoyed the \\"Russian doll\\" of the novel's multiple layers, and its \\"keen emotional pull.\\" Though she had certain misgivings along the way, she felt that the last few pages answered all her questions and \\"moved [her] almost to tears.\\" Lucy Kellaway of the Financial Times was taken by the stories within the story, and though they tended to \\"suck vivacity from the main narrative\\", she saw this as a device to illuminate the \\"different crafts of writing short stories and novels.\\" Benjamin Errett, writing for the National Post, pointed out how McEwan had blended spy fiction and literary criticism to a combination that was both exciting and intellectually stimulating. In reference to Serena and Tom's different literary preferences, he concluded that \\"[t]his novel is juicy enough to satisfy them both.\\" Other reviewers were less enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraph's Catherine Taylor found the protagonist \\"a little too credulous.\\" She also found McEwan's \\"wilful narrative sadism\\" sadly missing from the work. The review in The Economist was even more critical: referring to Sweet Tooth as \\"not Mr McEwan's finest book\\", the reviewer concluded that by the end, \\"it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth.\\" James Lasdun of The Guardian found that there were \\"momentous political questions\\" raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, \\"to what end?\\" The ending of the book was especially polarising. Kellaway saw it as \\"a good excuse to go back to the beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again\\", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending \\"might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it ... it made me want to throw the book out the window.\\" The statistical journal \\"Significance\\" analyses McEwan's representation of the famous mathematical conundrum: the Monty Hall Problem. == References  External links == * Sweet Tooth on Ian McEwan's official website. * Sweet Tooth on publisher's official website (UK). * Sweet Tooth on publisher's official website (US).

On 27 February 2010 Kluttz won the vacant OVW Heavyweight Championship by winning a Battle Royal. His reign lasted 90 days when he lost the title on 29 May 2010 to Mike Mondo. In mid-2010 it was reported that Kluttz had signed a development contract with WWE. Florida Championship Wrestling (2010‚Äì2012) Kluttz was renamed Brad Maddox and debuted for Florida Championship Wrestling at a live show on August 5, 2010, losing to Tyler Reks. His TV debut was on November 4, 2010, losing to Tito Colon. He won his first match on the July 1, 2011 episode of FCW against Percy Watson and Richie Steamboat. On 22 September edition of FCW Maddox defeated Briley Pierce, three weeks later at the 13 October edition of FCW they built a Tag Team and competed for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship against CJ Parker and Donny Marlow, which they lost. On the November 3 tapings for FCW he won the Tag Team titles with Briley Pierce. On the February 2 tapings they lost their titles due to an injury of Pierce.

On June 21, 2012, he won the FCW Jack Brisco 15 Championship from Richie Steamboat. While holding the FCW 15 Championship, he won the Florida Tag Team Championship with Rick Victor on July 28, 2012. He became the final holder for both titles, as all of FCW's championships were retired when the territory was rebranded as NXT Wrestling. Main roster referee (2012‚Äì2013) Maddox was promoted to the main roster as a referee in August 2012, debuting on the August 20 episode of Raw when he refereed a Divas Battle Royal. On October 28 at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Maddox refereed the main event, a Hell in a Cell match between CM Punk and Ryback for the WWE Championship. As Ryback was about to win the match, Maddox gave Ryback a low blow and proceeded to fast-count a pin for Punk, resulting in Punk retaining his title thus turned Maddox heel for the first time in his WWE career. Ryback brutally attacked Maddox after the match. Maddox explained his actions on the November 5 episode of Raw. He claimed that he was not working for Punk but his actions were self-motivated. Maddox revealed his lifelong dream of becoming a WWE wrestler, but WWE continually rejected him, so he took up the chance to be a referee and attacked Ryback to make a name for himself to earn a contract to become a WWE wrestler. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon then granted Maddox's request at a match against Ryback, while offering a million dollar contract if Maddox won. The next week, Maddox faced Ryback, who soundly defeated him and threw him into an ambulance. Maddox returned in December 2012, now accompanied by his personal cameraman, Carson, and claiming to be a \\"YouTube sensation\\". Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero offered Maddox a contract if he could defeat Randy Orton, but Orton prevailed. Orton was attacked by the Shield after the match. Similar to Maddox, the Shield had earlier aided Punk by attacking Ryback during the duo's WWE Championship match at Survivor Series to ensure Punk's retention of his title and also denied an alliance with Punk. Maddox then took his pleas to SmackDown General Manager Booker T, who thrice granted him opportunities to earn a contract if he could defeat Brodus Clay, The Great Khali, and Sheamus, but Maddox lost all three matches. On the January 28 episode of Raw, via camera footage taken by Maddox's cameraman, it was revealed that Maddox, as well as the Shield, had been working for Punk's manager Paul Heyman all along, although Punk did not appear in the footage and claimed that Heyman had acted independently of him and without his knowledge. Heyman had also instructed the Shield to attack Maddox. The next week on Raw, Maddox revealed he turned in Carson's footage to Vince McMahon and proceeded to call out the Shield, telling them that \\"justice awaits you\\". The Shield answered his challenge by brutally attacking him until John Cena, Sheamus, and Ryback interfered. Raw General Manager (2013‚Äì2015) Maddox in February 2013 On the February 18 episode of Raw, Maddox was rewarded the position of Assistant Raw Managing Supervisor by Vickie Guerrero after revealing that Paul Heyman and CM Punk were working with The Shield. On the April 24 episode of NXT, Maddox challenged Big E Langston for the NXT Championship but was quickly defeated. On the July 8 episode of Raw, after Guerrero was fired as Raw Managing Supervisor when the fans voted that she failed in her role, Maddox was appointed as the new General Manager of Raw. After allowing John Cena to choose Daniel Bryan as his opponent at SummerSlam, Maddox was entwined between Mr. McMahon and Triple H. On the August 12 episode of Raw, Maddox was the special guest referee in the match between Bryan and Wade Barrett, where he gave Barrett the victory after a fast count. Following this, Maddox announced himself as the guest referee in Bryan's match at SummerSlam, only for Triple H to come out and announce he would referee the match instead before giving Maddox a Pedigree. Maddox then formed an alliance with Randy Orton, where he placed Orton's rivals, Dolph Ziggler and Big Show, in handicap matches against The Shield. Maddox continued to have tension with Big Show, who, after refusing to listen to Maddox's orders at Battleground, resulted in Big Show's firing by Stephanie McMahon on the following night's Raw. Later that week on SmackDown, Maddox was knocked out by Big Show, after interrupting him, suffering a concussion in the storyline.http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/2013-10-18/maddox-update-26157366 Maddox returned on the November 11 episode of Raw, where he asserted his authority to Randy Orton, only to be interrupted by the Director of Operations Kane and Vickie Guerrero. The next week on Raw, Maddox was placed in a No Disqualification match against Orton by Triple H; Orton won the match via referee stoppage after Maddox lost consciousness in the storyline and was carried out on a stretcher after getting punched with a microphone 17 times. Following this, Maddox began to compete with Kane to gain favor of The Authority over who ran Raw better before forming an alliance with Kane, aiding him in his feud with CM Punk. At WrestleMania XXX on April 6, 2014, Maddox participated in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal and was quickly eliminated by Cody Rhodes and The Great Khali.http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/30/the-andre-the-giant-memorial- battle-royal-26193641 On the April 25 episode of SmackDown, Maddox took over as General Manager for the night, where he was attacked by The Shield.http://dailyddt.com/2014/04/25/weeks-wwe-smackdown-spoilers-422/ On the May 19 episode of Raw, Maddox defied the orders of Triple H of not allowing any member of The Shield at ringside, by making Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns guest commentators. The following week on Raw, Maddox was relieved of his duties as Raw General Manager by The Authority, before being attacked by Kane. Maddox was absent from WWE television for the remainder of 2014, mainly working house shows. ring during a WWE house show in March 2015 Maddox returned on the April 6, 2015, episode of Raw in a backstage segment with Kane, before being interrupted by Seth Rollins. In August, Maddox began teaming with Adam Rose during live events, calling themselves \\"Beef Mode\\", where they lost to Damien Sandow and Curtis Axel. Later that month, Maddox performed under two different names during dark matches, Joshua Kingsley on August 11 and Lord Ruffles on August 23, losing both matches against Zack Ryder. On the November 17 episode of Main Event, Maddox made his televised return, teaming up with Adam Rose in a losing effort against The Usos.

D. Boyce Council of the Boy Scouts of America serves youth in central Illinois, from Lincoln to Ottawa, and Peoria to Bloomington. ==Organization== The council is divided into districts: * Crossroads District - Serving youth in DeWitt, Livingston, Logan, McLean, and part of Ford county. * Heartland District - Serving youth in Fulton, Marshall, and Peoria counties. * Lowaneu District - Serving youth in Bureau,Putnam, and LaSalle counties. * Wotamalo District - Serving youth in Woodford, Tazewell, Mason, and part of Logan county. ==History== Council HQ Formerly the Starved Rock Area Council, Corn Belt Council and the Creve Coeur Council, W.D. Boyce Council was created by merger and renamed in 1972 in honor of the founder of the BSA, whose grave and monument lie overlooking the Illinois River not far from the Ottawa Scouting Museum in Ottawa, Illinois. The council headquarters is in Peoria, Illinois. The council runs Ingersoll Scout Reservation west of Peoria and Cache Lake Scout Camp in Ontario, Canada. W.D. Boyce Council is served by Wenasa Quenhotan Lodge #23.http://www.wdboyce.org Camp Ki-Shau-Wau is a former Boy Scout camp owned by the Starved Rock Area Council (and later by the W.D. Boyce Council after the merger in 1972) located two miles southeast of Lowell, Illinois along the Vermillion river. Its first name was Camp Pontiac. Shortly after, it was renamed after the three Scouting districts known as Kinebo, Shabbona and Waubuncie (Ki-Shau-Wau). The last official summer camp program was held in 1976. The camp opened in 1926 and was sold in 1989. The site is a private retreat, http://www.kishauwaucabins.com/, today where cabins can be rented. In the movie \\"Fracture\\", Ryan Gosling's character can be seen wearing a Camp Ki-Shau-Wau T-shirt in one scene. Camp Heffernan is a former Boy Scout camp owned by the Corn Belt Council. It is located north of Normal, Illinois on Lake Bloomington. It is now owned by Easter Seals of Central Illinois and has been renamed Timber Pointe Outdoor Center. Camp Wokanda is a former Boy Scout camp located just north of the city of Peoria, Illinois. The grounds are set on the edge of the Illinois River Valley and are bordered by Mossville Road, Mossville proper (and the natural gas pipeline) Colony Point and Deerbrook Subdivisions, and Cedar Hills Road.http://www.peoriaparks.org/camp- wokanda The Boy Scouts sold the property to the Peoria Park District in the 1990s and built a new camp farther north of the city. The Park District rents out the main meeting house for parties and created a few new trails that cross from the Camp over to Robinson Park, which abuts the campgrounds. ==Camps== Ingersoll Scout Reservation Ingersoll Scout Reservation (ISR, or simply Ingersoll) is the primary resident camp of the W.D. Boyce Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Located just west of London Mills, Illinois, the reservation encompasses almost 1000 acres of woodland and prairie between Fulton and Knox Counties. The Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Spoon River, forms most of the southern boundary of the camp. Initially founded as Wilderness Camp in 1963, the camp was renamed in 1973 to posthumously honor William P. Ingersoll, a local philanthropist who helped in the camp's initial purchase. Geography Ingersoll straddles Fulton and Knox Counties, meaning that the Knox portion of the camp actually lies outside of the W.D. Boyce Council. Some of the roads in camp, mostly those built prior to the camp's establishment, follow this county line. Camp roads are mostly unpaved and one-lane, winding around the camp as topography allows. Illinois Route 116 curves around the camp after crossing the Spoon River at London Mills. Route 116 is the camp's primary means of access. For camping purposes, Ingersoll is often divided into two parts: \\"Main Camp,\\" which consists of the developed area west of Lake Roberts used for most camp programs; and the \\"East Side,\\" the large undeveloped area east of Lake Roberts with minimal road and trail access used primarily for hiking. The 14-mile Cedar Creek Trail follows the periphery of the entire camp. The numerous small creeks and gullies emptying into Cedar Creek on the southern edge of Ingersoll gives the camp unusually varied topography for the area. This is most visible at \\"Dining Hall Hill,\\" a main thoroughfare of the camp, which is located on a long incline overlooking the broad Cedar Creek Valley. One minor tributary of the Cedar Creek was dammed in 1963, forming 17-acre Lake Roberts. The camp has another \\"lake\\" in the far East Side, Lake McCutcheon, which is actually a small pond fed by the periodic flooding of the Cedar Creek. Forests at Ingersoll tend to be of relatively young growth, as much of the reservation was formerly farmland. There are notable exceptions to this, especially along the Cedar Creek, where enormous trees have been left undisturbed. The soil of Ingersoll consists largely of loess from the Illinoian glaciation. The reservation is home to many native Illinois wildlife species, including white-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkey, foxes, and coyotes. Beavers have also been known to make their homes on the Cedar Creek, though they are rarely sighted. The entire camp is designated as a wildlife preservation area by the state of Illinois. In less- developed regions of the camp, native prairie grasses have been allowed to grow, creating a habitat for many native plants. Facilities The dining hall is the center of resident camp activities. It includes indoor and outdoor seating, a kitchen, and an adjacent commissary building. Troops have the option of eating at the dining hall or preparing food picked up from the commissary in their own campsites, \\"Jambo style.\\" The flagpole in front of the dining hall is the site of daily flag ceremonies. During the winter months, the dining hall is used for cold-weather camping. The Old Commissary is one of the oldest camp buildings. Originally donated by Caterpillar Inc., the large wooden shed was moved into the camp from another location to serve as camp supply building and trading post. Later, a quartermaster building was built on to the original structure. Following more construction elsewhere in camp during the 1970s, the trading post was converted into the camp office, the commissary into a health lodge and office space, and the quartermaster building into the Wilderness Training Center, a conference room used for training sessions. This facility is also used for lodging during the winter months. In 2007, Ingersoll opened a 50-foot tall climbing tower. It features 3 walls of varying difficulty, a giant's ladder, and a 350-foot zipline to the ground below. The Climbing merit badge is instructed here during summer resident camp. Finished in 2008, the lakefront area at Lake Roberts contains a sand beach, a large dock, boat storage, and teaching space. Boating merit badges, including Rowing, Canoeing, and Small Boat Sailing are taught here during the summer months. Across the lake, the Fish Shack contains teaching space for the Fishing and Fly Fishing merit badges, as well as facilities for cleaning and preparing fish. Other Aquatics merit badges are taught at the pool. There are also many other program areas at Ingersoll, including a shooting range that offers .22 caliber rifles, archery, and 20 gauge shotgun shooting. Scoutcraft offers many programs and merit badges helping the visiting Scouts with their outdoor skills, Scouting lore, and many forms of time-cherished crafts such as woodcarving and basketry. Ecology and Conservation, often referred to as Eco-Con, offers the nature and science merit badges and programs, and hosts many competitions unique to Ingersoll, such as Treemail, a series of challenges that Scouts can undertake as individuals and groups to earn points for their troops. The troop that advances the farthest by the end of the week is recognized at the closing campfire. Ingersoll also offers a cooking program, where Scouts become familiar with outdoor cookware and creative ways to prepare different foods while camping. Ingersoll also offers several Camp Wilderness outposts. In the morning, a troop may choose to go to the Paul Bunyan outpost instead of the normal breakfast at the Dining Hall. Paul Bunyan is an interpretive program based on an old-fashioned Minnesota logger camp, complete with staff in period attire, serving pancakes and sausage for breakfast, and offering such activities as tomahawk throwing, kubb, loggerball, crosscut saws, and spar pole climbing. The lunch activity is a trip down to Crawdad Landing on the Cedar Creek, where Scouts eat a sack lunch and spend an hour sliding down a giant tarp into the creek, often getting extremely muddy in the process. Enduring as one of Ingersoll's most popular attractions, Horseshoe Bend is the dinner outpost and interpretive program based on a cantina in the Old West. The program includes horseshoes, tomahawk throwing, a blacksmith forge, lassoing \\"cattle\\" and even a \\"bucking bronco\\". Much of the food is prepared over an open fire or in Dutch ovens. Dessert consists of IBC Root Beer, kettle corn, and fresh, homemade ice cream, hand-cranked by volunteering Scouts. For a few years in the early 2010s, the Camp Wilderness program incorporated a program called Indian Village. Here, campers had the opportunity to learn Indian Leg Wrestling as well as Indian Stick Wrestling. Later on, campers were able to try their hand at throwing atlatls, a form of Native American spear. This lunch time program, unlike the other main parts of Camp Wilderness, was not made to be a recreation but a historical interpretation of Native American games and activities, presented for the campers. This program has since ended though. Campsites at Ingersoll are divided into three ridges: North, South, and West. North ridge contains the most developed campsites, with platform tents and cots for lodging in the high, shady woods. South Ridge contains a mix of developed and primitive campsites in a lower, forested area. West Ridge campsites are all primitive and in flat, open areas with few pavilions. There are two large shower facilities shared by all campsites, and every campsite has its own latrine and water spigot. In recent years, filtered water \\"hydration stations\\" have been added at various central locations around camp, the first being near the Trading Post. In 2014, ISR replaced its aging pool house facility with a new, modern pool house. The new facility includes changing rooms, showers, and private bathroom facilities. Soon after, much of the aging piping for the pool itself had to be replaced early on in the summer of 2014 due to several breakages that made the pool unusable. As well as the new pool facilities, wilderness engineers at ISR helped install new cabins near the shooting ranges before the 2014 camping season. The cabins initially provided more and better accommodations for the summer-long staff until the RMS Lodge was built in 2018-19. They now are used for off-season camping and may someday become a new campsite on North Ridge. The new RMS Lodge houses 44 staff members during the summer and acts as the premier conference center during the off-season. It is climate-controlled, and it includes heated floors, a kitchen, laundry machines, and a large meeting room. The summer of 2014 also saw the addition of a new STEM area. The area is used to cover many new merit badges, including Game Design, Aviation, Space Exploration. The area is located at the former Chaplain's Shelter next to the Wilderness Training Center and Camp Office. History In the late 1950s, the Creve Coeur Council faced growing problems with its existing resident camp, Camp Wokanda. Its facilities, mostly constructed in the 1920s and 1930s, were inadequate, and it was being encroached upon by the urban sprawl of nearby Peoria. In 1960 it was decided that a new camp should be constructed, far enough from civilization that boys' survival skills could be put to the test. Other criteria for this new camp included a lake, a river, and enough space to allow campsites privacy and community. Many sites were considered, but eventually a 600-acre plot located 36 miles west of Peoria on Illinois Route 116 near London Mills was chosen for its rolling hills, meadows, and natural woodlands, as well as its river access and location within the famous Spoon River country. The site also contained a brick ranch-style house far from the main road, considered perfect for housing a camp ranger. With a site decided, the Creve Coeur Council then focused its efforts on paying for the land. At $60,000 (roughly $428,000 today), finding the money proved to be difficult. Hoping to find one donor who could cover the whole cost, an appeal was made to William P. Ingersoll, a philanthropist from nearby Canton, Illinois. After confirming for himself the validity of the request, Ingersoll agreed to pay for the entire property on the condition that his donation remain anonymous. So it was that in 1963, Wilderness Camp officially opened for its first camping season. Over the next decade, Ingersoll continued to anonymously fund the camp, allowing for the construction of new buildings and the acquisition of surrounding land, eventually bringing the camp to its current 960 acres. Following Ingersoll's death in 1972, the camp was renamed Ingersoll Scout Reservation in his honor with the permission of his remaining family. Folklore In Ingersoll's time as a Boy Scout camp, many rumors and myths about the camp have emerged among campers and staff. These stories are a vital part of the camp's identity. * Given Ingersoll's strange asymmetrical layout, there has been much speculation over what was to become of the East Side. The most popular theory is that the East Side was supposed to become its own resident camp, but plans to do so were abandoned. * It is said that the original owners of the brick ranch house (later moved to the front gate) were a businessman and his wife. The man would be away on business so frequently that his wife became despondent from the isolation. Eventually she couldn't bear it any longer and hung herself in the shed behind the house. That shed, the Cedar Del Farm building, still stands to this day. * There are many things rumored to be submerged in Lake Roberts, including a bulldozer (mired in mud during construction and impossible to remove) and an M16 rifle (dropped by an ROTC cadet doing aquatic exercises). * Lakefront staff have long told of a gargantuan snapping turtle nicknamed \\"Jaws\\" that patrols the lake, stealing bait from hooks and putting up legendary fights on the line. Though many report sightings of Jaws, he (or she) has always managed to elude capture. The one exception being a brief capture and release in 2012. Cache Lake Scout Camp Cache Lake Scout Camp is located at Sand Point Lake Ontario. The original high adventure camp that would evolve into Cache Lake Scout Camp was located approximately 70 miles north of International Falls, Minnesota in an abandoned logging camp on Lake of the Woods at Nestor Falls in 1957. The camp was moved to Browns Bay in Crane Lake in northern Minnesota approximately 3 years later and named Cache Lake Scout Camp. The camp was moved one other time to north of the Canadian / U.S. border to what is now known as Bach's Bay. The history of the creation and evolution of Cache Lake Scout Camp has been reproduced with the author's permission (J.N. Bach) at the \\"Evolution of Cache Lake\\" website provided. ==Wenasa Quenhotan Lodge== The council is served by the Wenasa Quenhotan Lodge of the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouting program's national honor society. ==See Also== *Scouting in Illinois ==References * W.D.

The word \\"kura\\" is most commonly associated with the saddle used by the samurai class of feudal Japan. Over time the Japanese added elements of their own until the Japanese saddle became an identifiable style, also known as the samurai saddle. ==History and description== The Japanese were known to be using the Chinese style of saddle during the Nara period (AD 710 to 794), but during the Heian (794 to 1185), changes made to the Chinese saddle led to what we now call the kura or Japanese saddle. The Chinese style saddle is known as karagura while the Japanese style is known as yamatogura.Handbook to Life in Medieval and Early Modern Japan, Author William E. Deal, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007, , P.156 In the fourth century AD, the Japanese started using horses in warfare.Nussbaum, Louis Fr√©d√©ric and K√§the Roth.

Cavalry proved to be decisive in the Jinshin War of 672‚Äì73, in Fujiwara no Hirotsugu's rebellion in 740 and in the revolt of Fujiwara no Nakamaro in 756.Friday, Karl F. (1996). Samurai warriors increasingly used horses,Turnbull, Stephen R. (2002). and rode two types of kura: the suikangura or \\"aristocratic saddle\\", and the gunjingura, or war saddle. The main weapon of early samurai warfare was the yumi (bow) and the kura provided a rugged, stable, comfortable platform for shooting arrows. However, the design was not well suited for speed or distance. The introduction of firearms in Japan in 1543 eventually led to the development of the Japanese matchlock (tanegashima) which supplanted the yumi as the weapon of choice by the samurai. As a result, horse-mounted samurai were no longer the main military force. During the Edo period (1603 to 1868) horses were no longer needed for warfare and the samurai started using highly decorated kura with colored lacquers, and extensive intricate inlays and leather work. Mounted samurai became a ceremonial presence in the entourages of processions by their daimy≈ç (feudal lord).Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan (Google eBook), Karl F.
