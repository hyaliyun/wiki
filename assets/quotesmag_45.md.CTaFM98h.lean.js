He joined his father in practice at Cavendish Place in London and became one of the best known dental surgeons of his day, becoming President of the British Dental Association in 1899 and of the F.D.I. in 1914. During World War I, although aged over 70, he was appointed Registrar and Superintendent of the Maxillo- facial Hospital at Kennington. He married Mary Lily Lockhart, the daughter of William Lockhart (1811–1897), famed medical missionary and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (UK). Mummery wrote at least two texts, Microanatomy of the Teeth (Henry Frowde, Oxford University Press: 1919) and Microscopic and General Anatomy of the Teeth: Human and Comparative. He lived at 79 Albert Bridge Road, Wandsworth, London at the time the first text was published. His wife, Mary, died from acute pneumonia on 24 May 1897 at the age of 48 at Whitby. The British Dental Association presents a Howard Mummery Prize for dental research, which was first awarded to J H Scott in 1963.

The Sistan Basin is an endorheic basin and encompasses a complex system of rivers, shallow lakes, marshes and wetlands as its watershed, draining into the Hamun Lakes in southeastern Iran. Occasional outflows from these lakes are carried back into Afghanistan by the seasonal Shile river to the basin's terminus, the Godzareh depression in Afghanistan. The depression is flat and very shallow with fine textured sediment at its lowest portions. The lowest section of the Godzareh depression is 467 m above sea level. The depression only receives runoff water when the main tributaries are overflowing every 10 years on the average. In general, a geological depression is a landform that is sunken or lower than the surrounding area. The Godzareh depression is the lowest point in the Sistan Basin in Afghanistan and therefore is the terminus to which all the water flows. ==Water supply obligations== Under an accord signed between Iran and Afghanistan in 1972, Afghanistan is obliged to release water at a rate of at least . The Taliban briefly stopped the flow of water to Iran when the latter threatened to attack in retaliation for the killing of Iranians who were claimed to be diplomats in Mazari Sharif when the Taliban retook the city from the Northern Alliance the second time. During that time Helmand valley was going through a five-year drought. To make good on its threat, the Taliban diverted southward, through a canal the entire flow of the Helmand, into the Gowd Zerrah/Zerah Depression (Godzareh depression). While the Zerah filled up with Helmand waters and uselessly, Iran's famous Hamun-e Helmand lake dried up as did other regional pastures, leading to the death of flora, fauna, cattle and birds in the Sistan and Baluchestan Province of Iran.Hirmand River's water to flow into Iran again, soon: Afghan source, December 12, 2002 Time Series of Water in Lake Hamoun, Iran/Afghanistan.

The original East Howe School was built in 1912 by Dorset County Council when the area was rural. The school was brought under the control of Bournemouth Local Education Authority in 1931 when Bournemouth extended its boundaries to include the area. The school grew rapidly and the seniors moved to their new building along Hadow Road (supposedly named after Henry Hadow of the Hadow Report of 1926). During World War II, the school was utilized as a hospital. The original 1912 school is now used as a youth centre. 1967-1999: Kingsleigh Secondary School In 1967 the boys and girls schools merged to become Kingsleigh Secondary School.http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/snapshotsofthepast/9693255.East_Howe_School_through_the_ages/ The local infant school and junior school were also renamed Kingsleigh. A number of buildings were added to the school until it was put in special measures. 2000-2009: Kings High School In 2000 the school was renamed Kings High School. The school was led by Mr Gareth Jones who, within five years, turned Kings High into Bournemouth's most improved school - with 60% of its pupils achieving five A* to C's, compared with 24% in 2001. Kings High School was led by Alyn Fendley up until 2010, the year the school was renovated and renamed 'The Bourne Academy'. 2010-Present: The Bourne Academy, Sixth Form and BSF On 1 September 2010, Kings High became The Bourne Academy, which still operates out of the old Kings High site, which was renovated. The school is also sponsored by Canford School. The Academy is underwent a government funded revival of schools all around the country. This was called BSF (Building Schools for the Future). The nominated BSF Team from Kings High attended conferences in Bournemouth and London along with other schools around Bournemouth. The main east and west wing building is pre World War II, but was refurbished in Quarter 2 and 3 of 2012. The Academy has built a new science block, design and technology block and a new canteen and dance studio called \\"The Hub\\", the newly refurbished main building and Sports Hall and extension of the Science block. The Academy then underwent a 10 million pound building work project completed in August 2013, The Academy now also has a new Maths and English block, additional food room, sixth form building, library and reception. The Academy opened a Sixth form in September 2013. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Bourne Academy official website Category:Schools in Bournemouth Category:Secondary schools in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Category:Academies in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole ","title":"The Bourne Academy"},{"id":"12351204","text":"Panicum socotranum is a species of grass in the family Poaceae.

In the United States, the farm bill is the primary agricultural and food policy tool of the federal government. The comprehensive omnibus bill is renewed every 5 years or so and deals with both agriculture and all other affairs under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture. Congress is involved in overseeing the implementation of farm bills as well as being responsible for developing and enacting the legislation.Johnson, R. and Monke, J. (8 March 2019). 2018 Farm Bill Primer: What is the Farm Bill?. Congressional Research Service Report. Retrieved from https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11126 It usually makes amendments and suspensions to provisions of permanent law, reauthorizes, amends, or repeals provisions of preceding temporary agricultural acts, and puts forth new policy provisions for a limited time into the future. Beginning in 1933, farm bills have included titles on commodity programs, trade, rural development, farm credit, conservation, agricultural research, food and nutrition programs, marketing, etc.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms Programs and Laws, 2005 Edition – Order Code 97-905 , Farm bills can be highly controversial and can impact international trade, environmental conservation, food safety, and the well-being of rural communities. Having such a wide variety of topics in one omnibus bill has been brought into question, especially putting together the agricultural and nutrition parts. However, doing so helps to bridge some of the politically relevant cultural differences that exist between legislators of urban and rural, coastal and heartland areas of the country . Traditionally, the agriculture programs have been more important for rural areas of the heartland, while urban and coastal regions have been more concerned with the nutrition assistance programs. There are stakeholders outside of the government that are also interested in food and agriculture issues. These include national farm groups, commodity associations, state organizations, nutrition and public health officials, advocacy groups representing conservation, recreation, rural development, faith-based interests, local food systems, and organic production. Putting nutrition and agriculture topics together allows for stakeholders and advocacy coalitions with different interests to find common ground on topics that are potentially contentious between them . Some of the programs that are authorized in a farm bill fall into the spending category of mandatory, while others are discretionary. Programs with mandatory funding have their funds authorized directly within the farm bill. On the other hand, programs with discretionary funding require for congressional appropriators to designate funding to them because they are not funded directly in the farm bill. Cost projections for funding estimates are calculated by the Congressional Budget Office using a baseline, which is an estimate of future costs over 10 years if the existing costs were to continue unchanged. Adjustments to funding levels between programs generally occurs from one year to the next, incrementally. On May 18th, 2018 the $867 billion 2018 United States farm bill failed in the House of Representatives with a vote of 198 yea to 213 nay. All Democrats and 30 Republicans voted against the measure. Republican opposition came largely from the Freedom Caucus who insisted that a separate vote to restrict immigration be held before they would support the bill. Democratic opposition was largely due to the proposed changes to the attached Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that would impose work requirements. After the 2014 farm bill expired in September of 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law December 20, 2018. ==History of farm bills before 2000== Farm bills were first created during the Great Depression to give financial assistance to farmers who were struggling due to an excess crop supply creating low prices, and also to control and ensure an adequate food supply. On May 12th, 1933 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1933 into law as part of his New Deal. The AAA had two main objectives: 1) To help farmers who were severely in debt, and 2) To raise the prices of farm goods. The bill allowed farmers to receive payment for not growing food on a percentage of their land as allocated by the United States Secretary of Agriculture. It also enabled the government to buy excess grain from farmers, which could then be sold later if bad weather or other circumstances negatively affected output. The AAA also included a nutrition program, the precursor to food stamps. The AAA of 1933 was an abrupt change in policy and was designed as an emergency response to the low prices of commodity crops during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl in the years prior to 1933. The AAA established a primary federal role in limiting the production of certain agricultural crops including wheat, corn, and cotton to reduce supply in order to increase prices. The years before the passage of the AAA was a time of great difficulty for American farmers; at the end of World War I US farmers supplied the European markets until they rebuilt their agricultural sectors. Once the Europeans restored their farmland sufficiently to meet their agricultural needs, US farmers lost an important export market. The diminished market for American farm commodities led to a surplus of crops, which depressed prices. The Great Depression further stressed the already struggling agricultural sector, and many farmers were at risk of foreclosure. In this time of agricultural crisis, farmers continued to produce as much as possible in the hopes that selling high quantities would make up for low prices, exacerbating the cyclical problem of surplus and low prices. At the same time, the urban areas faced high unemployment, so the entire nation was struggling economically. President Roosevelt's New Deal legislation focusing on agriculture paid farmers to reduce the number of productive acres on their farms, ultimately limiting the supply of commodity crops on the market. The goal was to increase the price of farm commodities by reducing overall supply, while also providing relief to farmers who were deeply in debt. This was, however, a voluntary program, meaning farmers were not required to remove acres from production if they were not interested in government assistance. Those who participated tended to remove land from production that was already producing poorly, thereby reducing their yield as little as possible, and ultimately limiting the effectiveness of the Act. The AAA was short-lived as the Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional on January 6th, 1936. This was partially due to the processing tax that was used to finance payments to farmers and partially because the Court ruled government regulation of agricultural production within the states unconstitutional. In 1938, Congress created a more permanent farm bill (the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938) with a built-in requirement to update it every five years. In 1996, the first major structural change was made to the farm bill when Congress decided farm incomes should be determined by free market forces and stopped subsidizing farmland and purchasing extra grain. Instead, the government began requiring farmers to enroll in a crop insurance program in order to receive farm payments. This led to years of the highest farm subsidies in American history. Direct payments also began in the late 1990s as a way to support struggling farmers, regardless of crop output. These payments allowed grain farmers to receive a government check every year based on yields and acreage of the farm as recorded the previous decade. ==History of farm bills since 2000== The first farm bill of the new millennium was the Farm Security Act of 2002, which was signed into law on May 13, 2002USDA Farm Policy Team. (22 May 2002). The 2002 Farm Bill: Provisions and Economic Implications. Retrieved fromhttps://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42660/13780_ap022_4_.pdf?v=0. Some of the bill’s major changes in comparison to the 1996 bill include an alteration of the farm payment program and the introduction of counter- cyclical farm income support. It also mandates the expansion of conservation land retirement programs and places an emphasis on environmental practices on the farm. Importantly, it restores the eligibility of legal immigrants to food stamps. Additionally, the 2002 farm bill relaxes the rules of the previous farm bill so that more borrowers may be eligible for Federal farm credit assistance, includes several commodities in the list of those that require labeling from their country of origin, and includes new provisions on the welfare of animals. In 2008, the farm bill was passed as the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The bill included approximately $100 billion in annual spending for Department of Agriculture programs, around 80 percent of which was allocated for food stamps and other nutritional programs. The 2008 Farm bill increased spending to $288Bn therefore causing controversy at the time by increasing the budget deficit. It increased subsidies for biofuels which the World Bank has named as one of three most important contributors, along with high fuel prices and price speculation, to the 2007–2008 world food price crisis.Global Economic Prospects: Commodities at the Crossroads, World Bank Report 2009 page 52, President George Bush had vetoed the 2008 bill due to its size and cost. However, the veto was overridden by Congress. The 2008 bill was also publicly controversial due to its high cost and the uneven distribution of subsidy money among farmers. The bill was 47 percent more expensive than the 2003 bill, and, over the previous ten years, 10 percent of farmers had received 75 percent of subsidy dollars. Some of these farm owners were then-members of Congress and other public figures, including former president Jimmy Carter, who received thousands of dollars in direct payments. In 2007, it was found that about 62 percent of farmers do not receive subsidies from the farm bill. In 2012, while writing the new farm bill, known as the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act, Congress proposed many ways to cut down the overall cost of the bill, including stricter eligibility standards for food stamps and moving away from direct payments to farmers. However, food stamps and nutrition remained the largest portion of the bill's cost, amounting to a proposed $768.2 billion over ten years. The 2012 bill ultimately failed to pass in the House, which caused Congress to extend the 2008 bill until September 30, 2013. This was enacted as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, passed by Congress on January 1, 2013 and signed into law the next day by President Barack Obama. (Public Law No: 112-240) Between the passage of the 2008 farm bill and the creation of the 2013 bill, the food stamp program changed its name to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and nearly doubled in size. The proposed 2013 bill would cut funding to SNAP by about $400 million a year, which amounts to half a percent of spending from previous years. Under an amendment introduced by Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), it would also reduce crop insurance subsidies by 15 percent for the top 1 percent of U.S. wealthiest farmers, those with a gross annual income of more than $750,000. The new bill also proposed a new insurance program for dairy producers which would cut costs by eliminating other dairy subsidies and price supports. The 2013 farm bill was approved in the Senate on June 10, 2013 but did not pass the House. The 2014 Farm bill, known as the Agricultural Act of 2014, was passed by Congress and signed into law on February 7, 2014, 2 years late, as authority under its predecessor, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 had expired September 30, 2012. The 2018 Farm bill, or Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, was passed by Congress and signed into law on December 20, 2018. It primarily reauthorized many programs in the 2014 Farm Bill. ==Non-farm bill agriculture legislation== * Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 *Frazier–Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act of 1934 * Bankhead- Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 *Farm Credit Act of 1971 ==Farm bills== According to a Congressional Research Service primer about the 2018 farm bill, eighteen farm bills have been enacted since the 1930s. #Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 #Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 #Agricultural Act of 1948 #Agricultural Act of 1949 #Agricultural Act of 1954 #Agricultural Act of 1956 #Food and Agriculture Act of 1965 # Agricultural Act of 1970 # Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 # Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 # Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 # Food Security Act of 1985 # Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 # Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 # Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 # Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 # Agricultural Act of 2014 #Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ==Proposed farm bills== * Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (H.R. 1947; 113th Congress) () – failed passage in the House * Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (S. 954; 113th Congress) () – passed the Senate, failed in the House ==See also== *Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Bosso, Christopher.

The incident was the largest one-day homicide of law enforcement officers in North Carolina history. The incident inspired a motion picture and also promoted changes in law enforcement protocols statewide for interagency reporting of officer murders, radio cross-communication between local agencies and the NC State Highway Patrol, which dispatches for most NC state law enforcement agencies and training protocols for response to domestic disturbance incidents. The murdered officers were: Rutherford County NC sheriff's deputies Captain Roy Huskey and Deputy Owen Messersmith and NC State Highway Patrol Trooper Robert L. \\"Pete\\" Peterson. Hutchins was executed at the age of 54 by the State North Carolina at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina by lethal injection. He became the first person to be executed in North Carolina since 1977 when the death penalty was reinstated. ==Personal life== Hutchins was born March 26, 1929 in Rutherford County, North Carolina. At the time of his publicized arrest in 1979, Hutchins was married to Geneva Hutchins and had three children, daughters Charlotte and Lisa and son James Jr.Gordon, Jean. \\"Deadly Shootings 30 years ago\\". The Sunday Courier. 31 May 2009 While living in North Carolina, he worked at various occupations, including as a textile machinist and a woodcutter.Chronology of Key events in James Hutchins story\\" The Associated Press. Print. DOC Public Affairs He was unemployed at the time of the 1979 murder of the three lawmen. Hutchins had a reputation as a violent and dangerous man with a \\"short fuse\\" temper. He was reputed to assault others for little or no provocation and to routinely assault his wife and children. ==First legal troubles; US Air Force== Hutchins served in the US Air Force during the Korean War era and was trained as a rifleman; a skill which he used in the 1979 incident. He was ultimately discharged for inappropriate conduct by the Air Force; for going AWOL and for being charged with a civilian charge of murder while he was AWOL in New Mexico. Though the murder charge was later dropped, he was separated from the US Air Force for AWOL under a bad conduct discharge. ==First murder charge; New Mexico== In April 1954, Hutchins was arrested for first degree murder while AWOL from the US Air Force in New Mexico. That murder charge was dropped due to insufficient evidence and Hutchins was returned to military custody, where he was discharged for bad conduct. ==Other legal troubles== Following the New Mexico arrest and his discharge from the Air Force, Hutchins also had several other serious brushes with the law, including his December 1966 NC charge of assault and battery with intent to kill after attacking the husband of his ex- wife.http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/pending/1980s.htm Prior to May 31, 1979, Hutchins was also charged with shooting an unarmed man. ==First imprisonment; the NC officer murders== On the night of May 31, 1979 James W. Hutchins gunned down Rutherford County NC deputy sheriffs Captain Roy Huskey, 42, brother of the Rutherford County Sheriff Damon Huskey, and Deputy Owen Messersmith, 58, when they arrived separately at the Hutchins residence in Rutherford County, located in the foothills-mountain region of Western North Carolina. The officers had responded to a domestic disturbance call involving Hutchins and his teenage daughter Charlotte, who had returned home to prepare for her high school graduation that evening and making an alcoholic drink for a party afterwards.I lived through this in 1979 Susan Carol Wells This caused Hutchins to become enraged and assaultive towards his daughter. When other family members tried to protect Charlotte, he became violent with the rest of his family. Charlotte escaped and fled to a neighbor's house where the sheriff's office was called. Hutchins shot Captain Huskey in the head with a high- powered rifle, ambush-style from within his home, as he exited his patrol car which was parked in the driveway in the front of the Hutchins' home. Deputy Messersmith was dispatched several minutes later to check on the captain who had not radioed or called in. Upon arriving, Messersmith apparently saw the captain lying beside his vehicle and realized that Huskey had been fatally shot. As he shifted into reverse and started to back away to cover, Messersmith too was shot in the head through the windshield of his patrol car. The vehicle drifted backwards across the street and came to rest in a ditch with Messersmiths' body slumped over the steering wheel, causing the horn to blow without stop. A frantic neighbor called the sheriff's office to report that two deputies had been shot in the Hutchins driveway. Confusion ensued at the sheriff's office, as the radio dispatcher on duty fainted when told that the 2 officers had been shot. A jailer in the jail in the next room heard the radio, but became concerned that he did not hear the dispatcher. Upon entering the dispatch area, he realized the dispatcher was passed out and began to answer phones while calling an ambulance for the dispatcher. All available ambulances were speeding to the Hutchins residence at the time, adding to the chaos. The jailer did not know to notify state highway patrol regional headquarters in Asheville, so that troopers could be alerted of the situation to respond to assist and also to get a description of the shooter and his vehicle. Immediately after he murdered the 2 deputies, Hutchins fled the scene in his own car, still armed with his high-powered rifle. NC State Highway Patrol Trooper Robert L. \\"Pete\\" Peterson, 37, was stopped at the McDowell- Rutherford County line, to the North of Rutherfordton, on US Highway 221, pulled alongside and talking to a fellow trooper assigned to neighboring McDowell County. Peterson suddenly heard garbled radio traffic on the Rutherford County Sheriff's frequency on his scanner. At that time, troopers often used personally-owned scanners in their patrol cars, to monitor local law enforcement radio calls, which were on differing high-band frequencies from the State Highway Patrol's low-band frequencies. Though Peterson could not make out what was happening, he suspected something was wrong and left toward Rutherfordton. In the pre-cell phone era, Peterson radioed the Troop \\"G\\" communications center at the Asheville SHP HQ and asked state highway patrol dispatchers to call the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office and find out what was happening and if anything was wrong. With the advent of in-vehicle computer terminals, and a decrease of radio usage, the NC SHP closed the Asheville communications center in 2014 and moved operations to Newton, near Hickory NC, leaving just the administrative Troop G Headquarters command and vehicle repair garage in Asheville. But in 1979, as was the case with many rural NC counties, the Rutherford County Sheriff's communications center dispatched for all emergency and law enforcement agencies in the county except for state officers. State highway patrol dispatchers called the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office repeatedly, but were not able to get through due to the chaos. They were also unable to get a computer reply either, because the jailer attending the phones did not know how to use the then-new North Carolina statewide Police Information Network computer system (PIN/later changed to the Division of Criminal Information [DCI]), the NC link of the FBI's nationwide National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Having used the PIN computer system would have enabled fast communications between the agencies in lieu of the overloaded phone lines. The chaotic situation and unlikely series of unfortunate events prevented troopers in the region from getting an immediate situation report on the incident. Troopers were thus unaware that two Rutherford County officers had been murdered and that the suspect was at large in his car. Had the SHP dispatch center been alerted, they could have located vehicle registration records on Hutchin's vehicle and issued a description to regional troopers. As Trooper Peterson entered the Rutherfordton city limits on US 221, Hutchins sped past the him. Peterson turned and pursued, apparently thinking he was simply pursuing a speeder, unaware that the suspect had just murdered 2 sheriff's deputies. Peterson's last radio transmission to Highway Patrol HQ in Asheville was to give his location and to say the suspect had fled on foot, that he was running to the tree line. Troopers from across the region were made aware of the 2 Rutherford deputies having been murdered and that the suspect was still at large, just as radio contact was lost with Peterson. Troopers who were rushing to assist Rutherford County officers at the murder scene realized that Peterson may have unknowingly encountered the killer of the deputies. Slews of on and off-duty troopers began to speed to his location when he did not check in again. Responding troopers arrived to find Peterson's patrol car with the blue light on the roof flashing and the driver's door open. It was stopped on the northbound shoulder of a sharp curve on US 221 north of Rutherfordton, a distance behind Hutchins' car which was stopped near the tree line. Trooper Peterson was slumped by the driver's side of his patrol car mortally wounded, suffering from a gunshot wound to the head. His revolver was drawn and had been fired one time. It was never definitively determined if he had the time to have fired at Hutchins and it was not possible to recover a spent projectile, if any, from Peterson's pistol in an open area of the foothills. Fellow Troopers noted that Peterson often would shoot rattlesnakes he might encounter on the highway, though he was also known to immediately reload his .357 revolver so he would have a \\"full cylinder\\" in the event that he was forced to engage in a gunfight. His body position was consistent with his having apparently used his vehicle engine block for cover, a standard tactic for troopers. ==Peterson legacy with NCSHP== Trooper Robert L. \\"Pete\\" Peterson was affectionately known as \\"super trooper\\" by other officers and troopers. He had transferred to Rutherford County two years prior to his murder. He was a former US Army and Vietnam veteran who had joined the SHP in 1969. Peterson was a revered and almost mythical figure in NC Highway Patrol history. He had served as the longest-assigned physical training (PT) instructor in the history of the NC Highway Patrol Training Center, and according to legends, he was the toughest. He trained close to ten trooper cadet classes, first at the Institute of Government at UNC Chapel Hill (now the School of Government) and lastly at the present-day training center in Raleigh. Peterson was known as a physical \\"machine\\" with untiring stamina and endurance: he would lead grueling runs of 3–5 miles with the trooper cadets for scheduled morning PT, 5 days a week, pushing even the most fit cadets to sheer exhaustion, as he prepared them for the rigors of trooper life. After morning PT, in lieu of breakfast, he would then run over a mile to the municipal public golf course with his golf clubs on his back and play 18 fast holes of golf, then run back to the training center and conduct daily training, then lead remedial PT runs with cadets who were not keeping up physically and were on remediation in the evenings. Troopers who he trained over the years jokingly would say with fond reverence that someone as tough as Pete Peterson was eternally keeping troopers who had passed on or been killed in the line of duty in shape as the PT trainer in Heaven. In 2010, the NC Highway Patrol named and dedicated the physical training field and running track at the Training Center in Raleigh \\"Peterson Field' in honor of Trooper RL \\"Pete\\" Peterson. ==Hutchins' final arrest== James Hutchins was captured in a dense thicket in Rutherford County on June 1, 1979 after a 12-hour search conducted by over 200 local, state and federal law enforcement officers from across Western North Carolina and Upstate South Carolina. This event was later recounted in a feature film, Damon's Law by a local film producer near Rutherford County. Due to the widespread anger of local residents in Rutherford County against Hutchins for having murdered three respected and well-liked area lawmen, Hutchins was jailed the next day in Shelby Cleveland County, North Carolina for his own safety. He was later transferred to the more-secure Buncombe County jail for safekeeping in Asheville, North Carolina. Trooper Peterson was one of 14 NC troopers killed in the western mountains of NC Highway Patrol Troop \\"G\\", which is nearly 1/4 of all troopers to die in the line of duty statewide in North Carolina since the Highway Patrol was established in 1929, making Troop \\"G\\" referred to as the walking dead in some NC law enforcement circles ==Hutchin's triple murder trial== On June 12, 1979, Hutchins' oldest daughter, Charlotte, testified in Rutherford County that on the day of the murders her father beat her and other members of their family. The disagreement was over the amount of vodka the daughter had poured into a punch for a high school graduation party. As the trial opened on September 17, 1979, Hutchins pleaded not guilty following the prosecutor's demand that he receive the death penalty. Days later, the jury found Hutchins guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder. The same jury ruled that Hutchins should die in the state's gas chamber. Presiding Judge Donald Smith set October 12, 1979 as Hutchins' execution date, also referring to Hutchins as \\"the most dangerous man I've ever seen.\\" Appeals brought an automatic delay. Superior Court Judge Lacy Thornburg, who would later serve as NC Attorney General and as a Federal Judge, later set October 15, 1981 as the date of execution. However, further appeals pushed the date to January 22, 1982. Prior to this scheduled execution date, the NC State Supreme Court granted a stay so further appeals could be pursued. A new date was set for October 15, 1982; however, this was also delayed by further appeals. ==Aftermath== The State Highway Patrol made a concerted effort to have better and timelier communications with local law enforcement agencies after the Rutherford County tragedy, which was the worst one-day felonious loss of life of peace officer life in NC law enforcement history. A previous and similar incident occurred in 1975, when a NC Highway Patrolman was similarly killed (the title of \\"Trooper\\" was changed in 1977 when women were admitted to the ranks). In that incident, NC Highway Patrolman G.T. Davis of Troop \\"A\\" was shot to death in downtown Williamston (Martin County) in Eastern NC, when he too stopped a car that was wanted. In his case, he stopped a car for running a red light at the US 64 and US 17 intersection, but he was unaware that minutes earlier, the 3 suspects had just robbed a bank in Jamesville, 10 miles to the east. Martin County officials had failed to report the robbery and suspects' description to the Highway Patrol. Law enforcement personnel across North Carolina continue to this day to chronicle the Rutherford County tragedy, to emphasize the dangers of domestic disputes to law enforcement officers. Response to domestic violence calls, related tactics and training protocols were changed and standardized for all NC peace officers in both basic and in-service training by the NC Criminal Justice Training and Standanrd Commission as a result of this incident, in order to emphasize and enhance officer safety. ==Hutchins' execution== On September 8, 1983, a new execution date was set for January 13, 1984. On January 6, leading up to his execution, James Hutchins chose lethal injection as his means of execution. Hutchins was ultimately executed in North Carolina on March 16, 1984. ==Charges of political overtones in the execution== Leading up to Hutchins' execution on March 16, 1984, the then-NC Governor, James B. Hunt, a popular 2-term moderate Democrat was locked in a bitter US Senate election bid against the conservative icon; Republican 2-term US NC Senator Jesse Helms, the famous incumbent. Some charged that Hunt used his position and influence as governor to expedite Hutchins' execution to occur prior to the fall election, in order to project himself as a hard-on-crime/pro-police, law-and-order conservative democrat, to offset charges from Helms that he was too liberal for North Carolina. Because Hutchins had killed 3 lawmen and was poor and white, some argued he was the perfect political \\"poster-boy\\" to execute, arguing that if he was black, public outcry from the traditionally liberal and democratic black electorate would have possibly prevented Hunt politically from allowing his execution. Hunt did not commute the death sentence and it was carried out at Central Prison in Raleigh. Public opinion polls just prior indicated there was overwhelming support across all political and racial lines in North Carolina for the execution of Hutchins. Though the execution did occur prior to the 1984 fall election, Governor Hunt still lost the senate race to Senator Helms by a substantial margin, in the same year that Ronald Reagan won a landslide reelection as President over former Vice President Walter Mondale. Jesse Helms went on to serve 2 more terms in a 24-year senate career, the longest in modern NC history and a first for a Republican. Jim Hunt, who was said by many political pundits to be politically finished after his stunning loss to Helms, would again run for governor and be reelected as governor in 1992 and again in 1996 for 2 more terms, a total of 4 terms/16 years as North Carolina's Governor, also a state record. Hunt would later comment that his role in executing Hutchins was a proud moment of his political legacy and that it was the \\"right thing to do\\". ==See also== * Capital punishment in North Carolina * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in North Carolina ==ReferencesSources== * Offender Data Screen.

Currently, he is the host of three television programs. P. Allen Smith's Garden Home and P. Allen Smith's Garden to Table are distributed to public television by American Public Television.Garden to Table His 30-minute show Garden Style is syndicated by The Television Syndication Company. Smith is one of America's most recognized gardening and design experts, providing ideas and guidance through multiple media venues. He is the author of the Garden Home series of books published by Clarkson Potter/Random House, including Bringing the Garden Indoors: Container, Crafts and Bouquets for Every Room and the cookbook, Seasonal Recipes from the Garden, inspired by the abundance of food from his farm and a family of cooks. In 2014, Smith's television shows were successful at the Taste Awards with Smith returning to Little Rock with four Taste Awards. In 2015, Smith was inducted into the Taste Hall of Fame for his significant impact in the world of taste and broadcast entertainment. Garden Home won a 2017 Taste Award for “Best Green or Organic Program.” ==Life and work== Born in Little Rock, and raised in McMinnville, Tennessee, Smith is a fourth- generation nurseryman and horticulturalist. Inspired by a childhood spent on the farm raising and showing livestock and poultry, he has led a life of promoting good stewardship of the earth. In 2009, Smith founded the Heritage Poultry Conservancy, an organization dedicated to the preservation and support of all threatened breeds of domestic poultry. He attended Hendrix College and received a Rotary International Scholarship to study garden design and history at the University of Manchester in England, where he also studied English gardens that had been visited by John Adams and Thomas Jefferson in the 18th century. After returning to the United States, he entered the nursery and garden-design business with his family in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he focused on reviving interest in perennials. Smith also became a private tour guide to European gardens and started teaching gardening workshops, which then led to appearances on local television shows. In the half-hour episodes of P. Allen Smith Garden Home, Smith empowers people to discover their own style and to create beautiful indoor and outdoor living spaces in their own homes. His mission is to connect with people, cultivate health and mindfulness, and ultimately inspire others to live a more natural life. He shares lifestyle trends and stories of people who are making a positive impact in their communities. Some episodes are filmed at Smith's Arkansas Home, Moss Mountain Farm, near Little Rock, Arkansas. Smith has also appeared frequently on The Weather Channel, the CBS Early Show, the NBC \\"Today Show\\" and other national TV programs teaching viewers gardening and design techniques. He has also written several books on gardening and contributes pieces to numerous publications. Smith's design firm, P. Allen Smith & Associates, specializes in estate master planning, garden design and installation, with projects at public institutions, private corporations, and family estates. He is a former Board Member of the Royal Oak Foundation (the American partner of England's National Trust) and has contributed to preservation efforts at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and George Washington's Mount Vernon among other historic properties. He is a Certified Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society and is an Honorary Member of the Garden Club of America. Smith received the Garden Club of America's 'Medal of Honor' in 2006 at the GCA's 93rd Annual Meeting Awards Dinner in Denver, Colorado. ==Homes== Located in the historic Quapaw Quarter of Little Rock, Arkansas, the original Garden Home is a 1904 Colonial Revival cottage surrounded by a series of garden rooms designed by Smith. He purchased the house for one United States dollar and relocated it to a vacant lot. The bargain price was contingent on Allen receiving permission from the local historical commission to move the home from its original site and restore it elsewhere in the city. This garden was created to illustrate his 12 principles of design, the basis of his first book in the Garden Home series. Smith also built Moss Mountain Farm, also known as The Garden Home Retreat, which is located on the banks of the Arkansas River. It encompasses more than 500 acres of land dating back to 1840. The centerpiece is the cottage, built in the American Greek Revival style and constructed in an eco-friendly manner. Directly behind the cottage is the croquet lawn, which is framed by a summer kitchen and art studio. The surrounding garden includes a fountain garden that separates two wings of garden rooms filled with a mix of annuals, herbs, perennials, roses, shrubs and ornamental grasses. Beyond the flower gardens are orchards filled with heritage apple trees, stone fruit and blueberries, a one-acre vegetable garden, a bluebird trail, wildflower fields and a daffodil hill, which overflows with more than 300,000 daffodils blooming each spring. Various outbuildings, from barns to mobile chicken homes, are located throughout the grounds and surrounding pastures. Moss Mountain Farm is open to the public on select days and is available for hosting special events and weddings.A Beautiful Place, Moss Mountain Weddings (2013) and Moss Mountain Farm Weddings, P Allen Smith (2013) ==Career highlights== * Host of public television series, P.

Its Italianate building, perhaps constructed as a house, was built circa 1865, but it was converted into a restaurant by 1870. In its earliest years as a restaurant, it was run by John Neeb, who sold it to one of his employees in 1886. The new owner, Louis Mecklenburg, changed the name from \\"Mount Auburn Garden Restaurant\\" to \\"Mecklenburg's Garden,\\"Mecklenburg's Garden , University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, 2010.

Cincinnati Magazine 30.1 (1996): 127-129. During this time, Cincinnati was receiving massive numbers of German immigrants; with as much as 25% of the city's population being German-born, cultural institutions such as beer gardens were extremely popular.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 631. As the years passed, Mecklenburg's Garden prospered and expanded to accommodate more diners. Patrons historically made heavy use of the walled outdoor eating area, which was shaded by awnings and featured trellises covered by grapevines. During the 20th century, the Garden underwent a series of changes. Under Prohibition, the leading element of its income was outlawed, but it continued to operate covertly as a speakeasy as well as a legal restaurant: patrons knew whether they could safely purchase alcohol based on the position of a ship model on a counter. During the 1970s, the building underwent a structural restoration, around the time that it was owned by an ashram that, according to legend, made a failed attempt to convert the restaurant's kitchen staff. Although the restaurant closed multiple times during the late twentieth century, it reopened in 1996, and has continued in operation until the present time.History , Mecklenburg's Garden, n.d. Accessed 2014-10-23. In recognition of its place in local history, Mecklenburg's Garden was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The building housing the restaurant is a rectangular structure, built of brick on a stone foundation. Besides the historic outdoor garden, the interior features several small dining rooms and a central pub area to accommodate patrons. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Restaurant website Category:Houses completed in 1865 Category:Drinking establishments in Ohio Category:German beer culture Category:German restaurants Category:Italianate architecture in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:Restaurants in Cincinnati Category:Restaurants established in 1870 Category:German-American culture in Cincinnati Category:Cuisine of Cincinnati Category:Beer gardens in the United States Category:Drinking establishments on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Restaurants on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Beer in Ohio ","title":"Mecklenburg's Garden"},{"id":"12351524","text":"Calophyllum bicolor is a species of flowering plant in the family Calophyllaceae.

The Great Blue Heron Music Festival, or simply Blue Heron, as it is known, draws several thousand visitors throughout the course of three days. The Blue Heron presents over 30 musicians and bands between the three stages at the venue. Genres traditionally represented include bluegrass, Cajun, zydeco, African, reggae, Americana, old-time music, Irish music, and jam band. However, in recent years, the festival has featured many contemporary, national acts such as Rusted Root and The Avett Brothers. The first Blue Heron was held in 1992 Originally, the festival was conceived to be a small single-day gathering, featuring music from Donna The Buffalo. After the initial team meeting, the festival was expanded into a three-day event and continues in that format. The festival grounds, covering over 300 acres, contains three stages. A single main stage showcases the majority of the daytime and headlining music, while a 'dance tent' functions as a side stage during the festival. In 2010, an additional stage was built adjacent to the cafe in the woods. ==Artists that have performed== According to the Roster of Past Performers, the following artists have performed: *10,000 Maniacs *2 Cow Garage *Alison Pipitone *Allegany River Indian Dancers *Armor & Sturtevant *Atica *Baby Gramps *Balfa Toujours *Barton Barton Liuzzo & Ward *Barton Liuzzo & Ward *Barton-Johnson Band *Big Blow & The Bushwackers *Big Leg Emma *Bill Kirchen & Too Much Fun *Blue Sky Mission Club *Bobby Henrie & The Goners *Bollo Mah Kissy *Bombadil *Boojum Twist *Boy With A Fish *Bruce Peterson Blues Project *Bubba George Stringband *Buffalo Zydeco *Chanka Chank *Circus Of Dreams *Cold Lazarus *Colorblind James *Connell Bros Band *Cornerstone *Cowpoke Willis *Cri Du Bayou *Crow Greenspun *Dan Berggren *David Devine *Daybreak Radio *Djava *Doctor Zoot *Donna the Buffalo *Edna's Driveway *Eight Naked Buddhas *Entrain *Finn & The Sharks *Five Cubic Feet *Fred Eaglesmith / Flying Squirrels *Funktional Flow *Gandalp Murphy & The Slambovian *Gary Belloma & The Blue Bombers *Gokh-Bi System *Good Dog Bad Dog *Halley Devestern *Hank Roberts *Hillbilly Fun Park *Hillbilly Idol *Holly Figueroa *Hypnotic Clambake *Inner Orchestra *Inner Visions *Jamie Notarthomas *Jeff & Susie Goehring *Jenn Wertz & Lovechild *Jennie Stearns Band *Jim Donovan *Jimmyjohnnyjoe *Joe Thrift & Man Alive *John & Mary *John & Mary & The Valkyries *John Brown's Body *John Specker *Johnny Dowd Trio *J-San & The Analogue Sons *Kate Jacobs *Kathy Ziegler *Keith Lovett *Keith Secola & Wild Band Of Indians *Kelley And The Cowboys *Kilbrannan *Kinfolks *Lake Street Dive *Lejeune Jones *Leroy Thomas / Zydeco Roadrunners *Lightnin' Wells *Liz Berlin Band *Los Straitjackets *Mamma Tongue *Martin & Jessica Simpson *Mecca Bodega *Mercy Creek *Mojo Hand Blues Band *Moot Davis & The Cool Deal *New Nile Orchestra *New Paradigm *Oculus *One World Tribe *Organic Groove Farmers *Paso Fino *Peacefield *People of Earth *Pine Ridge *Plastic Nebraska *Ploughman's Lunch *Preston Frank *Psoas *Rasta Rafiki *Redheaded Stepchild *Ritual Space Travel Agency *River City Slim / Zydeco Hogs *Roy Carrier & The Night Rockers *Rusted Root *Sankai *Say Zuzu *Scott Carpenter & The Real Mccoys *Shoot The Moon *Sim Redmond Band *Slobberbone *Slo-Mo *Smackdab *Southern Culture on the Skids *Steel Pan Alley *Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys *Stewed Mulligan *Sunny Weather *Tara Nevins & Friends *The Avett Brothers *The Big Wu *The Bill Ward Band *The Blazers *The Blue Grasshoppers *The Blues Jumpers *The Bruce Peterson Blues Project *The Buddhahood *The Burns Sisters *The Buvas *The Campbell Brothers *The Carpetbaggers *The Chicken Chokers (Reunion) *The Creole Cowboys *The Crumbles *The Darlin' Clementines *The Dashboard Saviors *The Delaney Brothers *The Derbines *The Drummer & The Dancer National Tour *The Earthworms *The Elektra Kings *The Freewill Savages *The Funnest Game *The Goodfellas *The Groovemongers *The Heartbeats *The Hickory Project *The Hindu Cowboys *The Hix *The Homewreckers *The Horse Flies *The Knuckleheads *The Lonesome Sisters *The Low Road *The Macgillicuddies *The Mighty Wallop! *The Mollys *The Naked Apes *The New Alien String Band *The New Dylans *The Overtakers *The Red Hots *The Red Stick Ramblers *The Sim Redmond Band *The Steam Donkeys *The Talk To Me's *The Tarbox Ramblers *The Town Pants *The Woodshed Trio *The Woodticks *Tiger Maple Stringband *Tim O'Brien *Tin Roof *Ti-Ti-Chickapea *Tom Stahl *Tonemah *Tony Vacca *Trevor Macdonald & Silver Bird *Turku *Turtle Island Dream *Viva Quetzal *Vox Lumina *Wicked Natural Stringband *Willis Prudhomme W/ Redline Zydeco *Xalat *Y'all *Yankee Zydeco Company *Yves Jean Band *Zekuhl *Zeta Cauliflower *Zydeco Experiment ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Festival Map Category:Music festivals in New York (state) Category:Tourist attractions in Chautauqua County, New York ","title":"The Great Blue Heron Music Festival"},{"id":"12351546","text":"Ingendorf is a municipality in the district of Bitburg-Prüm, in Rhineland- Palatinate, western Germany. ==References== Category:Bitburg-Prüm ","title":"Ingendorf"},{"id":"12351547","text":"The Charles A.

Built in 1890 according to a design by Samuel Hannaford, it is a two-and-a-half story building constructed in the Gothic Revival style.Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. Accessed 2010-10-04. A brick and limestone structure with a slate roof,, Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-10-28. its facade is dominated by courses of ashlar, plus battlements at the top, and a prominent portico at the entrance.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 632. The floor plan is that of a rectangle, two bays wide and four bays deep; the right portion of the building features a gable, while the battlements appear primarily on the left side. Structurally, the house is supported by a post and lintel construction, with the exterior courses of stones forming the lintels as well as horizontal bands around the building. ==Charles Miller== Born in Portageville, NY in 1842, Charles Miller moved to Cincinnati and began an undertaking business there in 1866 after his service in the Union Army. By the last years of the 19th century, he had become prosperous enough to build the present house, which was constructed in 1890. He remained in business into the 20th century; in 1904, a city directory called him Cincinnati's oldest living funeral director. Miller chose a prestigious architect to design his house: the firm of Samuel Hannaford. A native of England, Hannaford began a Cincinnati architectural practice in the late 1850s; by the end of the 19th century, he had developed a strong reputation for his designs for the city's social and political leaders, due largely to his attention to detail and his willingness to design buildings in a wide range of architectural styles. Four other Hannaford-designed houses built in Cincinnati between 1890 and 1892 are still standing; like the Miller house, all of them feature courses of ashlar on the facade, as do several Hannaford houses built at other times. Several of these early 1890s houses are built in an eclectic architectural style; among them is the Miller House, which features an eclectic form of the Victorian style. ==Recognition== In 1980, the Charles A. Miller House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it qualified for inclusion due to its well-preserved historic architecture. Nearly 40 other properties in Cincinnati and other parts of Hamilton County, including 14 other houses, were added to the Register at the same time as part of a multiple property submission of buildings designed by Samuel Hannaford and/or his sons. The Miller House is significantly newer than some of the houses included in this group, for the oldest of Hannaford's residential designs in the city was constructed in 1862. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1890 Category:Houses in Cincinnati Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:Victorian architecture in Ohio Category:1890s architecture in the United States ","title":"Charles A.

One of the oldest houses in the area, it has been named a historic site. When Columbia was founded in 1788 as Hamilton County's first settlement, the pioneers spread out as far upriver as today's Anderson Township. Land in the township, including the location of the Miller–Leuser House, was surveyed five years later as part of a general survey of the Virginia Military District. In 1796, explorer Nathaniel Massie purchased the site of the present house and quickly devised it to Ichabod Miller; he is believed to have constructed the house by the end of the year, and he retained ownership until selling it in 1836. The cabin remained in residential use until 1971, when it was bought by the Anderson Township Historical Society; as one of the oldest buildings in southwestern Ohio, and as a typical component of the pioneer built environment, locals deemed it a highly significant part of their history.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 632-633. In building his house, Ichabod Miller employed a mix of logs: some were hand-hewn, while others retained their original round shape, and all are notched to enable them to fit together at the corners. The entire building is one and one half stories tall. In 1974, the Miller–Leuser Log House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, one of more than three hundred such locations in Hamilton County. It qualified for inclusion primarily because of its architecture, rather than because of its place in local history. The house is one of twelve National Register locations in Anderson Township, along with one house in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Cincinnati, three sites in the village of Newtown, and seven other places in the unincorporated portions of the township. ==References== Category:Log cabins in the United States Category:Houses in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Former houses in Ohio Category:Houses completed in 1796 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Log buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:1796 establishments in the Northwest Territory ","title":"Miller–Leuser Log House"},{"id":"12351567","text":"Calophyllum collinum is a species of flowering plant in the Calophyllaceae family.

After World War II, it briefly reverted to being named \\"Stadion der Stadt Hannover\\", before changing to its current title.

They remained here until 1959, when the club eventually left to move to the brand new Niedersachsenstadion. However, the club's youth and amateur sides continue to play here today. In 1931 and 1937, the German national team played (and won) two internationals here against Denmark (4-2) and Belgium (1-0). In 2000 the recently refurbished stadium hosted the centenary celebrations of the German Rugby Federation, including the Centenary Match between a German Rugby Federation selection and the famous British Barbarians (19-47).

However, this is not a valid emendation. ==Species== There are currently six recognized species in this genus: * Sisor barakensis Vishwanath & Darshan, 2005 * Sisor chennuah Ng & Lahkar, 2003 * Sisor pakistanicus Javed & Mirza, 2011Javed, M.N. & Mirza, M.R.

Biologia (Pakistan), 57 (1&2): 15-21. * Sisor rabdophorus Hamilton, 1822 * Sisor rheophilus Ng, 2003 * Sisor torosus Ng, 2003 ==Distribution and habitat== Sisor species are distributed in the Ganges and Brahmaputra drainages in India. S. barakensis originates from the Barak River of the Brahmaputra drainage in India. S. chennuah inhabits the Brahmaputra drainage in Assam State, India. S. rabdophorus originates from the Ganges drainage, West Bengal States, India. S. rheophilus originates from the Ganges drainage, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh States, India. S. torosus lives in the Ganges drainage, Bihar and Delhi States, India. The identities of Sisor specimens from the Indus River, Rohini River at Madhopur, and Nepal have not yet been confirmed. S. rheophilus has been found in fast-moving rivers with sandy bottoms. S. rabdophorus also inhabits streams with sandy bottoms and strong currents. ==Description== Illustration Sisor is distinguished from all other erethistids and sisorids by the presence of a series of bony plates extending from the dorsal fin to the base of the caudal fin and a spine in adipose fin. Also, the uppermost caudal-fin ray is more than half length of body, the branchiostegal membranes are broadly fused to isthmus, the outer and inner mental barbels are widely separated with the origin of outer barbels anterior to origin of inner barbels, the lower jaw teeth are minute, dentition essentially consisting of roughened plate, large serrations on the anterior margin of the pectoral spine (also serrated posteriorly), a well-developed maxillary barbel membrane, and palatal teeth absent. The head is moderately narrow and strongly depressed. The body is extremely narrow and strongly depressed. The eyes are small, dorsolaterally located, and under the skin (subcutaneous). The maxillary barbels do not extending beyond the head. The dorsal fin spine is serrate anteriorly and smooth posteriorly. S. chennua, S. rheophilus, and S. torosus grow to about SL. S. rabdophorus attains a length of about SL. ==References== Category:Sisoridae Category:Fish of South Asia Category:Fish of India Category:Fauna of Pakistan Category:Freshwater fish genera Category:Catfish genera Category:Taxa named by Francis Buchanan- Hamilton ","title":"Sisor"},{"id":"12351674","text":"Calophyllum obscurum is a species of flowering plant in the Calophyllaceae family.

Mitchell House is a historic residence in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Built of stone throughout, this large house was designed by prominent Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford. Converted into a school, the house has been named a historic site. ==History== Robert Mitchell was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States in 1824. After founding a furniture company in Cincinnati in 1836, he built his business into a prosperous firm, and by the 1890s, he was wealthy enough to build the present house as a gift for his son Richard.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 633-634. Constructed in 1892, the house was home to the Mitchell family for forty years. When the family left, the building was acquired by St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, which converted it into premises for the parish school. The parish remained in the former house into the 1970s. Since that time, the Mitchell House has become the location of a different school, The New School Montessori. Richard Mitchell employed Samuel Hannaford as the architect for the house. Popular among wealthy Gilded Age Cincinnatians, Hannaford was the most significant of the city's nineteenth-century architects.Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. He was willing to employ numerous architectural styles, producing buildings in such styles as the Romanesque Revival, the Queen Anne, and the Neo-Renaissance. Other Hannaford structures combined elements of different styles in an eclectic manner, including the Mitchell House. Mitchell's residence was one of his later works, built just five years before the end of his decades-long career. ==Architecture== Two and a half stories tall, the Mitchell House is built of stone throughout, with large ashlar blocks employed for the walls. Limestone walls rest on a stone foundation, and the roof is slate., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-03-26. Among the leading components of the design are a prominent porch and turret, located at the center of the facade and on one corner of the facade respectively. Although the dormer- pierced turret roof rises to a conical peak, other parts of the house are capped by gabled roofs; the gables themselves form a leading component of the design. Below one of the gables, the porch is distinguished by grand arches and a stone balustrade surrounding the roof. ==Preservation== In 1980, the Richard H. Mitchell House was among dozens of Hannaford-designed buildings in Hamilton County listed together on the National Register of Historic Places as a multiple property submission. Like most of the other buildings in the group, the Mitchell House qualified for the Register because of its well-preserved historic architecture. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1892 Category:Former houses in Ohio Category:Houses in Cincinnati Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Defunct Catholic schools in the United States Category:Montessori schools in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:Private schools in Cincinnati ","title":"Richard H.

Bundesliga 6 34 13 9 12 54 49 48 First round align=leftMarvin Ducksch 15 } ==Notes== A. The Südkreisliga was a localised division within the Northern German system. The winners would have to compete against other North German league winners to determine the North German representative at the national championship. Despite their 4 local league titles, Hannover 96 never managed to make it through to the national championship in this period. B. Prior to the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963–64, the regional champions would meet in a championship tournament to crown the national champions. Hannover 96 lost out in these in the following seasons: 1934–35, 1939–40, 1940–41, 1948–49; their two victories in 1937–38 (4–3 v. FC Schalke 04) and 1953–54 (5–1 v. 1. FC Kaiserslautern) made them German champions. C. Early in the 1948–49 season, Hannover 96 won an appeal against their relegation of the previous season, as Holstein Kiel, who had narrowly survived at their expense, had fielded an illegal player. The club were awarded their place back in the top flight for the next season. Upon this, Hannover 96 immediately ended their league campaign (after 3 games completed) for 1948–49 and only played friendlies for the remainder of the season. D. Hannover 96's application to enter the Bundesliga in its inaugural year of 1963–64 was turned down, and so they were moved to the newly created Regionalliga Nord, a second tier division. E. Their promotion to the Bundesliga the following season was via a playoff league involving teams from all 6 areas of the Regionalliga. F. For the 1991–92 season, the 2. Bundesliga was split into north and south divisions as it integrated the new clubs from the former East Germany. G. Promotion from the modern Regionalliga Nord relied upon winning a playoff against the Regionalliga Nordost champions. In 1996–97, Hannover 96 lost in this (1–3 v. Energie Cottbus) and thus remained in the Regionalliga, but in 1997–98 they were victorious (2–2 v. Tennis Borussia Berlin - 3–1 on penalties) and so gained promotion. H. Entry into the DFB-Pokal only became automatic for all league clubs with the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1963–64. In the period from the foundation of the cup in 1953 until this point, only the winners of the regional cup competitions, along with the national league champions and national amateur champions were entered. Hannover 96's appearance in 1954–55 was via their league championship success in the previous season. I. Seasons prior to 1995–96 are using the old points system of 2 points for a win; from 1995–96 onward is the present system with 3 points for a win. ==External links== *Hannover 96 at worldfootball.net Seasons Category:German football club statistics Category:German football club seasons ","title":"List of Hannover 96 seasons"},{"id":"12351854","text":"Calophyllum waliense is a species of flowering plant in the Calophyllaceae family.

Built in 1800, they were constructed as homes for some of the city's founding families, who settled in the area in the spring of 1795 after travelling from Montgomery in eastern New York in the aftermath of the signing of the Treaty of Greenville. Although one house is brick and the other wood, they are otherwise very similar; both have been called fine examples of a style often seen in the northeastern United States but virtually never in southwestern Ohio.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 634. East Salt Box House The city of Montgomery was platted along the east-west Cooper Road, but aside from the Saltbox Houses, few historic buildings remain along this street. After Columbus became the state capital, the present Montgomery Road, the old north-south street, became much more heavily travelled, and later development was concentrated along this road. As a result, few other buildings remain from the original plat of the community. In 1987, the houses were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places.

Moore House is a historic residence in the city of Wyoming, Ohio, United States. Built in 1910 and home for a short time to a leading oilman, it has been designated a historic site. ==Charles Moore== Owner and president of the Moore Oil Company, Charles H. Moore was one of many wealthy men who lived in Wyoming and commuted to high-placed jobs in Cincinnati's economy. He only inhabited the house a short time before dying in 1911; following his death, it was sold to Ray and Mary Dollings, who resided on the property until 1937.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 634-635. ==Historic context== Good transportation is a leading reason for Wyoming's prosperity. The city lies near the old pre-statehood road that connected Cincinnati with locations farther north, such as Fort Hamilton and Fallen Timbers. Curves in the road were cut off in 1806, forming a new road that is today followed by Springfield Pike through central Wyoming. Improvements in the 1830s only enhanced its importance.McCauley, Jennifer. '. National Park Service, 1985-08-16. Accessed 2011-02-26. By this time, another mode of transportation had become significant: the Miami and Erie Canal was built a short distance to the east in 1828, and the village of Lockland grew up along its side. Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad on the border between Lockland and Wyoming. Because of Wyoming's proximity to the industry of Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses. Most such houses were built in the Wyoming Hills area, west of Springfield Pike; growth in this area continued until the coming of the Great Depression. ==Architecture== Built in 1910 and designed by an unknown person, the Moore House is a weatherboarded building of two and a half stories resting atop a stone foundation. Brick details the structure, which is topped with a hip roof pierced with dormer windows on multiple sides, covered with slates, and supported with a cornice of brackets. A wrap-around porch with Ionic columns forms much of the facade, sheltering the first floor and providing support to the second. Were the porch removed, an overhang would be present on the right side of the house, as seen from the street., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-27. Underneath the porch, the first floor includes a prominent bay window to the right of the main entrance, which sits in the center of the facade. The overall shape of the house makes it typical of the American Foursquare style; this style was common in Wyoming's Village neighborhood, which was home to residents of more typical income than the wealthy denizens of the Wyoming Hills. ==Historic site== In 1979, a local historic preservation group began a citywide survey to identify Wyoming's historic buildings, and this effort culminated with a multiple property submission of eighteen houses, the Wyoming Presbyterian Church, and one historic district (the Village) to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. As part of this grouping, the Charles H. Moore House was listed on the Register in the following year, qualifying both because of its important architecture and because of its prominent original resident. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1910 Category:American Foursquare architecture Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Ohio Category:Houses in Wyoming, Ohio Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Wooden houses in the United States ","title":"Charles H.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and after that served in the Soviet Navy as T-278. The Soviets converted her into a naval trawler in 1948 and renamed her Uragan. ==Construction and commissioning== Nucleus was laid down at Chickasaw, Alabama, by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation on 7 September 1942, launched on 26 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. V. Ludwig, and commissioned on 11 February 1944 with Lieutenant D. H. Elliot in command. ==Service history== U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943-1945 Following shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, Nucleus served briefly as an escort vessel to the Caribbean, then on 20 April 1944 proceeded to Boston. From Boston, she escorted a convoy to Naval Station Argentia in the Dominion of Newfoundland, arriving there on 6 May 1944. After another escort run between Boston and Argentia, she took up meteorological information collection duties in the North Atlantic Ocean. Between 10 and 24 June 1944 a platform deck for launching radiosonde gear and weather balloons was added to her silhouette to make her more effective as a weather ship. Relieved of weather duties by her sister ship on 7 October 1944, Nucleus returned to Boston, then steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there on 25 November 1944. During December 1944 Nucleus swept mines and conducted antisubmarine warfare patrols off the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. In January 1945 she conducted another Caribbean escort run, and on 2 February 1945 she departed Norfolk, escorting the gasoline (petrol) tanker to Navassa Island. Detached on 8 February 1945, she continued on to the Panama Canal Zone and transited the Panama Canal for duty in the Pacific. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Nucleus arrived at Cold Bay on 3 April 1945 to begin familiarization training of her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. Soviet Navy, 1945-1960 Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Method was decommissioned on 21 May 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-278 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she entered service with the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet on 17 June 1945. After the Soviet Union entered the war against Japan on 8 August 1945, T-278 took part in the Soviet amphibious landings at Chongjin, Korea, on 18 August 1945 and at Maoka in the Japanese province of Karafuto on southern Sakhalin Island on 20 August 1945. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Nucleus to the United States, instead converting her into a naval trawler in 1948 and renaming her Uragan. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-268 on 7 February 1955. ==Disposal== The ship was scrapped in 1960. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Nucleus on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983. ==Awards== The Soviet Union awarded T-278 the Guards rank and ensign on 26 August 1945 for her service during the August 1945 Soviet offensive against the Japanese. == References == * * Category:Admirable-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in Chickasaw, Alabama Category:1943 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Admirable-class minesweepers of the Soviet Navy Category:World War II minesweepers of the Soviet Union Category:Cold War minesweepers of the Soviet Union Category:Trawlers of the Soviet Navy Category:Cold War patrol vessels of the Soviet Union Category:Weather ships Category:Ships transferred under Project Hula ","title":"USS Nucleus (AM-268)"},{"id":"12351903","text":"The Bernard H.

One of the area's first houses designed by master architect Samuel Hannaford, the elaborate brick house was home to the owner of a prominent food-processing firm, and it has been named a historic site. Born in 1838, Thomas Morrison left his native County Antrim in 1860, where he quickly found employment with Morrison and Cardukes, one of Cincinnati's numerous pork packing firms. After working for the company for nearly forty years, he became the owner in 1897, and under his leadership the company outgrew nearly all of its competitors and became one of the first American meat packing firms to export its products to the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. Morrison was married to the daughter of William Procter, co-founder of Procter & Gamble.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 635-636. One of Samuel Hannaford's earlier houses in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the Morrison House was constructed in 1873 and saw the last details added in 1875; it postdated Hannaford's own residence by approximately ten years, but the architect was still comparatively little known when the Morrison House was completed.Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. However, following his Music Hall of Music Hall in the late 1870s, Hannaford became one of Cincinnati's most prominent architects; by the end of the century, the Morrison House was one of several Hannaford designs in the neighborhood of Clifton, and numerous grand Hannaford houses could be found throughout other wealthy neighborhoods such as Walnut Hills and Avondale. Two and a half stories tall, the Morrison House is a brick building with a slate roof and additional elements of wood and stone. The center of the facade includes a three-story tower projecting forward from the rest of the building, while large dormer windows are placed in the roof on either side of the tower.

Accessed 2014-01-02. while the center features a large sandstone archway with Corinthian columns. These elements combine to give it an Italianate appearance, although with influence from other styles; this reflects Hannaford's employment of numerous architectural styles through his career. In 1973, the Morrison House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its architecture. Seven years later, it was included in a multiple property submission of dozens of Hannaford-designed buildings in Hamilton County, one of few in the grouping that were already on the Register. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Imagery and documentation from the University of Cincinnati Category:Houses completed in 1873 Category:Houses in Cincinnati Category:Italianate architecture in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati ","title":"Morrison House (Cincinnati, Ohio)"},{"id":"12351926","text":"Church St. Cosmas und Damian Old rectory and adjacent parish hall Koxhausen is a municipality in the district of Bitburg-Prüm, in Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Site of the Koxhausen fire brigade with a history and many photos of Koxhausen Category:Bitburg-Prüm ","title":"Koxhausen"},{"id":"12351928","text":"Clusia cupulata is a species of flowering plant in the family Clusiaceae.

The aircraft first flew in July 1924; it performed well but because it did not have a dual-ignition system it was refused a certificate of airworthiness. As it would have taken at least ten hours of flight testing to certify it with a single-ignition system, de Havilland decided to re-engine the aircraft instead. The aircraft was fitted with an ADC Airdisco Air-cooled V8 piston engine, which considerably improved performance but was no longer cheap to operate. As a result, only three aircraft were built.

She has worked on more than 30 movies in such roles as production designer, set decorator and set designer, and has four Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction for L.A. Confidential, Pleasantville, Seabiscuit and The Good Shepherd. Many of her film sets represented different time periods within the 20th century, including the 1930s (Seabiscuit), the 1950s (L.A. Confidential and Pleasantville), and from the 1960s (The Big Easy, The Bridges of Madison County and Catch Me If You Can). ==Biography== Early life Jeannie Oppewall was born on November 28, 1946 and was raised in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, with a Calvinist upbringing. Her father was a tool and die maker Garrett Oppewall and her mother was Eva Boutiler. According to The New York Times, Oppewall was determined to be \\"the family intellectual.\\" Oppewall attended and graduated from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she met future husband, Paul Schrader, who would go on to become a film director and screenwriter. She then studied medieval history at Bryn Mawr College in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. There she discovered the furniture of designers and filmmakers Charles and Ray Eames, which inspired her to switch her focus to modern design. Oppewall said of the Eames designs, \\"I was so attracted by the contemporary feeling, the shapely sexy lines: totally different from the Sears, Roebuck middle-class stuff I'd grown up with. I looked at it and said, 'This is me.'\\" Oppewall obtained her master's degree from Bryn Mawr in 1969 and moved to Los Angeles, California. At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, \\"I can teach you how to draw, I cannot teach you how to think or see. If you can think and you can see, you can stay.\\" Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, \\"saw something in me I didn't know was there.\\" By the end of her time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits. Eames made more than 100 small personal and educational films in that time and, as a result of her exposure to them, Oppewall said she got into the film business \\"by accident.\\" Film career Oppewall began her film career helping Paul Schrader on his 1979 film Hardcore, for which she was credited as a \\"project consultant.\\" Oppewall and Schrader were divorced sometime after the film's release. She began her career as a set and production designer in the early 1980s, with such films as the 1981 Brian De Palma thriller Blow Out. Oppewall was responsible for overseeing the finding of locations for her films and the design and construction of sets and interiors; according to a profile in The New York Times, she was \\"responsible for everything an actor walks in front of, sits on, drives through or picks up.\\" One of her earlier movies was Tender Mercies, a 1983 film about an alcoholic country singer played by Robert Duvall. Director Bruce Beresford praised Oppewall as \\"absolutely brilliant,\\" especially for her attention to very small details, \\"going from the curtains to the color of the quilts on the floors.\\" A large portion of the movie was filmed in the home of Duvall's character, which Beresford created from an old house that had been sitting abandoned by a highway in Waxahachie, Texas, where the majority of the movie was filmed. Oppewall said of her career, \\"What I do for a living is not dissimilar from what an actor does. I have a different set of tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you to try on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience.\\" Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, \\"Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet she has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies.\\" Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: \\"While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her.\\" Part of the set for Seabiscuit was set in Tijuana during the Prohibition era, Oppewall and her staff consulting vintage postcards in order to create the set; she said this part of the film was especially difficult to research because, \\"A Tijuana Historical Society didn't exactly exist back then.\\" She also built a replica of the ranch owned by Charles S. Howard, the owner of the racehorse Seabiscuit, out of fir planks. Actor Jeff Bridges, who played Howard, was so impressed with the set that he made an unsuccessful attempt to buy it and have it shipped to his property in Montana, despite Oppewall's assurances that it was just a set and was not built to last. In a similar episode, the owners of the Santa Anita racetrack were so impressed with her design for a tote board that they wanted to keep it. When Oppewall was assigned art director for the 2006 spy film The Good Shepherd, it took her a week to organize the number of set locations due to the large amounts of settings in the script, which included Cuba, Guatemala, Léopoldville, London, Moscow, New York and New Haven, Connecticut, among other places. Although the vast majority of the movie was filmed in New York, the only scenes that are actually set in New York take place in a house in Far Rockaway, Queens. As a result, many sets had to be constructed under Oppewall's direction, including a Skull and Bones headquarters and the Berlin set, which was built on the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Oppewall built sets based on Skull and Bones, Central Intelligence Agency and other clandestine organizations after she consulted with a former CIA operative and researched books of interviews with spy agency insiders. Since the lead character played by Matt Damon originally aspired to be a poet, Oppewall incorporated many visual poetic symbols into the film, including a large number of mirrors to represent the duplicity of the CIA, full rigged ships as symbols of the state and eagle symbols, which were used in ironic situations such as suspect interrogations. she is a member of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She is also a world-traveled amateur lepidopterist. , she also serves on the Art Directors Guild's education\\"Education Committee.\\" Art Directors Guild.

In 2000, Oppewall tore down the bungalow and built a larger modern house in the style of Charles and Ray Eames because she \\"did not want my house to conflict with my (Eames-designed) furniture,\\" which she bought while working for the Eameses. ==Awards and nominations== Oppewall has been nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Art Direction for L.A.

St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. It is believed to have been built by the Adena culture. The mound is one of the few remnants of what was once a large complex of prehistoric earthworks and other archaeological sites. While multiple village sites are still in existence around Newtown, including the Perin Village Site just to the northwest, many of the earthworks have been destroyed. Because of its location in a cemetery, the Odd Fellows' Cemetery Mound has been spared destruction; although a few graves have been dug around the mound, there has been no significant damage done as a result. A smaller mound, known as the \\"Odd Fellows' Cemetery Mound 2,\\" is located within the same cemetery; it is only a small fraction of the larger mound's size. This mound has been damaged by the digging of six graves into its side; however, no artifacts are known to have been found during the interment process. For many years, the Odd Fellows' Cemetery Mound has been a landmark in the community. In 1943, a survey of Newtown performed by the Federal Writers' Project highlighted it and noted that it was \\"the only mound distinctly visible\\" in the vicinity of the village. Thirty years later, the mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its potential to become an archaeological site. Four years later, the nearby Perin Village Site was granted a similar status. ==See also== *Independent Order of Odd Fellows ==ReferencesExternal links== * from the Ohio Historical Society Category:Adena culture Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Cemeteries in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Protected areas of Hamilton County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:Mounds in Ohio ","title":"Odd Fellows' Cemetery Mound"},{"id":"12352100","text":"Garcinia cadelliana is a critically endangered species of small tree in the family Clusiaceae found only on the South Andaman Island of India. ==References== Category:Flora of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands cadelliana Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Garcinia cadelliana"},{"id":"12352109","text":"Garcinia cantleyana is a species of flowering plant in the family Clusiaceae.

Built in the 1840s to serve a tiny college town community, it has experienced extensive alterations, but enough of its original qualities remain that it was named a historic site in the 1970s. Nehemiah Tunis bought land north of Cincinnati from John Cleves Symmes in 1796; although the land was long used for agriculture, a settlement grew up in the 19th century on part of the tract after two colleges were established: the precursor to the Ohio Military Institute, in 1833, and the Ohio Female College, in 1852. Once railroad service and public transportation arrived in the 1850s and 1860s, the community flourished, and it incorporated as \\"College Hill\\" in 1866. The community remained independent for approximately fifty years before being annexed into Cincinnati in pieces, beginning in 1911 and concluding in 1923. Numerous civic institutions existed during College Hill's time as a separate village,Cincinnati: A Guide to the Queen City and Its Neighbors. American Guide Series. Cincinnati: Wiesen-Hart, 1943. including a post office. The post office was actually older than most other improvements, having been built in 1840, while most other civic improvements were constructed after incorporation. It was not the first building to house postal operations in the community, as federal officials formally established the post office in September 1837 under the name of \\"Pleasant Hill, Ohio\\". Although it closed in 1838, operations were restored in 1842. Its name was changed to \\"Careys Academy, Ohio\\" two weeks after its restoration, and it became \\"College Hill, Ohio\\" in 1849. Service was discontinued in August 1892, when it became a station of the Cincinnati post office. When the post office was constructed in 1840, it was a frame single-story structure; this early building has since been expanded, as a second story is now present; the date of construction for the second story is unknown.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 641-642. The basic form is that of a rectangle with doors and larger windows on the front, while the side possesses lesser fenestration. Two sections deviate from the basic plan: a rear addition that projects slightly to the side, and a two-story front porch with a door and balcony on the second floor. The walls are weatherboarded, and the building sits on a stone foundation., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-01-05. Into the late twentieth century, the eaves of the building's flat roof, which projects in front of the house over the front porch, ended in a cornice with bracketing. The old porch featured elaborately worked wooden columns on the first floor and simple posts on the second, while the second floor was guarded with a railing of panels. The post office has not retained its original commercial function, having instead been converted into a single-family residence. In 1976, the Old College Hill Post Office was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its well-preserved historic architecture; although modified, it is one of College Hill's oldest buildings. It is one of two buildings from the old village of College Hill to be listed on the National Register, along with the College Hill Town Hall. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Documentation from the University of Cincinnati Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1840 Category:Former post office buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cincinnati Category:Post office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio ","title":"Old College Hill Post Office"},{"id":"12352154","text":"Lasel is a municipality in the district of Bitburg-Prüm, in Rhineland- Palatinate, western Germany. ==References== Category:Bitburg-Prüm ","title":"Lasel"},{"id":"12352155","text":"Garcinia epunctata is a tall tropical rainforest tree in the family Clusiaceae.

Built in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, they were designated a historic site in the 1970s because of their distinctive architecture. As one of Green Township's first settlers, farmer William Bell was able to amass a large estate; by the 1840s, he owned much land along present-day Colerain Avenue. Near the end of his life, he arranged for the construction of two barns in the Carpenter Gothic style. His choice of architectural style was highly unusual; Gothic Revival elements as found on these two barns are unknown at any other farm in southwestern Ohio. Both were built with an extremely vertical emphasis: a sharply pitched roof increased their height, and the impression of verticality was reinforced by elements such as vertical batten, a cupola with a spire, and the tall pointed windows and doors. These windows and doors, along with other elements such as brackets under the eaves, gave the barns an unusually pure Gothic Revival feel.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places.

A precise date for the barns' construction has been debated. Research has strongly suggested that the barns were constructed before Bell's death in 1847, it has been proven that he arranged for their construction, and they were clearly built after 1840 and before 1850, but no other details are known. Despite the lack of detailed information about their construction, the barns were clearly seen as architecturally significant by the 1970s. In 1976, they were recognized by their placement on the National Register of Historic Places; their architecture had been deemed to be important on a statewide level.

Located at an elevation of more than 2,400 meters in the foothills of the Andes and in the middle of the Atacama Desert, it has a population of approximately 7,000 inhabitants. At its peak, El Salvador once had a population of 24,000 inhabitants. ==Development and economy== El Salvador's economy is entirely based on copper mining. The Atacameños extracted copper from this area for more than a thousand years. Nevertheless, it was American explorations in the 1950s that revealed the presence of ore that could be exploited in an industrial scale. Anaconda Copper Mining Company was concerned about declining reserves in its Potrerillos mine and it sent prospectors in search of a new Chilean ore body in 1951. Working under the auspices Anaconda's Andes Mining subsidiary, the mineralization was discovered in 1954 and mapped in 1955.Frank Trask, III, The History of Indio Muerto - a Copper Mine in Chile As a remote discovery, Anaconda had to build El Salvador as a self-contained and self-sustaining town. It was complete with housing, schools, stores, water and electrical plants and a railway. The mine opened in 1959. The architect in charge of designing the city was Raymond Olson, who worked at the Anaconda headquarters in New York City. The town was designed in the shape of a Roman helmet. Legend has it that an executive of Anaconda Mining Company travelled to the proposed town site with his son. The boy had with him his beloved toy; a Roman helmet, which he lost in the desert. Years later once the city was built he was flown over the town and his father said “Remember the toy helmet you lost as a young boy, look down son there it is Key dates for the foundation of El Salvador, are: 23 April 1959, on this date the first load of ore was crushed, in less than three months on 2 July, the first bar of Copper arrived in New York. The town itself was inaugurated on 28 November 1959. In 1971, after nationalization of copper under the government of Salvador Allende, Codelco Chile took over operation of the El Salvador mine. In 2004, according to official numbers, a total of 74,874 tons metric of fine copper were produced, employing 1,727 people. Nevertheless, since 2001, and in spite of sustained increases in the international price of copper, the mine has experienced losses of more than 3.4 million dollars. In addition, a study by the Australian consultant Goldberg, determined that only 243 million tons of copper remain in the mine, which assures mineral for only a few years. On July 29, 2005 Codelco announced the planned closure of the mine beginning in 2008. Beginning in that year oxide production will cease, and later, sulfide production from the underground mine. It was expected that the townsite would be closed in the 2011, however it is still inhabited as of 2020, with a currently indefinite closure date. The Salvador Solar Park is located approximately 5 kilometres south of El Salvador. This 70 MW facility was commissioned in November 2014. ==Sports== El Salvador is represented by Cobresal in the Chilean Football League. Its stadium, Copper Stadium, was inaugurated in 1980. After expansion to accommodate spectators when Cobresal successfully competed in the Chilean League's Premier B finals in 1983, it had a total capacity of 20,752 spectators, that is to say, almost three times the population of the town. ==See also== *El Salvador mine ==External links== * Photos (2004) ==References== Category:Communes of Chile Category:Mining communities in Chile Category:Populated places in Chañaral Province Category:Anaconda Copper ","title":"El Salvador, Chile"},{"id":"12352174","text":"Garcinia hendersoniana is a species of flowering plant in the family Clusiaceae.

It is found in Benin, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Mali , Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. The fruit, seeds, nuts and bark of the plant have been used for centuries in folk medicine to treat ailments from coughs to fever. According to a report from the Center For International Forestry Research, Garcinia kola trade is still important to the indigenous communities and villages in Nigeria. ==Traditional medicine== Garcinia kola is traditionally used by African folk healers who believe that it has purgative, antiparasitic, and antimicrobial properties.Maurice Iwu, Angela R. Duncan, and Chris O. Okunji, New Antimicrobials of Plant Origin p. 457–462. 1999, ASHS Press, Alexandria, VA The seeds are used for liver disorders, bronchitis, throat infections, colic, head or chest colds, and cough. It is also used as a chewing stick. == Barriers to cultivation == Despite the socio-economic importance of Garcinia kola, cultivation of the species is limited. Factors that have discouraged farmers from growing Garcinia kola include difficulties in germination that reduces seedling availability. Most productive trees were left in the wild when farmers cut plots out of the forest.Adebisi, 2004 Researchers have studied the germination problems of G. kola seeds and suggested various means of breaking its dormancy.Gyimah, 2000 Anegbeh et al., 2006 Kanmegne and Ndoumou, 2007 Oboho and Urughu, 2010 Oboho and Ogana, 2011 However, there is still a need to investigate simple and practicable methods that farmers could easily adopt with low technological input. G. kola seeds have both seed coat dormancy and physiological dormancy probably imposed by the chemicals in the seed.Oboho and Urughu 2010 Seed coat dormancy of Garcinia kola can be reduced by removing the seed coat before sowing, while physiological dormancy can be reduced by soaking in water for 72 hours.Yakubu et al., 2014 Removal of the seed coat, soaking in water for 72 hours, placing inside air-tight transparent polythene bags and sprinkling water on the seeds when needed for constant moisture gives an early germination period of two weeks, while the combination of freshly harvested seeds, pierced minimally and tied in black nylon reduces the germination period to between five and seven days as the piercing or nicking procedure makes for quick availability of water and oxygen to the seed embryo.Okonkwo, H.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 644. ==Historic context== Good transportation is a leading reason for Wyoming's prosperity. The city lies near the old pre-statehood road that connected Cincinnati with locations farther north, such as Fort Hamilton and Fallen Timbers. Curves in the road were cut off in 1806, forming a new road that is today followed by Springfield Pike through central Wyoming. Improvements in the 1830s only enhanced its importance.McCauley, Jennifer. '. National Park Service, 1985-08-16. Accessed 2011-02-26. By this time, another mode of transportation had become significant: the Miami and Erie Canal was built a short distance to the east in 1828, and the village of Lockland grew up along its side. Railroads reached the city in 1851 with the construction of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad on the border between Lockland and Wyoming. Because of Wyoming's proximity to the industry of Lockland, its easy transportation to the booming city of Cincinnati, and its pleasant scenery, many wealthy industrialists purchased local farms and built grand country houses. Most such houses were built in the Wyoming Hills area, west of Springfield Pike; growth in this area continued until the coming of the Great Depression. William Pabodie was himself not a businessman; a faculty member for Cincinnati Public Schools, he taught mathematics at the old Woodward High School in Over-the-Rhine for many years. His house is one of at least seven significant Wyoming residences with clear connections to the history of Cincinnati. ==Historic site== In 1979, a local historic preservation group began a citywide survey to identify Wyoming's historic buildings, and this effort culminated with a multiple property submission of eighteen houses, the Wyoming Presbyterian Church, and one historic district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Beams under bending loads or compression invite stiffening to stop buckling or collapse while fulfilling desired functions, purposes, and benefits. == Bookbinding == In bookbinding, stiffening is a process whereby paperback books are reinforced for use in libraries, without change to their fundamental binding structure. It is in use at several academic libraries in the United States, including those at Cornell University and Johns Hopkins University. During the stiffening process, a cloth or Tyvek strip is glued down on the inside joints of a paperback to reinforce the attachment of the book's covers. A thin but stiff board is then glued to the inside of both the front and back cover of the book, and the entire book is trimmed slightly on the head, tail, and fore edge, often with an electric guillotine. Stiffening provides an in-house, inexpensive alternative to commercial library binding for paperbacks. While it does not involve (re-)sewing a book as in a library binding, stiffening does significantly prolong the usable life of a paperback, and allows paperbacks to stand upright on library shelves. The stiffening process was invented in 1974 by John Dean, who was Head of Preservation at Johns Hopkins at the time. == References  Citations == Category:Mechanics Category:Bookbinding ","title":"Stiffening"},{"id":"12352235","text":"Garcinia minutiflora is a species of flowering plant in the family Clusiaceae.

National and international bodies assign different frequencies for specific uses, and in most cases license the rights to broadcast over these frequencies. This frequency allocation process creates a bandplan, which for technical reasons assigns white space between used radio bands or channels to avoid interference. In this case, while the frequencies are unused, they have been specifically assigned for a purpose, such as a guard band. Most commonly however, these white spaces exist naturally between used channels, since assigning nearby transmissions to immediately adjacent channels will cause destructive interference to both. In addition to white space assigned for technical reasons, there is also unused radio spectrum which has either never been used, or is becoming free as a result of technical changes. In particular, the switchover to digital television frees up large areas between about 50 MHz and 700 MHz. This is because digital transmissions can be packed into adjacent channels, while analog ones cannot. This means that the band can be \\"compressed\\" into fewer channels, while still allowing for more transmissions. In the United States, the abandoned television frequencies are primarily in the upper UHF \\"700-megahertz\\" band, covering TV channels 52 to 69 (698 to 806 MHz). U.S. television and its white spaces will continue to exist in UHF frequencies, as well as VHF frequencies for which mobile users and white-space devices require larger antennas. In the rest of the world, the abandoned television channels are VHF, and the resulting large VHF white spaces are being reallocated for the worldwide (except the U.S.) digital radio standard DAB and DAB+, and DMB. ==White-spaces devices== Various proposals, including IEEE 802.11af, IEEE 802.22 and those from the White Spaces Coalition, have advocated using white spaces left by the termination of analog TV to provide wireless broadband Internet access. A device intended to use these available channels is a white- spaces device (WSD). Such devices are designed to detect the presence of existing but unused areas of airwaves, such as those reserved for analog television, and utilize these unused airwaves to transmit signals for Internet connectivity. Such technology is predicted to improve the availability of broadband Internet and Wi-Fi in rural areas. Early ideas proposed including GNSS receivers and programming each WSD with a database of all TV stations in an area, however this would not have avoided other non-stationary or unlicensed users in the area, or any stations licensed or altered after the device was made. Additionally, these efforts may impact wireless microphones, medical telemetry, and other technologies that have historically relied on these open frequencies. Professional wireless microphones have used white space \\"for decades\\" previous to so-called white space devices. ==United States== Full power analog television broadcasts, which operated between the 54 MHz and 806 MHz (54–72, 76–88, 174–216, 470–608, and 614–806) television frequencies (Channels 2-69), ceased operating on June 12, 2009 as per a United States digital switchover mandate. At that time, full power TV stations were required to switch to digital transmission and operate only between 54 MHz and 698 MHz. This is also the timetable that the White Spaces Coalition has set to begin offering wireless broadband services to consumers. The delay allows time for the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to test the technology and make sure that it does not interfere with existing television broadcasts. Similar technologies could be used worldwide as much of the core technology is already in place.Eric Bangeman. The White Spaces Coalition's plans for fast wireless broadband: Fast broadband without fiber... or even wires\\", Ars Technica, 2007-4-17. Retrieved on June 12, 2007. Theatrical producers and sports franchises hoped to derail or delay the decision, arguing that their own transmissions – whether from television signals or from wireless microphones used in live music performances – could face interference from new devices that use the white spaces. However, the FCC rejected their arguments, saying enough testing has been done, and through new regulations, possible interference will be minimized. More of the broadcast spectrum was needed for wireless broadband Internet access, and in March 2009, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry introduced a bill requiring a study of efficient use of the spectrum. Academics have studied the matter and have promoted the idea of using computing technology to capture the benefits of the white space.Patrick S. Ryan, Wireless Communications and Computing at a Crossroads: New Paradigms and Their Impact on Theories Governing the Public's Right to Spectrum Access. Journal on Telecommunications & High Technology Law, Vol. 3, No. 2, p. 239, 2005 Trade groups The White Spaces Coalition was formed in 2007 by eight large technology companies that planned to deliver high speed internet access beginning in February 2009 to United States consumers via existing \\"white space\\" in unused television frequencies between 54 MHz and 698 MHz (TV Channels 2-51). The coalition expected speeds of 80 Mbit/s and above, and 400 to 800 Mbit/s for white space short-range networking. The group included Microsoft, Google, Dell, HP, Intel, Philips, Earthlink, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics. Many of the companies involved in the White Spaces Coalition were also involved in the Wireless Innovation Alliance. Another group calling itself the White Space Alliance was formed in 2011. Google sponsored a campaign named Free the Airwaves with the purpose of switching over the white spaces that were cleared up in 2009 by the DTV conversion process by the FCC and converted to an un-licensed spectrum that can be used by Wi-Fi-like devices. The National Association of Broadcasters disapproved of the project because they claimed it would reduce the broadcast quality of their TV signals. Preliminary test The Federal Communications Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology released a report dated July 31, 2007 with results from its investigation of two preliminary devices submitted. The report concluded that the devices did not reliably sense the presence of television transmissions or other incumbent users, hence are not acceptable for use in their current state and no further testing was deemed necessary.Initial Evaluation of the Performance of Prototype TV Band White Space Devices , 2007-7-31. Retrieved on August 2, 2007. However, on August 13, 2007, Microsoft filed a document with the FCC in which it described a meeting that its engineers had with FCC engineers from the Office of Engineering and Technology on August 9 and 10. At this meeting the Microsoft engineers showed results from their testing done with identical prototype devices and using identical testing methods that \\"detected DTV signals at a threshold of -114 dBm in laboratory bench testing with 100 percent accuracy, performing exactly as expected.\\" In the presence of FCC engineers, the Microsoft engineers took apart the device that the FCC had tested to find the cause of the poor performance. They found that \\"the scanner in the device had been damaged and operated at a severely degraded level\\" which explained the FCC unit's inability to detect when channels were occupied. It was also pointed out that the FCC was in possession of an identical backup prototype that was in perfect operating condition that they had not tested.Microsoft: FCC tested broken white spaces device, neglected backup unit , 2007-8-15. Retrieved on August 15, 2007. FCC decision TV broadcasters and other incumbent users of this spectrum (both licensed and unlicensed, including makers of wireless audio systems) feared that their systems would no longer function properly if unlicensed devices were to operate in the same spectrum. However, the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology released a report dated October 15, 2008, which evaluated prototype TV-band white spaces devices submitted by Adaptrum, The Institute for Infocomm Research, Motorola and Philips. The report concluded that these devices had met the burden of \\"proof of concept\\" in their ability to detect and avoid legacy transmissions,Evaluation of the Performance of Prototype TV Band White Space Devices, Phase II , 2008-10-15. Retrieved on October 24, 2008. although none of the tested devices adequately detected wireless microphone signals in the presence of a digital TV transmitter on an adjacent channel.

Retrieved on November 5, 2008 thereby silencing opposition from broadcasters. The actual Second Report and Order was released ten days later and contains some serious obstacles for the development and use of TV Band Devices as they are called by FCC. Devices must both consult an FCC-mandated database to determine which channels are available for use at a given location, and must also monitor the spectrum locally once every minute to confirm that no legacy wireless microphones, video assist devices or other emitters are present. If a single transmission is detected, the device may not transmit anywhere within the entire 6 MHz channel in which the transmission was received.Second Report and Order It was hoped that, within a year, this new access will lead to more reliable Internet access and other technologies. On September 23, 2010, the FCC released a Memorandum Opinion and Order that determined the final rules for the use of white space for unlicensed wireless devices.FCC Second Memorandum and Order, September 23, 2010 The new rules removed mandatory sensing requirements which greatly facilitates the use of the spectrum with geolocation based channel allocation. The final ruleshttps://www.ecfr.gov/cgi- bin/text- idx?SID=3437b1ccb4bfc915385716218f45f73c&mc;=true&node;=sp47.1.15.h&rgn;=div6 adopt a proposal from the White Spaces Coalition for very strict emission rules that prevent the direct use of IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) in a single channel effectively making the new spectrum unusable for Wi-Fi technologies. Broadcaster lawsuit On February 27, 2009, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the Association for Maximum Service Television asked a Federal court to shut down the FCC's authorization of white space wireless devices. The plaintiffs allege that portable, unlicensed personal devices operating in the same band as TV broadcasts have been \\"proven\\" to cause interference despite FCC tests to the contrary. The lawsuit was filed in a United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petition for review states that the FCC's decision to allow white space personal devices \\"will have a direct adverse impact\\" on MSTV's and NAB's members, and that the Commission's decision is \\"arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law.\\".Petition for Review A Motion to Govern the case was due to be considered on February 7, 2011.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-11A1.pdf In May 2012, the NAB announced it was dropping its court challenge of rules that allow the unlicensed use of empty airwaves between existing broadcast channels. United States tests On October 16, 2009, researchers at Microsoft Research Redmond, Washington built and deployed a white space network called WhiteFi. In this network, multiple clients connected to a single access point over UHF frequencies. The deployment included experiments to test how much data could be sent before interference became audible to nearby wireless microphones. On February 24, 2010, officials in Wilmington, North Carolina, which was the test market for the transition to digital television, unveiled a new municipal wireless network, after a month of testing. The network used the white spaces made available by the end of analog TV. Spectrum Bridge was to work to make sure TV stations in the market do not receive interference (\\"no interference issues\\" have been reported). The \\"smart city\\" network will not compete with cell phone companies but will instead be used for \\"national purposes\\", including government and energy monitoring. TV Band Service, made up of private investors, has put up cameras in parks, and along highways to show traffic. Other uses include water level and quality, turning off lights in ball parks, and public Wi-Fi in certain areas. TV Band had an 18-month experimental license. In 2011, the Yurok Tribe in Humboldt County, California began white space trials with telecommunications equipment provider Carlson Wireless of Arcata, California. In July 2013, West Virginia University became the first university in the United States to use vacant broadcast TV channels to provide the campus and nearby areas with wireless broadband Internet service. Also in July 2013, the Port of Pittsburgh evaluated White Space spectrum for enhancing inland waterway safety and utility with telecommunications equipment provider Metric Systems Corporation of Vista, California.http://www.prweb.com/releases/whitespacespectrum/raptorxpittsburgh/prweb11006653.htm ==Singapore== After FCC, Singapore Info-communications Media Development Authority is the second regulator in the world to have TV White Space regulated, ahead of UK and Canada. The Singapore efforts were driven mainly by the Singapore White Spaces Pilot Group (SWSPG) https://www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/imda/files/inner/pcdg/consultations/20140422_proposedallocationspectrumimt/singapore- white-spaces-pilot-group.pdf?la=en founded by the Institute for Infocomm Research, Microsoft and StarHub. The Institute for Infocomm Research subsequently spun off Whizpacehttps://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/PARTNERSHIP/ITEM/itemId/23 to commercialize TV White Space radio using strong IPs that were developed in the institute since 2006. ==United Kingdom== Ofcom, the licensing body of spectrum in the UK, has made white-space free to use.https://www.ofcom.org.uk/spectrum/radio-spectrum-and-the-law/licence- exempt-radio-use/licence-exempt- devices#collapsible-85766https://www.ofcom.org.uk/spectrum/spectrum- management/TV-white-space-databases Cambridge, United Kingdom tests On June 29, 2011, one of the largest commercial tests of white space Wi-Fi was conducted in Cambridge, England. The trial was conducted by Microsoft using technology developed by Adaptrum and backed by a consortium of ISP's and tech companies including Nokia, BSkyB, the BBC, and BT, with the actual network hardware being provided by Neul. In the demonstration, the Adaptrum whitespace system provided the broadband IP connectivity allowing a client-side Microsoft Xbox to stream live HD videos from the Internet. Also as part of the demo, a live Xbox/Kinect video chat was established between two Xbox/Kinect units connected through the same TV whitespace connection. These applications were demonstrated under a highly challenging radio propagation environment with more than 120 dB link loss through buildings, foliage, walls, furniture, people etc. and with severe multipath effects. In 2017, Microsoft further expanded their research to show that small cell LTE eNodeB's operating in TV White Space could be used to provide cost effective broadband to affordable housing residents. ==Canada== Industry Canada Consultation In August 2011, Industry Canada, the Canadian ministry for industry, launched a consultation on \\"Consultation on a Policy and Technical Framework for the Use of Non-Broadcasting Applications in the Television Broadcasting Bands Below 698 MHz\\" (pdf). The consultation closed on November 4, 2011. Submissions were received from a wide range of organisations from the telecoms and broadcast industries. ==Kenya== A pilot project by Indigo Telecom/Microsoft and the Kenyan government is reportedly delivering bandwidth speeds of up to 16 Mbit/s to three rural communities, which lack electricity - Male, Gakawa and Laikipia, using a solar-powered network. ==Namibia== , a pilot project called \\"Citizen Connect,\\" a collaboration between the Microsoft 4Afrika Initiative, the MyDigitalBridge Foundation, and the MCA-N (Millennium Challenge Account Namibia), is slated to deliver broadband Internet to \\"twenty-seven schools and seven circuit offices of the Ministry of Education in Omusati, Oshana and Ohangwena\\", using \\"TV White Space technology\\". ==South Africa== Google, in a partnership with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), CSIR Meraka Institute, the Wireless Access Providers Association (WAPA) and Carlson wireless delivers wireless access to 10 schools through 3 base stations at the campus of Stellenbosch University’s Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences in Tygerberg, Cape Town. There was an initial trial that took place within 10 schools in order to deliver affordable internet to the selected schools in South Africa without TV interference, and to spread awareness about future TVWS technologies in South Africa. The trial took place over 10 months, from March 25, 2013 to September 25, 2013. A second trial involved providing point-to-point Internet connectivity to five rural secondary schools in Limpopo province, with equally good results. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) subsequently issued regulations on the use of television white spaces in 2018. Three temporary TV white space spectrum licenses were issued by ICASA in April 2020, response to the Covid-19 pandemic, in the 470–694 MHz band, to Mthinthe Communications, Levin Global & Morai Solutions. ==Argentina== Microsoft, in a partnership with the communications authority of Argentina, Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM), planned to deliver wireless access to schools in the province of Mendoza on or around August, 2017. Microsoft will borrow the White Spaces hardware to ENACOM technicians, and national satellite operator ARSAT will act as the ISP.

Most of Fort Worth's tallest buildings and skyscrapers are located downtown. ==Attractions== Sundance Square AMC Theatre in Downtown Fort Worth Sundance Square began as an effort by Sid Bass to revitalize downtown Fort Worth in the early 1980s. At the time, downtown Fort Worth was in decline due to suburbanization. There were many empty gaps between existing skyscrapers and historic buildings that resulted in a pedestrian-unfriendly atmosphere. During many trips to New York City, Sid Bass was fascinated with the urban atmosphere with retail shops, restaurants, office buildings, and museums all working together to form one cohesive experience for the public. Sid did not want to relocate his business to New York so he brought a little of New York to Fort Worth. Sid Bass employed Thomas E. Woodward, AIA, of Woodward & Taylor Architects, a Dallas architectural firm to design Sundance Square because of his experience with historic structures and commercial buildings. Lewis Faulkner, AIA was the Project Architect and Manager for Woodward & Taylor. Woodward & Taylor placed the Knights of Pythias Building on the U. S. Department of Interior's list of Historic Buildings & Places. Today, Sundance Square is a pedestrian-friendly cluster of blocks in a portion of downtown Fort Worth that features bars, restaurants, museums, theaters, and retail. Sundance Square also has offices and residential units. Most buildings in Sundance Square are either historic or reconstructed, with two modern skyscrapers designed by Paul Rudolph, architect, and a hotel being exceptions. Sidewalks in Sundance Square are paved with brick. Lewis Faulkner, AIA Parks and plazas Fort Worth Water Gardens Sundance Square Plaza is a 55,000 square foot plaza spanning two city blocks within Sundance Square. The plaza features four large Teflon umbrellas, a permanent stage built into the Westbrook building, jetted fountains that illuminate at night, various other fountains, and a pavilion that can be rented. Sundance Square Plaza is bookended by two office buildings: The Westbrook and The Commerce. Businesses within the Sundance Square Plaza include: Bird Cafe, Del Frisco's Grille, Jamba Juice, Silver Leaf Cigar Bar, Starbucks and Taco Diner. Fort Worth Water Gardens - A 4.3-acre (17,000 m2) contemporary park, designed by architect Philip Johnson, that features three unique pools of water offering a calming and cooling oasis for downtown patrons. The gardens were used in the finale of the 1976 sci-fi film Logan's Run. (In mid-2004 the Water Gardens had to be closed due to several drownings. It has reopened after preventive measures have been installed.) Arts and culture Bass Performance Hall Bass Performance Hall - Bass Hall is the permanent home to the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, Texas Ballet Theater, Fort Worth Opera, and the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition and Cliburn Concerts. Convention Center The Fort Worth Convention Center includes an 11,200 seat multi-purpose arena. ==Notable buildings== The Tower, formerly the Bank One Tower, was severely damaged in the March 28, 2000 tornado. It was converted into a residential tower in 2004. Before the redevelopment, The Tower was covered in plywood and metal panels, and considered to be demolished. The Tower now has a new facade and a new top feature that makes it the fourth tallest building in the city. City Center Development features two twin towers, the 38-story D.R. Horton Tower (1984) and the 33-story Wells Fargo Tower (1982). From the top, they are shaped like pinwheels. The Hilton Fort Worth opened in 1921 and is where U.S. President John F. Kennedy last stayed before he was assassinated in Dallas. ==Government and infrastructure== Fort Worth City Hall is located at 200 Texas Street and was constructed in 1971.

The Water Gardens also appear in another science-fiction film of the period, The Lathe of Heaven (1980). The interior of St. Patrick Cathedral was filmed for the 1990 comedy film Problem Child. ==Urban neighborhoods surrounding downtown== Fort Worth has several other urban neighborhoods in close proximity to the central business district. Stockyards District Fort Worth Live Stock Exchange (postcard, circa 1908) The Fort Worth Stockyards, north of downtown, offers a taste of the old west and the Chisholm Trail at the site of the historic cattle drives and rail access. The district is filled with restaurants, clubs, gift shops, and attractions such as the twice daily Texas Longhorn cattle drives through the streets, historic reenactments, the Stockyards Museum, the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame, and Billy Bob's, the world's largest country and western music venue. Cultural District The Cultural District is west of the West Seventh District and Downtown, and is home to many Fort Worth museums, such as the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Kimbell Art Museum, Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, and National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, among others. The district is also home to Will Rogers Memorial Center, which hosts the annual Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo. West Seventh District \\"West Seventh\\" can refer to the gentrifying neighborhood along West 7th Street between the Cultural District and downtown, the mixed-use development within the district, or the street itself. Most gentrification in the West Seventh District has happened south of West 7th Street. Near Southside / Medical District The Near Southside is an urban neighborhood just south of downtown. Many Fort Worth hospitals are in this district, including Baylor All Saints Medical Center, Cook Children's Medical Center, Texas Health Harris Methodist, and JPS Health Network, among others. Most pedestrian activity in the Near Southside takes place along Magnolia Avenue. Texas Christian University Texas Christian University is Fort Worth's most prominent university. The 325-acre campus is southwest of the Near Southside and downtown. Neighborhoods surrounding the university are predominantly made up of historic single family homes. In recent years, demand for more student housing has resulted in many historic houses being torn down for larger houses designed to accommodate large numbers of students, upsetting many existing residents. Nightlife options and restaurants geared to students can be found along University Drive and Berry Street. Panther Island The Trinity River Vision Authority, Tarrant Regional Water District, City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Streams & Valleys Inc, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are cooperating in an effort to redevelop Panther Island, an 800-acre area north of downtown along the Trinity River. The first part of the redevelopment plan calls for infrastructure improvements and flood protection. The second part calls for mixed-use development and sustainable growth along the Trinity River, which would result in a vibrant urban neighborhood. Panther Island is home to several attractions, including Coyote Urban Drive-In Movie Theater, Panther Island Pavilion, and LaGrave Field (former home of the Fort Worth Cats and Fort Worth Vaqueros FC). ==ReferencesExternal links== * Downtown Fort Worth's official website Category:Neighborhoods in Fort Worth, Texas Fort Worth ","title":"Downtown Fort Worth"},{"id":"12352353","text":"Hypericum acostanum is a species of flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae.

Efforts to find solutions for the flood problems date back to at least the mid-1960s, and numerous reports and studies since then confirmed the need for flood control in the area. However, little progress was made until 1993, when Wahoo, Saunders County, and the Lower Platte North Natural Resource District began seriously investigating the possibility of constructing a large reservoir just north of Wahoo. Preliminary studies in 1994 and 1995 indicated that the idea held promise, and in 1996 the project partners commissioned a more detailed feasibility study. That study, completed in June 1997, reaffirmed the merits of the plan and recommended that the project go forward.

Wajda's World War II film alludes to the Old Testament story of Samson, who had supernatural physical strength. But unlike the Biblical character, Wajda's Samson has great emotional strength. ==Plot== A dark coming-of-age film, Samson follows its Jewish protagonist (Serge Merlin) from an anti-Semitic private school to a prison, then into a Jewish ghetto, and finally over the ghetto wall to the outside world. Wajda uses this journey as a means to explore expressionist cinematography and the weighty issues facing the Jewish people. The construction of the Jewish ghetto is communicated through a single, stationary shot. A shabbily dressed mass is clustered in front of the camera, and a pair of hands with a hammer and nails secures one board at a time, until the shot of people has been replaced with a shot of a wall. Through minimalism and simplicity, Wadja establishes a separation between the world of the impoverished Jew and the world outside the ghetto. The viewer looking on as the ghetto walls block the view of what happening inside, is made to feel detached from the horror inside. One question Wajda raises is that of Jewish solidarity and the guilt of being saved while one's brethren are suffering. Samson escapes from the Jewish ghetto but immediately wants to return. Although he could enjoy a comfortable life of cocktails and women, he'd rather be in the ghetto, collecting corpses off the streets. Samson argues that his place is with the Jews, that he should suffer alongside them. A fake-blond beauty offers a different take. She confides to Samson that she's Jewish and has been concealing her roots in order to avoid the ghetto. Although she argues passionately, Samson's emotional strength inevitably inspires her to accept her fate as a Jew. When Samson is bruised and exhausted, lying on the ground, he is encouraged by a close friend who says, \\"one man can suffer such blows and rise again.\\" For Wajda, this is the greatness displayed in Jewish history. Samson is a scrawny, haggard young man, who says very little and might almost border on boringly average; but he has the ability to rise again despite any blow, proving his strength of spirit. ==Production== Of Samson, Wajda wrote, ==Reception== Georges Sadoul \\"Les Lettres Françaises\\", Paris, 1964 \\"In its first part, the film is a masterpiece. Never before has Wajda revealed such virtuosity. He has not succumbed to the temptation of formal exercise. Far from any baroque mannerism, he says what he has to say firmly, even brutally, while using a minimum of effects, in shades nearly classical. This style present throughout the film reveals a great talent on the threshold of maturity.\\" Konrad Eberhardt \\"Film\\", Warsaw, September 1961 No attempt has been made to discuss this new offer, so different from Wajda's previous works, in terms of creative, rather than propaganda merits, or the author's intentions and the values which the film contributes to our cinematography. ==Cast== *Serge Merlin ...

Three existing species were transferred to this genus and three new species were described. In 2009 a new species, Cetopsidium soniae, was described bringing the number of species in the genus to seven. == Species == There are currently seven recognized species in this genus: * Cetopsidium ferreirai Vari, Ferraris & de Pinna, 2005 * Cetopsidium minutum (C. H. Eigenmann, 1912) * Cetopsidium morenoi (Fernández-Yépez, 1972) * Cetopsidium orientale (Vari, Ferraris & Keith, 2003) * Cetopsidium pemon Vari, Ferraris & de Pinna, 2005 * Cetopsidium roae Vari, Ferraris & de Pinna, 2005 * Cetopsidium soniae Vari & Ferraris, 2009 ==Distribution== Fishes of this genus are found in the rivers of northern South America. ==Description== The combination of the presence of a dorsal fin with an ossified spinelet and the presence of pectoral-fin and dorsal-fin spines distinguishes the species of Cetopsidium from all other genera in the Cetopsinae. A lateral line extending to over the posterior portion of the base of the anal fin but falling short of the caudal peduncle is also unique in this genus; the lateral line is usually longer than this, though it is shorter in two species of Denticetopsis. Cetopsidium species have mental barbels extending posteriorly beyond the rear margin of the opercle and a deeply forked, symmetrical caudal-fin margin with the tips of the lobes slightly blunt or rounded. The body is elongate to moderately robust; anteriorly the body is not compressed much, but becomes progressively compressed posteriorly. The lateral line is incomplete, unbranched, and midlateral. In most species the dorsal profile is straight, though it may be slightly convex from the head to the dorsal fin origin in some species. The ventral profile is slightly convex at the abdomen but is straight posteriorly. The caudal peduncle depth is approximately equal to its length in most species, though the depth is less than the length in C. roae and greater in C. orientale. The eyes are placed on the sides of the head and are visible from above, but not from below. The mouth is subterminal and its width is anywhere between 40-60% of the head length. They have three pairs of barbels, one pair of maxillary barbels and two pairs of mental barbels; the medial mental barbels are slightly shorter than the lateral mental barbels, which are in turn slightly shorter than the slender maxillary barbels. The anal fin is moderately long, beginning about halfway down the body, with the posterior- most anal fin rays with a slight, membranous attachment to the body. The pelvic fins are usually small. The first pectoral fin ray is spinous and is slightly longer than one-half the length of the first branched ray; however, the spine may have a prolonged distal filament in mature males. Sexual dimorphism is observed in C. ferreirai, C. morenoi, C. orientale, and C. pemon, but not in C. minutum or C. roae. Presumed mature males have the first ray of the dorsal and pectoral fins extended into filaments except in C. ferreirai. Also, the anal fin has a broadly convex margin rather than a straight margin. Cetopsidium species are smaller than Cetopsis species, growing to only SL. == References == Category:Cetopsidae Category:Fish of South America Category:Fish of Brazil Category:Fish of Colombia Category:Fish of French Guiana Category:Fish of Guyana Category:Fish of Suriname Category:Fish of Venezuela Category:Catfish genera Category:Freshwater fish genera ","title":"Cetopsidium"},{"id":"12352494","text":"Mammea malayana is a species of flowering plant in the family Calophyllaceae.

His parents, recognizing their son's musical talent, sent him to Paris to receive an education at an early age. He became recognised for his voice, primarily for his renditions of the Pie Jesu from Gabriel Fauré's Requiem at the Église de la Madeleine. The young Aubert met Fauré at the Paris Conservatoire, and he regularly attended at his composition classes, which greatly influenced his development. Aubert became an excellent pianist. In 1911, he premiered Maurice Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales, which were written for and dedicated to him. He also worked as a piano and composition teacher, both privately and on the faculty of the Conservatoire de Paris. He counted among his students Henry Barraud, Jean-Marie Beaudet, Jean Berger, Marinus Flipse, and Georges Savaria. He composed music for the church, several ballets, mélodies, and incidental music for the stage. Although Breton by birth at a time of intense Breton nationalism, he was little inspired by his home region, although he was a founding member in 1912 of the Association des Compositeurs Breton. Aubert wrote popular songs, notably for Marie Dubas. He also contributed to the magazines Chantecler, Paris-soir, Le Journal and Opéra. Aubert wrote one opera in three acts based on classic fairy tales by Charles Perrault to a libretto by J. Chenevière entitled La fôret bleu (\\"The Blue Forest\\"). The work was composed between 1904 and 1911, and individual acts were performed while the work was in progress. The first complete staged performance took place in Geneva on 7 January 1913. The enchanting characters and delightful plot enabled the work to achieve popular success in other theaters, including Boston later the same year. The work did not appear in Paris until 1924, where it was staged at the Opéra-Comique (Salle Favart). The opera was recorded for French radio in 1954, conducted by Eugène Bigot, with Raymond Malvasio, Martha Angelici, Claudine Collart, Jacqueline Brumaire, Louis Noguéra and Lucien Lovano in the cast.Bade, Patrick. Rarissima - rescued by the internet, Classical Recordings Quarterly, autumn 2014, no. 78, p. 4.

The state's Democratic Party at the time was very weak, so the two parties merged in 1891, and in 1892 the joint Democratic-Independent party was able to gain control of all of the state's constitutional offices except for that of the North Dakota Secretary of State. One of the party's newly elected officers was Laura J. Eisenhuth, North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction, who became the first woman elected to a statewide office in the United States. The success of the D-I party was very short-lived, however; the Republican Party regained control of all lost offices in 1894, and the party quickly dissolved. A half century later, North Dakota Democrats merged with the progressive Nonpartisan League to form the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party in a more successful and long-lasting arrangement. ==See also== *Politics of North Dakota *Political party strength in North Dakota ==Notes== Category:Political parties in North Dakota Category:Government of North Dakota Category:Political parties established in 1891 Category:1891 establishments in North Dakota Category:1894 disestablishments in North Dakota Category:Political parties disestablished in 1894 ","title":"North Dakota Democratic-Independent Party"},{"id":"12352614","text":"Montrouziera cauliflora, the giant Houp tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Clusiaceae.

Normally using two layers of interconnect, it must connect the specified pins on the top and bottom of the channel. Specified nets must also be brought out to the left and right of the channel, but may be brought out in any order. The height of the channel is not specified - the router computes what height is needed. Figure 2: A solution to the channel routing problem shown above. Solutions are not unique, and this is just one of the many possible. The density of a channel, defined for every x within the channel, is the number of nets that appear on both the left and right of a vertical line at that x. The maximum density is a lower bound on the height of the channel. A \\"cyclic constraint\\" occurs when two pins occur in the same column (but with different orders) in at least two columns.

It is one of seven hospitals in the University of Florida Health system, and one of two campuses for UF's Health Science Center, the other being UF Health at Jacksonville. ==History== William A. Shands was a Florida state Senator, elected from the 32nd District in the mid-1940s. He was convinced that the best way to enhance the Gainesville community was to establish a teaching hospital at the University of Florida. There was general agreement that the state needed a teaching hospital, but located in a large city, such as Jacksonville, Miami or Tampa. His dedicated efforts were critical to obtaining state funding for a teaching hospital in Gainesville. The University of Florida Colleges of Medicine and Nursing opened in 1956. Two years later, the UF Teaching Hospital was started, on October 20, 1958. In 1965, it was renamed W. A. Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics in honor of the man who did so much to make the facility a reality. The institution later became Shands Hospital, part of the Shands HealthCare network. As part of the University of Florida Health Science Center, the hospital is a 996-bed tertiary care facility with 241 intensive care beds. Shands is a Level I trauma center and a leading organ-transplant center. Health Science Center at the University of Florida The J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center — is named for the former University of Florida president—has expanded since 1956 into the most comprehensive academic health center in the Southeast. The \\"center\\" now encompasses six colleges, a statewide network of affiliated hospitals and clinics including Shands Hospital at UF as the flagship teaching hospital and the neighboring Veterans Affairs Medical Center of Gainesville. The UF Health Science Center comprises the following Colleges: Dentistry, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Veterinary Medicine. The University of Florida is one of only a handful of universities to have all these health-related professional schools—including veterinary medicine—and to house most of them under one roof. Shands is as a structure connected to the Stetson Medical Sciences Building and the Academic Research Building—both research lab buildings—the Dental Tower, and buildings housing Nursing and Pharmacy. In addition, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center is connected via an underground passage to the ground floor of Shands. Other institutions include the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida, one of the world's largest research institutions devoted to the challenges resulting from brain and nervous system disorders. In 2004, Shands at the University of Florida once again joined the prestigious ranks of America's top medical institutions in the 15th annual U.S. News & World Report guide to \\"America's Top Hospitals.\\" Included among the nation's 50 top academic medical centers, Shands at UF is recognized in 12 clinical specialty areas in 2012's comprehensive report for excellence. Specialty Ranks: Urology (20), Pulmonology (31), Neurology & Neurosurgery (32), Cancer (36), Nephrology (37), Gastroenterology (41), Cardiology & Heart Surgery (47).

Ruff attended the Yale School of Music as an undergraduate (Bachelor of Music, 1953) and graduate student (Master of Music, 1954). ==Professional career== Performing Ruff played in the Mitchell-Ruff Duo with pianist Dwike Mitchell for over 50 years. Mitchell and Ruff first met in 1947, when they were teenaged servicemen stationed at the former Lockbourne Air Force Base in Ohio; Mitchell recruited Ruff to play bass with his unit band for an Air Force radio program. Mitchell and Ruff later played in Lionel Hampton's band but left in 1955 to form their own group. Together as the Mitchell-Ruff Duo, they played as \\"second act\\" to artists such as Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Dizzy Gillespie. From 1955 to 2011, the duo regularly performed and lectured in the United States, Asia, Africa, and Europe. The Mitchell-Ruff Duo was the first jazz band to play in the Soviet Union (1959) and in China (1981). Mitchell died in 2013. Ruff was chosen by John Hammond to be the bass player for the recording sessions of Songs of Leonard Cohen, an album first released in 1967. During those sessions, he and Cohen laid down the bed tracks for most of the songs on the album. He is one of the founders of the W. C. Handy Music Festival in Florence, Alabama. The first festival was held in 1982. Teaching Ruff was a faculty member at the Yale School of Music from 1971 until his retirement in 2017, teaching music history, ethnomusicology, and arranging. Ruff's classes at Yale, often with partner Dwike Mitchell, were free-flowing jam sessions: roller-coaster rides through the colors of American Improvisational Music. The duo could play in the style of most notable jazz artists and related styles. They had a large repertoire. He is founding Director of the Duke Ellington Fellowship Program at Yale, a community-based organization sponsoring artists mentoring and performing with Yale students and young musicians from the New Haven Public School System. The program was founded in 1972 as a \\"Conservatory Without Walls\\" to \\"'capture the essence and spirit' of the tradition of African-American music\\". By its 30th anniversary in 2002, the program had reached an estimated 180,000 students in New Haven schools. In 1976-1977, he held a visiting appointment at Duke University, where he oversaw the jazz program and directed the Duke Jazz Ensemble. Ruff has also been on faculty at UCLA and Dartmouth. ==Awards== He is a 1994 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. Ruff received the Connecticut Governor's Arts Award in 2000 for his work with the Duke Ellington Fellowship Program. Ruff was awarded with the Sanford Medal in May 2013. The Sanford Medal is the highest honor from Yale University's School of Music. ==Publications== Ruff is known for uncovering links between traditional black gospel music and unaccompanied psalm singing. Ruff's theory is that the Scottish Presbyterian practice of lining out – in which a precentor read or chanted a line of the psalm, which was then sung by the congregation – led to the call and response form of black gospel music. Ruff co-created the documentary \\"A Conjoining of Ancient Song\\", which focuses on a rapidly vanishing form of congregational singing that is shared by Scottish, African American, and Native American music. It received its world premiere screening at Yale in 2013. Ruff's work in this area is also a subject of Sterlin Harjo's 2014 documentary film, This May Be the Last Time. He has written about classical composer Paul Hindemith, who was one of his teachers at Yale, and about his professional experiences with jazz composers Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn. In 1992, Ruff published his memoir, titled A Call to Assembly: The Autobiography of a Musical Storyteller. The autobiography was hailed as \\"an unmitigated delight\\" and was awarded the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award. == Discography == Solo * The Smooth Side of Ruff (Columbia, 1968) * Gregorian Chant, Plain Chant, and Spirituals Recorded in Saint Mark's Cathedral, Venice (Kepler Label, 1984; CD reissue 2003) With the Mitchell- Ruff Duo * The Mitchell-Ruff Duo (Epic, 1956) * Campus Concert (Epic, 1957; 2002 Sony CD reissue combined with Brazilian Trip) * Appearing Nightly (Roulette Records), 1958) * Jazz Mission to Moscow (Roulette, 1959) * The Sound of Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein (Roulette, 1960) * The Mitchell-Ruff Duo plus Strings & Brass (Roulette, 1960) * Jazz for Juniors (Roulette, 1960) * Brazilian Trip (Epic Records, 1967; Forma Records 1966 Brazilian release as A Viagem with different track order and names; 2002 Sony CD reissue combined with Campus Concert) * Dizzy Gillespie and the Mitchell Ruff Duo in Concert (Mainstream, 1971) * Strayhorn: A Mitchell-Ruff Interpretation (Mainstream, 1972; 50th anniversary [of the duo] reissue, Kepler Label, CD MR-2421, 2004) * Dizzy Gillespie Live With The Mitchell-Ruff Duo (Book-of-the-Month Club Records, 1982, 3-record-set; first record is same as the Mainstream 1971 record) * Virtuoso Elegance in Jazz (Kepler Label, M-R 1234, 1984; CD reissue 2003) * Dizzy Gillespie and the Mitchell-Ruff Duo: Enduring Magic (Blackhawk Records, 1986) * Breaking the Silence - The Mitchell-Ruff Duo (Kepler Label, CD 2380, 2000) With the Mitchell-Ruff Trio [including Charlie Smith, on drums] * The Catbird Seat (Atlantic, 1961; reissued on CD combined with Les McCann, Much Les as 20 Special Fingers) * After this Message (Atlantic, 1966) With John Rodgers * The Harmony of the World: A Realization for the Ear of Johannes Kepler's Astronomical Data from Harmonices Mundi 1619 (Kepler Label, 1979; CD reissue [date?]) As sideman With Clifford Coulter * Do It Now!

It was released on 17 June 2004 by Pasaj Müzik. It was Erçetin's first album released by this music company. The preparations for Melek began immediately after the release of Neden in May 2002. It is a pop album with six of its songs being written by Erçetin herself. The album was produced by Rıza Erekli. Melek contains two classical Turkish songs, previously performed by Zeki Müren. It consists of 14 songs in total, and musician Ceza was featured on the eighth song \\"Şehir\\". The album's lead single \\"Melek\\", was released together with a music video. The second music video was made for the song \\"Meğer\\". Both of these videos were directed by the album's art director Bozkurt Bayer. Candan Erçetin, who is known for producing her own works, received generally positive reviews from critics who stated that her music addressed a wide range of people. Melek ranked first on D&R;'s list of best-selling albums in Turkey and kept that position for five weeks. By selling 406,000 copies in 2004, it received a gold certification from MÜ-YAP. The remixed version of the album's songs were later released in her 2005 album Remix'5. == Background and content == After the huge commercial success of her 2000 album Elbette, Erçetin stopped working with Mete Özgencil for her next studio album Neden (2002), and wrote and composed most of the songs by herself. For her 2003 album, Chante Hier Pour Aujourd'hui, she performed a number of French chansons and received positive reviews from the critics. Erçetin started working on her next studio album right after releasing Neden in May 2002. As with Çapkın (1997), Elbette and Neden, the recordings for the album were done at the Erekli & Tunç studio. At the end, 14 songs were produced for the new album. On 17 June 2004, Erçetin's fifth studio album Melek was released by Pasaj Müzik \\"from an excited huge team for those who love each other, love new works, and love music.\\" This was her first album published by Pasaj Müzik, after she ended her contract with Topkapı Müzik. Produced by Rıza Erekli, the album contained 11 new songs (for this album 25 different songs were prepared, out of which 11 were chosen), 2 cover songs (\\"Bir Yangının Külünü\\" and \\"Gökyüzünde Yalnız Gezen Yıldızlar\\" originally performed by Zeki Müren) and 1 different version of one of the album's main 11 songs. Six of the songs on Melek were written solely by Candan Erçetin, and composed by her. Aylin Atalay, with whom she had worked on her previous albums, wrote two songs for Erçetin's new album, \\"Bahane\\" and \\"Yaşıyorum\\", despite being busy with studying English language and literature. Cihan Güçlü, a conservatory student who joined the album team to gain studio experience, helped with composing the song \\"Şehir\\". In her desire to make a song about the city she was born in, Erçetin chose to perform a hip hop song and she decided to collaborate with the \\"modern singer\\" Ceza on it. After the song was prepared, Erçetin made it known that she wanted Ceza to be featured on the song as well. Ceza later talked about the experience: > \\"The idea was actually brought forward by Candan Erçetin. It was a dream of > mine, but I had not succeeded in contacting her. She had released a song in > 1998, with the lyrics 'Everything is a lie in the world, except death'. My > mother was diagnosed with cancer during that period. The song affected me on > an emotional level. I started to love her from that moment. It was both her > music and the spirit and quality in it that made me want to work with her, > out of all the artists who make music with different styles in Turkey. One > night before the day she called me, I was thinking about Candan Erçetin's > songs. The next day I received the phone call. What I wanted with my heart > had now happened. [...] I accepted [the offer] without thinking. [...] I sat > at my home, brought a book and pen, and wrote the first part. Then we went > to the studio. Ms. Candan said 'That's a little bit short. I'd be glad if > you make it longer'. I sat down again and wrote the last part in the studio. > It took me no more than half an hour.\\" Melek entered D&R;'s list of best-selling albums on 27 June 2004 and topped the chart. It continued to keep that position on the weeks of 4 July, 11 July, 18 July and 25 July.Melek on the list of best-selling albums: *27 June 2004: *4 July 2004: *11 July 2004: *18 July 2004: *25 July 2004: On 1 August 2004, with the release of Mustafa Sandal's İste (2004) and Hande Yener's Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor (2004), the album went down to number three. By the end of the year, it continued to remain among the top 10, and on 19 December 2004 it ranked tenth on the list. The album stayed among the top 10 albums for about five months. According to MÜ-YAP, the album sold 406,000 copies in 2004, and as a result it received a gold certification. In 2005, the remixed versions of the songs \\"Bu Sabah\\", \\"Bir Yangının Külünü\\", \\"Gökyüzünde Yalnız Gezen Yıldızlar\\", \\"Melek\\", \\"Sonsuz\\" and \\"Şehir\\" were included in the album Remix'5 and released by Pasaj Müzik. == Critical reception == Melek received positive reviews from music critics. Noktas Cumhur Canbazoğlu described Erçetin as \\"one of the rare names that can produce works exclusive to themselves\\" and noted that just like her other albums that were released in the 2000s Erçetin had continued to produce her new work using the elements of Turkish pop music. He also stated that with Melek, the singer had addressed a wide range of listeners \\"from hip-hop to art music, from Balkan melodies to Western ballads with modern infrastructures.\\" Radioman Michael Kuyucu believed that Melek had more potential to become a hit than the singer's previous album. He believed that in the album Erçetin portrays \\"a sad, sometimes desperate woman, and deals with desperation of a large part of the society, causing an uproar.\\" In his opinion, the album's format was as if someone was talking to himself/herself and Melek was in fact the story of the lives of Erçetin's audience. Hürriyet Tolga Akyıldız wrote that Candan Erçetin had not broken the consistency and professionalism of her posture since her first album. The \\"modern but simple arrangements with consistent and self-confident sounds\\" in the album caught his attention. He also stated that the album \\"was about a woman whose love pains are not over, and despite being abandoned and facing unfaithfulness, she had learned to stand on her own\\". == Music video == Erçetin had described the album's lead single \\"Melek\\" as \\"a cheerful song that sees life through pink glasses, doesn't feed us troubles, and helps us realize different angels in life\\". The first music video of the album was made for this song. It was directed by Bozkurt Bayer and recorded in Nişantaşı, Şişli. The video was released on 30 September 2004. Erçetin played in the video together with the baby İpek Işık, her cat Blanche, and her boyfriend of two months. Soykut Turan did the video's cinematography. The second and final music video was released for \\"Meğer\\", the album's best song according to music critics. The video was recorded on 30 December 2004 at Ata Studios and it was directed by Bozkurt Bayer. Tolga Kutlar did its cinematography while Nalan Merter served as the director's assistant. In the video, Erçetin does not perform the song, and instead her facial expressions and mimics are used. == Track listing == ;Notes *\\"Melek\\" includes samples from Giorgos Alkaios's song \\"Vgale To Karfi\\". *\\"Ağlıyor musun?\\" includes samples from Red Hot Chili Peppers's song \\"Can't Stop\\" . *\\"Şehir\\" includes samples from İlhan İrem's song \\"Çarpıntı\\". == Personnel == *Pasaj Müzik – production *Rıza Erekli – album producer *Candan Erçetin – vocals, producer, songwriter, composer *Alper Erinç – arrangement, accordion, bass, guitar, Pro Tools arrangement *Aylin Atalay – songwriter *Ceza – vocals, songwriter *Hikmet Münir Ebcioğlu – songwriter *Sinan – songwriter *Barlas Erinç – songwriter, composition, arrangement *Şemsi Belli – songwriter *Ali Teoman Alpay – composition *Muzaffer İlkar – composition *Saša Lošić – composition *Cihan Güçlü – arrangement, composition, guitar *Nuri Irmak – composition, piano *Sunay Özgür – arrangement *Çağlar Yılmazkul – arrangement *Hakkı Öztürk – cello *Göksun Çavdar – clarinet, saxophone *Hüsnü Şenlendirici – clarinet, trumpet *Hamdi Akatay – goblet drum *İlyas Tetik – violin *Ahmet Kadri Rizeli – kemenche *Ray Staff (Alchemy Mastering) – mastering *Eyüp Hamiş – ney *Hamdi Akatay – percussion *Mehmet Akatay – percussion *Tolga Görsev – recording, vocals, Turkish tambur *Nihal Bilgen – recording assistant, co-producer, Pro Tools arrangement *Erekli & Tunç – recording studio, mixing *Erkut Gökgöz – trumpet *Mustafa Süder – viola *Kempa – bowed string instruments *Bozkurt Bayer – art director *Hakan Aydoğan – photography *Hakan Köse – hair and make-up Credits adapted from Meleks album booklet.Melek (album booklet).

It is situated on Isabela Island and reaches . It is a shield volcano with a characteristic upturned soup bowl shape. The volcano was named after Theodor Wolf, a German geologist who studied the Galapagos Islands in the 19th century. Wolf Island in the north of the Galapagos is also named after the geologist. Its height makes Wolf Volcano an \\"ultra prominent peak\\", which is a peak with a topographic prominence of over 1500m. == Geology == In a process similar to the formation of the Hawaiian islands, the Galapagos (along with associated hotspot) appear to be created from a mantle plume. This plume stays in place while the Nazca Plate moves above it; the relative movement of this plate is 0.46 degrees per million years. (deg/m.y. figure is on page 1110) The volcano itself is estimated to be less than half a million years old; the oceanic plate beneath it is theorized to be around 10 million years old. Wolf is situated at the northern end of Isabela Island in the Galapagos, and sits on the equator, one of six coalescing volcanoes that make up this island (the others being Ecuador, Darwin, Alcedo, Sierra Negra, and Cerro Azul). Along with the Fernandina Island volcano, the western Galapagos volcanoes have similar structures that differ from the volcanoes in the eastern part of the archipelago. The western volcanoes are higher and have larger calderas than those to the east, they are also shaped like an upturned soup bowl. Wolf reaches a height of over 1700 metres; the caldera is 6 by 7 km and has a depth of 700m. Only Cerro Azul has a caldera of similar depth in the Galapagos. Following the last eruption, there was collapse in the caldera, causing its stepped appearance. Wolf has very steep slopes reaching 35 degrees in places, making access difficult. The first historical eruption in the Galapagos was recorded for this volcano in 1797; a further ten eruptions have been recorded since then, the last being on May 25, 2015. Eruptions prior to 1797 have been dated from analysis of surface exposures. The newest lavas are on the eastern and southern sides as well as within the caldera. Lava flows from Wolf are unusual for a mid-ocean island and also differ from the two volcanoes next to it, Ecuador and Darwin, and other volcanoes closer to the centre of the plume. The lavas from Wolf are similar to those erupted from the Galapagos Spreading Center, a mid-ocean ridge over 200 km away, which may be due to interaction between the plume, which is centred on Fernandina, and the upper mantle. == Wildlife == As is common in the Galapagos, Wolf Volcano has unique fauna, differing from not only the other islands in the group but also its neighbouring volcanoes on the same island. It has its own subspecies of Galapagos tortoise, Chelonoidis nigra becki which has a saddleback shell and is found on the northern and western slopes of the volcano, away from the more recent lava flows where there is denser vegetation. However, tortoise subspecies from many different Galapagos islands have been abandoned at Wolf Volcano by ships which at one time collected the tortoise as a food source. C. n. becki is threatened due to population pressures such as predation by feral cats. During a 2008 survey of over 1600 specimens on Wolf Volcano, all morphologies of tortoise were found, including two that in shape are similar to Lonesome George. DNA studies of these specimens are currently being undertaken.Galapagos Conservancy In 2009, a new species of land iguana, the pink land iguana, was identified on the slopes of Wolf Volcano. The pink land iguana had been discovered by park rangers in 1986 and studied by scientists since 2000, and identified as a separate species in 2009. Scientists are unsure where the species developed, as it is believed to have separated from the other land iguana of Galapagos prior to the formation of Wolf volcano or Isabela Island. == Ecology == The natural habitat is under threat from the introduction of goats. The Galapagos National Park has instituted Project Isabela to eradicate feral goats from around Wolf. ==2015 eruption== Inactive for 33 years, the Wolf volcano erupted May 25, 2015. The volcano is not located near a populated area. The lava is flowing down the volcano's east and southeast sides, so the pink land iguana inhabiting the north and west sides have not been endangered.June 11, 2015 NASA photograph == See also == * Volcanoes of the Galápagos Islands * List of volcanoes in Ecuador == References  External links == * Wolf Volcano at NASA Earth Observatory *Benjamin Bernard, etal.: Chronology and phenomenology of the 1982 and 2015 Wolf volcano eruptions, Galápagos Archipelago.

He was tall and weighed 180 pounds. Born in Valley Falls, Kansas, Marsh was signed originally by the Chicago Cubs in after graduating from Chicago's Steinmetz High School in 1941. Marsh joined the Navy during World War II and was discharged in 1945. He made his big league debut on April 19, 1949 at the age of 25 for the Indians, to whom he'd been sent in an unknown transaction before the 1947 season. He appeared in only one game that year, as a pinch runner. He did not play any major league ball in 1950. In , he appeared in 130 games for the St. Louis Browns, who received him and $35,000 for Snuffy Stirnweiss and Merl Combs in a trade with the Indians on April 1 of that year. He hit .243 with four home runs, 21 doubles and 43 RBI in 445 at-bats that season, walking 36 times and striking out 56 times. 1951 would end up being the only season in which he appeared in 100 or more games. was an interesting season for Marsh. He started the season with the Browns, but on May 12 was traded with Lou Sleater to the Washington Senators for Cass Michaels. Less than one month later, the Senators traded him back to the Browns for Earl Rapp. Marsh had started off poorly with the Browns that year, hitting only .208 in his first 11 games, thus prompting his trade to the Senators. He did even worse with the Senators though, appearing in nine games with them and batting only .087. His second turn with the Browns that year proved to be much more successful – in 76 games, he hit .287 with two home runs and 26 RBI. Overall that year, he hit .258 with two home runs, 28 RBI and 29 runs scored. On January 20, 1953, he was traded to the White Sox for Dixie Upright and $25,000. His first year with the White Sox was rather bumpy, as he hit only .200 in 98 at-bats with them (62 games). He had a relatively good year in with them, playing in 62 games and hitting .306. His success that year did not keep him in Chicago though, as he was traded with Matt Batts, Don Ferrarese, and Don Johnson to the Orioles for Jim Brideweser, Bob Chakales, and Clint Courtney on December 6. In , Marsh played in 89 games, collecting 66 hits in 303 at-bats for a .218 average. He showed a great eye at the plate that year, walking 35 times while striking out only 33 times. He missed nearly half of the season with a broken elbow and a leg injury. would end up being his final big league season. He collected only three hits in 24 at-bats that year, for a .125 average. He played his final game on May 29 of that year. Overall, Marsh hit .239 in 465 games in his career. He collected 296 hits in 1236 at-bats, with 43 of those hits being doubles, eight of them triples and 10 of them home runs. He scored 146 runs and drove in 96. He was a good basestealer in terms of percentage, as he was only caught once in 14 attempts – a 92.9% success rate. He had a good eye at the plate as well, walking 125 times and striking out only 171 times. He had a .948 career fielding percentage. Statistically, the player he is most similar to is Ken Hamlin. After his baseball career, he spent many years as a postal carrier. After his death in Corry, Pennsylvania at the age of 82, he was buried at Pine Grove Cemetery in Corry. ==ReferencesExternal links== *BaseballLibrary * Category:1924 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:St. Louis Browns players Category:Washington Senators (1901–1960) players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from Illinois Category:United States Navy sailors Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:People from Valley Falls, Kansas Category:Elizabethton Betsy Red Sox players ","title":"Fred Marsh"},{"id":"12352855","text":"Phenatoma rosea, or the pink tower shell, is a species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Borsoniidae.WoRMS (2009).

The foods it prepared were made on-site from fresh ingredients, including its french fries which were sliced and cooked to order. Unlike other major competitors in the hamburger fast food restaurant business (Burger King, McDonald's and Wendy's), as the chain expanded over the years, it has not added products such as chicken or salads to its menu since 1976 and has never changed its preparation methods. The company utilizes a vertical integration model for its raw ingredients, procuring and manufacturing much of its food supplies in-house. The company does not utilize freezers in its operations, shipping food daily to its stores from its facilities. Instead of a broad menu like other competitors, In-N-Out has become known for its \\"secret menu\\", or unadvertised variations of its burgers that are based on customer preferences, such as the popular \\"Animal Style.\\" == Burgers == Animal-style cheeseburger, fries, drink All burgers consist of zero (in the case of a 'grilled cheese') or more beef patties cooked to \\"medium-well\\", and served on a toasted bun. The standard style of burger includes tomato, hand-leafed lettuce and \\"spread\\", a sauce similar to Thousand Island dressing.  Meat  For most of its history, In-N-Out has produced its own meat in company-owned facilities. The chain has a policy of using only fresh meat, and all of its stores are supplied by its California manufacturing operations located in Baldwin Park. With its expansion into Texas, the restaurant opened its first production plant outside of California in a suburb of Dallas in order to increase its geographic footprint. By keeping the manufacturing process in house, the chain is able to maintain strict quality control standards. Beginning in March 2016 the company announced that it would move forward to sourcing its beef from cows that have not been treated with antibiotics. The chain did not announce a timeframe for the switch, but that it would move forward at an expedited pace. Part of the reason for the switch was that California passed a series of laws to ban the use of antibiotics in non-medical, prophylactic treatments. Additionally, several groups of consumer advocacy NGOs, led by CalPIRG, had been pressuring a number of restaurant chains to stop using meat raised with low-dose antibiotics.  Secret menu variations  The bulk of the secret menu revolves around the burgers. In-N-Out's own website acknowledges the existence of this secret menu, publicizing \\"some of the most popular items\\" on what it calls the company's \\"not-so-secret menu.\\" \\"Animal Style\\" is one of the most popular \\"secret\\" styles; in addition to the standard toppings, Animal Style burgers include mustard fried onto each meat patty, pickles, grilled onions, and extra spread. \\"3×3\\" (pronounced 3-by-3), \\"4×4\\", or variations of \\"m\\" × \\"c\\", refers to a burger with a varied amount of meat patties, \\"m\\", and slices of cheese, \\"c\\": e.g. a burger with six meat patties and three slices of cheese is a \\"6×3\\". The In-N-Out \\"secret menu\\" section of the website only mentions the \\"3×3\\" and \\"4×4\\", which are registered trademarks of the company. Until 2004, In-N-Out accommodated burger orders of any size by adding patties and slices of cheese at an additional cost. However, on October 31, 2004, a group of friends ordered a 100×100 from a location in Las Vegas, Nevada, posting photos on the web of the burger. Once word got out of the incredibly large sandwich, In-N-Out management disallowed any sandwich larger than a 4x4. In-N-Out has two low carbohydrate offerings. \\"Protein Style\\", introduced in the 1970s, replaces the bun with large leaves of lettuce; while the \\"Flying Dutchman\\" is a 2x2 with no bun, no vegetables, and no spread with the cheese slices placed between both patties. Health.com rated the protein-style sandwich as the best low-carb sandwich in the United States.  Onion styles  In-N-Out's burger customization offers customers a choice of six different onion styles – three variations of the two ways that onions can be cut (sliced versus chopped). *With onion or chopped onion – standard placement, onion is put on top of the meat/cheese as the burger is cooking. *Raw onion or raw chopped onion – onion is cold and more crisp, placed on top of the spread. *Whole grilled onion or grilled onion – onions are grilled until brown, placed on top of meat. == French fries == An In-N-Out employee preparing potatoes for its french fries In-N-Out uses the Kennebec variety of potato for its fries and prepares them on-site as opposed to purchasing them pre-made from other companies. The company's french fries are cooked in \\"100% pure, cholesterol- free sunflower oil.\\" Fries can also be cooked to order, with cooking times ranging from \\"light\\" to \\"extra well done\\". == Beverages == The company offers lemonade, unsweetened iced tea (though sweet tea is available at Texas stores only), coffee, three flavors of milk shakes (chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry) which can be mixed in any combination desired, and soda. In-N-Out serves soda from two different companies. It serves Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke, and Barq's Famous Olde Tyme Root Beer from the Coca-Cola Company, and 7 Up and Dr Pepper from the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.

It is operated by the Greek Ministry of Culture (Ephorate of Antiquities of Phocis). Founded in 1903, it has been rearranged several times and houses the discoveries made at the Panhellenic sanctuary of Delphi, which date from the Late Helladic (Mycenean) period to the early Byzantine era. Organised in fourteen rooms on two levels, the museum mainly displays statues, including the famous Charioteer of Delphi, architectural elements, like the frieze of the Siphnian Treasury and ex votos dedicated to the sanctuary of Pythian Apollo, like the Sphinx of Naxos. The exhibition floor space is more than 2270m2, while the storage and conservation rooms (mosaics, ceramics and metals) take up 558m2. Visitors are also catered to by an entrance hall, a cafeteria and a gift shop.Museum, outline on the website of the Greek Ministry of Culture == History of the museum == Interior of the museum  First museum  A first, rather small museum was inaugurated on 2 May 1903 to celebrate the end of the first great archaeological campaign of French excavations and to exhibit the findings. The building was designed by the French architect Albert Tournaire, financed by a trust established by the Greek banker and philanthropist Andreas Syngros. Two wings framed a small central building. The arrangement of the collection, designed by the director of the archaeological expedition, Théophile Homolle, was inspired by the view that the architectural parts and sculptures should be put \\"in context\\". Thus, parts of the main monuments of the site were reconstructed with plaster. Yet, the exhibits took every inch of available space, making the exhibition look pretty crammed. Furthermore, the museographic approach lacked any chronological or thematic arrangement. The quality of the exhibits themselves was thought to be self- explanatory. The first exhibition was thus destined more to the pleasure of the eyes than to any educational purpose. Subsequent phases Despite the admiration it inspired to the Greek and international community, already in the 1930s the museum was becoming too small to accommodate new findings or the increasing number of tourists. In addition, its arrangement (or, rather, the absence of it) and the plaster restorations were being increasingly criticized. Finally, its entire appearance was criticized as a little too \\"French\\" in a period which insisted on \\"Greekness.\\" The construction of a new building was launched in 1935. The new museum was representative of the architectural trends of the Interwar period and was accomplished in 1939, including a new arrangement of the objects by the Professor of Archaeology at Thessaloniki, Constantinos Romaios. The reorganisation of the Archaic collections was entrusted to the French archaeologist Pierre de La Coste- Messelière, who discarded the plaster restorations of significant artefacts, including that of the Siphnian Treasury, which had become one of the principal attractions. The antiquities were presented in a chronological order, listed and labelled. However, this arrangement was only briefly in use. The outbreak of World War II constituted a major threat to the antiquities which were put into storage. Part was kept at Delphi in the ancient Roman tombs or in specially dug pits in front of the museum. The most precious objects (the chryselephantine objects, the silver Statue of a Bull discovered three months before the outbreak of war, and the Charioteer were sent to Athens in order to be stored in the vaults of the Bank of Greece. They remained there for ten years. The charioteer was on display in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens until 1951. The region of Delphi was at the heart of the combat zone in the Greek civil war and the museum was not reopened until 1952. For six years, visitors could view the arrangement that had been envisioned in 1939. However, the museum proved insufficient and it was necessary to undertake a new phase of construction, completed in 1958. The renovation of the museum was entrusted to the architect Patroklos Karantinos and the archaeologist Christos Karouzos was sent from the National Archaeological Museum of Athens to rearrange the collection, under the supervision of the ephor of Delphi, Ioanna Constantinou. Karatinos created two new exhibition halls and modified the structure to allow more natural light into the building. The arrangement of the collection remained chronological, but a greater focus was placed on the sculpture, with statues increasingly separated from their architectural contexts. The museum reopened its doors in 1961. and soon became one of the most visited tourist attractions in Greece: in 1998, it received more than 300,200 visitors, almost as many as the National Archaeological Museum of Athens in the same period (325,000 visitors).  Current Museum  Reconstruction of the Sanctuary of Apollo, Delphi. Between 1999 and 2003, the museum underwent yet another phase of renovations, carried out by the Greek architect Alexandros Tombazis. These included the construction of a new facade in a contemporary style and a new hall for the charioteer. The rest of the museum was re-designed in a modern style and adjusted to facilitate the circulation of visitors. A new lobby, a large cafeteria and a gift shop were also created. The collection was rearranged in order to reconcile the need to display the main attractions of the museum effectively and the wish to present the latest theories and discoveries of archaeological and historical scholarships. An effort was also made to illustrate hitherto neglected exhibits like the classical facade of the Temple of Apollo. The museum opened its doors once more for its centenary. == Collections == The collections of the Delphi Archaeological Museum are arranged chronologically in fourteen rooms.  Rooms 1 & 2  The first two rooms are devoted to the most ancient objects. The exhibition starts with Mycenaean finds, particularly clay figurines, among which a significant female figure seated on a three-legged chair, which has been viewed as a precursor of the later tripods. The majority of the exhibits, however, are bronze votive offerings, dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC, including bronze tripods and cauldrons with decorative elements inspired by mythical creatures, such as griffins, as well as bronze figurines of warriors. The items displayed date to the late Geometric and early Archaic periods.

It also contains the metopes of the Treasury of the Sicyonians.Grèce continentale. Guide bleu., . The latter include four metopes made of yellowish porous stone from Sicyon, coming from the so-called \\"monopteros\\". They depict scenes from the Argonautic expedition, a scene from the myth of the Dioskouroi abducting the oxen of Arkadias aided by their cousins, Idas and Lyngeus, some scenes from the hunt of the Calydonian boar and, finally, the scene of the abduction of Europe by Zeus transformed into a bull. Some bronze figurines of the 6th century BC are also displayed in the same room, of which notable is a figurine of Apollo, made by a Laconian workshop. On one of the cases fastened against the wall is displayed a bronze tile depicting a scene from the Odyssey: a man, possibly Ulysses, tied under the belly of a ram is possibly escaping from the cave of Polyphemus; another tile depicts Hercules carrying the Erymanthian boar to king Eurystheus, who hides in a jar, terrified. Finally, simae from two archaic treasuries are also displayed; they are made of terracotta and are decorated with rosettes and spiral motifs.

Room 4  This is dedicated to the very precious offerings found in an pit on the Sacred Way: the silver Statue of a Bull and the chryselephantine statues which are thought to represent the Apollonian triad, namely Apollo, Artemis and their mother, Leto.

Room 5  This room displays the Sphinx of Naxos and the friezes of the Siphnian Treasury.Grèce continentale. Guide bleu., . The parts of the treasury displayed include one of the two Korae, i.e. the elegant female figures supporting the vestibule of the treasury, one of the capitals and parts of the frieze. The eastern part of the frieze presents scenes related to the Trojan war, such as the convention of the gods, a battle scene in front of Troy (eastern frieze), a Gigantomachy (northern frieze), the judgement of Paris (western frieze) and the abduction of a woman (southern frieze), identified either with the abduction of Hippodameia by Pelops or with that of the daughters of Leukippos by the Dioskouroi. The sculptures of the pediment of the treasury are also extant, depicting the fief between Hercules and Apollo for the possession of the Delphic tripod. The most impressive exhibit, however, is the Sphinx. It is an enormous statue which crowned an ionic column and capital, totaling 12 meters in height. The column stood close to the Halos. The Sphinx was dedicated by the city of Naxos, a wealthy island of the Aegean in its prime time, i.e. between 575 and 560 BC. An inscription at the base of the column renews the right of \\"promanteia\\" for Naxos in the 4th century BC.

Guide bleu., . The archaic sculptures, made of Parian marble, include a carriage with four horses, carrying Apollo. To the left of the carriage stood three female figures, possibly the daughters of Kekrops, king of Athens, and to the right three male figures. The scene is identified as the advent of Apollo to Delphi. The central acroterion of the temple depicted a victory (Nike) running with her knee lifted up in the air. The two side acroteria depicted Sphinxes. The western pediment sculptures depicted a Gigantomachy. Both pediments are attributed to the Athenian sculptor Antenor. The sculptures of the pediments of the 4th century temple were made of Pentelic marble. On the eastern pediment Apollo was seated on a tripod, flanked by Leto, ARtemis and the Muses. On the western pediment was depicted Dionysus, surrounded by female figures, the Thyades. Both pediments are attributed to the sculptors Praxias and Androsthenes.

Guide bleu., . The two pediments of the Treasury of the Athenians are fragmentary and depict, apparently, the meeting of Theseus and Peirithus (eastern pediment) and Hercules in a battle scene (western pediment). Twenty-seven out of the thirty metopes of the treasury are also preserved. They bear representations in deep relief. The east side metopes depict an Amazonomachy. The south side metopes depict the heroic deeds of Theseus, such as the killing of the Minotaur, the bull of Marathon, the hero with an amazon, the hero with the goddess Athena, the fight against the bandit Cercyon and against Skiron. On the north side are depicted nine heroic deeds of Hercules, such as the fight against Geryones, in four consequent metopes, in an unusual \\"narrative\\" style.

Among them stand out sculptures from the Treasury of the Massaliots and the Doric Treasury. Two acroteria in the form of running female figures have been attributed to the temple of Athena. Architectural members on the north wall of the room such as simae, gutters in the form of lion-head and acroteria in the form of anthemia, as well as parts of Nike acroteria belong also to various buildings of the sanctuary, date to the late archaic and classical periods and preserve traces of their initial colours. In the middle of the room there are free-standing cases, in which are displayed three bronze figurines, namely a Corinthian figurine of a man playing the double flute (460–450 BC), two naked athletes dated to the same period and coming from an Attic workshop, and a magnificent bronze incense-burner in the form of a \\"peplophoros\\", a female figure holding above her head a cauldron for burning the incense. All three figurines were found in the pit of the Sacred Way along with the chryselephantine statues and several other finds. Along the western side there is a case displaying bronze figurines dated to the first half of the 5th century BC, as well as parts of larger bronze statues. Among the latter stand out the part of a crane and the part of a himation decorated with maeander motifs with inlay copper. Room 10, on the other hand, contains parts of the Tholos of Delphi, the round building standing out in the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia, dated to the first quarter of the 4th century BC. Two rows of simae with lion-heads and two rows of metopes have been found. The first row of metopes decorated the external side and the row with the smaller figures belonged to the internal side of the pteron. The sculpted decoration was complete with acroteria in the form of women dressed in floating peplos. The outer metopes depicted an Amazonomachy and a Centauromachy. The sculptures of the Tholos date to 380–370 BC and constitute magnificent specimens of late Classical sculpture, reminding of the sculptures of the Asclepeion of Epidaurus. Unfortunately, several of them had been damaged in Late Antiquity. File:Bronze-sculptur-crop.jpgBronze sculptures of the 5th century BC  Room 11  The room contains Late Classical and early Hellenistic objects, among which the Dancers of Delphi and the ex voto of Daochos. Daochos II was the tetrarch of Thessaly between 336 and 332 BC. The ex voto consisted of a rectangular base 11 meters long which bore openings for supporting nine statues, discovered around it. Eight of the statues were identified by inscriptions. From right to left were depicted possibly a seated Apollo, next to him Acnonios, former tetrarch of Thessaly, with his three sons, Agias, Telemachus and Agelaus, victors in various athletic games, then Daochos I, Daochos II and finally Sisyphus II, the latter's son. Some of the figures, at least, have been attributed to Lysippus. The Dancers of Delphi on the other hand, is a column identified due to the inscription of its base. It was dedicated by the Athenians, made of Pentelic marble. The column ended in a composition consisting of acanthus leaves out of which sprang three female figures with their hands lifted, as if dancing. They probably held a tripod (not extant) crowned by the omphalos displayed also in the same room. Among the other important exhibits of the room counts a statue of Apollo in the Patroos type and the statue of a man wearing the himation, dated to the 5th century BC as well as the statue of an aged man with a himation leaving the right shoulder and the breast uncovered, identified as a priest of Apollo or as a philosopher and dated to 280 BC.

The main exhibit of the statue of Antinous, protégé of the emperor Hadrian; it is probably one of the best specimens of the depictions of the young man which were erected all over the Roman Empire after his untimely death under order of the emperor. Close to Antinous stands a head of a man probably depicting Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the Roman general who conquered Delphi in 198 BC. In the middle of the room stands a round altar made of Pentelic marble and coming from the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia. It is decorated in three bands with cyma recta and astragalus patterns and twelve female figures. It dates to the 2nd century BC. Another important exhibit is the pedestal with the frieze in relief constituting the Monument of Aemilius Paullus. Along the south side of the room are displayed parts of the Roman frieze decorating the theatre. They consist of depictions of scenes from the life and deeds of Hercules, such as the garden of the Hesperids, Cerberus, the lion of Nemea, a Centaur, Antaeus, the belt of Hippolyte, the horses of Diomedes etc. File:Antinous Delphi.jpgAntinous, Parian marble, time of Hadrian File:07Delphi Fabius.jpgBust of the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus File:Estauta Plutarcu en Delfu.jpgStatue of a philosopher, said to be Plutarch or Plato  Room 13  This is the room of the Charioteer.Grèce continentale.

There are displayed three marble heads: a head of hercules dated possibly to the 1st century AD, the head of a philosopher of Late Antiquity, dated to the 4th century AD and a head of a priest or philosopher dated to the 2nd century AD. In the past it had been identified as a head of Plutarch. A hermaic stele nearby bears an dedicatory inscription to Plutarch and it probably held a head statue of the ancient author, but the latter has unfortunately not been preserved.

File:Heracles-1.jpgMarble of bearded head said to be Hercules. ==The ground floor gallery== The ground floor room contains finds from the necropolis of Delphi, from houses, from the Corycian cave as well as several other finds of unidentified origin. Three funerary stelae stand right next to the entrance; they bear depictions of the deceased in relief. The first case contains Mycenaean stirrup jars and the next one various types of Mycenaean pottery from the Mycenaean settlement. Hand-made and wheel-made pottery (11th–9th century BC) are also extant, coming from a chamber tomb discovered at the site of the museum. In the case at the opposite side of the room is displayed pottery, of which stands out a group of pottery from the so-called \\"Corinthian house\\" dated to 625–600 BC. In the next case are displayed seals and scarabs of Egyptian style. In a free standing case in the middle of the room is displayed a bronze hydria with depiction in relief, a rather rare vessel of a workshop locate in the north Peloponnese. Burial votive offerings are exhibited in the next case, including belt buckles, aryballoi and incense bottles. Classical period pottery follows. A large clay bust of Demeter or Persephone along with several other clay vessels come from the so-called \\"grave of the priest\\". In the next case are exhibited grave goods from a grave located around the museum, dated to the first half of the 4th century BC. Two attic lekythoi with depictions in relief, clay figurines of Aphrodite, a dancer, Cassandra, a comic actor as well as a doll with movable hands and legs count among the most important exhibits. The long case along the narrow wall contains finds from the Corycian cave, such as two vessels of the late Neolithic period, some human clay figurines, obsidian blades and some of the knuckle bones discovered there. Some figurines depict korae (young women) and animals. The most impressive exhibit, however, is a chorus of the Muses around Pan. In the rest of the cases are displayed black-figured lekythoi, clay figurines, a rather large figurine of Aphrodite and a folding mirror decorated with the head of the same goddess. Finally, some Late antique exhibits such as oil-lamps and a leopard made of mother-of-pearl offer a glimpse into the city of Delphi in Late Antiquity. == See also == * Delphi * List of museums in Greece == References External links== * Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism * Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs * Delphi Archaeological Museum - Ebook by Latsis Foundation (select THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF DELPHI) * ancient-greece.org * www.greece-museums.com * www.planetware.com Category:1903 establishments in Greece Category:Museums established in 1903 Category:Buildings and structures in Phocis ","title":"Delphi Archaeological Museum"},{"id":"12352970","text":"Bar with pointed and blunt end A digging bar is a long, straight metal bar used for various purposes, including as a post hole digger, to break up or loosen hard or compacted materials such as soil, rock, concrete and ice or as a lever to move objects. Known by other names depending on locale, structural features and intended purpose such as a hop bar or crowbar in Britain, Australia and New Zealand,DeLaRonde, Joe. Blacksmithing basics for the homestead. Layton, Utah: Gibbs Smith, Publisher, 2008. Print. 104. and slate bar, shale bar, spud bar, pinch point bar or San Angelo bar in North America, or just a bar. In Hawaii, a similar, traditional wooden device known as an ‘o‘o stick is used as a digging bar in groundbreaking ceremonies. Not to be confused with a curved crowbar, which is designed to provide leverage rather than to dig. ==Uses== Using digging bars to move rocks Common uses of digging bars include breaking up clay, concrete, frozen ground, and other hard materials, moving or breaking up tree roots and obstacles, and making holes in the ground for fence posts. They are often used where space would not allow the use of a pickaxe. ==Materials and construction== The ends of a digging bar are shaped for various purposes.Griffith, Nathan. Husbandry: the surest, cheapest way to leisure, plenty prosperity, and contentment, plainly illustrated. Trout Valley, W. Va.: Cobblemead Publications, 1998. 30. Print. Typically, each end has a different shape so as to provide two different tool functions in one tool. Common end shapes include: * Blunt — a broad, blunt surface for tamping. * Point — for breaking hard materials and prying. * Wedge — an unsharpened blade for digging, breaking and prying. A San Angelo bar has a wedge at one end. * Chisel — a sharpened blade for cutting roots, digging and prying. A pinch point bar has a chisel at one end. Bars are typically long and weigh . They are usually made entirely of cylindrical or hexagonal forged steel with a diameter of approximately . Chisel and wedge ends typically have a blade width measuring . Blunt ends typically have a diameter of . ==Variants== Bark spud Log-peeling spuds are used to remove the bark from logs. These spuds typically have a wooden or steel handle of length to over . This tool is also called a Bark spud or a barking iron.Dunster, Julian A., and Katherine Jane Dunster. Dictionary of natural resource management. Vancouver, BC: UBC Press, 1996. Print. Hop bar A hop bar (also Hop pitcher) is used to make holes in the ground for hop poles, or more long with a heavy, bulbous spike at the digging end. Ice spud Fishing through holes in ice is common in many parts of the world. One of the earliest methods of cutting these holes was to use a device variously known as an ice spud or ice chisel. Many chisel variations exist, including jagged teeth, skewed edges, and different grind angles and chisel widths. Early ice spuds (before about 1925) often had wooden handles and a steel chisel fixed with a tang and collar or socket, similar to a carpenter's chisel. Ice spuds are still carried by many ice fishermen as a means to test ice thickness and safety; a single forceful thrust of the ice spud will often penetrate unsafe ice. Lining bar A lining bar is used to shift the alignment of railroad tracks, to manipulate some types of railroad track jacks, to \\"nip up\\" or lift ties and rails, and as a digging tool. Lining bars have a tapered form. They often have a square cross section between one and 1-1/2 inches at one end. They may have a pyramidal, wedge, or pinch point. They transition to a tapered round cross section 12 to 18 inches from the point. The handle end may terminate in a ball or may be cut off squarely at 5/8 to 3/4 inch diameter. They are made of forged steel and may be from five to six feet long. Lining bars may also be called jack bars, jack handles, or crowbars in North American railroad jargon. Spud bar A spud bar has a chisel at one end that is intended for removing material through a chipping or shaving action. In the British Isles these typically have a narrow, unsharpened chisel point at one end and a point at the other end, with diameters up to about. Some have plastic grips on the shaft and some have wider chisel ends, or \\"rakes\\", for specific jobs such as removing old shingles and tar paper.

She debuted in the entertainment scene as a Miss Korea runner-up in 1989 and went on to star in Hourglass (1995), one of the highest-rated and critically acclaimed dramas in Korean television history. She retired after marrying chaebol Chung Yong- jin in 1995, then returned to acting after their divorce in 2003. Go has since regained her top star status in Korea, becoming the highest-paid actress on TV after the success of her series Queen Seondeok (2009) and Daemul.\\"10LINE: Ko Hyun-jung\\". 10Asia. November 3, 2009. ==Life and career== Early career and retirement Go Hyun-jung graduated from Dongguk University with a degree in Performing Arts. She was a runner-up in the Miss Korea pageant in 1989, which launched her acting career. Her big break came in the 1995 SBS drama Sandglass. The drama dealt with modern Korean history from 1970 to the 1990s and was one of the highest rated dramas in Korean television history, with average ratings of 50.8% and a peak of 64.5%. People would rush home just to see a new episode, saying “it's time to go home,” which meant they had to go home to watch Sandglass.\\"Resilient actress relishes dramatic return\\" . Korea JoongAng Daily. November 4, 2010 However, following her marriage, Go announced her retirement from the industry. Television comeback and films She staged a comeback in the 2005 melodrama Spring Day, which she followed up with May–December romantic comedy What's Up Fox? and police procedural H.I.T. Not content with her small screen success, Go began her late-blooming movie career by going against her image and taking pay cuts to star in non-mainstream films. She was part of the ensemble cast in arthouse films Woman on the Beach and Like You Know It All by auteur Hong Sang-soo.\\"해변의 연인 (The Woman on The Beach) Presentation Report\\". Twitch Film. April 17, 2006. She then starred in Actresses, a semi-improvisational movie featuring six actresses each playing themselves. Director E J-yong, who was first inspired to make the film after going out for a drink with actresses Youn Yuh-jung and Go in 2007, said he focused on conveying the \\"reality\\" of the actresses' lives.\\"Fact and fiction merge as South Korea's leading ladies come together\\".

That same year, Go surprised fans not only by appearing on a TV entertainment show (popular talk show Golden Fishery hosted by comedian Kang Ho-dong) for the first time in 15 years, but also by very frankly addressing rumors surrounding her shrouded personal life. Once notorious for declining to appear on entertainment programs other than dramas or films, she maintained a mysterious image for a long time. Her new easy-going, and down-to-earth attitude seemingly reflected a philosophical view of the many ups and downs in life. In interviews with print and online magazines, Go has even expressed her feelings towards her ex-husband and children.\\"Actress Ko Reveals Truth About Rumors\\". The Korea Times. January 22, 2009. Twenty-one years after making her acting debut, Go held her very first fanmeeting on June 13, 2010—she held a press conference beforehand, sang songs for the 500 fans present, answered questions, and prepared video clips.

Go returned to television in 2013 with The Queen's Classroom, a remake of the 2005 Japanese drama Jyoou no Kyoushitsu. The story depicts the struggle between a ferocious and ruthless elementary school teacher and her class. In 2016, Go starred in the family melodrama Dear My Friends, playing a freelance translator, a complex and sometimes abrasive character, who observes the lives of the old people surrounding her. In 2017, Go announced her return to the big screen with A Winter Guest Scarier than a Tiger, by acclaimed indie filmmaker Lee Kwang-kuk. In 2018, Go starred in the legal thriller drama Return. The drama revolves around a murder case that involves powerful members of an elite class, with Go playing the role of a rags-to-riches lawyer with secrets. However halfway through the series, it was announced that she dropped out due to irreconcilable differences with the PD. Go is set to star in the second season of My Lawyer, Mr. Jo, which will premiere in 2019. ==Other activities== In 2010, after her contract ended with De Chocolate E&TF;, she set up her own talent agency with her brother Go Byung-cheol as CEO, called IOK Company. In 2012, Spring Day costar and close friend Jo In-sung also signed on. She published a book on skin care titled Go Hyun-jung's Texture in 2011. The actress has always been admired for her youthful appearance, largely attributable to her young and healthy skin which had made fans wonder about her beauty secrets. The book, arranged in the format of a documentary, contains Go's own philosophy on beauty classified under six themes—texture, color, light, line, formality and scent—as well as her ideas on leading a sound and healthy lifestyle in general. The book is co-written by another writer who observed the actress's everyday life for six months, describing it in detail.\\"Actress' skin care secret: Don't fret\\" . Korea JoongAng Daily. April 27, 2011.\\"Actress Ko Hyun-jung publishes book on skin care\\". 10Asia. April 25, 2011.

I want to meet a lot of people and hear their stories. I have always wanted to do that and SBS gave me that opportunity.\\" Given her reputation for saying what is on her mind (one that has won the actress many fans), concerns arose as to how her work as show host would affect the impressive image of flawless elegance and sophistication she has gained over the years. But Go harbored little anxiety over how her public image might change, saying, \\"I think I can afford to put a small dent in my image and have some fun.\\"\\"Ko Hyeon-jeong says hosting own show not a cakewalk\\". The Korea Herald. March 28, 2012. Co-hosted by singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin, and comedians Jung Hyung-don and Kim Young-chul, the talk show was cancelled after eight months on the air. In 2014, she began teaching acting at her alma mater Dongguk University, as an adjunct professor in the theater department. Back in 2006, she donated a scholarship fund to the school. Go also launched her own fashion brand, atti.k, a label that sells clothes, shoes, and bags. In the following year, Go then launched her own cosmetics line, koY. In 2015, Go starred in her own reality show, which tracks her trip to Tokyo and films her preparation to launch her travel book. ==Personal life== In May 1995, at the peak of her career, Go married Chung Yong-jin, vice chairman and CEO of Shinsegae Group and grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chull. The two first met in New York purely by coincidence when Chung had offered to help Go find her seat at the Winter Garden Theatre because her English was so bad.\\"Rich husbands wanted, with nice homes abroad\\" . Korea JoongAng Daily. April 24, 2007.

The Korea Times. January 22, 2009. They had two children together, a boy (born in 1998) and a girl (born in 2000). After eight years of marriage, a messy divorce followed in November 2003, during which she lost complete custody of her children. Two years after the divorce, Shinsegae passed down a ruling stating that none of its department stores would be allowed to display any Go-related material, including any of her product endorsements. ==Filmography==  Television series  {  - ! width=10Year !

Although the band's origins trace back to 2002, Divine Heresy was officially formed in 2006. The band currently consists of guitarist Cazares, former Vital Remains drummer and current World Under Blood drummer Tim Yeung, former Nile bassist Joe Payne and vocalist Travis Neal. Tommy \\"Vext\\" Cummings was fired from Divine Heresy following an onstage altercation on April 26, 2008. After holding auditions for a new frontman for the band, it was announced on August 14 that The Bereaved vocalist Travis Neal is to fill the position. The band's debut album Bleed the Fifth was released on August 28, 2007, and sold 2,700 copies in its first week. Receiving generally positive reviews, Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic commented the album \\"strikes a near-perfect balance between confirmation and innovation\\", while Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer commented \\"All in all, the portly pioneer [Cazares] has hit the bull's-eye\\". ==History== Formation (2002–2007) Following his departure from Fear Factory in 2002, guitarist Dino Cazares was looking for a drummer that \\"fit in\\" with the band. First he tried drummers John Sankey from Devolved and Nicholas Barker from the bands Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. But both drummers had to return to their homelands of Australia and England respectively due to visa issues. He then met former Vital Remains drummer Tim Yeung. Cazares and Yeung recorded the material they wrote and sent tapes to Cummings for his vocal audition. Cazares comments \\"We heard passion and anger in his voice, which was something we wanted. It was also very aggressive.\\" Divine Heresy held auditions for a permanent bassist — Tony Campos of Static-X played bass on three songs and Cazares acted as bassist on the remaining songs. Following unsuccessful auditions, Cazares was contacted by former Nile bassist Joe Payne. Cazares knew Joe Payne from seeing him play live with Nile. After auditioning, Joe Payne joined Divine Heresy as the permanent bass guitarist. Bleed the Fifth (2007–2008) The band recorded its debut album, Bleed the Fifth in early 2007 with production duties handled by former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader. The title of the album is a play on words, Cazares comments \\"You have the right to keep your mouth shut, but on this record we believe we’re saying a lot\\". Cummings wrote the majority of the lyrics, which are about personal strifes and how people overcome them. Much of the lyrical content was influenced by the Book of Revelation, natural disasters, war, and terrorism. Cazares stated the album is a \\"big fuck you\\" to the people who want his projects to fail. Released on August 28, 2007, in the United States, Bleed the Fifth sold 2,700 copies in its first week. Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer summarized his review by saying \\"All in all, the portly pioneer has hit the bull's-eye and it's going to be fascinating to see what happens next\\", awarding an 8 out of a possible 10. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic felt the album \\"strikes a near-perfect balance between confirmation (reminding fans of Cazares' abilities and unique vision) and innovation (he even plays a few guitar solos!)\\". Scott Alisoglu of Blabbermouth.net summarized his review claiming the album is \\"one tough son of a bitch that may still have you humming melodies long after you've ejected the disc.\\" Chad Bowar of About.com commented \\"Great musicianship, good songs and excellent production make this a very respectable debut.\\" After recording was completed, Cazares announced the band signed a North American deal with Century Media Records, and a licensing deal with Roadrunner Records in Europe. His decision to choose Century Media was based on the creative freedom the label gave him, whereas Roadrunner would ask him to produce radio and commercial songs when he was in Fear Factory. However, Yeung claims Roadrunner were not interested and said he did not want to be on a label that is \\"sort of interested\\". Departure of Tommy Vext (2008) Lead singer Tommy Vext left the band following an on-stage altercation on April 26, 2008. Cause of the altercation remains controversial. According to Dino Cazares, Vext was fired because of a conflict during a live show. \\"We felt that he wanted to end the show early to go hang out at the New England Metal Fest, which we were supposed to be performing at the next day\\" coming up with all sorts of excuses to make this happen. The band continued to play after what Vext said was supposed to be the last song. Vext then began screaming at Dino and argued with him before he pushed Dino across the stage. Vext was kicked out of the band immediately. In a video interview Vext explained that he wanted to prevent ruining his voice for the next show by ending the set early because the PA system went out during the show. In exclusive \\"Metal Injection\\" interview Tommy explained the real reasons behind his departure from the band: Bringer of Plagues and hiatus (2009–2015) Divine Heresy's follow-up to 2007's Bleed the Fifth was the group's first release with new vocalist Travis Neal, formerly of Pushed. He is also currently a member of the Swedish band The Bereaved and the band Hate Times Nine from San Diego/LA. The album, titled Bringer of Plagues, was released on July 28 release via Century Media Records. Dino co-produced the album with the acclaimed producing team Dirty Icon (Logan Mader and Lucas Banker). As of November 25, 2010, Divine Heresy cannot be found on the Century Media Records website. Dino has also given interviews that during breaks from the current Fear Factory tour, Dino and drummer Tim Yeung have started writing new material for the next Divine Heresy record. On January 26, 2011, it was announced that bassist Joe Payne had left Divine Heresy. On 10 May 2011, Dino announced via Divine Heresy's Facebook page and through his own personal account that Divine Heresy are still together and that there will be a new album in 2012. He also said that they were planning a tour along the US east coast. On August 17, 2012, guitarist Dino Cazares via Twitter commented on the status of Tim Yeung as a DH drummer: On July 27, 2015, in an interview with MetalSucks, Cazares confirmed that he is the only remaining member of Divine Heresy and the band is currently inactive due to his commitments with Fear Factory. ==Band members== Current members * Dino Cazares – guitars (2005–present), bass (2007) Former members * Jose Maldanado – vocals (2005) * John Sankey – drums (2005) * Tim Yeung – drums (2006–2012) * Tommy Vext – vocals (2006–2008) * Joe Payne – bass, backing vocals (2007–2011; died 2020) * Travis Neal – vocals (2008–2013) Live members * Risha Eryavec – bass (2006–2007) * Jake Veredika – vocals (2008) Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:120 bottom:60 top:0 right:15 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/2005 till:10/23/2015 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2005 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2005 Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:lines value:black legend:Studio_Albums LineData = at:08/25/2007 color:black layer:back at:07/28/2009 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Maldanado text:\\"Jose Maldanado\\" bar:Vext text:\\"Tommy Vext\\" bar:Neal text:\\"Travis Neal\\" bar:Cazares text:\\"Dino Cazares\\" bar:Payne text:\\"Joe Payne\\" bar:Sankey text:\\"John Sankey\\" bar:Yeung text:\\"Tim Yeung\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Maldanado from:01/01/2005 till:01/30/2005 color:Vocals bar:Vext from:01/01/2006 till:04/28/2008 color:Vocals bar:Neal from:08/14/2008 till:09/30/2013 color:Vocals bar:Cazares from:01/01/2005 till:end color:Guitar bar:Cazares from:01/01/2005 till:07/01/2007 color:Bass width:2.5 bar:Sankey from:01/01/2005 till:01/30/2005 color:Drums bar:Yeung from:01/01/2006 till:08/17/2012 color:Drums bar:Payne from:07/01/2007 till:01/26/2011 color:Bass ==Discography== * Bleed the Fifth (2007) * Bringer of Plagues (2009) ==Music videos== *Failed Creation – 2007 *Bleed The Fifth (Tommy Vext Version) – 2007 *Bleed The Fifth (Travis Neal Version) – 2008 *Facebreaker – 2009 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Divine Heresy on Myspace Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:Death metal musical groups from California Category:Century Media Records artists Category:American melodic death metal musical groups ","title":"Divine Heresy"},{"id":"12353017","text":"The Associates Triangular Series in South Africa was a One Day International cricket tournament involving the national teams of Canada, Netherlands and Bermuda, held in South Africa. == Points Table == {  !

With the national office located in Austin, Texas, Atticus Circle focuses on straight allies of the LGBT social movements. The organization was founded and is run mostly by straight people and works to empower straight and other allies to give them a sense of ownership in this civil rights struggle. ==History== Atticus Circle, named for Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird, was founded in late 2004 by Anne Wynne after 11 states passed what she considered anti-gay \\"Discrimination Amendments\\". Wynne is straight and noticed the lack of organizations catering to straight allies. Since its inception, Atticus Circle has participated in campaigns in Texas around GLBT domestic partnership benefits and \\"Discrimination Amendments\\". They have advocated against \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policies and for fair family policies. Wynne notes that most gay rights activism is done by gay people, although she finds it a natural issue for straight progressives to support: she says \\"we haven't gotten on their radar yet.\\" In October 2007, the organization ran a national \\"Seven Straight Nights for Equal Rights\\" event, where the straight community could show support for LGBT rights. It was one of the first such events in Austin and in the United States. The event was held again in 2008. ==Projects== January–May, 2007: Atticus Circle formed the \\"Equality Circle\\", a group of straight volunteers in Austin, Texas, who paired with LGBT people to advocate for equal rights during the 2007 Texas Legislative Session.

He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball between 1904 and 1913 for the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies. McCormick also served in the United States Army during World War I and as a civilian director of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Under manager John McGraw of the Giants, he was one of the first pinch hitters in the game's history and was considered one of the best pinch hitters in the game. ==Early life== McCormick's father worked in the Philadelphia Gas Works, while his mother raised their five children. McCormick's father died when he was five years old, making him legally an orphan under Pennsylvania laws, and eligible to attend Girard College. In high school, McCormick excelled in both baseball and American football. He got his nickname from classmates because of his large body size. McCormick graduated from Girard College in 1898, and enrolled at Bucknell University, where he played baseball, American football, basketball, and track and field for the Bucknell Bison. He succeeded future Giants teammate Christy Mathewson as Bucknell's starting fullback. ==Baseball career== Rather than graduating with his class at Bucknell in 1904, he left to play minor league baseball for the Jersey City Skeeters of the Eastern League in 1903. He joined the New York Giants of the National League in Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1904. McCormick was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a three-team trade, with the Pirates sending Jimmy Sebring to the Cincinnati Reds and the Reds sending Mike Donlin to the Giants. After the season, the Pirates traded McCormick to the Philadelphia Phillies with Kitty Bransfield and Otto Krueger for Del Howard. However, McCormick stopped playing baseball, working as a steel salesman for the next three years. McCormick returned to baseball in 1908. After appearing in eleven games for the Phillies, batting .091, the Phillies sold McCormick to the Giants. McGraw decided to use McCormick as a pinch hitter due to his lack of speed. While rounding third base during a game, Cy Seymour, who was coaching third base, tackled McCormick. When Giants manager John McGraw inquired, Seymour made an excuse about having the sun in his eyes. This led McGraw, now realizing the need for a full-time coach, to hire Arlie Latham for the role, the first full- time base coach in MLB.Mathewson, p. 121 McCormick scored the potential winning run in the infamous 1908 Merkle game. The run was eventually nullified, the game ended in a tie, and the Giants lost the pennant by a single game. McCormick again worked as a salesman in 1910 and 1911. He returned to MLB to play for the Giants in 1912 and 1913. He retired after the 1913 season. ==Later life== McCormick managed the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1914 and 1915. He worked for the Hess Steel Company in Baltimore, Maryland after his retirement. In 1917, he enlisted in the United States Army. He fought in France as a first lieutenant and captain in the 167th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division, known as the \\"Rainbow Division\\", during World War I. He then coached the Bucknell Bison baseball team in 1923 through 1925, and the Army Black Knights baseball team in 1928. McCormick remained with the military, serving as a civilian director in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, he served as Bucknell's director of housing.

In 2006, eleven-year-old Poutre awoke from a coma shortly before she was scheduled to be removed from life support. Poutre had a severe brain injury thought to be caused by abuse by her adoptive mother.Boston Herald Court records: Haleigh Poutre ’making statements’ about abuse, February 27, 2008 The case brought about many changes in the Massachusetts Department of Social Services, both in the way they handle reports of child abuse as well as their policies on end-of-life care for children in their custody. ==Background== At the age of four, Haleigh Poutre went to live with her maternal aunt, Holli Strickland, and Strickland's husband Jason, following allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of her mother's boyfriend. In 2001, Holli Strickland alone legally adopted Haleigh. When asked in court why he never legally adopted Haleigh, Jason Strickland replied \\"Honestly, I didn't feel like I needed a piece of paper to say I was her father.\\" ==Injury== On September 11, 2005, Haleigh was taken to the emergency room at Noble Hospital in Westfield, Massachusetts, by Holli and Jason Strickland. They reported to medical staff that she had become unresponsive after suffering from \\"flu-like symptoms\\". Physicians determined that her brain stem was partly sheared, leaving her in a vegetative state. Physicians also noted a number of other injuries including broken teeth, numerous contusions and lacerations on Haleigh's body, and several burns in various stages of healing. On September 20, 2005, the Stricklands were arrested and charged with assault and battery. Holli Strickland was shot to death two days later while out on bond. Police believe her death on September 22, 2005, to be a murder-suicide at the hands of her grandmother, Constance Young. == End of life debate == Following criminal charges, the department of social services took custody of eleven-year-old Poutre. Eight days after she was admitted to the hospital, Harry Spence, the commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Social Services, sought to remove her from life support. Physicians involved in the case asserted that Poutre was in a vegetative state, and \\"virtually brain dead.\\" On October 5, 2005, a judge approved the request. Jason Strickland, Poutre's stepfather, appealed the decision. Although Jason Strickland had never legally adopted Poutre, he asserted his right to make the decision as the de facto parent. Complicating the issue was the criminal case against Jason Strickland. If Poutre died, the state could bring murder charges against Strickland. But if she lived, even in a vegetative state, the charges brought against Strickland were significantly less severe. Many perceived the actions of Strickland to be an attempt at evading homicide charges. On January 17, 2006, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in favor of the Department of Social Services that life support could be removed. On January 18, 2006, Poutre's biological mother indicated Haleigh was responding to her. As physicians were preparing to remove life support, Poutre regained consciousness. In the presence of Harry Spence, social workers asked Poutre to identify a series of items in front of her and she successfully completed the task. The order to remove life support was cancelled. A number of Right to Life groups involved themselves with Poutre's case. They noted parallels between this case and the high profile Terri Schiavo case which had ended in her death earlier that year. Schiavo's family, who runs the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation Center for Health Care Ethics Inc., contacted Mitt Romney regarding the Poutre case. Schiavo's father, Bob Schindler Sr., commented that there have been many similar cases and his foundation's goal is \\"essentially to guard against this rush to judgment.\\" ==Policy changes in response to the case== The Department of Social Services faced harsh criticism for their role in the case. On June 14, 2006, a legislative oversight committee determined that Department of Social Services was at fault for failing to protect Poutre. Department of Social Services officials have acknowledged that they missed signs of abuse before she was brought to the hospital in September. The Department of Social Services received at least twelve reports of abuse or neglect of Poutre between 2001 and 2005. The department had been working with the Strickland family since 1998. The panel recommended a number of changes, including the creation of an audit bureau to review cases, an increase of educational requirements for social workers, and a revamping of abuse reporting systems. In March 2006, Governor Mitt Romney appointed a panel of specialists to evaluate the case. \\"Haleigh's case highlights a frightening confluence of a health care system ignorant of abuse and a child protective system ignorant of medicine,\\" they said. The panel also said current Department of Social Services procedures are \\"substantially insufficient\\" in their ability to make decisions regarding the withdrawal of life support from children in their custody. Recommendations included a number of changes, including increased access to medical, psychiatric, and child abuse expertise, and the creation of a new system for making end-of-life decisions. On July 8, 2008, Governor Deval L. Patrick signed a new law to overhaul the child welfare system in Massachusetts. Changes include a requirement that the case undergo a special review by a state board if the Department of Social Services receives three or more reports of suspected child abuse. The results of that review will then be evaluated by prosecutors and police in the area. A new child-advocate position was also created. This advocate reports directly to the governor regarding severe child abuse or neglect in the state. The new law also involves increased penalties for failing to report child abuse. A new registry for keeping track of foster parents was also implemented. These changes were made largely in response to the Poutre case. ==Criminal case== In 2008, Jason Strickland was tried for the assault. Strickland admitted noticing Poutre's injuries, but claimed he believed Holli's story that the injuries were self inflicted. The story was also believed by the Department of Social Services and was the reason she was not removed from the home despite numerous reports to the agency. During deliberations, jurors questioned whether Jason Strickland had to be present at the time of the assault in order for them to return a guilty verdict. Judge Carhart instructed them that he did not have to be present, but they would have to believe that an \\"ordinary person\\" would have realized that leaving Poutre in the care of Holli Strickland presented a serious risk of bodily harm. Strickland was convicted under this premise. Earlier in the trial, a friend of Holli Strickland's testified that she witnessed Holli push Poutre down the stairs three times in a row as a punishment, each time screaming at her to walk back up before pushing her down them again. Jurors did not believe that Jason Strickland was present for the specific assault that led to Poutre's near fatal injuries, but that he knew the abuse was ongoing. He was also convicted of other charges of assault and battery for striking Poutre himself on previous occasions; he was convicted on the assumption that although Holli was the primary abuser, he failed to stop that abuse. Strickland was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison. ==Poutre's recovery== In 2008, Poutre was released from Brighton rehabilitation hospital to live as a foster child with Keith and Becky Arnett in Southwick, Massachusetts. She was adopted by the Arnetts in 2010 at the age of sixteen and attended a special education program in the Southwick public school system. She remains substantially disabled and relies on a wheelchair, but is able to feed herself and use a letterboard to communicate. Regarding the attack, Poutre's adoptive father reports that she knows she was hurt, but she is unable to remember any specifics about the event. == See also == *Persistent vegetative state *Right to life *Right to die *Traumatic brain injury ==References External links == *MassLive.com Haleigh Poutre index page *DSS sought early end to life support *Judge mulls dismissing charges *Virtually Brain Dead Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People with severe brain damage Category:People from Westfield, Massachusetts Category:Child abuse incidents and cases Category:Child abuse law Category:Child abuse legislation Category:Euthanasia in the United States Category:Child welfare Category:Child welfare activism Category:Medical controversies in the United States Category:People with traumatic brain injuries Category:People with disorders of consciousness Category:People from Southwick, Massachusetts ","title":"Haleigh Poutre"},{"id":"12353107","text":"Clinopodium fasciculatum is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae.

It premiered on the Fox network on January 11, 1998. It was written by Jessica Scott and Mike Wollaeger, directed by Ralph Hemecker, and featured guest appearances by Bob Dawson, Myles Ferguson, Katharine Isabelle, Chad Lindberg, and Sarah-Jane Redmond. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Schizogeny\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 12.9, being watched by 21.37 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to negative reviews, with several critics calling it the worst episode of The X-Files. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully become convinced that a greater evil may be lurking in the community when a teenager is suspected of murdering his stepfather. \\"Schizogeny\\", written by first-year staff writers Scott and Wollaeger, became humorously known as \\"The Killer Tree Episode\\" amongst the cast and crew. Many of the scenes shot for \\"Schizogeny\\" were filmed on a real orchard named Hazelgrove Farms near the small town of Fort Langley, British Columbia. The episode utilized various post-production techniques, in order to clear up vocal issues and to censor one line, which Fox's standards and practices department had issues with. == Plot == In Coats Grove, Michigan, a teenager with anger management issues named Bobby Rich gets into an argument with his stepfather Phil about yard work. Bobby eventually darts into a nearby orchard to evade Phil, but the latter gives chase. Later, Bobby's mother, Patti, enters into the orchard and finds Phil dead, his body almost entirely buried in a mud puddle. A terrified Bobby is next to the body. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate the crime. Scully believes that Bobby killed his stepdad by luring him into a pit trap. Patti repudiates this hypothesis, arguing that when she arrived, it looked like Bobby was trying to help Phil rather than harm him. Mulder and Scully meet with Bobby's therapist, Karin Matthews, who tells them that the boy has been physically abused. Despite the evidence to the contrary, Mulder begins to believe that Bobby is innocent. Later, Bobby meets up with his classmate Lisa Baiocchi. Just like Bobby, Lisa attends therapy sessions with Matthews, as her father, Eugene, is abusive. Bobby tells Lisa that she should not take any more abuse from Eugene. When Lisa returns home, her father angrily tells her to stop seeing Bobby, but suddenly, a mysterious arm-like appendage bursts through the window and yanks him outward. The next day, Scully examines the body and concludes that he was pushed out of a window. Mulder, however, thinks he was pulled out of a second- story window. While examining Eugene's corpse, Mulder finds a splinter in his neck, the wood of which matches the trees outside his house. While they continue to investigate the crime, Mulder and Scully are approached by a mysterious man who claims that a \\"bad man\\" is killing the area's trees. While this is happening, Matthews takes Lisa to her house, claiming that she is protecting her. After Lisa overhears Matthews arguing with a man, she journeys into Matthews' root cellar, where she finds a corpse. When she tries to leave, she finds she has been locked in. Mulder later discovers that Matthews' father was retrieved from a mud puddle twenty years before the events of the episode. He begins to suspect her of wrongdoing suspicion that is furthered after he digs up her father's empty coffin. Later, the mysterious man from before tells Mulder that Matthews' father's death ended a blight that had been killing trees in the town. Lisa's aunt journeys to Matthews' house to retrieve her niece, but is killed by Matthews, who is revealed to have a split personality engendered by abuse from her own father. This has also given her power to control the trees in the area. Mulder and Scully later search Matthews' house and find the mysterious corpse in the basement who they realize is the body of Matthews's father as well as an unharmed Lisa. Meanwhile, Matthews goes to Bobby's house and chases him into the orchard from earlier. The agents show up soon thereafter, and both Mulder and Bobby are nearly drowned in mud. Suddenly, the mysterious man from earlier cuts Matthews' head off with an axe, ending her power over the trees.Meisler, pp. 112–24. ==Production== Conception and writing \\"Schizogeny\\" was written by Jessica Scott and Mike Wollaegertheir first for the series.Gradnitzer, p. 166. Due to it being Scot and Wollaeger's first episode, \\"Schizogeny\\" took a long time to write and, according to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, \\"went through many, many incarnations and versions.\\" Due to the episode's plot and setting, it became sardonically known as \\"The Killer Tree Episode\\" among the cast and crew. The episode's title is a biological term for the creation of cavities by separating out existing cells. Casting Chad Lindberg was cast as Bobby Rich. Katharine Isabelle, who portrayed Lisa Baiocchi, was the daughter of Graeme Murray, the production designer for The X-Files. Kate Robbins, who played Lisa's aunt Linda, had previously appeared in the third season episode \\"D.P.O.\\" Chad Lindberg was cast as Bobby Rich, and when the episode was being edited, there was worry that his delivery was not pronounced enough, so many of his lines were later dubbed in a studio. David Duchovny, too, was required to overdub a line: during the scene in which Mulder tells Scully Bobby's nickname, Duchovny originally said \\"Dickweed\\". Fox's standards and practices department objected to the term and made the show change the name to \\"Dorkweed\\". Set and score While much of \\"Schizogeny\\" was filmed on a real orchard named Hazelgrove Farms near Fort Langley, British Columbia, the sinking mud scenes were shot on a soundstage at Lion's Gate Studios that was fitted with over 200 hazelnut trees. The mud pit was made out of a large tank filled with soil, Sphagnum moss, and water. The mixture was heated so that the actors would not be cold while filming. The shot that called for Karin Matthews' lifeless body to sink into the mud required a stunt woman to be slowly lowered into the pit, which necessitated the crew supplying her with oxygen, given how deep the tank was. Toby Lindala and his art department created all of the props used in the episode, including the moving tree roots and the corpse of Karin Matthews' father.Meisler, p. 125. Several of the shooting locations were chosen because of their proximity to large trees. Lisa's house, for instance, was next to a large willow, which was fitted with a fake tree limb twenty feet long to give it a more menacing feel. The tree limb that attacks Mulder's car was a branch from a tree that had broken off and fallen on government land. The producers secured permission from the Canadian government to retrieve the branch, and then hoisted it into the air before dropping it onto a retired police car. After the stunt, Nigel Habgood, the series' car coordinator, refurbished the car and it was later re-used in the episode \\"Kill Switch.\\" Mark Snow, composer for the series, was particularly proud of the music he wrote for the episode, which he felt \\"complement[ed]\\" the \\"dark ... wonderful aura\\" of the episode. He credits the ominous feel of his final soundtrack to his use of synthesized woodwind instruments. ==Broadcast and reception== \\"Schizogeny\\" premiered on the Fox network on January 11, 1998. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 12.9, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 12.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 21.37 million viewers.Meisler, p. 284. The episode received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with several reviewers dubbing it one of the worst episodes of the series. Francis Dass of the New Straits Times Press referred to it as \\"one of the weaker episodes\\" of the fifth season. The A.V. Club reviewer Emily VanDerWerff gave \\"Schizogeny\\" a D–, and wrote that \\"'Schizogeny' just might be the very worst episode of The X-Files\\", noting that \\"the tone [of the episode] is off.\\" Furthermore, VanDerWerff felt that \\"the more Scott and Wollaeger try to continue explaining this and tie it into the idea of child abuse, the less it attains any of the power or tragedy they want it to have.\\" Starpulse, in a run-down of the best and worst episodes and villains of the series, named the killer trees the worst monster-of-the-week and wrote, \\"[Schizogeny] proved that even the X-Files writers can come up completely dry on their scary creeps sometimes.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three- and-a-half stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the first part of the episode noting that \\"director Ralph Hemecker [brings] the eeriness to the fore, and [makes] this a more honest-to-truth scary slice of X-File than has been offered in ages.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 132. Shearman and Pearson, however, argued that the episode's references to Psycho and its \\"lack of explanation\\" result in the episode approaching \\"nonsense.\\" Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She wrote, \\"The plot of 'Schizogeny' is more tangled than the episode's paranormal root system, but underneath lies some powerful themes.\\" == Footnotes Bibliography== * * == External links == * \\"Schizogeny\\" on TheXFiles.com * * Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Michigan Category:The X-Files (season 5) episodes ","title":"Schizogeny"},{"id":"12353114","text":"Clinopodium mutabile is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae.

Its flexous rod-shaped particles measure about 539 nm in length. Like other members of the Potexvirus genus, ClYMV is a monopartite strand of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA surrounded by a capsid made for a single viral encoded protein. The genome has been completely sequenced and is 7015 nucleotides long. No insect vector is known. This virus is transmitted by mechanical inoculation, sometime by seeds and by dodder (Cuscuta campestris). Potexviruses make banned inclusions made up of layers of parallel virus particles. These inclusions can be seen in the light microscope in leaf strips of infected plant tissue stained with Azure A or Orange-Green stains.Christie, R.G. and Edwardson, J.R. (1977). Fla Agric. Exp. Stn Monog. No. 9, 150 pp. For many potexviruses these inclusions can be disrupted during the staining procedures. The banded inclusions of ClYMV (Fig.1) however, remain stable and therefore can be diagnostic. Antiserum is available for this virus and, as mentioned above, so is sequence data. Figure 1. Banned inclusions body (I) of Clover yellow mosaic virus in Vicia faba cells, stained with Azure A.(N = nucleus) ==Host range and geographic distribution== The major host of ClYMV is clover (Trifolium spp). It was first reported in white clover (Trifolium repens ) as early as 1939. However, in 1942 the virus in white clover, then called Trifolium virus 1 or white-clover mosaic was found to be two different viruses Johnson, Phytopathology 32: 103, 1942. when one proved to be transmitted by dodder and did not infect cowpea (Vigna sinensis). The one that systemically infected cowpea became known first as pea wilt virus and then as White clover mosaic virus (WClMV). The one that was transmitted by dodder became known as pea mottle virus and eventually Clover yellow mosaic virus.Pratt, M.J. Can. J. Bot. 39: 655, 1961 ClYMV is now known to infect several other species of clover,Symptoms of ClYMV in clover peas (Pisum sativum), faba beans (Vicia faba), green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) and snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus). ClYMV can infect cowpea but it does not spread as fast as WClMV or at all beyond the inoculated leaves.(7) Until the year 2004, ClYMV was found only in north western regions of the United States and south western regions of Canada. In 2004 it was reported in the eastern United States (Florida) for what is believed to be the first time. It was found in a new host, the ornamental plant, Verbena canadensis variety ‘homestead purple’.Baker et al. 2004 Plant Dis. 88:223 In 2005, it was reported in England in another verbena variety.Mumford et al. 2005 Plant Pathology 54:568 Verbena varieties are propagated by cuttings. ==ReferencesExternal links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Clover yellow mosaic virus * Descriptions of Plant Viruses *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Potexviruses Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Clover yellow mosaic virus"},{"id":"12353288","text":"Coleus cataractarum, synonym Plectranthus cataractarum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae.

In Asia and Africa the major disease of cotton is caused by the Cotton leaf curl geminivirus (CLCuV). Leaves of infected cotton curl upward and bear leaf-like enations on the underside along with vein thickening. Plants infected early in the season are stunted and yield is reduced drastically. (A. Nadeem and Z. Xiong, University of Arizona) This virus devastated the Pakistan cotton industry in early 1990s where it caused an estimated yield reduction of 30-35%. ==Description== All Begomovirus species causing cotton leaf curl disease have geminate particles, approximately 18-20 nm in diameter and 30 nm long and a circular, single- stranded DNA genome. All except Cotton leaf crumple virus have a monopartite genome, with all viral products required for replication, systemic movement and whitefly transmission encoded on a single DNA component of c. 2.75 kB (DNA A). The genome of CLCrV is bipartite. Two smaller, circular, single-stranded DNA molecules, named DNA 1 and DNA β, are associated with a range of monopartite begomoviruses from the Old World including the cotton leaf curl viruses. These molecules are regarded as satellite molecules as they depend on the helper begomovirus to support one or more stages of their infection cycle (movement and insect transmission for both molecules and, additionally, replication in the case of DNA β). DNA β is symptom-modulating and typical cotton leaf curl disease symptoms only develop when this molecule is present: in the absence of DNA β, the concentration of viral DNA (DNA A) is low and the symptoms of infection very mild. DNA β has a single open reading frame (βC1 ORF), which encodes a suppressor of RNA silencing. DNA 1 is homologous to the DNA-R component of the nanoviruses and encodes a master replication initiator (M-Rep) protein but its presence does not alter symptom expression. (Corresponding author: Dr Andrew Geering 2007) The plant resistance to against CLCuV was described by Ali (1997, 1999) that the CLCuV resistance was controlled by single dominate gene, and could be transferred to any cultivar by using back cross technique. ==Prevention and control== #Use resistant or tolerant cultivars #Protect seedlings from whiteflies #Use only good seeds and healthy transplants #Control whiteflies #Immediately remove infected-looking plants and bury them #Control weeds #Do not plant cotton near tomato and/or other crops susceptible to whiteflies or vice #Use acephate-imidacloprid at 50% - 1.8% respectively, at every seven days. #Plow-under all plant debris after harvest or burn them when possible #Practice crop rotation by planting crops that are not susceptible to whitefly ==References== *Xiong, Z.; Nadeem, A.; Weng, Z.; Nelson, M.

It does guarantee certain human rights to all citizens, with the condition that all legislation must be compatible with principles of Islamic Shariah law.  Penal Code  Punishment for homosexuality in Yemen can originate from the codified penal code, or from people seeking to enforce traditional Islamic morality. Article 264 of the national penal code prohibits private consensual homosexual acts between adult men. The stipulated punishment in the law for unmarried men is 100 lashes and up to a year in prison. The law stipulates that married men convicted of homosexuality are to be put to death. Article 268 of the national penal code prohibits private consensual homosexual acts between adult women. The law stipulates that premeditated acts of lesbianism are punished with up to three years in prison. In addition to the penal code, punishment for homosexuality can originate from people seeking to enforce traditional Islamic morality within their own family or for the broader society.

He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (17th overall pick) of the 1985 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Michigan. ==Early years== Brooks was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1963. He attended Mackenzie High School in Detroit, where he was an All- American and an All-state defensive lineman. He was a member of the National Honor Society and received his school's scholar-athlete award, while graduating in 1981. ==College career== Brooks enrolled at the University of Michigan in the fall of 1981 and played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1981 to 1984. He played at outside linebacker as a freshman before moving to the defensive tackle position in 1982. As a sophomore, he started the first 4 games at defensive tackle for the 1982 Michigan Wolverines football team, before a knee injury against the University of Indiana sidelined him for 4 constests. He returned to start against UCLA in the 1983 Rose Bowl, making 10 tackles (second on the team). As a junior, he started all 12 games at defensive tackle for the 1983 Michigan team that compiled a 9-3 record and was ranked #8 in the final AP Poll. He posted 48 tackles (seventh on the team), 6 tackles for loss and 3 sacks. At the end of the season, he was selected by the conference coaches as a first-team defensive lineman on the 1983 All-Big Ten Conference football team. As a senior, he started 11 games at defensive tackle for the 1984 Michigan team. At 6'6\\", 273 lbs, Brooks led the team with six sacks and 13 tackles for loss, while also making 69 tackles (fourth on the team). He was selected for the second consecutive year as an All-Big Ten player. During his college career at Michigan, Brooks recorded 156 tackles, two pass breakups and two fumble recoveries.(to retrieve career statistics, enter \\"brooks\\" in the box for the player's last name and \\"kevin\\" in the box for first name) ==Professional football== Dallas Cowboys In the 1985 NFL Draft the Dallas Cowboys were targeting Jerry Rice with their first round selection, but settled for Brooks (17th overall) after Rice was taken by the San Francisco 49ers. He had a disappointing rookie season, playing all four defensive line positions, registering 12 tackles and 2 sacks. His best game came against the Houston Oilers, when he replaced an injured Jim Jeffcoat in the second half, making 4 tackles and one sack. In 1986, he competed with John Dutton for the left defensive tackle position, but suffered a dislocated knee cap in the preseason game against the San Diego Chargers. He lost 7 games on the injured reserve list, limiting him to 9 regular season games as a backup and 9 tackles to go along with 2.5 sacks. In 1987, he became the starter at left defensive tackle after passing Dutton on the depth chart. When the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16-game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. On October 7, he crossed the picket line and joined the replacement team. He led the team's defensive linemen with 67 tackles, while adding 3 sacks during the season. In 1988, he started 14 out of 15 games, registering 71 tackles and 5 sacks. In the spring of 1989, Brooks clashed with new head coach Jimmy Johnson, before being traded along with a fourth round draft choice (#82-Jeroy Robinson) to the Denver Broncos, in exchange for a third round draft choice (#80-Greg McMurtry). Denver Broncos In 1989, the Denver Broncos moved Brooks to defensive end and lasted just a few months before being released on September 4. Detroit Lions On September 11, 1989, he signed with the Detroit Lions and was named the starting right defensive end after Keith Ferguson was injured. He started 15 games, registering 39 tackles and 2 sacks. The next year, he appeared in only six games (4 starts) at defensive tackle and was waived by the Lions on November 2, 1990. Brooks retired after playing in the NFL for six seasons from 1985 to 1990. He appeared in 69 games, 45 of them as a starter. He is credited with 15.5 quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. ==Personal life== After retiring from football, Brooks suffered from depression, and his weight increased to nearly 400 pounds. He underwent a gastric sleeve weight-loss procedure, lost 110 pounds, and became a celebrity spokesperson for The Alexander Center for Obesity Surgery in Dallas. He is married to Tiffany Brooks. His children are Kevin Ashton Craig Brooks, Jordan Phillip Brooks, Sanaa Marie Brooks, and Gage Joaquin Brooks. His father is former NFL player Theodore Wheeler. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Players of American football from Michigan ","title":"Kevin Brooks (American football)"},{"id":"12353378","text":"Salvia unguella is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae that is native to Ecuador.

DEK is the official shorthand system in Germany and Austria today. It is used for word-for-word recordings of debates in the Federal Parliament of Germany. == Development == The original version of DEK was created by an expert committee in 1924, based on the ideas of earlier systems like those of Gabelsberger, Faulmann and Stolze-Schrey. Revised versions were introduced in 1936 and 1968. The latest reform of the Einheitskurzschrift was concluded in Vienna in 1962 after many years of work and officially introduced into the German educational system in Mainz in 1968 by the German Kultusministerkonferenz (State Conference on Education) as the Wiener Urkunde (“Vienna Document”) titled Systemurkunde der Deutschen Einheitskurzschrift – Wiener Urkunde – vom 1. August 1968. This may be considered largely the brainchild of Georg Paucker, who (as representative of the German Confederation of Trade Unions) applied himself particularly to the reform negotiations regarding the Verkehrsschrift. == Principles ==  Writing system  DEK is based on indirect indication of vowels. There are several graphemes for common consonant-sequences and for single consonants, too. Vowels are indicated through the positional relation of two following consonant-graphemes in the line-system. For instance ‘sch’ is represented by one grapheme. To write the word ‘sch-e-sch’, which is not an actual German word, one and another sch-grapheme is connected by a short line at the same height above the line. The ‘e’ is indicated by the short connection between them. Furthermore, not only the relation is relevant, but the line pressure, too. That is why DEK is designed for pencils. An ‘a’ would be indicated by a short connection and a heavier down-line of the following consonant-grapheme. Up-lines are not written with a heavy line for speed reasons. All in all, shorthand reduces words to syllables, where whole syllables are written at once. Beside the basic system there is a huge set of static unpaired abbreviations. For example, the German form of to be, 3rd person singular indicative present tense “ist” is a single dot on the upper line. These additional symbols must be learned by repetition.  Rules  Since the 1968 reform, DEK is written at three levels: Verkehrsschrift, Eilschrift and Redeschrift – correspondence style, quick style and reporters' style – each building up on the lower level. A text in Verkehrsschrift can be produced at a rate of 80 to 120 syllables per minute. Eilschrift and particularly Redeschrift employ contractions and other simplifications to a far greater extent, making rates of up to 475 syllables per minute possible. This enables real-time recordings of speeches. The current speed record using DEK is 520 syllables per minute and was achieved by Josef Hrycyk in 1974.  Foreign language adaptions  Shorthand writers do not usually learn shorthand systems of other languages, if they have to write in foreign languages only occasionally. Someone might get confused by totally different systems. Instead, there are several adaptations of DEK for other languages, such as English, French, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, and even Latin. The English adaptation created by Lege and Bäse (see links), which is the most popular English adaptation of DEK, allows speeds up to 300 syllables per minute and more.  Criticism  DEK faced a lot of criticism, especially during the prime of shorthand; for example, the heavier versions of consonant-graphemes and the complex ruleset were said to slow down learning speed. As a result, there have been efforts to create simpler shorthand systems that can be learned more quickly but may not achieve comparable speeds. One of these alternative systems is Stiefografie. == Publications == * == References  External links == * * Deutscher Stenografenbund e. V.

He is founder and chief executive officer of Vespoli USA, Inc., a boat manufacturer in New Haven, Connecticut, that makes shells for rowing teams and individual rowers. Vespoli was born in New Haven, Connecticut. ==Career== His career in rowing started in 1964 when he joined the Georgetown University crew as a walk-on. He went on to row with teams that won several national championships, placed in the 1972 Munich Olympics and, in 1974, was part of a team of eight American rowers that won a World Championship in Switzerland. He later coached universities and was a sculling coach for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted. As boat technology developed rapidly in England with the advent of carbon fiber and other materials used by the aerospace industry, Vespoli started his company with the help of his retired machinist father in 1980 in the U.S. His wife Nancy Vespoli, who was on the women's crew at Dartmouth College, a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic rowing crew and has a master's degree in chemical engineering from M.I.T., is also involved in the business. The company has become a well-known boat maker with models that have won many elite races.

Johnson was the assistant coach and Vespoli an oarsman on the 1972 U.S. Olympic Crew. Johnson recommended Vespoli for the Wichita State University position, and Johnson hired Vespoli as Yale's Frosh Men's Coach in 1977. Vespoli is Committee Co-Chair of the Georgetown University Boathouse project where Johnson has coached since 1989. Vespoli is a former member of the U.S. Olympic Committee for Men's Rowing, a consultant to the President's Commission on Olympic Sports and was an NBC commentator for rowing in Barcelona in 1992. A member of both the National Rowing Foundation Hall of Fame and the Georgetown Athletic Hall of Fame, Mike has maintained a strong connection to the Georgetown crew program that launched his professionally and personally rewarding career. He served as the chair of the rowing association's board of directors for 16 years and has been a member of the board of regents for another 16. In 2000, Georgetown honored Mike with the Outstanding Service to Athletics award. Mike and his wife, Nancy, are members of the Georgetown 1789 Society. Mike and Nancy Vespoli established the Vespoli Family Crew Scholarship at Georgetown University in 2003. The scholarship provides financial aid to one or more intercollegiate rowers who demonstrate financial need. The Vespolis have also donated money in support of the Georgetown University Boathouse project. In April 2006, Nancy Vespoli donated a shell to the Dartmouth College Women's Crew. The crew christened the new shell, the \\"Fast Eddie.\\" The shell was named after Nancy's father, Eddie Parssinen. In 2000, Vespoli was honored with the \\"Power Ten\\" award. The award is given to those who are committed to supporting the sport of rowing, both nationally and internationally. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Interview on May 28, 2009 * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:American male rowers Category:Georgetown Hoyas rowers Category:UMass Minutemen and Minutewomen rowing coaches Category:Wichita State Shockers rowing coaches Category:Yale Bulldogs rowing coaches Category:World Rowing Championships medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in rowing Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Congressional Gold Medal recipients Category:Olympic rowers of the United States Category:Rowers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 1975 Pan American Games ","title":"Mike Vespoli"},{"id":"12353415","text":"Aman Doktor (Oh!

This palm is typically fairly small and slender, normally attaining 15–25 feet in height but has attained 36 feet grown in greenhouse conditions. Most plants maintain 5-7 fronds when young, gradually building up the crown as the palm ages, and sometimes reaches 10-12 fronds when mature. ==Uses, Cultivation, and Care== The Adonidia palm, sometimes described as the \\"mini-royal-palm\\", adapts well to landscaping and cultivation, as well as growing in pots. It is able to withstand large amounts of rainfall and can tolerate short droughts, though it does not like sea salt. Adonidias prefer full sun but can withstand partial shade. They are not tolerant of the cold (hardy to 35F when young; 30F when mature), making their perennial outdoor usage limited to frost-free zones. One of the most common landscape palms in Florida (used at such places as Mar-A-Lago and the Miami Open tennis tournament), it is often clustered together in groups of 2-3, sometimes four. Because, in its natural state, it grows as a solitary palm, this batching together of several heads runs the risk of the head competing against themselves. In order to minimize the risk, nurseries train these palms when young to arch outward, instead of growing straight up. Adonidia merrillii is widely planted in cultivation and grows well in tropical locations such as Hawaii and the southern half of the Florida peninsula. It is also one of the most commonly planted ornamental palms in the world, often planted in non- tropical locations such as shopping malls. It is sometimes used as an annual in places that freeze in the Winter (for example, Times Square, New York City plants these for the warm-weather season). The Adonidia is also commonly placed indoors in hotels, casinos, and other higher-end establishments due to its ability to adjust to lower light conditions. They are self-pruning palms and require little to no maintenance.https://gardeningsolutions.ifas.ufl.edu/plants/trees-and- shrubs/palms-and-cycads/christmas-palm.html Its fruits are sometimes said to be used as a substitute for the betel nut, in preparing buyo (fruit of Areca catechu, leaves of Piper betle, and lime) for chewing.William H.

In 1945 she was transferred to the Soviet Union and served in the Soviet Navy after that as T-279. ==Construction and commissioning== Palisade was laid down at Chickasaw, Alabama by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation on 21 September 1942. She was launched on 26 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. W. C. Ellis, and 'commissioned on 9 March 1944 with Lieutenant Commander W. H. Rothwell in command. ==Service history== U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945 Following shakedown, Palisade conducted minesweeping operations at Naval Station Argentia in the Dominion of Newfoundland as part of Mine Squadron 33, then was fitted out as a temporary weather ship. She patrolled in the North Atlantic on weather reporting duties for the remainder of 1944 with occasional calls at United States East Coast ports. In January 1945 she was refitted with minesweeping equipment and, after overhaul in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, deployed to the Panama Canal Zone on 27 February 1945. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Palisade transiting the Panama Canal on 8 March 1945 and proceeded to Seattle, Washington, where she prepared for transfer. With preparations complete, she departed Seattle on 7 April 1945 bound for Kodiak, Alaska, then proceeded from Kodiak to Cold Bay, where she begin familiarization training of her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. Soviet Navy, 1945-1960 Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Palisade was decommissioned on 22 May 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-279 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she soon entered service with the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others - such as T-279 (ex- Palisade) - because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. ==Disposal== The Soviet Union reported that T-279 has been sunk off Kham Island, Korea, on 14 or 15 August 1945, by a naval mine previously laid by American aircraft to target Japanese ships.

The fruit are red, long. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described by German botanist Max Burret in 1937 based on a collection made in November 1936 by Colombian botanist J.M. Duque. The generic epithet, Aiphanes, coined by German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1801, derives from Greek ai, meaning \\"always\\" and phaneros, meaning \\"evident\\", \\"visible\\" or \\"conspicuous\\". The specific epithet, duquei, honours the collector, J.M. Duque. Burret placed Aiphanes duquei in the subgenus Brachyanthera, one of the two subgenera into which he divided the genus. While Borchsenius and Bernal recognised the other subgenus, Macroanthera as a potentially cohesive unit, they concluded that the remaining subgenus Brachyanthera would be overly heterogeneous, and consequently abandoned Burret's use of subgenera. ==Distribution and status== Aiphanes duquei is endemic to an area of in the Cordillera Occidental in Colombia. It is found in cloudy, lower montane wet and rain forests, primarily in the Munchique and Farallones de Cali National Parks. On the basis of its limited distribution, and the fact that its habitat is vulnerable to expanding agriculture and forest management practices, it is classified as a vulnerable species. ==References== duquei Category:Endemic flora of Colombia Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Aiphanes duquei"},{"id":"12353485","text":"Aiphanes grandis is a species of flowering plant in the family family Arecaceae.

Phytopath. 11: 439 These include other vegetables such as squash, melons, peppers, beans,Vegetable MD Online: Bean – Cucumber mosaic Cucumovirus tomatoes, carrots, celery, lettuce, spinachVegetable MD Online: Virus Diseases of Leafy Vegetables and Celery and beets, various weeds and many ornamentals and bedding plants, such as Narcissus. Symptoms seen with this virus include leaf mosaic or mottling (Fig. 2a), yellowing (Fig. 3a), ringspots (Fig. 4a), stunting, and leaf,Vegetable MD Online: Important New York Vegetable Diseases flower and fruit distortion. CMV shows symptoms on leaves known as the \\"shoestring\\" effect for most host species. This effect causes young leaves to appear narrow and the entire plant to be stunted. Specifically CMV can cause cucumbers to turn pale and bumpy. The leaves of these plants turn mosaic and their rugosity is often changed, making leaves wrinkled and misshapen. Growth of these plants is usually stunted and produces few flowers. Often cucumber fruits are oddly shaped and appear gray. This appearance often leads to cucumbers being referred to as \\"white pickles\\". Often infected cucumbers are bitter. In celery, CMV can cause streaking and spotting and can be often confused with symptoms of the celery mosaic virus. Symptoms of CMV in lettuce can be similar to those of lettuce mosaic virus. Infected plants show symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and often do not properly head. Some of the most important fruits and vegetables affected by CMV are peppers, bananas, tomatoes and cucurbits. CMV in peppers causes slightly different symptoms than the previously mentioned. Pepper plants often have severe foliar damage, shown as mosaic and necrotic rings. Often the peppers themselves are misshapen and contain chlorotic rings and spots. Tomato plants are usually stunted and have poorly shaped leaves, or \\"fernleaf\\", when infected by CMV. Also certain strains of CMV can cause partial or total crop loss. The cucumber mosaic virus has been found on American beautyberry, an important wildlife and pollinator food source plant native to North America. Image:CMVCd.jpg Fig.4a. Symptoms in Commelina diffusa Image:Cucumber mosiac virus inclusion bodies.jpgCucumber mosaic virus inclusion bodies == Importance == As CMV is easily spread, it can be found worldwide. It is transmitted by more than 60 different aphid species, among other vectors, and it can infect over 1200 plant species, including important crops and ornamental species. In its plant host, CMV can cause severe damage, which can lead to economical losses, as it can lead to 10-20% loss of field yield. == Disease cycle == CMV is mainly transmitted by aphids, but it can also be mechanically spread by humans in some cases. However, the mechanically spreading of this virus is not as common as the case of other virus (such as Tobacco Mosaic Virus, TMV), because CMV is not a very stable virus. When it is transmitted by aphids, this virus has an acquisition period of five to ten seconds and an inoculation period of about a minute. Nevertheless, after two minutes, the probability of inoculation largely decreases, and within two hours it is practically impossible to transmit it. Moreover, CMV can overwinter in perennial plants and weeds, as it can survive the winter in the roots of the plant and move to the aerial parts in spring, where it can be transmitted by aphids to other plants. Once the virus penetrates into the host cell, it releases its RNAs into the host cytoplasm. Then, proteins 1a and 2a are produced to enable the virus replication, which takes place in viral factories, which are subcellular compartments which increase the efficiency of this process. There, a dsRNA genome is synthetized from the ssRNA(+) and transcribed in order to obtain viral mRNAs as well as new ssRNAs. Afterwards, the capsid proteins are produced and the new viral particles are assembled. Finally, the virus is ready to move to a new cell by triggering the formation of tubular structures which mediate the movement of the virions . The short-distance (cell-to-cell) movement of the virus is achieved via plasmodesmata, while the long-distance one (within the plant) occurs via the phloem. == Properties==  Genome  CMVICTVd Descriptions:Cucumber mosaic virus is a linear positive-sense, tripartite single-stranded RNA virus . Its genome size is 8.623 kb and it is divided among RNA1 (3357 pb) , RNA2 (3050 pb) and RNA3 (2216 pb) , all of which has a tRNA-like structure . These three RNAs encode five proteins, proteins 1a, 2a, 2b, movement protein (MP) and coat protein (CP). While proteins 1a and 2a are responsible for the replication of the virus, protein 2b is the host-silencing suppressor. The RNA is surrounded by a protein coat consisting of 32 copies of a single structural protein which form isometric particles.ICTVdB - Picture Gallery:Images of CMV  Virion  This virus presents non-enveloped, icosahedral or bacilliform virions of 26-35 nm in diameter. The different RNAs are encapsidated in distinct particles, which results in a variety of virions .  Environment  CMV is naturally found in temperate areas, where aphids, one of its main vectors, are also found.  Diagnosis  The presence of this virus in a plant can be confirmed by serological (ELISA), genetic (PCR) or host range tests.  Management  Currently there is no chemical capable of removing this virus from an infected plant, and therefore the best control is prevention of the infection and eradication.Pest Alert: Cucumber mosaic virus To achieve this, it is crucial to remove weeds and diseased plants from the field, as well as use clean and sanitized tools. Another option consists of the use of resistant varieties or the so-called \\"trap crops\\". ==References Bibliography == * Other on-line Links about CMV for growers and gardeners #Texas Plant Disease Handbook: Cucumber Mosaic #Weekend Gardener: Cucumber mosaic virus #Ohio Floriculture: Cucumber mosaic virus ==External links== * ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Cucumber mosaic virus * Family Groups - The Baltimore Method * Plant Viruses Online – VIDE Database * Descriptions of Plant Viruses * Weekendgardner Monthly Web Magazine: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * Crop Knowledge Master: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * AVRDC - The World Vegetable Center Fact Sheet: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * University of Illinois Extension - Report on Plant Disease: Mosaic Diseases of Cucurbits * APSnet: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * Alabama Cooperative Extension System - Alabama A&M; and Auburn Universities Plant Disease Notes: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * Florida Tomato Scouting Guide: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * HYPP Pathology: Cucumber Mosaic Virus * ICTVdB Virus Descriptions: Cucumber Mosaic Virus Category:Bromoviridae Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Cucumber mosaic virus"},{"id":"12353681","text":"Attalea tessmannii is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

Cymbidium mosaic virus and the Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) are two of the most common viruses affecting cultivated orchids worldwide. Infected plants can have less desirable flowers or other problems, causing significant financial losses to orchid growers. The virus has not often been reported in wild orchid populations. It can be found in a wide variety of orchid genera but does not infect plants other than orchids. Once an orchid is infected, the virus spreads throughout the infected plant in a number of weeks. Control measures may include sanitizing pruning equipment between plants. There is an ELISA test available to test for presence of the virus. It is related to the Narcissus mosaic virus (NMV), the Scallion virus X (SVX), the Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and the Potato aucuba mosaic virus (PAMV). ==Importance== Orchids are composed of nearly 200,000 species of plants with attractive flowers. They are predominantly found in wet climates. The orchid family is one of the most important plant families in respect to the ornamental flower industry. In 2005, the potted orchid industry brought in about $144 million in the United States. This makes them the second most valuable potted plant in the nation. From 1996 to 2006 there has been a 206.4% increase in potted orchid prices. Globally, Taiwan, Taipei, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest importers of potted orchids. Additionally, orchids are the source of vanilla. It is the only commercially important derivation from the plants - most commonly found in the Vanilla planifolia species. Certain orchids are also used in homeopathic treatments. The virus stunts the growth of orchids both through size reduction as well as lowering flower yield. CymMV has also been linked to cases of breakage in flower coloration as well as blossom necrosis. This is especially important because this causes the commercial value of the plants to be greatly reduced. ==Signs and symptoms== CymMV causes a mosaic of irregularly shaped chlorotic and/or necrotic lesions to appear on infected hosts. Additionally, infected plants will show smaller yields. Sometimes the orchids may display chlorotic rings while others will display symptoms in lesions. Sunken patches can also be observed on leaves. Lastly, certain infected plants may be symptom-less but are still viral enough to infect other neighboring plants. This is because the chlorosis and necrosis can take time to show; however, the virus can still be present on a leaf that does not display such obvious symptoms of the disease. The virus is still able to be transmitted from the plant despite its \\"healthy\\" appearance. The virus can be detected with ELISA, immunodiffusion tests, or a nucleic acid hybridization assay. ==Viral cycle== alt=A The Cymbidium mosaic virus starts out by infecting the host through a wound on the plant. Generally this wound occurs through plant propagation using contaminated cutting tools. Once inside the orchid, the virion uncoats, binds its coat protein to the host on the 5’ SL 1 RNA stem loop and begins incorporating its RNA into it. This allows for the host cell to begin producing virus particles. The virus then begins infecting reading frames such as TGB1, TGB 2, and TGB 3, each of which aid in the virus’s ability to spread from cell-to-cell in the orchid. When the virus infects TGB 1, it allows for the virus to move easily through the plasmodesmata. After the virus infects TGB 2 and TGB 3, it allows for the virus to begin moving through each of the orchid cells' endoplasmic reticulum. Affecting these sites allows for the virus to move easily through each of the plant cells. Overall, the monopartite, positive, sRNA from the virion connects its 3’ tail with that of the host’s 5’ RNA. Translations will continue to occur, and disassemble from the 5’ end of the virion. With more of the virions circulating throughout the host, it only takes another wound from a cutting tool to begin infecting another orchid. ==Environment== When cultivated in a greenhouse or commercially, the virus is spread mechanically if tools used in cultivation are not properly sanitized. The virus exists systemically within the plant, and persists in sap that can be spread by such methods. In the wild, the virus is most likely spread by insect vectors. A different orchid virus, the orchid fleck virus, may be transmitted by the Brevipalpus mite. There is also evidence that cockroaches are able to transmit CymMV. ==Management== There is no way to cure a plant that has the virus. The only thing to do once a plant is infected is to destroy it. The best management solution is to prevent the spread of disease. This is accomplished through effective disinfection of tools used in cultivation, including any plastic containers and razor blades. Autoclaving, flaming, and chemical treatment with trisodium phosphate and bleach solution are traditional methods for disinfection. The use of Streptomyces culture filtrate, which has also been shown to disinfect mad cow disease-causing prions, is another promising disinfectant. This method is shown to be effective in removing the virus from various tools, human nails, and orchid seeds. Another possible management strategy is development of plant resistance. An attempt to transform a mutant CymMV movement protein gene into Dendrobium orchids was slightly successful (9 of 259 plants were resistant and expressed the marker gene); the success of transformations actually conferring resistance appears to be related to a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism. ==ReferencesExternal links== * ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Cymbidium mosaic virus * Family Groups - The Baltimore Method Category:Potexviruses Category:Orchid diseases Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases ","title":"Cymbidium mosaic virus"},{"id":"12353729","text":"Balaka longirostris is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

Kinetic architecture is a concept through which buildings are designed to allow parts of the structure to move, without reducing overall structural integrity. A building's capability for motion can be used just to: enhance its aesthetic qualities; respond to environmental conditions; and/or, perform functions that would be impossible for a static structure. The possibilities for practical implementations of kinetic architecture increased sharply in the late 20th century due to advances in mechanics, electronics, and robotics. ==History== An early instance of kinetic architecture – the drawbridge Rudimentary forms of kinetic architecture such as the drawbridge can be traced back to the Middle Ages or earlier. Yet it was only in the early 20th century that architects began to widely discuss the possibility for movement to be enabled for a significant portion of a buildings' superstructure. In the first third of the 20th century, interest in kinetic architect was one of the stands of thought emerging from the Futurism movement. Various papers and books included plans and drawings for moving buildings, a notable example being Chernikhov's 101 Architectural Fantasies (1933). For the first few decades of the 20th century kinetic architecture was almost entirely theoretical, but by the 1940s innovators such as Buckminster Fuller began experimenting with concrete implementations, though his early efforts in this direction are not regarded as totally successful. In 1970, engineer/architect William Zuk published the book Kinetic architecture, which helped inspire a new generation of architects to design an increasingly wide range of actual working kinetic buildings. Assisted by new concepts such as Fuller's Tensegrity and by developments in robotics, kinetic buildings have become increasingly common worldwide since the 1980s. ==Themes== The Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, Germany is an example of a stadium with a retractable roof and a retractable pitch By the early 21st century three interrelated themes had emerged. The first is for functional buildings such as bridges which can elevate their midsections to allow tall ships to pass, or stadiums with retractable roofs such as the Veltins-Arena, Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, or Wembley Stadium. A second theme is for fantastic structures that can perform Transformer style changes of shape or which have a visually stunning appearance. The bird-like Burke Brise soleil at the Milwaukee Art Museum is a well regarded example of this, though it also has a functional aspect in that its movement allows it to shade the crowds from the sun or protect them from storms. The third theme is for movement to occur on the surface of the building, creating what Buckminster Fuller called a \\"skin-like articulation\\" effect. A classic example of this is the Institut du Monde Arabe. ==Other uses of the term== Architects Sarah Bonnemaison and Christine Macy have suggested that movement can be an inspiring idea for architecture without the designs having to allow for actual movement – they can merely suggest it as was the case for some of the constructions of Gaudi or their own recent work.Symposium on Architecture and Movement Dalhousie University (2006) The term Kinetic architecture can also refer to static buildings designed to accentuate human movement, such as the performing arts.Kinetic architecture by Alica Wolfard (2006) The phrase has been chosen as a title for performing groups including a dance company.Kinetic architecture dance trope ==See also== *Responsive architecture ==Notes and referencesExternal links== *Robotecture: Interactive Architecture – information and discussion about kinetic architecture and interactive architecture *Kinetic Architecture – blog with many examples of kinetic architecture *Hoberman Transformable Design – Chuck Hoberman's design group *Adaptive Building Initiative – Company dedicated to designing and building adaptive buildings and structures *\\"What are 'Kinetic Buildings'?\\" – 3 minute video Category:Architectural design Category:Building engineering ","title":"Kinetic architecture"},{"id":"12353775","text":"Basselinia porphyrea is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

He played college football at the University of Detroit Mercy where he was selected as a first-team All-American in 1940. He also played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Cardinals from 1942 to 1950, and for the Detroit Lions from 1951 to 1953. He was a first-team All-NFL player three times and played on three NFL championship teams. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1975 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986. ==Early years== Banonis was born on April 9, 1921, in Detroit, Michigan, to a family of Lithuanian origin. He attended Detroit Catholic Central High School. He was the center and captain for Catholic Central team that won a Detroit city championship. ==College football== Banonis enrolled at the University of Detroit in 1938 and played at the center position (on both offense and defense) for head coach Gus Dorais' Detroit Titans football team from 1939 to 1941. In 1939, Detroit's line coach, Bud Boeringer, who had been an All-American center at Notre Dame, told reporters that he had never had a better candidate for center than Banonis. He was reported to be \\"almost uncanny at diagnosing plays\\" on defense and to be \\"particularly strong on forward pass defense.\\" At the end of the 1941 season, Banonis was chosen as a first-round All-American by Collier's Weekly (selected by Grantland Rice), International News Service, and Paramount News. He was also chosen as a second-team All-American by the Newspaper Enterprise Association. ==Professional football== Banonis was selected by the Chicago Cardinals in the fourth round of the 1942 NFL Draft with the 29th overall pick. Banonis appeared in 11 games for the 1942 Cardinals and intercepted two passes that season. Banonis' football career was interrupted for three years by wartime service in the United States Navy during World War II. He returned to the Cardinals in 1946 and remained with the club through the 1950 season. During his time with the Cardinals, he was selected as a first-team All-NFL player three times (1947, by UPI, 1948, by Chicago Herald Am. and NY Daily News, and 1949, by Int. News Service) and a second-team All-NFL player three times (1946, by NY Daily News, 1948, by Sporting News and UPI, and 1949, by UPI). He intercepted 11 passes from 1946 to 1949 and led the NFL with 83 return yards on two fumble recoveries in 1947. He was a member of the 1947 Cardinals team that won the NFL championship. In July 1950, Banonis' younger brother, Vic Banonis, was signed by the Cardinals after playing college football at Georgetown. However, his brother did not appear in any regular season games in the NFL. In 1951, Banonis was traded by the Cardinals to the Detroit Lions in exchange for offensive lineman Jack Simmons. Banonis appeared in 36 games at center for the Lions from 1951 to 1953 and played on the Lions' NFL championship teams in 1952 and 1953. The Lions signed center Joe Schmidt in 1953, and Banonis appeared in his last professional football game that year at age 32. ==Later years== Banonis has been inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1975) and the College Football Hall of Fame (1986). He died in 2010 at age 89 at Providence Hospital in Southfield, Michigan. He was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1921 births Category:2010 deaths Category:American football centers Category:American football defensive tackles Category:American people of Lithuanian descent Category:Card-Pitt players Category:Chicago Cardinals players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Detroit Titans football players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Iowa Pre- Flight Seahawks football players Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:Sportspeople from Detroit ","title":"Vince Banonis"},{"id":"12353863","text":"Brahea calcarea is a species of palm.

It is very similar to B. odorata, but is easily distinguished from this species by the distinct spathes which are densely covered in rust- coloured, woolly hairs. Indeed, the specific epithet is derived from Greek ἔριον, wool, and Latin spatha, which refers to the spathe. It has been given the name woolly jelly palm (UK) or wooly jelly palm (US) in English. Vernacular names for it where it is native are butiá-da-serra, butiázeiro, butiá-veludo, butiá butiá verdadeiro, butiá-do-campo, yatáy and macumá. ==Taxonomy== In 1970 Sidney Fredrick Glassman moved this species, along with all other Butia, to Syagrus, but in 1979 he changed his mind and moved everything back. ==Description== Butia eriospatha is a solitary-trunked palm tree. The trunk is sometimes inclined to a side, and may occasionally be subterranean. The 20-22 pinnate leaves arch back down towards the trunk and have a petiole armed with teeth spaced along their margins; the rachis of the leaf is 150–220 cm in length. The branched inflorescence develops in a woody, 115–135 cm long spathe covered in a dense woolly indumentum. The pistillate (female) flowers are 5–9mm in length. The shape of the fruit is globose (round), as is the shape of the nuts. Like all species of Butia studied, this species has relatively larger pollen grains than that of other genera of palm present in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. These grains are bilaterally symmetrical, prolate-spheroid, monosulcate, and with the end piriform (pear- shaped). The surface is covered in minute 2μm-large reticulate patterns. ==Distribution== It is native to southern Brazil, where the main bulk of its population is found straddling the highlands in the eastern Santa Catarina/Rio Grande do Sul border regions, surrounded by scattered sub-populations in the southeastern coastal part of the high plateau of the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina. A naturalised population in an area of northern Misiones Province, Argentina, was reported in 2008. Bauermann et al. investigated the possibility of using palm pollen, including this species, in palynology, in order to try to provide more detail about the ancient changes in habitat in the state Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil by tracking the changes in distribution and abundance of the palms, but were unable to provide much detail on the subject. ==Habitat & ecology== Butia eriospatha in its native habitat growing with Araucaria angustifolia in the Tainhas State Park. It is found growing in the Atlantic rainforest biome on a plateau at higher altitudes, between 700 and 1,200m, where it is largely found in grasslands, aggregated in often extensive, dense, almost monoculture palm groves, but higher up also sometimes in open Araucaria forest. These distinctive dense palm groves are known as butiázais in Rio Grande do Sul, but may also be known as butiatuba or butiazal. The caterpillars of the butterflies Brassolis astyra ssp. astyra (fide d'Aralljo & Silva et al. [1968] (=record no. 2362, Butia eriospatha identified as butiázeiro or Cocos sp. in this study)) and B. sophorae (possibly ssp. dinizi) (=no. 2365) have been recorded feeding on B. eriospatha in Santa Catarina. Opsiphanes invirae, the nominate form or possibly subspecies remoliatus, was also recorded feeding on this palm in the same study (=no. 2390, 2392). The caterpillars of the Indonesian butterfly Cephrenes augiades ssp. augiades may also feed on the leaves this palm. Video of Anchylorhynchus eriospathae laying its eggs on the developing flowers of Butia eriospatha. In a long term study observing the feeding behaviour throughout the year of the squirrel Guerlinguetus brasiliensis ssp. ingrami in secondary Araucaria angustifolia forest in the Parque Recreativo Primavera in the vicinity of the city of Curitiba, Paraná, of the ten plant species of which the squirrel ate the seeds or nuts, Butia eriospatha was an uncommon but regular part of the diet in the spring and summer. Mushrooms, seeds of Araucaria angustifolia, nuts of Syagrus romanzoffiana (queen palm) and acorns of Quercus robur (English oak) were the main part of the diet depending on the season. ==Uses== Butia eriospatha is reasonably available in Europe as an ornamental. It is often used in mild temperate climates as a hardy palm for its exotic look. Products obtained from the palm are used locally and are not widely marketed. The fruit pulp is used as a base to make beverages. A wine is made from the palm, as are juices and jellies/jams. Fibres were once harvested from this palm, which were used to make mattresses. Plantations of this palm were planted in the 1950s in Brazil for this purpose. Horticulture It is sometimes cultivated in Brazil and Argentina. It is advised to plant the palms in full sunlight. It is said to take -14 °C, but should be protected at -6 °C in the Netherlands. ==Conservation== The species is widely cultivated, but according to Noblick in 1998, wild populations are declining. It was listed as em perigo (endangered) by the Rio Grande do Sul state government in 2002 (decreto nº 42.099) and 2014 (decreto n° 52.109), because the population is believed to have been reduced by over 50% in at least the last 100 years. In 2012 the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora rated the conservation status for Brazil as 'vulnerable'. ==Gallery== File:Butia eriospatha.jpgNote the teeth along the margins of the leaf petiole on this plant for sale in the USA.

It is locally known as palmeira-jataí, coqueiro- de-vassoura, butiá or coquinho-azedo in Portuguese. The Kalunga people call this palm cabeçudo. ==Etymology== The species epithet is derived from Latin ', meaning 'purple', with the suffix -' meaning 'becoming', which refers to the purple colour of the fruit, flowers and spathe. The Portuguese vernacular name coqueiro-de-vassoura translates as 'broom-coconut' and refers to the main use of this species. The name palmeira-jataí refers to a Brazilian town around which this palm is prominent. ==Taxonomy== It was described by Sidney Fredrick Glassman in 1979, using a holotype he had collected 3 km northeast of the city of Jataí in 1976 (S.F.Glassman13076). ==Description== Morphology Habit This is a solitary-trunked, monoecious palm. Although Glassman described it as 1.2-4m tall in his original description, by 2012 it was known to usually grow to 3-4m, with some individuals reaching 7m in height. Kelen Pureza Soares in his 2015 monograph on the genus Butia gives a height of 1-4m and a trunk diameter of 15–18 cm. This trunk is columnar, growing straight up (never at an angle such as many other caulescent Butia). The trunk is quite slender compared to other caulescent Butia. Leaves The 10-26 leaves are highly arched back towards the trunk, with the total blade length being 77–86 cm. A mature plant with an exposed trunk bears an average of 14 leaves a year. The 83–115 cm petiole of the leaf is unarmed, lacking teeth along its margins. These margins are instead densely fibrous along the lower half of the rachis, becoming less fibrous toward base. The rachis of the leaf is 84–150 cm in length, and has 38-61 pinnae (leaflets) at each side arranged in pairs, more or less evenly spaced, and inserted at an angle on the rachis so that each pair forms a neat 'V'-shape. The pinnae in the middle of the rachis are 45–65 cm long and 1.1–2 cm wide. The apex (tips) of the pinnae are long- acuminate and asymmetrical. The colour of the leaves has been described as bright green, bluish-green or bluish-grey. The leaves are pinnate. The leaf development is constant throughout the year, but leaf emission peaks during periods with higher temperature and rainfall (usually December, January and February) and are lowest in colder, drier months (June and July). Inflorescence The branched, monoecious inflorescence has a 12–30 cm long prophyll. The inflorescence develops within a woody, glabrous (hairless) spathe which eventually grows 70–105 cm in total length, and has a swollen portion at the end 61–81 cm long and 6–13 cm wide. This swollen portion is often coloured purplish and the whole spathe may sometimes be smooth or striate. The inflorescence has a 35–60 cm long peduncle. The rachis of the inflorescence is 25–49 cm long and has 51-90 rachillae (branches) which are 8–32 cm long. Both sexes of the flowers are coloured purple, although according to Nigel Kembrey, a British horticulturist specialised in Butia, some forms may have yellow flowers. The staminate (male) flowers are 6–7mm in length and have a prominent pedicel (stalk). The pistillate (female) flowers are more or less globose (round), 5–6mm in length, and with sepals and petals about equal in size. Spathe appearance is opposite to that of leaf emission, with spathes developing after the season of high temperatures and rainfall, with the emission peak happening at the end of the rainy season (usually May to July). There are individual plants in some state of flowering in the population throughout the year. Fruit The shape of the fruit is ovoid, as is the nut. The ripe fruit is 2.3–3 cm long, 1-1.5 cm wide and have a juicy, acidic-sweet flesh. The nut contains 1 to 2 seeds. The ripe fruit is generally the colour purple (or 'wine'), although some forms also carry yellow fruit. The fruit has a beak 4-5mm in length and a persistent perianth 7-8mm high. The nut is rather small for a Butia. Infraspecific diversity Renata Corrêa Martins in her thesis on the palms of Goiás notes that the population at different localities may differ from each other, with the northern population in Cavalcante having much smaller trunks than the palms found in southeastern Goiás. Similar species It is the only species of Butia without teeth or spines on the petiole which has purple-coloured spathes, flowers and fruit (at maturity). Glassman in 1979 considered it superficially similar to B. capitata (which included B. odorata at the time), differing primarily from that by the lack of teeth along the margins of the petioles, the long acuminate tips of the pinnae (leaflets) as opposed to obtuse or acute, and the generally purplish spathes, spadices, flowers and fruit. He considered it closely related to B. archeri due to the similar pinnae, the lack of teeth on the petioles, and sizes and shapes of its fruit and flowers, yet differing in always possessing an above-ground trunk, in its larger dimensions of leaves and inflorescences, and in the purplish colour of its flowers and fruit. In 2015, after many more species had been discovered, Soares continued to consider it the most similar to B. archeri, but this species is distinguishable from B. purpurascens by having much smaller dimensions of its trunk, leaves and inflorescence. In Goiás, where most of the population resides, the species B. archeri and B. capitata also occur, although they do not necessarily all occur together. ==Distribution== It occurs in southern, western and eastern Goiás, western Minas Gerais and northeastern Mato Grosso do Sul, three inland states of southern central Brazil. Up until 2018, many publications state that this species is endemic to southwestern Goiás, but it was collected in Minas Gerais already in 1987, and as of 2018, with further sampling of the flora, its known range has expanded considerably. In 1998 the IUCN reported that a single, but large and quite healthy population occurred near Jataí, largely protected within the confines of a military reservation (41º BIMTZ), but as of 2017 it is known from at least fourteen localities. These are in the municipalities of Aparecida do Rio Doce, Cachoeira Alta, Caçu, Cavalcante, Jataí, Perolândia and Rio Verde in Goiás, and Ituiutaba and Patrocínio in the Triângulo Mineiro area of Minas Gerais. It is particularly prominent around the city of Jataí, with the palms growing at visibly high densities. The total area of occupancy (AOO) was estimated to be only 3,762 km2 in 2012, but in 2017 the AOO was estimated to be 1,645 km2, while the extent of occurrence (EOO) was estimated to be 10,100 km2, which means that the species has an abundance of 16%, which is very low compared to the other species in the genus Butia. ==Ecology== Habitat It grows in cerrado. In Cavalcante it occurs in cerrado plains sensu stricto, in places with well-drained soils and usually sparse tree cover. Densities of 880 to 1379 woody plants per hectare have been recorded for the palm grove areas, with a mean of 89 adult palms a hectare. Palm density is highest in areas with sparse woody vegetation. It often grows together with Syagrus flexuosa, Attalea and Allagoptera palms. The soils it grows in are well-draining oxisols which are dark red or purple near the larger watercourses. Reproduction Plants may flower at a very young age. From year to year the flowering can be erratic, with some years having few trees flowering. According to Pablo Viany Prieto in his report for the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora it fruits throughout the year, and according to Martins in her doctoral thesis it has been collected flowering in November and fruiting in February, August and November. The plants have protandrous dichogamy, this is because the male flowers, located at the end of the rachillae flower first, with the female flowers in the centre of the inflorescence flowering after the male ones senesce, thus promoting outcrossing. Female floral anthesis shows no correlation with climate, although significant differences exist between sites. Fruiting begins in June with immature fruit, with fruiting occurring during the cool, dry season. Usually, several immature fruits are aborted and dropped before maturation. Maturation occurs in August, and the fruit can remain on the infructescence until dispersion from September to January. In a natural population, approximately 30% to 50% of the individuals bear ripe fruit, although many more bore infructescences with immature fruit. The age structure of the extant population shows a pattern of periods of high germination success alternated with longer periods of low fecundity. Interspecies relationships Hemi-epiphytic figs may grow on the trunks. ==Uses== In its native palm groves near Jataí the fruit is harvested and gathered from the wild, commonly for use to make locally consumed juices. A liquor is also made from them in some areas by soaking the fruit in spirits or white rum. The leaves are harvested for use in making brooms, in many areas likely beyond sustainable levels. Leaves are only harvested from mature specimens with trunks. Among the Kalunga of the village of Engenho II in Cavalcante, Goiás, one person has used the leaves as incense in semi-Catholic rituals. Horticulture It can be used as an ornamental. Seeds have been commercially available from speciality vendors since at least 2004. In Brazil, fully grown specimens are available from nurseries. It is advised to plant the palms in full sunlight. Plants are very slow growing. They are drought and wind resistant. It is likely not hardy. It is said to take 0 °C, but should be protected at 10 °C in the Netherlands. Kembrey claims it can take -6 °C and that the USDA hardiness zone is 9b. ==Conservation== Noblick, writing for the IUCN in 1998, mentioned high seed predation by 'bean weevils' as a possible threat to the species, and due to this and its limited range classified it as 'vulnerable'. In 2012 the Centro Nacional de Conservação da Flora rated the conservation status for Brazil as 'endangered', primarily due to an already restricted distribution and habitat loss due to the many decades of ongoing mining and the pressure of agricultural expansion, as well as the gathering of fruit by local people and tourists, and a high juvenile mortality (see ecology section above). In a 2017 dissertation by Marcelo Piske Eslabão he advocates considering the species as 'critically endangered' as the IUCN categories B1ab(i, ii, iii) and B2ab(i, ii, iii) applied, although Eslabão does not adequately explain which criteria exactly applies, as some clearly do not (B1 (EOO (see distribution section above) below 100 km2) and B2 (AOO below 10 km2). This would likely mean that the population was estimated to have declined by 90% or more within 10 years or 3 generations, in which a number of other qualifications might apply, such as an observed decrease in quality of habitat, and/or estimated AOO or EOO. Eslabão elaborates that intense overexploitation of the leaves for broom construction is causing very apparent alterations and excessive mortality in many populations. Martins also relates how the continual leaf extraction results in reduced plant size and an altered look to the palms. Studies by Guilherme et al. illustrate how continued leaf extraction can result in a significantly lower proportion of the palms flowering and thus reproducing, and much later fruit maturation, and that leaf production in populations under high leaf extraction pressure is reduced. Much of the region in which it grows has been converted to use for agricultural activities such as cattle, corn, soybean and increasingly sugar cane. The palm groves also show ecological disturbances in the form of infestation by invasive grasses and fires. A portion of the population is protected within the confines of a military reservation (41º BIMTZ), although it does not occur in any official conservation areas. ==References== purpurascens Category:Endemic flora of Brazil Category:Flora of the Cerrado Category:Flora of Goiás Category:Vulnerable flora of South America Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Butia purpurascens"},{"id":"12353892","text":"Calamus compsostachys is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

The species name obtecta derives from the Latin obtegere (to conceal, to cover up), alluding to the way the inflorescence barely protruded beyond the leaves in the plant first described. ==Distribution== On Norfolk Island, C. obtecta grows in forest on Mt Bates, Mt Pitt, and elsewhere in the National Park. In New Zealand it was first described as C. kaspar and was thought to be restricted to the Three Kings Islands, 55 km north of the North Island. Later it was found on the North Island at North Cape, and on Murimotu Island and the Poor Knights Islands. In 2005, C. kaspar was relegated to synonymy with C. obtecta. ==Description== Foliage and fruiting panicle of Cordyline obtecta C. obtecta is a cabbage tree up to tall (generally much less), with a stout trunk in diameter. It has spreading branches covered with densely clustered stiff leaves that appear in tufts at the tips of the branches. The leaves are long, and wide, narrowing towards their bases into short leaf stems about wide. The leaves droop somewhat as they age. The flowers of C. obtecta are borne in many large, open branched panicles that appear among the leaves. The flowers are each about in diameter, and are very strongly scented. The fruit is a spherical berry in diameter, whitish or purplish blue. The bark on the trunk is grey and flaky. ==Threats== On Norfolk Island many populations of C. obtecta are threatened outside the national park, and it is listed as 'vulnerable' under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 The New Zealand Plant Conservation Network lists the plant as 'At Risk/Range Restricted'. It also occasionally hybridises in New Zealand with C. australis, the characteristics of the resultant plants being intermediate to those of the parents. ==Cultivation== C. obtecta is an attractive small tree which tolerates full sun but prefers shade when young. It is intolerant of wet conditions and is likely to be sensitive to frost. There are at least two commercially available cultivars which are becoming popular for street planting and for home gardens. 'Green Goddess' (probably of Three Kings origin) has slightly glaucous, matte-surfaced leaves and stiffly upright fruit panicles. 'Emerald Goddess' (probably from Norfolk Island) has glossy grass- green leaves and lax panicles. ==NotesReferences== *Salmon J T, The Native Trees of New Zealand, AH & AW Reed, Wellington, New Zealand, 1973. * * Category:Asparagales of Australia obtecta Category:Trees of Australia Category:Trees of New Zealand Category:Flora of Norfolk Island Category:Flora of the North Island Category:Taxa named by John Gilbert Baker Category:Taxa named by Robert Graham ","title":"Cordyline obtecta"},{"id":"12353915","text":"Carpoxylon macrospermum is a species of palm tree endemic to Vanuatu, and the only species in the genus Carpoxylon.

(2005). World Checklist of Palms: 1-223. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The species are almost exclusively montane and include the tallest palm (and thus tallest monocotyledon), C. quindiuense, which reaches in height, and species growing at the highest altitude of the palm family (Arecaceae), at more than in elevation. The genus name is derived from Latin (\\"wax\\") and Ancient Greek (, \\"wood\\"). ==Description== Ceroxylon palms develop single, smooth, wax-covered, often whitish cylindrical trunks encircled by ringed leafbase scars. Ceroxylon species are dioecious (the individual plant produces flowers of only one sex). Leaves are pinnate. Inflorescences emerge from among, and often project conspicuously beyond, the leaves. Round fruits, up to one inch in diameter, are red or orange at maturity. Many Ceroxylon species are endangered by habitat destruction. Two species of Andean wax palms, C. quindiuense and C. alpinum, provide nesting sites and food for a species of Colombian parrot now in danger of extinction, Ognorhynchus icterotis. ==Cultivation== Several Ceroxylon species, including C. quindiuense, C. alpinum, C. vogelianum, C. ventricosum, and C. parvifrons, are cultivated as ornamental trees outside their native range in cool, humid, mild climates with minimal frosts, such as parts of Australia, coastal California, Hawai'i, New Zealand, South Africa, and coastal Western Europe. The Jose Celestino Mutis Botanical Garden in Bogotá, Colombia, contains an extensive planting of Ceroxylon palms. Other public gardens where cultivated Ceroxylon spp. can be viewed include the San Francisco Botanical Garden in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California, the Huntington Botanical Gardens, in Pasadena (near Los Angeles), California, and the Oakland Palmetum at the Lakeside Garden Center in Oakland, California. ==Species== The genus contains the following species: {  - !

At John F. Kennedy High School he performed in a series of bands. By the early 1970s he gained renown as a San Francisco Bay Area musician, playing with such Bay Area groups as Clover, The Moonlighters led by Bill Kirchen, and Elvin Bishop. In early 1976 Buffalo joined the \\"farewell\\" European tour of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, and was recorded on the band's final live album We've Got a Live One Here!,We've Got a Live One Here, Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmenok, Amazon.com, 1976 which included Buffalo's song \\"Eighteen Wheels.\\" After the tour, Buffalo returned to California, briefly played with a number of local bands, and later in 1976 he joined the Steve Miller Band's Fly Like an Eagle Tour. He also played harmonica on the band's hit follow-up album Book of Dreams, released in May 1977. Buffalo appeared on the tracks \\"Winter Time\\" and \\"The Stake.\\" By the late 1970s Buffalo had formed his own band, The Stampede, and recorded two Capitol Records albums: Lovin' in the Valley of the Moon and Desert Horizon. In 1977 his harmonica work appeared on Bonnie Raitt's Sweet Forgiveness and The Doobie Brothers' Livin' on the Fault Line albums. Not long after the release of his second album in 1979, Buffalo and his band were featured on the PBS music television program Austin City Limits. In 1981 he produced an album for the popular Northwest band Wheatfield. He was a member of the Mickey Hart band High Noon in the late 70s and early 80s with Merl Saunders, Mike Hinton, Jim McPhearson, Vicki Randle, and Bobby Vega, and played with Saunders on the Rainforest Band album It's in the Air in 1993. Buffalo was legendary among harpists (harmonicists) for his solo on Bonnie Raitt's treatment of Del Shannon's \\"Runaway\\", in which he switches quickly between four different harps (F, E♭, D♭, and C) to play across the chord changes in the song (Cm, B♭, A♭, G). An example of Buffalo's solo on \\"Runaway\\" can be seen on Bonnie Raitt's portion of the \\"Midnight Special\\" TV program broadcast on June 10, 1977, entitled \\"Little Feat and Friends.\\" Buffalo also appeared in and worked on several films. He did a cameo appearance in the rock movie, The Rose starring Bette Midler, where he was a member of the band (on harmonica and trombone) and spoke a line or two. He had another cameo in Michael Cimino's 1979 film Heaven's Gate starring Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston and Jeff Bridges. He also co- wrote the music for the films Stacy's Knights, and Eddie Macon's Run with guitarist Mike Hinton. Norton performed and recorded as a member of The Steve Miller Band for over 32 years. He often performed and recorded music as a session musician, and appeared on 180 albums. A cover of Buffalo's song Ain't No Bread in the Breadbox was in heavy rotation at Jerry Garcia Band concerts from 1991 until Jerry Garcia's death in 1995, and appeared on the live release Shining Star. On September 2, 2009, Buffalo was diagnosed with stage four adenocarcinoma of the lower right lobe of the lung. The next day, he found out that it had spread to his brain. Norton retired to his home in Paradise, California, where he sought treatment at Feather River Hospital. He died on October 30, 2009, in Feather River Hospital. As a benefit for the Buffalo family, friends of Buffalo threw \\"A Celebration of Life: Tribute To Norton Buffalo\\" at the Fox Theater in Oakland, California. Headlined by the Steve Miller Band, the event honored his life and career. Other acts and performers included The Doobie Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, Huey Lewis, George Thorogood, Elvin Bishop, and Carlos Reyes. ==Awards== Buffalo played harmonica on two tracks on The Doobie Brothers' Grammy-award-winning 1978 album Minute by Minute. He was also nominated for a Grammy in 1992 for \\"Best Country Instrumental Performance\\" for the tune \\"Song for Jessica\\" from his 1991 duet album R&B; with Guitarist Roy Rogers on Blind Pig Records. ==Discography== * Lovin' in the Valley of the Moon (1977), Capitol Records * Desert Horizon (1978), Capitol * R & B (1991), Blind Pig Records – with slide guitarist Roy Rogers * Travellin’ Tracks (1992), Blind Pig – with Roy Rogers * Here Comes the Rain (1993), Rounder Records – guest artist appearing with Laurie Lewis * It's in the Air (1993), Summertone – guest artist appearing with Merl Saunders & the Rainforest Band * In the Third Degree (1996), Mirage Independent – guest artist appearing with James Ibold and the Impostors * King of the Highway (2000), Blind Pig *Christmas Jug Band- Uncorked (2002) Guest artist singing I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

Some are upright trees, while others creep along the ground. Species are used for thatch, to weave hats, stuff pillows and as a source of salt. ==Description== Chelyocarpus is a type of small to medium- sized, single or multi-stemmed palms with fan shaped leaves. Stems range from short and creeping along the ground to as much as tall. Stem diameters range from . Individuals have between 10 and 20 leaves with circular blades, the lower surface of which is usually whitish in colour. The flowers are small and bisexual—they have both male and female sex organs in the same flower. The fruit have one or two seeds and ripen to a greenish yellow or brown. ==Taxonomy== The name Chelyocarpus is derived from Ancient Greek and means \\"turtle carapace-fruited\\", a reference to cracked surface of the fruits of the genus, which resemble the shell of a turtle. The species was first described by German botanist Carl Dammer in 1920. In the first edition of Genera Palmarum (1987), Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus Chelyocarpus in subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Corypheae and subtribe Thrinacinae Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Old World and New World members of Thrinacinae are not closely related. As a consequence, Chelyocarpus and related genera have been placed in their own tribe, Cryosophileae. Chelyocarpus is considered to form the sister clade to the rest of the tribe. ==Distribution== Three species of Chelyocarpus are native to the western Amazon, while the fourth is from western Colombia. Chelyocarpus chuco is found in Brazil and Bolivia, C. ulei in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil, C. repens near Iquitos, Peru, and C. dianeurus is found in the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. ==Uses== The leaves of Chelyocarpus chuco are used for thatch and to weave hats.

Species in the genus can be readily distinguished from related genera by their distinctive downward-pointing spines on the stem, which are actually modified roots. They are known as the \\"root spine palms\\". ==Description== Cryosophila is a genus of medium-sized, single-stemmed (or rarely multi-stemmed) palms with fan-shaped (or palmate) leaves and spiny stems. The stems range in height from , with diameters between . Plants have between five and 35 leaves with elongated petioles. The leaves are often whitish-grey on the lower surface. The whitish flowers are bisexual with six stamens and three carpels. The fruit are white and smooth, with a single seed. Cryosophila is distinguished from related genera by its long, branched spines which are derived from modified roots. These downward-pointing spines cover the trunk, often quite densely. The genus is one of the few palms which use modified roots as spines, and its spines are unlike any others in morphology or appearance. The density of spines varies from less than 25 over a length of stem in some species to others where the entire stem is covered by a dense mass of spines. ==Taxonomy== In the first edition of Genera Palmarum (1987), Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus Cryosophila in subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Corypheae and subtribe Thrinacinae Subsequent phylogenetic analyses showed that the Old World and New World members of Thrinacinae are not closely related. As a consequence, Cryosophila and related genera were places in their own tribe, Cryosophileae. Within this tribe, Cryosophila appears to be most closely related to the genus Schippia. History The earliest botanical description of the species in the genus were made by Alexander von Humboldt, Aimé Bonpland and Carl Sigismund Kunth in 1816. They named two species, Corypha nana and Chamaerops mocini. Although these species were placed in different genera (both of which are now considered to be restricted to the Old World), today they are both thought to represent the same species—Cryosophila nana. In 1838 or 1839 Carl Ludwig Blume coined the name Cryosophila specifically for C. nana, but did not actually publish the combination and it was only validated in 1887 with the publication of Blume's combination by Carl E. Salomon in 1887. German botanist Hermann Wendland established a new genus, Acanthorrhiza, in 1869. He included two species in the genus, A. aculeata, which he transferred from Trithrinax where it had been placed by Danish botanist Frederik Michael Liebmann when he described it in 1853, and A. warscewiczii, for which Wendland provided the first description. Acanthorrhiza aculeata was based on a specimen now considered to belong to C. nana, but was defined in such a way that it also included another species, C. stauracantha. It was not until 1935 that American botanist Harley Bartlett realised that A. aculeata was the same as the pair of species that had been described by Kunth. Both Corypha nana and Chamaerops mocini had been published at the same time in the same work,Corypha nana on page 299 of Nova genera et species plantarum quas in peregrinatione ad plagam aequinoctialem orbis novi collegerunt Bonpland et Humboldt, Chamaerops mocini on page 300 which meant that Bartlett had to designate a basionym, the \\"original\\" validly published name for the species. Bartlett chose the former, and went on to describe three new species. Paul H. Allen described two new species in 1953, bringing the total number of species to seven. Based on Randall J. Evans' doctoral dissertation, Henderson and colleagues recognised nine species in the genus, although they expressed the concern that the fragmentation of populations by habitat destruction may have exaggerated the difference between remaining populations, leading to an overestimate in the number of species. In his 1995 monograph on the genus, Evans recognised 10 species and two subspecies.

They were named for Queen Charlotte, consort of George III. Formed as a light corps in the tradition of the ranging companies in British service during the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War), the Queen's Rangers operated on the flanks and in advance of Crown forces, manning outposts and patrolling, as well as carrying out reconnaissance and raiding operations. A small number of Black Loyalists, who had served in the Black Brigade and Butler's Rangers, were later merged into the Queen's Rangers. After the war, the Rangers moved to the British Nova Scotia colony, now Saint John, New Brunswick, and disbanded, but were re-formed in Upper Canada before disbanding again in 1802. ==French and Indian War== The origins of the Queen's Rangers began in the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War), during which France and Great Britain fought for territories in the New World. At first, French-Canadian habitants and their Indian allies were quite effective by employing guerrilla tactics against the British regulars. To counter the French tactics, Robert Rogers raised companies of New England frontiersmen for the British and trained them in woodcraft, scouting, and irregular warfare, sending them on raids along the frontiers of French Canada as Rogers' Rangers. The Rangers soon gained a considerable reputation, particularly in the campaigning in upstate New York around Fort Ticonderoga and Lake Champlain. They also launched a long-range raid to destroy Indian allies in the St. Lawrence valley, gained the first lodgement in the amphibious landings on Cape Breton to capture Louisbourg, and took the surrender of the French outposts in the Upper Great Lakes at the conclusion of the war. ==American Revolutionary War== When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, about fifty Loyalist regiments were raised, including the Butler's Rangers, the King's Royal Regiment, and the Maryland and Pennsylvania Loyalists. Robert Rogers again raised a unit, this time in New York (mostly from Loyalists living in Westchester and Long Island), from western Connecticut, and with men from the Queen's Loyal Virginia Regiment.Katcher, p.98 The new unit was named in honour of Queen Charlotte, the wife of King George III. It first assembled on Staten Island in August 1776 and grew to 937 officers and men, organized into eleven companies of about thirty men each, and an additional five troops of cavalry. The unit immediately set about building fortresses and redoubts, including the one that stood at Lookout Place. Rogers did not prove successful in this command and he left the unit on January 29, 1777. The regiment had suffered serious losses in the Battle of Mamaroneck, a surprise attack on their outpost position at Mamaroneck, New York, on October 22, 1776. Eleven months later, on September 11, 1777, they distinguished themselves at the Battle of Brandywine, suffering many casualties while attacking entrenched American positions. They were then commanded by Major James Wemyss. On October 15, 1777, John Graves Simcoe was given command, when the unit became known informally as \\"Simcoe's Rangers\\".See mentions as in various contemporary reports e.g. By W. T. Sherwin, W.T. & Carlile, Richard, The Republican, Volume 9, London, 1824, pp.98-100 John Graves Simcoe turned the Queen's Rangers into one of the most successful British regiments in the war. They provided escort and patrol duty around Philadelphia (1777–8); fought in the Philadelphia Campaign; served as rearguard during the British retreat to New York (1778); fought the Stockbridge Militia in The Bronx (1778); fought on October 26, 1779, at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where Simcoe was captured but freed in a prisoner exchange on December 31, 1779; at Charlestown, South Carolina (1780); in the raid on Richmond, Virginia with Benedict Arnold and in other raids in Virginia (1780–1). The unit surrendered at Yorktown and its rank and file were imprisoned at Winchester, Virginia. Earlier, on May 2, 1779 the regiment was taken into the American establishment as the 1st American Regiment and was later, on December 25, 1782, taken into the British establishment. In 1783, when the war was ended by the Treaty of Paris, the Queen's Rangers left New York for Nova Scotia, where it was disbanded. Many of the men from the unit formed Queensbury, New Brunswick on land grants. ==Post-war years== After 1791, when Simcoe was named lieutenant governor of the newly created Upper Canada, the Queen's Rangers was revived to form the core of the defence forces. The leaders were mostly veterans of the American War of Independence. Although there was little military action during this period, the Rangers were instrumental in building Upper Canada through Simcoe's road building campaign. In 1795–6 they blazed the trail for Yonge Street, and then turned to Dundas Street and Kingston Road. They also built the original Fort York, where they were stationed. The Queen's Rangers were again disbanded in 1802 with most of the men joining the York Militia—from which many would take an active role in the War of 1812. During the Rebellions of 1837, Samuel Peters Jarvis raised a new Queen's Rangers out of the York Militia to fight the rebels, which again disbanded soon after being raised. ==Legacy== A Canadian Army Reserve Regiment called The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) (RCAC) traces its roots to the original Rogers' Rangers.The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment): History Retrieved 11/02/12. In 2012 the Rangers were assigned the perpetuation of three War of 1812 units and received battle honours accordingly.The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) (RCAC) Retrieved 11/02/12.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and after that served in the Soviet Navy as T-280. The Soviets converted her into a naval trawler in 1948 and renamed her Taifun. ==Construction and commissioning== Penetrate was laid down at Chickasaw, Alabama, by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation on 5 January 1943. She was launched on 11 September 1943, sponsored by Miss Frances M. Moyer, and commissioned on 31 March 1944 with Lieutenant M. S. Lazaron, Jr., in command. ==Service history== U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945 On 14 April 1944, Penetrate stood downriver from Chickasaw to the Gulf of Mexico and from there proceeded to the United States East Coast and shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay. By late May 1944, she was undergoing training in Casco Bay, Maine, and, on 1 June 1944, she steamed north to Naval Station Argentia in the Dominion of Newfoundland, where she was converted to a weather ship. For the next six months she patrolled on weather reporting duties in the North Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and Canada to track and record changes in the polar maritime air masses affecting the European battlefronts and the transatlantic air routes. In early January 1945, Penetrates meteorological instruments were removed and minesweeping gear was reinstalled. On 31 January 1945 she headed south to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, arriving there on 7 February 1945 for an abbreviated overhaul. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Penetrate departed Philadelphia on 27 February 1945, transited the Panama Canal, and proceeded to Cold Bay, where she arrived on 15 April 1945 and began familiarization training for her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. Soviet Navy, 1945-1960 Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Penetrate was decommissioned on 22 May 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-280 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she entered service with the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Penetrate to the United States, instead converting her into a naval trawler in 1948 and renaming her Taifun. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-271 on 7 February 1955. ==Disposal== The ship was scrapped in 1960.

It is the only surviving Standard Class 5 built by British Railways which was fitted with Caprotti valve gear. == Locomotive History == 73129 was outshopped from Derby Works in August 1956. It was one of 30 built fitted with Caprotti valve gear. Originally allocated at Shrewsbury Shed (which required the fitting of GWR style lamp brackets), it was later transferred to Patricroft Shed (near Manchester) in 1958. It spent the rest of its working life there until it was stored at Patricroft from June to November 1967. It was officially withdrawn from traffic on 2 December 1967. During 73129's working life, it covered roughly 198,359 miles - 35,814 of those in 1957. ==Barry Scrapyard== In February 1968, 73129 was sent to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. In 1972, 73129 was purchased by the Midland Railway Project Group. Preparation work for the transportation of the locomotive to Butterley was undertaken at Woodham Brothers with small working parties. In addition, many spare parts were acquired from other locomotives, especially 73129's neighbour at Barry, 73096, which is now itself preserved. Parts were also taken from the only other remaining Caprotti valve geared locomotive at Woodham Brothers, 71000 \\"Duke of Gloucester\\", which is also now preserved. Whilst stored at Woodham Brothers, the original BR1B tender (1417) was sold to a steel works for conversion into an ingot carrier. 73129 currently has tender number 1043. It is of the same BR1B type, but has no water pick-up apparatus, as it was from a Southern Region based engine 75079 where there was no need for the apparatus. ==Transportation to Butterley== On 6 January 1973 a convoy from Barry hauled by a British Rail Class 46 number (D)157 took 73129 on part of its journey to Derby Works. The convoy also included 7819 \\"Hinton Manor\\", 4141 and 5164, 4930 \\"Hagley Hall\\", a Stanier 4000 gallon tender and a brake van. Assistance out of Woodham Brothers scrapyard was given by a Class 37 diesel (or English Electric Type 3 as they were known) 6978. At Kidderminster whilst dropping off the locomotives for the Severn Valley Railway the motive power was changed to a Class 25 (or Sulzer Type 2) 7655. 73129 was left at Derby Works as a temporary home. By early 1975, 73129 along with Jinty 16440 (47357) had arrived at Butterley. ==Restoration== Restoration was started on a limited scale on 73129 shortly after the locomotive arrived at the then Midland Railway Centre, now Midland Railway - Butterley, in 1975 although work began to tail off in around 1985. Another small attempt to restart the restoration was tried in 1992 although minimal work was carried out due to lack of financial and human resources. In late 1993, restoration began in earnest. This took over a decade. The first fire in 73129's firebox since 1967 was lit at 3.25 pm on 22 February 2004.

It is found only in Madagascar where it is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== Dypsis ambositrae is an elegant palm that grows a moderately sized, smooth, ringed trunk to about tall that carries a grayish crownshaft and a crown of gracefully arching, V-shaped leaves with the stiff leaflets drooping at the tip. Generally a solitary palm, but, like many dypsis, often splits and doubles or even triples at or above ground elevation. It usually stays solitary when in regularly burnt terrain. This is a heeled, tillering dypsis. Trunk: 3–7 meters tall, 12 cm in diameter; internodes 10–20 cm apart, pale brown to grey colored (green and ringed when young), nodal scars 0.5 cm, grey; wood hard; base of stem slightly wider, with some surface roots; slight bulge in upper trunk in one older tree; crownshaft pale waxy grey-green. Crown holds 7-11 leaves, spiral, gracefully arching, with stiff pinnae; crownshaft 64–103 cm. long, pale green with a white bloom, ligules 2 cm.; petiole 3–30 cm. long, 3-6 x 2.2-4.5 cm. in diam., channelled with soft edges; rachis 2.1-2.8 m., in mid-leaf 2.2-3.5 cm. wide, green; pinnae 74-84 on each side of the rachis, grouped only very slightly in 2s-5s, in one plane, the pinnae on opposite sides of the rachis at an angle of roughly 130° +-, stiff with only the apices pendulous, apices attenuate, unequally bifid, the proximal 69-144 x 0.3-1.8 cm., (first interval c. 29 cm., more distal 3.5–9 cm.), median 89-114 x 2.3–3 cm (leaflet interval 0.2–2 cm, group interval 2-3.5 cm), distal 18-58 x 0.8-2.5 cm, abaxially with distant tufts of pale grey ramenta over almost whole length of midrib, with scattered scales very faint to invisible, main veins faint, with only the midrib very prominent on the adaxial surface. Inflorescence: Interfoliar, branched to 2 (3 in a few cases) orders, with the basal part within the closed sheath, the prophyll hidden and the peduncular bract spreading from the top of the sheath; peduncle 68–123 cm. long, distally 9 x 5 cm. in diam., green, glabrous, curved outside the sheath; prophyll c. 91 cm., borne at 32 cm. above the base of the peduncle, 11.5 cm. wide, narrowly 2-winged; peduncular bract deciduous, about 80 cm., beaked (about 5 cm.) and closed distally, pale waxy grey, inserted about 48 cm. from the base of the peduncle; open peduncular bract 14 x 7 cm.; rachis 84–102 cm., with 23-24 branched and 14-17 unbranched first order branches, in a few cases some of the proximal branches branched twice more, but not more than 3 in the entire inflorescence; all axes green with white bloom; first order branches proximally 2-3 x 0.5–1 cm.; rachillae 14–32 cm., 3–4 mm. in diam., with flattish base and distant to rather dense triads, hardly sunken in slight pits with entire, obtuse or acute bracts. Staminate flowers with sepals 2.2-2.5 x 1.6-2.2 mm., keeled, gibbous at the base, broadly ovate, obtuse, the margins membranous; petals connate for 0.2-0.5 mm., the free lobes 2.8-3 x 2.8-3.2 mm., ovate or elliptic, acute, sometimes with hooded apex; stamens 6, uniseriate, the filaments connate for 0.2-0.5 mm., 2.8-3.2 mm. long, anthers 2.1-2.3 x 1 mm.; pistillode 2.2-2.3 mm., columnar, 0.8–1 mm. in diam. Pistillate flowers with sepals 2.4-3 x 3-4.1 mm., broadly ovate, rounded; petals hardly connate at the base, 3.5-4.1 x 4–5 mm., imbricate but for the apiculate apex, broadly ovate, concave; staminodes 6, 0.3-1.6 mm., narrow and flat; ovary asymmetrical, 2.7-4.8 x 2.8–4 mm., with indistinct pyramidal stigmas. Fruit only known from carbonized remnants, about 14 x 10.5 mm., possibly with fibrous endocarp, possibly with ruminate endosperm. ==Taxonomy== With its slightly grouped pinnae, and glabrous inflorescences branched to 2 orders, this species is allied to D. oreophila and D. tsaratananensis, from which it is easily distinguishable by its larger crownshaft, longer leaves with larger pinnae, the much longer inflorescences, and the larger fruit. ==Distribution and habitat== High plateau in Central Madagascar alt. in central Madagascar, near Ambositra. Open forest habitat and plateaus; among rocks or in riverine forest remnants, medium or steep mid slope; where a few plants survive in forest remnants. Recently has also been discovered growing in locations shared by Dypsis decipiens. ==Conservation notes== Conservation status: Critical. In 1992 twelve trees of this species were known, all growing in or next to agricultural areas; in 1994, at least five of these had been cut down or burnt. ==Cultivation and availability== This palm has only recently been brought into cultivation. Initial seeds were brought in under the name 'dypsis ambositrae' that turned out to be another species now identified as dypsis plumosa. More recent seed introductions appear to be the real dypsis ambositrae. This is a palm from the higher elevations of Madagascar and exhibits reasonable adaptation to cool subtropical and mild mediterranean and mild temperate regions of the world. It is hardy to radiational freezes of short duration down to about 27F. Full sun to part shade, tolerates dry atmospheric conditions but requires warm, moist soil conditions. This is a tillering saxophone-style heeled dypsis similar to sabal: plant the heel above ground in well-draining soil to prevent rotting. ==References== * J. Dransfield and H. Beentje.

It infects grapevines, causing chlorosis of the leaves and lowering the fruit quality.P. Andret-Link et al. Journal of Plant Pathology (2004), 86(3), 183–195 Because of its effect on grape yield, GFLV is a pathogen of commercial importance. It is transmitted via a nematode vector, Xiphinema index. This nematode acquires the virus through feeding on roots of an infected plant, and passes it on in the same manner. Host and Symptoms: The host for Grapevine fanleaf virus or GFLV is the vitis species. This includes V. vinifera, V. rupestris, and hybrids. The symptoms of GFLV are “distortion of leaves and may cause unusual chlorotic (yellow) patterns on leaves, such as a yellow mosaic or yellow veins.”(5) Plants infected with GFLV also will have a reduced size and the fruit will be softer when compared to fruit from healthy plants. The leaves will be “severely distorted, asymmetrical, cupped and puckered, and exhibit acute dentations”, these symptoms tend to look like a fan, hence the name fanleaf virus. The canes may also show signs of abnormal branching, double nodding, and short internodes. Affected vines can also show signs of yellow mosaic which may affect all parts of the vine. The berries of the plant have a reduced yield and are smaller. They also have irregular ripening times.(4) Disease Cycle: The disease is spread by Xiphinema index a dagger nematode. The typical life cycle of Xiphinema index nematode goes through 6 life cycle stages. The females lay the eggs into the soil. Once the juveniles hatch from the egg they go through 4 molting stages where they get bigger after each molt. The nematode feeds and attacks the plant at all stages except when it's an egg. It uses its stylist to feed on the plant. During the feeding the nematode secretes enzymes into the plant to digest plant cells. During the feeding process the nematode can transfer the disease into the plant and it is also at this point that the nematode can become a carrier of the pathogen if it is not one already.(6) Management: To prevent GFLV planting certified disease free plants will make it so that the nematodes can not spread the disease unless they already have the pathogen. Another prevention method is the disinfect the pruning tools between each plant to help reduce the amount of disease spread from humans. An additional way to manage the disease is to get rid of any diseased plants and before the season starts test the soil for GLFV.(7) Finally, you can cover the crops with nematicidal properties and deep plow the fields and use nematode resistant rootstocks.(5) == External links == * ICTVdB—The Universal Virus Database: Grapevine fanleaf virus * Family Groups—The Baltimore Method * Taxonomy Browser at PDBe == References == Category:Nepoviruses Category:Viral grape diseases ","title":"Grapevine fanleaf virus"},{"id":"12354283","text":"Dypsis arenarum is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

Other common names include blue angelfish, golden angelfish, queen angel, and yellow angelfish.Pyle, R., et al. 2010. Holacanthus ciliaris. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2. Downloaded on 03 June 2013. Holocanthus ciliaris should not be confused with Holocanthus bermudensis, or the (Bermuda) blue angelfish, despite very similar appearances. They are two separate species. ==Description== The adult queen angelfish overall body color can be described as blue to blue-green with yellow rims on its scales. Their pectoral and ventral fins are also yellow but their lips and the edges of their dorsal fins and anal fins are dark blue. Queen angelfish are also known to have blue markings around each gill cover. Juveniles have dark blue bodies with yellow lips, gills, and tail and vertical bars ranging in color from light blue to white. The colors of the juvenile fish help them to blend in with the reefs. The queen angelfish may live up to 15 years in the wild and reach up to 45 centimeters (17 inches) in length. Queen angelfish are about three and a half pounds. ==Diet== The queen angelfish feeds primarily on sponges, but also feeds on tunicates, jellyfish, and corals as well as plankton and algae. Juveniles serve as \\"cleaners\\" and feed on the parasites of larger fish at cleaning stations. Although in home aquariums, aquarists have been successful in providing the queen angelfish a diet of meaty and algae based foods. ==Distribution== Queen angelfish inhabit reefs and are common near Florida, especially the Florida Keys, and also the Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico. It is rarely seen in the Bermuda Triangle and ranges as far south as Brazil and as North as Long Island. ==Reproduction== The adults are found in pairs year round, perhaps suggesting a long-term monogamous bond. The pairs reproduce by rising up in the water, bringing their bellies close together, and release clouds of sperm and eggs. The female can release anywhere from 25 to 75 thousand eggs each evening and as many as ten million eggs during each spawning cycle. The eggs are transparent, buoyant, and pelagic, floating in the water column. They hatch after 15 to 20 hours into larvae that lack effective eyes, fins, or even a gut. The large yolk sac is absorbed after 48 hours, during which time the larvae develop normal characteristics of free swimming fish. Larvae are found in the water column and feed on plankton. The larvae grow rapidly and about 3–4 weeks after hatching the long juvenile settles on the bottom. ==In aquaria== The queen angelfish is considered to be moderate in difficulty to keep in captivity and is ill-suited for the inexperienced aquarist. They are a moderately aggressive species that require a large aquarium. Most aquarists recommend a minimum tank size anywhere from 150 on up to 180 gallons. The queen angelfish may harass other fish, particularly similar sized angelfishes. It should be the last fish added to any system. It is not a reef safe fish, and larger specimens may nip at corals, particularly stony or soft ones, and ornamental invertebrates. ==Parasites== As other fish, the queen angelfish has a variety of parasites. One of them is the monogenean Microcotyle angelichthys, which is parasitic on its gills. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Humann, P. and N. Deloach.

Socolow, looking at Climate change mitigation scenarios. The project was funded by Ford Motor Company between 2000 and 2009 and has been receiving funding from BP since 2000. The goal of the approach is to demonstrate that global warming is a problem which can be attacked using today's commercially available technologies to reduce emissions. The objective is to stabilize concentrations under 500ppm for the next fifty years, using wedges from a variety of different strategies which fit into the stabilization triangle. A newer estimate by the original authors indicated that by 2011, the number of necessary wedges had increased from seven to nine. This was due to the continuing increase in emissions since the original 2004 paper which determined the number of wedges that would have been necessary, if serious action to mitigate climate change had begun then.Robert Socolow, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists website, 27 September 2011. ==Concept== Scenario Emissions of and other greenhouse gases have been increasing ever since the Industrial Revolution. If the trend continues to hold, emissions will double by 2055. To prevent the worst consequences of global warming, scientists recommend freezing and reducing net global emissions immediately. Stabilization triangle If global emissions of are graphed for the next 50 years, the difference between the business as usual scenario and the flat path forms a triangle. This triangle is known as the stabilization triangle. Pacala and Socolow divided this hypothetical triangle into seven stabilization wedges, which represent different measures that must be taken to reduce emissions. When speaking of different strategies to reduce emissions, the language \\"to reduce one wedge's worth,\\" is often employed, and by reducing the stabilization wedge of fourteen gigatons of into seven wedges, the task is much easier to conceptualize. Wedge strategies As Pacala and Socolow originally presented the wedges concept in Science, there are fifteen different wedge strategies. Regarding the specific number, Socolow says that he and Pacala didn't include all of the possibilities, but that \\"It was a matter of rhetoric to stop at 15. And exhaustion. There was nothing magic about 15.\\" On the CMI website, the same strategies are presented and expanded upon in detail, and are re-organized into nine categories (as of 2020): #Efficiency #Fuel switching #Carbon capture and storage #Forest and agricultural soils #Nuclear #Wind #Solar #Biomass fuels #Natural sinks ==Uses== An example of a self-made Wedge Game board used by the Houston Advanced Research Center. Because of the simplicity of the wedge game, it has become popular as a communication tool for global warming mitigation. It is used in a variety of arenas and by a variety of players including businessmen, politicians, teachers, and students. David Hawkins, climate director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, puts the ease of use of the Wedge Game this way: Education The Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI) permits anyone to use the game and make use of their materials, provided that they share the results with CMI. Because it is so widely accessible, it has become included in certain high school curricula. The Keystone Center has deemed the Stabilization Wedge Game to fulfill the following National Education Standards: S1, S6, LA4, LA5, C4, C5, E1, G1, G5, and WH9. The American Association for the Advancement of Science hosted a conference for educators at the Hilton in San Francisco 2007-02-18. Collaborating with AAAS were the National Science Teachers Association and the United Educators of San Francisco (representing the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers). Dr. Socolow and Dr. Hotinski personally presented the Stabilization Wedge concept at the event. Business The Stabilization Wedge Game is also used as a centerpiece for business seminars. Business executives played the game at as seminar held by the Sustainable Enterprise Academy at York University in Toronto. ==Criticism== The primary critique of the Wedge Game is that it is too simple, especially regarding the economic aspect of global warming mitigation. The materials provided by CMI only attach one, two, or three dollar signs to each wedge as a broad estimate of the expense of each option. James L. Connaughton, former chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality in the Bush Administration, is a critic of the Wedge Game for its oversimplicity, and he has even said that some of the numbers used by Socolow and Pacala, such as 550 ppm as a maximum allowable target for , lack a scientific basis. Richard G. Richels, a senior engineer at the Electric Power Research Institute, says that the lack of economic precision in the game could create misconceptions: Another criticism of the game is that one of the premises, i.e. that humanity already has the tools and technologies to halt climate change, is misleading. Marty Hoffert of the New York University Physics Department claims that while the technologies are available in a technical sense, they are not available in an operational sense, and it will take a massive mobilization to make progress. Hoffert explains: In a 2010 Science article, Hoffert also suggested that 18-25 wedges may be necessary to achieve the goal, given the higher rates of emission growth that have occurred since the original study, even if no new sources were added beginning in 2010. In June 2008, Joseph Romm argued in Nature magazine that \\"If we are to have confidence in our ability to stabilize carbon dioxide levels below 450 p.p.m. emissions must average less than 5 GtC per year over the century. This means accelerating the deployment of the... wedges so they begin to take effect in 2015 and are completely operational in much less time than originally modelled by Socolow and Pacala.\\" A final criticism is that the Wedge Game focuses on technological fixes rather than fundamentally challenging the endless growth economy that is at the heart of global climate change. The 2007 IPCC reports state clearly that economic and demographic growth are the fundamental drivers of global climate change. Yet of the fifteen wedges developed by Pacala and Socolow, only one—halving the number of miles driven by the world's automobile fleet—might be considered a \\"demand reduction\\" wedge. None of their wedges treat population reduction. ==References== Category:Environmental education video games ","title":"Climate stabilization wedge"},{"id":"12354360","text":"Dypsis confusa is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

It was built in 1928 as the Wilson Theatre, designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. ==History== John Francis Dodge and his brother Horace were original investors in Ford Motor Company who sold their interest to Henry Ford and established their own company, the Dodge Motor Company, in 1914. Both brothers died in 1920, leaving their respective widows very wealthy women. Matilda Dodge Wilson, John's widow, married in 1925 to Alfred Wilson, was interested in stage productions and decided to use part of her fortune to build a venue in Detroit to serve as home to a repertory troupe, and to host touring Broadway performers. She hired the prominent Detroit architectural firm of Smith, Hinchman & Grylls who assigned William Kapp to design the building and spent $1.5 million on the construction. At the time of its opening in 1928, the building was dubbed the Wilson Theatre. ==Building== Kapp designed the six-story Wilson Theater in an Art Deco style. The Madison Street facade is decorated with orange and tan brick with Pewabic tile and stone accents. The upper facade is divided into seven bays by stone-covered piers which are capped with terra cotta theatrical masks. In each of the five central bays are two windows separated by a narrower pier. The end bays have only one window. The parapet boasts coral and green Pewabic tile in a quatrefoil pattern and the facade at street level has been covered with travertine with green marble at the base. The original interior was designed in a Spanish Renaissance style and seated 1,800. The lower level lounge featured a built-in bar among its amenities. ==Later history== During the Great Depression, the cash-strapped Detroit Symphony Orchestra was unable to maintain its own building, Orchestra Hall, and played in a number of other locations in the city. In 1946, the orchestra moved into Wilson Theatre, renaming it Detroit Music Hall. The symphony left for the newly constructed Ford Auditorium in 1956, and the building was used for other purposes, especially a movie theater showing Cinerama films. In 1971, Music Hall became home of the fledgling Michigan Opera Theatre. The opera company staged most of its productions here through the 1984 season. Restoration efforts began in 1973 and continued for several years. In 1974, the venue was renamed the Music Hall Center for Performing Arts. It is currently the only venue in Detroit built expressly to present live performances. The theater was added to the Michigan Register of Historic Places in 1976 and National Register of Historic Places in 1977. A State of Michigan historical marker was placed at the entrance in 1978. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Music Hall website Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1928 Category:Theatres in Detroit Category:Performing arts centers in Michigan Category:Concert halls in Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:Event venues established in 1928 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts"},{"id":"12354413","text":"Dypsis ifanadianae is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

But her sister Zeenat approaches her and asks her to become the second wife of her husband Aamir, Zaara's brother-in-law, the reason being Aamir's family's insistence on getting him married a second time due to Zeenat's inability to conceive and give the family an heir. Zeenat wishes only Zaara to become Aamir's second wife for she feels any other girl will take her place in Aamir's life and separate the two of them. Zaara spurns Samar and marries Aamir for her sister's happiness. After some time Zaara and Aamir fall in love with each other, and both Zeenat and Zaara conceive. However Zeenat's innate insecurity causes her to turn green at the very sight of Zaara and Aamir together. Unable to stand sharing her husband with her sister, Zeenat plots and successfully creates a rift between Zaara and Aamir. She also convinces Aamir that Khushi, Zaara's daughter, is not even his child but someone else's, the fruit of Zaara's unfaithfulness to him. Aamir divorces Zaara and she is thrown out of the house. She then realizes that it was Zeenat who all along created problems for her and ultimately separated her and Aamir, aided and abetted by none other than her first love Samar, who instead of accepting the change in situations gracefully, turned into a jealous and vengeful lover. Zaara then changes from a simple and straightforward girl to a mature and intelligent woman bent on getting justice for herself and her innocent young daughter. How she manages to outwit and punish Zeenat and Samar form the rest of the story. The court thinks Zaara killed Aamir, and she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Then, 10 years later, Khushi grew up and Zaara was released from jail, and went back home. Many family members that lived in that house were suddenly disappeared (this could have been what the producers of the drama wanted to). Zeenat manages to bring Zaara near some cliff and shoots her, Zaara falls down the cliff, it was believed that Zaara was dead, but she was not. Zaara soul enters another girl's body. She learns her kids are in danger so she re-enters her home in order to get to save her kids and find the reason behind her death. She soon makes friends with everyone in the house. With the help of Sagar (Khushi's teacher), Zaara makes up a plan to get Zeenat's identity revealed. Zeenat tries to kill Sagar and gets caught by the entire family. Zaara asks Zeenat why she brought her in the house as Aamir's second wife. Everyone realizes that the women is actually Zaara. Gul, Zeenat's partner in crime, confesses in front of everyone that Zeenat was jealous of Zaara so she gave Zaara a hard time, killed Aamir, and tried to kill Zaara several times. The family also finds out that Zaara gave up her son, Aman, for Zeenat's happiness (Zeenat wanted to give birth to a son) and took in Khushi as her own. Aman goes to Zaara and asks his mother for forgiveness. Zaara hugs Aman and Khushi. Zeenat is taken away by the cops. Gul asks for forgiveness and Zaara forgives her as Gul has repented for her mistakes, Gul turned to a good person. Sagar also proposes to Khushi to marry. The show ends by showing the family as being united and happy. == Characters == Zaara Zaara is a 21-year-old girl belonging to an upper middle-class Muslim family.

It is endemic to Madagascar as is reflected in the species name (onilahensis) referring to the Onilahy River, south of Toliara. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== Dypsis onilahensis is a pinnate leaved, clustering palm typically growing in clusters of 3 - 10 trees with adult trees in ideal conditions growing to 10 – 20 m high in height with stems of around 15 cm in diameter. Stems are typically grey at the base and dark green towards the crown with ringed bands and surrounding the circumference of the stem. Leaves grow up to 2 m in length with up to 70 pinnae (leaflets) of 30 cm or more and arch pendulously downwards giving the palm a graceful weeping appearance. ==Habitat== Dypsis onilahensis is native to North West and West Madagascar as well as South-Central Madagascar. In the northern part of its range it may be found growing in riverine forest at between 50 – 300 m altitude and between 750m - 2400 m in riverine or evergreen forest remnants in the central mountains and southern parts of its range. ==Conservation== It is classed as vulnerable in the wild. Although its potential native range is large the habitat is prone to destruction by fire. Numbers are estimated at less than a thousand. A population in the Isalo National Park is well-protected, but numbers less than a few hundred individuals. Outside of Madagascar D. onilahensis is fairly common in cultivation in sub-tropical and warm temperate climates including South Africa, California, southern Florida and Australia. ==References== * Dransfield, J. & Beentje, H. 1995.

Over time, they were known for serving the Hosokawa clan, then the Miyoshi clan and then the Ichijo clan.Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d’histoire et de géographie du Japon; Papinot, (2003). \\"Chōsokabe,\\" Nobiliare du Japon, p. 4 [PDF 8 of 80]; retrieved 2013-5-4. ==History== 600px A family tree of Chōsokabe clan. The clan claims descent from Qin Shi Huang (d. 210 BCE), the first emperor of a unified China. The clan is associated with Tosa Province in modern-day Kōchi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Chōsokabe Motochika, who unified Shikoku, was the twenty-first daimyō (or head) of the clan. In their early history of the Sengoku period, Chōsokabe Kunichika's father Kanetsugu, was killed by the Motoyama clan in 1508. Therefore, Kunichika was raised by the aristocrat Ichijō Husaie of the Ichijō clan in Tosa Province. Later, towards the end of his life, Kunichika took revenge on the Motoyama clan and destroyed them with the help of the Ichijō in 1560. Kunichika would go on to have children, including his heir and the future Daimyo of the Chōsokabe, Motochika, who would go on to unify Shikoku. First, the Ichijō family was overthrown by Motochika in 1574. Later, he gained control of the rest of Tosa due to his victories at the Battle of Watarigawa in 1575. He then also destroyed the Kono and the Soga clan. Over the ensuing decade, he extended his power to all of Shikoku in 1583. However, in 1585, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Oda Nobunaga's successor) invaded that island with a force of 100,000 men, led by Ukita Hideie, Kobayakawa Takakage, Kikkawa Motonaga, Toyotomi Hidenaga, and Toyotomi Hidetsugu. Motochika surrendered, and forfeited Awa, Sanuki, and Iyo Provinces; Hideyoshi permitted him to retain Tosa. Under Hideyoshi, Motochika and his son Chōsokabe Nobuchika participated in the invasion of neighboring Kyūshū, in which Nobuchika died. In 1590, Motochika led a naval fleet in the Siege of Odawara, and also fought in the Japanese invasions of Korea along with Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1592. After Motochika died in 1599 at age 61, the next clan leader was his son Chōsokabe Morichika. He led the clan forces in support of the Toyotomi at the Battle of Sekigahara. After 1600, the Chōsokabe were removed as daimyo of Tosa. After the Siege of Osaka in 1615, Morichika was executed and the clan was ended as a political and military force. Among the retainers to the clan were Kōsokabe Chikayasu, Tani Tadasumi, Hisatake Chikanao, Yoshida Takayori, Yoshida Shigetoshi, Yoshida Masashige. Shirō Sōkabe, the 19th century missionary, was a descendant of the Chōsokabe clan. ==Clan Heads== # Chōsokabe Yoshitoshi (長宗我部能俊, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Toshimune (長宗我部俊宗, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Tadatoshi (長宗我部忠俊, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Shigeuji (長宗我部重氏, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Ujiyuki (長宗我部氏幸, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Kiyoyuki (長宗我部満幸, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Kanemitsu (長宗我部兼光, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Shigetoshi (長宗我部重俊, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Shigetaka (長宗我部重高, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Shigemune (長宗我部重宗, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Nobuyoshi (長宗我部信能, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Kaneyoshi (長宗我部兼能, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Kanetsuna (長宗我部兼綱, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Yoshishige (長宗我部能重, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Motochika (長宗我部元親, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Fumikane (長宗我部文兼, ? – ? ) # Chōsokabe Motokado (長宗我部元門, ? –1471) # Chōsokabe Katsuchika (長宗我部雄親, ? –1478) # Chōsokabe Kanetsugu (長宗我部兼序, ? –1518) # Chōsokabe Kunichika (長宗我部国親, 1504–1560) # Chōsokabe Motochika (長宗我部元親, 1539–1599) # Chōsokabe Morichika (長宗我部盛親, 1575–1615) # Chōsokabe Moritsune (長宗我部盛恒, ? –1615) ==Popular culture== The Chōsokabe clan and Chōsokabe Motochika in particular are featured in many franchises set in the Sengoku period such as Sengoku Basara, Samurai Warriors, Nioh 2, Nobunaga's Ambition and Total War: Shogun 2.

American Sports Cavalcade was a winner of the cable television ACE Award for their motorsports coverage. ==Format== The first contracted season of the show produced 26 installments (episodes). At the opening of each episode, a narrator would say, \\"Diamond P Sports presents... the American Sports Cavalcade. A panorama of speed, color, drama, and excitement!\\" Over the years, American Sports Cavalcade televised such sports as NASCAR and ASA stock car racing, NHRA drag racing, CART Indycar racing, IMSA and SCCA sports car racing, AMA supercross and superbike racing, USAC and World of Outlaws sprint car racing, monster truck racing and truck and tractor pulling from TNT Motorsports, APBA offshore power boat racing, Swamp Buggy racing from Naples, Florida, and even a couple of rodeo events during their first few seasons. This show usually aired during racing season on Saturdays and once or twice on Sundays, with the same episode airing each time during that weekend. The episodes were almost always taped, edited, and broadcast a week or two after the event had taken place (known in broadcasting as tape delay). The episodes were usually 90 minutes in length. In the mid-'80s, Diamond P and TNN were the first group to televise racing from Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. ==Personnel== The show was originally hosted by singer-songwriter and actor Ed Bruce, along with expert commentary by Steve Evans and Brock Yates. Executive producer Harvey M. Palash and producer/director John B. Mullin oversaw the show. Bruce was himself a high school football and baseball player and for a time held a Sports Car Club of America competition racing license. Bruce eventually left Cavalcade to host a different TNN program called Truckin' USA. Throughout the years, Cavalcade would employ other announcers as well, including Paul Page, Gary Gerould, Ralph Sheheen, and \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits for NHRA telecasts. Production company Diamond P Sports and Opryland Productions (parent entity of TNN) had cooperated on numerous programs since 1975. ==Highlight VHS== In 1989, Diamond P Sports and TNN collaborated and released a video entitled And They Walked Away. This VHS video featured a compilation of footage from the first six years of American Sports Cavalcade, and it featured a plethora of auto racing and motor sports accidents, crashes, and fires in which the driver(s) beat the odds to survive the incident. Fatal accidents, as the title alludes to, were not included in this production. ==References== Category:1983 American television series debuts Category:1995 American television series endings Category:1990s American television series Category:The Nashville Network original programming Category:Motorsport in the United States Category:American sports television series Category:NASCAR on television ","title":"American Sports Cavalcade"},{"id":"12354590","text":"Hedyscepe canterburyana, the big mountain palm or umbrella palm, is the sole species in the genus Hedyscepe of the family Arecaceae. It is endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia and is threatened by habitat loss. It is a solitary palm with a distinct crownshaft, and bears unisexual flowers of both sexes. With the Rhopalostylis palms of Norfolk Island and New Zealand it forms the botanic subtribe Rhopalostylidinae. If differs from Rhopalostylis in minor floral details including having more than six stamens, and in being protandrous rather than protogynous. The two genera were formerly included in Archontophoenicinae until a recent revision (Dransfield, Uhl et al., 2005). In some (but not all) molecular phylogenetic analyses, Hedyscepe was found to be nested in the New Caledonia endemic Basselinia.Baker, W. J., M. V. Norup, J. J. Clarkson, T. L. P. Couvreur, J. L. Dowe, C. E. Lewis, J. C. Pintaud, V. Savolainen, T. Wilmot, and M. W. Chase. (2011). Phylogenetic Relationships among Arecoid Palms (Arecaceae: Arecoideae). Annals of Botany 108 (8): 1417–32. ==Description== Hedyscepe canterburyana is a slow-growing palm up to tall which grows on mountain forests, cliffs, and exposed ridges overlooking the sea, at about of altitude. It has a slender, close-ringed trunk, a prominent silvery crownshaft and a compact crown of dense, dark green, stiffly arching recurved fronds somewhat reminiscent of those of Howea belmoreana. The egg-shaped fruit are deep red when ripe, and about 4 cm long. They appear in densely bunched fruiting spikes from below the crownshaft. Each fruit contains a single seed. ==Cultivation== Fruits of Hedyscepe canterburyanaLord Howe Island has a subtropical climate. Summers are mild to warm with regular rain, and winters are wetter and somewhat cooler. Average maximum temperatures range between in winter and in the summer. In winter, average minimum temperatures range between , and in summer. Humidity averages in the 60 to 70 per cent range all year round.Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, Climate of Lord Howe Island . Accessed 24 July 2008. With its arching fronds, H. canterburyana is a very attractive palm which is becoming increasingly popular among garden enthusiasts in cool subtropical and warm temperate climates. It is difficult to grow in the tropics or where nights are never cool, but does well in climates like Sydney and Auckland, and can tolerate the occasional light frost once established. It needs a rich organic soil, and shelter from sun for at least the first five years. It also does well in containers or as indoor plants where light is good. Single plants are capable of producing fertile seed. Fresh seed is slow and erratic in germination, with seedlings appearing from five to 18 months after they are sown. Fruit take up to four years to ripen and it is not easy to tell when the seeds are ripe. ==Sources== *Dransfield, John, Natalie W Uhl, Conny B Asmussen, William J Baker, Madeline M Harley, and Carl E Lewis 2005.

It is native to Round Island, Mauritius. ==Description== The Bottle Palm's stem swells from near its base Bottle palm has a large swollen (sometimes bizarrely so) trunk. It is a myth that the trunk is a means by which the palm stores water. Bottle palms have only four to six leaves open at any time. The leaves of young palms have a red or orange tint, but a deep green is assumed at maturity. The flowers of the palm arise from under the crownshaft. This species is often confused with its relative, the Spindle Palm, which also has a swollen trunk. However the Spindle palm's trunk swells in the middle (resembling the shape of a spindle), whereas the trunk of the Bottle palm swells from near the base and tapers further up. Its inflorescence branches in 4 orders, and its 2.5 cm fruits can be orange or black. The trunk of both species becomes more and more slender as the palm ages. Within Mauritius, the only other extant Hyophorbe species is the common Hyophorbe vaughanii. The Bottle palm can be distinguished from this species however, by its swollen trunk when young; by its much smaller (2.5 cm) orange or black fruits; and by its inflorescence, which branches in four orders rather than three.C.Lewis, Barboza, N. (2000). ldentity of the Hyophorbe Palms at the Botanical Garden of Cienfuegos, Cuba Palms 44. p.95. ==Distribution and habitat== The bottle palm is naturally endemic to Round Island, off the coast of Mauritius. While habitat destruction may destroy the last remaining palms in the wild, the survival of the species is assured due to its ubiquitous planting throughout the tropics and subtropics as a specimen plant. It is one of three Hyophorbe species which naturally occur in Mauritius, and one of only two that are still extant. ==Cultivation== Bottle palms are very cold sensitive and are killed at 0 °C (32 °F) or colder for any appreciable length of time. They may survive a brief, light frost, but will have foliage damage. Only southern Florida and Hawaii provide safe locations in the USA to grow Bottle Palm, although mature flowering specimens may be occasionally be seen in favored microclimates around Cape Canaveral and Tampa- St. Petersburg-Clearwater in coastal central Florida. It makes a fine container-grown palm in other locations as long as it is protected from the cold and not overwatered. Image:Hyophorbe lagenicaulis.jpgSeedling stage.

In 1962, the Mission Houses, together with Kawaiahao Church, both built by those early missionaries, were designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL) under the combined name Kawaiahao Church and Mission Houses. In 1966 all the NHLs were included in the National Register of Historic Places. The Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site and Archives collects, preserves, interprets, and exhibits documents, artifacts, and other records of Hawaii's \\"missionary\\" period from about 1820 to 1863. It interprets its historic site and collections and makes these collections available for research, educational purposes, and public enjoyment. The archive's collection holds over 3,000 Hawaiian, Western, and Pacific artifacts, and more than 12,000 books, manuscripts, original letters, diaries, journals, illustrations and Hawaiian church records. The historic site and archive is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The general admission charge is $12, with discounts for students, seniors, and the military. ==Houses== The evolution of Mission House architecture illustrates the progressive adaptation of missionaries from New England to the climate, culture, and building materials they encountered in the Sandwich Islands. Oldest Frame House The materials to build the Oldest Frame House (Ka Hale Lāau 'the wood house') arrived by ship around Cape Horn from Boston in 1821. They had already been measured and cut, ready to assemble into a frame house suitable for the climate of New England: with small windows to help keep the heat inside and short eaves so as not to risk cracking under a load of snow. Though principally occupied by the seven members of Daniel Chamberlain's family, it often housed as many as five other missionary families, along with occasional ailing sailors or orphans. The small parlor served as a schoolhouse, and the basement served as the dining hall. The cookhouse was a separate building.Sandler, Mehta, and Haines 2008, p. 11 Chamberlain House The Chamberlain House (Ka Hale Kamalani) was built in 1831 from materials procured locally: coral blocks cut from reefs offshore and lumber salvaged from ships. Designed by the mission's quartermaster, Levi Chamberlain, to hold supplies as well as people, it had two stories, an attic, and a cellar. The windows are larger, more numerous, and shuttered against the sun.Sandler, Mehta, and Haines 2008, p. 12 The building now serves as the main exhibition hall for the Museum. Print House In 1841, a covered porch and balcony were added to the frame house, and an extra bedroom was built next door out of coral blocks. Both additions show further adaptation to an indoor-outdoor lifestyle appropriate to the climate.Sandler, Mehta, and Haines 2008, p. 12 The extra coral building later became the mission's Print House (Ka Hale Pai) and now serves as a museum exhibit to show how the missionaries and native Hawaiians worked together to produce the first materials printed in the Hawaiian language. ==Gallery== Image:Honolulu-Mission-Houses-Bingham.JPGThe Oldest Frame House (Ka Hale Lāau 'the wood house'), 1821 Image:Honolulu-Mission- Houses-Chamberlain.JPGThe Chamberlain House (Ka Hale Kamalani), 1831 Image:Honolulu-Mission-Houses-Press.JPGThe Print House (Ka Hale Pai), 1841 ==References== * Sandler, Rob, Julie Mehta, and Frank S.

Spindle palms are fairly cold intolerant. They are defoliated at 32 °F (0 °C) and may be killed at anything below that. If the palm does survive a freeze, the next few emerging leaves are stunted. Spindle palms grow in the US in south Florida and in isolated favored microclimates along the coastlines of the Tampa-St.Petersburg-Clearwater areas as well as the Cape Canaveral and Satellite Beach areas of central Florida.

Four Soviet Navy officers and 40 enlisted men reported aboard on 1 May 1945, and two more officers and 32 enlisted men came aboard on 6 May 1945. Soviet Navy, 1945-1960 Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Peril was decommissioned on 22 May 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-281 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she entered service with the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet on 27 June 1945. After the Soviet Union entered the war on 8 August 1945, T-281 participated in the Soviet offensive against Japanese forces in Northeast Asia, including the Soviet amphibious landing at Rajin- Sŏnbong, Korea, on 12 August 1945. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Peril to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-272 on 7 February 1955. ==Disposal== TY-281 was scrapped in 1960.

While originally planned for syndication, the format became the original lineup of MyNetworkTV in 2006. Six limited-run serials were produced, each running about 65 episodes, and at least three others were halted in development. New episodes aired from Monday to Friday – and weekend clip shows recapped the shows' storylines. Producers planned continuous cycles of thirteen-week serials with no repeats. Once one series ended, another unrelated melodrama would begin the following week. In total, MyNetworkTV planned to air 600 hours of original dramatic programming in HDTV every year. The telenovela format was unsuccessful and ratings were unexpectedly low. An average of about 781,000 people tuned in to watch the telenovelas, according to Nielsen Media Research.MyNetworkTV will try Plan B Deseret News (Salt Lake City), March 27, 2007 by Scott D.

The novelas premiered on September 5, 2006 and last aired on July 18, 2007. ==Production== Development Syndication plans Paul Buccieri, Twentieth Television's programming chief, became fascinated by telenovelas in the 1990s, inspired by his Latina mother-in-law's devotion to such shows.Plot Twists for Genre - 10/16/2006 - Multichannel News He said that the nightly soap concept would work in the U.S. if given sufficient time. Along with colleagues Stephen Brown and Jack Abernathy, he started discussing the telenovela format in 2005. Before it announced MyNetworkTV, Fox offered the telenovelas in syndication under as an anthology titled Desire, which would air one hour each weeknight starting in the fall of 2006. It originally planned to air three serials per season. They were originally intended to air as late night time programming. In December 2005, Bucceri said the company had already bought enough novela formats to air original shows for five years. Fox then added a second hour and planned to use two umbrella titles: Desire and Secret Obsessions.MNT: All Novelas, All the Time - 7/21/2006 7:01:00 AM - Broadcasting & Cable After receiving lukewarm response from stations not owned by Fox, Twentieth Television decided to pitch the show for June 2006. It argued that teenagers are out of school and planted in front of their TV sets, while reruns dominate network schedules. The telenovelas were also briefly considered for placement on The CW. MyNetworkTV Fox Television Stations chairman Roger Ailes greenlit the format as a contingency plan for Fox-owned UPN stations. Then MyNetworkTV was introduced to advertisers on February 22, 2006, as a reaction to the demise of UPN and The WB. The telenovelas became the new network's weeknight lineup, along with clip shows on Saturdays. MyNetworkTV targeted the telenovelas at the \\"Adults 18-49\\" demographic, which is a general audience. While the novelas had a few takers for a planned summer syndication run, Twentieth made those stations surrender the shows, thanks to a contract clause that let Fox take away the show if it is carried by a network. As MyNetworkTV's debut grew closer, Fox dropped the idea of using two umbrella titles for its telenovelas. Desire became the title of the first series aired. The two umbrella titles reappeared in 2007, showing up during opening credits and on the network's Web site. Budgets Jack Abernethy, chief executive of Fox Television Stations, said before launch that MyNetworkTV's six-day-per-week format was the wave of the future because a traditional schedule costs too much. Each episode was said to cost about one- tenth the budget of traditional prime-time shows, and even less than the typical daytime soap. Another estimate said the serials cost $200,000 to $500,000, compared to the $2 million to $3 million cost of a mainstream primetime drama. Unfortunately, ad revenue was not sufficient for the format to succeed. At the 2006 upfront season, MyNetworkTV secured less than $50 million in ad deals, compared to $640 million for the new CW network. National advertising spots sold for between $20,000 and $35,000 for a 30-second spot as of September 2006. Writers’ dispute At first, MyNetworkTV called its soap writers \\"translators\\" since the projects were adaptations of existing Spanish telenovelas. These people were also non-union, which soon led to a labor dispute.MyNetworkTV Nears WGA Deal; Telenovela 'Translators' to Gain Writer Status.(TV Currents)(Writers Guild of America) Industry & Business Article - Research, News, Information, Contacts, Divisions, Subsidiaries, Business Associations The eventual settlement with the Writers Guild of America led to higher-than-expected programming costs.Murdoch’s Next Bet - 8/28/2006 - Broadcasting & Cable MyNetworkTV’s union deals doubled its programming costs to more than $1 million per week for each series. This significantly affected the telenovelas' bottom line. Before the dispute, News Corp. President-COO Peter Chernin said the format could \\"be profitable from day one.\\"My Network TV Mulls Change To Programming Strategy - 12/15/2006 2:13:00 PM - Broadcasting & Cable Filming The shows were shot at Stu Segall Studios in San Diego. The facility, built by a former porn producer, specializes in low-budget productions. Since Segall rented part of the lot to the U.S. government, the telenovelas were shot near a mock Iraqi village used to train military personnel.SignOnSanDiego.com > News > Features - Modest mogul As a cost-saving measure, producers tend to hire performers with limited acting experience. The same sets were reused in multiple shows. Producers built 53 shared living-room sets, which were repurposed by changing colors and camera angles to give them a different look.MyNetworkTV soaps race against time, low budgets Also, scripts were finished before taping started, so that all scenes on the same set were filmed at the same time, out of episode order. Up to three shows were filmed at once. The production model resembled that of movies more than normal US television series. Each complete series — equivalent to three seasons of conventional dramas — was filmed in about four months, as nine crews worked simultaneously,MyNetworkTV to offer series of 'telenovelas' : Entertainment : Evansville Courier Press For example, Desire used three directors, 50 cast members, 200 bit players, 2,000 extras and 2,800 script pages (compared to 120 pages for features and 45 for dramas). Two main groups worked on the novelas, one for the Desire brand and one for Secret Obsessions serials. The Desire shows, such as Watch Over Me, were more action- oriented to attract more male viewers. All of the telenovelas used the same narrators, actor Ray Van Ness III for the Secret Obsessions, and an uncredited female actor for the Desire brand. The telenovelas are broadcast in high definition where available – and in letterbox format on standard definition broadcasts. During the all-novela period, MyNetworkTV promoted itself as \\"the first all HDTV network.\\" In addition, early shows carried a SAP signal carrying a Spanish audio track, but an alternate closed captioning channel with Spanish translation was not used; in execution as most affiliates of the network never utilized SAP channels due to a lack of programming requiring it, and outside of major markets, the Spanish dub was never heard. Comparison with Spanish telenovelas MyNetworkTV’s telenovelas were much shorter than the originals: about 65 episodes, rather than 120 to 180 hours. Each show was scripted, filmed and completed as a whole. The network could not shorten or lengthen shows. In familiar telenovela form, shows often began with the tag “MyNetworkTV Presents.” Yet the beginnings of shows featured long flashbacks intended to refresh viewers. The first two rotations also added titles to each episode. The daily format also featured the “Story” episode. These were clip shows that outlined the development of a major character. They were used in lieu of reruns. In addition, MyNetworkTV's shows featured white, black and Hispanic actors in prominent roles and often showed interracial couples, along with gay subplots. These English novelas also toned down the high pitched emotionalism of conventional telenovelas. The producers said they needed to account for the cultural differences with Latin countries. So while these serials were said to add campiness, cat-fights and gay sensibility, they were also seen to lack the \\"cultural depth\\" and \\"raw passion\\" of the Spanish originals. Camilo Cano, the VP of Caracol Television International, which sold two telenovela formats to MyNetworkTV, said he was satisfied with the English versions. “The basic elements of the novela were respected,” he said, “which is what concerns us the most.” He said Caracol worked to ensure the adaptations were faithful to the original serials.World Screen - Home Broadcast rotations All times are Eastern and Pacific (subtract one hour for Central and Mountain time) { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" ! ! style=\\"width:15%; background:silver;\\"Telenovela ! style=\\"width:7%; background:silver;\\"Time ! style=\\"width:15%; background:silver;\\"Premiere Date ! style=\\"width:15%; background:silver;\\"Finale Date - ! style=\\"width:10%; background:silver;\\"Fall 2006  fff; text- align:center;\\"Desire  fff; text-align:center;\\"8:00 P.M.  fff; text-align:center;\\"September 5, 2006  fff; text-align:center;\\"December 5, 2006 - ! style=\\"width:10%; background:silver;\\"Fall 2006  fff; text-align:center;\\"Fashion House  fff; text- align:center;\\"9:00 P.M.  fff; text- align:center;\\"September 5, 2006  fff; text- align:center;\\"December 5, 2006 - ! style=\\"width:10%; background:silver;\\"Winter 2006  fff; text- align:center;\\"Wicked Wicked Games  fff; text- align:center;\\"8:00 P.M.  fff; text- align:center;\\"December 6, 2006  fff; text- align:center;\\"March 6, 2007 - ! style=\\"width:10%; background:silver;\\"Winter 2006  fff; text-align:center;\\"Watch Over Me  fff; text-align:center;\\"9:00 P.M.  fff; text-align:center;\\"December 6, 2006  fff; text-align:center;\\"March 6, 2007 - ! style=\\"width:10%; background:silver;\\"Spring 2007  fff; text-align:center;\\"American Heiress  fff; text- align:center;\\"Weekly  fff; text-align:center;\\"March 13, 2007  fff; text-align:center;\\"July 18, 2007 - ! style=\\"width:10%; background:silver;\\"Spring 2007  fff; text-align:center;\\"Saints & Sinners  fff; text- align:center;\\"Weekly  fff; text-align:center;\\"March 14, 2007  fff; text-align:center;\\"July 18, 2007 } Had the daily format continued, Friends with Benefits and Rules of Deception would have debuted on June 5, 2007.

CKXT-TV, an independent station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada showed Desire and Fashion House, airing them in the afternoon time slot traditionally held by daytime soap operas. However, the station elected not to air any of the other telenovelas after the first cycle. ==Reaction== Campy melodramas MyNetwork promoted its telenovelas as trashy melodramas, resembling prime time soap operas like Dallas and Dynasty. Paul Buccieri called them \\"guilty pleasures\\" and compared them to beach novels. While these shows attempted to adhere to the telenovela format and tone, the network's executives and producers developed their own campy interpretation of the genre. They added characters and situations that differed from the Latin American originals. As telenovelas are inherently implausible and cartoonish, both Hispanic and non- Hispanic audiences scorned the new adaptations.Plot Twists for Genre By Luis Clemens -- Multichannel News, October 16, 2006 Reviewers were resoundingly negative.

Roger Ailes brought up MyNetworkTV in a Financial Times interview. \\"You should have seen us at Fox News Channel one year into it,\\" he said. \\"I've had this job for a year and it takes a little time to get these things off the runway.\\" Also, an executive of another television network told TV Week magazine that the existence of MNTV was \\"a miracle\\" because it went from concept to reality in only six months' time.MyNetworkTV Executives Plot Schedule Changes , TV Week, December 15, 2006 Ratings MyNetworkTV's debut was far from successful. Desire scored a 1.1 household rating/2 share; Fashion House went up to 1.3/2. Fox had sold about half of its projections of $50 million in advance commercial sales.

Wicked Wicked Games premiered to a 0.8 rating/1 share overnight rating during its first three nights, while Watch Over Me pulled a 0.7 rating/1 share. Both shows dropped by a 0.1 rating during the Monday-Wednesday period of their second week. The network sought better debuts for the shows since they premiered in December, while the major networks usually air reruns and the viewer presumably would sample programming on other networks. MyNetworkTV's 200 affiliates struggled to promote the new format—and ratings dropped in some markets as much as 90 percent. Even Los Angeles was an under-performing market.

The character was portrayed by several child actors since Hope's introduction in 2002, most notably Rachel and Amanda Pace. In 2010, the role was rapidly aged and recast with actress Kim Matula, who made her first appearance in January 2010. Matula departed the serial as a series regular in December 2014, but she made guest appearances in 2015 and 2016. As of 2018, the role is portrayed by Annika Noelle. Introduced in 2002, Hope is the result of an affair between Brooke Logan and Deacon Sharpe, Brooke's ex-son-in-law. Upon Matula's casting, her main storylines revolved around relationships with former love interests Liam and Wyatt Spencer, and rivalry with Steffy Forrester, the latter of which mirrors the rivalry between their mothers, Brooke Logan and Taylor Hayes. Matula was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2014 for her portrayal of Hope. Noelle's portrayal later earned a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2020. == Casting == Kim Matula was cast in the rapidly aged role of Hope in 2010. Between the years of 2002 and 2009, the character was played by child actresses, and appeared as a young girl around 5 years old by 2007. On December 4, 2009, it was announced that Hope was to be dramatically aged and portrayed by Kim Matula. Matula signed on as a contract character. Matula began taping The Bold and the Beautiful on November 19, 2009 and made her first appearance on January 11, 2010. On November 5, 2014, it was announced that after five years with the series, Matula would be departing the series.

In November 2017, Soap Opera Digest announced that actress Annika Noelle had been cast in the role of Hope; she made her first appearance on January 8, 2018. == Characterization == The young adult character of Hope was first described as \\"A polar opposite of what her mother Brooke once was, Hope makes no secret of her more traditional and reserved views on sex and marriage\\". Matula has described Hope as \\"Unlucky in love\\". Speaking about the character's dramatic aging and her storyline, head writer Bradley Bell stated: \\"Aging the character of ‘Hope’ to a teenager allows us to bring the next generation of ‘Logans’ to the forefront, as well as play a broader range of the ‘Forrester’ vs. ‘Logan’ story. ‘Hope’s’ presence at Forrester Creations, as well as in ‘Brooke’ and ‘Ridge’s’ home, sparks an intense competition between ‘Hope’ and her step-sister ‘Steffy’ as well as creates new conflict between long-time rivals ‘Brooke’ and ‘Taylor’ as each woman is determined to protect her own daughter.\\" ==Storylines== Back story Hope was conceived during an affair between Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan). At the time, Deacon was married to Hope's half-sister, Bridget Forrester. Hope was born at the Big Bear Cabin and delivered by Stephanie. Deacon signed over his paternal rights in 2007 to Ridge Forrester when RJ and Hope were taken from Brooke when she was proven to be an unfit mother by Social Services, reported by Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) was also a father figure for Hope when he was married to Brooke. 2010–2014 After the character was dramatically aged (SORASed), Hope is almost raped by a photographer, Graham Derros. but she is saved by Nick and Aggie Jones. As high school graduation approaches, she meets Oliver Jones, a DJ who becomes her first serious boyfriend. Instantly, the assertive Steffy takes an interest in Oliver and tries to lure him away from Hope and engineers a series of events designed to humiliate Hope. At a Forrester fashion show she tampers with a sign by removing the letters 'p' and 'e' out of Hope's name to create a sign that reads \\"Ho Logan\\". Then, at Hope's graduation party (with a mask theme), Brooke has sex with Oliver, claiming she thought it's her husband Ridge behind the mask; this is revealed by a video which Steffy put together (however, it was later revealed the video was tampered by Justin Barber, who worked for Spencer Publications — who are against Forrester Creations). Despite unresolved feelings and never getting a chance with Oliver again, Hope forgives her mother. Hope meets Liam Cooper, who was soon to be revealed to be the son of Bill Spencer Jr., Hope & Liam forge a friendship but there is something more there which Oliver, her ex- boyfriend sees whenever they are together. Hope & Oliver had broken up after he had accidentally slept with her mother which hurt her greatly. Liam and Hope fall deeply in love. Their love grows despite Oliver trying to win back Hope by making her jealous, by being in a relationship with Amber Moore. Then their relationship faces hardship when Amber falls pregnant after supposedly raping Liam, and Liam is thought to be the father during the whole pregnancy. She manipulates the situation every chance she gets and causes problems for Liam and Hope. Hope finds it difficult to deal with Amber having Liam's child & decides she must move on but the baby is born and it is quite evident the baby is not Liam's, turns out to be Marcus' baby instead. Liam and Hope reunite and he proposes to her. However, she wanted to use this as a way to promote her fashion line, so their wedding was planned for months ahead. Hope tells Liam she wants to wait to consummate their relationship after marriage, of course Steffy manipulates Liam every chance she gets. She decided she wanted him even though he was with Hope and was jealous after he saved her from drowning because his father rejected her and went back to his wife Katie. As Hope focuses more on her work, Steffy again finds an opportunity to manipulate Liam and he kisses Steffy. After witnessing the kiss, Hope takes off her engagement ring and leaves it at Liam's house. Heartbroken, Liam takes the ring and proposes to Steffy, who accepts. Liam and Steffy travel to Aspen, where they are married. Then Thomas set his eyes on Hope which Steffy very much encouraged. They shared a kiss despite Hope's unresolved feelings for Liam. Thomas whisks her away to Mexico upon Steffy's encouragement so he could get her mind off of Liam. Both couples accidentally end up in Mexico. Thomas proposes to Hope upon Steffy's encouragement again and she briefly acknowledges that she might not be ready at the time, but she tells him no that she is in love with Liam.; she tells Thomas, 'I feel safe with you' unbeknownst to his and Steffy's manipulations and intentions. Liam and Steffy are staying at the same resort also, and once Liam finds out, he goes after Thomas and Hope on a ATV chase, chasing Hope. Then Steffy gets her own ATV & goes after Liam and is injured after falling off her ATV while trying to get to Liam. She ends up in the hospital and everyone flies down and Bill decides to manipulate the situation because he knows that Liam is still in love with Hope and is about to leave Steffy to be with the woman he loves. Bill wants to keep Steffy near and perpetuates a lie about Steffy's health. Of course Liam finds out about the lie eventually and leaves Steffy in the end. Katie had gotten suspicious and uncovered the truth. Bill even locks her in a tower to keep her from telling Liam and Hope about what Bill had done because he and Steffy had been trying to keep Liam and Hope apart. Liam, feeling gutted and betrayed by Bill and Steffy, immediately leaves to find Hope. He finds her on the rooftop where he proposed to her and tells her that he loves her and that he wants to be with her to give their relationship a true chance without manipulations. When they later confront Bill with what they know and what they want from him, Bill refuses to give in, reminding Liam that Steffy is his wife and that he doesn't support his attempt to reunite with Hope. Liam, however, does not take that as an answer, making up his mind that his marriage to Steffy is over. Despite her pleading that they can get through this rough patch, Liam ends his relationship with Steffy and chooses to be with Hope. After she leaves, Liam goes outside where Hope is and reveals his left hand, which has no wedding ring on it. Brooke, worried that Steffy may try to pull a scheme to keep Liam, arranges for a wedding for Hope and Liam in her home, convinced that her son Rick would seduce Steffy into signing the annulment papers. Steffy refuses, and demands a full, legal divorce. Fearing again that Steffy would somehow scheme Liam into staying with her, Brooke insists that Hope take her relationship with Liam to the next level. The night did not go as well as Hope had wished, and she ended up traumatized. Brooke showed up early the next morning to see how the night went and found Hope in tears. Her mother then suggests that Hope needs to start seeing a sex therapist to help her with her trauma and so she can be with Liam. All this accomplishes though is getting Hope hooked on anxiety pills and when she passes out at the Forrester pool, he starts to worry and then she and Liam go to Aspen for a ski trip which Steffy ends up there too, she accidentally runs into her on the slopes and she confesses to Liam that she is hooked on the pills she is taking. At first he questions their future and in the heat of the moment he ends up kissing Steffy because she is crying because she doesn't want an annulment and is sorry he has hurt her. Then he goes and finds Hope and makes up with her and then they decide that the wedding is back on. Once the divorce becomes final, Liam and Hope went to Italy at Brooke's insistence to remarry. Bill tries to shanghai the wedding by bringing in Deacon Sharpe, which causes Hope to be late to the wedding and Liam to think that she had once again walked out on him. He turned to Steffy for comfort and asked her to leave with him and marry him again. Hope went to Liam's hotel suite, however, and Steffy hid in the bathroom while Hope told Liam what happened. Steffy insisted that Liam go ahead and marry Hope, so the wedding went off without a hitch. Once back in the States, Hope saw a video of Steffy and Liam kissing and falling into bed together on Hope's wedding day and out of that hurt, refuses to sign papers making their marriage legal in the US, wanting another wedding. Liam agrees, and Hope plans another wedding at the Forrester home. On the day of their re-do wedding, however, Liam arrives drunk, on the back of Steffy's motorcycle with dyed hair and a tattoo after a night out with Steffy, which is exactly what she wanted to do, cause a rift in their relationship, she planned the whole scheme hoping for these results. Outraged by Liam's continued reliance on Steffy, Hope calls off the wedding and her relationship with Liam. Thomas and Hope then becomes friends. While Hope is apart from Liam, he turns again to Steffy for comfort and he thinks he's in love, deciding to give her a chance since things fell apart with Hope. Finding out that Liam and Hope had been lied to by Rick about what went on the night before their wedding, Hope once is hurt by manipulations and lies. Once again, to try to stop Steffy from being with Liam, Brooke sets up a commitment ceremony on Liam's property without his knowledge while Liam is telling Rick that he thinks his future with Hope is over and calls Steffy, but Brooke has the priest from Italy to tell Liam that he can marry him and Hope. Steffy, however, finds out that she was pregnant several days earlier and waited to tell Liam about it until after he made his choice on which woman he wanted to be with. But she finds out that he has chosen Hope is going to marry her so she runs over to Liam's house to find him and tell him she was pregnant. After finding out that Steffy was pregnant with his child, Liam decided that they needed to be together because he wants to raise his child full-time since he didn't have a dad growing up. Devastated, Hope found solace in Oliver, who finally somehow admitted he still had feelings for her, particularly by showing her the Chinese symbol for \\"hope\\" he got tattooed on his leg for her. Hope is touched, and she decides to give him a second chance since Liam was giving Steffy a second chance because of their child. On the professional front, Hope steps down as spokeswoman for her line, Hope for the Future, and approves Rick's decision to hire Maya. During Steffy's pregnancy, she ignores warnings of riding her motorcycle which results in an accident, causing her to lose the baby and become infertile. After Steffy learns of her infertility, she tells Hope she is leaving for good and that Liam is now Hope's, not telling Hope or Liam the real issue. She and Liam go to Bear Cabin together to talk. While on a walk, she sees a naked stranger taking a shower. She takes a photo of him, only for him to turn around and see her. She runs away and he chases her. She then falls and is knocked unconscious. The stranger then carries her to safety and when she wakes up he kisses her. The mysterious stranger turns out to be Wyatt Fuller. After doing some digging, she learns he is the son of Bill Spencer, Jr., therefore the half-brother of Liam. Wyatt and Hope get closer after Liam flies off to see Steffy, asking Steffy why she left the way she did. Steffy rejects him and Liam comes home and proposes to Hope, who accepts. Wyatt moves in with Liam, but when Liam catches him kissing Hope, he punches Wyatt, and after a fight between Bill and Wyatt, he moves out, but Hope later selects Quinn and Wyatt's jewelry business to accompany 'Hope for the Future'. When Liam finds out, he convinces Hope to try and break the contract. Hope asks Eric to do so but he doesn't agree, knowing that it is a personal reason for wanting to end the contract. So the contract stands, much to Liam's dismay, and Hope and Wyatt fly to Mexico to get the Hope Diamond for the line, which makes problems for Liam. Hope and Liam get engaged, but when Hope receives a goodbye video Liam made for Steffy, it creates tension between them. Liam, thinking it was Wyatt that sent the video, later finds out it was actually Quinn, and Liam quickly informs Hope. Confronting them both, Hope finds out that Quinn did send the video, but Wyatt had no idea of it until the Hope Diamond reveal. Hope forgives them both. She later ends her engagement to Liam when she is feeling insecure about Liam always falling for Steffy's manipulations. They soon reconcile, but Hope wants to wait before they get married. Aly Forrester, who has a crush on Liam, sends him a picture of Wyatt and Hope kissing at a photoshoot. Liam decides to confront Hope about her refusal to marry, demands that they do so and that she cut all professional and personal ties with Wyatt and Quinn Artisan Jewelers. Hope chooses Liam over Wyatt and Eric reluctantly agrees to break the contract. Wyatt tries desperately to change Hope's mind but she won't, confessing to her mother that she had never met Liam & fallen in love with him, then Wyatt might have had a chance. On the day of the wedding, Hope gets a note to go see Liam, but she finds him with Steffy at the cabin. Knowing that Steffy is back from Paris, and guessing she would be back to fight for Liam, Hope decides to rehire Quinn, and she and Wyatt go to Hawaii together. Liam follows soon after to explain to Hope that Steffy had informed him that she is now able to conceive again, and that it was Quinn who once again interfered with their relationship. He then asks her to marry him immediately. Hope declines and ends her relationship with him, finally choosing Wyatt over Liam. Their happiness is short-lived when it is revealed by Liam that Wyatt took the Hope diamond as a P.R stunt, before the real jewel thieves had intentions to steal it. It almost ends their relationship completely, but Hope decides to give Wyatt another chance, much to Liam's dismay. Hope then endures a pregnancy scare, and with Liam's persuasion about making the right decision for her life before getting pregnant or married, she dates both brothers, agreeing that she will choose who she wants to spend the rest of her life with at the end of it. Finally, Hope chooses Liam and they become engaged. Quinn becomes outraged when Hope ends things with Wyatt, and threatens both Liam and Hope's lives. When Quinn tries to kill Liam once and for all, Wyatt and Deacon Sharpe save him. Wyatt declares his support for Liam and Hope's relationship. Because of this, Liam and Hope decide to rehire Wyatt at Forrester Creations. Wyatt inherits the Hope for the Future Diamond after Ricardo Montemayor dies. He gifts it to Hope, which causes friction between Liam and Hope, and the two brothers. When Liam demands Hope give it back to Wyatt, Hope refuses, and publicly declares at a press conference that she is keeping the diamond. Wyatt and Rick decide to take Hope and the diamond on a promotion tour, starting with a photo shoot in Paris. Hope asks Liam to come with her, or meet her there to marry her. But Liam, still angry, does not know if he will go. Hope tells him to meet her at 3pm the next day after the photo shoot if he wants to continue their relationship. Wyatt begs Hope not to marry Liam, though she insists that she and Liam belong together. Liam misses his deadline with Hope, who then leaves with Wyatt on the Spencer jet. Wyatt takes her to Bill's yacht in Monte Carlo, where he insists that Liam wasted all of his chances with Hope, but that he will always be there for her. Wyatt proposes to Hope using the HFTF diamond, and Hope accepts and marries Wyatt. Out of the hurt she feels at that moment, Hope decides to marry Wyatt and give him a chance of making her happy although she still loves Liam but she feels like if he really wanted a life with her, all these obstacles would not keep getting in the way. However, about a month later, Hope gets an urgent call from Liam. She finds out that Quinn orchestrated her and Wyatt's marriage by pushing Ivy off the Seine causing Liam to miss his chance to be with Hope. After confronting Quinn for her role and Wyatt for defending his mother, though she also feel sympathy for him, she had already married Wyatt and felt she should honor her commitment and then she found out that she was pregnant with Wyatt's child. She explains that she doesn't want her child to grow up with multiple fathers and have a complicated relationship like she did. She ended things with Liam for good and told him that she wanted to give her marriage to Wyatt a chance now with the baby on the way. This is all changed when she suffers a miscarriage, because she didn't pay attention to where she was going.. She was relentless in meddling and being way over the top with what she wanted and not being sensitive to what Wyatt and Hope wanted in their life and the baby mostly. It got so out of hand that finally she had to get a restraining order on Quinn. Quinn had grown quite obsessive with the baby & Wyatt. Finally when Quinn was not invited to the baby shower, she went ballistic and tells Liam that she will always love him. Hope visits Brooke in Milan, Italy, and does not return to L.A. with Brooke to get over the loss of her child. In 2015, Brooke attempts to stop Deacon's wedding to Quinn by getting Hope to talk to him via a video message on her tablet. Hope tells Deacon that Quinn is evil, but he marries her anyway. In early 2016, Liam is kidnapped by Quinn, and Steffy calls Hope, thinking that she may have information on Liam's whereabouts. She tells Steffy that she hasn't heard from Liam.  2018–present  Hope returns to Los Angeles in January 2018, at Ridge's request, to surprise her mother. She makes her intentions known of returning to Forrester and potentially relaunching the Hope for the Future line. When Hope meets Sally Spectra, she finds out that Liam and Steffy's marriage is in trouble and so she visits Liam to offer her support and friendship. Hope learns of Steffy and Bill sleeping together and confronts Steffy. However, Hope supports Steffy and Liam, and she tries to fix their marriage. Hope later starts to fall in love with Liam again, and wants Liam to leave Steffy because of her ruining their relationship in the past and her betrayal with Bill. Bill manipulates Liam to believe that Bill and Steffy are involved; Liam leaves Steffy and their daughter, Kelly, and proposes to Hope. The two almost marry, until Wyatt reveals that Bill set up the whole thing. Liam decides to give Steffy another chance for the sake of Kelly, but Hope soon discovers she's pregnant, from the one night she and Liam spent together before their aborted wedding. Steffy catches Liam and Hope making out behind the scenes of the Hope for the Future fashion show and she breaks up with him; Steffy steps back and gives Liam to Hope because she can no longer be involved in a triangle for Liam's heart and she needs to do what is best for Kelly. In August 2018, Hope and Liam wed in front of their friends, families, Steffy, and Taylor and were finally together like they had always wanted to be. They blissfully awaited the birth of their daughter & basked in the happiness they had always longed for.

Liam tells her that they still got a lot of time with Beth, and to only worry about the present. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hope Logan profile - Soapcentral.com Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Hope Logan"},{"id":"12354719","text":"Latania, commonly known as latan palm or latania palm, is a genus of flowering plant in the palm tree family, native to the Mascarene Islands in the western Indian Ocean.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesGovaerts, R. & Dransfield, J.

Male flowers are small, in clusters, and emerge from within leathery bracts on the catkin- like inflorescences. Female flowers are larger, solitary and not concealed within bracts. The fruits contain 1-3 pyrenes, which are seeds enclosed within woody endocarps. The endocarps have sculpted surfaces and the three species are readily distinguished from their pyrenes.

This palm was common on Réunion at one time, but the area in which it grows has diminished as land has been cleared for agriculture and for other purposes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being an endangered species in the wild, however it is also grown as an ornamental plant in various parts of the world. ==Gallery== File:Latanialontaroides.JPGForm File:Latania lontaroides young foliage (detail).JPGLeaf File:Lantania lontariodes.jpgOne of the few remaining in the wild in La Possession (male) File:/Users/rubenpena/Desktop/IMG_0533.jpeg ==References== lontaroides Category:Endemic flora of Réunion Category:Palms of Réunion Category:Endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Latania lontaroides"},{"id":"12354724","text":"Sonnet 79 is one of 154 sonnets published by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare in 1609. It is part of the Fair Youth sequence, and the second sonnet of the Rival Poet sequence. ==Exegesis== This sonnet continues the discussion of the previous sonnet, Sonnet 78, regarding other poets who also write poems dedicated to the fair youth. Sonnet 79 argues that the other poet deserves no thanks, because the quality of his writing derives from the quality of his subject. The poet (line 2) claims that earlier he had exclusively had the young man's patronage, or that his verse had exclusively been devoted to the young man's virtue or honor. But now those of his verses that benefited from the young man's grace (\\"gracious numbers\\"), are \\"decayed\\" because the youth's favors are being spread out and because the muse is not healthy (\\"sick muse\\"), which is a strange description considering the first line of Sonnet 78: \\"So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse\\". The muse (line 4) makes room for another poet, or another muse. When the speaker desperately and unexpectedly refers (line 7) to the rival poet as \\"thy poet\\", it is clear that loyalties have shifted. The sestet turns the rival poet's effort to find appropriate metaphors into a materialistic endeavor (\\"He robs thee … he lends … he stole …\\") regarding merely skin-deep attractiveness (\\"found it in thy cheek”). The poet suggests a poem by a rival that has little to add, but proclaims the youth is as virtuous as his virtue, his cheek is as lovely as his cheek, and requires no “thanks\\".Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 268 .Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 99-100. ==Structure== Sonnet 79 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 2nd line: × / × / × / × / × / My verse alone had all thy gentle grace; (79.2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The 4th line may be scanned with a rightward movement of the first ictus (the resulting four-position figure, \`× × / /\`, is sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): × × / / × / × / × / And my sick Muse doth give another place. (79.4) The meter calls for a 2-syllable pronunciation of \\"worthier\\" in the 6th line. ==NotesReferences== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 79"},{"id":"12354729","text":"Latania verschaffeltii, the yellow latan palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

Her mother was a trained classical pianist, but was unable to pursue her interest professionally. After gaining a degree in Psychology and Philosophy from University College, London, Wallace worked as a trainee producer for ITV's The Frost Programme with David Frost (1966–68). She went on to become a religious programmes producer and a current affairs reporter for London Weekend Television (1969–72). While an investigative journalist and social services correspondent for The Sunday Times (1972–89), she wrote a series of articles in 1972 highlighting the financial and emotional plight of the Thalidomide children who had been born in the 1950s and 1960s with physical disabilities. As a result of this campaign, she met Terry Wiles, about whom she co-authored a biography, On Giant's Shoulders (1976). This was made into a 1979 BBC Play of the Week in which Wallace was portrayed by Annabel Leventon. Her other investigations as a Sunday Times journalist ranged from the failure of concrete systems building and the 'hot-housing' of genius children to the Dioxin disaster in Northern Italy, about which she co-wrote the book The Superpoison (1979). ==SANE== Wallace founded the mental health charity SANE after writing a series of articles in The Times entitled \\"The Forgotten Illness\\" that highlighted the paucity of services and treatments for people suffering from schizophrenia. Initially focusing on schizophrenia, SANE is now concerned with all mental illnesses. SANE raises money for people with mental health problems. It established The Prince of Wales International Centre for SANE Research in Oxford and pioneered the UK's first national out-of-hours mental health helpline, offering practical information and emotional support 365 days a year. Wallace is the author of the 1986 book The Silent Twins, about June and Jennifer Gibbons, and she wrote the screenplay for the film of the same name. She also wrote and presented the television documentaries Whose Mind is it Anyway? and Circles of Madness, and has lectured on the subject of mental illness. ==Honours and awards== While a journalist for The Times, Wallace was awarded Campaigning Journalist of the Year for 1988. She has also been awarded Medical Journalist of the Year and received a British Neuroscience Association award in 2002. As a result of her \\"The Forgotten Illness\\" articles and her subsequent work in the mental illness field, she was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 2001.

It is a tree endemic to Peninsular Malaysia. It has been called Endau fan palm in English. In Malay the palm is known as bertam or serdang Endau. ==Taxonomy== Livistona endauensis was recognised as a new species relatively recently, being described in 1987 by John Dransfield and Khoon Meng Wong in a article published in the Malayan Nature Journal. The holotype was collected by Dransfield at 400 metres in altitude in 1977 on the Gunong Janing ('Janing mountain'), a mountain in the state of Johor, and has the collection number JD#5089. It is housed at the herbarium at Kew Botanical Gardens, with an isotype kept at the herbarium at the Forest Research Institute Malaysia in Kepong. ==Description== The seed is round and about 1cm in diameter; the testa intrudes shallowly into its surface. The eophyll, which is the first fully- expanded leaf of a seedling palm, has five ribs. ==Ecology== It is found in lowland open and closed forests. In the jungles where it occurs, it is found in a specific habitat on edaphically marginal, infertile soils on slopes, ridges and on hill tops. In such places it is a dominant part of the vegetation, but only in some areas. This is thought to very likely be due to being specialised on growing in sedimentary soil derived from granite or igneous rock from the Jasin complex. Other often conspicuous trees associated with this habitat are the dipterocarps Cotylelobium lanceolatum and Shorea blumutensis. It is found in an area where there were still a relative number of wild rhinos in the 1970s. ==Conservation== In 1998 it was assessed as a 'near threatened' species in the IUCN Red List, because its populations were severely fragmented, and there was a decline of mature individuals at the time. It was not evaluated in the Malaysia Plant Red List, published 2010. A population is protected in the Endau-Rompin National Park. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Image of Livistona endauensis (INaturalist) endauensis Category:Endemic flora of Peninsular Malaysia Category:Trees of Peninsular Malaysia Category:Near threatened plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by John Dransfield Category:Plants described in 1987 ","title":"Livistona endauensis"},{"id":"12354789","text":"Livistona mariae, also known as the central Australian or red cabbage palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is found only in Australia with the best-known occurrence found in Palm Valley in Finke Gorge National Park, Northern Territory. There are more than 3,000 cabbage palms in Palm Valley, many of which are several hundred years old and form a lush oasis among the rugged rocks and gorges. This region is now largely dry Central Ranges xeric scrubland. The palms are not relics from a previous age when Central Australia was much wetter, as previously thought. Aboriginal legend recorded in 1894 by Carl Strehlow describes \\"gods from the north\\" bringing the seeds to Palm Valley, which accords with the more modern research. == Common names == Vernacular names which have been applied to this species include: cabbage palm, central Australian cabbage palm, and red cabbage palm. == Taxonomy == A species of Livistona, palm trees of the family Arecaceae found in the horn of Africa, eastern Asia and Australia. L. mariae was found by Ernest Giles on his first expedition to the arid interior of Australia. The species description was published by Ferdinand von Mueller in his Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. Mueller referred to the taxon in an earlier work describing the Giles expedition, although at this time the name was published without a formal description. Mueller did not designate a holotype, but a lectotype was selected by Tony Rodd in his 1998 revision of the Australian members of the genus Livistona, from among the two specimen sheets at the Melbourne herbarium attributed to Giles. Based on morphology, Rodd provisionally considered the closely related taxa L. mariae and L. rigida to be conspecific, and thus subsumed L. rigida as a subspecies of L. mariae. Rodd also described a new third taxon from specimens collected by him in Western Australia, the subspecies occidentalis. He furthermore noted the partial misapplication of the name to L. alfredii by Mueller in the same work. Rodd's 1998 circumscription of the species is summarised as: * Livistona mariae F.Muell. :* Livistona mariae subsp. mariae – synonymous with Mueller's description of the population at the 'Palm Grove Oasis'. :* Livistona mariae subsp. rigida (Becc.) Rodd – previously described as a species by Odoardo Beccari. :* Livistona mariae subsp. occidentalis Rodd In 2004 the authors preparing a treatment of Australian populations of the family Arecaceae for the Flora of Australia, published a note that they would now follow Rodd's interpretation. In his 2009 monograph on the entire genus Livistona, however, John Leslie Dowe, one of the authors mentioned, once again recognised L. rigida as an independent species, rejecting Rodd's interpretation for the time being because he had stated it was provisional, and because he noted a number of morphological differences. Research that concluded a human agency introduced the plants to the area has resulted in changes to the population's taxonomic treatment and, consequently, required reappraisal of their conservation status as a species naturalised around 15,000 years ago rather than an endemic persisting since the Miocene era. == Description == A palm tree with shallow roots and large hairless fronds that are slightly waxy at the underside. The height of the plant may be over twenty metres, with leaves over four metres on long petioles of a similar length. The base of the tree becomes wider and raised at an advanced age, the trunk gently tapers to a narrower width toward the crown. A description of the larger groves of this tree, which had been bypassed by the Giles expedition, was provided by a minister at Hermannsburg community. ==Distribution== The distribution range of the nominate form is restricted to a locality known as the Palm Valley, an area where the Finke River passes through the MacDonnell Ranges. The isolated occurrence of this palm found over one thousand kilometres away from its nearest known relative at the time – the subspecies rigida – had been supposed to be a relict population. The isolation of the population was supposed to have resulted from the increased aridity of the continent since the Miocene period, around fifteen million years before the present day, or conveyed by a river or other means of dispersal. An analysis of molecular evidence found a separation from L. rigida was strongly indicated to have occurred around fifteen thousand years ago. Exclusion of other potential means for the introduction of the palm to the region, such as fruit bats or other mechanisms of distribution, left the most parsimonious explanation that it had been subject to dispersal by humans. This accords with the myths of local peoples, which allude to its deliberate introduction, the use as a resource and food, and its maintenance. ==Ecology== In the Palm Valley a subsurface aquifer has provided constant moisture to the groves, in an area surrounded by extremes of climate, and the trees occupy niches within the landscape that insulate them from periodic flooding. == Cultivation == The species is represented in cultivation by two of the subspecies, one from the central desert, the other from the tropical coast. Livistona mariae are slow growing palm trees that eventually attain a large height and an emblematic form. The subspecies L. mariae subsp. mariae is a desirable garden specimen referred to as the central Australian cabbage palm and presented as a feature plant. A specimen in an exhibition – along with the cycad Macrozamia macdonnellii from the MacDonnell Ranges – sought to demonstrate the horticultural potential of central Australia flora in modern gardens at the Geelong Botanic Gardens. A potentially tall tree with attractive foliage and fruit, Livistona mariae subsp. mariae has a may attain a height of 15 metres in cultivation. The surface pattern of the trunk is regular and neat in appearance, a feature of the persistent leaf bases of the earlier growth, and the width gradually narrows toward the crown. The leaves are reddish during early growth, forming fronds up to 3 m in length and extended out on a long petiole. The tree generally known as L. rigida, also misnamed as L. mariae subsp. mariae in horticulture, is similar in form to the central desert subspecies but potentially larger in size. The more robust trunk of this taxon may reach a height of 20 m and the leaves, also reddish when young, reach lengths up to 4 metres. This palm is best grown in Australia in the arid central regions, when provided with adequate moisture, and the wet tropical coastal to sub-coastal regions of the north-east of the continent, with the most success in gardens north of Coffs Harbour. Propagation of the plant is from seed. == Conservation status == The three subspecies are listed in various regional and national conservation plans, the status and trajectory of these populations is classified separately. This recognises an arrangement by Rodd that placed Livistona rigida and L. mariae and his newly recognised taxon in a subspecific arrangement. The remote population at Finke Gorge, once listed as L. mariae, is thus amended to L. mariae subsp. mariae for conservation purposes following its taxonomic revision. The significance of these palms was recognised in a national conservation plan intended to improve the trajectory of thirty Australian plants, actions that would reduce factors that threaten the trees with extinction. The classification by national EPBC legislation is vulnerable, with identified threats including an increased risk of fire as a result of invasive grasses, couch and buffel grass, alterations to availability of ground water and the impact of increased tourism. A large number of the trees are protected by occurring within the Finke Gorge National Park, some fringing groves of the palm are found on pastoral land and tourist areas and are subject to separate conservation actions. == References ==  Notes  == External links == * Livistona mariae at pacsoa.org.au/palms mariae Category:Palms of Australia Category:Conservation dependent flora of Australia Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Livistona mariae"},{"id":"12354796","text":"Livistona tahanensis is a species of medium-sized palm tree of the genus Livistona, found on only one mountain top in Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia. In Malay the palm is known as Tahan serdang, or as daun tau. T.C. Whitmore, writing in 1970, describes that the palms are seen after a four days' hike from Kuala Tahan, up the ridge behind Kuala Teku through tall dipterocarp jungle, until, suddenly, at in altitude up the slopes of the remote Gunong Tahan (Tahan mountain), the dense vegetation breaks and a low, stunted, small- leaved, upper montane forest takes over, continuing to , and in sheltered locations to . Out of this elfin forest, the stiff crowns of Tahan serdang grow as emergents, and the air is filled with the sound of the wind sighing through them. The palm hearts are eaten by wild elephants. ==Taxonomy== Livistona tahanensis was first formally described as a new species by the Italian palm specialist Odoardo Beccari in 1921. The name had in fact already been used in 1915 by Henry Nicholas Ridley, published in An annotated list of plants of Gunung Tahan, Pahang, Malaysia, with the understanding that Beccari would soon provide a description. The holotype was collected by L. Wray and H. C. Robinson at 1,000 metres altitude on Gunung Tahan, it is their collection number 5355, and it was kept at the herbarium of the Perak Museum in Malaysia. ==Description== This plant is a medium-sized, hermaphrodite fan palm, which grows up to in height, with a trunk diameter at breast height. The trunk has narrow leaf scars, and a narrow amount of space between each successive one, although this is usually obscured by the petiole stubs, which remain persistent, not falling off, for most of the length. The crown of the palm is globose (round), and it contains some 30 to 40 leaves. The leaves are costapalmate. For a Livistona the leaves are quite small: long, by wide. They are stiff and flat to undulate, subcircular, and divided regularly, splitting up the leaf blade into narrow segments or pinnae from its middle to some 58% of its length -these are forked or bifurcated at their end deep, or 16% of their length, and are not drooping, but rigid, and stiffly held up. There are 40 to 50 segments. The leaf blades are dark green on their upper sides. On mature trees the leaves are grey to grey-green on the undersides. There are six to seven parallel veins on each side of the midrib. The transverse veins thinner than parallel veins. The petiole is slender, to long, and spiny down its length. It is 12-15mm wide in the middle, but 5-6mm wide at the end where it joins the leaf blade. The adaxial side of the petiole, the upper surface, is flat, and it has scattered appressed hyaline (glassy-looking) scales, with ciliate hairs along their margins. Both left and right edges of the petiole have short, flat, brown, blunt, triangular, 5-8mm long spines down their entire length, these spines reduce in size as they march towards the leaf blade. The sheath is coloured dark, chocolate brown. The 'appendages', a bundle of fibres forming tongue-like straps on either side of the leaf-base, are bright mahogany red, and are polished on both sides. It is very long and membranous. The leaf or petiole-bases remain on the trunk for very many years, these have fine, prominent fibres, and slowly disintegrate on the tree as opposed to eventually falling off in one piece. The long inflorescence is unbranched at the base, and does not extend beyond the limits of the crown of leaves. It is branched to three orders, with four 'partial inflorescences', the longest of these growing to some long. The rachis bracts are loosely tubular. This species has no peduncular bracts. The peduncle is wide at its base; the rachillae are long, and are thin, green-red in colour, and with a tomentose indumentum. The minute flowers are coloured golden-yellow or cream. The sepals are ovate in shape, and are coloured a cream tipped in red. The in- curved petals are coloured cream, are oblong in shape, and their apex is blunt and thickened. The anthers are white. The style is short, and conic in shape. The pedicel is 2-3mm long. The fruit is coloured glossy green at maturity, with white spots. It is roundish, or slightly longer than broad, or the opposite, and long, by in width. The epicarp has a smooth surface marked with lip-like structures, with a suture line which extends for the full length of the fruit. ==Distribution== Livistona tahanensis is endemic to Gunong Tahan, a mountain in the state of Pahang, in the east of Peninsular Malaysia. It is only found between Tangga Lima Belas and Pangkin camps. In the limited territory where it is known to grow it is common. ==Ecology== The preferred habitat of the palm is a low, stunted, small-leaved, upper montane forest, sometimes called an 'elfin forest', on exposed ridges. The palm can be found growing at 900 to 1,400 metres, in some sheltered areas to 1,500 metres, in altitude. The stunted nature of the forest in this area of the Gunong Tahan is due to an underlying outcropping of quartzite, resistant to weathering, which cause the soil in this area to be composed of a layer of peat several feet thick, and nothing else upon the bedrock. It is moist in these montane forests. Here the stiff crowns of Tahan serdang grow as emergents, and are a significant, even dominant, part of the canopy here. There are wild elephants up on this mountain, and they destroy the plants by eating the cabbages and hearts of the palm. ==Conservation== It is likely naturally restricted in distribution, but it is common where it occurs. Because it is an endemic species, in 1998 the conservation status was assessed for the IUCN Red List, this being assessed as 'lower risk, conservation dependent'. It was not evaluated in the Malaysia Plant Red List, published 2010. ==References== tahanensis Category:Endemic flora of Peninsular Malaysia Category:Trees of Peninsular Malaysia Category:Conservation dependent plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Livistona tahanensis"},{"id":"12354807","text":"Loxococcus rupicola is a species of palm tree, and the only species in the genus Loxococcus.

It is part of the Fair Youth sequence, and the third sonnet of the Rival Poet sequence. ==Exegesis== The poet's strategy in this sonnet is to present himself as humble and less talented than the other poet, and to the urge the young man to at least value the poet's love. The sonnet uses nautical metaphors. The poet begins with a conventional seeming opening line, \\"O, how I faint when I of you do write”, causing the reader to expect, in a manner like Petrarch, that a list of the young man's virtues will follow. Instead it is revealed that the poet faints at the thought that there is a rival. The poet acknowledges that a superior poet is now using the young man's name, and is spending all his strength praising that name in order to tongue-tie the poet, which suggests the other poet does not have the substance of the young man as his primary focus. The young man's worth is said by the poet to be as great as the ocean, and can bear both vessels — the humble and the proud. The poet portrays himself as a smaller ship, that does \\"wilfully appear” (full of \\"Will\\"), while the other poet more resembles the large Spanish galleons (line 12), which calls to mind the English success with smaller faster ships against the more lumbering Spanish Armada. The young man is transformed during the sonnet from one who is at first vastly tolerant, to one who is then a ship wrecker, and one who might cast away a relationship (line 13). The first line of the couplet gives the young man the power to cause one to thrive and the other to be cast away, but the last line shows that is delusional, since the poet maintains his responsibility for his own decay, a word that Sonnet 79 confines to a lapse in poetic talent (\\"But now my gracious numbers are decayed\\").Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 270 .Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 100-102. ==Structure== Sonnet 80 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 10th line: × / × / × / × / × / Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride; (80.10) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The meter suggests a few variant pronunciations: the 2nd line's \\"spirit\\" functions as 1 syllable (possibly pronounced as spear't, sprite, sprit, or spurt), the 7th line's \\"inferior\\" as 3 syllables, and the 9th line's \\"shallowest\\" as 2. The sonnet exhibits some metrical variations, for example, an initial reversal in the 2nd line: / × × / × / × / × / Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, (80.2) Reversals can also occur mid-line, as occurs in line 5; and some may be optional, as the possible initial reversals in lines 1 and 13. Also possible is the rightward movement of the first ictus (the resulting four-position figure, \`× × / /\`, is sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): × × / / × / × / × / On your broad main doth wilfully appear.

Speedway returned to Barrow in 1972 back at Holker Street when the former Romford Bombers promotion who started the season at the West Ham Stadium in London moved the team north. The team were initially called the Barrow Happy Faces as their sponsor at the time was Duckhams oil - its happy face logo was prominently displayed on the team's race jackets. The team were renamed Barrow Bombers for the 1973 and 1974 seasons. Despite good crowds, a new home had to be found for the team after the end of the 1974 season, when problems with ground sharing became insurmountable.Bamford, R & Jarvis J.(2001).

In 1978 a team was entered under the name Furness Flyers, but finished bottom of the National League. Crowds were poor and the track closed after only one season. Speedway in Barrow was revived under ex-Barrow rider Chris Roynon in 1984. A series of challenge matches were held to gauge public support. Interest was such that a team was entered for the 1985 season under the name of the Barrow Blackhawks. After a disastrous start to the season with an understrength team, the Blackhawks were thrown out of the league. A number of challenge matches were held for the remainder of the season in front of low crowds before the track once again closed. ==ReferencesExternal links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20071022095136/http://home.clara.net/barrowfan/BarrowSpeedway.htm This link leads to a page unavailable message as of 15/05/2013 Category:Sport in Barrow-in-Furness Category:Defunct British speedway teams ","title":"Barrow Bombers"},{"id":"12354893","text":"The Public Service of Canada (known as the Civil Service of Canada prior to 1967) is the civil service of the Government of Canada. Its function is to serve as the staff of the Canadian Crown. The Clerk of the Privy Council, as Canada's senior serving civil servant, is head of the Public Service of Canada. The Public Service is divided into various subsidiary administrative units such as departments, agencies, commissions, Crown corporations, and other federal organizations. Over 40% of the Public Service of Canada is located in the National Capital Region, although there are employees working at approximately 1,600 locations across Canada. The Public Service of Canada is the country's single largest employer. ==Purpose== The purpose of the Public Service of Canada, as the non-political staff of the \\"executive branch\\" of government, is the day to day administration of the state and to the effective implementation of government policy and regulation in accordance with Canadian law. The civil service is responsible to the Crown (state) itself and not the ruling government or political party, In addition to the fundamental role of carrying out decisions taken by the ruling government, the public service also has a planning role, and may develop proposals and recommendations to Cabinet. It will also provide continued feedback and advice to government in all aspects of governmental affairs. ==Structure== In 2007, there were approximately 200 departments (e.g., Health Canada), agencies (e.g., Parks Canada), commissions (e.g., Canadian Grain Commission), boards (e.g., Veterans Review and Appeal Board), councils (e.g., Canadian Judicial Council) and crown corporations (e.g., Royal Canadian Mint). In a typical department, it is the minister who holds the respective portfolio who has overall responsibility for the management and direction of the department (i.e. the Minister of National Defence holds the Defence Portfolio, which includes many different organisations, one of which being the Department of National Defence). The deputy minister is the head of the department and is its senior serving civil servant, and therefore has responsibility for all of the department's day-to-day operations. However, it is always the respective minister who is held accountable to parliament for its operations. A variety of associate and assistant deputy ministers head the various sections of responsibility within a department (i.e. policy, finance and corporate services, environment and infrastructure, etc.). Within the jurisdiction of each Assistant Deputy Minister, is usually one to two Associate Deputy Ministers and beneath them two to five Directors-General who oversee more functional areas of each broad element of the department. Under Directors- General are Directors, who oversee various directorates, which are the core of any department. These directorates constitute the ground level in each department, and are the members of the civil service who implement state decisions, carry out research, and help to formulate proposals. Personnel Hiring Hiring (or selection) of civil service employees is typically done through a selection process that is either open to employees of the Public Service only (internal) or open to the general public (external). External processes are typically done to recruit a greater number of applicants. Conversely, internal processes may be held for positions where there is considered to be an adequate internal candidates and/or to provide opportunities for advancement within the civil service. The area of selection varies greatly depending on whether it is conducted as an internal or external process. The latter are open to Canadian citizens nationally, and sometimes internationally. Since the 2005 coming into force of the 2003 Public Service Modernization Act, selection processes focus less on a rules-based concept of best-qualified, and more on a values-based approach that enables managers to hire qualified and competent individuals whose experience, skills and knowledge are the right fit given the position's current and future needs.Government of Canada Public Service Modernization Act (2003) Federal civil service employees in Canada are employed by the state, but because of Canada's history and formal structure as a monarchy, they are often described as being employed by the Crown, who personifies the state and \\"enjoys a general capacity to contract in accordance with the rule of ordinary law\\".Smith, David E.; The Invisible Crown; University of Toronto Press; 1995; p. 79 Since the Public Service Modernization Act came into force in 2003, individuals had to take an Oath of Allegiance before they could assume their post. However, as of December 31, 2005, this is no longer a requirement, with civil servants taking an Oath of Office instead. Hiring in the core public administration is governed by the Public Service Employment Act, while other organizations hire independently. {  ! Year !

About 15% are scientists and professionals, 10% work in technical operations and 2.5% are executives. About 42% of Canadian civil servants work in the National Capital Region (NCR) (Ottawa-Hull), 24% work elsewhere in Ontario or Quebec, 21% in Western Canada, and 11% in Atlantic Canada. Since the headquarters of most agencies are located in the NCR, about 72% of executives work in this area. Canadian civil servants are also located in more than 180 countries (in the form of foreign service officers) and provide service in 1,600 locations in Canada. Approximately 80% of federal civil service employees are represented by a bargaining agent (union). The greatest number of civil servants are members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. They negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for blue collar workers and most administrative staff. Gender and ethnicity The Canadian Public Service has made significant efforts to reflect the gender balance, linguistic, and ethnic diversity in Canada. {  ! Sub-group ! Canadian Civil Service !

These officials usually served for an unspecified period (\\"during the pleasure of the Crown\\") for as long as they were deemed fit for the position. * 1849 — The responsible government began. At the time, there was a recognition that the roles of the political and non-political government officials needed to be defined and distinguished from one another. * 1857 — A statute entitled An Act for improving the organization and increasing the efficiency of the Civil Service of Canada enabled the Province of Canada to establish a Board of Examiners for the Civil Service. The role of the Board would be to examine \\"candidates for employment in the Civil Service\\" and \\"to grant certificates of qualification to those found to possess the moral character and fitness required for service\\". * 1868 — The Canada Civil Service Act was enacted, establishing a Civil Service Board with \\"limited jurisdiction over examinations, certification and promotional investigations in the Inside Service civil\\". * 1882 — The Civil Service Act is created, establishing a process for examining candidates for the civil service, with a three-member Board of Civil Service Examiners. * 1908 — The Civil Service Amendment Act creats the Civil Service Commission, to oversee appointments to government positions (the \\"inside service\\"). * 1918 — The Civil Service Act 1918 brings the outside service under the domain of the Commission, along with greater oversight with regards to appointments and promotions for members of the \\"inside service\\".Roberts, Alasdair. So-Called Experts: How American Consultants Remade the Canadian Civil Service, 1918-1921. Institute of Public Administration of Canada, 1996 * 1920s — The Commission created of a competitive system of examinations for appointment and promotion (a merit system) as a viable alternative to the patronage system. * 1921 — Formal restrictions were placed against the employment of married women. Women already holding permanent positions who married had to resign. These restrictions were not removed until 1955. * 1924 — The Civil Service Superannuation Act was created to promote and protect a career civil service. * 1932 — staff control regulations are established and Treasury Board is given authority over the Civil Service Commission's staffing responsibilities. * 1935–1957 — Top-level civil servants wielded enormous influence, typified by Oscar D. Skelton, Loring Christie, and Lester B. Pearson in external affairs, along with Michael Sharp in finance and Gordon Towers at the Bank of Canada.J. L. Granatstein, The Ottawa Men: The Civil Service Mandarins 1935-1957 (2015) * 1949 — The number of World War II veterans assigned to positions in the civil service under the statutory veterans preference rises to 55,000. * 1951 — The Financial Administration Act provides final authority to the Treasury Board for management (administration and organization) of the public service. * 1957 — The CSC establishes the Pay Research Bureau to provide objective information on rates of pay and conditions of employment in government and industry, and to recommend salary rates for civil servants. * 1961 — A new Civil Service Act is established to give civil servants the right of appeal against not only promotions, but also transfers, demotions, suspensions and dismissals. * 1962 — The Government adopts recommendations by the Royal Commission on Government Organization (Glassco Commission) on the management of the Public Service, including delegating authority to departments to manage their own personnel and to be held accountable for efficient performance. * 1966 — Bilingualism becomes an element of merit in the national capital area. * 1967 — The Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) and Public Service Staff Relations Act (PSSRA) come into effect. The PSEA gave the renamed Public Service Commission the responsibility for all the elements of the staffing process. The PSSRA created a collective bargaining regime in the civil service. * 1970s — The early 1970s saw rapid expansion of the public service. However, the late 1970s would see a significant reduction of public service. * 1979 — The Bilingualism Bonus is introduced for public servants who met the bilingual language requirements of their positions. * 1984 — The Commission on Equality in Employment issues its report, recommending that targets, rather than quotas, are the most effective means of achieving equity in the employment of members of under-represented groups. * 1986 — Further employment layoff programs again reduce the public service. * 1992 — Public Service Reform Act amends both the PSEA and the PSSRA. This provides more flexibility for managers to respond quickly to changing operational needs or to allow employees to acquire new skills. The Act also enabled the PSC to prescribe standards of competence to measure merit. * 1995 — A restraint-focused federal budget leads to further reductions (45,000) in the size of the civil service.http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/abt- aps/tpsc-hcfp/index-eng.htm * Late 1990s and early 2000s — rapid growth of the public service * 2003 — Public Service Modernization Act is passed and comes into effect in 2004 and 2005. The Canada School of Public Service is formed. * 2005 — a new Public Service Employment Act is released with significant changes to the staffing system. Recruitment is now the responsibility of Deputy Heads. A new Public Service Staffing Tribunal is put in place to deal with complaints of abuse of authority in internal appointments. The Public Service Labour Relations also comes into effect. The Financial Administration Act is also amended and provides for strong accountability on managers of the public service. ==See also== *Official Bilingualism in the Public Service of Canada *Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Bourgault, Jacques, and Stéphane Dion. \\"Governments come and go, but what of senior civil servants?

His father was a carpenter, who died early. After Johann finished his studies in Tübingen between 1831 and 1833, he began to work as a teacher assistant at different places, including Langenau and Ulm. After a further study as a school teacher, he went to Stuttgart in 1845 to teach at the elementary school. He became school master as well as the leader of the economic school in the city. In 1857 he gained the title of Doctor of Philosophy. Between 1862 and 1885, he worked as a professor later as a master professor at the Oberen Stuttgarter Realschule. As a poet, Fischer may be regarded as the last noteworthy representative of the traditional Swabian School. He was not in sympathy with the naturalism of his time, and was influenced chiefly by the poetry of his countryman Schiller, although several of his productions suggest the influence of Goethe, Hölderlin, and Mörike. Fischer developed his unique style in poetry and writing dramas during his years in Stuttgart. Early in life, he showed deep interest in nature and many of his poems show this influence. He excelled in popular songs and ballads, and in his love songs nobly idealized nature and passion. His 24 speeches on the occasion of the birthday of Schiller were especially popular. For his works, he gained the title of honorary citizen in Marbach am Neckar. Some of his admirers were wont to call him “Der schwabische Frauenlob” (the Swabian praiser of women). His seventieth birthday was a huge festival in Stuttgart. He died in Stuttgart. ==Works== His four dramas are: * Saul (1862) * Friedrich II von Hohenstaufen (1863) * Florian Geyer (1866) * Kaiser Maximilian von Mexico (1868) His other works, practically all of them published in Stuttgart, were: * Gedichte (1838) * Dichtungen (1841) * Gedichte (1854) * Aus dem Leben der Vögel (1863) In this work, he notes the characteristic phenomena of the psychic life of animals with the acuteness of a naturalist and the sympathy of a poet. * Neue Gedichte (1865) * Den Deutschen Frauen (1869) * Aus Frischer Luft (1872) * Neue Lieder (1876) * Merlin.

It's one of the Fair Youth sequence. Sonnet 88 continues the theme of a division between the two friends, based on their differing sense of values. The poet offers to support the young man's rejection of him by listing the poet's own faults, and in this way give double support to the young man.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 286 . The paradoxical ideas of self-wounding in this sonnet are outlandish enough, that it is difficult to accept a sincere desire for self-immolation on the poet's part. This is especially clear in the context of other sonnets in the sequence that deal with a division between the poet and the young man. The poet does reserve for himself the story-telling posture (\\"I can set down a story\\"), which includes the considerable powers of poetry, powers that have been a recurring theme in the sonnets.Hammond. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 86-87 ==Structure== Sonnet 88 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme, abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter lines, which is a poetic metre in which each line has five feet, and each foot has two syllables accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are regular iambic pentameter, including the first line: × / × / × / × / × / When thou shalt be disposed to set me light, (88.1) Each line of the second quatrain ends with an extra syllable known as a feminine ending: × / × / × / × / × / × That thou in losing me shalt win much glory (88.8) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. (×) = extrametrical syllable. The meter needs the word \\"virtuous\\" in line four to have two syllables. ==Analysis and criticism== A key to understanding this sonnet is found in the words \\"gainer\\" and \\"vantage\\". The speaker envisages an inevitable (i.e. \\"When\\"), vigorous and adversarial incident between the sonnet's \\"I\\" and the addressee, \\"thou\\". This conflict is established by the words \\"scorn\\", \\"side\\", \\"fight\\", \\"losing\\", \\"win\\", \\"gainer\\", \\"vantage\\" and \\"double-vantage\\". At first sight the sonnet's final couplet seems to confirm a subservience of the speaker to the addressee which was apparently established earlier in the sonnet and earlier in the sequence. In 1963 Martin Seymore- Smith said of this sonnet, \\"Not only does Shakespeare intend to love to the bitter end, but also he proposes to demolish the edifice of his own ego by this process of identification with the Friend\\" and that if we do not understand this \\"we have little chance of understanding the Sonnets as a whole.\\"Martin Seymour-Smith, ed., Shakespeare's Sonnets, (London: Heinemann, 1963), 156. In 1924 T.G. Tucker noted that \\"double-vantage\\" is from tennis, and apparently means that I, your opponent, myself get \\"vantage\\" every time I thus yield it to you\\".T.G. Tucker, The Sonnets of Shakespeare, Cambridge University Press, 1924, 165 In 2009 Fred Blick found, based on his research into the tennis of Shakespeare's time, that \\"double-vantage\\" meant a win i.e. two vantage points in succession after a score of deuce (reflected in the sonnet's number 8 – 8) to win a \\"set\\", just as it means today.Fred Blick, \\"Duble Vantage, Tennis and Sonnet 88\\", The Upstart Crow, (Vol. XXVIII, Clemson University, 2009, 83-90) The word \\"set\\" then also meant a bet or stake (see OED, v. B. trans., 14, and the Fool in King Lear, \\"Set less than thou throwest\\", presumably at dice, I, iv, 123). Tennis was in Shakespeare's day almost always played as a gamble or \\"set\\", hence the origin of the scoring call \\"game and set\\". This casts a new light on the typically Shakespearean resonance of the words in line 1, \\"set me light\\" (bet against me at scornful odds) and line 6, \\"set down\\". Fred Blick has also shown that after sonnet 88 the speaker of the sonnets becomes more critical of the addressee and less subservient to him. Sonnet 126, at the end of the Fair Youth sequence, finally condemns to mortality the \\"lovely boy\\" as a mere human, no more than an equal of the mortal speaker. Helen Vendler notes that the \\"doubling vantage that is the theme of the sestet of 88 helps to organize the whole Sonnet\\".Helen Vendler, The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1997, 385-386. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 88"},{"id":"12354936","text":" The FF.44 was an extensively modified FF.34 with conventional fuselage and tail unit and tractor engine. ==Specifications (FF.44) References== Category:1910s German military reconnaissance aircraft Category:Floatplanes Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engine aircraft FF.44 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1916 ","title":"Friedrichshafen FF.44"},{"id":"12354937","text":"Casady School chapel window Casady School is an independent, coeducational, college-preparatory school located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, founded in 1947 by Bishop Thomas Casady and the Episcopal Diocese of Oklahoma.

MSON courses use the Stanford University Online High School virtual seminar model and are taught by faculty from the other 19 Malone Schools currently participating in the Network. Each MSON course takes a blended approach and combines synchronous instruction (real-time video conference seminars) with asynchronous instruction (recorded lectures and exercises students complete outside of class). Representing a \\"virtual Harkness Model,\\" each MSON course enrolls no more than 16 students, allowing for active, real-time discussion. The Malone Family Foundation awarded Casady School with a $2 million scholarship endowment in May 2006. Created for students in grades seven through 12 who demonstrate outstanding abilities as well as financial need, the scholarship enables qualified young adults to benefit from an independent education. Interdisciplinary Studies In the Fall of 2021, Casady School will introduce its Interdisciplinary Studies Program. The course will be inquiry-based and intrinsically-motivated, and will boast five distinct features: • Team-Taught Courses: The new eleventh grade Interdisciplinary Studies course will be team-taught by both an English and History teacher. • Dual Credit: Eleventh grade students will receive both an English and History graduation credit on their transcript. • Inquiry-Based Learning: Eleventh grade students will explore in-depth topics related to “history and culture now” in a local context through project-and-problem-based learning. • Public Presentations: Eleventh grade students will complete collaborative projects that include community engagement and public presentations of their work. •Capstone Projects: Qualified, self-selecting twelfth grade students will have the opportunity to apply for an independent project that will include working with a faculty member and/or an industry-based mentor. Dr. Richard B. Hays of Duke University's Divinity School stated that,\\"Casady's new Interdisciplinary Studies program will seek to integrate study of the humanities with civic service. Historically speaking, that should not be surprising at all, but in our current environment, it sounds like a novel idea! I look forward to hearing more about this program's development towards producing graduates who are historically informed, intellectually reflective, and compassionately engaged civic servants.” ==Athletics== Casady students have the option to choose from 21 different sports that are offered during three seasons for the academic year. Casady School is a competing member of the Southwest Preparatory Conference and is a member of the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest. Casady School is also a members of Oklahoma City's Catholic Grade School Athletic Association for teams in grades 4-8. Since 1956 Casady has won 154 SPC championships. ==Religion== After the school was renamed Casady School on May 26, 1948, the Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor was completed thanks to the generosity of Frank Johnson Hightower. Ever since, the Chapel has been the spiritual center of Casady School. Today, more than 600 daily services are conducted during the school year, involving students of all ages. A $2 million Chapel expansion project was completed in 2011. Community celebrations of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter have a firm tradition. The Chapel is also used for baptisms, weddings, funerals and celebrations in the lives of members of the Casady family throughout the year. Casady students participate in Chapel services daily. ==Notable alumni== * Clay Bennett - NBA Oklahoma City Thunder owner, Oklahoma City businessman * J.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. ==Synopsis== The poet tells a youth that he can say he abandoned the poet for some fault and he will admit it. The poet will deliberately absent himself and stop discussing the youth, since he cannot even like himself if the youth no longer cares for him. ==The Quarto text== Stephen Booth notes that two of the known 13 copies of Q1609 read 'proface' in line 11, the rest have 'prophane', and that this evidences printing house correction while the work was in the press. ==Structure== Sonnet 89 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. However, in Q1609, quatrain two and quatrain three constitute a complete sentence running from line 5 through to line 12. Vendler suggests a 4-8-2 structure. Kerrigan and Burrow punctuate with a full stop at the end of line 7. It can be concluded that finding a clear 4,4,4,2 structure is not easy here. Sonnet 91 has a comparable variation from 4,4,4,2 to a 6-6-2 structure. Its rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is composed in lines of iambic pentameter, a poetic metre based on five feet in each line, and two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 4th line: × / × / × / × / × / Against thy reasons making no defence. (89.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The 1st line exhibits a common metrical variation, the initial reversal: / × × / × / × / × / Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, (89.1) This variation is repeated in the 3rd line. A mid-line reversal occurs on \\"knowing\\" in line 7. ==Critical Discussion== Gerald Hammond (The Reader and Shakespeare's Young Man Sonnets) contrasts his view of the group of sonnets 88–93 with that of Martin Seymour-Smith (in his headnote to sonnet 88 in his edition). Against Seymour-Smith's account of \\"psychologically peculiar\\" sonnets, in which the poet sought \\"to demolish the edifice of his own ego\\", Hammond asserts that the sonnets seek to \\"maintain and strengthen the ego, rather than destroy it\\". To contemporary readers, there may seem something 'passive-aggressive' about this sonnet: the emotional manipulation of the extremity of the language in \\"acquaintance strangle and look strange\\" looks like a strategy of overstatement, culminating in the statement that the poet is hated. The sonnet utilizes many and repeated pronouns: 'I' (seven times), 5 instances of 'me','my' and 'myself'. The opposing force to this is constituted of 'thy' four times, 'thou' three times, and a 'thee'. The main body of the sonnet, however, concludes with an expression of former mutuality \\"our old acquaintance\\". It is quite typical for a love poem to pivot between 'I' and 'you' (or 'thee'). Shakespeare seems to write knots of 'you' sonnets (as in the 'rival poet' part of the sequence: at 87 a new tonality came in with the dramatic announcement of 'Farewell, thou art too dear for my possessing'. In sonnet 89, the emotional severing of 'I' and 'thou' leads to a poignant and pointed reminder of 'our old acquaintance'. 'Old acquaintance' is a common enough term in the period, and appears elsewhere in Shakespeare, but it can carry a large emotional charge: Antonio in Twelfth Night is pained when Viola (as 'Cesario') does not respond to his impassioned words to a person he takes to be Sebastian; in Coriolanus, Cominius confronts an old acquaintance who will not answer to his former name, nor acknowledge a previous connection: Yet one time he did call me by my name: I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops That we have bled together. Coriolanus He would not answer to: forbad all names; He was a kind of nothing, titleless, Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire Of burning Rome. Hammond asserts that the concluding couplet, \\"wooden in rhythm and childish in its paradox... sums up the sterile argument\\" of sonnets 88 and 89. 'For thee, against myself' is the poet's argument, 'love' is now ruled out: the relationship has turned into the young man's imputed hate and the self-hatred espoused by the poet. The couplet does at least convey this stark reduction of 'old acquaintance' to hate. More importantly, it prepares the reader for the opening of Sonnet 90, 'Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now'. ==NotesReferences== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 89"},{"id":"12354981","text":"The Podocopida are an order of ostracods in the subclass Podocopa.

The term ' is also used for the modern German Army, the land component of the '. The German Army was formed after the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership in 1871 and dissolved in 1919, after the defeat of the German Empire in World War I. ==Formation and name== German Army hussars on the attack during maneuvers, 1912 Draftees of the German Army, 1898 The states that made up the German Empire contributed their armies; within the German Confederation, formed after the Napoleonic Wars, each state was responsible for maintaining certain units to be put at the disposal of the Confederation in case of conflict. When operating together, the units were known as the Federal Army ('). The Federal Army system functioned during various conflicts of the 19th century, such as the First Schleswig War from 1848–50 but by the time of the Second Schleswig War of 1864, tension had grown between the main powers of the confederation, the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Confederation was dissolved after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Prussia formed the North German Confederation and the treaty provided for the maintenance of a Federal Army and a Federal Navy (' or ').documentArchiv.de – Verfassung des Norddeutschen Bundes (16.04.1867) Further laws on military duty also used these terms.documentArchiv.de – Gesetz, betreffend die Verpflichtung zum Kriegsdienste (09.11.1867) Conventions (some later amended) were entered into between the North German Confederation and its member states, subordinating their armies to the Prussian army in time of war, and giving the Prussian Army control over training, doctrine and equipment. Shortly after the outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War in 1870, the North German Confederation also entered into conventions on military matters with states that were not members of the confederation, namely Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden. Through these conventions and the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire, an Army of the Realm (') was created. The contingents of the Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberg kingdoms remained semi-autonomous, while the Prussian Army assumed almost total control over the armies of the other states of the Empire. The Constitution of the German Empire, dated April 16, 1871, changed references in the North German Constitution from Federal Army to either Army of the Realm (') or German Army (').documentArchiv.de – Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs After 1871, the peacetime armies of the four kingdoms remained relatively distinct. The term \\"German Army\\" was used in various legal documents, such as the Military Penal Code, but otherwise, the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberg armies maintained distinct identities.Militär-Strafgesetzbuch für das Deutsche Reich Each kingdom had its own War Ministry, Bavaria and Saxony published their own rank and seniority lists for their officers and the Württemberg list was a separate chapter of the Prussian army rank lists. Württemberg and Saxon units were numbered according to the Prussian system but Bavarian units maintained their own numbers (the 2nd Württemberg Infantry Regiment was Infantry Regiment No. 120 under the Prussian system). ==Command== The commander of the Imperial German Army, less the Bavarian contingent, was the Kaiser. He was assisted by a Military Cabinet and exercised control through the Prussian Ministry of War and the Great General Staff. The Chief of the General Staff became the Kaiser's main military advisor and the most powerful military figure in the Empire. Bavaria kept its own Ministry of War and General Staff, but coordinated planning with the Prussian Great General Staff. Saxony also maintained its own Ministry of War and the Ministry of War of Württemberg also continued to exist. The command of the Prussian Army had been reformed in the wake of the defeats suffered by Prussia in the Napoleonic Wars. Rather than rely primarily on the martial skills of the individual members of the German nobility, who dominated the military profession, the Prussian Army instituted changes to ensure excellence in leadership, organization and planning. The General Staff system, which sought to institutionalize military excellence, was the main result. It sought to identify military talent at the lower levels and develop it thoroughly through academic training and practical experience on division, corps and higher staffs, up to the Great General Staff, the senior planning body of the army. It provided planning and organizational work during peacetime and wartime. The Prussian General Staff, proven in battle in the Wars of Unification, became the German General Staff upon the formation of the German Empire, given Prussia's leading role in the German Army. Military role in foreign policy decisions In the German Empire, diplomatic relations were the responsibility of the Chancellor and his Foreign Minister. The German Army reported separately to the Emperor, and increasingly played a major role in shaping foreign policy when military alliances or warfare was at issue.Gordon A. Craig, The politics of the Prussian army 1640-1945 (1955) 255-98. In diplomatic terms, Germany used the Prussian system of military attaches attached to diplomatic locations, with highly talented young officers assigned to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and military capabilities of their assigned nations. They used close observation, conversations, and paid agents to produce very high-quality reports that gave a significant advantage to the military planners.James Stone, \\"Spies and diplomats in Bismarck’s Germany: collaboration between military intelligence and the Foreign Office, 1871–1881.\\" Journal of Intelligence History (2014) 13#1 pp: 22–40. The military staff grew increasingly powerful, reducing the role of the Minister of war, and increasingly asserted itself in foreign policy decisions. Otto von Bismarck, the Imperial Chancellor 1871–1890, was annoyed by military interference in foreign policy affairs – in 1887, for example, they tried to convince the Emperor to declare war on Russia; they also encouraged Austria to attack Russia. Bismarck never controlled the Army, but he did complain vehemently, and the military leaders drew back. In 1905, when the Morocco affair was roiling international politics, the chief of the General staff Alfred von Schlieffen and called for a preventive war against France. At a critical point in the July crisis of 1914, Helmuth von Moltke, the chief of staff, without telling the Emperor or chancellor, advised his counterpart in Austria to mobilize against Russia at once. During the First World War. Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg increasingly set foreign policy, working directly with the Emperor—and indeed shaped his decision-making—leaving the chancellor and civilian officials in the dark. Historian Gordon A. Craig says that the crucial decisions in 1914, \\"were made by the soldiers and that, in making them, they displayed an almost complete disregard for political considerations.\\"Craig, pp 268-70, 283, 293.

Herwig, \\"Looking Glass: German Strategic Planning before 1914\\" The Historian 77#2 (2015) pp 290-314.. The basic peacetime organizational structure of the Imperial German Army were the Army inspectorate ('), the army corps ('), the division and the regiment. During wartime, the staff of the Army inspectorates formed field army commands, which controlled the corps and subordinate units. During World War I, a higher command level, the army group ('), was created. Each army group controlled several field armies. Army inspectorate Germany was divided into army inspectorates, each of which oversaw three or four corps. There were five in 1871, with three more added between 1907 and 1913.Günter Wegner, Stellenbesetzung der deutschen Heere 1815–1939.

The corps consisted of two or more divisions and various support troops, covering a geographical area. The corps was also responsible for maintaining the reserves and ' in the corps area. By 1914, there were 21 corps areas under Prussian jurisdiction and three Bavarian army corps. Besides the regional corps, there was also a Guard Corps ('), which controlled the elite Prussian Guard units. A corps usually included a light infantry () battalion, a heavy artillery (') battalion, an engineer battalion, a telegraph battalion and a trains battalion. Some corps areas also disposed of fortress troops; each of the 25 corps had a Field Aviation Unit (') attached to it normally equipped with six unarmed \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" class unarmed two-seat observation aircraft apiece.van Wyngarden, G (2006). Early German Aces of World War I, Osprey Publishing Ltd. In wartime, the army corps became a mobile tactical formation and four ' (Higher Cavalry Commands) were formed from the Cavalry Inspectorate, the equivalent of corps, being made up of two divisions of cavalry. The areas formerly covered by the corps each became the responsibility of a ' (Military District, sometimes translated as Corps Area). The Military Districts were to supervise the training and enlistment of reservists and new recruits. Originally each Military District was linked to an army corps; thus Wehrkreis I took over the area that I. Armeekorps had been responsible for and sent replacements to the same formation. The first sixteen Reserve Corps raised followed the same pattern; X. Reserve-Korps was made up of reservists from the same area as X. Armeekorps. However, these links between rear areas and front line units were broken as the war went on and later corps were raised with troops from all over Germany. Division The basic tactical formation was the division. A standard Imperial German division was organized into: * Division HQ * two infantry brigades organized into a brigade HQ and two regiments each (either of the line or light infantry), * a cavalry brigade organized into a brigade HQ and two regiments * an artillery brigade organized into an HQ and two regiments * Combat service and support regiments under division HQ One of the divisions in a corps area usually also managed the corps ' region ('). In 1914, besides the Guard Corps (two Guard divisions and a Guard cavalry division), there were 42 regular divisions in the Prussian Army (including four Saxon divisions and two Württemberg divisions), and six divisions in the Bavarian Army. These divisions were all mobilized in August 1914. They were reorganized, receiving engineer companies and other support units from their corps, and giving up most of their cavalry to form cavalry divisions. Reserve divisions were also formed, ' brigades were aggregated into divisions, and other divisions were formed from replacement (') units. As World War I progressed, additional divisions were formed, and by wars' end, 251 divisions had been formed or reformed in the German Army's structure. Regiment The regiment was the basic combat unit as well as the recruiting base for soldiers. When inducted, a soldier entered a regiment, usually through its replacement or training battalion, and received his basic training. There were three basic types of regiment: infantry, cavalry and artillery. Other specialties, such as pioneers (combat engineers) and signal troops, were organized into smaller support units. Regiments also carried the traditions of the army, in many cases stretching back into the 17th and 18th centuries. After World War I, regimental traditions were carried forward in the ' and its successor, the ', but the chain of tradition was broken in 1945 as West German and East German units did not carry forward pre-1945 traditions. Each Imperial German regiment of infantry had headquarters units, three battalions and one training battalion assigned to the regimental depot. Cavalry, field and horse artillery regiments were also similarly organized. National contingents The German Empire was formed by 38 duchies and kingdoms each with their traditions of warfare. Although the new army of the united German Empire was nominally \\"German\\", it was formed from separate national contingents which behaved autonomously: Nevertheless, in times of war, all of these would pledge allegiance to the Kaiser and the German nation.Sheldon, Fighting the Somme, 2017, p. 34 They did however remain organizationally distinct, being able to raise units of their own without assistance from the dominating Prussians. In one instance, Freiherr von Sonden (from Württemberg) was able to \\"quite legitimately send a request directly to the Ministry of War in Stuttgart for the raising of a new artillery regiment\\".Sheldon 2017, pp. 34–35 Regiments and units from separate constituents were also raised locally and often numbered independently from each other - for example, there was (among others) both a Bavarian 1st Infantry Regiment and a Württemberger 1st Infantry Regiment. ==Reserve system== When the British decided to reform their army in the 1860s, they surveyed the major European forces and decided that the Prussian system was the best one. That system was continued into the Imperial Army after 1871 and resulted in a modest cadre of professional officers and sergeants, and a large reserve force that could be quickly mobilised at the start of a war. The British could not use the system because they rejected conscription. The Japanese, however, were also observing the reserve system and, unlike the British, decided to copy the Prussian model. Barnett explains that every young man was drafted at age 18, with the upper-class becoming officers: : the Prussian system... was based on service of only three years with the colors... and four years in the reserve. The Prussian standing army had become simply a training cadre for the intake of conscripts. The Prussian army's organization for peace and war was virtually the same. Prussia was divided into army-corps districts for the purposes both of administration and of recruitment. On the outbreak of war the command organizations of the district became that of a corps in the field. Localization of the Army and its recruitment gave the districts pride and interest in their 'own' corps.Correlli Barnett, \\"Britain and her Army 1509–1970: A Military, Political and Social Survey\\" (1970) p. 285 ==Industrial base== The German Empire accounted for 12% of the global industrial output in 1914, it was the largest industrial base in Continental Europe, behind only that of Britain (18% of the industrial output) and the United States (22% of the industrial output). The Army closely cooperated with industry, especially in the World War, with particular focus on the very rapidly changing aircraft industry. The Army set prices and labor exemptions, regulated the supply of credit and raw materials, limited patent rights so as to allow cross-licensing among firms, and supervised management–labor relationships. The result was very rapid expansion and a high output of high- quality aircraft, as well as high wages that attracted the best machinists. Apart from aircraft, the Army's regulation of the rest of the war economy was inefficient. ==Air Force== The ', known before October 1916 as ' (The Air Corps of the German Empire),Grey and Thetford, P.xxix was the over-land air arm of the German Army during World War I (1914–1918). Although its name actually means something very close to \\"The German Air Force\\", it remained an integral part of the German Army for the duration of the war. The Kaiserliche Marine naval forces of the German Empire had their own, separate Marine- Fliegerabteilung maritime aviation forces, apart from the Luftstreitkräfte of the Army. ==Ranks of the Imperial German Army== The German Army from 1871 to 1914 inherited the various traditions and military ranks of its constituent states, thus becoming a truly federal armed service. Enlisted (') ranks * Musketeer (', Prussian army infantry regiments), Infantryman (', Bavarian army infantry regiments), Soldier (', Saxon army infantry regiments), Gunner (', foot artillery), Pioneer (', pioneer branch). Other unit-specific enlisted ranks were: Fusilier ('), Grenadier ('), Huntsman otherwise Light-Infantryman ('), Dragoon ('), Hussar ('), Cuirassier ('), Uhlan ('), Fusilier Guard ('), Grenadier Guard ('), etc. * Lance Corporal ('); up until 1918 the only rank (with exception of ' in the foot artillery) to which an enlisted soldier could be promoted, the rank was a deputy rank to the Corporal (')Duden; Origin and meaning of \\"\\", in German. rank.\\"Gefreiter\\" – Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste, Erste Section, A-G, (Universal Encyclopaedia of the Sciences and Arts, First Section, A-G), Author: Johann Samuel Ersch and Johann Gottfried Gruber, Publisher: F.

Christian tradition states that he was chosen by Saint Mark to serve as the leader of the nascent Christian community in Aquileia, and that he was consecrated bishop by Saint Peter. Hermagoras and his deacon Fortunatus (Italian: , Friulian: , Slovene: ) evangelized the area but were eventually arrested by Sebastius, a representative of Nero. They were tortured and beheaded. ==Veneration== Hermagor. Gornji Grad, Slovenia SS Ermagora and Fortunato's church-belfry, Lorenzago di Cadore, Veneto, Italy. \\"Hermagoras\\" was listed as the name of the first bishop of Aquileia. He was probably a bishop or lector living in the second half of the 3rd century or at the beginning of the fourth.Santi Ermagora e Fortunato di Aquileia santiebeati.it. However, because the name or origins of the very first bishop was unknown, Aquileian traditions arising in the 8th century made Hermagoras a bishop of the apostolic age, who had been consecrated by Saint Peter himself. As Hippolyte Delehaye writes, \\"To have lived among the Savoir's immediate following was...honorable...and accordingly old patrons of churches were identified with certain persons in the gospels or who were supposed to have had some part of Christ's life on earth.\\" Thus, false apostolic origins were ascribed to Hermagoras and the church at Aquileia. The tradition that Fortunatus was Hermagoras' deacon is also probably apocryphal, but a Christian named Fortunatus may have been a separate martyr at Aquileia. Hermagoras and Fortunatus may have been martyrs killed in Singidunum (today's Belgrade). There, around 304 during the religious persecutions led by Emperor Diocletian, Hermagoras, or Hermogenes, was a lector and Fortunatus a deacon. Their relics may have been brought to Aquileia a century later, and that city became the center of their cult as it was at Aquileia that the belief in their apostolic origin arose. Aquileia was one of the first cities in which Christianity could be practised unhindered; the Patriarch of Aquileia was the second most important person of the Western Church after the bishop of Rome.Hermagoras in Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon. Saint Ermagora by Matteo Giovannetti, about 1345. Gold and tempera on panel, 55 x 18 cm. Venice, Museo Correr Their feast day was recorded as July 12, which was further recorded in the Roman Martyrology, the Church of Aquileia, and in various other Churches. However, Venantius Fortunatus did not mention Hermagoras in his works, but mentioned the name of Fortunatus twice: once in a life of Saint Martin: Ac Fortunati benedictam urnam, and the second time in his Miscellanea: Et Fortunatum fert Aquileiam suum. The Martyrologium Hieronymianum mentions Hermagoras, but in a corrupted form: Armageri, Armagri, Armigeri. There is some confusion, as the Martyrologium Hieronymianum also lists \\"sanctorum Fortunate Hermogenis\\" under August 22 or 23. The Bollandists considered this simply a repetition of the same saints. However, the cult of Saint Felix and Saint Fortunatus of Aquileia was also mentioned in calendars for August 14. Hermagoras featured on the coat-of-arms of Hermagor Hermagoras' name survives in the Carinthian city of Hermagor, in the modern state of Austria. His cult was also popular in Udine, Gorizia and Gurk. The basilica of Aquileia today contains 12th-century frescoes, one of which depicts Hermagoras and Saint Peter. Hermagoras and Fortunatus have been particularly venerated among the Slovenes because they were Christianised by missionaries from Aquileia. Since 1961, St. Hermagoras and St. Fortunatus have been the secondary patrons of the Archdiocese of Ljubljana, re-established that year; previously, from 1461 until 1961, they were the main patrons of the diocese. In Slovenia, there are altogether seven parish churches and 25 branch churches dedicated to St. Hermagoras and/or St. Fortunatus. The oldest Slovene publishing house, established in 1851, is named the Hermagoras Society (Mohorjeva družba).

The first conductor to strongly advocate this approach to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach was the American pianist and conductor Joshua Rifkin in the 1980s. The use of solo voices in the choral music of Bach has also found champions in Andrew Parrott, Paul McCreesh, Sigiswald Kuijken and Konrad Junghänel. The approach is still somewhat controversial and recordings of Bach's music featuring solo voices in choral movements have met with mixed reviews. Proponents cite the fact that there are rarely additional copies of the vocal parts.10 Joshua Rifkin, ed., Mass in B minor Score, Breitkopf Urtext No. 5363 of the Breitkopf & Härtel Partitur-Bibliothek, 2006, Preface, p. XIV, Scoring, cited in Braatz (2010). p. 8 One reason for not favouring one voice per part is that there is evidence that Bach preferred to use more singers in performances at Leipzig. Furthermore, the presence, absence and omission of solo and tutti markings in scores, as well as the ambiguity in their meaning, brings further doubt to the question of whether Bach used more than one singer per part or not.Braatz (2010). pp. 12–16 The initialism OVPP was first coined in the Internet mailing list \\"The Bach Recordings Discussion Group\\" in the mid 1990s by Steven Langley Guy.

The Trail of the Eagles' Nests was first marked by Kazimierz Sosnowski. Since 1980, much of the area has been designated a protected area known as the Eagle Nests Landscape Park (). The castles date mostly to the 14th century, and were constructed probably by the order of King of Poland Casimir the Great. The trail has been named the \\"Eagle's Nests\\", as most of the castles are located on large, tall rocks of the Polish Jura Chain featuring many limestone cliffs, monadnocks and valleys below. They were built along the 14th-century border of Lesser Poland with the province of Silesia, which at that time belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The Trail of the Eagles' Nests is considered one of the best tourist trails in Poland, marked as No. 1 on the official list of most popular trails in the country.

It ostensibly started after the crash of Gol Flight 1907 in September 2006, and extended to January 2008. While the government has announced a series of measures aimed at mitigating its effects, no clear solution has been found.Al Jazeera English - News - No Survivors In Brazil Air CrashReuters AlertNet - FACTBOX-Brazil's deepening aviation crisis In Brazil the crisis has been dubbed \\"Apagão Aéreo\\" (\\"Aerial Blackout\\"), an allusion to an energy crisis which Brazil experienced between 2001 and 2002. ==Brazil's air traffic control system== Brazil's air traffic control system is run by the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). While some approach controls and control towers may have civilian controllers, the vast majority are military non-commissioned officers supervised by commissioned officers (with the totality of ARTCCs being staffed by the military, under a department called Department of Airspace Control (Departamento de Controle de Espaço Aéreo). Approximate areas covered by CINDACTA's four air-control regions. The air traffic control centers are known by the acronym CINDACTA, or \\"Centro Integrado de Defesa Aérea e Controle de Tráfego Aéreo (Integrated Air Traffic Control and Air Defense Center). Four CINDACTAs are in operation, located in four different cities and each responsible for different regions of Brazil's airspace. The use of military air traffic controllers for civilian traffic is not unusual, but has been deprecated in most developed countries. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates a wholly parallel system with that of the US Air Force and NORAD. This is also the case of Eurocontrol and each of its member nations' air defense systems. Brazil's use of an integrated command poses some unique challenges to the government. As members of the military, controllers are not allowed to form unions (such as the case of NATCA in the US) or to strike. While the air traffic control system saw significant improvement with the implementation of the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) in the northern portion of the country, there were many warning signs that the system as a whole was heading towards an untenable situation. In 2003, the Brazilian Air Force warned of the need for upgraded equipment and additional funding. For three years, budget requests submitted by DECEA, the Air Force department in charge of air traffic control, were denied. FAB warns of crisis since 2004. O Estado de S. Paulo The government's Tribunal de Contas da União (Union Accounting Tribunal), an agency similar to the US Government Accountability Office, issued a report after the crisis which echoed the FAB's concerns, stating that a lack of planning and underfunding of the air traffic control system by the federal government was to blame for the crisis. Budget cut and lack of planning caused air crisis, says TCU report Agência Brasil ==Gol Flight 1907== On September 29, 2006, a Gol Transportes Aéreos Boeing 737-800 collided with an ExcelAire Embraer Legacy 600 over the state of Mato Grosso, leading to the loss of 154 lives in what was, at the time, the deadliest air disaster in Brazilian history. It was also the fifth highest death toll of any accident involving a Boeing 737 behind Air India Express Flight 812, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610. The Legacy aircraft's transponder was found to have been off from 54 minutes before the time of the crash until 3 minutes after, when the crew turned it on again. Footage of the radar screens at the time of the incident reveals that the primary radar lost contact with the Legacy 28 minutes after Legacy's transponder was off. Gol Flight 1907 Final Report, CENIPA [Flight 1907: CINDACTA radar screens depict tragedy] Rede Globo (via YouTube) Following this accident, many technology and personnel issues were made public, pointing to the poor situation of Brazilian aviation's infrastructure and transforming the crash into a catalyst for the crisis. Brazilian aviation in chaos. Financial Times Facing the possibility of being blamed for an accident which--in their opinion--could have been avoided by appropriate corrective measures, the air traffic controllers decided to take protest action. ==Air traffic control chaos== A Brazilian Air Force 737-200, often used by the Brazilian President on domestic trips, pressed into service for TAM flights during the crisis. Following the Gol incident, the situation deteriorated rapidly, with controllers commencing a work-to-rule protest which culminated in massive flight delays and protests from passengers and airlines alike. The apex of the crisis occurred in December 2006. Due to a combination of equipment failures, understaffed ATC and the holiday travel season, travel at many Brazilian airports stopped altogether for some days. Flights resume at Brazil airports BBC News With the airlines unable to clear the backlog of passengers due to the canceled flights, and under pressure to solve the crisis from the general public, the government pressed into service several Brazilian Air Force jets, including one of the president's own planes. International organizations joined the protest by complaining of the work conditions experienced by the Brazilian air traffic controllers, citing long hours and low pay. Air Traffic Control in Brazil worries NGO Folha de S.Paulo At the same time, two different congressional inquiries were established to look into the matter. The executive branch's own inter-ministerial work-group concluded that the issue could be partly solved by both demilitarizing the air traffic control system and reinvesting the user fees and taxes levied on aviation back into the national air traffic control system. Work-group suggest demilitarization of air traffic control. G1.com On March 30, 2007, nearly 100 controllers walked out to protest their working conditions. Brazil promises quick solution to aviation crisis. Financial Times The walkout occurred soon after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva left the country for a summit with US president George W. Bush. Lula was reported to have said he felt as if he had been \\"backstabbed\\". Lula: Controllers \\"stabbed me in the back.\\" Josias de Souza, Folha de S.Paulo On July 21, 2007, a short-circuit at a communications relay shut down CINDACTA-4 for over three hours (from 23:15 to 02:30). While this incident was relatively short-lived, its consequences were emblematic of the crisis as a whole: 45% of the following day's flights suffered delays or cancellations. Short-circuit caused failure at CINDACTA-4, says FAB Folha de S.Paulo ==TAM Airlines Flight 3054== On July 17, 2007, a fully loaded TAM Airlines Airbus A320 aircraft ran off a runway at Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport, and crashed into a nearby warehouse, resulting in nearly 200 fatalities. The Brazilian press was quick to add this to a growing list of civil aviation woes, and pressed the government for changes. On September 31, 2009, more than two years after the accident, CENIPA announced the result of official investigations. The report said that one of the thrust levers, which control the airliner's engines, was in a power-on position when it should have been in idle, but it was not proved if there was mechanical or human failure as the cause of the accident. TAM Airlines Flight 3054 Final Report (PDF), Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center, October 27, 2009. Sem apontar culpados, Aeronáutica divulga relatório sobre acidente da TAM, Folha de S.Paulo. Familiares das vítimas do voo 3054 da TAM reclamam de relatório da PF, Globo G1 Notícias In addition to the positions of the thrust levers, the report listed several factors that may have contributed to the accident, as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, and the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway as a factor in the accident. ==Administration reaction== The administration's reaction began with an internal conflict between the military and civilian leadership on whether to negotiate with the air traffic controllers. Given their military position, they were not entitled to negotiate or press grievances outside their chain of command. The civilian government pressed for a pragmatic approach, while the military, with a view to guarding discipline, took a more hardline view. While the civilian government initially negotiated with the controllers, in June 2007, Lula's government sacked 14 military controllers and arrested 2 others for mutiny. Brazil's deepening aviation crisis Reuters With the public, the administration has been heavily criticized for sometimes insensitive comments. On June 9, 2007, asked by reporters what passengers should do while waiting for the delayed flights, the Minister of Tourism, Marta Suplicy, replied \\"relaxa e goza\\" (\\"relax and enjoy it\\"), a popular sexual expression relating to a supposedly advisable behavior for victims of rape, which can also mean \\"not to care\\". Marta apologized officially on the same day, expressing regret over an \\"unfortunate\\" comment. Marta on the air crisis: \\"relax and enjoy\\" G1.com Three weeks later, Finance Minister Guido Mantega tried to minimize the crisis, saying that the crisis was the price of prosperity. He said that he believed the crisis was due to the \\"increase in the flow of traffic due to the country's prosperity.\\" Mantega: air crisis is a signal of prosperity. Terra.com.br In July 2007, after the TAM Flight 3054 crash, a Rede Globo story reported that the airplane's right thrust reverser was inoperative at the time of the crash. A camera set up by Globo caught a top presidential adviser, Marco Aurélio Garcia, inside the Palácio do Planalto, apparently celebrating with an aide immediately after watching the newscast, ostensibly due to the blame placed on the federal administration's policies for the crash. The gestures, which were colloquially understood as being obscene, were widely condemned in the media. Lula aide apologizes for gesture after criticism. Folha de S.Paulo Relatives of those who died in the crash asked for their resignation. Lula's aide gesture upsets victims' relatives Ten months after the beginning of the crisis, in July 2007, President Lula made a statement on national TV, in which he acknowledged the existence of a crisis, and while he did not offer specific measures to improve the air traffic control system, he did commit the administration to solving some of the criticisms levied on Congonhas Airport.

It was written when Burns toured the Highlands in 1787 and first published in The Scots Musical Museum, 1790. It was written to be sung to the 'Cameronian Rant'. The song was written as an adaptation of a broadside by John Barclay, called \\"Dialogue Between Will Lick-Ladle and Tom Clean-Cogue\\". Burns knew that the Battle of Sheriffmuir had ended so inconclusively that it was unclear which side had won. That knowledge formed the basis for the theme of the song which is written as an account of the battle by two shepherds taking contrary views of the events that unfolded. One of the shepherds believes that \\"the red-coat lads wi' black cockades\\" routed the rebels, painting a fearful picture of how they managed to \\"hough the Clans like nine- pin kyles\\". The other shepherd is just as convinced that the Jacobites \\"did pursue / The horsemen back to Forth, man\\" with the eventual result that \\"...mony a huntit, poor Red-coat / For fear amaist did swarf, man.\\" ==The original manuscript of \\"The Battle of Sherramuir\\"== The original manuscript of \\"The Battle of Sherramuir\\". Dissatisfied with the first published version of the song, Burns revised and re-wrote it sometime after 1790. The revised version was published after his death by his editor, James Currie M.D. in The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author (1800). It is the revised version of the song, published by Currie, that is regarded as the definitive version of the song. Until recently the source used by James Currie to publish the revised version of the song was unclear. Equally, the academic, James Kinsley did not disclose the source for his analysis of the differences between the original and revised definitive version. In July 2007 the original manuscript containing Burns' revisions and amendments re-surfaced in the manuscript collection of the renowned Swiss manuscript collector Albin Schram. The manuscript was included as one of the most significant items in the auction of the Albin Schram Collection of Autograph Letters at Christie's in London which took place on 3 July 2007. It was acquired by an anonymous collector. ==Burns' revisions== The manuscript, in Burns' clear hand, also contained written notes by Currie thereby proving its provenance. The justification for the publication by Currie of all of Burns' revisions are contained in the manuscript. Burns dropped the chorus line of the original and made significant changes to stanza five and stanza six. In the revised stanza five, the more sceptical of the two shepherds blames the \\"Angus lads\\" for being too fond of their wooden bowls of porridge \\"cogs o'brose\\" to risk death in battle: > \\"The Angus lads had nae gude will, > That day their neebours' blude to spill, > For fear, by foes, that they should lose, > Their cogs o'brose; all crying woes, > And so it goes you see, man.\\" The last two lines are evidence of Burns' alteration of the original stanza five which read: > \\"Their cogs o'brose, they scar'd at blows, > And homeward fast did flee, man.\\" In stanza six, Burns changed the original lines: > \\"Lord Panmuir is slain, > Or in his en'mies' hands man,\\" To negate the more general observation about \\"en'mies\\" to provide a much more specific account: > \\"Or fall'n in Whiggish hands, man.\\" That Scottish Tories gave their lives, while Whigs ran away, is the final wry observation, enlarged from three lines to four: > \\"Then ye may tell, how pell an mell, > By red claymores and musket's knell, > Wi'dying yell, how Tories fell, > And Whigs to hell, > Flew off in frighted bands, man.\\" However, a pen stroke through these very lines indicates Burns' dissatisfaction with them and his earlier three-line version is allowed to stand on the final page: > \\"Say, pell mell, wi' muskets' knell > How Tories fell, and Whigs to hell, > Flew off in frighted bands, man.\\" The manuscript shows that Currie adopted the new four-line version, in the editions he published from 1800 onwards, despite the fact that Burns had rejected it. He also adopted the title used in his own endorsement, omitted one of the best lines in stanza two, and made minor corrections. There are other deleted lines or half lines where Burns contemplated changes. On the one hand, some deletions and insertions seem to result from Burns writing in haste and either miscopying or misremembering the original. All of the variations between the original version published in the Scottish Musical Museum and the definitive version published by Currie after Burns' death, including punctuation, are noted in James Kinsley's modern scholarly edition of \\"The Poems and Songs\\" (Oxford, 1968). Kinsley, however, omits to note that it was this manuscript, drafted by Burns, which led to the definitive version of the song published by James Currie. ==Acquisition of the manuscript by The National Library of Scotland== On 23 February 2009 the manuscript was acquired by the National Library of Scotland from Adams HamiltonAdams Hamilton - Literary and Historical Manuscripts - Archive Sale Listing of The Battle of Sherramuir the Washington, D.C. based literary and historical manuscript dealers.The Herald - Burns Treasure Bought by Library It was on display from 24–25 February 2009 at a Burns symposium in the US capital's Library of Congress.The Herald - Burns Poem on Show Cate Newton, Director of Collections and Research said, \\"We are delighted to acquire the only known manuscript of The Battle of Sherra-moor\\".

She had found that her mother's first lover was her younger paternal uncle Shantanu Bharadwaj (Vaquar Shaikh) and her mother also loved him. She tried a lot to remarry her mother to his uncle by going against the rules, priests and her grandmother Rajeshwari Bharadwaj (Sudha Chandran)'s order. She also marries Sumer (Sachin Tyagi) (eldest son of Chaturvedis) by forgetting her love Abhimanyu (Karan Singh Grover). Going to her in-laws, she got a new name, Shagun, and she got to know that Sumer does not love her and in Sumer's horoscope, there is death. She tried a lot to deny the death of Sumer.

The mall is in Clayton County and its trade area includes Henry County, one of the fastest-growing areas in Georgia. The mall is located along Interstate 75 and State Highway 54, also known as Jonesboro Road. ==History== Southlake Mall opened in 1976 to serve the needs of the growing southside of Atlanta. When Southlake opened, its anchors were Rich's, Davison's, Sears, and JCPenney. Rich's eleventh suburban store debuted at the mall in August 1976. The two- story, 230,000-square-foot store also had a restaurant and snack bar. The first major change was in 1986 - when the Davison's nameplate was changed to its parent company, Macy's. This lasted until 2003 - when Macy's closed all the older Davison's stores in Atlanta and consolidated to Rich's-Macy's. The standalone Macy's location closed in January 2003. The Rich's-Macy's store, once a standalone Rich's, lasted until 2005 - when it became a standalone Macy's. The only major renovation to the center was in 1999. The updates included a relocation of the food court to the lower level and the addition of a carousel. The escalators were moved to either end of the mall rather than only one near the center. The fountain was removed from the downstairs area in front of Sears and Radio Shack to accommodate one of the escalators. In January 2011, it was announced that JCPenney would close its store on June 1 of that year. On February 5, 2013, the mall fell into foreclosure - after several years of decline. Anchor spaces were not included in the foreclosure. General Growth Properties, then the mall's owner, which had just emerged itself in 2010 from bankruptcy, released its interests in the mall - citing its new focus to concentrate on stronger performing properties. The mall's mortgage was supervised for a short time in 2012 by C-III Asset Management before being sold to B Properties - a subsidiary of Bayer Properties that specializes in rehabilitating struggling malls. On May 31, 2018, Sears announced that it would be closing its location at Southlake Mall in September 2018 as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide - leaving Macy's as the only anchor left. The mall was sold to a joint venture between two New York real estate companies, CityView Commercial LLC and Jacobs Real Estate Advisors in January, 2019. The seller was Vintage Capital Group of Los Angeles. == References == Category:Shopping malls in the Atlanta metropolitan area Category:Buildings and structures in Clayton County, Georgia Category:Tourist attractions in Clayton County, Georgia Category:Shopping malls established in 1976 ","title":"Southlake Mall (Atlanta)"},{"id":"12355249","text":"Pelagodoxa henryana is a species of palm tree, and the only species in the genus Pelagodoxa.

The sole species is Phoenicophorium borsigianum. It is endemic to the Seychelles, being is fairly widespread on the larger islands of the group, such as Mahé, Silhouette, Praslin, and La Digue. It is found in forests, but is one of only a few native plants in the Seychelles that can colonise dry and eroded areas, as it is capable of withstanding full sunlight and periods of drought. A palm growing in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1857 was stolen, giving rise to the common name of 'thief palm'. ==Description== This palm is a fairly tall, solitary tree, with long leaves extending from the trunk. The stems are heavily ringed with leaf scars, formed by the loss of leaves, and bear black spines on younger plants. The leaves can reach up to two metres in length; they have a crinkled appearance due to the prominent veins, and are split at the ends with orange- edged serrations. The leaf stalks themselves may be up to half a metre long and are also armed with black spines. Both male and female flowers are borne on the same tree on an inflorescence that emerges below the crown. Small, oval fruits develop, which are orange in colour and may be up to 1.5 cm long. The leaves of the thief palm provide shelter for geckos and invertebrates as the pleated surface acts as an effective litter trap thus providing cover for small animals. Locals use the large, dried leaves for thatching. == Threats == This palm is adaptable and is able to colonise disturbed habitat; however, some populations may be threatened by fire (on Praslin), development, or invasive species. The harvesting of leaves is generally carried out in a semi- sustainable manner although local over-exploitation may occur.Gerlach, J.

It is a part of the Fair Youth series of sonnets, and the fourth sonnet of the Rival Poet series. ==Exegesis== The poet anticipates his own death, and includes the chance that the young man might die first. When the poet dies he will be soon forgotten, but when the young man dies he will live on as the subject of the poet's verse. This sonnet is distinct for its plain-spoken, simple collection of thoughtful statements. Most of the lines could be plucked out and joined at random to most other lines, and they would form complete and reasonable sentences. It is also distinct for its scarcity of metaphor.Empson, William. Seven Types of Ambiguity. New Directions (1966) p. 69 The poem, beginning with the first two lines, rocks back and forth between thesis and antithesis: \\"I shall live, you shall die, you shall live, I shall die …\\" The poem is a reconsideration of the idea that poetry can immortalize the young man. The previous sonnets in the Rival Poet group have hinted at retaliation for the young man's disloyal preference for another poet, and in this poem retaliation becomes activated as the sonnet considers how the poet will write his friend's epitaph.Jackson, MacD. P. \\"Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare's Rival Poet Sonnets\\". The Review of English Studies. Vol. 56, No. 224. Oxford University Press. (2005), pp. 224-246. The poet will have a common grave, but the young man is provided with a tomb in the eyes of men (line 8). The tomb's monument is the sonnet itself, which, in the way of tombstones, will be read by generations in the future. Line 11 (\\"And tongues to be your being shall rehearse”) contains a morbid pun as it envisions the re-reading of an epitaph to be like a re-burial (“re-hearse\\"). The couplet has the young man being finally entombed in men's mouths \\"where breath most breathes”. That could be either an important final resting place, as words are breath, and life is breath. Or it could be insignificant as a breath will vanish quickly. That difference is going to be significant in the rest of the Rival Poet group.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 268 .Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 99-100. ==Structure== Sonnet 81 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre of five feet per line, with two syllables in each foot accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are examples of regular iambic pentameter, including the 5th line: × / × / × / × / × / Your name from hence immortal life shall have, (81.5) The 2nd and 4th lines feature a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: × / × / × / × / × / (×) Or you survive when I in earth am rotten; (81.2) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. (×) = extrametrical syllable. The meter calls for line 8's \\"entombèd\\" to be pronounced as 3 syllables, and line 14's \\"even\\" as 1. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 81"},{"id":"12355274","text":"Phoenix rupicola (rupicola - Latin, inhabitant of rocks) or cliff date palm is a species of flowering plant in the palm family, native to the mountainous forests of India and Bhutan from 300 to 1200 m, usually occurring on cliffs, hillsides and similar terrain.

The service program was preinstalled on Western Digital NAS products, such as the MyBook World Edition, with three interface methods available to the user: specifically, Start, Stop, and Reset. Upon starting, the service established a connection across the Internet with MioNet. The client program was distributed in two formats: as a Java applet and an installable program. Both client formats could connect to the server, across either a LAN or the Internet, after first connecting to MioNet. The installable client program was initially required to register and associate the NAS with a MioNet account. MioNet then facilitated all connections to the NAS service. Once connected, the client could upload or download files to the NAS. WD Anywhere Access also offered premium subscription services, such as a remote desktop similar to VNC, and a remote PC drive similar to FTP. == Criticism == According to complaints posted on many Internet discussion boards, the MioNet product had a reputation for intermittently dropping access to the network drive through the MioNet utility. Many users who did not want or need access to their files from remote locations carefully removed MioNet from their My Book World II storage network servers. == Termination of Service == On 26 February 2015, Western Digital notified its MioNet customers that the service would be terminated on 31 March 2016.

It is one of the plants used for vegetable ivory. ==Names== The species epithet seemannii honors botanist Berthold Carl Seemann who collected some of the first specimens, including the lectotype. In Spanish it is called ' (), ' (), and tagua. In Colombian Spanish it is additionally known as '. In Cuna it is ', or '. In both the Quechua and Choco languages it is called '. ==Habitat== Phytelephas seemannii is native to Colombia and Panama, with much of it growing in shaded areas by rivers in lowland rainforest in Colombia's Pacific/Chocó natural region. It is usually found at elevations from in semi-deciduous forests. ==Subspecies== Phytelephas seemannii has two subspecies, P. s. ssp. brevipes and P. s. ssp. seemannii. P. s. ssp. brevipes is endemic to the upper Mamoní Valley in Panama, at or below in elevation, and may be a hybrid of P. seemannii and P. macrocarpa. ==Description== Phytelephas seemannii most closely resembles Phytelephas macrocarpa. However, the former has leaves that have fewer pinnae which are larger. Its trunk is also not upright but \\"creeping\\" and decumbent. The tree is generally less than tall, with inflorescences below the mark. Its spathes are double instead of in threes or fours. On the male flowers are only 36 stamens and not the hundreds of other species. The heads contain fewer fruits than other species, but inside are more nuts that are larger. Typically each fruit has 5 seeds protected by a fibrous coat, and each inflorescence has up to 8 fruits. Each tree can have dozens of inflorescences at a time. In immature seeds, the endosperm is a liquid, like in a coconut, and then later it hardens as the fruit wall softens and deteriorates. ==Ecology== Panama ivory palm trees flower after the end of the dry season, between February and May. The flowers are pollinated by insects, specifically by two types of rove beetles, pollen-eating Amazoncharis spp. and their predators in the genus Xanthopygus. The Amazoncharis beetles hollow out egg chambers within the male inflorescence, similar to how beetles in the related subtribe Gyrophaenina do inside of mushrooms. Squirrels and agoutis will eat the fleshy inner mesocarp surrounding the endocarp of the fruit, but do not eat the extremely hard endosperm. The rock-hard endosperm also makes the seed immune from most insect pests. Seed dispersers include the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), and lowland paca (Agouti paca). ==Uses== The seeds are traded at a regional international level as vegetable ivory, which is also called tagua. This commercial use is a threat to the species, but progress is being made on using more sustainable practices and conservation. As the tree typically grows only tall, it fortunately was not chopped down to harvest the seeds as was done with Phytelephas aequatorialis at the peak of tagua harvesting. The jelly-like liquid in the immature seeds, which later turns into the vegetable ivory, is edible. Occasionally in the marketplaces of Guna Yala the thin crust surrounding the ivory is sold as food. In Colombia the fronds are sometimes used for thatch. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * seemannii Category:Flora of Colombia Category:Flora of Panama Category:Conservation dependent plants Category:Ivory Category:Sculpture materials Category:Handicrafts Category:Plants described in 1912 Category:Non-timber forest products Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Phytelephas seemannii"},{"id":"12355313","text":"Phytelephas tumacana is a species of palm tree.

He was the second son of Wanyan Zonggan (完顏宗幹), the eldest son of Aguda (Emperor Taizu) (the founder of the Jin dynasty). He came to power in 1150 after overthrowing and murdering his predecessor, Emperor Xizong, in a coup d'état. During his reign, he moved the Jin capital from Shangjing (present-day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province) to Yanjing (present-day Beijing), and introduced a policy of sinicisation. In 1161, after the Jin dynasty lost the Battle of Caishi against the Southern Song dynasty, Digunai's subordinates rebelled against him and assassinated him. After his death, even though he ruled as an emperor during his lifetime, he was posthumously demoted to the status of a prince – \\"Prince Yang of Hailing\\" – in 1162 by his successor, Emperor Shizong. However, in 1181, Emperor Shizong further posthumously demoted him to the status of a commoner, hence he is also known as the \\"Commoner of Hailing\\". ==Background== Digunai was the second son of Woben (斡本; also known as Wanyan Zonggan 完顏宗幹), a son of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder of the Jin dynasty.

To legitimise himself as a sinicised ruler, in 1150 he lifted Emperor Taizong's prohibition of wearing Han Chinese dress, and adopted an array of Han Chinese practices and institutions, such as holding of sacrificial ceremonies in the northern and southern suburbs of his capital in 1149 (cf. ceremonies conducted at the Temple of Earth and Temple of Heaven in Beijing during the Ming and Qing dynasties), the use of the imperial carriage in 1151, a system of feudal rights in 1156, and the Song dynasty's shan-hu (山呼) style of court ceremonies in 1157.Tao, p.44 Digunai also introduced the imperial examination system in 1150 and set up the Imperial Academy in the following year. In his pursuit for greater sinicisation and the desire to acquire the Mandate of Heaven, Digunai moved his imperial court from Shangjing (present- day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province to Yanjing (present-day Beijing) in 1153. In 1157, he ordered the destruction of the imperial palaces in Shangjing. In contrast to the traditions of the Tang and Song dynasties, which rarely imposed corporal punishment on the members of the society's educated elites, Digunai continued the Khitan and Jurchen tradition of floggings with gusto, sometimes enjoying personally watching his subjects – including chancellors, censors, and a princess – beaten with poles or whips. == Assassination == Digunai's attempts to conquer the Southern Song dynasty and unify China under the Jin dynasty's rule ended in failure when his fleet was defeated by Song forcesTao, pp. 23–24 at the battles of Tangdao and Caishi in 1161. Many of his officers defected and in some places the people rebelled against him.Tao, p. 70 His subordinates conspired against him and assassinated him on 15 December 1161 in a military camp near the Yangtze River. Digunai's cousin, Wulu, who had led a rebellion against Digunai's rule, was proclaimed the new emperor. ==Family== * Father: Woben (斡本), sinicised name Wanyan Zonggan (完顏宗幹) * Mother: Lady Da (大氏), posthumously honoured as Empress Cixian (慈憲皇后) * Spouse: Empress Tushan (徒單皇后), bore Alubu * Concubines: ** Lady Da (大氏), Consort Yuan (元妃), bore Wanyan Yuanshou ** Tangkuo Dingge (唐括定哥), Consort Gui (貴妃) ** Lady Xiao (蕭氏), Consort Chen (宸妃) ** Lady Yelü (耶律氏), Consort Li (麗妃) ** Tangkuo Shigge (唐括石哥), Consort Li (麗妃), Tangkuo Dingge's sister, bore Wanyan Shensi'abu ** Pucha Alihu (蒲察阿里虎), Consort Zhao (昭妃) ** Alan (阿懶), Consort Zhao (昭妃) ** Lady Yelü (耶律氏), Consort Rou (柔妃) ** Lady Yelü (耶律氏), Zhaoyuan (昭媛) ** Lady Gao (高氏), Xiuyi (修儀) ** Lady Nan (南氏), Cairen (才人), bore Wanyan Guangyang ** Shigu (什古), Princess Shouning (壽寧縣主), Consort Zhao (昭妃), Wanyan Zongwang's daughter ** Pula (蒲剌), Princess Jingle (靜樂縣主), Consort Shu (淑妃), Wanyan Zongbi's daughter ** Shigu'er (師姑兒), Consort Shu (淑妃), Wanyan Zongjun's daughter ** Shaliguzhen (莎里古真), Princess Huntong (混同郡君), Consort Gui (貴妃) ** Chongjie (重節), Lady of Cheng (郕國夫人), Consort Zhao (昭妃) ** Nailahu (奈剌忽), Consort Yuan (元妃), ex-wife of Zhang Ding'an (張定安) ** Tangkuo Puluhuzhi (唐括蒲魯胡只), Consort Li (麗妃), cousin of Tangkuo Dingge and Tangkuo Shigge ** Pucha Chacha (蒲察叉察), daughter of Princess Qingyi (慶宜公主) * Sons: ** Alubu (阿魯補), sinicised name Wanyan Guangying (完顏光英), Crown Prince (太子) ** Wanyan Yuanshou (完顏元壽), Prince of Chong (崇王) ** Shensi'abu (矧思阿補), Prince of Su (宿王) ** Wanyan Guangyang (完顏廣陽), Prince of Teng (滕王) * Daughters: ** Henü (合女), Princess of Rong (榮國公主), married Tushan Sila (單術斯剌) ** Daughter, name unknown, married Xiao Yu's (蕭玉) son ** Daughter, name unknown, married Wugulun Yi (烏古論誼) == See also == * History of Beijing == References ==  Citations   Sources  * Jing-shen Tao, The Jurchen in Twelfth-Century China.

It is officially listed as a Critically endangered species. ==Description== This species reaches an incredible height of , with a smooth, grayish trunk up to in diameter. The large, spherical crown typically contains up to 30 ascending, spreading to drooping leaves, with the long and wide slightly wavy blades held on petioles or more in length which are abundantly covered along both edges at the base in medium tan fibers. The leaves, glossy green above and below, are divided to 2/5 into many pendulous-tipped segments, with the abaxial surface incompletely covered with scattered fuzz. The inflorescences are composed of 1-4 panicles, shorter than or equalling the petioles in length. The panicles are branched to 2 orders, with glabrous rachillae. The flowers are followed by large, shiny, black, mostly spherical fruits nearly long and wide when mature. It grows at elevations of , where it receives of rainfall per year. ==Distribution== Known only from twelve individuals, P. schattaueri currently occurs in moist, partially cleared, disturbed, tall, mixed ōhiʻa forest on gently sloping, rocky terrain from feet elevation in South Kona on the island of Hawai'i, where it receives of rainfall per year. Ten of the twelve individuals occur within 1,000 feet of each other among tall ōhiʻa trees in a cattle ranch, while the remaining two plants are a mile or two away, one in a macadamia nut orchard and the other in weedy, forest remnants. ==History== Pritchardia schattaueri was formally named and described by Donald Hodel in 1985, basing it on a collection that the late H. E. Moore Jr. of the Bailey Hortorum of Cornell University had made in 1980. The name honors the late George Schattauer, manager of Ho'omau ranch (the ranch of the late Jimmy Stewart), who came across these palms in 1960 while clearing land for pasture and macadamia nuts. Schattauer, who had a fondness for Hawaiian plants and an interest in preserving the flora and fauna of Hawai'i, recognized the significance of his discovery and left the palms standing. In 1969 and 1970, he sent fruits to Paul Wessich of Honolulu Botanical Gardens, who planted and grew them in the garden in Honolulu. The population is officially designated as an Exceptional Tree of Hawai'i. ==Cultivation and uses== Native Hawaiians valued the fruits of Pritchardia as a food source. The immature fruits, called hāwane or wāhane, were gathered and the endosperm was eaten (tasting like coconut meat). Leaves were also collected to use for thatching roofs, as well as for making fans, umbrellas, hats, and baskets. The trunks were also used for making spears and as material for construction. Hawaiian Pritchardia are especially popular among growers and collectors in subtropical areas or in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southern California, Southern Europe, and southern Australia, because they are more tolerant of cooler temperatures than their South Pacific counterparts, Pritchardia pacifica and Pritchardia thurstonii. ==Conservation== Pritchardia schattaueri is officially listed as a Critically endangered species. There are 12 individuals remaining in the wild, all on private land.Gemmill, C. 1998. Pritchardia schattaueri. 2011 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 9 July 2011. Threats include urbanization, severe habitat degradation, rats, pigs, cattle and weeds. No seedling recruitment and relatively small overall numbers prohibit regeneration. Its narrow, restricted range increases susceptibility to a single disruptive event, such as a hurricane or volcanic activity, and to potential damage from introduced weeds, animals and disease. Although all palms are mature and produce regularly, their habitat is so altered that regeneration is non-existent. All twelve plants are tall and old and perhaps approaching the end of their natural lives. Some have a generally unthrifty appearance, with much-reduced, hemispherical crowns of leaves and minimal flower and fruit production. In 2001, seed from all 12 Pritchardia schattaueri was collected by the Kona Palm Society. The Amy Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden ensured their propagation. A partnership was formed between the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy to reintroduce the endangered seedlings in significant numbers at the Conservancy’s Kona Hema Preserve. The Kona Hema site was selected for its close proximity to the founder seed trees, and also because the entire 8,000-acre preserve was fenced and free of hooved animals, something that had never been done at this scale in the Kona landscape. The site provided ideal conditions for protecting an out-planted endangered species and ensuring its survival into the future. Since the initial planting, many more seeds have been collected and planted. Because they came from a very small population, it was important to have as much genetic variability as possible, so the founder tree of each seedling was tracked and a GPS point recorded. Today there are over 600 Pritchardia schattaueri of various ages growing at Kona Hema Preserve, some more than 15 feet tall. ==Gallery== File:Post-4990-0-65561700-1389768696.jpg File:Pritchardia_schattaueri_(5249708993).jpg File:Pritchardia_schattaueri,_Koko_Crater_Botanical_Garden_-_IMG_2252.JPG File:Post-4990-0-56979300-1389769556.jpg ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *Pamlpedia schattaueri Category:Trees of Hawaii Category:Endemic flora of Hawaii Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Pritchardia schattaueri"},{"id":"12355379","text":"Pritchardia thurstonii is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

The leaves are long and arching, the bases of the leaf stalks sheathing the trunk. The leaves are pinnate, the centre stem or rachis being robust and brown, while the leaflets have a single fold and are shiny green above and waxy and bluish-green below. The main veins and the margins of the leaflets are spiny. This palm was for a long time thought to be the same species as Raphia vinifera, but that has proved not to be the case, the most obvious difference being that the flower stems of R. australis are erect while those of R. vinifera dangle downwards. ==Distribution and habitat== Raphia australis is endemic to Gaza Province in southern Mozambique and near Kwangwanase at Kosi Bay in KwaZulu Natal in South Africa. There are four subpopulations, the largest one being at Manhiça District in Mozambique where there are about 4,000 mature individuals. This palm grows in swamps, peat bogs and seasonally flooded dunes. ==Ecology== Raphia australis flowers when it is between twenty and forty years old, sets fruit and dies, although the dying process may take up to three years.

Also known by the Antanosy word \\"torendriky,\\" meaning \\"submerged trunk\\", R. musicalis is known for being the only truly aquatic palm tree. Like many mangrove trees, R. musicalis seeds germinate within the fruit, and the seedling takes root underwater. Endemic to Madagascar, R. musicalis was first discovered in 1993 by Henk Beentje on an expedition funded by the McDonald's restaurant. This palm is listed in the IUCN Red List. This tree is harvested by local people primarily for building material and food. Over- harvesting, habitat degradation and habitat loss threaten the remaining populations. Horticulturalists prize R. musicalis for its rarity and unique life history. ==Distribution== Endemic to southeast Madagascar, R. musicalis has only been found to live in three populations in the Belavenoka, Vatomirindry, and Ebakika Rivers. The Area of Occupancy, a measure frequently used by the IUCN to determine conservation status, is estimated to be only 7.25 square kilometers. Henk Beentje originally discovered the species in the Belavenoka River in 1993 during his primary expedition, while the Vatomirindry and Ebakika populations were found later in the 2000s. The Ebabkika and Belavenoka populations portray clear signs of palm tree harvesting and are dwindling at a higher rate than the remote Vatomirindry population. Ravenea musicalis does not appear to be thriving in any other location of the world. ==Habitat and ecology== Ravenea musicalis can be found in rivers with flowing waters that are 0.5-2.5 meters deep. It only grows to maturity on sandy river beds and seems unable to flourish on other soil types. It is adapted to warm, wet conditions, with precipitation averaging approximately 1680 mm/year and temperatures between 16 and 30 degrees Celsius. Lack of sufficient data makes the impact of R. musicalis on other species unclear. Not an ecologically dominant species, R. musicalis seems to be adapted to very specific environmental conditions. Ravenea musicalis has a unique life history. Its reproductive cycle more closely resembles mangroves than its fellow palms.The pleonanthic palm flowers every year. R. musicalis is dioecious, and female trees develop mature fruit during the wet season, in late February. Mature, floating fruits fall into the water where they are dispersed by the river away from the parent. Within each fruit is a single seed that begins to germinate while still inside the fruit. This seed is brown before germination and has a seed coat that is 0.2 mm thick. Once germinated, the seeds develop a seed leaf that is hooked in shape. The fruit containing the germinated seed splits easily with slight disturbance. Once the fruit splits open, either by rot or collision, the seed will sink to the bottom and travel along the river floor until it catches upon a projection. The seedling will then begin to develop and take root. The seedlings will typically develop three to four leaves that increase in size as growth continues. The seedlings and the juvenile plants develop entirely underwater, remaining flaccid so as to not uproot in the river current. The young palm will emerge from the water and become rigid as the trunk develops. ==Morphology== Mature R. musicalis ranges from 2.5 to 8 meters tall. The bottle-shaped trunk tapers down, with the broadest diameter of about 0.5 meters occurring at water level. The wood is soft and cream colored. R. musicalis is the only species in the genus Ravenea that lacks a layer of dense, hard, vertical black fibers lining the outer part of the stem, thought to benefit the structural strength of the tree. Fourteen to 16 pinnate ('feather-leaved') fronds emerge from the crown of the tree. They have been reported to reach up to 1.8 meters in length and have between 59 and 63 stiff leaflets, though the variation within the species can be considerable. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that is orange on the underside with thin, grey, tomentum. On the top, the sheath is proximally orange near the rachis of the frond, and distally green. The leaves are abaxially keeled with a glossy texture, and leaflets always occur within a single plane on either side of the rachis. Inflorescences in the genus Ravenea are always interfoliar. R. musicalis is one of seven species in the genus observed to have apparent multiple staminate inflorescences, though, like the rest of its genus, it has solitary pistillate inflorescences. Whether or not any plants in the genus Ravenea, including R. musicalis have true multiple inflorescence or false multiple inflorescence (a condensed branch system within a single prophyll) is debated. Staminate inflorescences occur in multiples of 5 and branch to 1 order. Pistillate inflorescences are solitary and branch to 1 order. Flowers and fruit Ravenea musicalis is dioecious and pleonanthic, like all Ravenea species. The flowers of R. musicalis open prior to the opening of the inflorescence. Little information exists on the flowers of this species, since no known expeditions took place during flowering season. The fruits of R. musicalis are orange and round, about 14–23 mm in diameter. Though most fruits in the genus Ravenea have a fleshy mesocarp, R. musicalis has a spongy mesocarp, allowing the fruits to float and rot. A single brown seed, which germinates within the fruit, is 10–14 mm across with a hard, black seed coat. The germinated seed has a half-inch long hooked seed leaf, and when the seed sinks, the hook catches on the riverbed, allowing the seedling to establish itself. ==Uses== Palm trees play a vital role in the lives of Malagasy peoples. R. musicalis is known to be harvested by local people for building materials and food. In the wet season, the wood is often used to build temporary canoes known as pirogues. In the learner dry season, the heart of the tree is harvested for edible palm hearts. This tree, like many palms, can be used for timber, fronds, and rattan. Additionally, palms like R. musicalis, can be used as a source of wax for cosmetics and be used in the kitchen in a variety of ways as source of oil, sugar, jams, heart-of-palm, etc. R. musicalis is also sought after by foreign horticulturists for their seeds due to the plant’s rarity and unique life history. R. musicalis is reportedly very difficult to cultivate, since the seeds need to germinate in water, and they rot if not cleaned after collection. ==Conservation== An assessment done in 2012 by Rakotoarinivo and Dransfield estimated that all members of Ravenea musicalis lived in a single population of around 450 individuals within the Belavenoka River. As a result, the IUCN currently has the species listed as \\"Critically Endangered.\\" However, a second expedition done in 2014 by Hogg and Henshall uncovered two additional populations of R. musicalis in the Ebakika River and the Vatomirindry River, as well as upping the estimated size of the population within the Belavenoka River. The 2014 survey counted 1797 mature individuals remaining, all located within the Belavanoka (1036 trees), Vatomirindry (726 trees), and Ebakika (35 trees) Rivers. Based on these estimates and IUCN guidelines, the Ravenea musicalis should be listed as \\"Vulnerable,\\" though, as Hogg and Henshall warn, extant populations could decline rapidly over the next few years in response to the increasing local human population and climate change, returning R. musicalis status to Endangered or Critically Endangered. Much of their potential habitat occurs on ideal land for the cultivation of cassava (manioc), rice and sugar cane. Additionally, the local population of Anosy people is growing at an estimated 2.9% each year, and as their population grows, so too does their need for the rich riparian soils. Plantations occupy large swaths of the Belavenoka and Ebakika Rivers, encroaching on R. musicalis habitat. Furthermore, since R. musicalis requires sandy rather than silty riverbeds, land conversion for agriculture may be disrupting the establishment of young plants. Already, ongoing harvesting threatens the population, especially in the more populated Ebakika and Belavenoka River areas, where R. musicalis trees were observed to have been felled, presumably for edible palm cabbage. They are threatened by logging/wood harvesting, as their wood is harvested for temporary canoes in the wet season, and the core of the tree is harvested for edible palm-hearts in the lean season. The Ebakika population suffers most from over-harvesting, and it has the lowest population. Climate models predict that southern Madagascar will be seriously affected by a harsher dry season within the next century. The salinization process and drying-up of rivers that may result both from climate change and from agricultural practices pose a serious threat to the water-dwelling R. musicalis. ==References== musicalis Category:Taxa named by Henk Jaap Beentje ","title":"Ravenea musicalis"},{"id":"12355463","text":"Ravenea nana is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae.

While often marketed in stores as a \\"plant\\" in a pot, in its natural state, the majesty palm grows to 98 feet (30 meters) tall. The palm has upward-arching leaves divided into long, thin fingers. It is native to Madagascar; however, it is believed only about 900 plants are currently alive in the wild according to an assessment conducted in 2010.Ravenea rivularis . (n.d.). Retrieved April 10, 2018, from http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/38677/0 The species grows in several regions of Madagascar, but because those regions are totally surrounded and separated by desert, the natural spread of the species is limited. Despite its fragility as a species in the wild, it has become a very popular houseplant due to its beautiful leaves and slow-growing nature. Ravenea rivularis grows in somewhat isolated humid habitats that are found in the otherwise dry, hot semi-arid climate of southwest Madagascar. Often, they grow huddled along the edges of riverbanks and natural lagoons, but also grow in shallow swamps where they receive ample water and humidity year-round. Due to its love for warm, moist air which can be difficult to provide consistently in most homes, the most common problem affecting those kept as houseplants is browning leaf tips. To replicate its natural growing conditions, plants should be misted with warm water daily or kept near a humidifier. It should also be watered more frequently than average houseplants especially in the spring and summer. That being said, fast-draining soil is preferable, such as soil labeled for cacti, in a well-draining container to allow water to seep through the root system and out of the pot. Although they can also suffer from lack of sunlight, Ravenea rivularis is much more sensitive to lack of water and humidity.Ravenea rivularis . (n.d.).

It is considered an aspect of gemilut chasadim (benevolence, selflessness, loving-kindness).Scheib, Ariel. \\"Visiting the Sick.\\" Jewish Virtual Library It is traditional to recite prayers for healing, such as the Mi Shebeirach prayer in the synagogue, and Psalms (especially Psalm 119) on behalf of the sick.Scheib, \\"Visiting the Sick.\\" Bikur holim societies exist in Jewish communities around the world. The earliest Bikur holim society on record dates back to the early Middle Ages. ==History== The roots of Bikur holim can be traced back to the Torah, when God visits Abraham after his circumcision (Genesis 18:1). Bikur holim is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud several times, in Tractate Nedarim 39a, 39b, and 40a. Nedarim 39a and 39b state that \\"[One must visit] even a hundred times a day\\" and that \\"He who visits a person who is ill takes away a sixtieth of his pain.\\" Nedarim 40a says that \\"anyone who visits the sick causes him to live and anyone who does not visit the sick causes him to die\\"; it also states that those who visit the sick are spared from the punishments of Gehenna (hell) and that God sustains the sick, citing the Book of Psalms Chapter 31.Psalms 31 / Hebrew Bible in English / Mechon-Mamre According to the Talmud, visits should not be very early or late in the day, and one should not stay too long. Relatives and friends are urged to visit as soon as possible. It is advised that a sick person not be informed of the death of a relative or friend lest it cause more pain.Nedarim 40a. Visiting the sick during Shabbat, often after morning services, is a common practice; the House of Shammai opposed this but the House of Hillel viewed this as a mitzvah and the view of Hillel became part of halakha. Additionally, in some cases it is permissible to travel on Shabbat if a close relative falls ill. ==Organizations == There are many Bikur holim organizations in the United States, Israel and the World. They are not connected but generally serve similar purposes. One example in the United States is the Los Angeles metropolitan area-based Bikur holim, also known as the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides life- saving services and social support programs for children, adults, and families suffering from serious and life-threatening illnesses.\\"How We Help\\".

The genus is named for Albrecht Roscher, a 19th-century German explorer, and the epithet for its single species R. melanochaetes derives from Latin and Greek meaning 'black' and 'bristle', alluding to the spines covering the trunks. They naturally occur on the Mahé and Silhouette Islands of Seychelles where they grow in mountainous rainforest and are threatened by habitat loss.Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms. Portland: Timber Press. / (Page 440–441) ==Description== Roscheria melanochaetes is a slow growing palm, the trunk reaches 8 m in height at 8 cm in diameter, usually straight, featuring distinctive rings near the crown. The trunks exhibit rings of black spines at each stem node, but this feature is most pronounced in young plants; as the plants age they grow fewer and fewer trunk spines, or none at all. Spines are also present on the crownshaft and petioles and these persist into maturity. The crownshaft is 3 m tall, light green in color, covered in brown scales, especially nearing the top. The crownshaft bulges in its center and holds 12–16 pinnate leaves, 1–2 m long on 15–20 cm petioles. The leaves are distinct in that the individual leaflets exhibit enormous variation; some have a single rib while others have several. They can be broad, narrow, pointed apices, while others are obliquely truncated. The leaves are light to bright green on top and dull green to brown underneath; but for the bifid apices, juvenile leaves are undivided and pink to red in color. Unlike most crown-shafted species, the inflorescence in R. melanochaetes emerges from the leaf axil rather than beneath the shaft. The much-branched panicle is 1–2 m with unisexual flowers of both sexes. Fruit matures to a 1 cm red drupe with one seed. == Cultivation == These plants will not tolerate drought or cold. Growing naturally in rain forest understory, they also require shade when young, as well as moist, humus rich soil. These particulars usually make the plant difficult to cultivate, even in tropical areas. == References == Category:Verschaffeltiinae Category:Trees of Seychelles Category:Monotypic Arecaceae genera Category:Near threatened plants Category:Endemic flora of Seychelles Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour Category:Taxa named by Hermann Wendland ","title":"Roscheria"},{"id":"12355503","text":"Sabal gretheriae is a species of palm tree that is endemic to the state of Quintana Roo in Mexico, where it is threatened by habitat loss.

At an early age, however, he was adopted by his uncle Takano Gensai who had studied medicine under Sugita Genpaku and influenced Chōei to follow in the same profession. He first studied medicine in Edo in 1820 after winning money in a lottery that he used to pay his way. There he first studied under Sugita Hakugen, then Yoshida Chōshuku, who gave him the name Chōei. After the death of his teacher in 1824 he took over some of the teaching duties in the school. A year later he left for Nagasaki to study under Philipp Franz von Siebold. There he paid for his education by writing papers about Japanese life and culture for von Siebold, gathering plants and translating books from Dutch to Japanese. One of his fellow students was Watanabe Kazan. After the school was shut down and von Siebold expelled from Japan in 1828, Chōei was forced to flee. He finally settled in Edo in 1830 where he wrote his Fundamentals of Western Medicine. There he was reunited with Watanabe Kazan, and both attended meetings of Shōshikai, a study group of intellectuals interested in foreign affairs. In 1838 Chōei married and then published Yumemonogatari (The Tale of a Dream), a book critical of the Tokugawa shogunate's handling of the 1837 Morrison Incident. Since he was of samurai status he was dealt with harshly by the authorities and sent to the Kodenmachō prison where he spent five years of his life sentence in the commoners' section. While in prison he wrote a treatise on Western learning in Japan called Bansha Sōyaku Shōki (\\"A Short Record of a Meeting with Misfortune\\"). The book examines the history of Western knowledge entering Japan from the Sengoku Period to the 1830s. In 1844 he arranged to have a fire started in the prison and made his escape. He then spent the rest of his life in hiding using various aliases. At one point he is said to have poured acid on his face to disguise his appearance and elude arrest. He returned to Edo in March 1850 and lived in hiding in Aoyama Hyakunin-cho (present-day Minami Aoyama). The area had a concentration of official residences of the Shōgun's foot soldiers and Chōei ran a medical practice under a false name. However, on the last day of October in the same year, an informant told police official where he was hiding, and the Edo Machi-bugyō sent a number of men to arrest him. The actual course of events is uncertain, but Chōei was severely beaten with jitte as he resisted arrest and was killed. Official reports stated that he drew a dagger and stabbed himself in the neck during the melee. A stone monument, inscribed with “The hiding place of Doctor Chōei Takano,” commemorates the location, and his grave at the temple of Zenko-ji in Kita- Aoyama has an inscription by Katsu Kaishū. ==Takano Choei former residence== The house where Chōei lived until he left for Edo at the age of 17 in Ōshū, Iwate has been preserved as a memorial museum. This Edo period samurai residence was designated a National Historic Site.高野長英旧宅 たかのちょうえいきゅうたく on April 13, 1933. The house was extensively restored in 1876, but retains two rooms facing the front courtyard on the west side in the original condition in which they were used by Chōei.

Named for its discoverer, Australian botanist William A. Schipp, the species is threatened by habitat loss. It is the sole species in the genus Schippia. ==Description== Schippia concolor is a medium-sized, single-stemmed palm with fan-shaped (or palmate) leaves. The stem, which is tall and in diameter, is usually covered by the remains of old, dead leaves (but in areas where fires are frequent the corky bark of the stem may be exposed throughout the length of the stem). Individuals bear six to 15 leaves which consist of a petiole and a roughly circular leaf blade which is about in diameter divided into 30 leaflets. The fruit are white, spherical and up to in diameter. ==Taxonomy== Schippia is a monotypic genus—it includes only a single species, S. concolor. In the first edition of Genera Palmarum (1987), Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus Schippia in the subfamily Coryphoideae, the tribe Corypheae and the subtribe Thrinacinae Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the Old World and New World members of the Thrinacinae are not closely related. As a consequence of this, Schippia and related genera have been placed in their own tribe, Cryosophileae. Within this tribe, Schippia appears to be most closely related to the genus Cryosophila. The species was discovered by Australian botanist William A. Schipp in 1932 and described by German taxonomist Max Burret in 1933. Burret named the genus in honour of Schipp. The holotype upon which the species (and the genus) was based, was Schipp's collection, assigned the collection number S367. This specimen was destroyed when the Berlin Herbarium was bombed during the Second World War. ==Reproduction and growth== Schippia concolor exhibit the unusual strategy of transferring all stored resources from the seed to the seedling before any shoot growth occurs. In most plants, the seedling remains attached to the seed, gradually using the stored resources for growth, until those resources are exhausted. At that point, the connection withers, detaching the remains of the seed. Eight to nine days after the seed is hydrated, the cotyledon expands, pushes out of the seed, and grows downward into the soil. About 20 days after germination, the cotyledon reaches a length of about and begins to swell. By the thirtieth day the lower are swollen, and about half the reserves in the seed have been mobilised. At about this point in time, the young root (the radicle) emerges. Sixty days after germination the transfer of reserved from the seed has been completed, but it is only after 80 or 90 days that the young shoot (the plumule) emerges from the cotyledon. ==References== Category:Coryphoideae Category:Flora of Belize Category:Flora of Guatemala Category:Monotypic Arecaceae genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Schippia"},{"id":"12355542","text":":See also Monkton (disambiguation).

It grows to 4-10m tall, with 8-20 leaves to 2m long. The leaves are bent at the end, with very hairy margins near the trunk, and consist of 180-320 slightly coiled leaflets irregularly arranged in several planes on the rake. The fruit are oval, greenish-yellow, 6–9 cm long. It is grown in cultivation. Seeds are difficult to germinate, with low rates of germination. Common names for it in Minas Gerais are baba- de-boi-grande and maria-rosa. Unlike most other species of Syagrus, this species started in 1879 as a Syagrus, as João Barbosa Rodrigues classified it along with Karl von Martius' S. cocoides. Three years later Rodrigues synonymised the genus Syagrus with Cocos (it was resurrected in 1916 by Beccari). It is quite similar to Syagrus romanzoffiana, but differs by being smaller, with smaller leaves and inflorescence, but with much larger fruit and female flowers. Unlike the spiral placement of the racemes (branches) of the inflorescence in S. romanzoffiana, S. macrocarpa has its racemes unilaterally arranged. S. cocoides also is similar, but has smaller fruit and spirally placed racemes in the inflorescence. Noblick, writing for the IUCN in 1998, mentions his concern that the scattered nature of the population might harm the species in the long term due to inbreeding. ==References== macrocarpa Category:Endemic flora of Brazil Category:Endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Syagrus macrocarpa"},{"id":"12355556","text":"Syagrus picrophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.

A small number under 100 individuals cling to the steep cliffs. The Jumagua palm has a gray trunk about 5 cm in diameter holding a spherical and very dense crown of stiff, spiky light green leaves that have almost no stalks and therefore sit very close together. A seed collection picked in 1996 by specialists of Palmetum of Santa Cruz de Tenerife resulted in various plants now growing in a handful of Botanical Gardens; specimens can be found growing at the Montgomery Botanical Center in Miami, Palmetum de Santa Cruz in the Canary Islands, Orto botanico di Messina in Italy and The Jardín Botánico de Las Tunas, in Cuba.

An annotated checklist of cultivated palms. Trithrinax species are spiny fan palms native to South America. They are resistant to cold, heat, wind, drought, poor soils and other adverse environmental conditions. Seeds germinate fast, but their overall growth rate is distinctly slow.Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms. Portland: Timber Press. / ==Description== Common features of Trithrinax species include: *Flowers: Inflorescences, in the order of hundreds of units. Flowers with three sepals, three petals, six stamens and three carpels. *Stem: Dead foliage is kept as a thick and spiny coat around the trunk. *Leaves: Fan shaped (palmate), composed of strong resistant fibers. *Shoots: Red coloured. ==Taxonomy== In the first edition of Genera Palmarum (1987), Natalie Uhl and John Dransfield placed the genus Trithrinax in subfamily Coryphoideae, tribe Corypheae and subtribe Thrinacinae. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses showed that the Old World and New World members of Thrinacinae are not closely related. As a consequence, Trithrinax and related genera have been placed in their own tribe, Cryosophileae. ==Habitat== Trithrinax species are spread along vast subtropical zones of South America: Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina. They prefer dry, open or forest clearing, environments, with moderate to cold winters.Jones, D. L. 1994.

It is a relative of the coconut, and is generally regarded as monotypic within the genus Voanioala. However, a team of geneticists headed by Bee F. Gunn found sufficient genetic variation within Voanioala to constitute at least two and possibly four cryptospecies. Voanioala is endemic to Madagascar, and is threatened by habitat loss. Voanioala is harvested for its edible seeds and palm heart. It is estimated that there are fewer than fifteen mature trees remaining. ==Description== The forest coconut is a Madagascan tree that can reach 15–20 meters high in the wild. It is supported by a strong root base, and its leaves sprout from the crown. Voanioala can reach up to 5 meters in height. The leaflets are waxy, green, and stiff, and seventy of them can grow from each side of a leaf. The fruit grows in groups at the crown with a thick reddish-brown color. Each seed is up to 2.8 inches (7 cm) long and 1.5 inches (3.5 cm) thick and is longitudinally grooved.Larry R. Noblick in The Palm Journal # 212 (Fall 2016) pp. 12 & 13 Figs 1 & 3. A scientifically remarkable trait is that each cell has about 600 chromosomes, which is extraordinary for a monocotyledon. ==Distribution== Voanioala gerardii is endemic to Madagascar, and is found in only the Bay of Antongil of the Masoala Peninsula, in the northeastern area of the island. It is extremely rare. ==Habitat== The forest coconut is found in the bottom of swampy valleys, as well as slopes in rainforests at an elevation of 200–450 meters above sea level. ==Conservation== Voanioala gerardii is critically endangered because of its scarcity. Only 10-15 trees are found. They are cut down for their edible palm hearts, and their seeds are used for market trade. They are also rare because of its poor dispersal of seeds. Habitat loss through agricultural logging threatens forest coconuts as well. The national park in Masoala Peninsula protects the forest coconuts on its property, and its future depends greatly on the effort of the national park. Its population is currently decreasing. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Forest coconut (Voanioala gerardii) Category:Cocoseae Category:Monotypic Arecaceae genera Category:Flora of Madagascar Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Voanioala"},{"id":"12355651","text":"Monica Marie Woods-Gray (born August 29, 1972 in South Bend, Indiana) is a meteorologist at an ABC affiliate in Sacramento, California KXTV ABC10.

The genus, established in 1837, contains some 20 species, but more seem to await discovery considering that 4 species - W. aequatorialis, W. lanata, W. minima and W. panamensis - were described as late as 1995. The genus is broadly divided into two groups. One group has the fruits tightly packed, while the other, formerly classified as genus Catoblastus, has fruits scattered along the inflorescence branches. It is not known whether these groups are both monophyletic. The genus is named after Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, of the House of Wettin.Henderson et al. (1995): p.111 ==Morphology== Palms of the genus Wettinia are monoecious, medium-sized to large, and typically solitary-trunked. They have a low, dense cone of brown or black stilt roots, and pinnate leaves. The rope-like inflorescences of the plant emerge from leathery spathes, and grow in a circular pattern around one or more trunk rings beneath the crown shaft. They are unisexual, fleshy, and cream colored or white. The fruit is small to medium-sized and elongated, green to bluish black in color. It grows either dispersed along the branches or in a tightly packed ellipsoid or sausage-like cylinder. ==Distribution== Members of this genus are found in Panama and in northern and northwestern South America (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, northwestern Brazil).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Although none of the species are frost-tolerant, they are found primarily in cooler and higher- altitude locations, up to 2,200 m in the case of Wettinia kalbreyeri, and are particularly prevalent along the foothills of the Andes. ==SpeciesGovaerts et al.

The film is a part of the Sabrina the Teenage Witch TV series franchise and is the second TV film made for the series following the 1996 Sabrina the Teenage Witch film, which was produced before the TV series went into production. The film features only two main characters from the TV series, the protagonist Sabrina Spellman (played by Melissa Joan Hart), and other main character Salem Saberhagen (voiced by Nick Bakay). The film introduces the character of Gwen (played by Tara Charendoff), a British witch, whom Sabrina meets in Rome. As the film is set in Rome, none of the scenes are set on the original set of the TV series. The film was directed by Tibor Takács, the director of the original Sabrina the Teenage Witch film. Takács also directed an episode of the TV series. Due to the success of Sabrina Goes to Rome, ABC produced a sequel titled Sabrina Down Under. This film again only included Sabrina and Salem from the TV series. Tara Charendoff reprised her role of Gwen for the second film. The film is included in the season 7 DVD release of the Sabrina the Teenage Witch TV series. ==Plot== If Sabrina cannot open a mysterious antique gold locket and release the power trapped within, her Aunt Sophia will be lost forever. \\"The secret to the locket lies in Rome\\", her father says. Sabrina heads for Italy and the Eternal City of Rome, for what was supposed to be \\"two cat-less weeks\\" to herself. Unknown to her she is accompanied by Salem who has stowed away in her backpack. Sabrina finds an unexpected roommate: Gwen, a British witch with a talking guinea pig named Stonehenge (nicknamed \\"Stony\\"). At the inn where she is staying, Sabrina learns that her Aunt Sophia was banished and trapped in the locket because she fell in love with a mortal who betrayed her and revealed to a friend that she was a witch. Later while traveling the city, she meets Paul, the gorgeous American photographer who catches her before she falls into the famous Trevi Fountain. Together, Sabrina and Gwen set out to solve the mystery of the locket. When Paul and his friend Travis witness Sabrina doing magic, while turning a walking statue to stone (that Gwen brought to life by accident) they come up with an idea to sell the story. In the end Paul doesn't betray Sabrina, which sets Aunt Sophia free, as the locket says \\"Trust your heart\\". ==Cast== * Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina Spellman, a teenage witch, visiting Rome to unlock the mystery of her aunt Sophia’s locket to stop Sophia being lost forever.(Aunt Sophia looks just like Sabrina hinting that Melissa Joan Hart acted as Aunt Sophia in her few appearances) She has to learn to trust her heart when she finds out Paul’s secret. * Eddie Mills as Paul, an adopted American photographer, who saves Sabrina from falling into the famous Trevi Fountain. Paul finds out that Sabrina is a witch, and he tries to get evidence on video camera, so that he can sell the story along with Travis. After Sabrina reunites him with his real family in Italy, he doesn’t want to expose her and destroys the video evidence. * Tara Strong as Gwen, a British witch whose spells never go the way she plans. She helps Sabrina unlock the locket. She has a crush on Alberto, who she accidentally turns into a pigeon. To change him back she has to kiss him, however there is no way of her knowing which pigeon he is. *James Fields as Travis, a friend of Paul's who intends to gather evidence to expose Sabrina as a witch and become rich. *Eric Alexander as Alberto, a handsome young man who Gwen accidentally turns into a pigeon. Determined to turn him back into a human, Gwen ends up randomly kissing pigeons in hopes of changing Alberto back. When she is about to give up, she relents on kissing a pigeon who keeps visiting her and Alberto is restored to human form. * Nick Bakay as the voice of Salem Saberhagen, a 500-year-old witch, sentenced to spend 100 years as a cat as punishment for attempting to take over the world. Salem stows away in Sabrina’s backpack and once in Rome, befriends Stony to gain free food from outdoor eateries, as people don’t take kindly to finding a guinea pig in their food. * Richard Steven Horvitz as the voice of Stonehenge ==Books== As part of the Sabrina the Teenage Witch book collection, a book titled Sabrina the Teenage Witch: Sabrina Goes to Rome is available. The book is credited to author Mel Odom and the film's screenwriter Daniel Berendsen. It is unnumbered, as is the second film's book adaptation. The other books in the series are numbered in reading order. The book adds in a subplot not shown in the film - featuring Sabrina's aunts back in Westbridge spying on Harvey and a mysterious girl named Tish. This also references previous continuity from the TV series, where Hilda has brought back the three butlers the aunts used to employ (as shown in season 1's \\"The Great Mistake\\").

The film features only two characters from the TV series: teenage witch Sabrina Spellman (played by Melissa Joan Hart), and talking cat Salem Saberhagen (voiced by Nick Bakay). Lindsay Sloane was also a regular actress in the TV series, but plays a different character in this film. Tara Charendoff reprises her role as Gwen from Sabrina Goes to Rome.

It was later released on a stand-alone DVD on February 7, 2017. Prior to this, the film has been released on VHS, and is available to stream on Hulu. == Plot == Sabrina travels to Australia's Great Barrier Reef with Gwen, a fellow witch from England, for a week-long vacation where they try to help protect a hidden mermaid colony whose habitat is threatened by ocean pollution, and by local marine biologist Dr. Julian Martin, who is determined to find the colony as his claim to fame. While Sabrina finds a friendship with Barnaby, a \\"merman\\" from the mermaid colony, Salem the cat finds a possible romance with another witch-turned-into-a-cat named Hilary, but finds Sabrina's problems interfering with his plans. In order to prevent Julian from launching a search for the mermaid colony, she casts a spell to create a storm to keep him in port, which succeeds except that a lightning bolt knocks Sabrina unconscious, and when she comes to she learns she has lost her powers, at least temporarily. == Cast == * Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina Spellman, a teenage witch, visiting Australia to discover the Great Barrier Reef, and meet marine biologist Dr. Julian Martin.

While taking a picture he discovered who had been polluting the ocean. * Peter O'Brien as Dr. Julian Martin, a marine biologist who spends his time protecting the reef. * Rebecca Gibney as Hilary Hexton, a witch imprisoned in the body of a cat. She begins to date Salem, however when she is turned back into a witch she says goodbye to him. * Conrad Coleby as Jerome, a boy whom Gwen gets attracted to.

The book is written by Ellen Titlebaum. It is unnumbered, as is the first film's book adaptation. The other books in the series are numbered in reading order. ==Differences between the film and the television series== *Lindsay Sloane, who played Valerie on the TV show, plays the mermaid Fin in this movie.

The Palm and Cycads Societies of Australia (PACSOA) describes this palm as follows: > \\"Very attractive palm with long (2-3m.) plumose leaves (hence the name > 'Foxtail'), and up to 10m tall with a grey trunk. It produces large (about > the size of a duck egg) orange fruit\\"Palm and Cycad Societies of Australia > webpage on Wodyetia bifurcata Accessed 3 May 2008 == Etymology == Most of the world was unaware of the existence of this 'spectacular' palm until 1978, when an Aboriginal man brought it to botanists and the world's attentionusbg.gov plant-collections Accessed 10 JAN 2018 The Aboriginal name of that Aboriginal man has been recorded as being \\"Wodyeti\\", thus the genus name for this Australian endemic species Wodyetia. The specific name \\"bifurcata\\" is from Latin meaning “divided into two parts”, in reference to the forking (\\"bifurcate\\") fibres covering the seeds. == Description == Flowering: White flowers stalk that comes from the base of the crownshaft. Foliage: Variance of greenish colors; deep green to light green colors. Received its more commonly known Australian-English name from the appearance of its foliage, which is in a shape of a fox’s tail. Fruits: 2 inches long. Olive green to green in the early stages. Orange red when ripe. Trunk: Similar to the king palm, the foxtail palm trunk is smooth, thin, and self-cleaning. It grows a single, double, or triple trunk that is slightly spindle-shaped to columnar reaching heights of about 30 ft. The trunk also has a closely ringed, dark grey to light gray color which slowly turns more and more white. The crownshaft of the foxtail palm is light to bright green and slightly swollen at the base.

It was described in 1978, and was classed as a rare palm, both within Queensland, and on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. After it became known to the world, the Foxtail Palm's seeds were so highly sought after that a thriving black market trade formed, with illegal collectors nearly decimating the in situ populations. The species propagates readily in cultivation and this ultimately reduced the pressure on the wild population. It has become widely distributed across the world, being progressively planted out as one of the \\"world's most popular\\" palms. Image:WodyetiaBifurcataBark.jpgCloseup of bark.

It covers the province of Ilocos Sur, on the island of Luzon. The see of the archdiocese is the city of Vigan.\\"Metropolitan Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 7, 2017 The archdiocese was erected in 1595 in the city of Nueva Segovia (modern-day Lal-lo, Cagayan). The see was moved in 1758 to Vigan because of its relative distance, at the request of Bishop Juan de la Fuente Yepes, during the pontificate of Benedict XIV. It became an archdiocese in 1951. The Archdiocese features the only Archbishop's Residence in the Philippines built during the Spanish Era. It is located just beside the Vigan Cathedral. The rear of the convent also had an access to nearby Govantes Dike, apparently a convenient exit point by sea, but it is no longer in use as the dike is no longer navigable. Both the Archbishop's Residence and the Cathedral itself remains to be one of the greatest contributions of the Order of Augustinian Recollects in the Philippines. The Archdiocese also operates its own radio station, dzNS (\\"NS\\" meaning \\"New Sound\\" and \\"Nueva Segovia\\"). It is known for being a truly neutral radio station. It is a member of the Catholic Media Network. The Archdiocese also operates a weekly newspaper, \\"Timek ti Amianan\\" (Ilocano: \\"Voice of the North\\"). ==History== The Diocese of Nueva Segovia was established together with Cebu and Nueva Cáceres by Pope Clement VIII on August 14, 1595 by virtue of the Papal Bull, Super Specula Militantis Ecclesia under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception. Its first bishop was Fray Miguel de Benavides, OP. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction extended to the provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, La Union, Pangasinan, Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Batanes, Mountain Province and five northern towns of Tarlac. Although Vigan was the oldest town created by the Spaniards in the north, it was not made the seat of the Diocese which was created for Northern Luzon since the preferred locale, Nueva Segovia, a city at the mouth of the Ibanag River in Cagayan, was by then already a flourishing Spanish settlement while Vigan was then only a pueblo, a town. Eventually however, the city of Nueva Segovia was gradually effaced by the floods of Rio Grande, and the seat was provisionally transferred to the nearby town of Lal-lo, Cagayan. On September 7, 1758, the seat was permanently transferred to Vigan, retaining the old name, up to the present. The transfer was made at the request of Bishop Juan de la Fuente Yepes during the Pontificate of Benedict XIV. The year 2008 marks the 250th year since the transfer. Nueva Segovia was elevated to an archdiocese, separated from Manila on June 29, 1951, by virtue of the Papal Bull of Pope Pius XII, Quo in Philippina Republica. As the other local Churches matured, there was eventual weaning from the archdiocese. Presently, it covers the civil Province of Ilocos Sur, with the Dioceses of Laoag, Bangued and Baguio, and the Vicariate of Bontoc-Lagawe as suffragans. The Most Reverend Santiago C. Sancho was the first archbishop of the newly elevated metropolitan church. Since Archbishop Sancho, there had been five other Ordinaries of Nueva Segovia – Archbishops Juan C. Sison, Jose T. Sanchez, Orlando B. Quevedo, Edmundo M. Abaya, Ernesto A. Salgado and currently, Marlo Mendoza Peralta who is 37th bishop and 7th archbishop. The civil province of Ilocos Sur, the locus of the Archdiocese, lies at the northwestern coast of Luzon, bounded on the west by the South China Sea, on the east by the Cordillera mountain ranges, on the north by Province of Ilocos Norte, and the south by the Province of La Union. Vigan, the capital of Ilocos Sur, approximately 408 kilometers north of Manila and 80 kilometers south of Laoag, is the seat of the Archdiocese. The land area of the province is 2,647 square kilometers of sandy, rocky and relatively fertile land. On the western side, there is a continuity of coastal plain where most of the towns and parishes are located. In the eastern side are mountainous portions where traveling and communication has been a challenge. There, roads are poor, few and far between. Eight towns in this eastern portion are sometimes isolated from the lowlands when the rainy season brings in heavy and continuous rainfall, making the mountain roads practically impassable. The Province of Ilocos Sur is home to 626,912 inhabitants, 513,186 of which are Catholics. The rest of the population is of other Christian denominations and other religions. The people are mostly rural. Cultural and ethnic groups and ancestry include the Kankana- ey, Bag-o, Itneg, Tingguian and the majority Ilokanos. The main dialect is, thus, Ilocano. Livelihood include farming, aqua-agriculture, small-time fishing, furniture carpentry and retail business as well as various industries like pottery and ceramics, weaving and bamboo craft among others. Farmlands usually owned in small sizes are hardly tillable for rice outside the rainy season due to lack of irrigation systems. During the dry season, some venture into alternative crops of tobacco, corn, garlic, onions and vegetables. The archdiocese is subdivided into five vicariates comprising 40 parishes all of which have resident pastors. Structures of participation and empowerment are in place – Pastoral and Finance Councils in all parishes. A number of educational centers contribute to Christian Formation of the young. There are two Catholic Colleges and eight Parochial Schools and several others ran by the Religious. The archdiocese maintains a complex of mass communications media – an AM radio station, DzNS (963 kHz) founded in 1968; a weekly newspaper, Timek ti Amianan founded in 1983; and a printing press, the Imprenta Nueva Segovia founded in 1995. Nueva Segovia is staffed by the archbishop with 74 priests in the ministries of the archdiocese together with hundreds of religious sisters and lay collaborators. Two seminaries exist within the archdiocese – the Immaculate Conception Minor Seminary, a high school seminary, and the Immaculate Conception School of Theology, the Regional Theology Seminary for Northern Luzon.

It was closed in July 1996 and turned over to the Japanese government in December 2006. Today it is home to the Yomitan Village Office and community complex, including baseball fields, running tracks, and community facilities. Yontan (Yomitan) Airfield was originally established by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1944 as . During the Battle of Okinawa on April 1, 1945, United States Marine Corps and United States Army forces seized the airfield on the first day of their landing. It was quickly repaired and became the first airfield on Okinawa to be used by the American forces. Later it was developed into a major American base for Army, Marine, and Navy aircraft. The Boeing B-29 Bockscar landed at Yomitan after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. ==Postwar use== After 1947, there were no units permanently assigned to Yontan and the base was used as an auxiliary installation for Kadena Air Base until the mid-1950s. Later it was placed in auxiliary reserve status. In June 1948, the 170th Airway and Air Communications Service (AACS) Squadron was activated at Yontan to provide air traffic control and communications support for USAF units in Okinawa. Shortly after, the 170th was redesignated as the 1962d AACS Squadron. The unit moved to Kadena AB and redesignated as 1962d AACS Group (later, Communications Group) on 18 February 1955. By 1950, Yontan was redesignated as a parachute drop training facility because its runways were not suitable for large scale or jet aircraft operations. By that time, local residents were started farming at the airfield with the tacit permission of the Air Force, and there were no fences installed on the base boundaries, except in administrative area. 33 serious off-range drop accidents occurred, including the death of a girl on 2 August 1950 when a fuel tank fell into private house, and an 11 June 1965 accident in which a trailer landed off target crushing a 10-year-old girl who was playing in the family yard. After the Okinawa reversion in 1972, the Japanese Government continued to make Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield (FAC 6027) available for USFJ requirements.Minutes of the 251st Meeting, Joint Committee established by Article XXV of the Status of Forces Agreement (PDF). Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Japan, 15 May 1972, pp. 82-84. Under the agreement of the 16th U.S.–Japan Security Consultative Committee in 1976, 250.78 acres of land at eastern portions of the airfield were partially returned to the Japanese Government in three release actions; 0.48 acres were released on 14 May 1977, 0.19 acres were released on 31 May 1977, and 250.11 acres were released on 30 April 1978. The remaining 191 acres were transferred from Fifth Air Force to the control of Commander Fleet Activities, Okinawa (COMFLEACTS Okinawa) on 27 July 1978. In addition, control of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield passed from COMFLEACTS Okinawa to Commanding General Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler on 9 October 1980. The last parachute drop training was conducted at Yomitan on 19 July 1996. Under the agreement of Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) Final Report, the parachute drop training was relocated to Ie Jima Auxiliary Airfield (FAC 6005). Yomitan was retained as an electromagnetic interference restriction for HF/DF operations at Sobe Communication Site. With the completion of the functional relocation of Sobe Communication Site into Camp Hansen, Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield was completely returned to the Japanese Government and landowners in December 2006. ==Major USAAF units assigned to Yontan== Location of Yontan Airfield In addition to the USAAF units, Yontan Airfield hosted several Naval and Marine Corps air squadrons equipped with F4U Corsairs, PBY Catalinas and F6F Hellcats. * Headquarters, Seventh Air Force, July 12, 1945 – January 1, 1946 * Headquarters, VII Bomber Command, July 1945 – March 1946 * Headquarters, 38th Bombardment Group ::B-25 Mitchell, July 25 – November 22, 1945 : 71st Bombardment Squadron, July 25 – November 22, 1945 : 405th Bombardment Squadron, July 25 – November 21, 1945 : 822d Bombardment Squadron, July 25 – November 22, 1945 : 823d Bombardment Squadron, July 25 – November 21, 1945 * 41st Bombardment Group Seventh Air Force :: B-25 Mitchell, June 7 – December 13, 1945 : 47th Bombardment Squadron, June 7 – December 13, 1945 : 48th Bombardment Squadron, June 7 – December 13, 1945 : 396th Bombardment Squadron, June 7 – December 13, 1945 : 820th Bombardment Squadron, June 7 – December 13, 1945 * 494th Bombardment Group Seventh Air Force :: B-24 Liberator, June 24 – December 8, 1945 : 373d Bombardment Squadron, July 21 – December 15, 1945 : 864th Bombardment Squadron, June 24 – December 13, 1945 : 865th Bombardment Squadron, June 24 – December 13, 1945 : 866th Bombardment Squadron, June 24 – December 13, 1945 : 867th Bombardment Squadron, June 24 – December 13, 1945 * 35th Fighter Group Fifth Air Force :: P-51 Mustang, June 28 – October 1945 : 39th Fighter Squadron, June 30 – October 10, 1945 : 40th Fighter Squadron, June 30 – October 10, 1945 : 41st Fighter Squadron, June 30 – October 10, 1945 * 312th Bombardment Group Fifth Air Force :: A-20 Havoc August 13 – December 13, 1945 : 386th Bombardment Squadron, August 13 – November 28, 1945 (B-32 Dominator) : 387th Bombardment Squadron, August 13 – December 13, 1945 : 388th Bombardment Squadron, September – December 13, 1945 : 389th Bombardment Squadron, September – December 9, 1945 * 413th Fighter Group, Eighth/Twentieth Air Force* :: P-47 Thunderbolt January 29 – October 1946 : 1st Fighter Squadron, January 29 – October 15, 1946 : 21st Fighter Squadron, January 29 – October 15, 1946 : 34th Fighter Squadron, January 29 – October 15, 1946 * 507th Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force :: P-47 Thunderbolt, January 29 – May 27, 1946 : 463d Fighter Squadron, January 29 – May 27, 1946 : 464th Fighter Squadron, January 29 – May 27, 1946 : 465th Fighter Squadron, January 29 – May 27, 1946 * 51st Fighter Group, Twentieth Air Force :: P-47 Thunderbolt, October 15, 1946 – May 22, 1947 : 16th Fighter Squadron, 15 October 1946-22 May 1947 : 25th Fighter Squadron, 15 October 1946-22 May 1947 : 26th Fighter Squadron, 15 October 1946-22 May 1947 * 4th Fighter Squadron (All Weather) (347th Fighter Group), February 20, 1947 – August 19, 1948 (P-61 Black Widow) VMF-311 at Yontan Airfield during Battle of Okinawa * Eighth Air Force was reassigned to Mac Dill AAF, Florida on June 7, 1946.

The livery changed to a bright green and cream livery with a stylised \\"YR\\" logo, plus the name \\"Yorkshire Rider\\", with an area on the logo that incorporated the town in which the garage for that bus was located. In October 1988 Yorkshire Rider was sold in a management buyout.Part 3 - 1986 to 1990 Yorkshire Rider the early days West Yorkshire Buses In August 1989 West Yorkshire Road Car Co was purchased from AJS Holdings with services in Bradford, Leeds and Otley. In April 1994 Yorkshire Rider was sold to Badgerline who in June 1995 merged with GRT Group to form FirstBus.Part 4 - 1991 to 1994 Rider Group expansion West Yorkshire Buses In September 1995 Yorkshire Rider was split into separate divisions: Part 5 - 1995 to 1997 Badgerline & FirstBus, new names, new liveries West Yorkshire Buses *Bradford Traveller - covering Bradford with a depot at Bowling Back Lane *Calderline - covering Halifax and Calderdale with depots in Halifax and Todmorden *Kingfisher Huddersfield - covering Kirklees with a depot at Old Fieldhouse Lane *Leeds City Link - covering the Leeds area with depots in Bramley, Hunslet and Cherry Row In February 1998 all were renamed as First Bradford, First Calderdale, First Huddersfield and First Leeds as part of the rollout of the FirstGroup brand.Part 6 - 1997 to 1999 The early Metrobus era West Yorkshire Buses During the early 2000s, several were merged. First Quickstep were based at the same Kirkstall Road depot as First Leeds but as a separate entity running several services around the Leeds area until it was merged into First Leeds' operation, while First Calderdale and First Huddersfield merged in 2003 to form First Calderdale & Huddersfield. In July 2005, First Leeds took over Morley based Black Prince Buses.Anticipated acquisition by First West Yorkshire Limited of Black Prince Buses Limited Office of Fair TradingFarewell to the prince of buses Morley Observer & Advertiser 19 February 2008 On 18 May 2008 First Leeds' Kirkstall Road depot was closed after 111 years of public use and operations moved to a new complex in Hunslet. During 2009, the management of the three First companies in West Yorkshire plus First York were centralised. ==Services== First West Yorkshire operate the majority of the services in the Bradford, Calderdale, Huddersfield and Leeds areas, consisting of local services serving different areas of towns and cities of Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds and Todmorden, and town- to-town services. The companies also runs services in North Yorkshire (X84), Lancashire (517, 589 and 592) and Greater Manchester (589 and 590). The 184, which operates from Huddersfield to Manchester, was previously a joint operation with First West Yorkshire and First Greater Manchester, however the service is now wholly operated by the latter. Overground In the last few years, First has introduced Overground services on services with a frequent daytime service. The Overground is now a prominent fixture on all First bus companies in the UK and is based on the London Underground network with each service having its own colour line. The towns and cities of Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield and Leeds each have their own Overground routes, with some services overlapping to another area's Overground map, such as the 184 (Purple Line in Huddersfield and Greater Manchester), 363/X63 (Brown Line in Bradford and Huddersfield), the 503 (Orange Line in Halifax and Huddersfield) and the 576 (Lime Green Line in Halifax and Bradford). ftr On 3 January 2007, a new concept of public transport was introduced to Leeds, the FTR, on the Olive Line 4 service from Whinmoor to Pudsey. It is the second scheme to be introduced by FirstGroup after the first scheme in York. However the scheme in York faced many troubles including underpowering of the engine and ticket machine problems. However the engine problems have been rectified and \\"Customer Service Hosts\\" have been employed who will issue tickets to passengers. Also unlike York where the 4 service was converted to ftr vehicle operation within a day. First decided to drip feed the ftr vehicles onto the service so passengers could get used to it and also minimise all other troubles that occurred in York. The ftr are based on Wright StreetCar body which is on a Volvo B7LA chassis, but the chassis on the StreetCars are different from the conventional B7LA, with no \\"closet\\" at the rear of vehicle. The livery is designed by Ray Stenning's Best Impressions design agency. LeedsCityBus First West Yorkshire ran the FreeCityBus service in the city of Bradford and currently run the LeedsCityBus service in Leeds, providing links between the bus and rail stations, shops and universities. The Bradford FreeCityBus has since been transferred to Ladies Only Travel. HolmfirthCONNECTION From 29 October 2006, buses running between Huddersfield and Holmfirth were re-branded as part of the HolmfirthCONNECTION. This was a service that was run in partnership with First Calderdale & Huddersfield and First TransPennine Express. It was designed to provide a direct bus to train link for passengers travelling from the Holme Valley on the bus to Huddersfield railway station to connect with trains to Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester on First TransPennine Express services. Buses 309-316 had their timetables changed and their terminus in Huddersfield moved from the bus station (buses still serve the bus station on journeys towards Holmfirth) to the railway station. The timetable changed to co-ordinate with the trains and included the introduction of a couple of late night journeys between Huddersfield and Holmfirth running after midnight. These service are currently the 314 and X10. Passengers are able to buy tickets on the bus as normal when travelling between the Holme Valley and Huddersfield but were also able to buy tickets on the bus for their train journey as well. The tickets can be bought to be used on the day or for a week. The weekly ticket provides unlimited travel for that week on First buses in the Calderdale and Kirklees areas and on the trains from Huddersfield to Leeds, Dewsbury or Manchester. The offer is an attractive one for people living in the Holme Valley as Holmfirth doesn't have a railway station anymore and their connections to the trains at Huddersfield railway station is made easier as passengers are able to walk off the bus, into the station and onto the train without having to queue up for another ticket. This offer is that train travel is restricted to First TransPennine Express services and is not valid on any Northern Rail train running along the same routes. The other is that the offer is only available for passengers travelling from the Holme Valley and is not available for people starting their journey on First TransPennine Express services from Dewsbury, Leeds or Manchester. In December 2007, First made several changes to its HolmfirthCONNECTION services, withdrawing the 309, 310 and 311 services, extending the daytime 312 service and the 314 service to Holme, extending the 316 service to Parkhead and re-routing the 313 service via Thongsbridge to Holmfirth before continuing to Hepworth. Three express services were introduced, the X10 from Holme to Huddersfield, plus 1 journey each on the X13 from Hepworth to Huddersfield and the X16 from Parkhead to Huddersfield. HolmfirthCONNECTION services underwent changes again in July 2008, with the Monday-Saturday daytime service on service 312 and all journeys on service 315 withdrawn and replaced by new service 308. More changes took place in April 2009, with the 308 terminating at Holmfirth instead of Parkhead, the 314 re- routed between Holmfirth and Holme, the 316 serving Parkhead instead of Holme and the X10 and X16 services replaced by a new X11 service, while in July 2009, all 313A journeys were re-numbered 313. MelthamCONNECTION From 27 July 2008, buses running between Huddersfield, Netherton, Marten Nest and Meltham are to be re-branded as part of the MelthamCONNECTION. It is based on the HolmfirthCONNECTION services that was introduced in 2006 to services running between the Holme Valley and Huddersfield. It is designed to provide a direct bus to train link for passengers travelling from Meltham, Marten Nest and Netherton on the bus to Huddersfield railway station to connect with trains to Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester on TransPennine Express services. Buses 321, 323 and 324 will have their timetables changed but unlike the HolmfirthCONNECTION, their terminus in Huddersfield will stay at the bus station and not serve the railway station in Huddersfield. Passengers are able to buy tickets on the bus as normal when travelling to Huddersfield but were also able to buy tickets on the bus for their train journey as well. The tickets can be bought to be used on the day or for a week. The weekly ticket provides unlimited travel for that week on First buses in the Calderdale and Kirklees areas and on the trains from Huddersfield to Leeds, Dewsbury or Manchester. The offer is an attractive one for people living in the Meltham and Netherton areas as they don't have a railway station and their connections to the trains at Huddersfield railway station is made easier as passengers are able to walk off the bus, into the rail station and onto the train without having to queue up for another ticket. ==Fleet== As of February 2014, First bus West Yorkshire has a total of 916 buses, which consists of 505 double deckers and 411 single deckers. ==Depots== First West Yorkshire operate five depots in Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hunslet and Bramley.FirstGroup Fleetlist Steve White ==Bradford Guided Busway== Bradford's Manchester Road Quality Bus Initiative is a £12m ground breaking project developed and funded by a public & private sector partnership consisting of Bradford Council, Metro -with the benefit of Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) funding through the local Transport Plan and First who also invested £1m in the scheme's infrastructure. Extending along 2.3 miles of one of the city's main arteries the initiative aims to deliver significant improvements to Public Transport in the South Bradford area and ease congestion on the city's main southern approach. The initiative includes 1.4 miles of guided busway & 1,320 yards of dedicated bus lanes. The work to create the guideway took over a year to complete The combination of bus-only guideways, dedicated bus lanes, modern bus stops and shelters, and a fleet of modern, low floor buses specially adapted to run in the guideways, will mean passengers can enjoy more reliable services, improved surroundings, better ride quality and quicker journey times. The Manchester Road scheme consists of a combination of Guided Busways and Bus Lanes together with pedestrian and cycling facilities. The inbound section of Bus Lane run from Croft Street to Bowling Old Lane and Mayo Avenue to Odsal Top and the outbound guideway runs from Bowling Old Lane to Mayo Avenue. The points where buses leave these facilities to enter into the general traffic on the approach to junctions are controlled by traffic signals. Measures improving bus stops, shelters, lighting and information about bus services are part of the development. First are committed to providing modern buses on the corridor, which will give them priority to bypass congestion and minimise delays often experienced at junctions. ==See also== *List of bus operators of the United Kingdom ==ReferencesExternal links== *First in Bradford *First in Calderdale & Huddersfield *First in Leeds Category:First Group bus operators in England Category:Bus operators in West Yorkshire ","title":"First West Yorkshire"},{"id":"12355994","text":"Polícia do Exército () may refer to: A type of Military Police: *Army Police (Brazil) *Army Police (Portugal) ==See also== * Military Police ","title":"Polícia do Exército"},{"id":"12356000","text":"A Finnish soldier with a captured ROKS-3 flamethrower, June 1943 The ROKS-2 and ROKS-3 were man-portable flamethrowers used by the USSR in the Second World War.

In 1895 the West Bronx already had many streets; the east had few The East Bronx is the part of the New York City borough of the Bronx which lies east of the Bronx River; this roughly corresponds to the eastern half of the borough. Neighborhoods include: Baychester, Castle Hill, City Island, Co- op City, Country Club, Eastchester, Edenwald, Edgewater Park, Harding Park, Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, Pelham Parkway, Soundview, Throggs Neck, Van Nest, Wakefield, Westchester Square, and Williamsbridge. The East Bronx is less densely populated than the West Bronx. While the West Bronx is older and very hilly, the East Bronx is not only later-settled but also very flat and coastal, much like the neighboring borough of Queens. The East Bronx was annexed by the City of New York decades later; the West Bronx in 1874, while the East Bronx remained part of Westchester County until 1895.Macy Jr., Harry. Before the Five-Borough City: The Old Cities, Towns and Villages That Came Together to Form “Greater New York”, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society from The NYG&B; Newsletter, Winter 1998, accessed April 29, 2007. “In 1683, when the Province of New York was first divided into counties, the City of New York also became New York County... In 1874, to accommodate this growth, New York City and County annexed from Westchester County what is now the western Bronx... In 1895 New York City annexed the eastern Bronx”. Unlike the West Bronx, the East Bronx has numbered streets in only a few neighborhoods. Because the Bronx uses the same street numbering system as Manhattan, streets designated as \\"east\\" (e.g., East 161st Street) may actually be located west of the Bronx River. This is because the east-west divider is Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and Jerome Avenue in the Bronx (which is directly north of Fifth Avenue), and only a relatively small area of the Bronx west lies of Jerome Avenue. Thus while all numbered streets in the East Bronx are necessarily designated \\"east\\", an \\"east\\" street designation does not automatically mean that the area in question is part of the East Bronx. The East Bronx has historically had a large Italian American population, and they still make up the biggest group in the neighborhoods of City Island, Country Club, Morris Park, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens and Throggs Neck. The Northeast Bronx has a large Afro-Caribbean population, in particular in the neighborhoods of Baychester, Edenwald and Wakefield. Parkchester is home to a large Asian American population (including Bengalis, Pakistanis, and Chinese), although the Asian population at 13% is far surpassed by the Hispanic population, mostly Puerto Ricans. Throughout the East Bronx, Hispanic Americans—of Puerto Rican and Dominican heritage—can be found and they are majority populations in Castle Hill, Parkchester, Soundview, Van Nest and Westchester Square. Albanians are a presence throughout the East Bronx, in particular in Morris Park, Pelham Parkway and Van Nest. The differences between the East and West Bronx go largely neglected today. Prior to the 1970s, New Yorkers generally saw the Bronx as being split into its eastern and western halves. With the urban decay that hit the southwestern Bronx starting in the 1960s, this traditional division received less attention. People began to see the borough as being fundamentally divided between the southwestern area (“The South Bronx”) and everywhere else. This notion became less relevant in the 21st century as crime, poverty and urban decay declined from their peaks in the late 1970s. ==ReferencesExternal links== * East Bronx History Forum Category:Neighborhoods in the Bronx ","title":"East Bronx"},{"id":"12356068","text":"Dr. Marion Blank is the creator of the Reading Kingdom reading program and the director of the A Light on Literacy program at Columbia University in New York. She is a developmental psychologist with a specialization in language and learning who has spent over forty years studying how children learn language, in both its spoken and written forms. She has lectured extensively around the world, served as a consultant to government bureaus in many different countries, and authored scores of peer-reviewed articles and books. Dr. Blank has developed a unique and comprehensive model for teaching reading that is based on six critical skills. Two are physical skills: the visual sequencing skills for reading the fine motor performance for writing and four are language skills: phonology, semantics, syntax and discourse. This model allows reading to be taught to a wide variety of children, including those for whom reading attainment is highly problematic such as non-verbal autistic children. Her latest books The Reading Remedy and Spectacular Bond and her latest program, the Reading Kingdom, are designed to make her system easily available to parents so that they may prevent or overcome the reading failure that afflicts about 40% of the school population across the nation. ==Education== Blank has her bachelor's degree from the City University of New York. She also has a master's degree in education from that institution. She has a Masters of Public Health degree from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. ==Career== Dr. Blank is currently on the faculty of the Department of Child Psychiatry at Columbia University where she created the Light on Literacy program.

B. White. It chronicles his pilgrimage back to a lakefront resort, Belgrade Lakes, Maine, that he visited as a child. In \\"Once More to the Lake,\\" White revisits his ideal boyhood vacation spot. While he initially finds great joy in his visit, the nostalgia causes him to struggle to remember that he is now a man, as he grapples with his own mortality. ==Background== White wrote a short pamphlet about the lake in 1914, at the age of 15. A second draft of the essay was a letter White wrote to his brother Stanley in the summer of 1936, when he had returned to the lake alone. In 1941, he brought his son Joel, the experience of which is recorded in \\"Once More to the Lake\\". ==Interpretations== The essay shows White engaging in an internal struggle between acting and viewing the lake as he did when he was a boy and acting and viewing it as an adult, or as his father would have. Although White sees the lake as having remained nearly identical to the lake of his boyhood, technology bars his experience and the new, noisier boats disturb the serene atmosphere at the lake. This could suggest that technology is impure or damaging, except that the same paragraph contains a lengthy reminiscence in which White rhapsodizes about his boyhood affection for an old one-cylinder engine. The memory balances the theme of technology, suggesting that certain kinds of technology, if a person can \\"get close to it spiritually,\\" are able to become almost a natural part of one's self. The author compares the time he went fishing with his dad and how he's fishing now with his son: He suddenly realizes how death is so close, because he is now the father and not the son. White references this in the final lines: White realizes that although human lives are by themselves transient and insignificant, experiences are immortal. In spite of the increasing amounts of technology, his son still has the same experiences that he had when he was a boy – sneaking out in the morning, being amused by the dragonflies. White releases his ego by realizing that he himself is inconsequential. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources *Angell, Roger. The Making of E. B. White.\\" *Baker, Russell. Growing Up.

Broten has also proposed caps on classrooms sizes and an increase in the number of educational assistants and pushed for economic reforms including a new procurement policy, and moving away from P3 deals, which he says costs more and ships benefits to other jurisdictions. Broten supports responsible resource development in Saskatchewan. Broten has also put a spotlight on the governing Saskatchewan Party's conversion to John Black Lean. In his time as opposition leader, Broten has been seen as productive, with moves like convincing the majority government to support his landmark private member's bill to create an asbestos registry for the province \\\\- known as Howard's Law - as well as measures to support local business and convincing the government to change its long- standing policy on Canada's Senate. Broten has consistently supported abolishment of Canada's upper chamber. 2016 election The NDP under Broten was defeated in the 2016 provincial election in which Brad Wall and the Saskatchewan Party was elected to a third successive majority government. The NDP under Broten won 10 seats, a gain of one seat from the previous election, to the Saskatchewan Party's 51 seats.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/saskatchewan-party-projected- to-win-majority-government-1.3520642 In the 2016 election Broten ran in Saskatoon Westview, a reconfigured version of his old riding, and lost to Saskatchewan Party candidate David Buckingham by 232 votes. Broten resigned as party leader on April 11, 2016. He thus became only the second Saskatchewan CCF/NDP leader since before World War II to have never served as premier. ==Personal life== On August 1, 2004 in Swift Current, Saskatchewan, Broten married Ruth Megan Eliason, a music therapist with Palliative Care Services in the Saskatoon Health Region who was raised on a family farm in the Stewart Valley area near Swift Current. His wife decided to keep her maiden name.Facebook They live in Saskatoon with their four daughters.

He criticized the documentation, user interface, unrealistic unit strength, and lack of options such as military intelligence, logistics, or most close air support. The reviewer stated that Patriot was \\"the first civilian wargame ever published which could be used immediately in the military for a CPX (Command Post Exercise). And this is part of the problem\\"; while with many novel features, he wrote; \\"the lack of a meaningful game dooms the remainder to oblivion\\". When evaluating version 1.10 of Patriot in December 1993, the same reviewer noted improvements in the documentation, stability, and user interface. He stated that \\"this was a wargame straight out of Command & General Staff College or the War College. In fact, this remains Patriots greatest strength and failure — it is simply too military. There is no feeling of action or vicarious thrill/terror ... it often is not fun\\". The reviewer recommended that \\"casual gamers\\" avoid it, advised that the game be \\"marketed to the defense establishment as a serious tool for decision-making\\", and suggested that it might assist students in military staff colleges with coursework.

It was advertised as the first Cartoon Network original series in its genre, and is based on the network’s 2006 movie Re-Animated. The series was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Brookwell McNamara Entertainment (the latter known for shows such as Even Stevens and That's So Raven). It was created by Tim McKeon and Adam Pava, who were originally the writers for Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, as well as the creators of Weighty Decisions short on Cartoon Network's Sunday Pants anthology series. The series premiered on Cartoon Network on September 14, 2007, to coincide with the release of the Re-Animated movie on DVD, and was the only network show to be affected by the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike. Then made its Canadian premiere on Teletoon on Saturday, September 6, 2008. It also aired on Boomerang in Australia. The U.S. run of the show ended with the airing of the show's final episode on May 29, 2008. Cartoon Network did not acknowledge the series again until 2018, where Golly had a cameo role in the OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes crossover special \\"Crossover Nexus,\\" alongside a small cameo with Dolly in the 20th-anniversary mural from 2012. ==Premise== The series follows the back-story established by the film. After receiving a brain transplant from a celebrated cartoonist following an accident, 13-year-old Jimmy Roberts finds himself inexplicably capable of seeing and communicating with the famed animated characters created by the cartoonist, resulting in a variety of odd predicaments or situations at the hands of Jimmy's interactions with these hallucinations. However, he also must handle the deceased cartoonist's conspiring and scheming son, Sonny Appleday, with intentions of murdering Jimmy and obtaining his father's brain so he may gain notoriety as a cartoonist, and take over the world. ==Cast== Main * Dominic Janes as Jimmy Roberts * Tinashe Kachingwe as Robin Wheeler * Bil Dwyer as Ken Roberts * Jon Kent Ethridge II as Craig Wheeler * Rhea Lando as Yancy Roberts * Matt Knudsen as Sonny Appleday * Carlos Alazraqui as voice of Golly Gopher * Ellen Greene as voice of Dolly Gopher * Tom Kenny as voice of Tux the Penguin * Brian Posehn as voice of Crocco the Alligator Recurring * Rachel Quaintance as Louisa Roberts * Jonina Gable as Becky * Christian Vandal as Logan * Austin Rogers as Animal Loving Kevin * Terrence Hardy, Jr. as Easily Excited Kid * Caden Michael Gray as Crazy Jake * Katelin Petersen as Hildy Jeffries * Nicole Smolen as Young Yancy * Nolan Gould as Young Jimmy * Ryan Eggold as Mike Werewolfowitz ==Episodes== Pilot film (2006) Season 1 (2007–08) ==Broadcast and reception== For Out of Jimmy's Head, Cartoon Network ordered 20 episodes, which were filmed from May to September 2007. In airing the show, Cartoon Network split the series into two seasons. The first season of the show premiered in September 2007 and lasted 13 episodes. The channel later aired the remaining seven episodes as the second season, starting in March 2008, one week after the airing of episode 13, which was considered part of the first season. The show's hiatus between seasons (actually between episodes 12 and 13) coincided with the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, which led many to believe that writing on the show had been interrupted. In fact, writing and production for all episodes had been completed in September. However, the strike did prevent the writers from being involved in editing and post-production, including the controversial decision to add a laugh track beginning with episode 8, \\"Skate Night\\". Following the strike, the series was not renewed. It was the last Cartoon Network original series to be broadcast in full screen 4:3 before Cartoon Network started its own high-definition feed, although it was produced in a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \\"Cast aside all that clutter, though, and this is really just another show about a seventh grader trying to fit in. It’s also a show with a sly sense of humor when it’s not being self-consciously frentic\\", and praised Bil Dwyer for his comedic role.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/arts/television/14jimm.html?_r=0 Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media rated the show 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: \\"It's just fun fluff. It is worth noting that the show is an improvement on the movie in terms of Jimmy's increased confidence and ability to fend off peer pressure, which is certainly a welcome change\\".https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/out-of-jimmys-head# Despite the negative reviews from critics and audience, it had some accolades: the program's cast won a combined Young Artist Award in 2008 for \\"Best Young Ensemble Performance in a TV Series\\"., then was nominated at the same ceremony for \\"Best Family Television Series\\", and finally Tinashe Kachingwe with Caden Michael Gray were nominated for \\"Best Performance in a TV Series - Supporting Young Actress\\" and \\"Best Performance in a TV Series - Recurring Young Actor\\", respectively. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:2007 American television series debuts Category:2008 American television series endings Category:2000s American animated television series Category:2000s American teen sitcoms Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American flash animated television series Category:American television series with live action and animation Category:Cartoon Network original programming Category:Cartoon Network Studios series Category:Cryonics in fiction Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series about teenagers Category:Television series by Brookwell McNamara Entertainment ","title":"Out of Jimmy's Head"},{"id":"12356185","text":"Lysostaphin (, glycyl-glycine endopeptidase) is a Staphylococcus simulans metalloendopeptidase (crystal structure of lysostaphin). It can function as an antimicrobial against Staphylococcus aureus. Lysostaphin is a 27 KDa glycylglycine endopeptidase, an antibacterial enzyme which is capable of cleaving the crosslinking pentaglycine bridges found in the cell wall peptidoglycan of certain Staphylococci. Lysostaphin was first isolated from a culture of Staphylococcus simulans by Schindler and Schuhardt in 1964. S. aureus cell walls contain high proportions of pentaglycine, making lysostaphin a highly effective agent against both actively growing and quiescent bacteria. Staphylococcal infections of both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis continue to be a major issue in clinical settings, particularly those with implantable devices. Staphylococci cause a significant percentage of device infections, and like many other pathogens, rather than living as free planktonic cells within the host they have the ability to form a multilayered community of sessile bacteria cells known as a biofilm on implantable devices. Once a \\"Staphylococcal\\" biofilm has formed on an implanted medical device, it is difficult to disrupt due to its antibiotic resistance and protection against bacterial action. Many studies have been previously published on lysostaphin since its isolation, both in vitro and in vivo. Lysostaphin has been shown to eradicate susceptible S. aureus biofilms. It has also been reported to be effective in disrupting S. epidermidis biofilms in vitro, albeit at higher concentrations of the enzyme. Compared to commonly used antibiotics such as vancomycin, lysostaphin has been shown to demonstrate greater antibacterial activity in vitro. The enzyme has demonstrated effectiveness against methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) mediated keratitis in vivo in a rabbit model. Additionally, it has been shown that lysostaphin combined with antimicrobials such as cefazolin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, linezolid and quinuprisitin/dalfopristin has a synergistic effect for MSSA strains of the bacteria. A study published by Belyansky et al. illustrated that a lysostaphin bound mesh demonstrated dramatic preservation results in a rat model. Using lyostaphin to treat \\"Staphylococcal\\" biofilm associated infections may prove to be preferable to using antibiotics as it may be possible to administer the enzyme at relatively low doses and disrupt a staphylococcal bioflim, therefore eliminating the need for surgical removal of the infected device. == References  External links == * The MEROPS online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: M23.004 * * Category:EC 3.4.24 Category:Bacteriocins ","title":"Lysostaphin"},{"id":"12356198","text":"David Bostice (born April 3, 1972, in Los Angeles, California) is an American heavyweight boxer.

He was the son of a painter and decorator from Clifton Street in west Belfast. Of his seven brothers, four, Albert (1863–1927), Jack (1872–1926), Edwin (1877–1952) and Norman (1879–1917), were also illustrators and cartoonists. Educated at the Model School and the Government School of Art, he was apprenticed as a signwriter. He contributed to an exhibition by the Belfast Ramblers' Sketching Club in 1888, and later studied in Paris. In the mid to late 1890s he lived in Chelsea, London, where he made the acquaintance of Mark Twain. In 1896 he contributed illustrations to Pick-Me-Up and Mary Russell Mitford's County Stories. He contributed to Ulad, a magazine associated with the Ulster Literary Theatre, in 1905. In 1906 he sat on the committee of the first Oireachtas Art Exhibition with Jack Butler Yeats and Sarah Purser, contributed cartoons to The Shanachie and Bulmer Hobson's separatist magazine The Republic, and began his long association with Punch. Over the years he contributed 2,704 cartoons, including 22 full-page political cartoons. He joined the staff of the magazine in 1924, and was art editor from 1932 to 1937. For many years, Morrow produced \\"Royal Academy Depressions\\", a series of comic parodies of Royal Academy pictures. Other publications he contributed to included the Bystander, The Pall Mall Magazine, Sphere, Strand Magazine, Tatler and Windsor Magazine. Several collections of his cartoons were published. An Alphabet of the War (1915) reprinted cartoons from Punch Almanack. George Morrow: His Book (1920), More Morrow (1921) and Some More (1928) followed. He also illustrated more than 70 books by other authors for adults and children, and created the satirical pictorial novel What a Life! with E. V. Lucas. He lived most of his adult life in England, although he spent many summers painting watercolours in Ireland, particularly in County Donegal. Married with no children, he died at his home in Thaxted, Essex, about a month after his last cartoon appeared in Punch. ==Partial bibliography== *Change for a Halfpenny (1905) (online version) *The Game of Ju-Jitsu (1906), by Taro Miyake and Yukio Tani *What a Life!

Although he went to acting school, he had better success as a cabaret singer. In 1924 as his career was picking up he changed his surname to Vig. He changed his name because Voglhut was a Jewish-sounding name and antisemitism was growing at the time. Vig means cheerful or merry; it is a nice, short, typically Hungarian name that also made a great stage name. Family Other musicians from the Vig family include saxophone and clarinet player György Vig (brother) and jazz musician Tommy Vig (nephew).All About Jazz A nephew of Miklós Vig, Dr. John R. Vig, was president of the IEEE in 2009. Murder The fact that he was married to a Catholic woman, Kató Szőke, and the fact that he changed his name did not save him from the Holocaust.

Although he made many recordings, he became most famous as a singer of popular music on the radio.

The competition started on February 10 and the final was played on May 31. Only the clubs participants of the Supreme and First Leagues competed this season. It was the first National Cup edition replacing the previous competition of the Ukrainian SSR Cup, which was organized as a regional qualification competition for the Soviet Cup. The last winner of that Soviet competition FC Temp Shepetivka was eliminated in the first preliminary round by Kremin Kremenchuk. Simultaneously, three of the participating Ukrainian clubs were still competing in the Soviet Cup. The first trophy was won by Chornomorets Odessa thus qualifying to the qualification round of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. ==Organization== It was decided that the Cup would start with 16 teams and six Soviet Top League participants would gain direct qualification, while the other 10 teams had to qualify through couple of preliminaries with Azovets Mariupol gaining bye round. Forty-five teams participated in the first Cup with 19 pairs in the first preliminary round and 10 in the second. The winner of the competition gained a chance to qualify for the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup competition. The preliminary rounds and the final consisted of only one game while the other three had a home-away fixture scheduled. ;Participating teams * 1992 Ukrainian Premier League (20) * 1992 Ukrainian First League (25) (except for the second teams) Distribution {  - !colspan=2 !Teams entering in this round !Teams advancing from previous round - !colspan=2First qualifying round (38 teams)  * 14 participants of the Supreme League * 24 participants of the First League  - !colspan=2Second qualifying round (20 teams)  * 1 participant of the First League (Azovets Mariupol)  * 19 winners from the first qualifying round - !colspan=2Tournament proper (16 teams)  * 6 participants of the Supreme League  * 10 winners from the second qualifying round } Brief overview The tournament started on February 10, 1992, with the game between Podillia Khmelnytsky and Bukovyna Chernivtsi right in the middle of the Zakarpattia Oblast in the village of Ilnytsia and culminated in the final game in Kiev on May 31, 1992. With the organization of the Ukrainian Cup competition the three Ukrainian clubs Dynamo Kyiv, Chornomorets Odessa, and Metalist Kharkiv that still were in competition of the Soviet Cup with their Quarterfinals games scheduled on March 25, 1992, had those fixtures canceled, abandoning that competition. The highest attending game happened to be in the Round of 16 when FC Skala Stryi were playing against FC Dynamo Kyiv in the city of Stryi in front of 17,000 spectators. Skala lost that game in the overtime by the goal from Oleg Salenko. Even the final game attendance of 12,000 could not beat that festival of sport in the small city of the Lviv Oblast. The lowest attendance of the competition was in the game between Kolos Nikopol and Polissia Zhytomyr which took place on February 16, 1992, just outside the city of Nikopol in Chkalove village and was witnessed only by 150 people. The highest scoring game took place in Odessa when the local Chornomorets avenged its poor performance in Zhytomyr by beating Polissia 7:1. The biggest margin in goals scored was recorded in Zaporizhia when the local Metalurh won over Vahonobudivnyk 7:0. The most surprising was the elimination of the Soviet Cup participant Dynamo Kyiv that lost its quarterfinal stand off against the Zaporizhian Automakers 1:2 in aggregate. ==Competition schedule== First preliminary round All games took place on February 16, 1992, except the game in Zakarpattia between Podillia - Bukovyna which took place on February 10, 1992. All 39 clubs out 45 took part in this round. The other six clubs, participants of the Soviet Top League, received bye for the next two rounds to the Round of 16. The 39 clubs played off for another 10 passes. { style=\\"width:100%;\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" - !width=20% !width=12% !width=20% ! - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Коlоs\\"(Nikopil) (1L) align=center1:2  (1L) \\"Polissya\\"(Zhytomyr) in village of Chkalove (Nikopol Raion) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Stal\\"(Alchevsk) (1L) align=center2:1  (1L) \\"Zakarpattya\\"(Uzhhorod) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Vahonobudivnyk\\"(Stakhanov) (1L) align=center1:1  (1L) \\"Khimik\\"(Siverodonetsk)  aet, pk 4:3 - style=font- size:90% align=right \\"Avtomobilist\\"(Sumy) (1L) align=center1:0  (PL) \\"Nyva\\"(Ternopil) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Volyn\\"(Lutsk) (PL) align=center2:3  (PL) \\"Torpedo\\"(Zaporizhia) village of Dachne (Kivertsi Raion) - style=font-size:90% align=right SCA Odessa (PL) align=center1:1  (PL) \\"Sudobudivnyk\\"(Mykolaiv)  aet, pk 5:4 - style=font-size:90% align=right SKA(Kiev) (1L) align=center1:2  (1L) \\"Kryvbas\\"(Kryvyi Rih)  aet - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Vorskla\\"(Poltava) (1L) align=center1:0  (1L) \\"Desna\\"(Chernihiv) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Artania\\"(Ochakiv) (1L) align=center1:3  (PL) \\"Zoria- MALS\\"(Luhansk) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Skala\\"(Stryi) (1L) align=center1:0  (PL) \\"Nyva\\"(Vinnytsia)  aet - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Karpaty\\"(Lviv) (PL) align=center1:0  (1L) \\"Ros\\"(Bila Tserkva) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Dnipro\\"(Cherkasy) (1L) align=center1:0  (1L) \\"Veres\\"(Rivne) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Podillya\\"(Khmelnytskyi) (1L) align=center1:1  (PL) \\"Bukovyna\\"(Chernivtsi)  aet, pk 1:3 in village of Ilnytsia (Irshava Raion) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Krystal\\"(Chortkiv) (1L) align=center2:0  (1L) \\"Prykladnyk\\"(Mukachevo) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Shakhtar\\"(Pavlohrad) (1L) align=center2:1  (1L) \\"Krystal\\"(Kherson) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Halychyna\\"(Drohobych) (1L) align=center0:2  (PL) \\"Naftovyk\\"(Okhtyrka) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Chaika\\"(Sevastopol) (1L) align=center0:2  (PL) \\"Tavria\\"(Simferopol) in Alushta - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Теmp\\"(Shepetivka) (PL) align=center1:2  (PL) \\"Kremin\\"(Kremenchuk) - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Polihraftekhnika\\"(Olexandria) (1L) align=center0:0  (PL) \\"Prykarpattya\\"(Ivano-Frankivsk)  aet, pk 4:3 - style=font-size:90% align=right \\"Azovets\\"(Mariupol) (1L) align=centerbye } Second preliminary round Most of games took place on February 23, 1992.

Located on the North Shore of the Saint Lawrence River, about from downtown Trois-Rivières, the parish of Saint- Narcisse is the heart of the Mauricie region. ==Geography== With an area of , the city territory is divided by rows: Grande Ligne (Great line), the second highest rank Saint-Felix, row Sainte-Marguerite and row \\"Du Barrage\\" (row of the Dam). The territory also includes the \\"lake Morin\\" (popularly referred to as \\"Petit lac\\" - Little Lake) which is located north of the Grande Ligne (Great Line). A line of mountains crosses the municipal territory along its entire length, separating the plate of Middle Mauricie with the plain of the Lower Mauricie. Its watershed is mostly part of the Batiscanie, except the southwest area, the limit of Champlain and of Saint-Luc-de-Vincennes. The municipality is crossed by five rivers: Batiscan River, River des Chutes (River of the falls), Rivière-au-Lard (Bacon River), Rivière-aux-Fourches (River of the forks), and Rivière La Tortue (Turtle River). The route of the \\"Turtle River\\" enter into Saint-Narcisse by the northwest end (row \\"Côte St- Pierre - Northeast area\\"), where it crosses four lots on . Then the river continues to flow in Saint-Séverin to go jump into the Rivière des Envies (River cravings). Wetland A sector of wetland covering three municipalities, is located south-east of Lac-à-la-Tortue, head of water between the watershed of Lac-à-la-Tortue (including the outlet of Lake Atocas), the rivière à la Tortue (Turtle River) and \\"Rivière des chutes\\" (River des Chutes): # Row \\"Cote Saint-Pierre Coté Sud-Ouest\\", a few lands in the southeast of Hérouxville and a dozen lands of Saint-Narcisse; # Row \\"Cote Saint-Pierre Coté Northeast\\" in Saint-Narcisse, a few limited and isolated wetlands covering about 14 lots (near the road linking the Lac-à-la-Tortue and Saint-Narcisse); # Row X 's in Hérouxville, some isolated areas at the southeast of the row, spread on eight lots; # Row IX Lac-à-la-Tortue in Radnor Township, three lots (near the limit of Hérouxville); # Forefront of Radnor in Saint-Narcisse, north-east of the row, is the head area of the River des Chutes.Research done on Septembre 2013 by historian Gaétan Veillette (Saint- Hubert, QC), using maps published by Service de la cartographie du Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources, of Gouvernement du Québec. Maps dated as of: 1989-06-12. ==History== The first pioneer Louis Cosset, came from Sainte- Geneviève-de-Batiscan, was established in Saint-Narcisse about 1804. Among the other early settlers, many came from the neighboring parishes of St. Lawrence River. The settlement expansion forced the new pioneers to cross a moraine an estimated one kilometer wide.Luc Veillette, volume \\"Jos Noé Veillette et Aurore Cossette-Histoire et généalogie d'une famille d'entrepreneurs forestiers\\" (Jos Noah Veillette and Aurore Cossette-history and genealogy of a family of loggers), APLAB Edition, 2012, 247 pages, p. 11. This moraine path of the Mauricie, between Saint-Paulin at the west end and Saint-Raymond at the East end, is about 120 kilometers long. It is referred to as \\"Saint-Narcisse Moraine\\" because this moraine is more prominent at the height of Saint- Narcisse. This geological formation was shaped about 11,000 years ago, at the end of the last glacial period, with the deposition of various layers of rock at the foot of the gigantic glaciers.Marcel Trudel, \\"Saint-Narcisse-de- Champlain, au pays de Batiscan\\" (Saint-Narcisse-de-Champlain, in the country of Batiscan), Municipality of Saint-Narcisse, 2001, page 23. == Solidarity Fair (August) == From August 1982 until 2012, the community of Saint-Narcisse organized a festival that caters to the whole family. The \\"Fête de la Solidarité\\" (Solidarity Fair) was born during the economic downturn. While business people watching to consolidate the economic structure of the square, a group of young people organized the first Day of Solidarity. Their idea was to strengthen the social fabric of the city so that people have reason to celebrate despite the economic environment was difficult and they create links between them in order to overcome obstacles together. The Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in the summer of 2011. The programming of the festival included the solidarity between other musical performances, exhibitions and fireworks. A parade of fantastic night has already taken place during the festival, but this was abandoned activated for the 2008 edition because of volunteers. A park for children included games and entertainment organized. The town park gives out game shows organized for the benefit of children. The decision that the party no longer exists fell in early 2013, following a meeting with the population of the municipality. The lack of volunteers led to the end of the festival that brought new tourists every year for over 30 years. ==Industry== The town is known for the making of mattresses, prefabricated homes, and the sale of farm tractors. Catholic Church The architecture of the church of Saint-Narcisse transcends in a Gothic style. It was built from 1871 to 1874.

In 1916, the factory decided on a extension of the church building a new facade with two towers. The factory also allows the acquisition of a Casavant organ. The interior of the church is the work of the painter Monti. Dupont House Dupont House The Dupont House was built in 1871, adjacent to the church. This building has long served as a public meeting place for parishioners on Sundays, especially after church services celebrated in the church. This house of a classic 19th-century style is now owned by the municipality. The historical committee of the parish of Saint-Narcisse administers this historical house. The mission of the Dupont House has been transformed into an arts centre and exhibition hall. Hydroelectric plant on Batiscan River The hydroelectric power station of Saint-Narcisse was built between 1895 and 1897 to harness the great falls of the Batiscan River. This plant helped build the first high voltage line of the British Empire and it linked Saint-Narcisse to Trois-Rivières. Electricity Saint-Narcisse fed the electrical distribution system of the city of Trois-Rivières, including street lighting. From the village of Saint-Narcisse, visitors access to the barrage of Batiscan River using the Route 361 on about , then just follow road signs of Hydro-Quebec.

Swell is a function of the number of sections in the book, the kind of paper used, the style of sewing, and the thickness of the sewing thread. Human factors also influence swell, especially the force with which the bookbinder \\"bones down\\", or flattens, each section after sewing. Prior to the 15th century, swell in textblocks was accommodated, if at all, by shaping the wooden boards that formed a book's covers. The inner surface of each board would be lightly tapered along the spine edge, so that the removed wood created a space for the thicker paper along the sewn folds. By the 15th century, though, the process of rounding and backing became common, and books were given their characteristic rounded spines and shoulders. This mushroom-like shape compensates for the swell of the book by using the extra thickness to create an extra surface against which the boards of the book can rest. Flat backs, or books without a curved spines, should ideally have no swell. Books with rounded backs, or curved spines, however, require swell. Too little swell results in insufficient backing, and the book will lack proper shoulders. Too much swell, however, causes the spine to become over-round, and can create a propensity among the middle sections of the book to collapse inwards, falling toward the fore edge.

It was produced by Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor, and released on 3 August 2007. The film explores the troubled relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Harilal Gandhi. ==Background== The movie is based upon the biography of Harilal Gandhi, titled Harilal Gandhi: A Life by Chandulal Bhagubhai Dalal. Khan's play, Mahatma vs. Gandhi, while different from this film, had a similar theme which was based on novel by Gujarati author Dinkar Joshi. The movie was shot in South Africa and in several Indian cities including Mumbai and Ahmedabad. ==Plot== Gandhi My Father paints the picture of Gandhi's intricate, complex and strained relationship with his son Harilal Gandhi. From the onset, the two had dreams in opposite directions. Harilal's ambition was to study abroad and become a barrister like his father, while Gandhi hoped that his son would join him and fight for his ideals and causes in India. When Gandhi does not give Harilal the opportunity to study abroad, it comes as a blow to Harilal. He decides to abandon his father’s vision and leaves South Africa for India where he joins his wife Gulab (Bhumika Chawla) and children. He goes back to further his education to earn his diploma but continuously fails and ends in financial ruins. Various plans and schemes to make money fail, leaving the family in poverty. Sick of his failure, Gulab returns to her parents’ house with the children, where she eventually dies from the flu epidemic. Distraught, Harilal turns to alcohol for solace and converts to Islam, only to re-convert to a different sect of Hinduism later on. With political tension heating up, the rift between Gandhi and his eldest son grows until it is beyond repair. Harilal finds it unbearable to live in the enormous shadow of his father. Gandhi is assassinated before the two can reconcile and Harilal attends his father's funeral virtually as a stranger, almost unrecognizable to those around him. A short while later, he passes away, alone and in poverty, having failed to find his own identity. ==Cast== *Darshan Jariwala - Mahatma Gandhi *Akshaye Khanna - Harilal Gandhi *Bhumika Chawla - Gulab Gandhi *Shefali Shah - Kasturba Gandhi *Vinay Jain - Kanti Gandhi ==Awards== 2007 National Film Awards *Special Jury Award - Feroz Abbas Khan & Anil Kapoor *Best Screenplay - Feroz Abbas Khan *Best Supporting Actor - Darshan Jariwala 2008 Zee Cine Awards *Critics Award (Best Film) - Anil Kapoor *Critics Award (Best Actress) - Shefali Shah 2007 Asia Pacific Screen Awards *Best Screenplay - Feroz Abbas Khan ==See also== *List of artistic depictions of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ==NotesExternal links== * *BollySpice's Gandhi My Father movie review *Official Website of Hindi Movie Gandhi my Father at Eros Entertainment * *Gandhi, My Father at Yahoo!

This municipality is part of the Les Chenaux Regional County Municipality in Batiscanie and in the administrative region of Mauricie. It is located along the Batiscan River. The town of Sainte-Geneviève-de-Batiscan was the seat of the Lordship of Batiscan from 1665 and Champlain County from 1855 to 1981. During the first centuries of its history, the economy of the area has been focused on forestry, agriculture, fishing and river transport. Sainte-Geneviève was also a prominent center of trade for the Batiscanie. ==Geography== The main village is situated on the northeast shore of the Batiscan River at the confluence of the Veillet River, while a small village is located just opposite, on the south-west. The village center is located about from the mouth of the Batiscan River and from the Batiscan railway station, on the former Canadian Pacific Railway line (now run in this area by Quebec Gatineau Railway). The Batiscan River through the village and splits into two parts. The agricultural area of Sainte-Geneviève- de-Batiscan stops at the foot of the Saint-Narcisse moraine. It is a mountainous line in the east-west direction, between Sainte-Geneviève-de- Batiscan with Saint-Stanislas and Saint-Narcisse. Throughout the territory of Sainte-Geneviève-de-Batiscan is included in the Batiscanie, but two areas: one in the east, at the limit of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, and the other to the southwest, near the limit of Saint-Luc-de-Vincennes. ==Toponymy== Initially, the Catholic parish was named in honour of Saint Genevieve, patron saint of France and the city of Paris, the largest French-speaking city in the world. In France, the French patron saint is also the Diocese of Nanterre and gendarmes. The name \\"Batiscan\\" was derived from the chief of the Algonquin people from around 1610 to 1629, for whom the river was named after. ==Catholic Parish== The civil records of Sainte-Genevieve de Batiscan start in July 1727 and are administered by the neighboring parish of Saint-François- Xavier-de-Batiscan up to the canonical erection of the Catholic parish of Sainte-Genevieve de Batiscan, which occurred on August 16, 1833. This Catholic parish falls within the Diocese of Trois-Rivières. A priest or a pastor serving resides since 1728. ==Municipality== The municipality of Sainte- Genevieve de Batiscan was erected May 11, 1841 in the southeastern part of the Lordship of Batiscan under the Act 8 Vict. chap. 40, in July 1845. The territory of municipality of Sainte-Geneviève was detached from the parishes of Saint-François-Xavier-de-Batiscan and La Visitation de Champlain.Magnan, Hormisdas, \\"Dictionnaire historique et géographique des paroisses, missions et municipalités de la Province de Québec\\" (Historical and Geographical Dictionary of parishes, missions and municipalities of the Province of Quebec), 1925, p. 402. ==Regional Administration== From 1855 to 1982, the city was the seat of Champlain County. In 1982, the old county system was reformulated into the new regional county municipality (RCM) system, with Sainte-Geneviève-de-Batiscan becoming part of the Francheville RCM. On December 31, 2001, it was transferred from the Francheville RCM to the new Les Chenaux RCM, following the creation of the new City of Trois-Rivières and the dissolution of the Francheville RCM. {align = center  View of Sainte- Geneviève-de-Batiscan from the opposite side of the Batiscan River } ==Notable people== *Jacques J.

The game is loosely based on the 1831 Victor Hugo novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame and the player controls Quasimodo. Set on top of a castle wall, the player must guide the Hunchback from left to right while avoiding obstacles on a series of non- scrolling screens. The goal of each screen is to ring the church bell at the far right. ==Gameplay== Arcade screenshot Obstacles include pits which must be swung over on a long rope, ramparts which must be jumped (some of which contain knights with spears) and flying fireballs and arrows (to be ducked or jumped). To impose a time limit on each screen a knight climbs the wall, costing the player a life should he reach the top. Eventually, after completing a number of screens, the player must rescue Esmeralda. If this final screen is completed, the game begins again at a faster speed. ==Development== The hunchback character was originally to be Robin Hood, hence the green costume and the game stages with arrows. The artist who drew the Robin Hood character left the company before the decision to change the theme to Hunchback. By the time a new artist was taken on, the green costume had become accepted and no-one questioned it (someone commented that the Robin Hood character, as drawn, looked like a hunchback). ==Ports== Ports were released in 1984 by Ocean Software for the Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, VIC-20, Dragon 32, Oric, and ZX Spectrum.

It is transmitted between plants by insect vectors such as the groundnut aphid (Aphis craccivora). ==History== The groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) originated in South America where it has long been domesticated. More recently it has been cultivated in other parts of the world and is an important subsistence crop in Sub-Saharan Africa. Groundnut rosette virus was first described in Africa in 1907 and causes serious damage to groundnut crops on that continent. In 1939 it was reported to infect 80 to 90% of plants in the Belgian Congo causing major losses in yield. The virus can spread rapidly through a crop. In a study in Tanzania, the first affected plants were seen six days after the first aphids were observed. Aphid numbers built up rapidly and the disease increased tenfold in two weeks with 65% of the crop plants affected three weeks later. ==Symptoms== Research has shown that plants infected by groundnut rosette virus alone show little or no effect, but that the symptoms of the disease are caused by a satellite RNA co-infection, a subviral agent. Groundnut plants affected take on a bushy appearance due to stunting and distortion of the growing shoots. There is a yellowing or mottling of the foliage. Plants affected when young may produce no nuts. There are three main types of symptoms: *Chlorotic rosette is common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Young leaflets become slightly mottled, and older leaflets become chlorotic with green veins. In young plants the leaves become increasingly yellow, twisted and stunted, but in older plants a few branches or just the growing point may be affected. *Mosaic rosette is prevalent in East and Central Africa. Young leaves have a green and yellow mosaic appearance and later symptoms resemble those of chlorotic rosette but the plants are less severely stunted. *Green rosette is known from West Africa, northern Malawi, Uganda and possibly Angola. Younger leaves show some mottling and flecking while older leaves are small and very deep green and have inrolled margins. The plants are severely stunted and resemble plants infected with peanut clump virus. The chlorotic and green types are caused by two variants of the satellite RNA while the mosaic type is caused by infection with a mixture of both variants. Further research has shown that another virus, groundnut rosette assistor virus (GRAV), is also involved in infection. Some groundnut varieties that are resistant to rosette disease have been demonstrated to be highly resistant to GRV and its satellite RNA but fully susceptible to GRAV. ==Transmission== The main vector for groundnut rosette virus is the groundnut aphid (Aphis craccivora). When it sucks the sap of an infected plant it receives groundnut rosette virus and satellite RNA, packaged together within a coating of groundnut rosette assistor virus. The disease is epidemic in nature and there is a seasonal cycle of infection, but the origins of this virus are unknown. In Africa, the groundnut aphid feeds on as many as 142 different species of plant, many of them in the family Fabaceae, and the groundnut rosette virus is presumed to have originated among these. Research has shown that although other host plants exist for GRV, GRAV and satellite RNA individually, the only known natural host plant for all parts of the complex is the groundnut. Virus resistant varieties of groundnut have been discovered but mostly have a long growing period (five to six months rather than three to four for other varieties) and may therefore be more susceptible to drought. A breeding programme has been established in Malawi focussing on disease resistance, early maturity and high yield. == References  External links == * Family Groups—The Baltimore Method Category:Umbraviruses Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Peanut diseases ","title":"Groundnut rosette virus"},{"id":"12356476","text":"Standoff commonly refers to: *Impasse, two sides negotiating an agreement are unable to reach an agreement and become deadlocked *Stalemate, a situation in the game of chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move *Mexican standoff, a confrontation between three or more parties in which neither party can proceed nor retreat without being exposed to danger Standoff or stand-off may also refer to: == Media production == *Standoff (TV series), a 2006–2007 Fox Broadcasting television series *Stand Off, a 2012 film written and directed by Terry George (known as Whole Lotta Sole in Europe) *American Standoff, a 2002 American documentary about a strike *Standoff (film), a 2016 film *Standoff (Homeland), an episode of the television series Homeland == Weaponry == *Standoff missile, a type of missile or bomb released at a safe distance from the target which travels autonomously to the target *AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon, the product of a joint venture between the United States Navy and Air Force *Standoff Land Attack Missile == Sports == *Stand-off (rugby league), an English alternative name for five- eighth, one of the rugby league positions *Stand-off, an alternative name for fly-half, one of the rugby union positions == Other uses == *Standoff (separator), used in mechanics and electronics to separate two parts from one another *Standoff distance, a certain safe distance from a hazard or objective (live bomb, fire, artillery aimpoint, etc.), defined by a standard operating procedure *Stand Off, Alberta, Canada, unincorporated community *Standoff (draw) *Standoff (video game), a video game formerly known as Active Shooter ","title":"Standoff"},{"id":"12356480","text":"Nahapet Gevorgyan (; born June 28, 1957) was born in the village of Hoktember in the Hoktemberyan region in Armenia.

He started his football career at the cantera of local FC Barcelona, starting as a striker, then midfielder and finally defender. In the summer of 2002, Fernández joined FC Barcelona B, where he played during the next four years, always in the third division. In the 2004–05 pre-season he was invited to the first team by manager Frank Rijkaard, and appeared in friendlies with CD Banyoles, UE Figueres and Palamós CF, adding one official match on 15 November 2005, the Copa Catalunya semi- final against Gimnàstic de Tarragona. Ukrainian adventure After playing for Barcelona for 14 years, Fernández was ready for a new challenge. In June 2006, he signed a three-year deal with Ukrainian club FC Metalurh Donetsk. The defender followed former Barcelona player Jordi Cruyff and manager Pichi Alonso to Donetsk, and made his official debut on 19 August in the Premier League game against FC Shakhtar Donetsk (0–0). Due to disappointing results, Alonso was replaced by Dutch Co Adriaanse in December 2006, and Fernández was not a big fan of the new manager: \\"It was not easy to get along with him. It really took some time to get used to him.\\" In December 2007 Metalurh Donetsk found itself in a crisis, and decided to seize all operations with the club's vice president, Dmitry Selyuk; this led to the departure of almost all foreign players. Selyuk turned out to be the owner of various player's transfer rights, including Fernández's, and the former placed the latter at another Ukrainian team, FC Arsenal Kyiv. However, the player did not appear in a single match for them as both he and his wife were having a hard time adjusting to the country's lifestyle; after one and a half year, he requested a transfer. Holland On 17 January 2008, Fernández joined Eredivisie side N.E.C. Nijmegen on loan. Manager Mario Been had been tipped by former Feyenoord youth coach Henk van Stee, the manager of Shakhtar's youth academy; however, due to N.E.C.'s good performances after the winter break, the player had a hard time fighting himself into the first team, and only played four league games. Despite Fernández's position on the bench, Been was very satisfied with the progress the Spanish made. After the departure of starting right-back Muslu Nalbantoğlu to Kayserispor at the end of 2007–08, N.E.C. decided to offer him an extended loan deal for another season. He quickly became a first-team regular, appearing in 30 matches during the campaign. In early June 2009, Fernández followed former manager Been to Feyenoord, where he only played five games before suffering two serious knee injuries, which kept him off the pitch for nearly two years. ==International career== Fernández never played for the Spain national team.

The story was written by Jean Van Hamme. Its completion was delayed with the death of the artist, René Sterne, on 15 November 2006. The book was completed by Sterne's girlfriend Chantal de Spiegeleer and was released on 20 November 2009. It is a two-part installment containing \\"The Manuscript of Nicodemus\\" (Le manuscrit de Nicodemus) as part 1 and \\"The Gate of Orpheus\\" (La porte d'Orphée) as part 2. It tells of the search for the 30 pieces of silver paid to Judas Iscariot for his betrayal of Jesus. ==Plot== Volume I Following an earthquake in the South of the Peloponnese, a shepherd boy discovered the remains of a fifth-century Christian chapel. There are ancient manuscripts and a lead reliquary. Two weeks later, in Jacksonville, Pennsylvania, a commando helicopter breaks out Colonel Olrik from a high-security prison. The same night, in London, Captain Francis Blake, head of MI5, is made aware of this spectacular escape and goes to the United States to help the FBI track Olrik down, while his friend Professor Philip Mortimer receives a letter from the doctor Géorgios Markopoulos, curator of the Archaeological Museum of Athens, asking for his help on an extraordinary case. A few days later, Olrik wakes aboard the Arax where he finds his lackey, Jack. The owner of the yacht, the wealthy businessman Belos Beloukian, wants to hire him for a case that opposes Mortimer. At the same time, Mortimer lands in Athens where he is greeted by Eleni Philippides, the niece and Assistant to Dr. Markopoulos. While they drive to the Museum, a thug gets a flat tire from the car of Eleni to delay. But the impromptu arrival of Jim Radcliff, correspondent for the Philadelphia Chronicle and engaged to Eleni, allows them to hit the road. In the Museum, they discover the unconscious Dr. Markopoulos in his office and an individual masked fleeing with a metal box. Mortimer begins a pursuit of the Lincoln of the two thieves until a thunderstorm suddenly causes an accident in the car. The Professor retrieves the box as well as a stater of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, putting immediately an end to the storm, then returns to the Museum. Meanwhile, at the headquarters of the FBI in Washington, Blake is meeting with John Calloway, Chief of special operations, and his assistant, Jessie Wingo. They have traced the origin of the helicopters of the escape of Olrik until a certain Belos Beloukian, wealthy Armenian businessman and so-called former prisoner of war. However, they suspect it to be the Colonel Count Rainer von Stahl of SS- Totenkopfverbände whose fortune would be the Nazi war chest. In Athens, Dr. Markopoulos Mortimer explains the reason for his coming: he fell in possession of manuscripts indicating that in the 1st century a.d., the leader of a Christian congregation in Greece, named Nicodemus, had met Judas Iscariot, who failed his suicide mentioned in the Bible. On his death, he would have sent one of his faithful bury him with his 30 pieces of silver in a place unknown to all. However, one of taxpayers affected by the curse of God would have been preserved in a lead reliquary, crossing the centuries until its discovery in the chapel. At that time, the two men are being targeted by a shooter, but they come out unscathed. The Inspector Kamantis tells them that it's Kostas, the survivor of the accident of the Lincoln who wants to avenge his brother's death. On board the Arax, Beloukian confesses to Olrik he wants the purse of Judas for the destructive power and to become the master of evil on Earth. In Museum, Eleni says Mortimer is missing a manuscript indicating the place of the congregation of Nicodemus. Mortimer then decides to return to search the chapel with her. At night, Kostas triggers the hotel fire alarm and, disguised as a COP, isolates Mortimer in a service staircase in order to kill him, but Mortimer manages to narrowly escape. The Inspector Kamantis is highly advised to leave the city for safety, and in the early morning, Mortimer, Jim and Eleni take a train to the South of the Peloponnese. During the trip, Eleni and Mortimer discuss theories on the origin of the name of Judas the Iscariot. Meanwhile, on a small island in Mediterranean, Olrik enters in a room decorated with a large Nazi swastika where Beloukian chairs a meeting vowing to become the masters of the world. Beloukian then confesses to be Colonel Count Rainer von Stahl and hired him as head of the service of information and security, as it did to Basam Damdu. As a token of his resolution, Olrik kills Kostas on order of Rainer von Stahl. After vainly searching the Chapel, Mortimer and Eleni visit a young shepherd, but Olrik and Jack are already on the spot and escape with the manuscript. Mortimer begins pursuing them with two compatriots until they are blocked in the village by a herd of sheep. Mortimer catches Olrik and take the manuscript, but Jack arrives and is about to kill him when Jim comes in and puts him to flight. Mortimer warns Blake of the presence of Olrik in Greece and finds Eleni who tells their next destination: the island of Syrenios. To get there, Jim offers to use the yacht from the owner of his newspaper, Belos Beloukian, who turns out to know all of their adventures. But on board, Mortimer falls on Olrik and is made prisoner, as Eleni, Jim and Dr. Markopoulos. During the night, the Professor manages to escape the ship with a lifeboat, but it is a trap from Olrik, who removed out the oars and the food. Volume II Mortimer drifts for several days at sea until he is saved by a seaplane with on board Blake, John Calloway, Jessie Wingo and a commando of the MI6. They find the yacht of Beloukian in anchorage off the coast of Syrenios island in the sea of Crete. In the evening, they board it, but it's a trap and Rainer von Stahl, watching them from the side, orders the launch of a torpedo that destroys his ship. Taking advantage of this moment of inattention, Jim helps Eleni to escape. For their part, Jessie and Mortimer recover members of the commandos at the scene of the drama. While they are looking for Blake on board a canoe, the aircraft takes off and abandons them just as another torpedo targets it. After having found Blake, Jessie and Mortimer see Rainer von Stahl and his men board a submarine which has just surfaced. The three friends travel along the coast to the village of Syrenios. In view of the means available to Rainer von Stahl, it is clear to Blake and Jessie that he is supported by an organization such as the ODESSA and the former SS members. In Syrenios, Blake, Mortimer and Jessie find housing at the village Café. They then have the happy surprise to see Eleni after she escaped. The next day, the four friends go to the only cave on the island looking for clues of the Christian congregation. They find a kind of decorative fresco that Mortimer found a copy of in the breakfast room of their landlady. During the night, the professor eventually understands that a message is hidden in the fresco and deciphers it. The message directs them to the door of Orpheus, traditionally placed in the cave of Acheruse in Epirus, at the other end of the country. A Turkish smuggler agrees to take them on his old boat but once at sea, they have the unpleasant surprise to find Olrik. A struggle ensues during which the smuggler gets killed, Olrik falls into the water and the boat catches fire. Blake, Mortimer, Jessie and Eleni build a raft and collect Olrik. The next day, they are saved by the yacht of the same couple of British compatriots that had already met Mortimer. They return to Athens but upon their arrival, Olrik escapes from the boat. In the Embassy of Great Britain, Blake and Mortimer attend a meeting between British, American and Greek intelligence services. It is decided to continue the search for the grave of Judas hoping to exchange his location against the lives of the hostages, Jim and Dr. Markopoulos. Blake and Mortimer visit the cave of Acheruse, in Epirus, with a Greek Counterintelligence agent Konstantinos. At the bottom of the cave, they finally find the grave of Judas and his body intact. At that time, Rainer von Stahl and Olrik appear with Eleni who has betrayed them. A short gun battle ensues and Konstantinos gets shot. Mortimer gives back the thirty pieces of silver to Rainer von Stahl reluctantly. But when the latter rejoices, the corpse of Judas stands and curses him. A ray of light envelops Judas who thanks the Lord before falling to dust while a lightning bolt strikes Rainer von Stahl who catches fire. At the same time, an earthquake occurs and Mortimer, Blake and Eleni flee while Olrik falls into a crevasse. The other survivors were arrested by men of the MI6. With this information, MI6 men take over the fortress of the Nazis and release Jim and Dr. Markopoulos, while Colonel Georgiopoulos, Director of the Greek counter- intelligence, commits suicide after promising that their time will come. ==Volume I mistakes== * page 22, eagle misplaced on Nazi officer; * page 36, Corinthus channel outdated; * page 41, Colonel Olrik kills a man using an M16 not yet built at the time of action. ==English Publication== These two albums were published by Cinebook Ltd in 2012 as The Curse of the 30 Pieces of Silver, parts 1 & 2\\\\. ==App Game== These two albums were adapted to App Games, sold at iTunes as \\"Blake and Mortimer – The Curse of the Thirty Denarii – HD\\".

The book was published in France and Belgium on March 28, 2008. ==Plot== In Tanganyika, Professor Heidegang discovers in the lake of the Ngorongoro crater a secret entrance leading to a sort of sanctuary. He seizes a ring as proof of his discovery but menacing men appear and he flees, wounded in the thigh. In London, professor Philip Mortimer, fatigued and suffering from memory problems since his experience in the sarcophagi of Açoka, is recommended by his doctor to rest. Nastasia Wardynska, of the CSIR, brings the results of the analysis of the rock he brought back from Antarctica: it is a 350 million year old gold and diamond rock on which is engraved enigmatic signs that would prove the existence of a civilization at that time. At the Centaur Club, Mortimer shares his discoveries with his friend Captain Francis Blake, who had to go to France to meet Professor Labrousse, their French meteorologist friend, about his invention, Subglacior II. Mortimer goes to the Daily Mail archives where Mr Stone shows him an article on Dr. Heidegang that says paleontologists Mr and Mrs Leaky had been found delusional and clasping in their hands a ring engraved with the same enigmatic signs. On his return home, Mortimer immerses himself in reading his memories and discovers that the writer and amateur archaeologist Sarah Summertown, with whom he had an adventure in his youth, is a friend of the Leakys. In the archives of the Daily Mail, a mysterious man manages to consult the article on Prof. Heidegang by posing as Mortimer's assistant to Mr Stone. The next day, Mortimer goes to Sarah Summertown for the first time in many years. After having told each other their lives, Sarah agrees to help Mortimer on the condition that she accompany him on her adventure, and later Nastasia imposes her presence on him too. At the London airport, Mortimer, Sarah and Nastasia board for Nairobi under the surveillance of the mysterious man. In the plane, Sarah talks to them of artifacts engraved with the same enigmatic signs found in the four corners of the world, which could indicate the existence of a civilization at the time of the unique continent of Gondwana. In London, the mysterious man enters Blake's house during the night and threatens the captain with a pistol. He just asks him to listen to what he has to say and gives him his gun as a pledge of good faith. The next day, Blake takes the plane and goes to Antarctica with Professor Labrousse to take a delivery of a mysterious cargo. Meanwhile, the mysterious man is handed a passport, a plane ticket to Nairobi and cash by David Honeychurch, who has received these instructions from his superior Blake. Arriving at his destination, he settles in the same hotel as Mortimer and his two friends, and turns out to be Colonel Olrik in disguise. Meanwhile, Mortimer, Sarah and Nastasia are in the hospital to visit the delirious Dr. Heidegang. Mortimer manages to make contact with Heidegang by speaking German and learns that the guardians of Gondwana demand that the ring be returned to them. The three friends fly to Arusha, accompanied by Olrik in disguise who has managed to be invited by Nastasia. They find their guide Bombo, with whom they leave the next day in an all-terrain car for the crater of the Ngorongoro. Meanwhile, Olrik helps Uru, a young Maasai at the market, which causes him to fall into a trap. He is recognized by Razul the Bezendjas, his former henchman, who convinces him to team up to share the riches of the lost civilization of Gondwana. With the airship of Youssef, another former accomplice of Olrik, the three criminals can follow without being seen from the car carrying Motimer, Sarah, Nastasia, Bombo and Uru. When crossing a river, Nastasia falls into the water and is carried by the current to a bank downstream where she finds herself facing a lion. Uru, who has followed, fights the lion and eventually kills it before succumbing to his wounds. The young woman now faces a pack of African wild dogs and is saved by shots fired from an airship where she recognizes Olrik without believing it. Mortimer, Sarah and Bombo finally arrive at Nastasia after escaping the charge of a herd of elephants and the overthrow of their car. That evening, they attend the funeral of Uru in his village. The next day, Mortimer, Sarah, Nastasia and Bombo arrive at the Ngorongoro crater and plunge into the lake to find the secret entrance, not knowing that Olrik and Razul are right behind them. The four adventurers enter the sanctuary where they are quickly encircled by threatening guards, only protected by the ring. A translucent disc called Life tells them that they are in the Sanctuary of Life and then invites them to come forward to discover it. They find themselves in a huge room with an extraordinary machine and Life explains to them: more than 300 million years ago, a civilization developed like theirs, but before the tensions engendered by growing injustices, scientists created an incubator to spawn new individuals if humanity were to disappear, which eventually happened. Olrik and Razul appear and threaten Mortimer, Sarah, Nastasia and Bombo with their weapons. Olrik makes an astonishing revelation: since their experience of the Açoka sarcophagi, Mortimer's body is controlled by the spirit of Olrik while the spirit of Mortimer is stuck in the body of the criminal! The proof is Mortimer's signature, which is related to the mind and not the body. This revelation leads to confusion among the protagonists who no longer know whom to believe and threaten each other. Faced with this distressing spectacle, Life decides to send them back to the outside world, having erased their memory of the place in order to protect the incubator. On the shore of the lake, Olrik (in the body of Mortimer) is arrested by Captain Blake whom Mortimer (in Olrik's body) had convinced of his good faith in London. All of them board the seaplane of Lord Archibald Mac Auchentoshan, a billionaire protector of nature, which carries the Açoka sarcophagi found by Professor Labrousse in the ruins of the Indian Antarctic base. Mortimer thus regains his own body and proves it thanks to his writing. The sarcophagi are then thrown into the sea, never to be found again. ==English Publication== The first publication in English was by Cinebook Ltd, in September 2011.

It is located along the Saint Lawrence River at the mouth of the Batiscan River. ==History== In 1609, Samuel de Champlain, on his way to Lake Champlain, wrote of a Huron and Algonquin encampment one and a half leagues from St. Mary's River, which places it around the modern settlement of Batiscan. A year later, he wrote of having met an indigenous leader called \\"Batiscan\\". On his map of 1612, Champlain designated this area north of the Saint Lawrence River as the \\"region of bastisquan\\". While the name has virtually remained unchanged since first mentioned by Champlain, its meaning has remained uncertain, possibly meaning mist or haze (as often seen at the mouth of the Batiscan River), pulverized dried meat, rushes, or even making a mistake, taking a misstep. In 1636, the Madeleine Seignory was granted to Jacques Laferté, and included all the territory between the Chevrotière and Saint-Maurice Rivers, until 100 kilometers inland from the Saint Lawrence River. Subsequently, the seignory was divided into several smaller estates or fiefs, including the Batiscan Fiefdom that on March 13, 1639, was given to the Jesuits to accommodate the evangelization and the settlement of Indian tribes living there. This territory corresponded approximately to the current municipalities of Batiscan and Saint-Geneviève-de-Batiscan. The actual colonization of the area began in 1666, and it developed according to the seigneurial system of New France. The land granted to each settler was typically a long narrow rectangle with a proportion of about 1 to 10, that would allow each settler access to the river and the road. By 1709, all land bordering the Saint Lawrence River was occupied and a second row was equally divided inland. Over time, the territory of Batiscan grew to have 3 rows south-west of the Batiscan River and 2 rows north-east of it. Settlers would cultivate a portion of their land, but because of outdated farming techniques, isolation from markets, and lack of roads, agriculture remained a challenge. But with the Batiscan River providing access to the interior and the trading post at Trois-Rivières providing market access, people from Batiscan turned to trapping for survival. Logging also provided opportunities and several sawmills appeared along the rivers flowing through the area. On November 2, 1684, the Parish of Saint-François-Xavier-de-Batiscan was formed, named by the Jesuits after one of the co-founders of their order, Francis Xavier. The community itself developed as a linear village, stretching along the Chemin du Roy and without any real village centre, exceeding even the administrative boundaries of cadastral parishes. By the end of the French Era, the towns of Champlain, Batiscan, and Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade were all connected by a long ribbon of buildings. In 1845, the Parish Municipality of Saint-François- Xavier-de-Batiscan was formed. It was abolished a few years later but reestablished on July 1, 1855. The industrial revolution led to economic development and a small port on the river and the railroad were built. At the Batiscan station, a new small village centre grew. But the economic crisis of 1929 broke the momentum of the Station Village and gradually agriculture reclaimed primary place in the landscape and economy of Batiscan, with commercial and industrial activities remaining marginal. Because of its proximity to the regional hub of Trois-Rivières, the growing use of cars, and the improved road network, Batiscan is becoming a suburban community, leading to increased urbanization of the Saint Lawrence shore. In 1986, the Parish Municipality of Saint-François-Xavier-de-Batiscan became the Municipality of Batiscan. On December 31, 2001, it was transferred from the Francheville Regional County to the new Les Chenaux Regional County, following the creation of the new City of Trois-Rivières and the dissolution of the Francheville RCM.

It is known by many names, including bean strain of tobacco mosaic virus and Sunn-hemp rosette virus. SHMV is an intracellular parasite that infects plants. It can be seen only through an electron microscope. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that causes physical characteristics of spotting and/or discoloration. The Sunn-hemp mosaic virus is listed as a species within the genus Tobamovirus and the virus family Virgaviridae by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, who renamed it from \\"Sunnhemp\\" to \\"Sunn- hemp\\" in 1991. ==Transmission== Infected crops transmit the virus in a number of ways, but in most cases transmittal requires physical contact. This mean that touching an infected plant, then touching a healthy plant could cause the healthy plant to contract the virus. Using tools to trim an infected plant, then using them on a healthy plant without sterilizing them between uses can result in the transmission of the virus. The virus should be treated like it is airborne since an insect can transmit the virus, from plant to plant, just by flying around and making contact between plants. Hemp mosaic virus is particularly resilient and can infect the soil through the winter and into the following growing seasons for years. ==Effects== The Sunn-hemp mosaic virus should not be confused with the hemp mosaic virus. The virus causes cellular mutations, stunted growth, damages plants photosynthesis ability, and more. Cellular mutations usually manifest as discoloration and misshapen leaves. Discoloration usually manifests as yellow or grey mottling that can form a spotted, mosaic, or streak pattern. Misshapen leaves can be the result of damage to the plants at a cellular level, making them appear contorted and/or twisted. The stunted growth can cause a tremendous amount of crop loss due to lower than normal yields. Losses of 25% of flower production or more have been widely observed and reported. ==Treatment== There is no known cure for the hemp mosaic virus or other tobamoviruses. Once a plant has become infected with the virus the host will never be free from infection. The virus is destroyed through incineration of the infected tissues. Plants do have a natural defense in the form of a protein coating that protects the plants RNA. Different strains have varying resiliencies to hemp mosaic virus due to varying levels of the hormone responsible for the production of the protective protein coatings. ==Environment== Hemp mosaic virus is known as one of the most stable viruses. It has a very wide survival range. As long as the surrounding temperature remains below approximately 40 degrees Celsius, hemp mosaic virus can sustain its stable form. All it needs is a host to infect. Greenhouses and botanical gardens would provide the most favorable condition for the virus to spread, due to the high population density of possible hosts and the constant temperature throughout the year. The virus \\"occurs naturally in leguminous plants in Australia, India, Nigeria, and the United States\\" and has been described with a variety of names based on the host from which it was isolated. It has been observed to infect more than 40 host species across seven different families of plant. ==External links== *ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database: Hemp mosaic virus *Family Groups - The Baltimore Method *Hemp Mosaic Virus - RNA Pro ==References== Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Tobamovirus ","title":"Sunn-hemp mosaic virus"},{"id":"12356587","text":"One of a Kind may refer to: == Music == * One of a Kind (Bruford album) * One of a Kind (Dave Grusin album) * One of a Kind, an album by Della Reese * One of a Kind, an album by Pandora ** \\"One of a Kind\\", a song by Pandora * \\"One of a Kind\\" (Tammy Wynette song), a song by Tammy Wynette * One of a Kind (EP), by South Korean rapper G-Dragon * \\"One of a Kind (Love Affair)\\", a song by The Spinners * \\"One of a Kind\\", a song by Breaking Point from Coming of Age * \\"One of a Kind\\", a song by Booker T. & the MGs from The MG's * \\"One of a Kind\\", an album by the American group Orleans * \\"One of a Kind\\", a song by Bosson == Film and television == * One of a Kind (film), a 2013 French film * One of a Kind (1950s TV series), a Canadian panel show television series on CBC * One of a Kind (1978 TV series), a Canadian children's television series on CBC * \\"One of a Kind\\" (Brandy & Mr. Whiskers), an episode of Brandy & Mr. Whiskers * \\"One of a Kind\\" (Danny Phantom), an episode of Danny Phantom == Miscellaneous == * :Category:One-of-a-kind computers ","title":"One of a Kind"},{"id":"12356590","text":"Library logo Wenatchee Public Library- front entrance and sign NCW Libraries is an inter-county rural library district in northern Washington state.

It was largely inspired by a Rwandan orphan, by the name of Albertine, whom Fraser met while there in 2005. \\"Albertine\\" did not appear on any record chart, but it won Fraser the annual APRA Silver Scroll. ==Background and release== Fraser went to Rwanda on behalf of World Vision in 2005, the first of many trips. While there, she met a girl named Albertine, who had become orphaned by the genocide of 1994. Fraser described Albertine as \\"tall and beautiful\\". Her guide, Joel, took her to a village school in Kabuga district, and showed her a girl whose life the guide had personally saved. On her return, she felt she was \\"in a position where I could share [a] message with other people [and as a musician] that could be a great way to contribute in and of itself\\". \\"Albertine\\" tells the \\"tale of courage\\" of the two Rwandans in the 1990s. \\"Albertine\\" was released by Sony BMG on 9 July 2007 as a digital EP, as well as a CD single. ==Musical and lyrical composition== \\"Albertine\\" is a guitar-based pop ballad. Mike Schiller from PopMatters said that \\"its rhythmic, largely amelodic guitar work stands in sharp contrast to the lush, almost cloying melodic sensibilities of the rest of the album.\\" The lyrics of \\"Albertine\\" describe Fraser's feelings while visiting Rwanda, and her responsibility to help the Rwandan people. Chris Thomas from suite101.com described it as \\"a tale of one less fortunate than herself; one who needs the love, care and support of those who are more fortunate\\". Another reviewer said that \\"On its surface, 'Albertine' is a song about a tall and beautiful girl who survived the Rwandan genocide. Really, though, it’s a song about a whole lot more. Really, it’s a song about faith, it’s a song about hope, it’s a song about love… and it’s a song about deeds. ==Reception== The Southern Cross selected \\"Albertine\\" as one of the standout songs from Fraser's album. \\"Albertine\\" did not appear on any official record chart, and was the first of Fraser's singles that did not chart on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It did, however, win Fraser the 2007 APRA Silver Scroll, a peer-chosen award for songwriters. Other contenders for the Silver Scroll in 2007 included \\"Maybe\\" by Opshop, \\"Light Surrounding You\\" by Evermore, Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No! by The Mint Chicks, and Fraser's \\"Deciphering Me\\", also released from Albertine.

Fraser posted a blog entry in her official MySpace blog while en route to Rwanda from Johannesburg. In this entry, she stated: Later, on 15 July the video for the song was released on Brooke Fraser's official YouTube channel.

Artine Artinian (December 8, 1907 – November 19, 2005) was a distinguished French literature scholar of Armenian descent, notable for his valuable collection of French literary manuscripts and artwork. He was immortalized as a fictional character by his Bard colleague Mary McCarthy in the novel The Groves of Academe (1952) and by his friend Gore Vidal in the play The Best Man (1960).The New York Times. \\"Artine Artinian, 97, Dies; French Literature Scholar\\". ==Background== Artine Artinian was born in Pazardzhik, BulgariaEncyclopædia Britannica. to Armenian parents. In 1920, his family came to the United States, settling in Attleboro, Massachusetts. There, Artine worked as a shoeshine boy, learning English from listening to conversations as he worked. He was able to attend Bowdoin College (1931) with support from his customers, and in later years, he returned the favor by establishing a scholarship fund for needy students there. He received a diploma from the Université de Paris in 1932, an A.M. from Harvard the following year, and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1941. His dissertation, Maupassant Criticism in France, 1880-1940, with an Inquiry into His Present Fame and a Bibliography, was published the same year. By this time, Professor Artinian, who joined the Bard faculty in 1935, had already embarked on his multifaceted career. In 1949, he had the misfortune to brush up against one of academia's least savory characters, the eminent Belgian deconstructionist Paul de Man. Following his friend Mary McCarthy's recommendation, Artinian helped the newly immigrated de Man by offering him a substitute position as professor of French at Bard College, while Artinian spent the academic year of 1949–50 in France as a Fulbright fellow. In 1955, he edited and published \\"The Complete Short Stories of Guy de Maupassant\\" (Hanover House), which expurgated sixty-five inauthentic works from the Maupassant canon, and remains authoritative, even after half a century. In 1964, Artinian retired from his post as Chairman of the Division of Languages and Literature at Bard. His collecting did not stop with retirement, however, as he continued to amass manuscripts and artwork, especially portraits, including artist self-portraits. He donated a large amount of his collection of manuscripts and art to Bowdoin College and gave artwork to several universities and museums. His portrait collection, including works by André Gill, Henri Demare, Manuel Luque, Émile Cohl, Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Anthony Coffey and Paul Signac, is currently housed at the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin.Biographical Sketch.

He was born in New York, but moved to Los Angeles when he was 24. He started becoming involved in film and TV in the 1990s. He has written, directed, produced, and acted in many different films and TV shows. ==Early life== At the age of 20, Neil was a winner of a College Emmy Award and then subsequently landed a job as the Entertainment Reporter at WDIV-TV4, the NBC affiliate in Detroit. ==Television and film== At 24, Mandt moved to Los Angeles, where he became a field producer for ABC News; one of his first assignments was to produce ABC's coverage of the O.J. Simpson criminal trial. In November 1995, Mandt made the move to movies: he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in feature film, Hijacking Hollywood, starring Henry Thomas and Scott Thompson. Mandt spent the rest of the 90s directing two movies The Million Dollar Kid and Arthur's Quest before returning to television. Mandt then worked for NBC as a producer for its coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics; his work earned him an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The following spring Neil partnered with his brother Michael Mandt, creating Mandt Bros. Productions. Within weeks of creating the company the two sold two different series to ESPN; Reel Classics Uncut and the network's first reality show Beg, Borrow & Deal. In 2003 the Mandt Brothers created the ESPN show \\"Jim Rome is Burning\\" starring sports radio superstar Jim Rome; in 2004 they created the series \\"My Crazy Life\\" for E! Entertainment Television and in 2007 they created Destination Truth for the Sci Fi Channel. In 2006 Mandt returned to feature films when he wrote, directed, produced and starred in the indie flick, Last Stop for Paul. It won a top award, Best Picture or Best Screenplay, at 50 plus festivals it screened at in 2006 and 2007. Mandt created a separate internet version of the movie as a series of webisodes housed on the film's website www.laststopforpaul.com as well as Revver and Ifilm. Last Stop for Paul was released theatrically in North America on March 3 of 2008, making it the first internet web series ever to go from the web to the theaters.

Once the boys were signed by the Pirates, Neil Mandt, a feature film director in his own right, viewed the project as a feature film and he and his brother used their production team, and the original footage they had shot, to create a 9-minute trailer for a movie that had yet to be made. In December 2008, the Mandt brothers joined forces with seasoned movie producers Mark Ciardi, Gordon Gray and Joe Roth to shop the project. In early 2009, the screen rights to Singh and Patel's life story were purchased by Sony Pictures Entertainment for development at Columbia Pictures.[9] Sony hired Mitch Glazer to write the screenplay.[10] The film is scheduled for release in May 2014.

It affects cassava (Manihot esculenta) in India and certain other countries. It is considered to be an invasive species. ==History== This virus was unknown in India before the introduction of cassava into the country by the Portuguese in the seventeenth century, nor has a similar virus been reported in the New World where cassava originated. It is possible that the virus is native to India, affecting some yet-to-be-identified plant host, with the virus later adopting cassava as its preferred host; once present in a crop, the virus can be spread from plant to plant by insects such as whitefly. The virus was first noticed in India in 1942. Its incidence is higher in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the states where most cassava is grown, and it is of little consequence elsewhere in the country. Depending on the cultivar and the time of year, losses in root yield can vary from negligible to 84%. ==Hosts== In India, the natural hosts of ICMV are Manihot esculenta and Manihot carthaginensis subsp. glaziovii. Additionally, Jatropha curcas shows mosaic symptoms similar to cassava infected by ICMV; affected leaves have been shown to react in ELISA bioassay trials to African cassava mosaic virus antiserum, but follow up with a DNA B probe has provided negative results. This mosaic disease may be a new strain of ICMV affecting J. curcas, a plant with a potential as a biofuel crop, and it may become necessary to develop virus- resistant clones. ==Symptoms== The foliage of the plant exhibits the main symptoms which are yellow or green mosaic patterns appearing on the leaves, mottling, contortion, mis-shapen leaves, distorted growing points, stunting of the plant, rosetting, dwarfing and reduction in the root system. ==Transmission== ICMV is not transmissible by seed, so cassava seedlings are initially healthy. However the crop is mainly planted by stem cuttings and these are often infected. The main vectors involved in transferring the virus between plants are whitefly, particularly the silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). One strain of B. tabaci in India infests cassava, eggplant and tobacco, and transmits ICMV. A second biotype infests sweet potato, cotton, eggplant, tobacco and tomato but not cassava, and this seems incapable of transmitting ICMV. The spiralling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus, also colonises cassava in India but whether it has a role in transferring the virus remains unclear. ==ReferencesExternal links== *ICTVdB – The Universal Virus Database: Indian cassava mosaic virus Category:Viral plant pathogens and diseases Category:Begomovirus ","title":"Indian cassava mosaic virus"},{"id":"12356683","text":"The Aladdin Free Public License, abbreviated AFPL, is a license written by L.

However, after meeting professional journalists at Duke through the DeWitt Wallace Center's Visiting Media Fellows program, she decided to reorient her ambitions, and pursue journalism. She graduated from Duke University in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science degree in public policy. After graduating, Grumman became a reporter for the Raleigh News & Observer. Her first major assignment was to take a Greyhound bus from one end of the state to the other and write about what she saw and whom she met. On this journey, she found herself impassioned by the types of stories that could not be found in press release, government reports or police blotters. \\"I was hooked,\\" she wrote in an autobiographical sketch for \\"Meet the Tribune Editorial Board,\\" a section published in the December 30, 2002, Chicago Tribune. \\"I wanted to see more of the world and to understand the connection between individuals, particularly those with faint voices, and the government institutions designed to serve them.\\" In 1989, she worked in China as a stringer for The Washington Post, covering the student democracy movement that unfolded in Tienanmen Square. Grumman went on to earn her master's at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. [duke piece] \\"The Kennedy School enhanced my journalism by teaching me the broader context of issues,\\" she said in an interview. By 1994, Grumman had returned to her home state of Illinois as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune. She concentrated on issues about education, juvenile justice, Illinois politics and the death penalty. In 2000, she joined the Tribune's editorial board. ==First Five Years Fund== The First Five Years Fund's goal is to expand high-quality early learning services to one million additional children from birth to age five, with half of that expansion serving infants, toddlers and their families. Through public education, federal advocacy and coordinated outreach, the First Five Years Fund hopes to garner increased support for early learning activities that are: * Integrated from birth to age five, with special focus on infants and toddlers; * High-quality and comprehensive in scope; and * Focused first on serving those children most at- risk \\"Early learning is one of the smartest public investments that we can make. Children shouldn't be playing catch-up when they enter kindergarten, and yet so many do. This emphasis on early learning services for babies and toddlers is because by the time a child turns three, a majority of their brain growth has already occurred. If we want greater school success later and a better-skilled workforce, we need to ensure the proper development of our most at-risk children at these earliest ages. Our goal then, is to support high- quality learning programs, such as Early Head Start, followed by preschool, for these earliest learners so that even the most at-risk children arrive at kindergarten ready to learn.\\" Cornelia Grumman, First Five Years Fund. Grumman stepped down as the Executive Director of the First Five Years Fund in March, 2012. ==Personal== Today, Grumman is married to journalist James Warren (journalist), they have two sons, Blair and Eliot. They currently reside in the north side of Chicago. ==Awards== Grumman received a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for her series of Chicago Tribune editorials \\"Restoring Justice,\\" that she wrote on capital punishment. Her editorials called on government officials to improve procedures for eyewitness identifications, address serious inequities in death-sentence convictions related to race and geography, narrow the eligibility for death penalty and acknowledge the problems with executing the mentally retarded, the mentally ill, and juvenile offenders. \\"With the authority to impose the death penalty comes a responsibility to get it right,\\" she wrote in her October 3, 2002 editorial, \\"The Future of Capital Punishment.\\" She fervently added, \\"Now's the time to get it right. Get it right or get rid of it.\\" In 2001, 2005 and 2006, Grumman also received Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism for editorials on children and family issues. She received a 2001 Studs Terkel award for her coverage of disadvantaged communities and three Herman Kogan awards for editorials about the criminal justice system. ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Buffett Early Childhood Fund * The Gates Foundation * George Kaiser and J.B.

In coordination chemistry the bite angle is the ligand–metal–ligand bond angle of coordination complex containing a bidentate ligand. This geometric parameter is used to classify chelating ligands, including those in organometallic complexes. It is most often discussed in terms of catalysis, as changes in bite angle can affect not just the activity and selectivity of a catalytic reaction but even allow alternative reaction pathways to become accessible. Although the parameter can be applied generally to any chelating ligand, it is commonly applied to describe diphosphine ligands, as they can adopt a wide range of bite angles. ==Diamines== Diamines form a wide range of coordination complexes. They typically form 5- and 6-membered chelate rings. Examples of the former include ethylenediamine and 2,2′-bipyridine. Six-membered chelate rings are formed by 1,3-diaminopropane. The bite angle in such complexes is usually near 90°. Longer chain diamines, which are \\"floppy\\", tend not to form chelate rings. ==Diphosphines== Figure 1. Dicylohexylphosphinomethane, dcpm, which forms a four-membered chelate ring. Figure 2. DPEphos, which forms an eight-membered chelate ring. Diphosphines are a class of chelating ligands that contain two phosphine groups connected by a bridge (also referred to as a backbone). The bridge, for instance, might consist of one or more methylene groups or multiple aromatic rings with heteroatoms attached. Examples of common diphosphines are dppe, dcpm (Figure 1), and DPEphos (Figure 2). The structure of the backbone and the substituents attached to the phosphorus atoms influence the chemical reactivity of the diphosphine ligand in metal complexes through steric and electronic effects. Examples Steric characteristics of the diphosphine ligand that influence the regioselectivity and rate of catalysis include the pocket angle, solid angle, repulsive energy, and accessible molecular surface. Also of importance is the cone angle, which in diphosphines is defined as the average of the cone angle for the two substituents attached to the phosphorus atoms, the bisector of the P–M–P angle, and the angle between each M–P bond. Larger cone angles usually result in faster dissociation of phosphine ligands because of steric crowding. ==The natural bite angle== The natural bite angle (βn) of diphosphines, obtained using molecular mechanics calculations, is defined as the preferred chelation angle determined only by ligand backbone and not by metal valence angles (Figure 3). Figure 3. Bite angle of a diphosphine ligand bound to rhodium. Both steric bite angle effect and the electronic bite angle effects are recognized. The steric bite angle effect involves the steric interactions between ligands or between a ligand and a substrate. The electronic bite angle effect, on the other hand, relates to the electronic changes that occur when the bite angle is modified. This effect is sensitive to the hybridization of metal orbitals. This flexibility range accounts for the diverse conformations of the ligand with energies slightly above the strain energy of the natural bite angle. The bite angle of a diphosphine ligand also indicates the distortion from the ideal geometry of a complex based on VSEPR models. Octahedral and square planar complexes prefer angles near 90° while tetrahedral complexes prefer angles near 110°. Since catalysts often interconvert between various geometries, the rigidity of the chelate ring can be decisive. A bidentate phosphine with a natural bite angle of 120° may preferentially occupy two equatorial sites in a trigonal bipyramidal complex whereas a bidentate phosphine with a natural bite angle of 90° may preferentially occupy apical-equatorial positions. Diphosphine ligands with bite angles of over 120° are obtained using a bulky, stiff diphosphine backbones. Diphosphines of wide bite angles are used in some industrial processes. ==A case study: hydroformylation== The hydroformylation of alkenes to give aldehydes is an important industrial process. Almost 6 million tons of aldehydes are produced by this method annually. Rhodium complexes containing diphosphine ligands are active hydroformylation catalysts. The ratio of linear to branched aldehyde product depends on the structure of the catalyst. One intermediate, [Rh(H)(alkene)(CO)L], exists in two different isomers, depending on the position of phosphine ligands (Figure 4). Figure 4. EA and EE isomers of Rh(H)(alkene)(CO)L. Diphosphine ligands such as dppe, which has a bite angle of about 90°, span the equatorial and apical positions (AE isomer). Diphosphines with larger bite angles (above 120°) preferentially occupy a pair of equatorial positions (EE isomer). It is believed that the EE isomer favors formation of linear aldehydes, the desired product. In an effort to create rhodium complexes in which the phosphine ligands preferentially occupy the equatorial positions, the use of diphosphine ligands with wide bite angles such as BISBI (Figure 5) has been investigated. :Figure 5. BISBI, a diphosphine with a bite angle of 113°. With a bite angle of approximately 113°, BISBI spans sites on equatorial plane of the trigonal bipyramidal intermediate complex (Figure 6). Figure 6. BISBI occupies sites on the equatorial plane. The structure of the intermediate [Rh(H)(diphosphine)(CO)2] does not however determine the regioselectivity of the hydroformylation. Instead, the formation of the linear vs. branched aldehydes is determined upon formation of [Rh(H)(diphosphine)CO(alkene)] and the subsequent hydride migration step. The bite angle affect the steric crowding at the Rh atom that results from the interactions of the bulky backbone of the ligand with substrate. The wide bite angle that results from the backbone allows the five- coordinate [Rh(H)(diphosphine)CO(alkene)] intermediate to adopt a structure that relieves steric hindrance. Thus, BISBI occupies the equatorial positions, where it has the most space. This preference of a transition state that relieves steric hindrance favors the formation of the linear aldehyde. The regioselectivity is also controlled by the hydride migration, which is usually irreversible in the formation of linear aldehydes. Furthermore, studies using Xantphos ligands (ligands with bulky backbones) in hydroformylation have indicated an increase in the rate of catalysis in metal complexes that contain diphosphine ligands with larger bite angles. The electronic effect of this increase in reaction rate is uncertain since it mainly depends on the bonding between the alkene and rhodium. Large bite angles promote alkene to rhodium electron donation, which results in an accumulation of electron density on the rhodium atom. This increased electron density would be available for π-donation into the anti-bonding orbitals of other ligands, which could weaken other M-L bonds within the catalyst, leading to higher rates. The application of diphosphine ligands to catalysts is not limited to the process of hydroformylation. Hydrocyanation and hydrogenation reactions also implement phosphine-mediated catalysts. ==See also== * Constrained geometry complex * Josiphos ligands ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Organometallic chemistry Category:Coordination chemistry ","title":"Bite angle"},{"id":"12356749","text":"The Fort Yuma Indian Reservation is a part of the traditional lands of the Quechan people.

The southern terminus of US 93 is located at a junction (rebuilt and relocated between February 2008 and February 2010) with US 60 in Wickenburg, a small town about northwest of Phoenix. It heads towards the northwest from this junction to an intersection with SR 89 (former US 89) across the Maricopa - Yavapai county line just northwest of town. SR 89 heads northeast to Prescott while US 93 continues its northwesterly heading, as a mainly two-lane highway with passing lanes every few miles. US 93 continues to the northwest to a junction with SR 71 at a diamond interchange southwest of Congress. As it continues to the northwest through this scenic but remote rural area, the highway is known as the Joshua Forest Parkway of Arizona. The highway widens to four lanes at the Santa Maria River and continues towards the northwest past a junction with SR 97 on its way to the town of Wikieup. Before reaching that town, it passes the tiny settlement of Nothing (just across the Yavapai - Mohave county line) and crosses Burro Creek over dual steel arch bridges about over the creek. After passing through Wikieup, US 93 curves north to follow the western edge of the Big Sandy River and one of its tributaries, Knight Creek, on its way toward Interstate 40 (I-40). At I-40's exit 71, US 93 merges with the Interstate freeway and share the same alignment heading west until they reach Kingman. The two split in Kingman with I-40 heading towards the south to skirt the southern end of the Black Mountains before curving west and into California and US 93 heading northwest towards Las Vegas. A project is currently underway to design and build a free-flowing connection between I-40 and US 93 in western section of Kingman, to avoid the current diamond interchange (exit 48) at Beale Street and the approximately one mile section of congested, undivided roadway that US 93 motorists must navigate before the road widens back into a four-lane divided facility. Northwest of Kingman and just over Coyote Pass, US 93 has an interchange with SR 68 (exit 67). This junction incorporates a large Commercial Vehicle Inspection Station (CVIS), which ADOT calls a \\"Port of Entry\\" (POE), for southbound and eastbound commercial traffic. Highway 68 heads west over the Black Mountains to Davis Dam, Laughlin and Bullhead City (the latter via SR 95), while US 93 continues as a four-lane divided route towards the northwest. Running through the long Detrital Valley, with the Black Mountains to the west and the Cerbat Mountains and then the White Hills to the east, US 93 passes several small settlements in this mostly remote area. As it nears the Nevada state line, it enters the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and climbs over Householder Pass, before crossing into Nevada via the Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge over the Black Canyon just downstream of the Colorado River from Hoover Dam. US 93 continues into Nevada to the cities of Boulder City, Henderson and Las Vegas as part of Interstate 11 (I-11). ==History== The route between Kingman and Hoover Dam first became part of the state highway system in 1934 when it was designated as SR 69. At the time, Hoover Dam was still under construction and the highway did not link to Nevada. The dam was completed the following year in 1935 enabling traffic to cross over the top of the dam. In that year, US 466 was designated over SR 69 from Kingman to Hoover Dam. US 93 was extended south from (then) US 91 at Glendale, Nevada later the same year. In 1935, Arizona proposed for an extension of US 93 from Kingman to Ash Fork, overlapping US 66, and then south to Phoenix. This proposal was protested by the towns of Aguila and Wickenburg that argued that US 93 should pass through their towns rather than the proposed alignment to the east. The town of Wickenburg contested that a direct routing between Phoenix and Kingman would be shorter than the routing through Ash Fork and that it would provide a necessary connection between Phoenix, the state capital and the northwestern part of the state. Until 1937, the original proposed extension overlapping US 66 stayed in planning as US 93T. Another route, US 193, was also planned, travelling from Phoenix through Sacaton and Casa Grande before terminating in Picacho. US 193 was briefly reworked under the designation US 93A before the proposal was abandoned in 1937. On March 23, 1946, what would become the southern leg of US 93 past Kingman was added to the State Highway System as State Route 93. Between 1942 and 1958, the highway was rebuilt and reworked into a suitable highway for an eventual extension of US 93. Though the state wanted US 93 to be extended over all of SR 93 through Phoenix, Casa Grande and Tucson to the Mexico border in Nogales, a southern extension was only accepted by the AASHTO to US 89 north of Wickenburg in 1965. The rest of SR 93 kept its state route designation until 1984. Until 1992, US 93 ended a short distance north of Wickenburg, Arizona at a junction with U.S. Route 89. When US 89 was decommissioned in the area, the US 93 designation was carried on into Wickenburg. Between 2006 and 2012, there were several widening projects completed on the section between Wickenburg and Interstate 40. New bypass bridge US 93 (with US 60 to the southeast of Wickenburg) is the shortest route between the fast-growing cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix, two of the largest cities in the Southwest (and is an officially designated portion of the CANAMEX Corridor). Upgrades of US 60 and US 93 to four-lane freeway status are scheduled between Las Vegas and Phoenix; as of 2019, most sections north of the Santa Maria River are already at four-lane expressway status (with some of the newest portions presumably built to Interstate standards) with construction ongoing. This routing is part of Interstate 11 (I-11) which is connected with Interstate 215 (I-215), Interstate 515 (I-515), U.S. Route 95 (US 95) and State Route 564 (former SR 146) at the Henderson Spaghetti Bowl (also known as the \\"Hender-Bender\\") interchange in Henderson, Nevada and will connect Interstate 10 in Tonopah. A segment of this new highway consists of a new route across the Colorado River called the Hoover Dam Bypass. The new crossing is the Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, the first so- called concrete-steel composite arch bridge built in the United States. The bridge is with a main span. The roadway is above the Colorado River. The bypass replaced the old section of US 93 that approached and crossed directly over Hoover Dam, which was inadequate by modern standards, because there was one narrow lane in each direction, including several hairpin turns, many dangerous curves and poor sight distances. Also, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, truck traffic over the Hoover Dam had been diverted south to a river crossing near Laughlin, Nevada via State Route 68, State Route 163 in Nevada and US 95, in an effort to safeguard the dam from hazardous spills or explosions. ==Junction list== Notes ==Special routes== US 93 has two special/bannered routes within the state of Arizona. Hoover Dam temporary route State Route 93 Temporary (SR 93T or SR 93X) is an unsigned long state highway near the Hoover Dam in Mohave County, Arizona. The route was originally part of the US 93 segment that travelled over Hoover Dam. It was redesignated as SR 93X on January 1, 2011 following the completion of the Hoover Dam Bypass. Unlike most unrelinquished sections of U.S. Highways in Arizona, the old Hoover Dam route was given a state route designation instead of a U.S. Highway one. SR 93X is not related in any way to SR 93, which was the original designation of US 93 between Kingman and Wickenburg, as well as a failed extension of US 93 from Wickenburg to Nogales. The route begins at the Nevada state line on the Hoover Dam, heading southeast, before switch-backing up a hillside at the southeastern end of the dam. ADOT ownership of SR 93X begins exactly southeast of the Hoover Dam on Kingman Wash Access Road near the Arizona side Hoover Dam Lookout. The route proceeds southeasterly along Kingman Wash Access Road, crossing under US 93 less than a mile from the lookout. Approximately from its western terminus, SR 93 arrives at a freeway interchange with US 93, which also serves as its eastern terminus. Currently, the majority of SR 93X is gated off to public traffic. The western first of the route and Arizona side of the Hoover Dam are still accessible to public traffic, but can only be reached via US 93, SR 172 and Hoover Dam Access Road through Nevada. There is currently no open road for motorists to leave the Arizona side of the Dam, whilst remaining in the state. ;Major intersections Kingman spur route U.S. Route 93 Spur (US 93 Spur) is a long unsigned spur route of US 93 in Kingman, Arizona. Originally a small section of US 66, it became part of the Kingman I-40 Business Loop (I-40 BL) on October 26, 1984 upon the decommissioning of the former highway in Arizona. The majority of I-40 BL was retired to the city of Kingman in 2002, with two sections, each less than a mile long, remaining under ADOT ownership at I-40 exits 48 and 53 respectively. On September 18, 2009, the I-40 BL designation was decommissioned. The two remaining segments owned by ADOT became a minor southwestern extension of SR 66 and a new route designated US 93 Spur. US 93 Spur begins at an intersection with I-40 and US 93 at Beale Street and I-40 exit 48\\\\. The unsigned spur route continues west on Beale Street, ending about three blocks east of I-40 and US 93 at an intersection with \\"Route 66\\", Grandview Avenue and Beale Street in front of Locomotive Park. ;Major intersections ==ReferencesExternal links== 93 Arizona Category:Transportation in Maricopa County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Yavapai County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Mohave County, Arizona ","title":"U.S. Route 93 in Arizona"},{"id":"12356933","text":"U.S. Route 60 (US 60) is an east–west United States Highway within New Mexico.

East of town the two highways encounter NM 212, a spur to Fort Sumner State Monument, and NM 252 in Taiban. US 60/US 84 passes through Tolar near the De Baca–Roosevelt county line. The two routes do not stay in Roosevelt County for long, however, proceeding into Curry County west of Melrose. The highways pass through Melrose, St. Vrain, and Grier before widening out to a four-lane highway as they approach Clovis, the Curry County seat. In Clovis, the home of Cannon Air Force Base, the highways meet up with US 70, which joins the concurrency. The three highways proceed through Texico, and just before the Texas state line, US 60 leaves the concurrency and heads northeast while US 70/US 84 continues eastward. For the distance of more than 300 miles (480 km) between Abo Pass and Amarillo, the highway parallels the Southern Transcon, one of the busiest transcontinental railroads in the west. ==Major intersectionsReferences== 60 New Mexico Category:Transportation in Catron County, New Mexico Category:Transportation in Socorro County, New Mexico Category:Transportation in Torrance County, New Mexico Category:Transportation in De Baca County, New Mexico Category:Transportation in Roosevelt County, New Mexico Category:Transportation in Curry County, New Mexico ","title":"U.S. Route 60 in New Mexico"},{"id":"12356973","text":" USS Quest (AM-281) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II.

The Diggi Palace Hotel serves as the main venue of the festival, with sessions held in the Hall of Audience and throughout the gardens of the Diggi Palace in the city centre. The festival directors are the writers Namita Gokhale and William Dalrymple and it is produced by Sanjoy Roy of Teamwork Arts. Surina Narula is the Founder Sponsor and Festival Advisor for the literature festival. The Festival is an Initiative of the Jaipur Virasat Foundation (JVF) founded by Faith Singh, originally as a segment of the Jaipur Heritage International Festival in 2006, and developed into a free- standing festival of literature standing on its own feet in 2008. JVF's Community Director Vinod Joshi is its regional advisor. All events at the festival are free and not ticketed. In 2012, a number of events occurred related to the Salman Rushdie and the Satanic Verses controversy. A number of events created by the organisers of JLF, loosely named JLF International, have taken place in other cities around the world. ==History, timeline== 2006 The 2006 inaugural Jaipur Literature Festival featured 18 writers, including Hari Kunzru, William Dalrymple, Shobhaa De and Namita Gokhale and 14 others.\\"Pen On The Rostrum \\", OutlookIndia.com, 17 April 2006 It drew a crowd of about 100 attendees, some of whom \\"appeared to be tourists who had simply got lost\\", according to the event's co-director William Dalrymple.\\"Literary festival draws big stars\\" , The Brunei Times, 1 February 2010. 2007 In 2007 the festival grew in size and featured Salman Rushdie, Kiran Desai, Suketu Mehta, Shashi Deshpande, and William Dalrymple. 2008 In 2008 the festival continued to expand with about 2,500 attendees and the following authors/speakers: Ian McEwan, Donna Tartt, John Berendt, Paul Zacharia, Indra Sinha, Uday Prakash, Christopher Hampton, Manil Suri, Miranda Seymour 2009 The 2009 festival had about 12,000 attendees and over 140 authors/speakers including Vikram Seth, Pico Iyer, Michael Ondaatje, Simon Schama, Tina Brown, Hanif Kureshi, Hari Kunzru, Pankaj Mishra, Tariq Ali, Ahmed Rashid, Patrick French, Mohsin Hamid, Mohammed Hanif, Wendy Doniger, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Tarun Tejpal, Sashi Tharoor, U R Ananthmurthy, Alka Saraogi, Anuragh Mathur, Ashok Vajpeyi, Ashis Nandy, Basharat Peer, Charles Nicoll, Christophe Jaffrelot, Colin Thubron, Daniyal Mueenuddin, Geetanjali Shree, Mukul Kesavan, Musharraf Ali Farooqui, G.

Rushdie later cancelled, and indeed cancelled his complete tour of India, citing possible threats to his life as the primary reason. Rushdie investigated police reports that hitmen had been hired to assassinate him and implied that the police might have exaggerated the potential danger. Police said that Ruchir Joshi, Jeet Thayil, Hari Kunzru and Amitava Kumar fled Jaipur on the advice of officials at the Jaipur Literature Festival after reading excerpts from The Satanic Verses, which is banned in India. Kunzru later wrote, \\"Our intention was not to offend anyone's religious sensibilities, but to give a voice to a writer who had been silenced by a death threat\\". A proposed video link session between Rushdie and the Jaipur Literature Festival ran into difficulty after the government pressured the festival to stop it. Rushdie expressed disappointment \\"on behalf of India\\", \\"an India in which religious extremists can prevent free expression of ideas at a literary festival, in which the politicians are too, let's say, in bed with those groups...for narrow electoral reasons, in which the police forces are unable to secure venues against demonstrators even when they know the demonstration is on its way\\". The Chairman of the Press Council of India and former judge of the Supreme Court Markandey Katju said that although he was \\"not in favour of religious obscurantism\\", he found Rushdie a \\"poor\\" and \\"substandard writer\\" and the focus on him detracting from more fundamental issues of \\"colonial inferiority complex\\" among educated Indians and what a literary mission could be about. Scottish novelist Allan Massie wrote, \\"The response to words should be words and words in the form of argument, not abuse\\". Peter Florence, Director, Hay Festivals, said the whole affair showed the importance of book festivals. On 28 January, Rushdie responded to Chetan Bhagat via Twitter after the popular writer taunted him and his work. 2015 The 2015 festival was scheduled from 21 to 25 January. Earlier that year it had been reported that the tentative list of speakers this season would number 181, including V. S. Naipaul, Chetan Bhagat and Amish Tripathi. The festival also expanded beyond the four walls of Diggi Palace, holding more than 300 events in 10 venues, including the Music Stage at Clarks Amer, the Jaipur BookMark at Narain Niwas, and two special sessions at Amer Fort and Hawa Mahal to focus on heritage and culture, supported by Rajasthan Tourism. Notable sessions of the festival in 2015 included two packed sessions each for Nobel Laureate Sir V. S.

The highway proceeds north passing near Grand Canyon National Park and through the Navajo Nation. Near the Utah state line the highway splits into U.S. 89 and U.S. Route 89A. The Alternate is the original highway; what is now the main highway was constructed in the 1960s to serve the Glen Canyon Dam. The two highways rejoin in Kanab, Utah. The main branch passes over the Colorado River just south of the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell near Page then enters Utah. The Alternate branch crosses the Colorado River at Navajo Bridge and proceeds to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon before entering Utah. ==History== Prior to 1992, the southern terminus of US 89 was at Nogales, Arizona. US 89 ran concurrently with Interstate 19 (I-19) until Green Valley. The route was taken (in a northerly direction) through Tucson via 6th Avenue, Congress Street and Granada Avenue. The route was carried out of Tucson via State Route 77 (SR 77). Further north it was carried via the Pinal Pioneer Parkway northwest out of Oracle Junction on SR 79\\\\. In Maricopa County, it ran concurrently with existing US 60 along Main Street in Mesa, Apache Boulevard and Mill Avenue in Tempe, then along Van Buren Street in Phoenix to Grand Avenue, then to Wickenburg. Departing Wickenburg, it followed US 93 and SR 89 to Prescott. Departing Prescott, the route followed present-day SR 89 to Ash Fork, then ran east concurrently with I-40 to Flagstaff. In Flagstaff, US 89 ran along old Route 66, Milton Road and Santa Fe Avenue. The highway crossed the Little Colorado River at Cameron on the Cameron Suspension Bridge until 1959, when the bridge was retired and replaced by a parallel span. On February 20, 2013, the main alignment of US 89 was closed in both directions approximately south of Page due to a landslide that caused the roadway to buckle and subside. Traffic was re-routed via of secondary and tertiary roads on the Navajo Reservation. Alternate routes through Las Vegas, Nevada, or Hurricane, Utah, and Marble Canyon (US 89A) were also suggested. US 89T (see below) opened in August 2013 as a bypass of the closed section, utilizing Navajo Route 20 as an alignment. U.S. 89 reopened in March 2015 after a $25 million repair project. ==Major intersectionsU.S. Route 89T== U.S. Route 89T (US 89T or US 89X) was the designation for Navajo Route 20 (N20), a road running mostly parallel to US 89 in Arizona. Added to the Arizona state highway system in 2013, US 89T served as a temporary detour for a closed section of US 89\\\\. The route was long. The need for US 89T arose in February 2013, when a geological event caused a stretch of US 89 to buckle south of Page. The loss of this stretch of road forced detours for traffic entering the Page area from the south. The Navajo Nation declared a state of emergency. Motorists were rerouted on a detour via US 160 and SR 98 or a detour on N20, which had a unpaved stretch. At the same time, commute times into Page increased, and merchants in Page and the surrounding area lost significant business. The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) added the road to the state highway system as US 89T and quickly moved to get money ($35 million from the Federal Highway Administration's emergency relief project fund) and equipment to pave the road. As the Navajo had wanted to pave N20 for decades, and some design and environmental clearances had already been obtained, it took just 79 days to pave N20 in a project that might have otherwise taken more than a year. In addition to pavement, right-of-way and fencing to separate the road from the local livestock population were required. The improved road opened to traffic on August 29, 2013. Plans called for the road to be used for three years before the road reverted to Bureau of Indian Affairs jurisdiction. Initially, the route lacked proper fencing, cattle guards, and pavement markings to support safe travel at higher speeds. As a result, US 89T was open to local traffic only at night, and posted speed limits as low as . As of October 15, US 89T restrictions were lifted following the installation of upgraded control features. With the reopening of mainline US 89 in March 2015, the US 89T designation was retired and ownership of the route returned to the Navajo Nation in April 2015. The route from The Gap to SR 98 is currently designated only as N20. ;Major intersections ==See also== *U.S. Route 89A *Arizona State Route 89 *Arizona State Route 89A ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *US 89 Landslide at ADOT 89 Arizona Category:Transportation in Coconino County, Arizona ","title":"U.S. Route 89 in Arizona"},{"id":"12356981","text":"The H Street Festival is a yearly street festival held in the eastern blocks of H Street in the Near Northeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C.. ==History== The H Street Festival was first organized by the Community- Business Action Coalition (COMBAC).

The Arsenal Academy was burned by Union troops in 1865 and never reopened; the only surviving building became the South Carolina Governor's Mansion. The Citadel Academy and the South Carolina Military Academy closed in 1865; its buildings were in Federal hands until 1882.

After spending three years on the soap, Chappell left and eventually took roles on One Life to Live as Maggie Carpenter from 1995-1997 and Guiding Light as Olivia Spencer from 1999-2009, where she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2002. After 16 years away, Chappell returned to the show in October 2009 following the cancellation of GL, which ended its run less than a month earlier. While meeting with executives of another show, Gary Tomlin, the co-executive of DAYS at the time called Chappell and asked her to return. After nearly two years back, Chappell's contract was not renewed and she exited the show in September 2011. Following her exit, Chappell joined the cast of CBS' The Bold and the Beautiful as Danielle in the show's first lesbian storyline. ==Storylines== 1990–93 Dr. Carly Manning arrived in Salem after she got the idea to move there from the vacationing Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis and Justin Kiriakis. Carly believed Salem would a suitable town to live in because no one knew her. After arriving in town, she was shocked to run into not one but two people from her past. First, there Jennifer Horton with whom she had attended boarding school and then Bo Brady who had intervened in a fight between her and her then-boyfriend, Lawrence Alamain. Luckily for Carly, Bo did not remember her and the two do not get along. Eventually, Bo and Carly developed feelings as she cared for his son Shawn-Douglas Brady. Carly discovered her brother Frankie Brady was being held captive by Lawrence Alamain., who agreed to release Frankie if Carly handed over her family fortune and his enemy Bo. Carly had recently been revealed to be Katerina, a member of the powerful European Von Leuschner family and was torn between saving her brother and the man she began to have feelings for. Meanwhile, Jack Deveraux found Frankie and Jennifer who was held captive. Carly and Bo continued to grow closer but he was unable to fully commit to her. Carly accepted a marriage proposal to marry his biological father Victor Kiriakis. Carly was severely unhappy during her marriage to Victor and he knew she loved his son. Victor faked his death and move to Mexico, but after he was found the marriage was annulled and Carly accepted Bo's proposal but they never went through with a legal marriage following their symbolic ceremony. Carly began to remember her son whom died shortly after birth and told Bo what was on her mind. Bo learned that Carly became pregnant with the child of her boyfriend James, who was using an alias and was really Lawrence Alamain. She sought the help of his aunt Vivian Alamain, who secretly faked the child's death after he was born when it was believed he died of hydrocephalus. Vivian actually raised him as her own son, Nicholas Alamain. Vivian was unhappy at Carly and Nicholas' reunion and attempted to ruin Carly's life by framing her for the deaths of her own patients at the hospital to make Carly seem like an angel of mercy serial killer. Vivian injected cleaning fluid into the systems of Carly's terminally ill patients and Carly was considered the culprit. Vivian used a herbal medical treatment to place Carly into a coma to appear dead. In one of the most stunning plot lines ever to be featured on a daytime soap, Carly awoke in her coffin which was complete with enough essentials after she had been buried alive. Eventually, Vivian overcomes her own lapsed reality from the herbs and has Lawrence release her. After everyone learned Carly was alive, Lawrence told her that he wanted to have a life together with their son. Bo and Carly agreed that they could no longer make their relationship work and so Carly, Lawrence and Nicholas left town to begin a new life in France. 2009–11 Almost sixteen years later, Carly and Lawrence are seen together in a hotel room in Monaco, where they are arguing. The altercation results in Carly stabbing her husband in the stomach with a letter opener as he mumbles his final words being \\"You'll never find...\\" Carly secretly left the country to come to Salem in hopes of getting help from Bo, the only person she ever trusted. While separated from his wife, Carly broke into Bo and Hope's house to ask for his help and he agreed to hide her in his house since the Alamains were looking for her. Soon after, Victor suspected that Carly was back in Salem and reported her to the police and she was arrested but later released back into the custody of Bo. Vivian then cleared Carly's name in order to get revenge on her rather than have her in punished in prison for Lawrence's murder. Vivian soon learned that Carly had a daughter living in town, which turns out to be Melanie Layton, whom Lawrence gave up for adoption due to Carly's affair with another man. Carly accidentally shot Melanie on her wedding day to Philip Kiriakis when trying to stop Vivian from killing her out of revenge. After being released from prison, revisiting her relationship with Bo and repairing her relationships with Melanie and her daughter's father Daniel Jonas, Carly eventually got involved in keeping the secret of Chloe Lane's son. The child turned out to be the son of Chloe's ex- boyfriend Philip and not her husband Daniel (but later this was revealed to be untrue and the result of Caroline Brady switching the DNA results). After ruining the bonds she shared with everyone around her, including Bo who got back together with his wife Hope, Carly turned to drugs after falling in love with Daniel, and being distraught about his relationship with her best friend, Jennifer, and eventually entered rehab under the care of Dr. Norman. Following a reunion with Nicholas and renewing her relationships with those she hurt, Carly left town to travel Europe with her son. In late 2012, her daughter, Melanie, went to live with her in Europe. ==Reception== Throughout the character's run, Carly has remained one of the show's most popular characters, which is largely due to the storyline that saw her buried alive, which is attributed to the rise in ratings at the time the storyline aired. The storyline is often considered to be one of the most shocking plot lines in popular culture history. Chappell's popularity in the role led to her win the \\"Hottest Female Star\\" award at the 9th Soap Opera Digest Awards ceremony in 1993, at the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards she earned a daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2012. The character is also considered to be \\"the one true viable threat to super-duo Bo and Hope,\\" played by Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso, because her relationship with Bo has generated a large following and notable storylines and rivals that of the supercouple. When she made her long-awaited return in 2009, Chappell was thrust into a story surrounding Carly's biological daughter Melanie Jonas, played by Molly Burnett. Off-screen, Chappell became a friend and mentor to Burnett and at the time of her co-star's exit, Burnett said, \\"Crystal brings her A game every time she films a scene. So you want to bring yours to stay with her. She always inspired me to work really hard.\\" Chappell's professionalism is often noted by her colleagues on the shows she has appeared on, including Days of Our Lives actor Wally Kurth, Guiding Light and One Life to Live actress Jessica Leccia and writer Claire Labine who was instrumental in the creation of Chappell's storylines on GL and OLTL. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== *Days of Our Lives - Carly Manning *Carly Manning / Katerina Von Leuschner @ soapcentral.com Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Fictional physicians Category:Television characters introduced in 1990 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional female doctors ","title":"Carly Manning"},{"id":"12357095","text":"Prunus maackii, commonly called the Manchurian cherry or Amur chokecherry, is a species of cherry native to Korea and both banks of the Amur River, in Manchuria in northeastern China, and Amur Oblast and Primorye in southeastern Russia.Flora of China: Padus maackii Bark on a cultivated plant It is a deciduous tree growing to 4–10 m tall.

Tikhon appealed to the international religious community and soon some aid began to arrive. The Soviet government disliked this course of affairs, and Tikhon's Pomgol was disbanded on August 27, 1921. Instead, governmental Pomgol was established.Цыпин. В.

Bromwell (born March 9, 1949) is a former Democratic state senator in Maryland, United States. ==Background== Bromwell was first elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1979 to represent District 9 in Baltimore County and Baltimore City. In 1983, he successfully ran for the seat of District 8 in the Maryland State Senate. In 1986, Bromwell defeated Republican challenger Edward J. Glusing Jr., 73% to 27%. In 1990, Bromwell won a closer election, this time defeating Republican William Rush, 54% to 46%. The general election in 1994 was similar to 1990, and Bromwell defeated Republican John J. Bishop with 55% of the vote to Bishop's 45%. In 1998, Bromwell again faced William Rush, this time handily defeating his Republican challenger by capturing 68% of the vote to Rush's 32%. Bromwell resigned his seat in 2002 to head the Maryland Injured Workers' Insurance Fund or IWIF, a state agency. Governor Parris Glendening appointed John R. Schneider to replace Bromwell in District 8. Schneider died only two months after his appointment, and Governor Glendening then appointed Joseph T. Ferraracci to the seat. However, Ferraracci did not run for election in 2002. Katherine A. Klausmeier ran for the seat as a Democrat and won. ==Education== Bromwell attended Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. After high school, he received his associate degree in Business from Essex Community College, now known as one of the campuses of the Community Colleges of Baltimore County, in 1972. ==Career== Bromwell served a long and noted career in the Maryland State Senate. He was the chair of many committees over his career including the Finance Committee from 1995–2002, Workers' Compensation Benefit and Insurance Oversight Committee from 1987–1994, State Senate Rules Committee from 1991–1995, and the Baltimore County Delegation from 1985–1994. In addition to Bromwell's political career, he also owned and managed a construction company, Dallas Construction. In 2001, Federal prosecutors began secretly taping conversations with Bromwell when they suspected he was involved in racketeering. Bromwell paid the property manager of the Candler Building over $6000 to direct contract work to his company, Dallas Construction. In addition, Bromwell then directed work and benefits to W. David Stoffregen and his company, Poole and Kent. Bromwell reportedly received over $190,000 free construction at his million dollar shore front residence from Stoffregen. The case against Bromwell also indicated that he may have used his political power and influence to help get work for such projects as M&T; Bank Stadium and a new juvenile detention center. During the trial, Bromwell had more than one attorney. One of the lawyers fought to have some of the tapings removed from evidence. The recordings included Bromwell's profanity-ridden racial and sexual epithets, including barbs against the Lieutenant Governor. In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Bromwell, his wife Mary Patricia Bromwell, and Stoffregen. The claim of the lawsuit was that Bromwell's \\"Alleged Purpose of Scheme Was to Influence Thomas Bromwell in His Official Capacity as a Maryland State Senator\\". The 30-count indictment included conspiring to violation the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, wire fraud, mail fraud, and extortion. On October 31, 2005, Bromwell pleaded not-guilty to all charges. It was expected that he could be sentenced to up to 8 years in prison if found guilty. There was some criticism of First Mariner Bancorp because they continued to maintain Bromwell as a member of the Board of Directors. On November 16, 2007, Thomas Bromwell was sentenced to 7 years in prison by U.S. District Court Judge J. Frederick Motz. Meanwhile, Bromwell's wife was sentenced to a year and a day for collecting money for her no-show job. She served her sentence first, then Thomas Bromwell was released in February 2013 to a community reintegration program, with final release scheduled for August 2013. ==ReferencesExternal links== *http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/05sen/former/html/msa12134.html Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Maryland state senators Category:Members of the Maryland House of Delegates Category:Maryland Democrats Category:Politicians from Baltimore Category:Baltimore Polytechnic Institute alumni Category:Politicians convicted of racketeering Category:Maryland politicians convicted of crimes Category:Community College of Baltimore County alumni ","title":"Thomas L.

He earned the name Hassa when he was a toddler, from his cousin and future Melbourne footballer Len Mann. A centreman, Mann was recruited from Rutherglen, Victoria and made his debut for Melbourne in their premiership season of 1959. He was a premiership player again the following season and went on to become the club captain in 1965, a position he kept for four seasons. Mann finished in the top 10 of the Brownlow Medal count four times, including placing equal 7th in 1966 and equal 5th in 1967. He won Melbourne's Best and Fairest back to back in 1962 and 1963, and for a third time in 1967. He also twice topped their goalkicking, doing so as captain in 1967 and 1968. For his performance for Victoria in the 1966 Hobart Carnival he earned All- Australian selection. After finishing his VFL career in Victoria he became captain-coach at South Fremantle, in Western Australia in the WAFL, winning a best and fairest in his debut season and captain-coaching that club to a Premiership in his second year, 1970. Mann coached Caulfield in the Victorian Football Association in 1981, and he was coach of the 1982 Eltham premiership team.Eltham Captains & Coaches In 2000 he was named at the half forward flank in Melbourne's official 'Team of the Century'.

It is the first major Trilingual (English, Arabic & French) festival in North Africa. It focuses on cutting- edge contemporary Visual Art, Literature, and Film. It consists of a main Visual Arts Exhibition, other arts exhibitions, installations and happenings, discussions, debates and screenings based in the eclectic venues and settings that Marrakech has to offer. AiM is now known as Marrakech Biennale. == 1st Edition 2005 == The exhibition of the Wonderful Fund Collection opened AiM 2005 at the Museum of Marrakech. This collection of 100 works of contemporary art - purchased by Vanessa Branson and Prue O'Day as curators for the London- based collectors group, was exhibited for the first time ever at AiM. The collection was not put together as an investment, but as a platform for discovery and a means of supporting young artists. There were 64 artists representing 17 countries in the Collection and included work from artists such as Sarah Lucas, Grayson Perry, Jake & Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin and Gavin Turk. The Literary Programme was organised by Pablo Ganguli, highlights included a panel discussion on the future of English and literature and how the media can play a key role in its promotion, chaired by Geordie Greig with author Hanif Kureishi, Alexandra Pringle, Peter Florence, Simon Prosser, Ekow Eshun, Esther Freud, Antony Gormley, Annie Lennox and Hari Kunzru; and a conference on the importance of the translation of Arabic literature and poetry in the western world and a discussion on the state of Arab literature, featuring Ahmed El Madini, Rabii Mobarak, Susanna Nicklin, Wassini Laraj, Tayeb Salah and Mahi Binebine. == 2nd Edition 2007 == The 2007 festival bought together acclaimed writers, directors and artists from across Morocco and the world together in a rich forum of debate and cooperation.

The MB5 was attended by over 450 artists including more than 100 Moroccan artists, it had over 30,000 visitors. It mobilized more than 80 sponsors and patrons and invited over 150 international and national journalists and professionals. Thanks to an extensive programme, as well as the quality of the artists and media coverage, the event got ranked among the top 20 biennials in the world.  Visual Arts  Curated by Hicham Khalidi The exhibition, curated by Hicham Khalidi, invited 43 artists from Morocco and several other countries. The vast majority of the artworks were site specific, produced in and inspired by the context of Marrakech. The artpieces were diffused between the venues of the 16th century El Badi Palace, the Dar Si Said, which houses the Museum of Moroccan Arts, the former Bank Al Maghrib in the middle of the Jemaa El Fna square - This square is the pulsing heart of the Medina of Marrakech, and it has been defined by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity- and a unique art deco building in the area of Gueliz called L'Blasa, Which is now the headquarters of the 6th edition of the Marrakech Biennale in 2016. v12 laraki, in Bank Almaghrib, by artist Eric Van Hove, for MB5 'Singing Maps and Underlying Melodies' curated by Clara Meister in collaboration with S.T.I.F.F., KamarStudios and Moroccan musicians.

With the participation of the pioneering founder of the festival of video installation Casaprojecta, Jamal Abdenassar, video installation as a hyphen between film, visual art, and performing art was very present in this edition. The film screenings and roundtables were combined by a carte blanche to the legendary Cinematheque de Tanger.

Photo: Mahdi Messouli Led by the Moroccan writer and theater author Driss Ksikès, the Literary discipline promoted access to public space through a series of roundtables as well as performative lectures, connecting performing art and literature. These events took place in the Royal Theater, a contested theater and opera house built in the late 70s yet never used as such. Playing on this, it was also the main venue of the previous edition of the Marrakech Biennale. The literature section also took place in Riad Denise Masson, the house of the first woman who ever translated the Koran into French and Dar Cherifa, the oldest house of the Medina. Finally, the exhibition opened to the most public space of the city as it merges with the visual art exhibition in the main square Jemaa El Fna, fusing the new and the old.

He created a circulation that reimagines the relationships of public space to both outsiders and natives between several venues of the Biennale. This movement is organized as a dialogue between the contemporary and the traditional, connecting the two areas where the Biennale took place: the more traditional space of the Medina and the modern area of Gueliz, the first area built outside of the Medina fortification starting in 1913. The main purpose of this circulation in the public space is to invite the immediate and spontaneous audience to participate in the Biennale by interconnecting the main venues.

Kī-o-rahi is a ball sport played in New Zealand with a small round ball called a 'kī'. It is a fast-paced game incorporating skills similar to rugby union, netball and touch.Shane Gilchrist, 'Game on, the \\"ki\\" is back in court' , Otago Daily Times, 5 October 2007 Two teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target. The game is played with varying rules (e.g. number of people, size of field, tag ripping rules etc.) depending on the geographic area it is played in. A process called Tatu, before the game, determines which rules the two teams will use. In 2005 kī-o-rahi was chosen to represent New Zealand by global fast-food chain McDonald's as part of its 'Passport to Play' programme to teach physical play activities in 31,000 American schools. The programme will give instruction in 15 ethnic games to seven million primary school children. The New Zealand kī-o-rahi representative organisation, Kī-o-Rahi Akotanga Iho, formed with men's and women's national teams, completed a 14 match tour of Europe in September and October 2010. The men's team included 22-test All Black veteran Wayne Shelford who led the team to a 57–10 test win against Kī- o-Rahi Dieppe Organisation, the French Kī-o-Rahi federation. Shelford's kī-o- rahi test jersey made him the first kī-o-rahi/rugby double international for NZ. The women's team coached by Andrea Cameron (Head of PE at Tikipunga High School) also won by 33–0. These were the first historic test matches between NZ and France. ==Origins== Although former chief executive of the Māori Language Commission, Dr. Patu Hohepa, a noted Māori academic, was quoted as saying \\"We cannot track it in the traditional Maori world... at this present time it is a mystery.\\" Nonetheless he found the idea (that this was a traditional game) \\"fabulously exciting\\". According to Henry Anderson, kaiwhakahaere (Māori sport co-ordinator) for Sport Northland, kī-o-rahi is a traditional Māori game that has been \\"handed down over the centuries\\". Harko Brown, a physical education teacher at Kerikeri High School, who was taught the game in the late 1970s on his marae in the south Waikato, described it as \\"an indigenous game imbued with tikanga Māori with a very long history ... of a pre-European nature.\\" References to the ancient forms of the game can be found in his book Nga Taonga Takaro. It is not clear when the term 'kī-o-rahi' originated as a collective term for ancient ball games played around a tupu. It is said to be based on the legend of Rahitutakahina and the rescue of his wife, Tiarakurapakewai. ==References== Category:Māori culture Category:Māori sport Category:Ball games Category:Traditional football Category:Māori words and phrases ","title":"Kī-o-rahi"},{"id":"12357222","text":"Structure of [Ru(NH3)5(N2)]2+. Ball-and-stick model of ReCl(dppe)2N2 Transition metal dinitrogen complexes are coordination compounds that contain transition metals as ion centers the dinitrogen molecules (N2) as ligands. == Historical background == Transition metal complexes of N2 have been studied since 1965 when the first complex was reported by Allen and Senoff. This diamagnetic complex, [Ru(NH3)5(N2)]2+, was synthesized from hydrazine hydrate and ruthenium trichloride and consists of a 16e− [Ru(NH3)5]2+ centre attached to one end of N2. N2 as a ligand in this compounds was identified by IR spectrum with a strong band around 2170–2100 cm−1. In 1966, the molecular structure of [Ru(NH3)5(N2)]Cl2 was determined by Bottomly and Nyburg by X-ray crystallography. The dinitrogen complex trans-[IrCl(N2)(PPh3)2] is made by treating Vaska's complex with aromatic acyl azides. It has a planar geometry. The first preparation of a metal-dinitrogen complex using dinitrogen was reported in 1967 by Yamamoto and coworkers. They obtained Co[H(N2)(PPh3)3] by reduction of Co(acac)3 with AlEt2OEt under an atmosphere of N2. Containing both hydrido and N2 ligands, the complex was of potential relevance to nitrogen fixation. From the late 1960s, a variety of transition metal- dinitrogen complexes were made including those with iron, molybdenum and vanadium as metal centers. Interest in such complexes arises because N2 comprises the majority of the atmosphere and because many useful compounds contain nitrogen. Biological nitrogen fixation probably occurs via the binding of N2 to those metal centers in the enzyme nitrogenase, followed by a series of steps that involve electron transfer and protonation. ==Bonding modes== In terms of its bonding to transition metals, N2 is related to CO and acetylene as all three species have triple bonds. A variety of bonding modes have been characterized. Based on whether the N2 molecules are shared by two more metal centers, the complexes can be classified into mononuclear and bridging. Based on the geometric relationship between the N2 molecule and the metal center, the complexes can be classified into end-on or side-on modes. In the end-on bonding modes of transition metal-dinitrogen complexes, the N-N vector can be considered in line with the metal ion center, whereas in the side-on modes, the metal-ligand bond is known to be perpendicular to the N-N vector. Mononuclear, end-on As a ligand, N2 usually binds to metals as an \\"end- on\\" ligand, as illustrated by [Ru(NH3)5N2]2+. Such complexes are usually analogous to related CO derivatives. This relationship is illustrated by the pair of complexes IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2 and IrCl(N2)(PPh3)2. In these mononuclear cases, N2 is both as a σ-donor and a π-acceptor. The M-N-N bond angles are close to 180°. N2 is a weaker pi-acceptor than CO, reflecting the nature of the π* orbitals on CO vs N2. For this reason, few examples exist of complexes containing both CO and N2 ligand. Transition metal-dinitrogen complexes can contain more than one N2 as \\"end-on\\" ligands, such as mer-[Mo(N2)3(PPrn2Ph)3], which has octahedral geometry. In another example, the dinitrogen ligand in Mo(N2)2(Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2)2 can be reduced to produce ammonia.Modern Coordination Chemistry: The Legacy of Joseph Chatt\\" G. J. Leigh, N. W. Winterton Springer Verlag (2002). Because many nitrogenases contain Mo, there has been particular interest in Mo-N2 complexes. Bridging, end-on N2 also serves as a bridging ligand with \\"end-on\\" bonding to two metal centers, as illustrated by {[Ru(NH3)5]2(μ-N2)}4+. These complexes are also called multinuclear dinitrogen complexes. In contrast to their mononuclear counterpart, they can be prepared for both early and late transition metals. In 2006, a study of iron-dinitrogen complexes by Holland and coworkers showed that the N–N bond is significantly weakened upon complexation with iron atoms with a low coordination number. The complex involved bidentate chelating ligands attached to the iron atoms in the Fe–N–N–Fe core, in which N2 acts as a bridging ligand between two iron atoms. Increasing the coordination number of iron by modifying the chelating ligands and adding another ligand per iron atom showed an increase in the strength of the N–N bond in the resulting complex. It is thus suspected that Fe in a low-coordination environment is a key factor to the fixation of nitrogen by the nitrogenase enzyme, since its Fe–Mo cofactor also features Fe with low coordination numbers. The average bond length of those bridging-end-on dinitrogen complexes are about 1.2 Å. Within some cases, the bond length can be as long as 1.4 Å, which is similar to those of N-N single bonds.  Mononuclear, side-on  In comparison with their end-on counterpart, the mononuclear side-on dinitrogen complexes are usually higher in energy and the examples of them are rare. Dinitrogen act as a π-donor in these type of complexes. Fomitchev and Coppens has reported the first crystallographic evidence for side-on coordination of N2 to a single metal center in a photoinduced metastable state. When treated with UV light, the transition metal-dinitrogen complex, [Os(NH3)5(N2)]2+ in solid states can be converted into a metastable state of [Os(NH3)5(η2-N2)]2+, where the vibration of dinitrogen has shifted from 2025 to 1831 cm−1. Some other examples are considered to exist in the transition states of intramolecular linkage isomerizations. Armor and Taube has reported these isomerizations using 15N-labelled dinitrogen as ligands. Bridging, side-on In a second mode of bridging, bimetallic complexes are known wherein the N-N vector is perpendicular to the M-M vector, which can be considered as side-on fashion. One example is [(η5-C5Me4H)2Zr]2(μ2,η2,η2-N2). The dimetallic complex can react with H2 to achieve the artificial nitrogen fixation by reducing N2. A related ditantalum tetrahydride complex could also reduce N2. ==Reactivity== Hypothesized cycle for M-catalysed nitrogen fixation according to Chatt et al. Some metal-dintrogen complexes catalyze the hydrogenation of N2 to ammonia. One such catalyst is the Mo(III) triamidoaminocomplex Mo[(HIPTN)3N]. This system utilizes reductants such as Cp*2Cr and protonating reagents such as 2,6-lutidinium salts. The reducing equivalents and protons are added stepwise. The cycle begins with N2 coordinated to Mo in an end-on fashion. The oxidation state of molybdenum remains unchanged until the last step when it is oxidized from Mo(III) to Mo(IV). For the rest of the cycle, dinitrogen is bound to Mo via a double or a triple bond accompanied by the change in oxidation state of Mo from +4 to +5 and the release of 2 equivalents of ammonia gas. In another homogeneous catalytic system based on molybdenum the precatalyst is a dinitrogen-bridged dimolybdenum complex bearing PNP(2,6-bis(di-tert-butyl phosphinomethyl) pyridine) ligand. Adding acids to the precatalyst leads to the splitting of dinitrogen bridged dimolybdenum complex and generates an inactive molybdenum hydride cation and an active molybdenum nitrogen adduct MoPNP(N2). The latter MoPNP(N2) can then undergo a full catalytic cycle with the proton and the electron addition to form ammonia. However this catalytic system needs a large excess of cobaltocene (72 equiv) and [LutH]OTf (96 equiv). ==References== Category:Nitrogen compounds Category:Coordination chemistry ","title":"Transition metal dinitrogen complex"},{"id":"12357246","text":"The Athlete's Foot (TAF) is a global retailer of athletic inspired footwear, apparel and accessories.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and after that served in the Soviet Navy as T-282. She was converted to a naval trawler in 1948 and renamed Shkval. ==Construction and commissioning== Rampart was laid down on 24 November 1943 at Chickasaw, Alabama, by the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 30 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Frank S. Scott, and commissioned on 18 November 1944 with Lieutenant Stanley F. Luce in command. ==Service history== U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945 After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, Rampart got underway on 8 December 1944 and arrived at Little Creek, Virginia, on 13 December 1944. She operated out of Little Creek, conducting minesweeping exercises, until 15 January 1945, when she left bound for Casco Bay, Maine, for antisubmarine warfare training. Rampart then returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, and got underway on 25 January 1945 for the Panama Canal Zone, reaching Coco Solo Naval Base on 1 February 1945. She transited the Panama Canal and proceeded to San Diego, California, before moving on Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, where she arrived on 24 February 1945. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Territory of Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against JapanRussell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. - Rampart departed Pearl Harbor on 7 March 1945 in company with three other ships earmarked for Project Hula - her sister ship and the auxiliary motor minesweepers and Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: Fancy - bound for Seattle, Washington, which they reached on 19 March 1945. On 7 April 1945, Rampart departed Seattle for Kodiak, Alaska. On 14 April 1945, she left Kodiak for Cold Bay, where she arrived on 15 April 1945. She began shakedown training with her new Soviet Navy crew on 24 April 1945, which was completed on 13 May 1945. Soviet Navy, 1945-1960 Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Rampart was decommissioned on 21 May 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-282' in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviets converted T-282 into a naval trawler in 1948 and renamed her Shkval, and never returned her to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-282 on 7 February 1955. ==Disposal== The ship was scrapped in 1960. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Rampart on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983. == References == * * Category:Admirable-class minesweepers Category:Ships built in Chickasaw, Alabama Category:1944 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United States Category:Admirable-class minesweepers of the Soviet Navy Category:World War II minesweepers of the Soviet Union Category:Cold War minesweepers of the Soviet Union Category:Trawlers of the Soviet Navy Category:Cold War patrol vessels of the Soviet Union Category:Ships transferred under Project Hula ","title":"USS Rampart (AM-282)"},{"id":"12357249","text":"Bromwell is a surname.

The route runs . The entire length of the route is an old routing of US-6 and US-50; a portion of the route was also US-91. These routes were re-aligned or truncated after the Interstate Highway System was constructed through this part of Utah. ==Route description== From its western terminus at Interstate 15 in Santaquin, the route heads north-northeast until reaching Payson, where it straightens out to the north. This portion of the route is 100 West in Payson. Soon after, the highway turns east on State Road. The highway veers northeast and eventually to the north-northeast until Spanish Fork, where it runs north again. The route turns east on Canyon Road, eventually turning to the southeast until reaching US-6, where it terminates. The brief portion of SR-198 between the SR-164 and SR-156 junctions is listed on the National Highway System. ==History== The roads from Santaquin northeast to Spanish Fork and Spanish Fork southeast to Moark Junction were added to the state highway system in the early 1910s.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008 In the 1920s, the former back part of SR-1 and US-91, and the latter part of SR-8 and US-89.Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926American Association of State Highway Officials, United States Numbered Highways, American Highways, April 1927 The state route designation of the latter portion, which had since become signed as US-6, was changed from SR-8 to State Route 105 in 1945.

Wendover Boulevard was originally part of U.S. Route 40 (US 40), which connected California to New Jersey via Nevada and Utah. A portion of the Nevada segment is concurrent with U.S. Route 93 Alternate (US 93 Alt.), and the entire portion in Utah is coterminous with Utah State Route 58 (SR-58). The Nevada Department of Transportation (Nevada DOT) applied for the business loop designation in the early 1980s but the designation has never been approved; nevertheless, signs are posted in both states. Between July 1976 and 1993, BL-80 was concurrent with State Route 224 (SR 224) in Nevada. ==Route description== Starting at the easternmost Nevada exit of I-80, BL-80 heads south along Florence Way, concurrent with US 93 Alt. until it intersects with, and turns east onto, Wendover Boulevard. Just west of the intersection, the highway passes the West Wendover City Hall, which houses the West Wendover Municipal Court and Eastline Justice Court. Traveling east along Wendover Boulevard, BL-80 passes by the Peppermill casino, the West Wendover Visitors Center and Scobie Park. US 93 Alt. turns south towards Ely, while BL-80 continues east until it reaches the Montego Bay Resort and Wendover Nugget casinos. The casinos are connected via a sky bridge that allows pedestrian access between the hotels without crossing the highway. A line painted on the street marks the Nevada–Utah border. At the border, BL-80 becomes coterminous with Utah State Route 58 for the final stretch through Wendover, Utah. alt=A five-lane asphalt highway BL-80 continues to the east past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road. The Utah segment of BL-80 is codified into Utah law as Utah Code §72-4-111. Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. In 2009, UDOT calculated that an average of 2,370 vehicles per day traveled on BL-80 at the state line. This is a significant decrease from the traffic counts earlier in the decade, which measured 11,205 vehicles in 2006, 10,345 in 2005, and 13,840 in 2004. Twenty-one percent of this traffic consists of trucks. ==History== A roadway, now named Wendover Boulevard, has existed since June 23, 1925, when the Victory Highway was completed through Wendover. Then governors George H. Dern of Utah and James G. Scrugham of Nevada, as well as the Secretary of Agriculture William M. Jardine were present to open the highway. Bill Smith and Herman Eckstein opened a filling station at the present location of the Wendover Nugget Casino at a cost of $500 early in 1926 (equivalent to $ in ). To welcome travelers to his station, he installed a light bulb at the top of a tall pole, which served as the only light in the desert. The earlier Lincoln Highway was re-routed to follow the Victory Highway through the region by an order of the Lincoln Highway Association executive committee on October 18, 1926. Wendover Boulevard was numbered US 40 through what are now the cities of West Wendover and Wendover beginning in 1926. US 40 was the major thoroughfare between San Francisco, in the west, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the east. US 40 was routed along the Wendover Cut-off, now known as Frontage Road, which was retained as a service road after the completion of the I-80. The US 40 designation was removed by 1976 or 1977, when I-80 was completed through the area. The designation of roadway now numbered US 93 Alt. has changed twice in the past. Between 1932 and 1953, it was designated US 50, and between 1954 and either 1978 and 1979, it was designated US 50 Alt. BL-80 in West Wendover, Nevada, traveling east approaching the Utah state line Two other roads have been numbered Utah SR-58 in the past. The first route designated SR-58 was formed in 1945 between SR-36 and Clover, but was decommissioned in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between I-15 in New Harmony back to I-15 via Kanarraville, but that road was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between the state line and the junction with Frontage Road, which was formerly US 40. Wendover Boulevard between US 93 Alt. and the state line was designated SR 224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County. Even though BL-80 is signed in both Nevada and Utah, the route has never been officially designated a business loop by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) or by the Utah State Legislature. Nevada DOT applied for the designation, but in July 1982 the application was deferred by AASHTO until Utah submitted a request for a business loop. No such request has ever been submitted. Prior to 2007, BL-80 was the only connection to the city of Wendover from Utah. However, a new partial diamond interchange, which allows traffic from I-80 to exit going westbound and for traffic to enter I-80 eastbound, at Aria Boulevard was constructed. The Aria Boulevard interchange was first planned in 2005, and was completed without using any federal funding. In 2007, the City of West Wendover had two historical markers installed along BL-80, one at the state line, and the other at the intersection of US 93 Alt. to commemorate the Victory Highway and US 40. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * Interstate 80 Business (Nevada) for other Business Routes of Interstate 80 in Nevada ==ReferencesExternal links== * AARoads: Business Loop I-80 – Wendover / West Wendover Business (West Wendover, Nevada–Wendover, Utah) Category:U.S. Route 40 Category:Transportation in Elko County, Nevada Category:Transportation in Tooele County, Utah Category:West Wendover, Nevada Category:Streets in Utah 80 Business (West Wendover, Nevada–Wendover, Utah) 80 Business (West Wendover) 80 Business (Wendover) ","title":"Interstate 80 Business (West Wendover, Nevada–Wendover, Utah)"},{"id":"12357301","text":"Christiana Drummond Morgan (born Christiana Drummond Councilman; 1897–1967) was an artist, writer and lay psychoanalyst at Harvard University best known for her work co-authoring the Thematic Apperception Test, one of the most widely used projective psychological tests. She was the lover of American psychologist Henry Murray, who commissioned Gaston Lachaise to make a nude portrait statue of her. Morgan was an alcoholic and died under unclear circumstances age 69. == Early life and education== Christiana was born Drummond Councilman in Boston, Massachusetts on October 6, 1897. She attended Miss Winsor's school for girls in Boston from 1908 to 1914 and later a boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut.Weber, Michel, \\"Christiana Morgan (1897–1967),\\" in Michel Weber and William Desmond, Jr. (eds.), Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought, Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2008, v. II, pp. 465–468. In 1917, as a 20 year old in Boston society she met William Otho Potwin Morgan (1895–1934). He enlisted to fight in World War I and went abroad. Morgan trained as nurse aid at the YWCA in New York City and served as a nurse during the 1918 flu pandemic.Staff Test Developer Profiles: Christiana Morgan Copyright 2001 The McGraw-Hill Companies. Upon his return in 1919 they married and moved into 985 Memorial Drive in Cambridge -the same building, in which a few years later, the British mathematician philosopher Alfred North Whitehead and his wife would live as well. From 1921 to 1924 Morgan studied art at the Art Students League of New York with Frank DuMond, Guy Pène du Bois, and Leo Lentelli. == Professional career == Morgan was an artist, writer, and lay psychoanalyst fascinated by depth psychology. Part of the Introvert/Extrovert Club in New York City in the 1920s, she traveled to Zurich to consult Carl Jung. When Jung met Morgan, he considered her the manifestation of the perfect feminine, une femme inspiratrice whose role was to act as a muse to great men. Jung conducted a seminar, called the \\"Vision Seminars\\", analyzing Morgan's many drawings and dreams. She created mythic visions chronicling \\"her struggle with the feminine and masculine forces in her world\\". In a new Hebrew-language biography of Chaim Weizmann, Motti Golani and Jehuda Reinharz cite documents showing that in 1921 Christiana Morgan had a liaison with Weizmann. In 1923, she met and fell in love with Henry Murray, then biochemist at Rockefeller University NY, later psychology professor at Harvard University. He was married 7 years, and did not want to leave his wife. As Murray experienced a serious conflict, Morgan advised him to visit Jung. In 1927, they visited Jung in Zürich, and upon his advice became lovers \\"to unlock their unconscious and their creativity\\". In 1934, Morgan co- developed the Thematic Apperception Test with Murray, a projective psychological test to elicit fantasy still used today. It consists of a series of pictures shown to a person who is asked to make up a story about each picture; in its early development, many of Morgan's own drawings were included. She was first author with Henry Murray in the first publication of the test,Morgan, C. D., & Murray, H. A. (1935). A method of investigating fantasies: The Thematic Apperception Test. Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, 34, 289–306. and as late as 1941 the test was known as the \\"Morgan-Murray Thematic Apperception Test\\" .White, R. W., Sanford, R. N, Murray, H. A., & Bellak, L. (1941, September). Morgan-Murray Thematic Apperception Test: Manual of directions [mimeograph]. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Psychological Clinic. (Harvard University Archives, HUGFP 97.43.2, Box 5 of 7) When the current version of the test was published by the Harvard University Press in 1943, authorship was attributed to \\"Henry A. Murray, M.D., and the Staff of the Harvard Psychological Clinic.\\" As it was further developed, Morgan's pictures were taken out as well as her co-authorship. Murray stated 1985, \\"Morgan asked to have her name removed as senior author of the 1943/1971 TAT because she disliked the obligation of making the academic responses\\". Morgan administered one of the earliest versions of the test to one of the first diagnosed anorexic patients in Boston. == Death == After a radical sympathectomy surgery for high blood pressure and years of excessive drinking, Morgan died at the age of 69 at Denis Bay, Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands on March 14, 1967. Murray found her body near the beach, drowned in less than two feet of water. There is controversy over her death related to Murray's conflicting accounts, and suspicions that Morgan may have died of suicide. ==Legacy== The Thematic Apperception Test is one of the most widely used projective psychological tests to date. Murray had commissioned Gaston Lachaise to create a nude portrait statue of Morgan. It is now owned by the Governor's Academy, in Byfield, Massachusetts as is Morgan Tower, formerly her residence on the Parker River adjacent to the Governor's campus.Budny, V.

The route runs twenty miles (32 km) and is the old routing of U.S. Route 50 Alternate and U.S. Route 40. ==Route description== From its western terminus at exit 84 of I-80, northeast of the Stansbury Mountains, the route heads southwest (toward the mountain range), reaching the mining operation of Flux, then turns southeasterly. Upon entering the western side of Grantsville, the highway heads east (serving as Grantsville's Main Street) and turns to the northeast after leaving the city. It runs northeasterly until terminating at Mills Junction north of Stansbury Park, at milepost 62.9 of Highway 36. With the exception of the segment between SR-112 and Sheep Lane, the route is included in the National Highway System. ==History== Previous route When it was first formed in 1933, SR-138 took a similar path to the present-day route, going from Grantsville north to Burmester. This designation was deleted in 1953. Current route The current route of SR-138 was formed in 1965, when SR-2 was moved to the north to reflect the future alignment of then under-construction I-80. The state legislature wanted to keep the old alignment of looping down to Grantsville in the state highway system, so it was re-designated as SR-138. This designation has remained the same since that action. In the May 2018 meeting of the Utah Transportation Commission, a motion passed to truncate the east end SR-138 to the future Tooele Midvalley Highway (SR-179). However, this is contingent on the completion of the segment of SR-179 between SR-138 and I-80, which has not begun construction. ==Major intersectionsReferences== 138 138 Utah State Route 138 Utah State Route 138 Utah State Route 138 ","title":"Utah State Route 138"},{"id":"12357320","text":"Gaetano Merola (4 January 1881 - 30 August 1953) was an Italian conductor, pianist and founder of the San Francisco Opera. ==Biography== Merola was born in Naples, the son of a Neapolitan court violinist and studied piano and conductor at the Naples conservatory. He emigrated to the United States in 1899 and served as an assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Henry Wilson Savage's opera company in Boston, and Fortune Gallo's traveling San Carlo Opera Company. Oscar Hammerstein I hired Merola as choral conductor of his Manhattan Opera Company where Merola remained until the company folded in 1910. He then served as conductor in Hammerstein's London Opera House before returning to New York as an operetta conductor. Merola conducted the premieres of several shows, including Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta, Rudolf Friml's The Firefly and Sigmund Romberg's Maytime. San Francisco years It was while touring with the San Carlo Opera that Merola began making annual visits to San Francisco. He first heard Luisa Tetrazzini, a recent arrival to America, at the city's Tivoli Opera House in 1904 and recommended her to Hammerstein. San Francisco had had a long history of opera houses dating back to the Gold Rush. Recognizing the city's potential as a major opera center, Merola decided to stay in the Bay Area and launched his first company in 1923 with a summer season of Carmen, I Pagliacci and Faust at the Stanford University football stadium where over 30,000 attended. Though that first season resulted in a deficit, he pressed on the next year, adapting the Civic Auditorium to his purposes. He recruited some 2,000 individuals and local businesses to become Founders of his opera company. By 1927, he presented the local premieres of Tristan und Isolde and the then-new Turandot, and in the following years, he introduced Falstaff, La Fanciulla del West and Die Meistersinger. War Memorial Opera House For years, the local citizenry had spoken of building a new opera house. The aftermath of World War I had also kindled a desire to honor the city's war heroes with a veteran's building or art museum. Eventually, those ideas coalesced into a joint project that was to consist of two Palladian-style edifices. One building would house an art museum with veterans rooms while the other would be home to Merola's San Francisco Opera. Two lots across from City Hall were appropriated for the construction, and a bond issue was approved by the voters in 1927. By October 1931, when the twin cornerstones were laid, the stock market crash and ensuing Depression had significantly reduced the construction costs, and the two buildings were completed within the year for US$5.5 million. The War Memorial Opera House opened on October 15, 1932 with an inaugural production of Tosca starring Claudia Muzio and Dino Borgioli (a primitive recording of Act 1 has survived, and is included in the Romophone Muzio series), followed a few days later by a charming 27-year-old Lily Pons in Lucia di Lammermoor. With a new house, Merola's company grew rapidly in its first decade, producing its first Richard Wagner Ring Cycle in 1935 starring Kirsten Flagstad (in her first complete Ring anywhere) and Lauritz Melchior, and introducing conductors Fritz Reiner in 1936 and Erich Leinsdorf in 1938. Part of Merola's southern strategy was to augment his company's home season with run-out performances at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. He had been a partner in the formation of Los Angeles Grand Opera, which had a successful run from 1924 to 1931. With the opening of the War Memorial in October 1932, Merola entered into a business agreement with the Los Angeles arts impresario L.E. Behymer to present stars of the San Francisco Opera in an abbreviated season of locally produced operas. So it was that L.A. audiences heard Muzio and Bonelli in La traviata and Il trovatore and Pons in Lucia and Rigoletto just days before their War Memorial debuts. Other notable productions included The Bartered Bride with Elisabeth Rethberg and an immense Le Coq d'Or in 1934. In 1937, Merola shed all pretense of a Los Angeles company and formally established a long-running series of annual visits by the San Francisco Opera Association to the Shrine Auditorium. That first season included Lauritz Melchior and Kirsten Flagstad in Tristan und Isolde conducted by Fritz Reiner, Melchior in Lohengrin, Pons and Ezio Pinza in Lakmé, Gina Cigna and Giovanni Martinelli in Aida and Maria Jeritza in Tosca. The result was an unbroken string of yearly Los Angeles performances through 1965. Later years In 1943, Merola brought Kurt Herbert Adler to San Francisco to serve as conductor, choral director and chief deputy. Adler had been Toscanini's assistant at Salzburg in 1936 and had arrived in the United States in 1938. Merola also continued to attract important new singers - often before they'd performed in other major American opera houses. Notable singers he introduced after the Second World War included Tito Gobbi, Ferruccio Tagliavini, Elena Nikolaidi, Renata Tebaldi and Mario del Monaco. As his health and energy declined over the next decade, Merola turned over more and more of his duties to Adler, though he remained at the helm of the company until his death in 1953 - an impressive stewardship of 30 years. He died while conducting an excerpt from Puccini's Madama Butterfly during a concert at Sigmund Stern Grove, an outdoor amphitheatre in western San Francisco where free summer concerts have been given since 1938. ==Merola Opera Program== Upon succeeding Merola as general director, Kurt Herbert Adler established the San Francisco Opera's training program for gifted singers and directors during the 1954-55 season. In 1957, the program was officially named the Merola Opera Program in honor of the company's founder and longtime general director, Gaetano Merola. The Merola Opera Program provides intensive training, coaching and master classes for eleven weeks every summer with established professionals in the various operatic fields, and its many graduates have gone on to important careers in opera. ==References== * ==External links== *SF Opera History *Merola Opera Program Alumni Category:1881 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Italian male conductors (music) Category:Opera managers Category:Musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:20th-century Italian conductors (music) Category:20th-century Italian male musicians Category:Musicians from Naples ","title":"Gaetano Merola"},{"id":"12357337","text":"EECA may refer to: *Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (New Zealand) *European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association *Eastern Europe and Central Asia *Emerging Europe and Central Asia ","title":"EECA"},{"id":"12357344","text":"Craig Zadan (April 15, 1949 – August 20, 2018) was an American producer and writer.

The EECA was set up by the Fourth National Government of New Zealand in 1992 to encourage, support and promote energy efficiency, energy conservation, and the use of renewable sources of energy. The EECA, by promoting energy efficiency, helps to reduce climate change and GHG emissions through energy efficiency measures. ==History== In 2000 EECA became a Crown entity, established under the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000. It is subject to the Crown Entities Act 2004. The passing of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act meant that for the first time, New Zealand had a legislative basis for promoting energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is responsible for preparing a national energy efficiency and conservation strategy for approval by the administering Minister. ==Home grants== In 2004, EECA launched the Energywise Home Grants Programme to provide insulation retrofits to low-income owners of homes built before 1978. That year, minimum insulation standards were introduced to the New Zealand building code, and the majority of homes built prior to this had no insulation at all. The Energywise Programme had a target of insulating 6000 homes. In 2009 the New Zealand Government allocated an extra $247.7 million to EECA for home insulation grants. The programme was called Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart and insulated more than 235,000 homes. In 2013, the Government allocated $100 million of operating funding over three years to the Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes programme, targeting low-income households for home insulation, particularly households occupied by children and/or the elderly. ==Leadership== As at 2013 Tom Campbell is the chair of the EECA Board.

The genus contains species known from Late Triassic-age rocks of the southwestern United States and northwestern Argentina. It is described as most closely related to the earlier Lagerpeton of Argentina, but was found among remains of true dinosaurs like Chindesaurus, indicating that the first dinosaurs did not immediately replace related groups. Based on the study of the overlapping material of Dromomeron and Tawa hallae, Christopher Bennett proposed that the two taxa were conspecific, forming a single growth series of Dromomeron. However, noting prominent differences between their femurs which cannot be attributed to variation with age, Rodrigo Muller rejected this proposal in 2017. He further noted that, while D. romeri is known from juveniles only, it shares many traits in common with D. gigas, which is known from mature specimens. == Description == It is known from partial remains, largely from the hindlimbs, which indicate an animal with an overall length of 1 meters (3.3 ft).Estimate after the scale diagram at the article's press fact sheet. == Classification == The bones of Dromomeron are most similar to those of the older dinosauromorph Lagerpeton, and the two animals have been classified together in a clade Lagerpetonidae.Baron, M.G., Norman, D.B., and Barrett, P.M. (2017). A new hypothesis of dinosaur relationships and early dinosaur evolution. Nature, 543: 501–506. Cladogram simplified after Kammerer, Nesbitt & Shubin (2012): == Discovery and species ==  Dromomeron romeri  The species name romeri honors influential 20th-century vertebrate paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer. Dromomeron and type species D. romeri are based on GR 218, a complete left thigh bone from the Hayden Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico. The rocks there are in the lower portion of the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, and are Norian in age. Additional hindlimb bones, some probably from the same individual, are also known, and a partial skeleton has been recovered from Hayden Quarry, but has not yet been fully prepared. A few other specimens have been recovered from nearby localities, including the Snyder Quarry. Other specimens from the Chinle Formation of Arizona and a roughly contemporaneous part of the Dockum Group of Texas also have been assigned to this genus. These have been assigned to a second species D. gregorii, named in 2009.  Dromomeron gregorii  D. gregorii, named for Joseph T. Gregory, is based on TMM 31100–1306, a right femur (thigh bone) from the Otis Chalk Quarry, Colorado City Formation, (Dockum Group), near Otis Chalk, Texas. Several other limb bones from the quarry, and a partial femur (thigh bone) from the Placerias Quarry of eastern Arizona have been assigned to this species. The rocks that D. gregorii is known from are older than those romeri has been found in. As with the Hayden Quarry, the Otis Chalk Quarry has at least one specimen of a herrerasaurid.  Dromomeron gigas  A third species, D. gigas, was described by Martínez et al. (2016) on the basis of fossils recovered from the Norian Quebrada del Barro Formation in northwestern Argentina. == Paleoecology == Also found at the Hayden Quarry are the remains of phytosaurs, aetosaurs, rauisuchians, and several types of dinosaurs and dinosaur relatives, including a Silesaurus-like animal, the herrerasaurid Chindesaurus, and the basal theropod Tawa. Finding the remains of four types of dinosaurs and dinosaur relatives (including Dromomeron itself) is noteworthy because it shows that dinosaurs did not immediately replace their dinosauromorph predecessors; that some of these groups, like the lagerpetonids, persisted (for longer than previously known) and diversified; and that dinosaurian replacement may have occurred at different times in different areas. == References  External links == * Online supplementary material for the Irmis et al.. article (PDF). * A fact sheet for the Irmis et al.. article.

It is found only in Mexico. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, and ponds. It is threatened by habitat loss and overcropping along with the scaling of their skins. == Early life == Ambystoma granulosum is subject to high mortality rates in early stages of development in nature due to insufficient nutrition and anthropogenic factors such as contamination and habitat degradation. The larvae display distinct changes in feeding patterns with increasing age, preferring smaller prey (e.g., A. glabra) in early larval stages and larger prey (e.g., S. vetulus and D. pulex) in later weeks. Low natural availability of prey in the wild lead to food deficiencies and increased early stage mortality. ==Distribution== The species is endemic to a small area of central Mexico close to and just to the northwest of Toluca in Mexico State, at an altitude of around .

It is endemic to a very small area of land in the Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park on the border of the State of Mexico with Puebla, with a single known population on Mount Tlaloc. Its very specific requirements as regards water quality militates against its survival in a habitat where water is being extracted, cattle graze and the salamander has traditionally been eaten as food. It has been listed as a threatened species by the Mexican Government and as \\"critically endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ==Distribution== This species is endemic to the Sierra Nevada in central Mexico. It was historically restricted to six locations in the Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park (IPNP) located on the border of the State of Mexico with Puebla. Long ago it disappeared from the heavily polluted Rio Frio where it was first found. A recent research rediscovered a new and relict locality of A. leorae, possibly the last one (Sunny et al. 2014a). The new study reports that the critically endangered species persists in a single population on Mount Tlaloc, located adjacent to Mexico City, one of the largest and most densely urbanized area on earth. ==Habitat== The salamanders were found in two small streams (2 m wide, 6.5 m depth) with cold water temperature (12 to 15 °C), highly elevated oxygenation water level (78% dissolved oxygen) surrounded by small alpine grassland (Muhlenbergia sp.) and mountain forest (Pinus hartwegii and Abies religiosa). The study show low genetic diversity but high average heterozygosity, and three genetic subpopulations were recognized in the restricted geographic range (Sunny et al. 2014a). ==Conservation status== Because of the species limited distribution, the clearance of the forest, and the pollution and consumption of the water by humans, it is classified by the IUCN as a critically endangered species (Shaffer et al. 2004) and as a threatened species by the Mexican government (SEMARNAT 2010). In the geographic distribution of the species, there are several threats that are modifying the ecosystem, including alteration of the stream to collect the water for human consumption, introduction of cattle, and the direct collection of specimens for traditional food (Sunny et al. 2014b). ==References== * SEMARNAT (2010) Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, Protección ambiental-Especies nativas de México de flora y fauna silvestres-Categorías de riesgo y especificaciones para su inclusión, exclusión o cambio.

She was awarded three battle stars for service in the Pacific during World War II. She was decommissioned in March 1947 and placed in reserve. Although she did not see service in the war zone, Ransom was recommissioned in March 1951 during the Korean War and remained in commission until September 1953, when she was placed in reserve again. While she remained in reserve, Ransom was reclassified as MSF-283 in February 1955 but never reactivated. In 1962 she was sold to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM DM-12. In 1994 she was renamed ARM Teniente Juan de la Barrera (C55). She was stricken in 2000, but her ultimate fate is not reported in secondary sources. == U.S. Navy career == Ransom was laid down 24 April 1943 by General Engineering & Dry Dock Co., San Francisco, California; launched 18 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Dwight H. Dexter and commissioned 5 August 1944, Lt. Comdr. William N. McMillen, USNR, in command. After shakedown off the California coast, Ransom got underway for Hawaii 15 October and arrived at Pearl Harbor a week later for escort duty back to the west coast and later to Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Kossol Roads, arriving at the latter 12 January 1945. She then worked in the antisubmarine patrol screen off Peleliu. From 1 to 18 February, Ransom acted as harbor entrance station vessel at Kossol, and patrolled in screens between Kossol and Peleliu, before proceeding to Ulithi to stage for Operation Iceberg. On 19 March she sailed for the Ryukyus with task unit TU 52.5.3 and, from 25 March to 18 April, she swept and patrolled in assigned areas around Okinawa despite heavy Japanese coastal and aerial resistance. On 6 April, Ransom shot down three suicide aircraft while rescuing 52 survivors of and . The third kamikaze's bomb caused some minor damage to Ransom. Relieved of sweeping duties 18 April, Ransom was assigned to antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrol. Although damaged on the 22nd by a bomb from a \\"Val\\" she had splashed 10 feet off her port quarter, Ransom continued to patrol through June. On 4 July Ransom resumed minesweeping operations. Throughout the month she operated in the East China Sea, sweeping a total of seven mines, then, on 6 August, she retired to Leyte for overhaul and repair. Returning to Okinawa at the end of the month, she continued on to Japan with task group TG 52.4, and on 9 September began sweeping mines at Nagasaki. On 21 September, she shifted to Bungo Suido, where she swept until the end of September. During the month Ransom swept 73 enemy mines. Ransom departed Kure, Japan, for the United States 20 November. Transiting the Panama Canal 30 December 1945, she continued on to New Orleans, Louisiana; underwent pre-inactivation overhaul; and decommissioned at Orange, Texas, 3 March 1947. Berthed at Orange for the next four years, Ransom recommissioned 16 March 1951. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, she operated out of Charleston, South Carolina, Norfolk, Virginia, and Yorktown, Virginia, through 1952. She then operated from New England to the Caribbean until decommissioned at Charleston in June 1953. She arrived at Orange, Texas, 22 September and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ransom was reclassified MSF-283 on 7 February 1955, and moved to Florida in November 1958 where she remained until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1962. She was sold to Mexico in 1962. Ransom earned three battle stars for World War II service. == Mexican Navy career == The former Ransom was acquired by the Mexican Navy in 1962 and renamed ARM DM-12. In 1994, she was renamed ARM Teniente Juan de la Barrera (C55) after Juan de la Barrera. She was stricken in 2000, and was intentionally sunk to make an artificial reef off the coast of Cancun. In 2005 hurricane Wilma hit the area and damaged the ransom and other local man made reefs. Depth is approximately 75 feet and has very little penetration on the back deck of the wreck.

Females have longer bodies and shorter tails than males. Newly-hatched larvae are a uniform brownish-black, older larvae have rows of yellow and black mottling and most terrestrial adults have large spots or streaks of yellow on a dark background, though some are plain. Some individuals are paedomorphic and do not pass through metamorphosis to the terrestrial adult state but remain as aquatic, gilled paedomorphs.

Developed by Nissan Performance Technology Inc. (NPTI), which had formerly raced under the name Electramotive in the United States, the cars were intended to be completed by the middle of 1992, with competition starting in 1993. However economic troubles for Nissan led to the cancellation of the project soon after testing of the first cars had begun, meaning that the P35s never raced. During the development of the P35, Nissan's own motorsports division, Nismo, began work on a modified P35 design that would be adapted to the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship. This car, known as the NP35, would be allowed to race only once before it too was cancelled. These would be the final prototypes built by Nissan until 1997. ==Development== At the end of a strong year in the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season for Nissan's R90CKs, it was decided that the company would leave the championship to instead concentrate on the R90CPs in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship (JSPC) and GTP ZX-Turbos in the IMSA GT Championship in North America. Regulation changes in the World Sportscar Championship would have required Nissan to abandon their turbocharged engines in place of newer, advanced naturally aspirated units, as well as design all new cars to handle them. Nissan reversed their plans in 1991, partially because JSPC was beginning to allow the newer Group C cars that could outpace Nissan's older cars. Nissan turned to Nissan Performance Technology Inc. (NPTI), the company's North American motorsports arm who had run their IMSA GT Championship program. The company was tasked with developing a new car while Nissan Motorsport (Nismo) in Japan would develop an all-new engine to fit the regulations. Designed by Yoshi Suzuka and Trevor Harris, the P35 bore little resemblance to NPTI's GTP cars given the very different regulations as well as differing airflow requirements that needed to be taken into account. The water radiator was placed in the nose with inlets for brake cooling situated there as well, the engine inlet was placed above the cockpit. The side ducts located in the horizontal face of the side pods took air to the oil coolers (and also had a unique boundary layer suction feature). A low rear wing was also used, although a dual rear wing was briefly tested. The chassis of the P35 was intended to be built from carbon fibre, yet the initial test chassis were built from a hybrid of aluminium and carbon to save time, due to NPTI's lack of experience with building carbon chassis. VRT35 engine For an engine, Nismo would develop an entire new unit. Required to be 3.5 litres by Group C rules, the engine had to not only be high-revving like a Formula One engine, but also have endurance capabilities. Nismo produced an engine at 3499 cc named the VRT35, with claims of and capable of reaching nearly 12000 rpm. The VRT35 would be a V12, in comparison to Peugeot, Toyota, and Mazda's V10 units. Following the cancellation of the P35 project in 1992, the car was briefly considered as a possible replacement for the NPT-90 in the IMSA GTP Championship, replacing the VRT35 V12 with the 3.0L turbocharged VG30 V6 that had previously been used. Wind tunnel tests were carried out on what was termed the 93GTP. However, Nissan was looking elsewhere and decided to pursue Indy Car racing. This lasted only briefly (though Indy Car concepts were beginning to be developed in the wind tunnel) and the realities of the widening recession hit home. This eventually led to the closing of NPTI in 1993. In total, three P35 chassis were built in total for testing purposes. NP35 Nismo NP35 While NPTI developed the P35, Nismo decided that although the car would be legal for competition in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, it was not as well suited to Japan's shorter race circuits. Nismo therefore decided that they would develop their own version of the P35 with an increased downforce setup as well as some other mechanical changes. Nismo used molds originally used for the creation of the P35 to create their own car, known as the NP35. Due to Nismo's access to a carbon fibre facility, the chassis of the lone NP35 was constructed entirely of carbon fiber instead of the hybrid used by NPTI. The VRT35 V12 was also modified with more power because JSPC races were not as long and endurance was not as important. Only one NP35 would be built and raced before Nissan cancelled the project. X-250 In 1992, following the closing of NPTI as well as the cancellation of the World Sportscar Championship, All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, as well as the GTP class in the IMSA GT Championship, a group of former NPTI employees, including chief mechanic John Christie, took it upon themselves to build a new car for IMSA's WSC class of open-cockpit Le Mans prototypes. Using one of the former P35 test cars, chassis #1, the team removed the roof and added roll hoops and a new cockpit surround for driver protection. The VRT35 engines were replaced with a Ferrari 3.4-liter V8. The team renamed the car \\"X-250\\" in homage of the 250 employees laid off with NPTI's demise. ==Racing history== The P35 was tested various times during 1991, with Johnny O'Connell doing most of the driving. Tests included runs at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and on the road course at Daytona International Speedway. However the P35 never competed in any races, and one copy was moved to Japan to be stored in Nissan's Zama, Kanagawa facility. The NP35 on the other hand would actually race, although only once. The final race of the 1992 JSPC season (and what would become the final JSPC race before the series was dissolved) was at Mine Circuit, and Nismo entered their lone NP35. Competing in their class against the Toyota TS010 and Mazda MXR-01, the NP35 would be the slowest car in qualifying, five seconds behind the pole winning Nissan R92CP. The race itself would see many mechanical problems for the car, although it would manage to finish the race. Of the finishers, it was ranked last and 25 laps behind the winning TS010. Following this race, the NP35 would not race again, moving into storage alongside the P35. Nissan occasionally brings it to exhibition events, namely its own annual Nismo Festival. The X-250, built by John Christie and some former members of the defunct P35 program, from P35 Chassis number 1, also only ran one race, the 1997 12 Hours of Sebring powered by a Ferrari 348 engine, built by Robin Smith, a fellow countryman of Mr. Christie. There, the car suffered electronics problems after only 21 laps and was listed as the first car out of the event. The X-250 never raced competitively again but is raced in historic racing. Chassis number 2 of the Nissan P35 is now housed in Coventry University's Motorsport Engineering Workshop. The car is used as a training vehicle for students on the University's renowned BEng Motorsports Engineering Degree. ==References== * ==External links== * Japan Le Mans Challenge - Nismo Le Mans Pavilion * Supercars.net - Nissan NP35 P35 Category:Group C cars ","title":"Nissan P35"},{"id":"12357628","text":"Mark Bos (born 28 July 1960) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1980s.

It was his first major victory, solidifying his leadership over much of the island. ==Background== After King Kalaniōpuu died in the spring of 1782, his family took his remains to the royal mausoleum known as Hale o Keawe at the important religious temple Puuhonua o Hōnaunau. While Kalaniōpuu's son Kīwalaō had inherited the kingdom, his nephew Kamehameha was given a religious position, as well as the district of Waipio valley. When a group of chiefs from the Kona district, including his brothers and uncles, Keaweaheulu, twins Kamanawa and Kameeiamoku, and Keeaumoku Pāpaiaheahe, offered to back Kamehameha instead of Kiwalao, he accepted eagerly, traveling back from his residence in Kohala. Kīwalaō's half-brother Keōuakūʻahuula had been left with no territory from his late father. He went into a rage, cutting down sacred coconut trees belonging to Kamehameha (considered a great insult) and killing some of Kamehameha's men. Their bodies were offered as a sacrifice to Kīwalaō, who accepted them, and Kamehameha felt he had to respond to the challenge to his honor.William De Witt Alexander (1891) A brief history of the Hawaiian people ==Battle== The battleground was just to the south of Kealakekua Bay, near the present-day community called Keei.,Thomas S.Dye (2003) Archaeological Survey of a Portion of Keei Makai on the bay now called Mokuakae (which could be a misspelling of Mokuōhai), South of Palemano point. The name means \\"grove of ōhai trees\\".lookup of Mokuohai on Hawaiian Place Names web site The tree, Sesbania tomentosa, is now endangered, and no longer grows in the area, so the site is only known from oral history. As tensions were building, women and children from both sides flooded into the \\"place of refuge\\", Puuhonua o Hōnaunau. Kameeiamoku was the first leader injured, but when Kīwalaō approached, Kamanawa came to his aid. Then Kīwalaō was knocked down by a sling stone, and the injured Kameeiamoku was able to slit his throat with a shark- tooth dagger. It was during this battle that the renowned red feather cloak of Kīwalaō (now in the Bishop Museum) was captured by Kamehameha the Great. ==Aftermath== Keawemaʻuhili (uncle of Kīwalaō) was captured but escaped to Hilo, and Keōuakūʻahuula fled to Kaū where he had relatives. After the battle, Kamehameha controlled the Northern and Western parts of the Big Island, including Kona, Kohala, and Hāmākua while Keawemaʻuhili controlled Hilo and Kīwalaō's half-brother Keōuakūʻahuula controlled Kaū. Kamehameha fought several more battles over many years to consolidate his control. In 1790, Keōua's party was to have their footprints frozen into volcanic ash, and in 1791 Kamehameha's forces finally killed Keōua at Puukoholā Heiau. ==References== Category:Battles involving Hawaii Category:History of Hawaii (island) Category:Ancient Hawaii Category:Conflicts in 1782 Category:1782 in Hawaii Category:Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Oceania ","title":"Battle of Mokuohai"},{"id":"12357657","text":"Arthroleptis adolfifriederici is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae.

It has several vernacular names: Poroto screeching frog, large-toad squeaker, Poroto Mountains screeching frog, and Reiche's squeaker. The specific name reichei honours Karl Friedrich Reiche, a German botanist. ==Description== A. reichei is a small Arthroleptis species: adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The head is narrow and the legs are long. The tympanum is small and is oval in shape. The finger and the toe tips are expanded. The dorsum is brown, usually with a darker hour glass pattern and a pale line or triangle between the eyes. The male advertisement call consists of irregular repetition of a single whistling note, with a duration of up 30 seconds and consisting of maximally 64 notes. The note repetition rate is about 2.3 per second.

Very little is known about this species save that it is taxonomically distinct from \\"true frogs\\" from the family Ranidae. The cave squeaker undergoes direct development, forgoing existence as a tadpole and hatching directly as miniature adults. The embryo develops into a tadpole and subsequently into an adult frog before hatching. The eggs must still be laid in a damp location, however.

His uncle was former MLB pitcher Ned Garver. ==Early years== Berenyi played basketball as well as baseball at Fairview High School. While attending Glen Oaks Community College, Berenyi was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the nineteenth round of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. After a year at Northwest Missouri State University, he was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round (3rd overall) of the June Secondary draft. ==Cincinnati Reds== He went 37-30 with a 3.07 earned run average and 519 strikeouts over five seasons in the Reds' farm system to earn a mid season call up to the majors in . He was completely dismantled by the Houston Astros in his major league debut. Making the start, he faced seven batters, retiring just one. He was pulled with four runs already across the plate, and runners on first and second. Reliever Mario Soto allowed both inherited runners to score before retiring the new two, giving Berenyi six earned runs in just a third of an inning. He earned his first career win against the New York Mets on July 18. He held the Mets scoreless with seven strikeouts through seven before allowing the first three batters he faced in the eighth to reach. The Mets had pushed a run across, and had runners on first and third when Berenyi exited the game in favor of Tom Hume. Hume allowed both inherited runners to score, giving Berenyi three earned runs in seven innings on the day. Young starters Berenyi, Soto, Frank Pastore and Mike LaCoss behind veteran future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver pitched the 1981 Reds to a Major League Baseball best 66-41 record (Due to a split-season format, caused by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, they failed to make the playoffs because they finished in second both halves of the season). Berenyi was 4-2 with a 5.01 ERA when he pitched a one hit shutout against the Montreal Expos to lower his ERA to 4.31 as the players headed into the strike. Berenyi ran into some hard luck in the second half of the season. He was just 4-4 despite dropping his ERA to 2.64. Overall, he was 9-6 with a 3.50 ERA and 106 strikeouts in twenty starts. His 77 walks led the National League. Berenyi got off to a 4-1 start in April before hard luck began to haunt him once again. He went 1-8 over his next thirteen games despite an ERA that was only slightly above 4.00. After a decent stretch after the All-Star break (3-1, 2.35 ERA), Berenyi lost his next eight decisions in a row with a 3.84 ERA. He was the losing pitcher on August 14 against the Astros despite not allowing an earned run. He also did not allow an earned run in his next start, and got a no decision (for the season, Berenyi had a 2.15 ERA in his no decisions). He shutout the Astros for his ninth and final win of the season on September 24. He had a league worst eighteen losses for a Reds team that was last in the major leagues in scoring (3.36 runs a game) and slugging (.350), and lost 101 games. After a season that saw Berenyi go 9-14 with a 3.86 ERA, he began requesting a trade. Off season rumors of deals to the Tigers and New York Yankees never materialized, and he went into the season still with the Reds. In the second game of the season, he pitched six strong innings, allowing two runs, but the Reds team that scored eight runs for Mario Soto in the season opener was shutout with Berenyi on the mound. On May 5, Berenyi faced five batters, and failed to record an out in a start against the Philadelphia Phillies. On May 19, he faced five St. Louis Cardinals batters, and failed to record an out. He wast 3-7 with an even 6.00 ERA on June 15 when the Reds traded him to the Mets for minor leaguers Jay Tibbs, Eddie Williams and Matt Bullinger. ==New York Mets== Thanks to its core of young prospects, the perennial cellar dwelling Mets were a surprising 33-25 when Berenyi joined them. The Mets released veteran Mike Torrez in order to make room for Berenyi in their starting rotation, making Berenyi the Mets' oldest starter at 29 years old. He lost his first Mets start, but rebounded in his second, pitching seven shutout innings against the Expos before handing the ball to Doug Sisk. As a Met, he went 9-6 with a 3.76 ERA. Despite his only being with the Mets for half a season, 1984 turned out to be the year he made the most appearances with his new club. In his first start of against Mario Soto and the Reds, he pitched seven innings of one hit, one walk ball. He pitched two innings into his third start of the season before being lifted with shoulder pain. He would undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery that would sideline him for the remainder of the season. The Mets used a slow approach with Berenyi in . He made four appearances out of the bullpen, pitching 5.1 innings, before making his first start. He would make seven starts, never pitching more than six innings before being reassigned to the triple A Tidewater Tides. He went 2-6 with a 6.61 ERA at Tidewater. The Mets released Berenyi following the 1986 World Series.

Camp Wallace served from 1918 to 1971 as satellite facility of the army base which became Fort Eustis. It was the first site of the Army's aerial tramway. ==Camp Abraham Eustis== During World War I, Camp Abraham Eustis was established by the United States Army in Warwick County, Virginia in 1918. It encompassed historic Mulberry Island. In 1923, the Camp became Fort Eustis. The former Warwick County consolidated to become a part of the independent city of Newport News in 1958. Fort Eustis, near the southwestern edge of the city just east of the Lee Hall community, which remains as an important U.S. Army base in the 21st century. ==An outpost upriver == A few miles upstream along the James River from the Warwick River and Mulberry Island, a satellite facility, Camp Wallace, was established in 1918 as the Upper Firing Range of for artillery training. Consisting of 30 barracks, six storehouses, and eight mess halls, it was located on on the edge of Grove, west of Carter's Grove Plantation, south of U.S. Route 60, and east of the old Kingsmill Plantation in nearby James City County. Camp Wallace included some rugged terrain and bluffs overlooking the river. It was the site of anti-aircraft training during World War II. Many years later, the Army's aerial tramway was first erected at Camp Wallace and later moved to Fort Eustis near the Reserve Fleet for further testing. The purpose of the tramway was to provide cargo movement from ship- to-shore, shore-to-ship, and overland. The tramway supplemented beach and pier operations, used unloading points deemed unusable due to inadequate or non- navigable waters, or to traverse land that was otherwise impassable.Motor Transport Corps ==Conversions: a land swap== In 1971, the U.S. Army agreed to a land swap with Anheuser-Busch in return for a larger parcel which is located directly across Skiffe's Creek from Fort Eustis. Along with land previously owned by Colonial Williamsburg, the former Camp Wallace land became part of a massive development. Nearby, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park opened in 1975, as well as a large brewery, and the Kingsmill Resort.Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg Virginia (VA) Busch Gardens Williamsburg also named a railroad crossing after Camp Wallace on the Busch Gardens Railway. ==Remnants of military use== In October 2009, the Virginia Gazette reported that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study of possible remaining problems with ordnance ground pollution was posted in the Williamsburg Regional Library and two public hearings were scheduled. According to the news reports, \\"The Corps has deemed the hazards 'critical' and assigned a high rating of probable danger.

The company's German branch supported the expedition during which this species was discovered. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is visible. Males have a hypertrophied third finger. The toes have small but distinct discs and rudimentary webbing. The dorsum is tan and has three large dark consecutive blotches that may be well-defined but also show a varying degree fading, depending on a specimen. There is a broad black lateral band that runs from the tip of the snout through the eye and then descends towards venter at the mid-body. The flanks are immaculate pink. The arms and legs are dorsally tan and have some thin, broken black bands. The venter is blue and has varying degree of black speckling. ==Habitat and conservation== Cardioglossa alsco is found in montane gallery forests at elevations of above sea level. It is associated with streams, the presumed habitat for the tadpoles. The types were found under large stones around shallow pools, adjacent to a creek running in a gallery forest. Males were calling at night during the dry season. This species is threatened by habitat loss due to the clearance of forest for pasture; however, the remaining forest is difficult to access and is less susceptible to this threat. The habitat remains vulnerable to threat of fire.

The holotype has blackish brown throat with white spots, whereas the paratype has white throat densely beset with minute, black dots. ==Habitat and conservation== Leptodactylodon stevarti occurs in primary forest at elevations of above sea level. Specimens have been found under rocks along streams in deep, narrow valleys. Breeding takes place in fast-flowing, rocky streams. The paratype had eaten a large ant and a small ground beetle. The species is threatened by habitat loss caused by smallholder farming activities and logging. It occurs in Crystal Mountains National Park, but protection of forest in the national park is required. ==References== stevarti Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Gabon Category:Endemic fauna of Gabon Category:Amphibians described in 2003 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Olivier Sylvain Gérard Pauwels ","title":"Leptodactylodon stevarti"},{"id":"12357966","text":"Leptodactylodon ventrimarmoratus is a species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae.

Saravanan, making his directorial debut. The film stars Silambarasan in dual roles while Sneha, Sana Khan, Prabhu and Kishore also play lead roles. Nedumudi Venu, Santhanam Nambiar and Ponvannan play supporting roles with Premji Amaren in a special appearance. Yuvan Shankar Raja composed the film's background score and soundtrack.Listen to fast-pace 'Silambattam' songs The film released on 12 December 2008. It was later dubbed into Telugu and released as Maa Vaadu. Silambattam opened to mixed reviews but became a commercial superhit. == Synopsis == Vichu (Silambarasan) is a quiet village priest brought up by his maternal grandfather (Nedumudi Venu). Owing to specific reasons, the caring elder has purposefully toned down (Vichu uses his eyes to convey his inner quietude) the young boy's emotional quotient and has taught him a peculiar art of living. As a result, Vichu is soft-spoken, passive, and is groomed to tolerate all sorts of malicious misdemeanors aimed at him. Vichu assists his grandfather in carrying out religious rituals as well as being the temple's caretaker. Vichu's only consolation comes in the company of his sweetheart Jaanu (Sana Khan). Jaanu's kiddish jokes and teasing remarks make up for all the precious and youthful moments that he has missed in his growing-up years. Though Vichu abides by his elder's advice, an incident in the temple premises reveals his real persona. On the particular day, Vichu witnesses a big band of ruffians bashing a seemingly meek individual. Becoming furious at the sight of the power-play, Vichu gets into the tussle and saves the victim. As the man (Vinayakan) takes a hard look at his savior face, he is stunned. What is the secrecy in Vichu's past and how does it intimidate the stranger makes rest of the story. == Cast == * Silambarasan as Vichu, a young, energetic Brahmin and Tamizharasan, Vichu's father, who comes in the flashback. * Prabhu as Muthuvel, Tamizh's elder brother and Vichu's paternal uncle.

R. Silambarasan directed by Saravanan. Simbu confirmed the project and stating that he had put on weight and grew a beard for his participation in the project. Following the flop of Kaalai, Silambarasan started immediately to commencing his shoot for the film. The film was launched at AVM Studios on 7 December 2007. Silambattam was 25th film for \\"Lakshmi Movie Makers\\". The 40-member unit consisting of Silambarasan, director Saravanan, cameraman Mathi, action choreographer Kanal Kannan and a few stunt men from Chennai began their first schedule for a 10-day stint. The crew shot schedules in Theni and Ooty and various other locations in South India during the filming. The film finished its talkie portion in early September 2008, and the song were canned in India as well as parts of Sri Lanka. The film, initially described as a \\"musical action comedy\\".  Casting  Following the announcement of the project, Kajal Aggarwal was rumoured to be the heroine, following her successful role in Pazhani. However, due to differences, Kajal was ousted from the project due to her limited callsheets. However other indications claimed that Kajal was ousted from the project, even Bhavana and Shriya were considered for the role. Then Sneha replaced Kajal Agarwal. Sana Khan was introduced as the other heroine of the project. Nedumudi Venu was selected to play the role of the grandfather of Silambarasan, whilst Prabhu Ganesan was given a chance to make a cameo appearance in the film as Silambarasan's uncle. Supporting actors Santhanam, Karunaas and Premji Amaren also play roles in Silambattam. For a particular sequence, Simbhu donned the costume of Billa. Meenakshi of \\"Karuppusaamy Kuthagaithaarar\\" fame has roped in for a single song.  Filming  Simbhu was dancing for a song sequence at Pollachi but due to his misfortune he sustained sprain injury in his ankle leading to the cancellation of the shooting. He was immediately rushed to a local hospital where he was administered treatment and was advised for the next couple of days. Some scenes for Silambattam were shot in a small village called Thirukadaiyur near Kumbakonam district. Since the shooting in Thirukadaiyur is over, the Silambattam troop has now moved to Thiruvaiaru which is near Thirukadaiyur for shooting the next part. A grand set has been erected to depict a 'thiruvizha' scene and shooting is going on day and night. For a song sequence, a set was put up for a cost of Rs. 70 lakhs and it was picturized for 10 days. Yesteryear actress Sangita, who married Saravanan, helped her husband on Silambattam shooting. == Soundtrack == The music of Silambattam was scored by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Initially Dhina was roped in as the composer, before Silambarasan opted for his friend Yuvan Shankar Raja, with whom he has often worked together and has given very successful albums. The soundtrack was released on 20 October 2008, and features 5 songs, whilst lyrics were penned by 'Kavignar' Vaali, Gangai Amaran, Na. Muthukumar, Earl, Suzie Q. and Silambarasan himself. Already before the audio launch, three preview songs of the film were released online, \\"Nallamdhana\\", \\"Silambattam\\" and \\"Where is the Party\\". The songs from the albums were released in late September to four leading FM stations in Chennai, with one song per station, in attempt to popularize it before the official launch. After the release, the songs gained much popularity especially among youth, with \\"Where is the Party\\" in particular, topping the charts for several weeks. The song and also the album featured in Top 10 lists, too. The album got three awards at the Isaiaruvi Tamil Music Awards 2008 in the categories, Sensational Youth Album, Crazy Song of the Year (\\"Where Is The Party\\") and Best Remix Song of the Year (\\"Vechikkava\\"). == Release == The satellite rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar. The film was given a \\"U/A\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board. Originally scheduled to release on Diwali, but due to post-production works it was postponed to 12 December 2008.  Special screenings  Silambarasan had a special screening with Ajith Kumar. On 14 December 2008, the cast and crew of Silambarasan's next film Vinnai Thaandi Varuvaaya also watched this film on a special screening.

It is a Central African species of frog in the family Arthroleptidae. It is monotypic within the genus Trichobatrachus. Its common name refers to the somewhat hair-like structures on the body and thighs of the breeding male. ==Description== Illustration Males are about long from snout to vent, while females are . The large head is broader than long, with a short rounded snout. The former have a paired internal vocal sac and three short ridges of small black spines along the inner surface of the first manual digit. Breeding males also develop – somewhat hair-like – dermal papillae that extend along the flanks and thighs. These contain arteries and are thought to increase the surface area for the purpose of absorbing oxygen (comparably to external gills of the aquatic stage), which is useful as the male stays with his eggs for an extended period of time after they have been laid in the water by the female. The species is terrestrial, but returns to the water for breeding, where egg masses are laid onto rocks in streams. The quite muscular tadpoles are carnivorous and feature several rows of horned teeth. Adults feed on slugs, myriapods, spiders, beetles and grasshoppers. The hairy frog is also notable in possessing retractable \\"claws\\" (though unlike true claws, they are made of bone, not keratin), which it may project through the skin, apparently by intentionally breaking the bones of the toe. In addition, the researchers found a small bony nodule nestled in the tissue just beyond the frog's fingertip. When sheathed, each claw is anchored to the nodule with tough strands of collagen, but, as Gerald DurrellDurrell, G. The Bafut Beagles Rupert Hart-Davis, 1954; chapter 5. discovered firsthand, when the frog is grabbed or attacked, the frog breaks the nodule connection and forces its sharpened bones through the skin. This is probably a defensive behavior. Although a retraction mechanism is not known, it has been hypothesized that the claws later retract passively, while the damaged tissue is regenerated. Amphibian researcher and biologist David Wake of the University of California, Berkeley, says that this type of weaponry appears to be unique in the animal kingdom, (although the Otton Frog possesses a similar \\"spike\\" in its thumb). Also David Cannatella, a herpetologist at the University of Texas, Austin, questions whether the bony protrusions are meant for fighting. They could allow a frog's feet \\"to get a better grip on whatever rocky habitat they might be in,\\" he says. ==Distribution== It is found in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, and possibly Angola. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, rivers, arable land, plantations, and heavily degraded former forest. ==Conservation status== T. robustus is threatened by habitat loss, but is not considered endangered. ==Relation with humans== This species is roasted and eaten in Cameroon. They are hunted with long spears or machetes. The Bakossi people traditionally believed that the frogs fall from the sky and, when eaten, it would help childless couples become fertile. ==References== * AmphibiaWeb: Trichobatrachus robustus * New Scientist news service: 'Horror frog' breaks own bones to produce claws Retrieved on June 9, 2008. * (2008): Concealed weapons: erectile claws in African frogs. biology letters (published online). – PDF ==External links== * Hairy Frog – Trichobatrachus robustus, The BioFresh Cabinet of Freshwater Curiosities. * Category:Arthroleptidae Category:Amphibians described in 1900 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Amphibians of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Amphibians of Equatorial Guinea Category:Amphibians of Gabon Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Hairy frog"},{"id":"12357996","text":"Watt is the fifth studio album by the English blues rock band Ten Years After, released in 1970.

After moving to Chicago he began to experiment with designing his own trumpet, taking measurements from his personal instrument, a French Besson. By the end of 1935, using pre-made components along with parts he fashioned, he constructed a trumpet for his own use. He continued refining the process and began selling the instruments, until, in 1937, he was able to manufacture and assemble trumpets using parts solely made in his home workshop. In 1939 he started to advertise the Benge Company, and he continued making trumpets in his Chicago home until 1953. In part due to a severe case of spinal arthritis, he moved to Burbank, California, where he continued to make “The World’s Finest Trumpet” until his death on December 13, 1960. After Elden Benge's death, the company was run by his son Donald Benge, who later went on to be the creator of the widely successful Conquest board game. The company enjoyed a very strong reputation among professional players in the Los Angeles area recording industry during the 1960s.How did the L.A. Benge Claude Gordon model come about In general the company did very little advertising and sold trumpets mostly to professionals and serious students through a network of professional players. In December 1970, Donald Benge sold the company to Leisure Time Industries and production was moved from the Benge garage to an upstairs shop in downtown Los Angeles above Lockie Music Exchange, also owned by Leisure Time. In 1972 the company was bought by King Musical Instruments, then a subsidiary of the Seeburg Corporation, who moved production to Anaheim, California and increased production substantially.HNWhite.com King and related assets were acquired by Seeburg's creditors under bankruptcy in 1979 then sold to Daniel J. Henkin (1930 - 2012), owner of C. G. Conn, in 1983. King discontinued production in Anaheim and used the \\"Benge\\" name for a different model of trumpets mass-produced in Eastlake, Ohio starting in 1983. In 1985 King was acquired by the Swedish venture capital firm Skåne Gripen, then joined with C. G. Conn the following year to form United Musical Instruments (UMI). Ownership of UMI passed to Steinway Musical Instruments in 2000, who put the UMI assets under their Conn-Selmer subsidiary in 2003. Conn-Selmer discontinued production under the \\"Benge\\" name in 2005. Production of Benge model trumpets, branded Burbank, was resumed by Kanstul Musical Instruments Company in Fullerton, CA, in 1985.

It is also known under the common names Philippine flat-headed frog, Palawan flat-headed frog, Busuanga jungle toad, Busuanga disk-tongued toad, and Philippine aquatic frog. It is endemic to the Busuanga, Culion, Balabac, and Palawan islands in the Philippines. It is an inhabitant of clear-water streams and is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== Barbourula busuangensis is a large aquatic species of frog. Its body is flattened dorso-ventrally and its nostrils and eyes are located at the top of its head. It has no external tympani. Both fore and hind limbs are robust and powerful and the digits of the hands are webbed as well as those of the feet. The surface of the body is covered with fine tubercles. This frog is a dark greenish-black in colour with some faint pale green hatching and spotting on the hind limbs. ==Distribution and habitat== This frog is endemic to the western Philippines where it is present on Busuanga, Culion, Balabac, and Palawan. Its typical habitat is fast-flowing, unpolluted streams in lowland tropical forests at elevations below asl. It often floats on the surface, but is very wary and dives to the bottom and hides if it is disturbed. ==Breeding== Little is known of the breeding habits of this rare species and tadpoles have not been observed. Pregnant females have been found with a small number of large, unpigmented eggs. This led researchers to hypothesize that development may be direct without an intervening tadpole stage. Attempts to get the species to breed in the laboratory have been unsuccessful. ==Status== The IUCN lists this frog as \\"near threatened\\". The reasons given are that it occurs in a few locations, its populations are fragmented, and its numbers are declining. The main threats it faces are degradation of its habitat, changing agricultural practices, quarrying, mining and pollution of the streams with runoff from agricultural land. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Barbourula Category:Amphibians described in 1924 Category:Amphibians of the Philippines Category:Endemic fauna of the Philippines Category:Fauna of Palawan Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor ","title":"Barbourula busuangensis"},{"id":"12358044","text":"The Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is a species of frog in the family Bombinatoridae. Although many salamanders are lungless, the Bornean flat-headed frog is the first frog known to have no lungs.

However, he did not know the frog was lungless until he was in the field with David Bickford's expedition. Bickford et al. were able to dissect some of the specimens and discovered for the first time that the frogs had no lungs. The frog breathes entirely through its skin, and its internal organs (the stomach, spleen and the liver) take up much of the space which normally would be filled by the lungs. By retaining the lunglessness of their tadpole stage, the frogs are much flatter than typical frogs, which might help absorb oxygen and avoid being swept away in fast streams. ==Description== This frog grows to a snout-to-vent length of for females and males are slightly smaller. It has a dorsoventrally flattened body with a broad head with a rounded snout. The limbs are robust and both hands and feet are fully webbed.

Vauluisant Abbey,Abbé Chevin, Dictionnaire Latin-Français des Noms propres de Lieux ayant une certaine notoriété principalement au point de vue ecclésiastique et monastique (1897) gives the Latin equivalent, \\"Vallis Lucens\\". near Courgenay in the canton of Brienon-sur-Armançon, Yonne, France, is a Cistercian abbey founded in 1127 by a group of monks from Preuilly Abbey (Seine-et-Marne) who came to settle between the forest of Othe and the forest of Lancy, an area near the borders of Ile-de-France, Champagne and Burgundy that had come to be far from human habitation.The fine Roman head found at Vauluisant shows that it must have been the site of a well-appointed Roman villa. They diverted the waters of the little River AlainThe Alain is a tributary of the Vanne; for other place-names marking the presence of the Alans in Gaul, see Alans. and by 1 April 1129, works were far enough advanced for Henri Sanglier, the archbishop of Sens, to consecrate the modest oratory. By 1140 Vauluisant was fully operational. The abbey church was consecrated in 1149. In the second half of the 12th century, granges were established to cultivate abbey lands far from the abbey itself, at Beauvais, Toucheboeuf, Livanne, Cérilly, Armentières, worked by lay brothers who lived communally. Ironworks were established, fuelled by the dense woodlands, and tileworks, whose kilns were also fired by forest timber. The energetic Cistercians of Vauluisant produced more than the abbey needed; the surplus was sold in the market towns of Troyes and Provins, where the abbots retained domiciles, and at the cathedral town of Sens.Vauluisant: \\"Un Bref Historique\\". The abbey was attacked and pillaged and its mills destroyed several times during the Hundred Years War;Nevertheless a thirteenth-century cartulary from Vauluisant survives: Bibliothèque nationale: Mss lat. 9901. (Noted in Jacques Flach, Les origines de l'ancienne France: Xe et XIe siècles [Paris:LaRose and Forcel 1886] p. 35. its ancient structures were repaired and rebuilt in the 15th century with the return of royal authority to the region of Sens in the reign of Charles VII. At the opening of the 16th century, under the direction of abbot Antoine Pierre (elected in 1502) the abbey was transformed and enlarged with an enclosed park, a grand fortified gatehouse, a grange dimière (tithe barn), a dovecote, a mill, a rebuilt chapel and spacious new lodgings for guests— the remains that can be recognized today. François I with his court was a guest at Vauluisant more than once, and Jacques de Savoie, 2nd Duc de Nemours was born at Vauluisant in 1531. But the rich benefice of Vauluisant attracted a series of abbots who held it in commendam, enjoying the income while the abbey slipped into disrepair; among them was Odet de Coligny, the well-beneficed cardinal who joined the Reformed church and was excommunicated.Stéphane Lecouteux, \\"Sur la dispersion de la bibliothèque bénédictine\\" note 2 The Diadumenos head from Vauluisant, a 2nd- century CE Roman copy after a Greek model (Louvre) During the French Wars of Religion, Vauluisant suffered further damage: an armed troop partially destroyed the abbey church in 1562, and there were multiple episodes of pillaging between 1571 and 1576. In 1636 Cardinal Richelieu imposed a reform, replacing the monks with strict Cistercians. A bird's-eye view of Vauluisant, drawn for Abbot Le Tellier in 1692 is conserved in the Bibliothèque nationale: it is a precious document of the state of the abbey's structures.Vauluisant: \\"Un Bref Historique\\". A program of restorations was undertaken in the 18th century, funded by the Cistercians' sale of timber from abbey forests. The abbey was secularised in the Revolution and sold as a bien national. In 1835 it was purchased by the progressive banker Léopold Javal (1804–1872), who farmed the estate according to modern principles of agronomy; most of the structures had been demolished, leaving a range of the visitors' lodgings to the left of the fortified gatehouse, and the remains of the abbot's lodging, rebuilt in the 18th century and again 1866-, which constitutes the \\"Château\\" of Vauluisant. Considerable garden works were undertaken at the same time.\\"Un fermier de Vauluisant\\" Modern conservation of the former chapel of St. Mary Magdalene was undertaken from 1965 by M. Jean Gamby, and further conservation of the grange and commons. Vauluisant is the property of Mme Viviane Demoulin Gamby. It is open to visitors Sunday afternoons from April to October. At Troyes, the Hôtel de Vauluisant, the abbot's seat in the cathedral city, has housed the Musée historique de Troyes et de Champagne, with a decorative arts collection that includes a 19th-century model of Troyes Cathedral. At the market centre of Provins, another Hôtel de Vauluisant conserves its 13th- century façade. At Vauluisant during the time of Léopold Javal, in 1863 or 1865, while the farm was let to Edme-François Pailleret\\"Un fermier de Vauluisant\\" was found the fine marble head of Diadumenos type, a Roman copy after a Greek bronze original, now conserved in the Louvre.

The specific name kandianus means \\"from Kandy\\" and seems to suggest that the type material came from near the city of Kandy. ==Rediscovery== As there had been no record of the species since 1872, it was listed as extinct by the IUCN in 2004. However, in June 2012 it was announced that almost three years earlier, in October 2009, the species was rediscovered in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary in Sri Lanka. In light of the discovery, the species was reclassified in 2012 as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Another extant population was reported in 2014 from Pidurutalagala Forest Reserve. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The parotoid glands are relatively long, which is the single morphological trait that separates Adenomus kandianus from Adenomus kelaartii with shorter parotoid glands. The tympanum is submerged and poorly visible. The toes are partially to fully webbed; the partially webbed morphs were described as a separate species, Adenomus dasi, but because the morphs show negligible genetic differences, A. dasi is not longer recognized as distinct. The fingers have no webbing. The dorsum is yellowish brown; the head is more reddish compared to the body. A tiny gold-coloured vertebral stripe is present. The parotoid glands are chocolate or dark brown. The lips have black and gold dots. The venter is gold. An hourglass-shaped pattern of tubercles on the dorsum may be present. The tadpole has relatively long body (39% of total length). The body is flattened and wide anteriorly, accommodating a ventral sucker disc that covers more than half of the body. The eyes are bulbous.

It is endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is found in the south-west of the island at elevations between 30 and 1,230 m. The specific name kelaartii honours Edward Frederick Kelaart, a Ceylonese-born physician and zoologist. ==Description== Günther's \\"Catalogue of the Batrachia Salientia in the collection of the British Museum\\" Kelaart's toad is a fairly small species with females having a snout-to vent length of and males . The skin in some individuals is smooth but in others it bears spiny warts. The upper parts are brown more or less blotched with darker colour and the underparts are cream or white, blotched with brown and sometimes speckled with red flecks. In some individuals, there are both red and blue flecks on the underside. ==Distribution and habitat== Kelaart's toad is endemic to southwestern Sri Lanka where it is found at altitudes of up to above sea level. It does not have a continuous distribution as its range is fragmented into a number of separate locations. Its typical habitat is tropical humid forests where it occurs in the leaf litter on the ground near upland streams. It sometimes climbs into the lower parts of trees and has also been seen on sandbanks beside rivers, in rock crevices, in rotting logs and in holes in trees. ==Biology== Kelaart's toad is active both by day and by night. During the breeding season males call from beside bodies of water including mid- stream boulders. Females lay up to one thousand colourless eggs in a single strand, usually in a permanent pool. The tadpoles are also colourless at first but become grey as they develop and later dark brown. Metamorphosis takes place after about seven weeks and the juvenile toads emerging from the water are about long. ==Status== Kelaart's toad is fairly common in suitable habitat within its range but it occupies a total area of less than and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being an \\"endangered species\\". The chief threats it faces are the destruction of its forest habitat as trees are cut down and the land turned to agricultural use.

Its natural habitats are Schefflera-Hagenia-Hypericum forests and Afro-alpine moorland, and the transition zone in between. It is threatened by habitat loss and is listed by the IUCN as being an \\"endangered species\\". ==Description== Malcolm's Ethiopian toad is a small robust species. The females reach a snout-to-vent length of and males reach in length. The head is broad and the upper jaw is longer than the lower one. The paratoid gland is some way behind the eye and is short and narrow. The colour of the upper parts is quite variable with different individuals being greenish-grey, grey, greyish-brown or black. There are dark spots arranged along three longitudinal bands of paler colour, pink, dull red or green. The flanks are grey or greyish-black and may be delineated by a thin white line. The underparts are cream or dull white with darker spots and blotches. ==Distribution== Malcolm's Ethiopian toad is endemic to the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia where it is found at elevations of between above sea level. At lower altitudes it is found in grassy meadows besides streams but higher up on the mountain plateau it is present in forests composed of Schefflera, Hagenia and Hypericum and also on afromontane moorlands. ==Biology== Malcolm's Ethiopian toad has what is believed to be a unique pattern of development. Males advertise their presence with calls that are only audible within a few meters. Both males and females wander through wet grasses near streams and pools until they meet, after which the male calls more intensely. Other males congregate at the site and there is great competition to mate with the female. Fertilization is internal and takes place after the successful couple engage in face-to-face amplexus. The female produces about twenty large eggs enclosed in a mucus layer while still in amplexus. These are deposited in the vegetation or occasionally under logs or in leaf litter. The female then departs the scene but the males remain and attract more females by their calling. These lay their eggs at the same site and the communal egg mass may originate from as many as twenty females. The males eventually disperse when no more females arrive. There is no more parental involvement and the eggs develop into non-feeding tadpoles which rely on the large yolk-sac in the egg. In the laboratory eggs have hatched after eleven days but in the field, at a lower temperature, this is likely to take longer. By the time they hatch, the tadpoles have started reabsorbing their tails but metamorphosis is completed after hatching. ==Status== Although Malcolm's Ethiopian toad is common in some localities within its range, the population trend is believed to be downward. The main threats faced by this toad are the degradation of its habitat through timber extraction, increased grazing of cattle and the development of settlements, although part of its range is within the Bale Mountains National Park which should offer some protection from human activities. The fungus causing chytridiomycosis is present in the Ethiopian highlands and has been found to occur in this species. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this toad as being an \\"endangered species\\". ==References== Category:Altiphrynoides Category:Amphibians of Ethiopia Category:Endemic fauna of Ethiopia Category:Bale Mountains Category:Ethiopian Highlands Category:Endangered animals Category:Endangered biota of Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1978 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Malcolm's Ethiopian toad"},{"id":"12358090","text":"The Western Andes toad, Rhaebo atelopoides, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae endemic to Colombia, where it is only known from the type locality in the Munchique National Natural Park, on the western slope of the Cordillera Occidental, Cauca.

It is also known as Malayan slender toad, Malaya stream toad, and pigmy false toad. It is found on the Malay Peninsula, from the Kra Isthmus (Thailand) southward to Peninsular Malaysia. However, its precise distribution in Thailand is poorly known as it may have been confused with Ansonia kraensis, described as a new species in 2005; it may also represent more than one species. ==Description== Ansonia malayana males measure and females in snout–vent length or slightly more. Tympanum is distinct. Dorsum has small round warts and tubercles and is dark brown in colour, with greenish yellow marks, an interrupted light interorbital chevron, a light interscapular spot, and an interrupted light dorsolateral arc. Limbs have yellowish crossbars. Sides of head and body have small yellow spots. ==Habitat== Its natural habitats are lowland and montane tropical moist forests. It breeds in streams (where the tadpole develop), and adults are often found in boulder crevices and leaf-litter in streams. It is found at altitudes between 300 and 1,300 m. It is potentially threatened by habitat loss. ==References== malayana Category:Amphibians of Malaysia Category:Amphibians of Thailand Category:Amphibians described in 1960 Category:Taxa named by Robert F.

It is endemic to the central and western Mindanao, the Philippines. The specific name mcgregori honors Richard Crittenden McGregor, an Australian ornithologist who collected the holotype. Common names McGregor's toad, McGregori's river toad, and McGregor's stream toad have been coined for it. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The tympanum is not visible. The finger tips are rounded and bear small discs, not wider than rest of the phalanges. The toes are almost fully webbed. The hind legs have crossbars. Adult males have a subgular vocal sac. ==Habitat and conservation== Ansonia mcgregori is a terrestrial toad associated with cool mountain streams and rivers in lower montane and lowland forests at elevations of above sea level. Individuals have been found above rocks covered with mosses, on rock crevices, and on leaf litter near streams. Although it is generally restricted to undisturbed or minimally disturbed habitats, a few individuals have been found in secondary forest, plantations, small-scale agroecosystems, and in the floor of a cave surrounded by farmland–disturbed lowland dipterocarp forest mosaic. Breeding takes place in streams. This species is common in suitable habitat. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by small-scale agricultural activities, large-scale oil palm plantations, wood collection for charcoal production, and expanding human settlements. Furthermore, agricultural effluents, soil erosion, and mine tailings can impact its stream habitat. It is known to occur in several protected areas. ==References== mcgregori Category:Amphibians of the Philippines Category:Endemic fauna of the Philippines Category:Fauna of Mindanao Category:Amphibians described in 1922 Category:Taxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Ansonia mcgregori"},{"id":"12358145","text":"Ansonia minuta is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae, described from the forests of Sarawak in 1960.

It is about 5 cm (2.0 in) long and typically black, though some populations have orange coloration. This species is endemic to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range of northern Colombia. It is critically endangered because of the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and habitat destruction due to agriculture. The species had not been seen from 1994 until it was rediscovered in early 2008. ==Taxonomy== This species was initially described by Alexander G. Ruthven in 1916 from specimens collected by M. A. Carriker, Jr., in 1914. In 1994, a new species, Atelopus leoperezii, was described, only to later be determined to be the Guajira stubfoot toad. Its closest relative is believed to be Atelopus ignescens of Ecuador. ==Description== The frog is about 5.0 cm long. It has at least two color phases, with the rarer orange population being the one recently rediscovered. However, the frog is typically all black, although it is a slightly lighter shade on its belly. In adults, the skin is smooth except for a patch of spiny warts on the side. The area that these warts cover varies, with some specimens displaying them from their eyes to their arms and others displaying it from their eyes to their femurs. One specimen even had the warts covering the entire body. The Guajira stubfoot toad has short legs with rounded fingers and toes. While its fingers are unwebbed, its toes are broadly webbed, though its first toe is distinct. Its head is as broad as it is long. ==Distribution and habitat== It is endemic to about in northern Colombia. Its natural habitats are sub-Andean and Andean cloud forests, and páramo. In addition, it is known to survive in snow-covered areas. It is found at elevations between 2,350 and 4,800 m. It can tolerate some habitat modification, but habitat loss caused by agriculture remains a threat. ==Ecology== This species lays its eggs in chains in freshwater mountain streams, where its tadpoles develop. ==Conservation== While the frog was common historically, it is currently endangered due to habitat loss from agriculture, climate change, crop fumigation, and, most significantly, the virulent chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This fungus was predicted to lower the population of the species by over 80%. This toad was rediscovered after an absence of 14 years by a Project Atelopus team in early 2008 in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains of Magdalena, Colombia. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Picture of species Category:Atelopus Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia Category:Amphibians described in 1916 Category:Taxa named by Alexander Grant Ruthven Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta ","title":"Guajira stubfoot toad"},{"id":"12358215","text":"Atelopus certus, the Darien stubfoot toad or Toad Mountain harlequin frog, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae endemic to Panama. ==Geographic range== The toad is endemic to the Darien region of eastern Panama, and its type locality is Cerro Sapo (literally \\"toad mountain\\"), giving it its common names Refrigerator and xylophone. ==Habitat== Its natural habitats are tropical montane and submontane forests.

It is endemic to Venezuela and is known from the central Venezuelan Coastal Range. The species was already suspected to be extinct because, despite considerable effort, none had been found since 1986. However, in 2003, a small population was found, with few other locations discovered later. It is mainly threatened by chytridiomycosis. It is locally called sapito rayado. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is slender. The snout is pointed in dorsal view. No tympanum is visible, but the supratympanic crest is well developed. There are small rounded warts present on the dorsolateral surfaces, most prominently around the arm insertions and as a dorsolateral row. The fingers have basal webbing while the toes are slightly more webbed. The hind limbs are relatively long. Preserved specimens have greenish tan color that is lighter on the ventral side. The dorsal surfaces have dense brown vermiculation as well as a X-pattern behind the head. ==Diet== The main sources of food for these frogs are ants and other small insects. ==Habitat and conservation== Atelopus cruciger was historically abundant and widely spread in the Venezuelan Coastal Range at elevations up to above sea level, although most records were from gallery, cloud, and semi- deciduous forests at above sea level. Atelopus cruciger usually occurs near streams and rivulets. These frogs are diurnal and often found on stones, but can also climb to vegetation up to 1.5 meters above the ground. Breeding takes place along swift-flowing streams. However, the species has undergone a dramatic decline, and only few populations are known to persist. These are all at low altitudes () on the northern slope of the Henri Pittier National Park. The main reason for the decline is believed to be chytridiomycosis. Many of the historic collections came from protected areas. Air pollution (acid rain) could also be a contributing factor, given the proximity to the industries in the Valencia-Maracay area. ==In culture== *The frog appears on the reverse side of the Venezuelan 5 bolívar soberano note. ==References== cruciger Category:Endemic fauna of Venezuela Category:Amphibians of Venezuela Category:Amphibians described in 1856 Category:Taxa named by Hinrich Lichtenstein Category:Taxa named by Eduard von Martens Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Atelopus cruciger"},{"id":"12358234","text":"Atelopus dimorphus is a species of toads in the family Bufonidae endemic to Peru.

It was described by George Albert Boulenger in 1882 based on a specimen collected by Edward Whymper. It is known in Spanish as rana jambato del Pacífico or simply jambato del Pacífico. ==History and taxonomy== The species was described by George Albert Boulenger in 1882 based on a female specimen collected by Edward Whymper during his expedition to Ecuador in 1879–1880. Toads from the Gorgona Island were described by Thomas Barbour in 1905 as a new species, Atelopus gracilis, but later authors have considered them to be the same species as Atelopus elegans. Analyses using molecular methods have not included Atelopus elegans, and the colour difference between the mainland and Gorgona populations suggests that the validity of Atelopus gracilis remains possible. Atelopus gracilis is sometimes recognized as a subspecies, Atelopus elegans gracilis. Illustration of the holotype of Atelopus elegans, collected by Edward Whymper during his expedition to Ecuador. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout–vent length. It has slender body with long head. Fore and hind limbs are slender with webbed fingers and toes. Tympanum is absent. Skin is smooth. Dorsal colouration is from dark olive green to bright yellow. Well defined black spots or blotches are always present on the back and on the limbs. The belly is yellow. Toads from the Gorgona Island are brown in colouration. ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Atelopus elegans are lowland and submontane humid rainforests. Recent Ecuadorian observations are from patches of secondary forest or from flooded areas and pastures next to secondary forests. It is very common on the Gorgona Island, but has seriously declined in Ecuador, possibly because of chytridiomycosis. Only one known population remains in Ecuador, in the Esmeraldas Province, and a captive colony has been established for conservation purposes. The species is also threatened by habitat loss. ==References== Category:Atelopus Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians described in 1882 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Elegant stubfoot toad"},{"id":"12358241","text":"Atelopus erythropus, the Carabaya stubfoot toad, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae endemic to Peru.

It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Reproduction and behaviour== Male with internal vocal sac Male territorial call To attract females and to defend their territories, males of A. franciscus use advertisement calls, not visual displays as typical for Atelopus. This is somewhat unexpected, given their environment is noisy and males must acoustically compete with males of several other frog species (e.g., Allobates femoralis and Otophryne pyburni). Moreover, this species lacks an external vocal sac, so can only produce low-intensity calls that propagate short distances (<8 m). It also lacks external tympana and could be considered anatomically deaf. Nevertheless, it has a well-developed inner ear and has been shown to respond acoustically to the calls of conspecifics in the field. Male territories are closely spaced, only 2–4 m apart on average, and despite the handicaps discussed above, acoustic communication appears sufficiently efficient at these short distances.

The reproductive biology is not well-known, but other Atelopus species are known to attach their eggs to the undersides of rocks in swift-moving streams during dry seasons when the water level is low. The eggs are laid in strings, and the larvae develop as the wet season begins.

Species have been rapidly declining throughout their range. About 75% of all known species from highland sites above 1000 m have disappeared, while 58% of lowland species have declined and 38% have disappeared. Worried about the effects of chytridiomycosis on this endemic Panamanian frog, the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project targeted A. limosus as a priority rescue species to be taken into captivity as an assurance colony at the Summit Municipal Park in Panama City. When the rescue team arrived at one of the last known upland sites at Cerro Brewster, they found many of the frogs were already infected with chytridiomycosis. The captive-breeding program has been successful. While the upland region seems to have been hard-hit by chytrid fungus, the fate of lowland populations of this species is uncertain, as chytridiomycosis appears to have more pronounced effects at upland sites. ==References== limosus Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1995 Category:Endemic fauna of Panama Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Atelopus limosus"},{"id":"12358310","text":"Atelopus longibrachius, the El Tambo stubfoot toad, is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It is found in the Andes of northern Peru (Amazonas and Cajamarca Regions) and southern Ecuador (Zamora-Chinchipe Province). Records from Colombia reflect the vagueness of the stated type locality, \\"Neu-Granada\\", encompassing territory part of several present-day countries. Other records outside the current range refer to other species. The most recent record of this very rare and possibly extinct species is from around 1995. However, there is a need to reassess the status of this species because of confusion with Atelopus podocarpus. ==Etymology== The specific name pachydermus is Greek and mean \\"thick skin\\". Common name Schmidt's stubfoot toad has been coined for this species, in reference to Eduard Oscar Schmidt who described the species. An alternative common name is Oyacachi jambato toad. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females, based on two specimens only, in snout–vent length. The snout is acuminate. The tympanic membrane is absent. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are webbed. The dorsum is covered by widely scattered or dense well-defined, rounded warts. The dorsum is yellow and has a dark brown pattern of marks, blotches and/or lines. The venter is white, sometimes orange or red. ==Habitat and conservation== Atelopus pachydermus occurs near streams in páramo and sub-páramo at an elevation of about above sea level. Breeding takes place in streams, and the species seems to depend on a permanent source of water. In Peru, Atelopus pachydermus was last recorded in 1994 or 1995 in the Cutervo National Park. The status of this population is unknown, but extensive agricultural activity is taking place within the park. In Ecuador, the species has been recorded only once in 1985, and later surveys has revealed no new observations. However, this record may be in error.

He remained in that position until 1873, when he was elected to replace Koti Badjuginov as \\"Lama of the Don Kalmyks\\" - the spiritual leader of the Kalmyk community in the Salsk District of the Don Cossack Host. Upon becoming the Lama of the Don Kalmyks, Arkad Chubanov promoted education among Buzava (or Don Kalmyk) youth. In his native Namrovskaia sotnia, for example, Arkad Chubanov established a parish school - the first official school for Buzava youth in the Salsk District and perhaps the first school for Kalmyk boys in general. Arkad Chubanov also compiled and published the Kalmyk lunar calendar. Arkad Chubanov died in 1894 after serving 21 years as Lama of the Don Kalmyks. He was succeeded by Lama Djimba Mikulinov, the Baksha of the khurul in the Ike Burul aimak. ==See also== *Buddhism in Russia *Buddhism in Kalmykia *Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov ==References== *Bormanshinov, Arash.

It has a restricted distribution, as surveys have confirmed. ==Conservation status== It is currently listed as Critically Endangered, in view of its small and fragmentary extent of occurrence and the fact that there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. The apparent declines of this species might in part be due to the modification of much of the Loja basin area for agriculture, urbanization, and other regional development. It appears that populations of this toad in the area surrounding Provincia Loja have been severely affected by human activities.

He served as Governor of the Gambia (1928–1930), British Guiana (1930–1935) and Jamaica (1935–1938). ==Life== Edward Brandis Denham was educated at Malvern College and Merton College, Oxford. Joining the colonial service as a cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service, he later served as colonial secretary of Mauritius (1920-1923) and acting governor of Kenya (1923-1928). He became Governor of the Gambia in November 1928, finding it hard to deal with the general strike called by the Bathurst Trade Union in late 1929. In January 1930 he left the Gambia to become Governor of British Guiana. He was appointed Governor of Jamaica by the colonial office in 1935. His short three- year stint was troubled with political and social unrest. There had been serious riots at the docks in Kingston and Falmouth in May and October 1935. 1938 opened with a cane cutters' strike on Serge Island Estate in the parish of St. Thomas. In response, Governor Denham fired off anxious telegrams to the colonial office in London. To head off trouble, Governor Denham appointed commissions to investigate wage rates and unemployment, followed by emergency public works initiatives. The Governor found the islands' problems complex and difficult to solve. Denham thought the real problems of Jamaica were less economic than political. The recent emergence of a group of well-educated mixed-raced Jamaican politicians posed the main threat to British colonial rule. Imperialism and democracy proved difficult to merge, but a system of democratic ruling of the Jamaican people allowed Sir Edward Denham to continue his rule of the islands. Denham died of a heart attack at Kings House, the Governors' residence, on the 2nd of June 1938. On Friday 3 June 1938 the crew of HMS Ajax (22) buried the Jamaican Governor's body at sea at sunset outside the three-mile limit offshore after his bronze coffin was taken to the ship on a gun carriage. King George VI sent a cable to Jamaica \\"I have learned with the deepest regret of the death in Jamaica of Sir Edward Denham. Captain General and Governor-in-chief. In him, the Empire has lost a public servant of long experience and distinguished ability. His death is a grave loss to the colony and will, I know, bring sorrow to the hearts of all my people in Jamaica\\". In 1944, six years after his death, Jamaicans were granted universal adult suffrage, an idea initiated by Governor Edward Denham. An area in the western section of Kingston called 'Denham town' is named after him and in his memory the Sir Edward Denham Memorial Prize is awarded at Royal College Colombo since 1939. == References == Category:1876 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Governors of the Gambia Category:Governors of British Guiana Category:Governors of Jamaica Category:People educated at Malvern College Category:Alumni of Merton College, Oxford Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Colonial Secretaries of Mauritius ","title":"Edward Brandis Denham"},{"id":"12358496","text":"The Amatola toad (Vandijkophrynus amatolicus) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to the Eastern Cape province, South Africa, where it is known from the Winterberg and Amathole Mountains. The specific name refers to the type locality, \\"Amatola Range, near Hogsback\\". ==Description== Amatola toads are small toads, with females reaching in snout–vent length. The dorsum is usually uniform dark grey or olive-brown with a distinct, pale, vertebral stripe. Parotoid glands are well developed. There are numerous small, flattened warts on the dorsal surface. The tadpoles are brown in colour. ==Habitat and conservation== Its natural habitats are high- altitude moist grasslands. Reproduction takes place in shallow temporary pools and seepages, including pools formed in vehicle tracks. The species is known to congregate in large numbers to breed. However, it was not observed in 1998–2009 despite numerous searches, and the species was feared to be extinct. In 2011, an adult female and many tadpoles were again discovered, on a site that had been searched before. Detection seems to require suitable weather, i.e., heavy rains that trigger breeding. The main threats to Amatola toad are loss of grassland through afforestation, overgrazing, and fires. Forestry vehicle use during the breeding season can be detrimental to the tadpoles and breeding adults. ==References== amatolicus Category:Endemic amphibians of South Africa Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Critically endangered fauna of Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1925 Category:Taxa named by John Hewitt (herpetologist) Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Amatola toad"},{"id":"12358501","text":"Rhinella amboroensis is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae that is endemic to the region of its type locality in the Carrasco Province (Cochabamba Department) of Bolivia and the adjacent Santa Cruz Department.

It is endemic to South Africa and found in southwestern and southern part of Western Cape Province to extreme southwestern Eastern Cape Province, from Nieuwoudtville in the west to Humansdorp in the east, along the coastal flats and Cape Fold Mountains from the sea level to asl. ==Description== Sand toads are morphologically similar to other Vandijkophrynus species, but can usually be distinguished by their unspotted white ventrum and bright yellow flush over the dorsal surfaces of their feet. ==Reproduction== Sand toads may emerge from their refuges to breed in winter, May–September, when heavy rains have saturated the soil and created pools lasting for many weeks. They breed in temporary depressions in sandy areas, and also in clay soils. Males call on exposed sites near the water's edge. Testes are unusually large, suggesting intense male-male competition. ==Habitat and conservation== Sand toads inhabit fynbos heathland. They can sometimes also survive in agricultural areas. The species is threatened by habitat loss and deterioration caused by coastal development, alien plants, and wetland drainage for urbanization and agriculture. It has disappeared from some areas, but is believed to be stable and common through most of its range. ==References== Category:Vandijkophrynus Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Endemic amphibians of South Africa Category:Taxa named by Andrew Smith (zoologist) Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1848 ","title":"Sand toad"},{"id":"12358516","text":"Nannophryne apolobambica is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It is endemic to the Arabian Peninsula and is found in Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Only nine species of amphibians have been found on the Arabian Peninsula, and this toad is one of only two species found in the United Arab Emirates. ==Description== The Arabian toad has a rounded head and snout, prominent eyes and small tympanic membranes. Its back is covered with small warts and it varies in colour, being grey, tan, brown or green, often with golden speckles. The male is generally smaller than the female. The long croak of the male sounds like a rusty door hinge. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. Its range includes several widely separated locations in northwestern, central and southwestern Saudi Arabia, the Farasan Islands in the Red Sea, western and southern Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and northern Oman. Its altitudinal range runs from sea level to about . It is a common species where the conditions are suitable and is found in oases, springs, irrigation ditches, watercourses, ponds and gardens. In the United Arab Emirates it is often found in mountain pools and may bury itself by digging holes in damp gravel in wadis. ==Ecology== The Arabian toad can be active at any time of day or night. It is well camouflaged and may hide in crevices, animal burrows or other concealed locations. It feeds on insects and small invertebrates, and sometimes larger toads eat small juveniles. It may consume small fish in drying-out ephemeral pools, swallowing them whole because, having no teeth it is unable to chew. This toad breeds opportunistically at any time of year in stationary or slow-moving water, depositing strings of black eggs in the water. Under adverse conditions, this toad can bury itself in the ground and aestivate, remaining dormant until rain falls or conditions improve. It has been known to aestivate for as long as three years at a time. Stimulated by changing conditions, all the toads may emerge at once and congregate in great numbers in suitable places to breed. The carpet viper and Brandt's hedgehog prey on the Arabian toad and seem to be unharmed by the noxious secretions it produces. ==Status== B. arabicus is a common species around suitable water bodies within its range and seems able to adapt to a range of habitat types.

It is named after its type locality, the capital city of Eritrea, Asmara. It is found on the Ethiopian Highlands on both sides of the Rift Valley, with the western population extending north into Eritrea. Its natural habitats are montane grasslands, and tentatively at lower elevations, arid savanna. It is a locally common and adaptable species that is impacted by habitat degradation, though probably without posing a serious risk. ==Taxonomy== Sclerophrys asmarae was first described from Ethiopia in 1982 by Tandy, Bogart, Largen, and Feener, who named it Bufo asmarae. It is one of only two known bisexual polyploid species of Bufo and has a karyotype of 2n=40. It seems to be closely related to Sclerophrys kerinyagae and the African common toad (Sclerophrys regularis) which are diploid species. The ranges of these three species overlap and because of its chromosome number, A. asmarae must have evolved from one or other of these species. Slight differences in voice and certain reproduction isolating mechanisms are evident between the three species. Further hybridisation is probably prevented by spatial constraints involving altitude preferences. ==Status== Sclerophrys asmarae is threatened primarily by human settlement and agriculture. However, it seems to be an adaptable species able to adapt to degradation of its grassland habitat by grazing.

The Oliver Stone film Heaven & Earth was based on the memoir. == Plot summary == The story began during Hayslip's childhood in a small village in central Vietnam, named Ky La. Her village was along the fault line between the north and south of Vietnam, with shifting allegiances in the village leading to constant tension. She and her friends worked as lookout for the northern Vietcong. The South Vietnamese learned of her work, arrested and tortured her. After Hayslip was released from prison, however, the Vietcong no longer trusted her and sentenced her to death. At the age of fourteen, two soldiers threatened to kill her in the forest. Once they arrived, both men decided to rape her instead. She fled to Da Nang where she worked as a maid, a black-market vendor, a waitress, a hospital worker and even a prostitute. While working for a wealthy Vietnamese family with her mother in Saigon, Hayslip had a few sexual encounters with the landlord, Anh, and discovered she was pregnant. She gave birth to a baby son at the age of fifteen. Several years later, she married an American contractor named Ed Munro and gave birth to another son. Hayslip left for San Diego, California in 1970, shortly after her 20th birthday. Hayslip's entire family was torn apart by the war: one brother fled to Hanoi, and did not see his family again for 20 years. Another brother was killed by a land mine. The Vietcong pressured her father to force Hayslip to become a saboteur. Rather than give into the pressure, he committed suicide. The memoir alternates between her childhood in Vietnam, and her return in 1986, to visit the friends and family she had not seen for so long. In Vietnam she was reunited with the father of her first child, her sisters, brother, and her mother. Her family was afraid to be seen with her because the tensions from the war were still present. Her memoir concludes with a plea for an end to the enmity between the Vietnamese and Americans. ==Critical reception== Hayslip's memoir was hailed as a previously neglected look at the war from the perspective of the Vietnamese peasants whose lives were upended. A review in The Washington Post wrote that, \\"to Americans, almost always, the peasants of Vietnam were part of the scenery of the war, no more.\\" The book was also praised for its message about the horrors of war. A review by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer David K. Shipler for The New York Times wrote \\"If Hollywood has the courage to turn this book into a movie, then we Americans might finally have a chance to come to terms with the tragedy in Vietnam.\\" The Washington Post reviewer wrote: \\"It should not be missed by anyone -- especially anyone who still thinks there is anything noble or glorious about war.\\" == Publication history == The memoir was first published in April 1989, with a tie-in edition to accompany the release of the film Heaven & Earth in 1993. == Film adaptation == Oliver Stone read her memoir when it was published in 1989 and felt that his look at the Vietnam War was incomplete without telling the story from the perspective of the Vietnamese. He optioned the book and the film was released in 1993. The film version was also based in part on Hayslip's second book, Child of War, Woman of Peace, about her adaptation to life in the United States. ==References== Category:Autobiographical novels Category:1989 non-fiction books Category:Asian-American literature Category:Vietnam War books Category:Literature by Asian-American women Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"When Heaven and Earth Changed Places"},{"id":"12358583","text":"Sclerophrys blanfordii is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

Endemic to the Sierra Nevada of California, the species ranges from the Alpine County to Fresno County. Yosemite toads are only found in the montane to subalpine elevational zone of asl. The Yosemite toad is similar to the nearby Western toad, but in many ways adapted to a high elevation lifestyle. It was initially described during the Grinnell Survey of California, by an undergraduate student of Joseph Grinnell named Charles Camp. ==Description==  Adults  Yosemite toads are medium-sized (48–84 mm SVL) stocky toads, with females averaging larger than males. They generally lack cranial crests, but males will rarely have weakly developed ones. Their eyes have a dark brown iris with gold iridophores. In comparison with the closely related Western toad (A. boreas), the parotoid glands are large, narrowly spaced, and irregularly shaped (oval or flattened), less than one gland width apart. Like the parotoids, the eyes are spaced narrowly apart, usually less than the width of the upper eyelid. The warts are large, smooth, and the dorsal skin between warts is smooth as compared to the Western toad. It is the most sexually dichromatic species of anuran in North America, with males and females displaying strikingly divergent patterns and coloration at maturity. Females are dorsally covered in black blotches that have white or cream borders, with a tan, copper, or ruddy background; males are more uniformly colored, ranging from yellow-green, to olive drab, to greenish brown, sometimes with scattered black flecks near warts. Juveniles resemble adult females, except with a thin mid-dorsal stripe, which gradually fades during development (faster in males than females). A prominent mid-dorsal stripe is lacking in this species, unlike the Western toad. As juvenile males mature, their black blotches shrink and ultimately disappear, whereas they expand and reticulate in developing females. Unlike other members of the A. boreas species group (A. boreas, A. nelsoni, A. nestor [extinct], A. canorus, and A. exsul), Yosemite toad males have a vocal sac and produce an advertisement call to attract females during breeding. The call is a high-pitched, melodious, flute-like trill repeated frequently. Charles Camp chose the specific epithet \\"canorus\\" (meaning tuneful) for the species based on its advertisement call. The trill contains 26–51 evenly spaced notes that last an average of 2.6 seconds.  Eggs  Yosemite toad tadpoles Eggs are darkly pigmented and laid in 1 or 2 strands (1 per ovary, the oviducts fuse just before the cloaca in toads), however egg masses may fold during deposition into radiating clusters 4–5 eggs wide. 1000–2000 eggs beaded in two envelopes are laid by females in shallow pools, tangled in vegetation. Individual eggs are 2.1 mm wide on average, and 4.1 mm including the two envelopes.  Tadpoles  Tadpoles are 10–37mm TL and jet black throughout, and hence the intestines are not visible ventrally. Their eyes are set dorsally (in contrast to the co- occurring Sierra chorus frog, which has eyes on the outline of the head when viewed from above). In contrast to the Western toad, the snout is shorter and blunted in lateral view, the tail fins are mostly opaque, the tail is deepest about halfway down its length, and the tail tip is more rounded. The labial tooth row formula is 2/3 (2 upper and 3 lower labial tooth rows), and the ratio of lengths of the last 2 rows is 1.6 (in Western toads it is 1.2).  Subadults  Metamorphs (recently metamorphosed tadpoles) are highly pigmented like tadpoles, and quite small, usually 9–14 mm SVL. Juveniles (1+ years in age) reach sexual maturity after 3–5 years (males) or 4–6 years (females), at which time sex-specific colors and patterns emerge. Until then, juveniles resemble adult females: they have a background color varying from brown to grey with generally unconnected black blotches encircling the warts. Unlike adult females, juveniles have a thin mid-dorsal stripe that is white or cream-colored, and orange tubercles on the undersides of their hands and feet. As juveniles mature, their black blotches expand and interconnect if they are females, or shrink if they are males, and the mid-dorsal stripe shrinks and mostly disappears. ==Natural history==  Breeding  Yosemite toads are explosive breeders (breeds within a short time period), migrating to breeding pools and flooded areas in late spring while snowbanks still veil the frozen meadows. They have been termed the \\"toad that stays on its toes\\" or \\"tiptoeing toad\\" due to their habit of crossing snowdrifts without touching their abdomen to the cold snow. Breeding time varies greatly with elevation and yearly snowpack (April to July), and depends on timing of snowmelt. Males arrive to breeding ponds synchronously when the meadow is ca. 50% covered in snow. Depending on the population density they will either join a breeding chorus by making an advertisement call to females, or will actively search for them. Their vocalization is a high-pitched, sonorous trill lasting an average of 2.6 seconds and repeated frequently. Males intermittently call from pool margins, under logs, or inside willows to attract females. When females arrive, they are immediately grasped in amplexus by one or multiple males as the males fight for a limited number of mating opportunities. Breeding sex ratios can be very skewed toward males since females breed less frequently than males, although both sexes typically do not breed in consecutive years. While in amplexus, females will lay one clutch of 1,000–2,000 eggs. Eggs hatch after 1–2 weeks, and the length of time depends heavily on ambient temperature and fluctuations in temperature. Females generally breed once and leave after 2–3 days, while males remain for 1–2 weeks.  Habitat use  Yosemite toad breeding pool (note \\"golf ball\\" texture) The species primarily uses montane and subalpine wet meadows for breeding, but will occasionally breed in ephemeral ponds, lake margins, or other riparian areas. Flatter, southwesterly meadows, with more precipitation, containing warmer waters seem to be favored by the species. More specifically, breeding takes place in shallow snowmelt ponds or flooded areas, and eggs are usually deposited in water less than 5 cm deep. Shallow water makes eggs vulnerable to freezing, because nighttime temperatures are particularly low during springtime snow melt off. Females will sometimes split their clutch into multiple areas, or deposit their clutch communally with other pairs in a single area. The relatively large amount of pigmentation in eggs and tadpoles is thought to help expedite development, and tadpoles will congregate in the shallowest, warmest margins of ponds during the day. At nighttime tadpoles settle down into the silty detritus where they are more insulated from the cold nighttime temperatures. This often gives their pools the appearance of \\"golf ball\\" texture, because tadpoles leave divots in the silt (see picture of breeding pool). It is not uncommon for a large number of breeding ponds to desiccate each season before tadpoles successfully metamorphose, hence there is apparently a selective tradeoff between shallow ponds (which accelerate tadpole development) and ponds with long hydroperiods (which ensure survival). Time from hatching to tadpole metamorphosis is 4–6 weeks, and this is highly dependent upon environmental factors (elevation, weather, food, competition) and possibly genetic background. Tadpoles are apparently unable to overwinter. Subadult and adult habitat use patterns are poorly understood. Metamorphs appear to move away from breeding ponds soon after transformation, however they probably overwinter nearby in stream channels and associated vegetation (willows, sedges, and grasses). Many juveniles (1+ years in age) probably disperse farther upland into adult foraging habitat, especially by mid-summer of their second year, but they can also be found nearby breeding ponds. Adult upland foraging habitat tends to be covered in seeps and springs, willows, tall forbs, granitic boulders, or (at lower elevation) forest clearings. Rodent burrows play an essential role in providing shelter from predation and weather, as do willows, logs, and rocks. Overwintering habitat is also includes the burrows of rodents such as pocket gophers, voles, and Belding's ground squirrels, along with willow root tangles, which all probably keep an optimal thermal and mesic environmental for hibernating toads.  Movement patterns  Yosemite toads show high site fidelity to both breeding and upland foraging habitat, often using the same breeding pools and refuges in subsequent years. After breeding, adults forage in upland riparian areas of the breeding meadows, or (less commonly) disperse into the surrounding forest or subalpine environmental matrix. Although adult toads are capable of significant dispersal away from breeding pools, they are generally found within 90 m of permanent water; occasionally they are found in xeric forest habitat. Female toads disperse farther than males, and have been found to move up to 1.26 kilometers from their breeding grounds in one season.Liang, C.T. 2010. Habitat modeling and movements of the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus (=Bufo) canorus) in the Sierra Nevada, California. PhD Dissertation, University of California, Davis. (September) 126 pp. However, dispersal between meadows appears to be very low, estimated to be about 2% between 400 m meadows.  Hibernation  This is possibly due to unfavorably dry habitat between meadow complexes. Overwintering sites are rodent burrows or willow thickets (see \\"Habitat Utilization\\"), and the first freezing nighttime temperatures seem to cue adult toads to seek hibernacula. Hibernation usually begins in the late summer or early fall, between September and October.  Feeding  Like other toads, Yosemite toads are ambush predators. They lunge at prey and open their mandibles, causing their sticky tongue to unfold, flip downward, and pull the animal into their mouths. Adult stomach contents have included: tenebrionid beetles, ladybird beetles, weevils, craneflies, mosquitos, caterpillars, carpenter ants, dragonfly naiads, centipedes, julid millipedes, and spiders. Juvenile stomach contents have included: ants, spiders, and wasps. Metamorph stomach contents have included: owl flies, flies, springtails, spider mites, and spiders. There appears to be an ontogenetic shift from eating mostly spider mites (metamorphs), to eating a mix of spider mites, spiders, and chalcid wasps (2 months post-metamorphosis), to eating mostly hymenopterans, mostly ants (juveniles), to eating 80% hymenopterans, consisting of bees and wasps (adults). Tadpoles are grazers on detritus and algae, however it remains unclear whether they ingest those items, bacteria, rotifers, or something else. Tadpoles are also known to opportunistically scavenge conspecific tadpoles, Sierra chorus frog tadpoles, Belding's ground squirrels, and predaceous diving beetle larvae, as well as graze on lodgepole pine pollen grains. Adaptations to high elevation Yosemite toads have several apparent adaptations to high elevation. Males live to be at least 12 years, and females until at least 15 years. Their longevity probably helps them outlast years of low snowpack that cause poor breeding conditions, and thus low metamorphic recruitment. They are largely diurnal in contrast to the majority of anurans, probably owing to the cold mountain temperatures. Aligning their activities with diel peaks in warmth allows them to absorb solar energy to catch and biosynthesize food. The high level of melanism in eggs and tadpoles (and possibly in adult females), as well as the tendency for tadpoles to congregate in the warm shallows, probably serves the same purpose. Similarly, the selection of shallow breeding sites by adults, and shallow water margins by tadpoles, probably reflects the intense pressure to metamorphose in a short season, and hence the importance of using high temperature for rapid development. The marked dichromatism between males and females is still an evolutionary mystery. One possible explanation sexual selection. Females could be sexually selecting for lighter coloration in males, as some kind of proxy for male fitness, or males could be signaling their maleness to attract females and ward off over-zealous males. Males of the Yosemite toad and many other bufonid species change into a lighter color during breeding (e.g. Western toads, American toads), and other notable high elevation bufonids outside North America are highly sexually dichromatic (e.g. golden toads, yellow toads, marbled toads). Another more likely hypothesis is that males and females occupy largely different habitats, and evolution has de-coupled camouflage between the sexes. Males spend disproportionately more time in shallow, brown, silty breeding ponds, where they are highly exposed to predators. In contrast, females quickly leave pond habitat for rocky upland habitat where disruptive coloration may be more suitable. More than 60% of adults toads found in upland habitat during the late summer are females, whereas less than 10% are males. In lowland breeding habitat, this pattern is reversed: 54% of adult toads are males, and only 19% are females. Regardless of which hypothesis is correct, their diurnal habits make color and pattern subject to increased selection.  Lineage diversification and fusion  Karlstrom was the first to hypothesize, based on the distribution of A. canorus in Yosemite National Park, that glaciers had helped the species differentiate from A. boreas. The idea was that repeated glacial action had helped isolate the species in montane areas, and gradual adaptation there had helped it competitively exclude A. boreas from high elevation terrain. Recent work has showed this is likely true, and part of a larger pattern of glacial action bifurcating the species into new lineages. The species likely originated in the early Pleistocene, and many of the glacial cycles since then have isolated toads into western and eastern refugia; here they have adapted to different climatic conditions, reinforcing the formation of new lineages. Where the lineages came back into secondary contact, they occasionally fused into additional hybrid lineages, in cases where pre-post-zygotic barriers were low enough to allow hybridization, but high enough to allow hybrids to become distinct from parental types. Four distinct lineages were discovered in Yosemite National Park, in addition to three fused (hybrid) lineages; two lineages were also found in Kings Canyon National Park. ==Conservation== Yosemite toads are reported to have declined substantially in distribution and abundance across their restricted range. Although threats to persistence of the species are less understood than in other California amphibians such as the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, the two most significant appear to be drought (increasing with climate change) and disease (primarily chytridiomycosis). Interactions between the two are not well understood. The species is listed as \\"Endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), \\"Threatened\\" by the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) under the ESA, and \\"California species of special concern\\" by the California Department of Fish & Wildlife (CDFW). ==SystematicsReferencesExternal links== *California Herps Guide *AmphibiaWeb Page *Paul Maier Research on Yosemite toads *US Fish & Wildlife Page *IUCN Page *Center for Biological Diversity Page *Sierra Forest Legacy Page Category:Anaxyrus Category:Amphibians described in 1916 Category:Amphibians of the United States Category:Endemic fauna of California Category:Fauna of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Yosemite National Park Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:ESA threatened species ","title":"Yosemite toad"},{"id":"12358631","text":"Rhinella castaneotica is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It is known commonly as the Tingi Hills toad and is endemic to the Tingi Hills of Sierra Leone. This species' taxonomic status remains uncertain and was considered to be a synonym of A. latifrons by Tandy and Keith (1972).Tandy, M. & Keith, R. 1972. African Bufo. In: Blair, W.F. (ed.), Evolution in the genus Bufo, pp. 119–170. University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas It may not be a valid species. ==Authority== The holotype of this species was deposited at the Field Museum (Specimen No. 109741). It is an adult male collected in the Tingi Hills of Sierra Leone on December 27, 1958, by J. I. Menzies. It was buried in sand beside a stream in a high plateau forest at about . Paratypes were also deposited at the Field Museum. They include specimen No. 83198 collected in North Kambui Forest Reserve, Sierra Leone and specimen No. 121839 collected in South Kambui Forest Reserve, Sierra Leone. Both are adult males collected by J. I. Menzies. ==Description== Amietophrynus cristiglans is a moderate-sized species with adult males measuring about from snout to vent. They have a distinct tympanum; a tarsal ridge; low, rounded warts on back and sides; elongate parotoids that reach the eye with a distinct dorsolateral edge; and a first finger longer than the second. The color of these frogs in life is clay above but darker on the sides with two indefinite transverse light areas, one interorbital and one sacral. There is a dark bar on the cheek below the eye and another from the eye to the rictus covering the tympanum as well as an interrupted interorbital dark bar and obscure dark markings on the back. The limbs have dark cross-bars dorsally and the rear of the thigh has 5-7 narrow vertical dark bars. The throat has a light dusting of melanophores and the vocal sac is black and visible through the gular skin. The whole ventral surface is yellow deepening to orange laterally and to crimson on the thighs. Once preserved in alcohol, the ventral surfaces are cream colored and unmarked. ==Habitat== Based on the collection localities, Amietophrynus cristiglans appears to be an inhabitant of high forest at moderate elevations. It is probably sympatric with Amietophrynus latifrons as at least one specimen of latifrons (Field Museum specimen No. 109742) was collected in the type locality of cristiglans. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Information on the specimens deposited at the Field Museum can be found in the Field Museum Amphibian and Reptile Collection Database cristiglans Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Endemic fauna of Sierra Leone Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1961 Category:Taxa named by Robert F.

It is endemic to the Arabian Peninsula and is found in Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.'' ==Description== The Dhofar toad is a small species and is quite variable in appearance, being greenish or some shade of brown and either uniformly coloured or mottled and speckled with darker markings. The tympanum, just behind and below the bulging eyes, is large, which contrasts with the Arabian toad, the only other amphibian with which it is likely to be confused, which has a small tympanum. The call of the male at breeding time is a sharp \\"kra-kra-kra\\", and this contrasts with the \\"rusty hinge\\" sound made by the Arabian toad. The latter is less likely to be found far away from water bodies. ==Distribution and habitat== One of only nine species of amphibian in the Arabian Peninsula, the Dhofar toad is found in Yemen, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It is also present on the Farasan Islands and other islands, and its altitudinal range is from sea level up to about . Its typical habitat is wet places, springs, pools, streams, canals, ditches, irrigated land, gardens and oases, but it is sometimes found far from any permanent water. ==Biology== This toad is largely nocturnal and feeds mostly on insects. It reacts to drought conditions by burying itself in the ground and aestivating, which it has been known to do for up to three years. When heavy rain falls, it emerges to feed and makes its way to nearby water bodies where the males call to attract the females. The eggs are laid in strings and the tadpoles develop with great rapidity before the ephemeral water sources dry up. ==Status== The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this toad's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\" on the basis of its \\"wide distribution, tolerance of a degree of habitat modification, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.\\" ==References== dhufarensis Category:Amphibians of the Middle East Category:Endemic fauna of the Arabian Peninsula Category:Vertebrates of the Arabian Peninsula Category:Taxa named by Hampton Wildman Parker Category:Amphibians described in 1931 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Dhofar toad"},{"id":"12358713","text":"Rhinella diptycha, sometimes referred to as Cope's toad, Schneider's toad, cururu toad, or rococo toad, is a toad found in northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, eastern Bolivia, and eastern and southern Brazil.

Males measure and females in snout–vent length. The parotoid glands are strong, as are the cephalic crests. The dorsum is yellowish in females and juveniles, with a light midline stripe and a regular pattern of black blotches; in the males the colouration is often a bright greenish yellow, with only a few black blotches. The belly is white and marbled with brown. The skin is scattered with blunt, thorny warts, especially in the males. Rhinella icterica is the most common toad species found in southeastern Brazil and preys on the yellow scorpion (Tityus serrulatus). It has been observed that Rhinella icterica possess the ability to eat scorpions without adverse effects on the toad. This may be due to Rhinella icterica toxic secretion (RITS) that ultimately acts as a concentration independent irreversible neuromuscular blockade. In the presence of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme there was there was inhibition of Rhinella icterica toxic secretion. Additionally, RITS acts as an inhibitor on the cardiac Na+, K+-ATPase pump. Scientists have concluded that the toxic secretion from the toad acts as an inhibitor of calcium pumps in the heart causing a twitching action, AChE, and Na+, K+-ATPase pump. This toad species has been found to possess a defense mechanism against predators. There are cutaneous glands that are scattered all over the body of amphibians that aide in respirating, water balance, and chemical defense. There are 2 types of glands: mucous and poisonous. The poisonous glands involved in the defense mechanism are called granular glands. They form glandular accommodations in the dorsal region behind the eyes, one on each side of the body. These are called the paranoid macroglands. When they are threatened, they inflate up their lungs and point one of the glands at the attacker. This opens the one of the glands to attack. When this region is pressed upon, poison is rapidly released. If bitten, the poison is shot into the predator's oral cavity mucosa, thus poisoning them. == Specialized cells == Rhinella icterica possess specialized cells found among the glandular cells in mucous layer of the esophagus. In addition, the stomach of Rhinella icterica has four distinct layers that shows the same pattern as the esophagus. these specialized cells are called the oxynticopeptic cells and are responsible for the production of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen Its stomach is made up of a simple epithelium of columnar mucous cells that is supported by well vascularized loose connective tissue. In mammals, the gastric surface is lined by mucous that is secreted by mucous cells. This is also observed in Rhinella icterica. The mucous cells in this toad species also produces neutral glycoproteins that are rich in galactose, galactosamine, and glucosamine residues. This is similar to other toad species whose mucous layer that serves to protect the surface of the stomach and is formed by neutral glycoconjugates. ==Habitat and conservation== Rhinella icterica is found in the Atlantic Forest, spanning southeastern and southern Brail, eastern Paraguay, and in the Misiones and Corrientes provinces of Argentina. When it is time for them to reproduce, thus species is found mainly in streams or ponds in large congregations. They get their food from hanging matter and submerged plants. This common toad occurs in a large range of habitats, from forests to open habitats such as Cerrado savanna, and including disturbed habitats. Breeding takes place from August to January in permanent and temporary ponds and streams. It is an adaptable species that also occurs in many protected areas, and is not considered threatened. Initially, these toads remained in the forested and less urbanized areas of Brazil. However due to more recent deforestation and the building of new roads, there has been a decrease in the ability for toads to access water which is necessary for their breeding. Because of this, the population of Rhinella icterica is gradually decreasing, causing an increase in the number of scorpions found in this area. ==References== ictericus Category:Amphibians of Argentina Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Paraguay Category:Amphibians described in 1824 Category:Taxa named by Johann Baptist von Spix Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Rhinella icterica"},{"id":"12358861","text":"Rhinella inca is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae that is endemic to Peru.

It is endemic to Egypt, where it is found from the Nile Delta to as far south as Luxor. Its natural habitats are swamps, freshwater marshes, arable land, urban areas, seasonally flooded agricultural land and canals and ditches. ==Taxonomy== Between 1909 and 1912, several specimens of a small toad species were collected near Alexandria and were sent to the British Museum, where they were identified as Bufo vittatus (now Amietophrynus vittatus). No further specimens were found. In 1991, a new species of toad was discovered by Baha el Din near Damietta in the Nile Delta which differed in several particulars from B. vittatus, which is otherwise only known from the vicinity of Lake Victoria, and the original identification was called into question. The new species was described in 1993 as Bufo kassassii, and has since been transferred to the genus Amietophrynus becoming Amietophrynus kassasii. ==Description== The Nile Delta toad is a small species, with females growing to a snout-to-vent length of and males to . The upper surface is a greenish-grey colour with dark blotches between the eyes, on the shoulders and hips, and usually a thin white stripe along the spine. The underparts are white, sometimes with dark specks, and the hips can have dark red patches. It has a long snout which is slender when viewed from the side, large distinct tympani (eardrums) and indistinct oval paratoid glands. The skin of the back is somewhat granular or may bear spiny warts, and that on the underside is slightly granular. The first finger of the hand is shorter than the second, most individuals have a red patch on the thigh, and males in breeding condition have an orange vocal sac. These and certain other characteristics distinguish this species from A. vittatus and from all other toads found in Egypt. ==Distribution and habitat== The Nile Delta toad was originally found in the Nile Delta in Egypt. It is a small, nocturnal aquatic species and is seldom seen, although its presence in an area may be known from the distinctive call made by the male. It occurs in swamps, rice fields and clumps of floating vegetation and has spread further upstream as reeds have become established along the margins of the River Nile and the canals associated with it. It is now present in Cairo and as far south as Luxor, where it is said to be abundant. ==Status== The Nile Delta toad has a total range of less than , and although it is familiar in dense populations, it is rarely seen. But it has adapted to inhabit rice fields and cultivated land as well as its natural swampy habitat. It is present in several protected areas and faces no particular threats, so the IUCN has listed it as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== Category:Amietophrynus Category:Endemic fauna of Egypt Category:Amphibians described in 1993 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Nile Delta toad"},{"id":"12358899","text":"Poyntonophrynus kavangensis is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

Father Robert Cooke, OMI, looked to the Sisters Oblates, who sent four sisters to establish a convent and school in the cellar of their convent. Many pupils were girls who worked in local flax mills and factories. By 1858 the sisters had raised enough funds to build a convent next to Mount Saint Mary's Church. More fundraising by the Sisters soon produced the £800 needed for new school buildings that were erected next to the Convent.

Bufo melanochlorus. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 21 July 2007. is a mid-sized species of toad with a crested head in the family Bufonidae. It is primarily distinguished by its very long first finger with respect to the other fingers. It is found in southern Nicaragua, in the northern Cordillera Central (central highlands) and on the Atlantic slopes of eastern Costa Rica, and in western Panama. ==Vernacular names== Frank and Ramus (1995) give it the common name dark green toad, Panamanian herpetologists Jaramillo and Ibáñez (2009) use wet forest toad or west forest toad according to Darrel R. Frost (likely a misspelling). A local Spanish name from Costa Rica specifically for this species is sapo Costaricense de la selva, but it also just known as sapo. ==Taxonomy== The first article about this species was published in 1875 by Edward Drinker Cope who wrote of the toad as a particular but unnamed variety of Bufo valliceps from eastern Costa Rica. It was described as a novel species in its own right in 1877 by Cope under the name B. melanochlorus. The holotype is a specimen (undesignated in Cope's original publication, but thought to be USNM30592) taken in Limón Province sometime before 1877 by W. W. Gabb. The specific epithet melanochlorus is compounded from the Ancient Greek μελανω (melanō), meaning \\"blackened\\" and χλωρός (khlōrós) meaning “(yellowish) green”. The English name invented by Frank and Ramus is thus a simple transliteration. In 2004 O'Neill and Mendelson moved this species from Bufo to Incilius, and while doing so split the taxon into two species, a western I. aucoinae and the nominate taxon. Earlier publications use Bufo melanochlorus. In 2006 Darrel Frost et al. moved the species to the old genus Cranopsis originally erected by Cope in 1875 with C. fastidiosus as the type species. It was controversial and this approach was not followed by everyone. It subsequently necessitated moving Cranopsis toads to the new genus Cranophryne as the genus name Cranopsis proved to have already been used by Adams to describe a mollusc in 1860. In 2009 Pauly et al. suggested that because the recent partitioning of Bufo had made the formerly monophyletic genus paraphyletic and that the new genera were too imperfectly defined to be phylogeneticly stable, as the large number of recent (officially mandated) name changes caused by Frost in 2006 was evidencing, and that the hitherto done genetic analyses were yet too vague to properly resolve relationships, thus Incilius should be treated as a subgenus of Bufo. Frost refuted these criticisms in a 2009 response. A phylogenetic analysis by Mendelson based on morphology, life history, and molecular data was published 2011 which recommending sinking Cranopsis/Cranophryne, Ollotis and Crepidius/Crepidophryne back into Incilius. Mendelson et al. (2011) suggest that this species is part of an I. valliceps species group, or more specifically in what they termed the \\"Forest Group\\" subgroup, including the taxa I. aucoinae, I. cavifrons, I. campbelli, I. cristatus, I. leucomoyos, I. macrocristatus, I. spiculatus and I. tutelarius. ==Description== Incilius melanochlorus are moderately large toads, with males attaining to in snout–vent length, and females to . There is marked sexual dimorphism, the females having more irregular dark colouration on their back and being larger, but the males having longer heads and more brawny forearms. The head is wider than it is long. The head is crested, with the cranium sporting well- developed, thin and high crests. This crest ornamentation consists of canthal, supraorbital, and postpreorbital crests, and parietal crests with transverse folds between them (other species have crests on other locations). The crests run from the nostril, behind the eye, to the back of the head. The skin of the top of the head is hardened and stuck to the top of the skull. Males have a vocal sac. The vocal slits which hide the vocal sac inside the throat are small and bilateral, the sac has a single lobe, and is large, heavily pigmented with a greenish cast, and when calling inflates fully to a round shape. The eyes are large with a coppery bronze iris and a black pupil, the top half of the iris lighter than the bottom half, with a thin, dark line separating the two halves. The tongue is long and thin. The paratoid glands are small, smaller than the upper eyelid, and triangular in shape, and the toad has a small tympanum. The hind legs are relatively short, as are the feet and the tibia, but the toes are long and have some webbing between them. The first finger is longer than the second. The fingers and toes have tubercles underneath them. Sometimes the tips of the fingers and toes are lighter- coloured, sometimes the same colour as the rest of the digit. The tarsus (heel) has two differently-shaped tubercles, one facing inwards, the other outwards. The dorsum (back) is very warty, but is covered in a smooth skin except near the shoulders and hips, which has small, low and rounded protrusions. The ventral side has a minutely roughened surface. The lateral side of the toad is bordered along the upper part with a row of light- coloured, low to medium-sized, sharp but rounded, spine-shaped warts extending from the paratoid gland to the groin. The upper surface of the hind limbs is covered in many large, pointed warts. In general the colour of this toad is brown or grey, mottled with irregular splotches of dark gray or black. There is a thin or thick, lighter coloured, mid-dorsal stripe down the back. The dorsal colouration is light brown, often with lighter brown or pale grey bands toward the sides of the back. In females and juveniles the dorsum has darker brown mottling. The sides are dark, with a broad, dark stripe below the row of lateral warts. The ventral surface has a yellowish base, while the throat and chest are black, and the underside of the lower jaw has white spots along the edge. The eyes have a tan-coloured, square-shaped patch below them, reaching to the lip. There is a mottled dark brown region from the eye to the edge of the paratoid gland, which appears somewhat like a mask. The legs are mottled with light and dark brown, with dark bars on the upper surface of the thighs. The juvenile is somewhat more brightly coloured. Call The call is a \\"short trill\\" with toads having a round, inflated vocal sac. The call is several seconds long, and is repeated several times, with the intervals between each trill lasting a few seconds. Similar species In the field it is most similar to Incilius coniferus, being most easily told apart by the length of the first finger of the hand being nearly as long as the third, longest finger in the species, whereas in I. coniferus the first finger is shorter. Incilius aucoinae is very similar, but males of that species are smaller, and this species has a black chest and throat, mottling on the flanks, transverse folds between parietal crests, cranial crests that are heightened vertically, and distinct pretympanic and preorbital crests. According to Jay M. Savage (2002) the call is similar to I. luetkenii or I. valliceps. ==Distribution== In the 1960s the range was considered to include Nicaragua, but in 1972 Villa stated all earlier collections from this country were to be considered misidentified specimens of Incilius luetkenii or I. valliceps. It was subsequently believed to be endemic to Costa Rica. In 2004 similar toads from the Pacific slopes of Costa Rica were reassigned to a new species, I. aucoinae. In Costa Rica it occurs throughout the northern section of the Cordillera Central at mid-latitudes, and throughout the Cordillera de Talamanca and the eastern Caribbean seaboard. As of 2008 it is unclear if I. melanochlorus also occurs on the Pacific slopes of Costa Rica, or if those are misidentified I. aucoinae. McDiarmid and Savage recorded it in 2005 in meadows of the Peninsula de Osa, extending the distribution to the Pacific slopes in the far southwest of the country. According to Pounds et al. in 1997, it disappeared from Monteverde, Costa Rica, in the late 1980s and then reappeared there in the 1990s. In 2004 the toad was recorded in Nicaragua for first time (correctly) in the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve by Gunther Köhler and his team, in 2009 it was also recorded from Río San Juan under auspices of an expedition by Köhler and in 2014 it was reported in Rivas Department on the Pacific coast by a Nicaraguan team. In 2009 the distribution was extended to Panama following Jaramillo and Ibáñez (2009). ==Ecology== This toad is nocturnal and insectivorous. The toads may become more active during light rain showers. Habitat The native habitats of this species are wet lowland rainforests and the lower premontane wet forests at elevations to about asl. Its favourite locations are near large streams and at the edges of forests. In the northeastern rainforests of Costa Rica it occurs from sea level to in elevation, with frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus being the few amphibians to occur at higher altitudes here. It is occasionally found amongst the leaf litter on the forest floor. Reproduction Reproduction happens during the dry season starting with the males calling from January to February from pools along rocky streams, or within of water. Males may call at odd times of the year. Males develop dark-brown nuptial pads on their first and second fingers during breeding season. Although some sources claim breeding (amplexus) takes place in large streams, according to Savage (2002) it occurs in small, somewhat rocky-bottomed streams which are at low water for the season. Interspecific relationships Male toads may share their pools with the larger Bufo marinus toads. Diseases The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has had no impact on this toad. ==Conservation== When the species had been less studied, earlier authors such as Bolaños & Chaves writing for the IUCN in 2004 mistakenly believed it to be endemic to Costa Rica. As such it was automatically added to the local Red List and considered threatened. It was described in 2004 as most likely not very tolerant of deforestation and siltation and pollution of its breeding habitat, but nonetheless it was downgraded to \\"least concern\\" in 2004. As of 2008 the IUCN describes it as \\"widespread and regularly encountered\\" and \\"common and somewhat adaptable with a presumed large population\\". It is regularly seen during the breeding period, and is common in wet forests at higher elevations at favoured habitats. It occurs at La Selva Biological Station, in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (if correctly identified) and throughout the Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica, and in the Indio Maíz Biological Reserve and Río San Juan Wildlife Refuge in Nicaragua. It is kept in an ex situ collection at the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center. ==References== melanochlorus Category:Amphibians of Costa Rica Category:Amphibians of Nicaragua Category:Amphibians of Panama Category:Amphibians described in 1877 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Incilius melanochlorus"},{"id":"12359002","text":"Mertensophryne melanopleura (common names: Kankunde toad, dark-sided toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It is endemic to the southwestern United States, where its natural habitats are temperate lowland forests, rivers and streams, swamps, freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, ponds, open excavations, irrigated land, and seasonally flooded agricultural land. ==Taxonomy== The Arizona toad was first described by the American herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1867. He named it Bufo microscaphus and the type locality was Fort Mohave, Arizona. It was commonly known as the southwestern toad and for many years, three subspecies were recognized, B. m. microscaphus, B. m. californicus and B. m. mexicanus. In 1998, the American herpetologist A. W. E. Gergus raised all three to full species status on the basis of allozyme evidence, allopatry and morphology. The large genus Bufo was split by Frost et al. in 2006, with the North American species being included in the genus Anaxyrus. ==Description== The Arizona toad grows to a snout-to-vent length of . The dorsal colour is variable but is often gray or beige with reddish-brown warts. The parotoid glands are oval and widely separated and there is often a pale stripe or patch on the head or spine. Juveniles are often salmon-coloured or greenish-brown. ==Distribution and habitat== This species' range is continuous along the Virgin River and its tributaries in southwestern Utah, and southern Nevada, and in locations across Arizona and western New Mexico. It is a protected species in Utah, Nevada and Arizona. Protected populations occur in the Virgin River and its tributaries in Zion National Park. The toads are usually found in sandy areas within about of streams, often in locations with flood channels and dense clumps of willow, or on nearby sandy terraces with live oaks and cottonwoods. In Arizona and New Mexico they sometimes occur at higher altitudes, up to about in forested areas in riparian corridors during rainy periods in summer. They also move into irrigated fields after the breeding season is over, and are found around reservoirs, ponds and other impounded areas. ==Behavior== Breeding takes place in backwaters, the edges of streams and side-pools. Trees and shrubs growing at the streamside include Fremont's cottonwood (Populus fremontii), willows (Salix spp.), and seep willows (Baccharis salicifolia). Breeding starts in late February in Arizona but does not commence at higher altitudes in Arizona and in Utah until several weeks later. The male's call is a trill lasting about six seconds. Calling males are often outnumbered by satellite males which opportunistically mate with approaching females. Amplexus takes place and a clutch of about 4,500 eggs is laid in shallow water. The eggs take three to six days to hatch and the development period of the tadpoles before metamorphosis depends largely on the water temperature. The tadpoles probably feed on algae and other organisms attached to underwater surfaces but the diet of adults has not been studied. The toads are nocturnal, spending the day in sandy burrows. They enter a state of torpor and remain underground from about September to February. They may live for four or five years and the main cause of mortality is probably predation, with raccoons (Procyon lotor), a medium-sized plover the killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and the wandering garter snake (Thamnophis elegans vagrans) feeding on the toads. ==Status== The population size of the Arizona toad is believed to be decreasing at a slow rate, probably due to human disturbance of their habitat, and in some localities, such as central Arizona, they are being replaced by Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii). One threat faced by the Arizona toad is hybridization between these two species. They occupy similar habitat but theoretically should not hybridise because they breed at different seasons. However the male Arizona toad has occasionally been observed to mate with the female Woodhouse's toad. The Arizona toad has also been known to attempt mating with the Great Basin spadefoot toad (Spea intermontana), the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the red-spotted toad (Bufo punctatus), the canyon tree frog (Hyla arenicolor), the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana), and the lowland leopard frog (Lithobates yavapaiensis). The Arizona toad has a wide range and is assumed to have a large total population. It is an adaptable species and able to tolerate some degree of habitat modification so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== * Category:Anaxyrus Category:Amphibians of the United States Category:Endemic fauna of the United States Category:Amphibians described in 1867 Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Arizona toad"},{"id":"12359014","text":"Mertensophryne mocquardi (common names: Mocquards toad, Mocquard's toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It resulted in an Ibelin victory and the successful relief of the siege of Dieudamour, an Ibelin castle on Cyprus. Frederick II, as regent for his young son Conrad II of Jerusalem, appointed five bailiffs to govern Cyprus much to the displeasure of the local nobility. This was greatly opposed by the Ibelin family and they, supported by the government of the king of Cyprus (a feudatory of Jerusalem) and of Jerusalem, made war on the five bailiffs. Initially successful in controlling the chief fortresses of the island, in the first half of 1232, one of the bailiffs, Aimery Barlais, conquered most of Cyprus save Dieudamour and Buffavento for the emperor. The Ibelins responded by trying to bribe the Genoese into an alliance with them by offering them commercial privileges at Cypriot ports as well as land grants. This failed, however. The Ibelins and Cypriots assembled a meagre force of 233 mounted men as opposed to the massive Lombard force of 2,000 horse. Their army was divided into five battles. Four were lined up under the command of Hugh of Ibelin, Anceau of Brie, Baldwin of Ibelin, and John of Caesarea. Balian of Beirut, though he was supposed to be with the rearguard, lined up at the front beside Hugh and Anceau. The rearguard was commanded by John I of Beirut and Henry of Cyprus. The Lombard vanguard was led by Walter of Manepeau, who charged as far as the Ibelin rearguard beforing turning around and leading his men at the fourth battle under John of Caesarea. They were repulsed and fled. The second Lombard battle made a successful charge at the force under Hugh's command, but the men of Anceau readily came to his rescue. After this, \\"battle subsequently developed as a series of confused individual combats, in which some great feats of arms were performed. . . . though carried out from a position of complete order, [the charge] had merely been the prelude to an untidy mêlée.\\"Marshall, 162. During the mêlée, Berart of Manepeau was dismounted by Anceau of Brie and seventeen comrades who dismounted to help him were killed by sergeants on foot before he recovered. The young Balian gained a reputation defending a pass from the Lombards. In the end, the arrival of between 50 and 60 sergans à pié (foot sergeants) from the town of Agridi was critical to their success. According to L'Estoire de Eracles empereur et la conqueste de la terre de Outremer: > \\". . . une chose y ot, qui aida moult a Chypreis: ce que il avoient sergens > a pié; dont il avenoit que, quant un de lor chevaliers estoit abatus, que li > sergent le relevoient, et le remetoient a cheval.

Following the battle, John of Beirut, with funds from Henry of Cyprus, hired thirteen Genoese galleys to aid in the siege of Kyrenia. == References == * Marshall, Christopher.

The species is endemic to the low-lying areas of the Cape Peninsula, the Cape Flats and the Agulhas flats of the Western Cape, South Africa. ==Populations and range== Two macro-populations exist, broadly referred to as the Cape Town and Overberg clusters. Its natural foraging habitats is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, falling within several vegetation types including Cape Flats Sand Plain Fynbos and Cape Flats Dune Strandveld. ==Habitat== The species is not restricted to pristine habitat as much of its historical feeding grounds currently fall under residential suburbs, hence leopard toads are often found living in suburban gardens. Breeding habitat includes swamps, freshwater lakes, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, urban riverine watercourses, natural ponds and garden ponds. ==Threats== It is threatened by habitat loss, as well as other urban obstacles and barriers such as walls, electric fencing, canals and roads. Introduced or exotic fauna and flora like ducks, fish and algae threaten the quality of breeding habitat and the breeding success of populations. Cape Town is an expanding city with a population of close to 3 million people. There is thus an inherent integration of urban wildlife and humans in the city, especially with regards to the western leopard toad. ==Conservation measures== thumbVolunteers thus play a critical role in conservation efforts for the species. These volunteers are mainly involved during breeding season migrations, which falls between late July and early September, timed with the arrival of the first post-winter warm weather. It is at this time when the highest number of individuals are threatened, as individuals cross busy roads to and from local breeding habitat. Large-scale efforts across the distribution incur over nights during this time to move toads over roads, collect data and flag down motorists. Since March 2011 road signs have also been placed at ten of these crossings to alert motorists. It is envisaged that the signs would encourage motorists to slow down and take heed of the amphibians, especially at night. ==References== * Directorate of Strategic Information. August 2003.

It is the only species known to practice reproductive necrophilia. ==Taxonomy== Illustration from Spix's original description The specific name derives from the Latin proboscis (elephant trunk), in recognition of the toad's prominent beak. It is a member of the R. margaritifera species complex. The species was first described under the name Bufo proboscideus by Johann Baptist von Spix in 1824. Spix collected the holotype specimen near the Solimões River during his journey to Brazil. It is now held by the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. In 2006, members of the Bufo margaritifera complex were recognized as the new genus Rhinella, leading to the current name. The merge of another genus into Rhinella left a different species sharing this name (homonymy), which was resolved by renaming the other species Rhinella boulengeri (now Dendrophryniscus proboscideus). ==Distribution== This toad is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and intermittent freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. It is common in parts of the Amazon rainforest. ==Characteristics== Rhinella proboscidea Males are 46–54 mm with smooth skin, while females are 46–55 mm with granular skin. The dorsal surface is reddish or dark brown, and typically spattered with black and brown patches. It has a triangular head with a pointed snout, and a brown to gray belly. This toad is mostly active during the day, sleeping on small seedlings and shrubs at night, but shows nocturnal activity during the breeding period. Its tadpoles are light brown and similar to other R. margaritifera tadpoles. The skin is highly toxic, but predation by a snake (Xenoxybelis argenteus) has nonetheless been observed. This species is an explosive breeder that reproduces in shallow pools off the edge of streams. The toads gather in these locations for two or three days, where they collectively fertilize thousands of eggs. A typical reproductive period is from March to May, but it could vary depending on rainfall. After heavy rain, choruses of as many as 100 male R. proboscidea calling for a mate have been heard. Males breed aggressively, approaching any nearby toad and attempting to steal mates from other males already in amplexus. These struggles sometimes result in the female being suffocated. The dead females may be subjected to necrophilia. Males use their front and hind limbs to squeeze the sides of the corpse's belly until oocytes are ejected. The oocytes are then fertilized. In one study, this behavior was observed in five different males. The researchers suggested that the necrophilia was a reproductive strategy, offsetting the fitness cost of the female's death. This would make R. proboscidea the only species known to practice reproductively functional, rather than accidental, necrophilia. ==References== proboscidea Category:Amphibians described in 1824 Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Rhinella proboscidea"},{"id":"12359143","text":"Bufotes pseudoraddei (Batura toad, Batura Glacier toad, or Swat green toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

One of the most remarkable features of this species is its small adult size relative to other toads. Adult male (left), female (right). Note the sharply contrasted ventral surface, the vocal sac on the male's throat, and the female's larger size. The male can be distinguished from the female by its clear white belly and a slightly distended, loose flap of skin beneath the mouth, which expands into the vocal sac. The female has a dark-spotted belly and lacks a vocal sac. == Habitat and distribution== The oak toad's natural habitat includes sandy pine flatwoods and oak scrub, open pine and pine-oak woods, pine or oak savanna with sandy soils, and maritime forests. They appear to favor open-canopied pine flatwoods with grassy ground cover.

It is mostly diurnal and spends much of its time burrowed into the loose soil of its habitat. It may remain in its burrow during the winter, often in hibernation. Breeding takes place in shallow pools that accumulate during heavy rains. The male expands his distinctive elongated vocal sac to produce a chirping call. The breeding season extends from April to October, peaking early on.Harper, F. 1931. A dweller in the piney woods. Science Monthly 32 176–81.

Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca, New York. Oak toad tadpole An average of 300–500 eggs are laid in short strands of 3 to 8 eggs each, with each egg about a millimeter wide. The strands are attached to vegetation, usually submerged blades of grass beneath the surface. Energy investment in producing this quantity of eggs is significant, and many females are found dead during the mating season due to the rigors of the process. Fertilization takes place externally, with sperm being released in the vicinity of the eggs.

Other predators include garter snakes and gopher frogs.Behler, J. 1979. The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles & Amphibians. New York: Chanticleer Press, Inc. As with many bufonids, the oak toad inflates its body in unkenreflex when confronted by a potential predator. It secretes toxins from its parotoid glands and urinates when threatened.

H., Carruthers, Vincent; A complete guide to the frogs of southern Africa. Pub: Cape Town, South Africa : Struik Nature, 2009 Dorsal aspect. Probable mature female. ==Taxonomy== Amietophrynus rangeri is a member of the family Bufonidae. It was described, in 1935, by John Hewitt of the Albany Museum, Grahamstown, from collections made by naturalist Gordon A. Ranger at his farm \\"Gleniffer\\" 3 km E of Kei Road, in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Among several other forms described from these collections was the Eastern Leopard Toad, Amietophrynus pardalis, which Ranger distinguished from the Raucous toad on behaviour and calls (according to his nephew, Mr Gary Ranger, \\"Gleniffer\\" was subdivided in the late 1930s and the portions renamed, including \\"Hillside\\" and \\"Rockdale\\", where there is a monument to the older Mr Ranger). Hewitt considered the Raucous Toad, along with most other large toads of Southern Africa, as subspecies of the widespread African Toad Bufo regularis (a species which is now considered absent from Southern Africa, predominantly occurring in subsaharan Africa north of the equator). In 1964, Poynton raised Bufo rangeri of Hewitt, 1935 to full species status, distinguishing it from co-occurring related forms. More recently, Frost and co-authors (2006) assigned this species to the new genus Amietophrynus, as part of a global revision of amphibian taxonomy based largely on DNA sequence data. ==Description== Its maximal size, snout-to-vent, is about 120 mm. It is a characteristically robust medium-large-sized toad, dorsal and lateral skin liberally sprinkled with wart-like protuberances. Colour brown-to-greyish with more-or-less paired dark-brown patches flanking the medial dorsal line. The dark patches on the head meet in a brown chevron on top of the head behind and between the eyes. The anterior dorsal skin of the head lacks dark brown patches. Like most typical toads, it has a large parotoid gland behind each eye. If injured it will exude whitish spots of venom on the parotoid glands; this can be hazardous to domestic dogs if they bite a toad. The underside is whitish with the gular (throat) area of males infused with yellow with a dark blue-black bar posterior to the gular. ==Call== The advertisement call, made by males in the breeding season, is a loud repetitive duck-like quacking. Groups of calling males generally space themselves along the water's edge, or among plants in the water. Males in chorus call antiphonally (with calls from different individuals alternating). ==Habits== It is fairly aquatic as toads go, commonly inhabiting ponds and dams and streams, though it seems to prefer running water and accordingly favours fountains and similar water bodies. It typically is shy, but like many toads it will visit houses and other places where insect prey are attracted to lights, mainly outside the breeding season. It then establishes itself in moist, sheltered spots such as behind flowerpots and becomes tame if not molested. It will eat practically any small animal, including small vertebrates, but mainly insects up to the size of crickets. ==Range== A. rangeri occurs in Lesotho, South Africa, Swaziland, possibly Botswana, possibly Mozambique, possibly Namibia, and possibly Zimbabwe. Its natural habitats are Southern African Mediterranean, Karoo, subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, arable land, plantations, water storage areas, and ponds. ==References== * Minter, L.; Harrison, J.; Tandy, M. 2004. \\"Bufo rangeri\\". 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

In the United States its range extends from near Mobile southwards to the San Cristobal Wash and the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and eastwards to the Mission San Xavier del Bac and the Altar Valley. In Mexico its range is from the west-central part of Sonora State northwards. Its altitudinal range is from . Its typical habitat is arid and semi-arid plains with grass, creosote bush, mesquite and saguaro. ==Behavior== The Sonoran green toad is nocturnal and little is known of its behavior outside the breeding season. It is thought that it may be fossorial, living underground for most of the year and emerging only in wet conditions, and it is not clear whether or not it estivates. Breeding takes place in July and August, the males appearing at breeding sites one to two days after heavy rain has fallen. The sites chosen are ditches, temporary pools, creek beds and cattle tanks. The males call from low vegetation within a few metres of the water. The call has been described as resembling \\"the buzzer on an electric alarm clock\\". When a female arrives in response to the male, they move together into the water, amplexus occurs and a batch of eggs is laid. The temporary waterbodies tend to dry up rapidly and it is thought that the eggs hatch within three days and the tadpoles develop to metamorphosis in two to three weeks. ==Status== The Sonoran green toad is inactive for about ten months of the year so information on it is limited. The population is believed to be stable as it has been redetected in most of its historic locations and has been discovered in a number of new ones. Females are sometimes collected for the pet trade or research but otherwise it faces few particular threats and increased irrigation may create new habitats.

They are played by hitting one spoon against the other. == Techniques == # Fire tongs style : A pair of spoons is held tight with concave sides facing out and with index finger between their handles to space them apart. When the pair is struck, the spoons sharply hit each other and then spring back to their original position. The spoons are typically struck against the knee and the palm of the hand. The fingers and other body parts may also be used as striking surfaces to produce different sounds, rhythms, rattles and visual effects. # Salad serving style: one spoon between little, ring, and long finger; the other spoon between ring, thumb, and index finger in such a way that they can be rotated with ring finger as the common axis. They can be hit to each other at the convex sides by gathering the fingers (mostly middle and thumb). # Castanets style, two in each hand one spoon held concave-side against the palm held down by the thumb, one between ring and middle fingers with finger tips in the concave side balancing the handle. They can be hit to each other at the convex sides by gripping with the middle and ring fingers. # One spoon held concave-side against the palm, and handle jammed tight under the wrist watch belt, another in between ring and middle fingers of the left hand hitting the latter castanet style, and a third spoon in the right hand hitting both spoons in the left hand, drum stick style. == American folk music == In the United States spoons as instrument are associated with American folk music, minstrelsy, and jug and spasm bands. These musical genres make use of other everyday objects as instruments, such as the washboard and the jug. In addition to common tableware, spoons that are joined at the handle are available from musical instrument suppliers. ==British folk music== As percussion, spoons accompany fiddle playing and other folk sets. An example is seen in Midsomer Murders Series 6, episode 2, where Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy plays the spoons at a house party joining a fiddle player who is entertaining the guests. He uses the first technique. The guests also contribute percussion by hand clapping in time with the music. The song \\"This Old Man\\" refers to a related concept, except with sheep bones (hence paddywhack) instead of spoons. ==Canadian folk music== In Canada, the spoons accompany fiddle playing in Québecois and Acadian music. Also, Newfoundland and the Atlantic Provinces popularly play the spoons at family gatherings. Playing the spoons in Western Canada is closely related to the Métis culture. ==Greek folk music== The spoons in Greece, as a percussion instrument are known as koutalakia (), which means also, spoon. The dancers hold the wooden koutalakia, to accompany with a variety of knocks their dance rhythms. The most of them, are very beautifully sculpted or painted. == Russian folk music == Spoons are often used in ethnic Russian music and are known as lozhki ( [plural]; Pronunciation: [singular]). The use of spoons for music dating at least from the 18th century (and probably older). Typically, three or more wooden spoons are used. The convex surfaces of the bowls are struck together in different ways. For example, two spoons are held by their handles in the left hand, and the third, held in the right hand, is used to hit the two spoons in the left hand. The hit, in a sliding motion, produces a typical sound. One can also hold three spoons in the left hand and put a fourth into the bot or the pocket. A fifth spoon is then held in the right hand and used to hit the other four. Finally, one can hold the bowl of a single spoon in the left hand and hit it with another spoon. In this style, different sounds can be emitted by holding the bowl more or less tightly. These wooden spoons are commonly used in performances of Russian folk music and sometimes even in Russian orchestras. A video of a choir performing a Russian folk song with spoon and balalaika accompaniment can be found below. ==Turkish folk music== thumb Balıkesir zeybek dance Kaşık (spoon) is a Turkish and Uzbekistan percussion instrument. The ones made from boxwood are particularly favoured. There are also different holding styles. # The handle of one is taken between the long finger and ring finger, fingertips into the concave part, The Concave part of the second spoon is leaned against the base of the thumb in a back to back position with the first spoon. This is the most popular method used mostly with two spoons in each hand, hands up, dancing. Closing the fist clashes the pairs of spoons to each other. Sometimes the tips of the spoon handles in either hand are brushed against each other to get a different sound. # The handle of one spoon is held by the ring finger, thumb, and pointing finger, the handle of the other spoon is placed behind the ring finger, but on the inside of the little finger and the long finger in a back to back position with the first spoon. The ring finger works like a hinge and helps to hold both spoons. clasping the fingers lightly causes the spoons to hit each other. This holding style is essentially the same as holding salad spoons for single hand serving; except for this purpose the spoons should not be back to back. # The two spoons are held back to back on either side of the right hands index finger, the tips of the spoon handles are held lightly with the little and ring fingers the spoons are then hit down to the leg, up to the inside of the left hand, left thumb and index finger hold lightly and let both handles slip through to get several spoon sounds in one up down movement, spoon tips are allowed to skip over several left hand fingers or folds of the left sleeve to get a repetitive roll. This is the most popular method when sitting. # The left hand holds spoons as in the first style, a third spoon is pushed under the strap of the watch, and the right hand holds the fourth spoon. This is used when sitting. == Musicians == * Duncan Campbell British Reggae singer, formerly the only registered spoon player with the Musicians' Union in the United Kingdom. * Bobby Hebb and Noel Crombie are well-known spoons players. * In 1994, Seattle Grunge band Soundgarden had a hit with the song \\"Spoonman\\" that features a spoons performance by street artist Artis the Spoonman. * British actor Sylvester McCoy, who most notably played the seventh incarnation of Doctor Who, is adept at playing the spoons, as evidenced during his tenure on Doctor Who as well as in his role in Ian McKellan's King Lear. * Sam Spoons, drummer of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. * Late Russian president Boris Yeltsin was known to enjoy performing with wooden spoons among his officials.Russia's Yeltsin known for gaffes, off-color jokes (Reuters) * Children's Singer, Eric Nagler plays the spoons. * Californian Músico, Sr. Coronar, a member of the San Joaquin Valley's Ojos de la Alma known for using spoons in traditional Mariachi. * Australian Deb 'Spoons' Perry, known for her striking style and enthusiasm, has increased Spoon popularity in modern Oceania. * Irish singer Lisa Lambe plays the spoons in Celtic Woman's songs \\"Teir Abhaile Riu\\" and \\"Dulaman\\" * Abby the Spoon Lady is a popular street performer in the USA who plays the spoons. * A. \\"Claude\\" Ferguson published a 35 page booklet, \\"You, Too, Can Play the Spoons\\".

It is found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, possibly Liberia, and possibly Sierra Leone. The toad's natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, plantations, and heavily degraded former forest. While it is a \\"least concern\\" species, it is threatened by habitat loss. ==Taxonomy== The African giant toad appears to be a species complex. Although it is found across western and central Africa, it does not have a single large area of occupancy but occurs in several separate populations. It has been proposed that the species should be divided into three separate taxa, two subspecies and a new species. The proposed subspecies are A. superciliaris superciliaris, found only in the western Lower Guinean forests extending along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Guinea from eastern Benin through Nigeria, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, and A. superciliaris chevalieri, found in the Upper Guinean forests of Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana, and the new species, Sclerophrys channingi, found in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter species has been described as a Batesian mimic of the venomous Gaboon viper. ==Description== The African giant toad is a large species with a robust body which is a broad ovoid in shape. It has a short snout, an unridged crown and nearly-vertical sides to the head. The eyes are set close together and the upper eyelid has a pointed edge drawn out into a triangular projection. The tympanum is indistinct but the parotid glands are large. The first finger of the hand is longer than the second one, males having nuptial pads on the first two fingers. On the hind limbs, the toes are short and partially webbed. The skin on the back is either smooth or may bear small warts. The upper surface of the head and body is pale brown, yellowish or pinkish. There is a backwards-pointing V-shaped black mark between the eyes and there are sometimes one or more pairs of dark spots on the back. There is sometimes a thin, pale stripe running along the spine. The sides of the head and body are considerably darker than the upper parts. The underparts are grey speckled with white and there is a thin white line bordering the lower jaw. The limbs are barred with dark bands on a greyish or brownish background and the back of the thigh, and sometimes the flanks, are bright red. The combined effect of this colouration is to make the frog resemble a dead leaf and it is well camouflaged when among the leaf litter on the forest floor. The new species differs from the two subspecies in that the posterior part of the abdomen is a darker colour, the line along the spine is dark and the eyelid processes are less-pointed. It is also distinguished genetically from them. There is a 2.2 to 2.8% variation in the 16S rRNA gene, the gene used for investigation, between it and the two subspecies whereas the subspecies are genetically more similar to each other (0.9 to 1.1%) than either of them is to the new species (A. channingi). A. s. chevalieri is the largest subspecies with adult males having an average snout-to-vent length of while A. s. superciliaris averages . The new species is shorter again at . Females are rather larger than males. ==Distribution and habitat== The African giant toad is native to tropical Central and West Africa. In the western part of its range it is rare and is found in primary forests alongside rivers, but further east it is found in both primary and secondary forests, in dense undergrowth and in cocoa plantations. Here it is more numerous but is still uncommon. Another view is that as this species is nocturnal and is so cryptically-coloured as to be difficult to discern, it may be much more common than is presently thought. ==Biology== Little is currently known about the biology of the African giant toad. Breeding probably takes place in the dry season, January to March. Clutches of eggs are laid in streams in areas of relatively calm water, the female probably depositing long strings of eggs wrapped around underwater vegetation. Juveniles have been seen in January in Nigeria, in March in Cameroon, and young toads less than long have been observed in February and the months between May and October in other parts of the range. Prey is likely to consist of invertebrates caught by the toad amongst the leaf-litter or in the water. This toad is known to consume ants and in captivity has eaten snails, insects, other frogs and tadpoles. ==Conservation status== The chief threat this toad faces is logging activities which degrade its habitat. This is particularly so in West Africa where it is restricted to primary forests. Elsewhere it seems more adaptable but is still susceptible to the loss of dense tree cover. It used to be collected for the pet trade and even though this is now illegal, it may sometimes still happen. The population trend is unknown, but because of its very wide range and presumed large total population, the IUCN has assessed it as being of \\"least concern\\". ==References== Category:Amietophrynus Category:Amphibians described in 1888 Category:Amphibians of Cameroon Category:Fauna of Central Africa Category:Amphibians of West Africa Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"African giant toad"},{"id":"12359255","text":"Bufotes surdus, also known as Iranian earless toad, Iranian toad, Pakistan toad, or Luristan toad (not to be confused with Lorestan toad), is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is found in southern Iran and western Pakistan. There is also an isolated record from eastern Iraq. ==Appearance and subspecies== Bufotes surdus is a medium-small toad with a snout–to–vent length of about in adults. Unlike most species of Bufotes but similar to its close relative B. luristanicus, it has no visible tympanum (either absent or tiny and covered by the skin), hence the common name \\"earless toad\\". It is typically quite dull and plain-coloured, but it may have some inconspicuous greenish markings, especially to the limbs, and occasionally a larger amount of small greenish ring-shaped spots. Two subspecies are recognized, but their separation is questionable (annulatus was described based on features that often are individually variable in toads) and require further study. Common name ring-spotted earless toad can be used to specifically refer to Bufotes surdus annulatus. ==Habitat and conservation== Bufotes surdus inhabits oases and pools in irrigated areas and their surroundings at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place during the monsoons when males gather in temporal pools. The eggs are deposited around vegetation in ponds. During the dry season these animals seek damp areas under stones and within vegetation. It can be a locally common species, but its ecology is little known and it has sometimes been confused with juveniles of other Bufotes species. It is threatened by intensification of agriculture, including agricultural pollution. Extended periods of drought can cause local population declines. Some populations occur within protected areas. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Toads of Pakistan surdus Category:Amphibians of Iran Category:Amphibians of Iraq Category:Amphibians of Pakistan Category:Amphibians described in 1891 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Bufotes surdus"},{"id":"12359263","text":"Incilius tacanensis (common name: Volcan Tacana toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It is endemic to Uganda, where it is only known from Lira south to Entebbe and the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. This species may possibly be found in Kenya and its range may even extend into Egypt, but the records from northern Egypt are generally regarded as belonging to S. kassasii. ==Description== Sclerophrys vittata is a small toad with long, narrow parotoid glands, distinctive dark-coloured longitudinal stripes and rows of large tubercles on its upper surface, and a bold patterning of red and dark blotches on its underside. In Egypt the snout vent length of the toads varied between 26 and 36 millimeters. No difference was found between males and females concerning body length.Mamdouh Saad Ahmed Akef, Hans Schneider: Reproductive behavior and mating call pattern in Degen's toad, Bufo vittatus, in Egypt (Bufonidae, Amphibia). In: African Journal of Zoology, Volume 107, 1993, S. 97−104. ==Distribution== Sclerophrys vittata is found in Uganda and was first described by George Albert Boulenger in 1906. Its range extends from Lira southwards to Entebbe and the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. It has also been reported from Katera in the southern foothills of Mount Kenya, but this record is disputed. Some toads found between 1909 and 1912 near Alexandria in Egypt were originally identified as this species but may have been misidentified. From 1989 to 1991, Akef and Schneider investigated the reproductive behavior and analyzed the calls of Bufo vittatus in Egypt in the Al−Fayoum region. In 1993 a new species of toad was described by Sherif Baha el Din from the Nile Delta as Bufo kassasii, and it is thought the original identification of Sclerophrys vittata from Egypt referred to this new species, also known as the Nile Delta toad. However, it is possible that this species has a wider range including parts of the Nile Valley and into Egypt. == Calls and calling activity ==  Calls  The mating calls have a simple structure. They consist of three to four very short pules separated by intervals. Calls have been recorded at water temperatures of 17 to 27 degrees Celsius. At 24 degrees water temperature the mean call duration measures 120 milliseconds, the intercall interval 300 milliseconds, the calls exhibit two frequency components at about 1100 and 2800 Hertz. There is a correlation between the water temperature and some call parameters. As the water temperature increases the duration of the calls decreases when the calls consisting of three or four pulses are considered separately. The intervals between the calls and between the pulses also decrease, whereas the pulse rate increases. The number of pulses per call and the duration of the pulses do not change.  Annual and daily calling activity  Calling of the males begins in the first half of February and lasts until October. It reaches a climax in spring and early summer. During this time calling begins shortly after sunset and lasts until 1 to 2 a.m. Later in summer calling ends earlier, around 10 to 11 p.m. and ends in September and October even earlier.  Calling behaviour  Calling males gather in small shallow ponds, irrigation canals and ditches, rice and corn fields. They form choruses consisting of about 20 males. The calling males maintain a minimum distance of about 0.7 meters. At decreasing calling activity during the year, males continue to form choruses, but the number of choruses decreases. Males call while sitting in the water, the body is erected, the hind limbs and the posterior part of the body are immersed in the water. The males have a single subgular vocal sac. When fully inflated, it is very large in relation to the body length. Pair formation is high in spring and early summer, later on it decreases, but pairs are observed until October. ==Status== Very little is known about this species and its natural history. It inhabits marshy areas and presumably its larvae are aquatic. Its population status, ecology and the threats it faces are unknown and the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists its conservation status as \\"data deficient\\". ==References== vittata Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Uganda Category:Endemic fauna of Uganda Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Amphibians described in 1906 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Sclerophrys vittata"},{"id":"12359354","text":"The subdesert toad (Amietophrynus xeros) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

Other common names include Rose's mountain toadlet, striped mountain toad, Rose's toad, and Muizenberg Cape toad. It is endemic to South Africa, where its natural habitat is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation known as fynbos. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Description== Female Cape mountain toads grow to a length around , while males are smaller at . The body is relatively long, the hind limbs are short, and the toes are unwebbed. The dorsal surface is variably coloured in shades of grey or brown with a few paler streaks, and is smooth with scattered warts and blister-like ridges. The parotoid glands are obvious, but no tympani (eardrums) are visible, a fact which helps distinguish this species from the otherwise similar Capensibufo tradouwi. The ventral surface is white with dark blotches, and its posterior part has skin granulations. During the breeding season, an oval pink patch is seen underneath the vent. ==Distribution and habitat== Typical mountain fynbos habitat The Cape mountain toad is endemic to parts of the Western Cape province of South Africa, southwest of the Breede River and including the Cape Peninsula. This is a hilly area and has a Mediterranean-type climate with a rainy season in the winter. It has a distinctive, heathland vegetation known as fynbos, characterised by small evergreen, sclerophyllous plants including proteas and ericoid species, herbs, bulbous plants, and grasses, but not large trees. The Cape mountain toad is found at elevations of between above sea level, mostly at altitudes above . ==Biology== Breeding takes place at the time of the winter rains when temporary shallow pools form. The males do not call to attract females, and this may be the only South African species of amphibian that lacks a voice. About one hundred eggs are laid in a gelatinous string and take about twelve days to hatch. The rate of growth of the tadpoles depends on the temperature and availability of food and metamorphosis into juvenile toads may occur about six weeks after hatching. ==Status== It is only found in fynbos heathland on the Cape and it does not seem to be adaptable to the changes in habitat associated with an increase in nonlocal plants and burning of the heathland that sometimes occurs. Although it is locally common at temporary pools in the breeding season, it occupies only about 2% of the suitable habitat in its range, is known from only two localities and is absent from many areas that seem suitable, including some where it was found in the past. A disjunct population of Capensibufo rosei was initially discovered on Table Mountain in the year 1927.

The Gators and Vols have competed in the same athletic conference since Florida joined the now-defunct Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1910, and the schools were founding members of the Southeastern Conference in 1932. Despite this long conference association, a true rivalry did not develop until the early 1990s due to the infrequency of earlier meetings; in the first seventy-six years (1916–91) of the series, the two teams met just twenty-one times. The Southeastern Conference (SEC) expanded to twelve universities and split into two divisions in 1992. Florida and Tennessee were placed in the SEC's East Division and have met on a home- and-home basis every season since. Their rivalry quickly blossomed in intensity and importance in the 1990s and early 2000s as both programs regularly fielded national championship contending teams under coaches Phil Fulmer of Tennessee and Steve Spurrier at Florida. Tennessee dominated the rivalry's early years, winning the first ten meetings and building a 13–2 series lead after their victory in the 1971 game. Florida has held the advantage since then, especially since the schools became SEC East rivals in 1992. After winning in 2019, Florida leads the all-time series 29–20. == Schedule == Florida and Tennessee's football teams first met in 1916, when both schools were members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. They each joined the Southern Conference in the 1920s, and were founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1932. Despite these common affiliations, a true rivalry did not develop between the programs for a long time because they played so sparingly. For many years, the SEC allowed schools to arrange their own conference schedules, which sometimes resulted in unusual or imbalanced conference slates that varied according to traditional opponents and the university's athletic budget. The University of Tennessee is located in Knoxville and the University of Florida is in Gainesville, which are approximately 550 miles apart. Between the cost and time required to travel by train and the fact that the SEC did not require members to play each other very often, the two schools met on the gridiron only thirteen times between 1916 and 1969. Of those thirteen games, seven were played in Knoxville, two were played in Gainesville, and four were played in other locations in Florida. The SEC became a 10-member league in the late-1960s, and a new scheduling system had the Gators and Vols play seven times over the next 21 seasons. The SEC became a 12-member league in 1992 and split into two divisions. Both Florida and Tennessee were placed in the SEC's Eastern Division, and they have met annually ever since. Florida and Tennessee have played on the third Saturday of September almost every year since 1992, giving the rivalry its nickname. Notable exceptions were in 2001, when the game was postponed until December 1 due to the September 11 terrorist attacks, and in 2014, when the addition of two new members to the SEC temporarily scrambled the dates of many traditional conference rivalries and moved the Florida–Tennessee game to October. The rivalry has sometimes served as the conference opener and is often the first significant test of the season for one or both of the teams.  Other sports  As long-time members of the same conference, Tennessee and Florida have long competed in many other sports besides football. Men's basketball in particular became a heated rivalry for a time in the mid- to late-2000s, when coach Bruce Pearl's Volunteer squads challenged coach Billy Donovan's national championship-winning Gator teams for supremacy in the SEC's Eastern Division. However, the basketball rivalry cooled after Pearl left Tennessee in 2011 (Pearl is currently head coach of another SEC school, Auburn) and Donovan left Florida in 2015, and the schools' football rivalry has consistently received more attention from fans and media over the years. == Series history ==  Early history  Tennessee dominated the early series, winning their first 10 meetings with Florida over a span of 37 years (1916–53). The highlight of this period was a 1928 season-ending matchup between undefeated squads in Knoxville that the Volunteers won 13–12. Florida finally beat Tennessee in 1954, winning 14–0 in Knoxville, but Tennessee won the return visit to Gainesville the following year, which was the first time that the teams played at Florida Field. Florida and Tennessee would not meet again for fourteen years, the longest gap in the series. They next faced off in the 1969 Gator Bowl. In that highly unusual post-season matchup between conference foes, Florida won 14-13, then hired away the Tennessee's head coach, former Gator quarterback Doug Dickey. At the conclusion of the 1960s, Tennessee owned an 11–2 all-time record against Florida.  1970s and 1980s  Doug Dickey was Florida's starting quarterback, then Tennessee's head coach, then Florida's head coach, and finally Tennessee's athletic director Tennessee won their first two clashes against Dickey's Gators, and Florida won the next two, including a 1976 victory in Gainesville that was their first home win against the Vols in four tries. Dickey resigned as Florida's coach after the 1978 season, ending a largely disappointing tenure at Florida and eventually returning to Knoxville in 1985 to become Tennessee's athletic director. Florida ran their win streak over Tennessee to four games (over nine seasons) with wins in Knoxville and Gainesville in 1984 and 1985 as they topped the SEC standings in both years. However, Florida would not be officially recognized for those championships, as the program was put on NCAA probation during the 1984 season due to violations committed under former coach Charley Pell. Though SEC's executive committee had initially ruled that Florida could keep their first ever conference championship, the university presidents later overturned the decision and vacated the title. Florida President Marshall Criser and the university community were incensed by this reversal, and many blamed the University of Tennessee for leading the movement to strip UF's first conference championship. On the field, Florida held a 4–2 advantage during the 1970s and 80s.  1990s  Tennessee and Florida rotated back onto each other's schedule in 1990, which was coincidentally the same year that former Florida quarterback Steve Spurrier returned to Gainesville as the Gators' new head ball coach. Spurrier had spent most of his youth in Tennessee, and his return to the state was marred by a 45-3 Vols rout in 1990, the largest margin of victory in series history. Florida won the return game in Gainesville in 1991 on their way to their first official conference championship.  SEC East rivals  One result of the SEC's 1992 expansion and split into divisions was the beginning of an annual match-up between Florida and Tennessee at a time when both programs rose to national prominence. Under head coaches Steve Spurrier and Phillip Fulmer, the Gators and Volunteers were annual contenders for conference and national championships, with both teams usually fielding wide-open offenses led by top quarterbacks such as Danny Wuerffel and Peyton Manning, among many other highly decorated players on both sides of the ball. Their first match-up as permanent opponents in 1992 helped to sow the seeds of rivalry, as the underdog Vols beat the defending SEC champion Gators in Neyland Stadium. Fulmer had been serving as UT's interim head coach while Johnny Majors recovered from heart problems, but his team's upset of the Gators helped to secure him the permanent position and brought about a decade of games in which the rivalry was one of the key match-ups of every college football season. The Gators turned the tables and upset the Volunteers in 1993, with true freshman Wuerffel outplaying Heisman trophy candidate Heath Shuler in a 41–34 win that was Fulmer's first loss as Tennessee's head coach. The rivalry held national championship implications over each of the following seasons, with both teams entering the contests ranked in the top 10 every year. Though they were not always the favorite, Florida won five straight against Tennessee from 1993 to 1997, winning four SEC titles and a consensus national championship in 1996. The 1994, 1995, and 1996 contests featured match-ups between starting quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Peyton Manning, who never beat Florida during his celebrated college career. But though Florida beat Tennessee in 1997, upset losses to LSU and Georgia propelled Tennessee to their own SEC championship in Manning's senior year. Tennessee broke Florida's winning streak in 1998 with a 20–17 overtime win and went on to win their second straight SEC championship and a national championship. In 1999, Florida upset the Vols in Gainesville to close out the decade. During the 1990s, Florida and Tennessee combined to win eight conference and two national championships, and either the Gators or the Volunteers represented the SEC East in each of the first ten SEC Championship games. Both teams were ranked in the top 10 for eight out of their ten contests during the decade, and neither team ever entered their rivalry game ranked lower than No. 15. Florida held a 7–3 record against Tennessee from 1990 to 1999.  2000s  2007 Game Florida began the next decade with a 27–23 victory in Knoxville in front of a national record crowd of 108,768 fans. During the following season, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks postponed all NCAA Division-I football games that were scheduled to be played on the following Saturday. The Florida and Tennessee match-up was rescheduled for December, and the Vols upset the Gators in Gainesville, winning on Florida Field for the first time since 1971. Steve Spurrier left Florida for the NFL after the 2001 season, but two trends in the rivalry continued in 2002: both teams were ranked in the top 10, and new Florida coach Ron Zook led the Gators to another win in Knoxville. However, both teams stumbled later in the season, and for the first time ever, neither would represent the SEC's Eastern Conference in the SEC Championship Game. The 2002 contest would be the last time to date in which both schools would enter their annual clash ranked in the top 10. For the first time since the division rivalry began 11 years earlier, the 2003 match-up featured UF and UT teams that were each ranked out of the top 10 (UT No. 12, UF No. 17), and the game was relegated to a noon kickoff on CBS. Tennessee pulled away in the second half to win 24–10 for their second victory in Gainesville. The Vols were victorious against Florida again in 2004 for their 2nd straight win against Florida and their third victory in four meetings. Ron Zook was fired during the 2004 season, and new Gator coach Urban Meyer put an emphasis on defending their home turf. Florida's 16–7 home win over Tennessee in 2005 helped to revive the program and started a Gator win streak in the rivalry that would span over a decade. Meyer's Gators beat Fulmer's Volunteers again in 2006 and 2007, and while Florida was SEC and national champions in 2006, Tennessee reached the SEC championship game in 2007. Florida won 30–6 in Knoxville in 2008 on their way to another SEC and national championship season. After Tennessee recorded its second losing season within a four-year span, Fulmer resigned as the Vols' head coach. Gator fans are encouraged to wear blue when Florida plays Tennessee to stand out from orange-clad Volunteer fans. Lane Kiffin replaced Fulmer as Tennessee's coach in 2009. He verbally sparred with Gators coach Urban Meyer in the months leading up to their first meeting, but the Gators beat the Volunteers in Gainesville in 2009, and Kiffin left Tennessee after the season. From 2000 to 2009, Florida again held a 7–3 advantage over Tennessee.  2010s  Urban Meyer left Florida after the 2010 season, and while the program suffered through sub-par seasons under coach Will Muschamp (who was the Gators' coach from 2011 to 2014) their win streak over Tennessee continued during the first half of the decade. The Volunteers simultaneously suffered through some sub-par seasons of their own under coaches Derek Dooley (Tennessee's coach from 2010 to 2012) and Butch Jones (who arrived in 2013). The Gators ran their series win streak to eleven with a 28–27 comeback win in Gainesville in 2015, the first year under newly appointed head coach Jim McElwain. The 2016 and 2017 would also feature second half comebacks. Tennessee came back from a 21-0 first half deficit in 2016 to beat the Gators and end Florida's series-long winning streak at 11 games, and Florida won in 2017 with a Hail Mary pass on the last play of the game. While the rivalry was still important to both schools, it lacked its previous national impact and attention during the first half of the decade. In 2013, both Tennessee and Florida failed to qualify for a bowl game during the same season for the first time since 1978. In 2014 and 2015, both teams came into their game unranked, something that had not happened since the 1950s. Both programs showed glimmers of improvement in the middle of the decade under coaches McElwain and Jones. Florida made back to the SEC Championship Game in 2015 and 2016, and both Florida and Tennessee were ranked in the AP top 25 coming into their 2016 and 2017 meetings. However, both the Gators and Vols faded to losing records in 2017, and both programs dismissed their once-promising head coaches before the end of the season. New coaches Dan Mullen of Florida and Jeremy Pruitt of Tennessee met in 2018 and 2019, both Gator victories. Florida amassed a 9–1 record against Tennessee during the 2010s. == Game results  Notable games ==  1928: Unbeatens in the mud  Coming into their 1928 regular season finale, the Gators under head coach Charlie Bachman held an 8–0 record and had outscored their opponents by a nation-leading margin of 324–31. Coach Robert Neyland's Vols had been dominant as well; they were quarterbacked by Bobby Dodd and had outscored their opponents 236–39 and held an 8–0–1 record—the only blemish being a scoreless tie with Kentucky. Still, the Gators were favorites when the teams met in early December, and rumor had it that they would be in line for a Rose Bowl invitation had they prevailed in Knoxville. They did not. Stymied by a stingy Vol defense and two failed point after touchdown attempts, the Gators fell, 13–12. In what would become a trend in the series, controversy swirled around the contest. By all accounts, the playing surface had been a muddy mess. Some Gators claimed that the home team had watered down the field in an effort to slow down the speedy Gator stars, including halfbacks Red Bethea, Carl Brumbaugh and Royce Goodbread; fullback Rainey Cawthon, quarterback Clyde Crabtree, end Dutch Stanley, and Florida's first-ever first-team All-American, end Dale Van Sickel The Vols protested that the sloppy conditions were simply the result of heavy rain the night before the game. The teams would not become regular opponents for decades, and the Gators would not earn its first victory over the Vols for nearly a quarter century. 1930: Dodd's final game In the final game of Bobby Dodd's playing career, Tennessee defeated Florida in Jacksonville 13-6\\\\. Buddy Hackman scored both of Tennessee's touchdowns. An account of Dodd's trickery: \\"Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school. When the ball was snapped, it was placed on the ground unattended. The players ran in one direction. Then the center returned, picked up the ball, and waltzed to the winning touchdown.\\" This play would later come to be popularly known as the \\"fumblerooski\\", after Nebraska famously used it in the 1984 Orange Bowl versus Miami.  1969–70: Coaching carousel  The 9–1 SEC champion Vols and the 8–1–1 Gators were not on each other's schedule in 1969. However, they were invited to play in the 1969 Gator Bowl, setting up a rare all-SEC bowl matchup and the only time the squads have faced off outside of the regular season. The expected high-scoring battle featuring UF's \\"Super Sophs\\" passing attack against UT's powerful ground game led by quarterback Bobby Scott never materialized,\\"Gator Aerial Whiz Kids Face Rugged Vols in Gator Bowl\\" AP, December 27, 1969 as both defenses were superb in the Gators' 14–13 win. Quarterback John Reaves connected with wide receiver Carlos Alvarez for the Gators' only offensive touchdown, and the Gator defense stopped the Vols at Florida's one-yard line late in the game to preserve the victory. Fittingly, the game's MVP was a defensive player – Florida linebacker Mike Kelley, who had an interception, a fumble recovery, a blocked punt recovered for a TD, a sack, and 17 tackles. However, the 1969 Gator Bowl is much more memorable for the coaching changes and rumors of coaching changes that surrounded the contest. Throughout December 1969, rumors had been circulating that Florida's head coach and athletic director Ray Graves, who had been the captain of Tennessee's 1941 football team, would retire from coaching at the conclusion of the season to become UF's full-time AD.\\"Doug Dickey May Switch to Florida\\" AP, December 24, 1969 Though both Graves and university officials denied the rumor, speculation among fans, players, and media was that Graves would leave the sideline and popular defensive coordinator Gene Ellenson would be promoted to head coach.\\"Gators Wanted Ellenson as Head Coach\\" Palm Beach Post, January 1, 1970 The situation intensified in the days preceding the game when word leaked out that Vol head coach Doug Dickey, who had been Florida's starting quarterback in the early 1950s and had grown up in Gainesville, planned to leave UT and replace Graves at UF after their respective teams met in the Gator Bowl. Dickey admitted to reporters that he had been offered the position at Florida, but Graves and UF president Stephen C. O'Connell continued to deny that personnel changes were imminent, with Graves stating that \\"there is utterly no truth to the rumor.\\"\\"Vol Fans Await Dickey's Return Like Posse Hunting Horse Thief\\" Middlesboro Daily News, October 21, 1970\\"Will the Real Coach Please Stand Up?\\" UPI, December 29, 1969\\"Florida bosses bobbled the ball on Dickey deal\\" Daytona Beach Morning Journal, January 4, 1970 Despite these denials, Dickey was introduced as the Gators' new head football coach five days after the Gator Bowl contest by Florida's new full-time AD, Ray Graves. Players on both the Florida and Tennessee squads were upset by the move and the NCAA conducted an investigation to determine whether ethics policies were violated.\\"'We Won for our Coaches'\\" St. Petersburg Times, December 28, 1969\\"Gators Wanted Ellenson as Head Coach\\" Palm Beach Post, January 1, 1970\\"Gator Probe is Confirmed\\", St. Petersburg Times June 10, 1970 However, no wrongdoing was discovered and Dickey was the Gator head coach for 1970.\\"Gators Victors Off the Field\\" St. Petersburg Times, October 2, 1970 The teams did not meet very often in the SEC schedule, but following Georgia Tech's departure, the regular season rotation coincidentally had them facing off in Knoxville the following October. UT fans, who denounced Dickey as a \\"traitor\\", eagerly anticipated the match-up and were not disappointed, as the Vols beat his new Florida squad 38–7 behind quarterback Bobby Scott's then-school record 385 passing yards. The Gators assisted the rout by committing four turnovers, including two John Reaves interceptions returned for touchdowns.\\"Dickey's Return a Tennessee Nightmare\\" Daytona Beach Morning Journal, October 24, 1970 Both Dickey and Graves remained in their respective positions at UF until the late 1970s, with Dickey fired after the 1978 season and Graves retiring in 1979. During his last season as Florida's coach, Dickey hired a recently retired Florida alum to his first coaching job as the Gators' quarterback coach: Steve Spurrier. In yet another twist, Dickey returned to Knoxville in 1985 to serve as UT's athletic director, replacing Bob Woodruff. Woodruff had played football at Tennessee, but he had been Dickey's head football coach at Florida and had also served as UF's athletic director immediately preceding Ray Graves.UT hires Dickey to be its Athletic Director Gainesville Sun, August 24, 1985 Dickey was the head of UT's athletic department during the intense UF/UT Spurrier/Fulmer rivalry of the 1990s and retired in 2002, after which he moved to Jacksonville, Florida.

In yet another link between the programs, Spurrier had been a star quarterback at Science Hill High School in Johnson City, Tennessee during the early 1960s. Although Knoxville is nearby, he did not seriously consider attending UT because he was an excellent passer and the Vols ran a single-wing offense at the time which featured a running quarterback.\\"The Spurrier Sweepstakes\\" The Lakeland Ledger, November 12, 1996 Instead, he choose to return to the state of his birth (Spurrier was born in Miami BeachSpurrier bio, St. Pete Times), eventually becoming the Gators' first Heisman Trophy winner in 1966. Tennessee and Florida did not face off during Spurrier's time as the Gators' quarterback. However, he did return to Knoxville in 1988 when he was the head coach at Duke, and his Blue Devils upset the Vols, 31–26. Emotions ran high when Spurrier brought his first Gator squad to Neyland Stadium in October 1990. Florida was 5–0 and ranked No. 9 coming into the matchup with Johnny Majors' 3–0–2 and No. 5 Vols, marking the first time in series history that both rivals were ranked in the AP top-10 when they faced off. The game began as a defensive struggle, with UT holding a slim 7–3 lead at the half. However, the Vols' Dale Carter returned the second half kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown, igniting the home crowd at Neyland Stadium.\\"Gators Seeking Special Play from Special Teams\\" The Gainesville Sun, October 11, 1991 The Gators fumbled on their next possession and would turn the ball over six times in the second half. The opportunistic Vols took full advantage, turning Spurrier's homecoming (and, coincidentally, Tennessee's homecoming game) into a 45–3 rout, the largest margin of victory in series history.\\"Tennessee Domination Was Total\\", The Gainesville Sun, October 14, 1990  1991: \\"Faxgate\\"  In the week before the 1991 game, media reports began circulating that former UT assistant coach Jack Sells, who had been fired before that season for his role in recruiting violations, had allegedly faxed UF defensive coordinator Ron Zook, himself a former Tennessee assistant, the Vols' offensive gameplan. At first, Zook denied receiving any information, but he soon clarified his statement and said that Sells had sent him a fax of \\"newspaper clippings\\" about the upcoming game. Florida won the contest 35–18 behind 245 yards and three touchdowns from Gator quarterback Shane Matthews and five Vol turnovers, but the \\"faxgate\\" controversy continued after the final whistle.\\"Florida Takes Control of SEC with 35–18 Upset of Tennessee\\" AP, October 12, 1991 A follow-up newspaper investigation in Knoxville located an employee of a local Kinko's copy center who said that he had noticed Sells faxing copies of a UT \\"playbook\\" and insisted that Sells stop the transmission after over a dozen pages had been sent. The employee had saved the fax cover sheet, which detailed a transmission sent three days before the UF–UT game by a \\"Jack Sells\\" to a \\"Ron Zook\\" at a Gainesville telephone number. Head coaches Johnny Majors and Steve Spurrier downplayed the incident, and although Tennessee athletic director (and former Gator quarterback and head football coach) Doug Dickey expressed concern about Sells' actions, Spurrier later said that he and Dickey spoke about the incident on the phone and \\"laughed about it\\". Right after the game, Spurrier pointed out that UT gained over 400 yards of offense (including 392 passing yards) in the game and joked that it certainly didn't seem like his defensive staff had any inside information. For his part, Fulmer later admitted that the UT staff had copies of the Gators' offensive playbooks at the time. An SEC investigation concluded without punishment. Jack Sells, the person at the center of the incident, left the coaching profession and successfully sued Kinko's for privacy violations, though he temporarily moved out of the state of Tennessee after being assaulted by an angry Vols fan in Chattanooga. After a stint as an assistant coach in the NFL, Zook succeeded Spurrier as the Gators' head coach in 2002. He was reluctant to talk about \\"Faxgate\\" during his tenure at UF (2002–04), though when asked, he admitted that Sells' infamous transmission had actually been a set of hand-drawn Volunteer offensive plays. However, Zook insisted that they \\"were so immaterial, and it made no difference and had no relevance, it was nothing.\\"  1995: Second half rain  For the third time in five seasons, the No. 8 Vols and No. 4 Gators were both undefeated and ranked in the top ten coming into their annual contest. The squads featured talented young quarterbacks in UT sophomore Peyton Manning and UF junior Danny Wuerffel, and many pregame prognosticators accurately predicted an offense shootout, with Sports Illustrated planning on putting Manning on the cover of their magazine the week after the game. The Vols struck quickly. On the first play from scrimmage, Manning connected with receiver Joey Kent for a 72-yard gain. On the next play, Manning threw a touchdown pass to Marcus Nash, giving UT a 7–0 lead only 15 seconds into the game.COLLEGE FOOTBALL; For Gators, It's the Last 30 Minutes That Count New York Times After another Manning touchdown pass and two Gator turnovers, the Vols held a 30–14 advantage late in the second quarter in front of a stunned Florida Field crowd. Wuerffel led the Gators to an answering score, cutting the lead to 30–21 with a touchdown pass in the last minute of the first half. That would be the beginning of a historic run, as Florida scored 48 straight points despite a torrential second half downpour and won in a 62–37 rout. Many records were broken in the game: Wuerffel threw an SEC record six touchdown passes; Tennessee set school records for most points scored in a loss and most points given up in the modern era. After the game, Sports Illustrated chose to put Wuerffel on its cover instead of Manning. Florida would go 12–0 through the regular season and the SEC Championship Game and played for the national championship in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, losing in a blowout to Nebraska. Tennessee would not lose another game all season, finishing 11–1 after a Citrus Bowl victory over Ohio State. The schools finished No. 2 and No. 3 in the final polls, with the AP Poll placing the Gators ahead and the Coaches' Poll reversing the order. The Coaches' Poll was another cause of controversy. Two coaches had voted the Gators out of their top ten, allowing the Vols to slip above them in the final rankings. Since the ballots were submitted secretly, the coaches in question were never identified, but some in the UF program suggested that UT's coach Fulmer had purposely skewed his ballot to improve his team's ranking at the expense of their rival. Fulmer insisted that he had not voted Florida out of his top ten, but did admit that he had ranked them behind his own team.\\"'Early Championship' Fueled by Bad Blood\\" Dwight Collins, Ocala Star-Banner. September 16, 1996  1996: First half rain  Once again, the late September matchup between Tennessee and Florida found both teams ranked in the top 5, with the Volunteers ranked No. 2 and the Gators No. 4 in the AP poll. The game was played in newly expanded Neyland Stadium, and an NCAA record crowd of over 107,000 were in attendance for one of the most highly anticipated games of the college football season. The tone for the game was set on the Florida's first possession, when the Gator drive stalled and they faced a 4th down and 10 from the UT 35 yard line. Not wanting to attempt a long field goal in the steady rain, and, spurning the punt team, coach Steve Spurrier decided to leave his offense on the field. On the ensuing play, quarterback Danny Wuerffel connected with Reidel Anthony on a post route over the middle for a touchdown that put the Gators up 7–0 and stunned the Volunteer crowd. Teako Brown intercepted Manning on the Vols' first drive, and it took Wuerffel only one play to find the end zone again, hitting Terry Jackson from 10 yards out to extend the lead to 14–0. UF doubled its lead in a 52-second stretch early in the 2nd quarter, as Ike Hilliard and Jacquez Green became the third and fourth different receivers with touchdown receptions on the afternoon, sandwiched around a James Bates interception of Manning. Anthone Lott's 27-yard fumble return stretched the lead to 35–0, before Manning finally got UT on the scoreboard before halftime on a 72-yard strike to Peerless Price. With the Gators switching to a more conservative game plan in the second half, Tennessee cut the lead to 35–22 with 8 minutes left with 2 more touchdown tosses, including a second to Price. Andy McCellough's 14-yard reception brought the Vols within 35–29 with 10 seconds left, but Florida recovered the ensuing onside kick to secure the six-point victory. Manning threw for 492 passing yards on 65 attempts (both school records) and four touchdowns on the day, but also tossed four interceptions. Florida went on to win its 4th straight SEC championship and first ever national championship.  1997: Spelling \\"Citrus\\"  During the mid-1990s, the second highest ranked SEC squad was usually invited to play in the Citrus Bowl after the season. Florida won four consecutive SEC titles from 1993 to 1996, beating Tennessee each time and twice sending them to the Citrus Bowl. Spurrier, who was often known to poke fun at rivals, made jokes at Tennessee's expense during off-season Gator Booster dinners in the spring of 1997, pointing out that \\"you can't spell Citrus without UT\\" and suggesting Peyton Manning had returned for his senior season at UT because \\"he wants to be a three-time Citrus Bowl MVP\\". Ironically, even after UF beat UT 33-20 in 1997 for their fifth straight victory in the series, upset losses to LSU and Georgia put the Gators in the Citrus Bowl. Meanwhile, Tennessee and Manning won their first SEC Championship Game and went on to play in the 1998 Orange Bowl.  1998: Fulmer breaks through  After Peyton Manning and several other star players moved on to the NFL after the 1997 season, most preseason prognosticators saw Tennessee's 1998 squad as taking a step backward from championship contention.\\"Tennessee wants to keep proving people wrong\\" Tom Sharp, Ocala Star-Banner, January 3, 1999 However, they were still ranked No. 6 when the No. 2 Gators rolled into Knoxville looking to beat their rivals for the sixth straight year. It was not to be. Led by junior quarterback Tee Martin and a stout defense, the Vols recovered four Gators fumbles, held their opponent to -30 yards rushing, and slowed UF's two-quarterback passing attack, which featured Doug Johnson and Jesse Palmer alternating plays. The game was close throughout, with the score knotted at 10 at halftime and 17 at the end of regulation. Tennessee was held to a Jeff Hall field goal during their first possession of overtime. When it was UF's turn, placekicker Collins Cooper missed an answering 32-yard field goal attempt, giving UT a 20–17 win and inspiring the jubilant home fans to rush the turf of Neyland Stadium and tear down the goalposts. It was not the first last-minute win for the Vols that season, and it would not be the last, either. UT survived several close calls to complete their first perfect season (12–0) since 1938 and claimed their first national championship since 1951 with a 23–16 victory over Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl  2000: The \\"Catch?\\"  In front of a record crowd in Neyland Stadium, the Vols were leading the 2000 UF/UT contest on the strength of stifling defense and 175 rushing yards from running back Travis Henry. However, an inability to finish drives led to a school record five field goals from kicker Alex Walls and a slim 23–20 lead. Down by that score late in the fourth quarter, UF took possession of the ball at their own 9-yard line. Gator quarterback Jesse Palmer steadily led his team down the field, and with 14 seconds left in the game, they found themselves with a first and goal at the Vols' 3. After a touchdown pass was called back because of an ineligible man downfield penalty, Palmer's next pass was to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney in the endzone. Gaffney held the ball for a brief moment before it was quickly slapped away by Volunteers cornerback Willie Miles. The official in the area signaled a touchdown, ruling that Gaffney had had possession of the ball long enough to be considered a catch. After a brief conference with the referee, the call was confirmed despite strident protests from the UT coaching staff and loud boos from the crowd. The extra point gave Florida a 27–23 victory. After the game, Volunteer fans were incensed by the call, as they believed Gaffney never gained possession of the ball and that the pass should have been ruled incomplete. Vanderbilt alumnus Al Matthews, the line judge official who made the initial call, received death threats after the game and was not assigned to officiate any games in Knoxville until after Fulmer left.  2001: Season finale  As usual, the Gators and Vols were slated to meet on the 3rd Saturday of September during the 2001 season. However, the SEC canceled all games on the weekend following the September 11 attacks, and they were rescheduled for December 1, 2001, requiring the SEC Championship Game to be pushed back a week as well. As the season progressed, the postponed game took on greater and greater importance. Each squad suffered only one close loss (#6 Tennessee lost to Georgia 26–24, #1 Florida lost to Auburn 23–20) and entered the contest with Tennessee ranked #5 and Florida ranked #2. The winner would represent the SEC East and face LSU in the SEC Championship. With a win in that game, the Gators or Vols were likely to receive an invitation to the Rose Bowl to face the undefeated Miami Hurricanes with a national title on the line. But in 2001, despite the teams' identical records and much to the chagrin of the Vols, the Gators were 17-and-a-half point favorites at kickoff.Portsmouth Daily Times – Google News Archive Search Gators starting running back Earnest Graham had been controversially injured in UF's win over rival Florida State the previous week and was unable to play.Lakeland Ledger – Google News Archive Search The star of the game would turn out to be the running back for the other squad, as UT's Travis Stephens rushed 19 times for 226 yards (the second highest total ever given up by a Florida defense) and two touchdowns to lead the Vols' attack. Without Graham, Florida managed only 36 total yards on the ground. Gator quarterback Rex Grossman threw 51 times for 362 yards and two touchdowns, but his pass on a potentially game-tying two-point conversion attempt with 1:10 left in the 4th quarter fell incomplete. The Vols held on for a 34–32 upset victory, ending a 30-year winless drought against Florida in Gainesville.Boca Raton News – Google News Archive Search Ultimately, neither team would win any championships that season. UT was upset by LSU in the SEC Championship Game the following Saturday and missed their opportunity to play for a second national title in four years. The Vols ended up beating Michigan 45–17 in the Citrus Bowl. Florida was invited to the Orange Bowl, where they beat Maryland 56–23. The teams' December meeting would become even more historical in early January, when Steve Spurrier announced that he was resigning as Florida's head coach after 12 seasons. The 2001 game was thus the last matchup in the Spurrier- Fulmer chapter of the rivalry (they would meet several additional occasions after Spurrier became South Carolina's head coach in 2005) and Spurrier's last home game at Florida Field.  2004: Unsportsmanlike conduct  Like the game in Knoxville four years previously, the 2004 UF/UT contest on Tennessee's home field also ended in controversy involving an official's call. Holding on to a 28–27 lead, Florida was attempting to run the clock out late in the fourth quarter. Florida gained one first down, then were stopped on the subsequent third down play and began to send in the punt team with under a minute left in the game and the clock running. After the play, however, Gator receiver Dallas Baker and Vols defensive back Jonathan Wade got into an altercation, with Wade head-slapping Baker and Baker responding with a head slap of his own. Referee Bobby Moreau appeared to have a clear view of the incident, but only Baker was called with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. The officials had stopped the clock with 55 seconds left in the game to call the penalty and move the Gators back 15 yards, but then incorrectly neglected to restart the clock before the ball was snapped for the punt. UT received the punt and quickly drove to the Florida 33-yard-line. With six seconds left, placekicker James Wilhoit, who had missed wide right a game-tying extra point earlier in the quarter, earned redemption by hitting a 50-yard field goal, giving his team a 30–28 victory. The Gator squad and fans were incensed by both the penalty and the subsequent failure to restart the game clock, feeling that the combination of calls had given the Vols an undeserved chance to win the game. Bobby Moreau, the official who called the penalty on Baker, received death threats after the game. SEC director of officials Bobby Gaston subsequently removed Moreau from working games in Gainesville.  2009: Kiffin versus Meyer  Lane Kiffin replaced Phil Fulmer as Tennessee's new head coach before the 2009 season. At his introductory press conference, Kiffin boldly predicted that he would \\"sing Rocky Top all night\\" in Gainesville after his team beat Florida the following September. Soon after, he incorrectly accused Florida coach Urban Meyer of breaking recruiting rules over a player that ended up going to Tennessee, sparking a series of public jibes between the coaches that continued all through the off-season and helped to make the 2009 meeting the most anticipated game in the series in several years despite the fact that Gators were ranked No. 1 and the Volunteers were unranked. The game was a relatively uneventful 23–13 Florida win, but the coaches' verbal sparring continued in the post-game press conferences. Meyer suggested that Kiffin had not played to win but had simply tried to \\"keep it close\\" and mentioned that the Gators' sluggish play on the afternoon was partly due to the fact that several players, including their star quarterback Tim Tebow, had the flu. From the visiting locker room, Kiffin sarcastically responded that \\"after we're not excited about our performance, we'll tell you that everybody was sick.\\" Eventually, SEC commissioner Michael Slive publicly warned the coaches to end their war of words, and later sent an official letter of reprimand to Kiffin when he continued to criticize opposing coaches and SEC officials. In January 2010, Kiffin resigned to become the head coach at Southern California, abruptly ending his feud with Meyer after only one season.  2014 – 2017: Comebacks every year While the rivalry faded in national importance in the mid-2010s, the contests themselves were quite memorable, as four UF-UT games in a row featured a dramatic fourth quarter rally. *2014: For the first time since 1955, both Florida and Tennessee were unranked coming into their matchup. The game was a defensive battle, and Tennessee led 9–0 at halftime on a trio of field goals by kicker Aaron Medley. With starter Jeff Driskel struggling, Florida turned to freshman backup quarterback Treon Harris midway through the third quarter, and the Gator offense was able to ground out a fourth quarter touchdown after a Tennessee fumble deep in their own territory. Late in the fourth quarter, Florida Kicker Austin Hardin booted a 49-yard field goal – his first successful attempt of the season – to give the Gators their first lead at 10–9. Tennessee had one more chance to respond and drove into Florida territory, but an interception by defensive back Keanu Neal with 51 seconds remaining preserved the Gators' slim road victory. *2015: Both teams were again unranked coming into the game, but both programs had hope for the future due to first year head coaches – Jim McElwain at Florida and Butch Jones at Tennessee – and the contest was the most hyped-up game in the rivalry in several years. The Vols led 17–7 at halftime and 27–14 with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter as Florida's offense struggled for much of the game. In the middle of the fourth quarter, freshman quarterback Will Grier led the Gators on a 17-play, 86-yard drive that included two fourth down conversions and ended with a touchdown. The Vols could not run out the clock, and Florida got the ball back with two minutes left down 27–21. On fourth down and 14 yards to go from their own 37-yard line, Grier completed a pass to Antonio Callaway near the first down marker. Callaway wheeled away from a defender and ran untouched down the sideline for a 63-yard touchdown that gave the Gators a 28–27 lead with 1:26 to play. :Tennessee mounted a last-minute drive, and with three seconds left, kicker Aaron Medley lined up to attempt a 55-yard field goal. The kick was badly off target, but the play did not count, as Florida had called timeout right before the snap because they had 12 men on the field. Medley's second attempt sailed just wide, and Florida held on for their 11th straight win in the series. *2016: Both Tennessee (#14) and Florida (#19) were back in the top 20 for their 2016 meeting. However, Tennessee was the \\"overwhelming\\" favorite to win the SEC Eastern Division for the first time since 2007 and were a touchdown favorite coming into the rivalry game, especially with Gators' starting quarterback Luke Del Rio injured and unable to play. Still, Florida owned a long winning streak over their rivals, and prior to the game, Florida cornerback Quincy Wilson confidently predicted that it would continue. \\"Nobody has ever seen a duck pull a truck\\", he said to reporters. \\"Florida Gators are going to win, simple as that.\\" :Behind backup quarterback Austin Appleby, Florida jumped out to a 21–0 lead by midway through the second quarter and led 21–3 at the half. In the second half, however, the Volunteer offense came to life behind quarterback Josh Dobbs, who accounted for five touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) against a Florida defense which had only given up one touchdown in their first three and a half games combined. Tennessee’s 38 consecutive points (35 in the second half) brought them a 38–28 victory, breaking the Gators' long series win streak. \\"That duck is pulling that truck, baby!\\" commented Tennessee coach Butch Jones in the postgame news conference. :However, Florida would get the last laugh. The Vols would go on to beat Georgia on a Hail Mary the following week and achieve a #9 ranking in the AP Poll, but then they would lose 3 consecutive SEC games. This cost them the lead in the SEC East, and Florida would go to the SEC Championship game for the 2nd straight year. *2017: The Gators (#24) and Volunteers (#23) entered their 2017 contest on the edge of the AP rankings, but both Florida's Coach McElwain and Tennessee's Coach Jones were feeling pressure to improve in their third year at their respective programs. :Both teams struggled to score for three quarters, and Florida held a 6–3 lead heading into the final period. The action picked up considerably early in the fourth quarter, beginning when Florida returned an interception for a touchdown. The Vols responded with a long drive that ended with their first touchdown, and the Gators responded with their first offensive touchdown to take a 20–10 lead. Tennessee rallied for another touchdown and kicked a short field goal with under a minute remaining to tie the score at 20, seemingly sending the contest into overtime. On the ensuing possession, Florida had a first down at their own 37 yard line with nine seconds remaining. Freshman quarterback Feleipe Franks rolled to his right and tossed a long Hail Mary pass down the length of the field that wide receiver Tyrie Cleveland caught in the middle of the Tennessee end zone as time expired, giving the Gators a 26–20 win on a play that was dubbed the “Heave to Cleve”. :After the dramatic win, the Gators had few additional opportunities to celebrate in 2017 as they finished 4–7. The Volunteers finished 4–8 and went winless in conference play for the first time in program history. Neither Florida's McElwain nor Tennessee's Jones were still employed by their respective schools at the end of the season, as both head coaches had each been fired in November. == See also == * List of NCAA college football rivalry games == References  Bibliography == * 2009 Southern Conference Football Media Guide, Year-by-Year Standings, Southern Conference, Spartanburg, South Carolina, pp. 74–77 (2009). * 2010 Southeastern Conference Football Media Guide, Florida Year-by-year records, Southeastern Conference, Birmingham, Alabama, p. 60 (2010). * 2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide, University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 116–125 (2011). * Carlson, Norm, University of Florida Football Vault: The History of the Florida Gators, Whitman Publishing, LLC, Atlanta, Georgia (2007). . * Golenbock, Peter, Go Gators!

It is endemic to northeastern Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. It was for a long time only known from the type series collected in 1960 (the precise location of which was unknown), until another population was discovered in 2004. This was followed by the rediscovery of population at the type locality as well as few other populations, all in Rio Grande do Sul. Its common name is Torres redbelly toad, after the type locality. ==Description== Melanophryniscus macrogranulosus grow to at least snout–vent length. Individuals larger than about SVL are considered adults. Colouration changes through development. Dorsum in newly metamorphosed juveniles is dark gray. The ventral surface is pale, partially translucent. Palmar and plantar surfaces are also pale. Later on, palmar and plantar surfaces and the posterior region of venter show a pallid orange colour that gets more intense over time. Larger juveniles have also dark green dorsal surface of body and limbs, dark blue ventral surface with white spots, and some orange-red patches on the axils and belly. Colouration is variable in adults. The dorsal colour varies from light to dark green to almost black. Ventral surface exhibits a green or grayish blue pattern with red patches; one patch is always present on abdominal region and axils, and often in gular and pectoral region. There are small white spots covering all ventral surface, including limbs, throat, pectoral and abdominal regions. Palmar and plantar surfaces have red orange colouration. Colouration is suspected to be aposematic. These toads show the unkenreflex when disturbed. ==Reproduction== Melanophryniscus macrogranulosus is an explosive breeder, breeding after heavy rains in temporary streams. Males call in shallow water along the streams both day and night, sometimes hidden in small cavities in the ground. Amplexus takes place in water. ==Habitat and conservation== Melanophryniscus macrogranulosus is only known from the Atlantic Forest biome. All known populations occur close to forest remnants. Breeding takes place in temporary streams. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the species as \\"Vulnerable\\". Caorsi and her colleagues suggest that it should be classified as \\"Endangered\\" because of its small range, fragmented habitat, and disturbance from human activities. It is not known to occur within any protected area. ==References== Category:Melanophryniscus Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians described in 1973 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Melanophryniscus macrogranulosus"},{"id":"12359460","text":"Melanophryniscus montevidensis is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

The university was named after the ruler Vikramaditya. It was established in 1957. It was evaluated by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council and was awarded an A grade. ==History== Vikram University was established in Ujjain on 1 March 1957. Shri Ranchod Lalji Dhabai donated the land for it from Barnagar. The foundation stone of Vikram University was laid by the then Home Minister of India Shri Govind Vallabh Pant on 23 October 1956. The function was presided over by the Rajpramukh of Madhya Bharat State Late Jiwajirao Scindia. The state of Madhya Pradesh was formed in 1956, and Madhya Bharat was merged into it. The Act relating to the University was accordingly amended. The amended Act of Vikram University No. 13, 1957 was published in Madhya Pradesh Gazette on 16 August 1957. The University's jurisdiction diminished due to the 1964-65 formation of Indore University, Gwalior and Bhopal University during 1969-70. On 20 April 1973, the Governor granted permission to bring about homogeneity in the organization and administration of Madhya Pradesh Universities. This permission was first published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette (extraordinary) on 23 April 1973. By a notification of the Education Department 940/20/8/71 dated 3 May 1973, the by-laws of the Madhya Pradesh Universities Act No. 1 to 19 were brought into effect from 25 September 1973, No. 20 to 26 from 1 December 1973, and No. 27 to 31 from 4 May 1974, for all the Universities of Madhya Pradesh (including Vikram University). The Madhya Pradesh Universities Act was amended and published in Madhya Pradesh Gazette on 28 June 1985. As per the amendment, University Jurisdiction was redefined and demarcated in accordance with the Revenue districts of Ujjain Division, including Ujjain, Ratlam, Mandsaur, Neemuch, Shajapur and Dewas. Because of the new jurisdiction, the number of affiliated colleges decreased, and some new colleges were granted affiliation. == Satellite campus== The University Schools and Administrative blocks are connected to the satellite. Over 500 online research journals/magazines are available. MoU's with international universities facilitate a global perspective. Vikram Vatika zoo is situated on campus. ==Research and extensions== The University has undertaken research and extension work incorporating various knowledge streams. The projects are funded by University Grants Commission (UGC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), All India Council for Technical Education(AICTE), and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). == Disciplines == School of Engineering and Technology The university's department of engineering is an AICTE approved, self-financed government institute. The Kaushal Vikas Kendra skill development initiative trains students of different streams in technical trades.

It is endemic to Tanzania. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, subtropical or tropical low- altitude grassland and swamps. A single specimen was collected in 2002 and it was first described in 2004. ==Description== This toad is known only from a single specimen which was in snout to vent length. It is a robust toad with paratoid glands twice as long as they are wide and no tympani, a fact which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar Nectophrynoides viviparus. The back is a dappled grey colour, smooth and covered with small warts. A dark line runs along the spine. The belly is whitish with a central dark line which continues along the inside of the limbs. There are large glands on the limbs and there is some webbing on the hind feet but none on the fore feet. The tips of the digits are noticeably enlarged. ==Distribution== The single specimen of Nectophrynoides laevis was found in the Uluguru Mountains in eastern Tanzania. This area is tropical, forest-clad and mountainous but the exact habitat in which it was found is unknown but is likely to be at an altitude of at least above sea level. ==Life cycle== As this species is known from a single male specimen, its life cycle is unknown. However, other members of its genus are ovoviviparous, with small toads developing from eggs retained inside the female's body, and it is probable that it also produces live young in this way. ==Status== As this species has only recently been described, its conservation status is unclear and it is listed as \\"Data Deficient\\" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Uluguru South Forest Reserve where it is found is a remote area in the Uluguru Mountains where it would appear to face few threats. ==References== laevis Category:Amphibians described in 2004 Category:Endemic fauna of Tanzania Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Nectophrynoides laevis"},{"id":"12359538","text":"Nectophrynoides minutus is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

It is endemic to Tanzania. This species was first described by Jean Roux in 1906 and was named in honour of the German zoologist Gustav Tornier. ==Description== Tornier's forest toad is sexually dimorphic and the colouring also varies considerably between individuals. The males are smaller at , with the dorsal surface brownish-red and the ventral surface grey or white. The females measure in length with the dorsal surface rust coloured with a central yellow region and a ventral surface that appears translucent. Females may also have two black bands across the lower legs and feet. The fingers on both sexes have expanded, flattened blunt pads. ==Distribution and habitat== Tornier's forest toad is endemic to the Eastern Arc Mountains in southern and eastern Tanzania. It is found in the forests and in agricultural areas adjoining forests at altitudes between above sea level. It is a terrestrial species and clambers about in low vegetation, forages on the ground and hides under leaf litter. ==Diet== Tornier's forest toad eats small invertebrates such as ants. ==Mating and reproduction== Breeding takes place in the rainy season. Males advertise themselves to attract females by calling at night from low vegetation. While doing this they adopt a characteristic pose with all four limbs extended. Unlike most frogs, this species is viviparous. Internal fertilisation takes place and the eggs, which are 3-4 mm in diameter, develop directly into juvenile frogs in the oviduct of the female. Up to thirty-five offspring have been found developing in one female. ==Status== Tornier's forest toad is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Although it occupies a total range that is smaller than it is common in much of this area and is not thought to be in significant decline. It is an adaptable species and when logging has affected its traditional habitat, has moved into agricultural areas and banana plantations. It is also threatened by illegal gold mining. ==References== tornieri Category:Amphibians described in 1906 Category:Endemic fauna of Tanzania Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Taxa named by Jean Roux Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Nectophrynoides tornieri"},{"id":"12359547","text":"Baldwin of Ibelin (died 21 February 1267) was the fourth of five sons of John I of Beirut and his second wife Melisende of Arsuf.

It is endemic to the West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. It is named in honour of Martin Vestergaard, the Danish biologist who was the first to recognize that the population now described as Nectophrynoides vestergaardi was a new species. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females in snout–urostyle length. The snout is short. The tympanum is distinct. The limbs are slender. The parotoid glands are present as a discrete raised elongated ridge. The fingers and toe tips are rounded. The fingers have traces of webbing while the toes have some basal webbing. Preserved specimens have light brown dorsal ground colour and are conspicuously darker laterally. Most individuals have a fine dark mid-dorsal vertebral line from snout to urostyle. The underside has a slightly translucent pale cream colour. The presence of a small number (18) of large, developed embryos in females suggests that this species is ovoviviparous. ==Habitat and conservation== Nectophrynoides vestergaardi occurs in montane forests and their ecotone toward ericaceous vegetation. It is a terrestrial species. It is locally relatively common but threatened by habitat loss caused by agricultural activities, wood extraction, and expanding human settlements. It occurs in a number of forest reserves, but these reserves require further protection. ==References== vestergaardi Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Tanzania Category:Endemic fauna of Tanzania Category:Amphibians described in 2004 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Nectophrynoides vestergaardi"},{"id":"12359551","text":"Nectophrynoides viviparus is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

The skin is smooth and has many small mucous glands. The paratoid glands are prominent just behind the eyes and nearby are circular tympani (eardrums). It also has large glands on its limbs which usually contrast in colour with the rest of the skin. The digits on the hands and feet are partially webbed. Some individuals are black with white markings, others are grey, green or dull red. In 2011, a new species of toad, Callulina meteora, was described from the mountains of Tanzania and has similarly large, contrastingly coloured glands on its limbs. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is known from the Uluguru Mountains and Udzungwa Mountains in eastern and southern Tanzania. It occurs in wooded areas, among bamboos and in grassland at the edges of forests at an altitude of between above sea level. ==Biology== Nectophrynoides viviparus is a terrestrial species and is ovoviviparous, which implies that it does not require a body of water in which to reproduce. Fertilisation is internal and the eggs develop through the larval stage inside the mother's oviduct, eventually emerging as fully formed juvenile toads. ==Status== It is found as several separate populations in an area of about .

It is endemic to northwestern Borneo and known from Sabah and Sarawak (Malaysia), although its distribution is likely to be broader and might extend to Kalimantan (Indonesia). It was first described from specimens collected from Mount Kinabalu. Palawan toadlet Pelophryne albotaeniata from Palawan, the Philippines, is morphologically similar to Pelophryne misera and might be its subspecies. ==Description== Pelophryne misera are small, stout toads. Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Colouration is dark brown, with blackish markings on the head, back, and flanks. The snout is blunt and has truncated vertical profile. The skin has warts. Hands and feet have fleshy webbing, reaching the tips of the first three fingers in the hands. Pelophryne misera are sexually dimorphic: males have a median subgular vocal sac, a row of yellow or brown spinules under the mandible, and a yellow or brown nuptial pad on the first finger. They also have minute spinules distributed over their whole dorsum. ==Reproduction== Males are calling from shrubs up to above the ground. Eggs are laid in small water-filled terrestrial depressions or water-filled leaf- cups of pitcher plants. Based on just one clutch, there are about 10 eggs measuring in diameter; low fecundity is typical for the genus. Eggs hatch into tadpoles after 16 days and metamorphose after 44 days. Tadpoles are endotrophic (developing without external food sources). ==Habitat and conservation== Natural habitats of Pelophryne misera are montane elfin forests above asl. Adult toads are largely terrestrial and live in leaf-litter, rock crevices, and holes in the ground. Pelophryne misera is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging, although this mainly takes place at lower altitudes. Infrastructure development for tourism is also a potential threat.

M. Montgomery. It is the sequel to Pat of Silver Bush, and describes Patricia Gardiner's life in her twenties and early thirties, during which she remains unmarried and takes care of her beloved home, Silver Bush, on Prince Edward Island. Pat hates change as much as ever, and finds in Silver Bush a refuge where she is somewhat shielded from it, but changes happen nevertheless. In the course of eleven years, new servants, new neighbors and new lovers come and go. Pat's older brother, Sid, marries May Binnie. The Gardiners consider the Binnie family to be of a lower class, and Pat and May have had an ongoing feud with since childhood. May and Sid live with the family at Silver Bush, and life there is no longer as pleasant as before, but Pat clings to her love of home desperately. Pat often wonders whether anything in life, like marriage or children, could be worth leaving Silver Bush behind. She comes close to becoming engaged to Donald Holmes, and later does become engaged to David Kirk, a widower who lives at the Long House (Bets Wilcox's old home) with his sister Suzanne. David eventually breaks the engagement and states (to Pat's protestations) that Hilary Gordon, who has been away studying architecture, is the reason he will never have Pat's affections. When their much-loved live-in housekeeper Judy Plum dies, Pat feels more alone than ever at Silver Bush. When Silver Bush ultimately burns down, Pat must resign herself to living elsewhere. One night, as Pat is looking over the burned remains of Silver Bush, Hilary finally returns to the Island to claim Pat with a kiss. The book's United States copyright was renewed in 1963. == Characters == Patricia (Pat) Gardiner: The heroine of the novel. Loyal and loving, and overly sensitive to any perceived slight to her home. She believes nothing can ever take her away from Silver Bush and that love is something she is not suited for. Sid Gardiner: Pat's older brother, who marries Pat's hated childhood acquaintance May Binnie, to the consternation of his family. Rachel Gardiner (called \\"Cuddles\\" and later \\"Rae\\"): Pat's youngest sister, who attends Queen's Academy to get a teacher's license, and continues to share Pat's room at Silver Bush until her marriage to Brook Hamilton. She and Pat are very close. May Binnie: A local girl who Pat has never liked, but who marries Sid and moves into Silver Bush. Long Alec Gardiner: The father of all the Gardiner children. Mrs. Gardiner: The mother of all the Gardiner children. Her health steadily improves after an operation at the conclusion of the previous novel. Judy Plum: The family's aging, live- in housekeeper who has been at Silver Bush for years. Josiah Tillytuck: The family's new hired man, who fits right in at Silver Bush. He plays the fiddle and tells outrageous stories, much to the consternation of Judy Plum, though she holds him in enough affection to make him his favorite treats. David Kirk: A widower, older than Pat, who buys the Long House (the former home of Pat's deceased best friend, Bets Wilcox) and comes to live there with his sister Suzanne. He and Pat become close friends and she enjoys his company and conversation, to the point that they become engaged, but he ultimately breaks the engagement. Suzanne Kirk: She comes to live at the Long House to keep house for her brother David. She and Pat eventually become close friends. Hilary \\"Jingle\\" Gordon: Pat's childhood friend, who for the majority of the novel is studying architecture at college and overseas. He loves Pat but Pat insists she feels he is like a brother to her. At the end of the novel, Pat realizes her feelings for him and they become engaged. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Plot introduction and book covers * An L.M.

Its natural habitats are dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, pastureland, urban areas, water storage areas, ponds, canals and ditches, and man-made karsts. ==Description== The African red toad is a fairly large species with adults reaching about in snout-to-vent length, females being slightly larger than males. The upper surface is reddish-brown with a pair of dark brown spots on the shoulders and another pair on the lower back. There is a dorso-lateral ridge with glands running from the tympanum to the back leg, and the outer part of this ridge is darker on its lower edge. The flanks in some individuals are dark and in others pale. ==Distribution and habitat== The African red toad is native to the southern half of Africa, ranging from Tanzania and southern Kenya through the southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo and eastern Angola southwards to South Africa. It is present in several different habitat types including grassland, wooded savannah and agricultural land and breeds in deep lakes, ponds and pools. ==Biology== Male African red toads call from the surface of deep still water in mid-summer. Double strings of eggs are laid in the water and may be tangled in submerged vegetation. The tadpoles are gregarious and may form dense swarms. The time between egg-laying and metamorphosis of the tadpoles into juveniles is 37 to 52 days. ==References== Category:Bufonidae Category:Amphibians of Sub-Saharan Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1848 Category:Monotypic amphibian genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"African red toad"},{"id":"12359729","text":"Osgood's Ethiopian toad (Altiphrynoides osgoodi formerly known as Spinophrynoides osgoodi) is a possibly extinct species of toad in the family Bufonidae endemic to the mountains of south-central Ethiopia. It was named for the American biologist Wilfred Hudson Osgood who carried out fieldwork in Ethiopia for the Field Museum in 1926–27. He collected the original specimens of Osgood's Ethiopian toad and three other endemic species of anuran. ==Distribution== The toad was common in the Bale Mountains National Park and other montane environments east of the Great Rift Valley, and was also said to be present in an isolated population in the Gughe Mountains, although the existence of this population was based on a single specimen which may have been misidentified. If the putative population in the Gughe mountains is not included then this toad's total range covered an area of . ==Habitat and ecology== Osgood's Ethiopian toad is mainly a species of tropical montane forest, possibly extending marginally into open moorland. There is an observation of these toads breeding in a small pool, which was probably temporary, within a grassy glade surrounded by Hypericum woodland during April. Long strings of eggs were laid from which the tadpoles hatched. ==Conservation== The toad is rare; the last specimen was observed 2003, despite extensive survey work in 2009. If it is still extant, it probably numbers no more than 50 individuals. It is threatened by habitat loss by subsistence exploitation of the forests. Chytrid fungus is very prevalent in amphibians in highland Ethiopia although there is no data on its impact on this species. ==References== osgoodi Category:Amphibians of Ethiopia Category:Endemic fauna of Ethiopia Category:Bale Mountains Category:Ethiopian Highlands Category:Critically endangered fauna of Africa Category:Amphibians described in 1932 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Osgood's Ethiopian toad"},{"id":"12359735","text":"Marcos Gomes de Araujo, better known as Marquinhos (born 23 March 1976), is a former Brazilian footballer.

The head length is equal to its width, with a pointed snout projecting beyond its mouth and the skin is covered in smooth warts. It lacks a tympanum and the paratoid glands are large and reach the base of the arm on the sides. It has short fingers and short toes which are one-third webbed, the webs are covered with granules. The back and sides of the head are either blackish or light colored with blackish cross-bars and the underside is yellow and spotted with black. ==Distribution== The Chrinda toad occurs in the Chirinda Forest in eastern Zimbabwe and in the Dombé Forest in adjacent Mozambique. There is also a recent record from Quirimbas National Park in northeastern Mozambique that may either suggest that the species is more widespread than previously assumed, or represent a disjunct population, possible of a different species. ==Habitat== The natural habitats of the Chrinda toad are lowland and montane evergreen forests where it lives in leaf- litter or hides in or under rotten logs. ==Habits== The adult Chirinda toads tend to hide within the leaf litter on the forest floor. The eggs are laid in small pools of water between the buttress roots of Chrysophyllum gorungosanum trees, or in the water filled grooves in the bark of fallen trees. ==Conservation== It is threatened by habitat loss caused by agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, and expanding human settlements. It occurs in one protected areas; the Ngungunyana State Forest in Zimbabwe, which is within the Chirinda Forest, and possibly also in the Quirimbas National Park in Mozambique. The restricted habitat of this species is still being degraded despite any apparent protection and the species is assessed as endangered. ==References== anotis Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of Mozambique Category:Amphibians of Zimbabwe Category:Amphibians described in 1907 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ","title":"Chirinda toad"},{"id":"12359742","text":"Mertensophryne howelli (common name: Mrora forest toad) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae.

WFGM is owned by West Virginia Radio Corporation and operated under their AJG Corporation licensee. ==History== Pre-broadcast Martinsburg, West Virginia, businessman C. Leslie Golliday filed the initial application for the station with the FCC on September 1, 1954. In the application, Golliday estimated construction costs at $13,608, with a first year operation cost of $36,000. Golliday estimated an initial revenue of $60,000. As WCLG, the station began testing equipment during the week of December 19, 1954, and filed its construction permit application two days later. WCLG broadcast for the first time on December 27, 1954. The station initially had a \\"music-news\\" format, using the Associated Press news service. In its early days, WCLG was a daytime-only broadcaster, with a power of 500 watts. Owner C. Leslie Golliday used his initials for the station's call sign. Golliday, who also owned Martinsburg's WEPM, envisioned a network of stations across the state of West Virginia. WCLG was officially granted its broadcast license by the FCC on January 18, 1955. Throughout its existence, the station's studios have been at 343 High Street in Morgantown. History since launch The WCLG studios and sign along High Street in Morgantown, 2015. On March 10, 1955, WCLG filed an application to increase its power to 1,000 watts, proposing to continue daytime-only broadcasts. The application was granted on September 28, 1955. In 1958, future owner Garry L. Bowers joined the station as an announcer. WCLG was bought by Freed Broadcasting Corporation for $67,000 on December 19, 1959. In May 1960, Stanley R. Cox, a candidate in the Republican primary election for the House of Representatives, filed an equal-time rule complaint against WCLG. Cox objected that the station gave his opponent, Sheriff Charles Whiston, a five-minute-long segment called \\"Sheriff's Office Calling\\". In the show, \\"arrests and other activities of interest are recited\\"; it ended with a 30-second \\"thought for the day\\". Cox had been refused equal-time by the station \\"on the ground that the program is a public service feature.\\" The FCC upheld the complaint, deciding the content of the program was \\"determined by Sheriff Whiston and not by the station\\" and that remarks made by the sheriff were of an editorial nature. Whiston would go on to win the primary over Cox by about 300 votes. The station's coverage of the explosion at the Farmington Number 9 mine, which killed 78, earned the station the Associated Press Radio-Television Association (APRTA) in early 1969. The station earned another APRTA award for \\"Outstanding News Coverage\\" the following year. Sister station WCLG-FM began broadcasting on September 28, 1974. Also during 1974, WCLG began a Top 40 format. Another change in format took place in 1978, with middle of the road (MOR) music taking the place of Top 40. WCLG became part of the NBC Radio Network on October 2, 1978. In 1979, Bowers became the station's general manager. WCLG applied for another broadcasting power increase on November 4, 1980, to 2,500 watts, but remained a daytime-only station. The station added oldies to its MOR music format in 1983. Logo used by WCLG under the branding \\"Oldies 13AM\\". In 1985, WCLG switched formats to a soft adult contemporary playlist. On March 15 of that year, Freed Broadcasting Corporation sold WCLG-FM and sister station WCLG to Bowers Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Garry Bowers, for $715,000. The station changed formats again in 1988, this time to classic hits. Two years later, WCLG began broadcasting during the nighttime with 44 watts of power, enough to cover the city of Morgantown. Another format change took place in 1991, when the station switched to golden oldies using the \\"Pure Gold\\" format from Satellite Music Network (now Cumulus Media Networks). Bowers Broadcasting Corporation owner Garry L. Bowers died on December 24, 2011. On September 25, 2013, control of the company was transferred to Bowers' widow, Linda K. Bowers. Sale Antenna on Jackson Street in WestoverOn September 26, 2013, Linda Bowers entered into an agreement to sell WCLG and sister station WCLG-FM to AJG Corporation, for $1.8 million. Bowers also entered into a time brokerage agreement, allowing AJG to operate the station prior to the close of the sale. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rescinded the transfer- of-ownership application on October 21, 2013, after an objection by Joe Potter, Senior Vice President of IMG Sports. Potter contended there were \\"very close connections and operational control\\" between AJG Corporation and West Virginia Radio Corporation (WVRC) and AJG's purchase of WCLG-AM/FM would \\"possibly in violation of FCC regulations.\\" The co-directors of West Virginia Radio Corporation, John and David Raese, operate AJG Corporation as a trust for their descendants. Potter's complaint went on to say that \\"IMG was close to finalizing a contract to air WVU sports\\" but was \\"prevented by the terms of AJG's purchase agreement\\", which barred Bowers Broadcasting Corporation from \\"'entering into any contract or agreement' without the consent of AJG\\". West Virginia Radio Corporation previously held the rights to West Virginia University sports before losing them to IMG Sports. West Virginia Radio Corporation filed a lawsuit against West Virginia University and IMG Sports to retain the broadcast rights, which it lost in late August 2013. The FCC granted the ownership transfer on February 3, 2015 subject to several conditions regarding business relationships and communication between AJG and WVRC. An appeal of the grant conditions was denied by the FCC on September 16, 2015. Bowers Broadcasting subsequently filed applications for extension of the consummation of the transfer on October 23, 2015, January 29, 2016, April 22, 2016, July 22, 2016, and October 17, 2016. The last of these extension requests was denied by the FCC on November 30, 2016, and this denial was appealed on January 10, 2017. The transfer to AJG Corporation was eventually consummated on September 1, 2017, at which point WCLG changed their format from classic hits to adult contemporary, branded as \\"Morgan 92.1\\". (info taken from stationintel.com) On November 29, 2019, the station changed its call sign to WFGM.

This compares with tetrastarch at 40% and hetastarch at 70% hydroxyethylation, respectively. It is sold under the name Pentaspan and used for fluid resuscitation. It is considered a plasma expander because it remains primarily intravascular after infusion. ==Choice of resuscitation fluid== The choice of fluid (normal saline vs. Ringer's lactate vs. pentaspan) is controversial. Physiologically, fluid with pentaspan stays primarily in the intravascular space: blood plasma. This is different than normal saline, which shifts quickly into the rest of the extracellular compartment. Advocates of pentaspan use believe that: # the primary deficit in fluid resuscitation is intravascular volume loss and # use of normal saline may lead to pulmonary edema, particularly in older patients. ==Normal saline versus pentastarch== Casualty Pentastarch in the emergency setting is not well studied and its use not of proven benefit.

They are found primarily in Afghanistan and Pakistan and form the world's largest tribal society, comprising over 49 million people and between 350 and 400 tribes and clans. They are traditionally divided into four tribal confederacies: the Sarbani (), the Bettani (), the Gharghashti () and the Karlani (). Folkloric genealogies trace the descendants of the Pashtuns to Qais Abdur Rashid and his three sons Saṛban (), Bēṭ (), and Gharghax̌t () as well as an adopted son, not directly adopted by Qais Abdul Rashid, therefore, the identity of Karlan himself and the man who adopted him, according to some books written on the history of the Pashtuns, is either unclear or controversial, the Karlani confederacy Ormur Baraki, who became the progenitor of the Karlani. There are several levels of organisation of Pashtun tribes. The \\"tribe\\" is subdivided into kinship groups, each of which is a khel and zai. A khel or zai is further divided into plarina, each of which consists of several extended families.Wardak, A. (2003) \\"Jirga – A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution in Afghanistan\\" p. 7, online at UNPAN (the United Nations Online Network in Public Administration and Finance), accessed 10 January 2009 A large tribe often has dozens of subtribes whose members may see themselves as belonging to each, some or all of the sub-tribes in their family tree depending upon the social situation: co-operative, competitive or confrontational.Wardak, A. (2003) \\"Jirga – A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution in Afghanistan\\" p. 10, online at UNPAN (the United Nations Online Network in Public Administration and Finance), accessed 10 January 2009 ==Etymologies== Tarbur refers to a \\"tribe\\" split into two or more clans. Tarbur means \\"cousin\\" in Pashto, so tarbur could be an enemy as well in the Pashtun culture that they can occupy your land or property. Every Pashtun tribe is then divide into subtribes, also called khel or zai. Zai in Pashto means \\"descendant\\". In Avestan it is similar to Pashto \\"Zoi\\" meaning son or offspring. William Crooke has said that khel is from an Arabic word meaning \\"association\\" or \\"company\\".Crooke, William (1896) The Tribes and Castes of the North-western Provinces and Oudh Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta, p. 158, A khel is often based in a single village,Wardak, A. (2003) \\"Jirga – A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution in Afghanistan\\" p. 6, online at UNPAN (the United Nations Online Network in Public Administration and Finance), accessed 10 January 2009 but it may also be based on a larger area including several villages, or part of a town.Albrecht, Hans-Jörg (2006) Conflicts and Conflict Resolution in Middle Eastern Societies: Between Tradition and Modernity Duncker & Humblot, Berlin, p. 358, Plarina is related to the Bactrian term plār, which derives from Old Iranian piðar (in Bactrian and Pashto, Old Iranian /ð/ usually yields /l/), and is related to Sanskrit pitar and English \\"father\\". The plural form of plār is plārina. A plārina is considered only when the 7th generation is born, meaning the father of multiple families (kahol). Usually, the 7th forefather is assumed to take from one-and-a-half century to two centuries. Kul (plural kahol) is the smallest unit in Pashtun tribal system, named after an ancestor of 1. Zāmon (\\"children\\"), 2. Lmasay / Nwasay (\\"grandchildren\\"), 3. Kaṛwasay (\\"great-grandchildren\\"), and 4. Kaoday (\\"great-great-grandchildren\\"). Once the fourth generation is born, it would be labelled a \\"family\\" or kūl. ==Dialects== The Bettani speak various Pashto dialects. The Ghilji or (Gharzai) of the central region around Paktika speak Central Pashto, a dialect with unique phonetic features, transitional between the southern and the northern dialects of Pashto. The Lohani (Rohani, Nohani) Marwat, as well as some other minor Lodi tribes and the Bettani proper, speak the Marwat Lodi Bettani dialect, which is a southern Pashto variety, however, its phonetics are different from the southern Kandahari Pashto. The Sheerani tribe of the Bettani confederacy speaks another southern dialect. The northern Bettani clans speak the northern or \\"hard\\" Pashto variety. Some of the Bettani lineages, including some (but not all) clans of the Niazi, have abandoned Pashto. Today they speak other languages, like Urdu, Hindko, Saraiki, Punjabi, Dari. The Gharghashti Kakar Naghar Panni Mandokhel and Musakhel and other minor settled in the region around Quetta Zhob ans Loralai speak dialect, which is a \\"soft\\" Pashto dialect very similar to Kandahari Pashto. The Safi, some of the Jaduns, and some other minor northern Gharghashti tribes speak the northern or \\"hard\\" Pashto variety. The Jaduns, living on the Mahabun mountain slopes around Swabi speak Pashto, while those living in Hazara speak Pashto and Hindko. Some clans of the Safi tribe speak the Pashayi languages but are mostly bilingual in Pashto. The Karlani speak some of the most distinctive Pashto dialects which are lexically different from standard Pashto varieties, and phonetically very varied. Furthermore, the Karlani dialects have a tendency towards a change in the pronunciation of vowels. Depending on the particular dialect, the standard Pashto [a], [ā], [o], [u] may change into [ā], [â/å/o], [ȯ/ȫ/e], [i], respectively. In the Karlani dialects of Waziristan, Bannu, and Tani (southern Khost), which follow the vowel shift to the greatest extent, these four vowels normally change into [ā], [o], [e], [i], respectively. Much of the Ormur tribe settled in some villages of Waziristan and Logar, who give their name to Ormur the folkloric ancestor of the Karlani, speak the Ormuri language which is distinct from Pashto. However, in general the Ormur are bilingual in Pashto, particularly in the Karlani dialect of Wazirwola. The southwestern Sarbani tribes, most notably the Durrani, speak (Kandahari Pashto) a \\"soft\\" dialect of Pashto; while northwestern Sarbani tribes such as Gigyani tribe, Yousafzai Khalil and Mohmand tribes etc., most notably they speak (Peshawari Pashto) Pashto a \\"hard\\" dialect of Pashto. Both of them are considered upper class dialects. In addition, a small section of the Tarin clan of the Sarbani living east of Quetta speak the distinctive Wanetsi (Tareeno) dialect, which is considered by some modern scholars to be distinctive enough to be classified as its own language.Hallberg, Daniel G. 1992. Pashto, Waneci, Ormuri. Sociolinguistic Survey of Northern Pakistan, 4. LINK ==History== Hotak Empire at its peak (1722–1729). It was established by the Hotak-Ghilji clan of the Bettani confederacy, and mainly encompassed parts of present-day Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan Coronation of Ahmad Shah Durrani (Durr-e Durrānī; the \\"founder of Afghanistan\\"), following a loya jirga held at Kandahar in 1747. The modern Durrani tribe is named after him The origin of Pashtuns is unclear but historians have come across references to various ancient peoples called Pakthas (Pactyans) between the 2nd and the 1st millennium, who may be their early ancestors. Often characterised as a warrior and martial race, their history is mostly spread among various countries of South and Central Asia, centered on their traditional seat of power in medieval Afghanistan. One theory suggests that the modern Ghilji lineages descended from the medieval Khalaj or Khilji tribe. Some Bettani lineages, however, are said to have descended in part from the medieval Ghorid people.The Bettani are named after their folkloric leader or ancestor, Shaikh Bet Baba (claimed to be among the first Pashto-language poets), who lived in the Altamur range, located between the Logar and Zurmat valleys. He is reported to have been buried in Ghazni.Balland, Daniel. Encyclopaedia Iranica. BĒṬANĪ. Originally published on 15 December 1989. In the 15th century, the Bettani are known to have mainly inhabited the Logar, Zurmat, and Ghazni regions. Subsequently, many of their lineages settled to the northeast, spreading up to the Damaan Valley, Mianwali, and parts of the present-day Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, in the east, and parts of Kunduz Afghanistan in the north. In the 19th century, the traditional way of life of the Bettani combined small-scale irrigated agriculture with seasonal nomadism or seminomadism. They engaged in pastoral migrations, along the mountain slopes in summers, and inversely, towards the Indus plains in winters. From the 13th century, various Khilji dynasties and ruling entities took control in the Bengal and Delhi Sultanates of the Indian subcontinent. In the 15th century, the Lodi tribe founded the Lodi dynasty, the last dynasty to rule the Delhi Sultanate. In the 16th century, the Sur Empire with its capital at Delhi was founded by Sher Shah Suri, a member of the Sur clan of the Bettani confederacy. Between 1709 and 1738, the Hotak clan of the Ghilji tribe ruled the Hotak Empire based first in Kandahar, Afghanistan and later very briefly in Isfahan, Persia. In the 16th century, Taj Khan Karrani of the Karlani tribe founded the Karrani dynasty, the last dynasty to rule the Bengal Sultanate. Several Karlani clans served in the Mughal army. The Bhopal State, in the present-day Madhya Pradesh state of Central India, was founded in 1723 by Dost Mohammad Khan Mirazikhel. He was from the Orakzai clan of the Karlani tribe, and was a mercenary in the Mughal army. After his death in 1728, his descendants, the Nawabs of Bhopal, continued ruling the state until Hamidullah Khan, the last sovereign nawab of the dynasty, officially acceded the state to India in 1949. The origin of the Sarbani might be connected with the Hephthalites (Ebodalo),The Hephthalites: Archaeological and Historical Analysis, Aydogdu Kurbanov, Berlin, 2010, page 242. who had a large nomadic confederation in the 5th–6th centuries CE, as well as with the Scythians,A brief history of Afghanistan, Shaista Wahab, Barry Youngerman, Infobase Publishing, 2007, page 14. whose languages are also known to be in the Eastern Iranian group along with Pashto. These groups were settled where most of Pashtuns live today. Ahmad Shah Durrani of the Sadozai clan of the Abdali tribe (now known as \\"Durrani\\" after him) established the Durrani Empire in 1747 with its capital at Kandahar. Ahmad Shah adopted the title Durr-e Durrānī (\\"pearl of pearls\\" or \\"pearl of the age\\"), and the name of his tribe Abdali was changed to \\"Durrani\\" after him. Ahmad Shah is now regarded as the founder of the modern state of Afghanistan. He controlled areas from Khorasan in the west up to Kashmir and Delhi in the east, and from the Amu Darya in the north up to the Arabian Sea in the south. It was the second-greatest Muslim empire in the second half of the 18th century, surpassed in size only by the Ottoman Empire. In 1826, Dost Mohammad Khan, of the Barakzai clan of the Durrani tribe, founded the Barakzai dynasty centered at Kabul. The Barakzai dynasty ruled present-day Afghanistan until 1973 when Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last Barakzai king, was overthrown in a bloodless coup by his own cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan. The coup ended the Barakzai kingdom and established the Republic of Afghanistan (1973–1978). The current heir apparent and crown prince of the Barakzai kingdom (23 July 2007 – present) is Ahmad Shah Khan. During the Delhi Sultanate era, the Pashtun Lodi dynasty replaced the Turkic rulers in North India. Some ruled from the Bengal Sultanate. Majority Pashtuns fought the Safavids and Mughals before obtaining an independent state in the early 18th century, which began with a successful revolution by Mirwais Hotak followed by conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Barakzai dynasty played a vital role during the Great Game from the 19th century to the 20th century as they were caught between the imperialist designs of the British and Russian empires. Pashtuns are the largest dominion ethnic group in Afghanistan and ruled as the dominant ethno-linguistic group for over 300 years. ==Territories== Sarbani The Sarbani confederacy include the Durrani historically called Abdali including its politically influential Sadozai and Barakzai clans, Tarkalani, Shinwari, Barech Alakozai, Achakzai, Kasi, Gumoriani, Gigyani, Ghoryakhel, Muhammadzai (Hashtnagar), Yusufzai,Badozai and other minor tribes and Khels. Bettani The Bettani confederacy include the Bettani Proper (whose highest concentration is in the region around Jandola), the much larger Ghilji or (Ghalzoi), Lodi Lohani (Rohani & Nohani) and other minor tribes. Gharghashti The Gharghashti or ( Gharghakhti) tribe of The Kakar, Dawi settled mainly in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan and Kandahar, Zabul, Herat provinces of Afghanistan. The Jadun and Panni, settled mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan; and the Safi, whose highest concentration is in the Kohi Safi district of Parwan province and the Pech valley of Kunar province, but are also present in other parts of northeastern Afghanistan and in northwestern Pakistan. There are also other minor Gharghashti tribes. Karlani The Karlani confederacy primarily inhabit the eastern, northeastern, and central regions of Loya Paktia, and the southwestern region of Nangarhar in Afghanistan; as well as the southern and central regions of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan.

Davis High School, commonly referred to as Davis High School, is a public high school located in Modesto, California, United States. Established in 1964, the school serves students in grades 9-12. Davis High was recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2005. ==History== Davis High School was established in what was then a rural setting, and was meant to serve approximately 1800 students from predominantly agricultural based families of north Modesto and Salida. As Modesto and Salida have grown, so has Davis High School. Davis later served more than 2800 students. However, after the opening of Joseph Gregori High School in Modesto, CA, Davis High School's student population again dropped below 2000 as a large portion of the student body enrolled at Gregori for the start of the 2010-2011 school year. ==Campus== The campus consists of three locker rows, an activity court or quad area used mainly for lunch consumption and student body activities, and approximately 100 classrooms. The campus is bordered, on the North Side, by Rumble Road, and on the West side by Tully Road. The South side of the campus is bordered by the Davis football field, tracks, and soccer fields. To the East, adjacent to the campus, is Davis Park, a recreational area. There is also a picnic area that used to have awnings covering the benches. After Davis became a closed campus, students continued to frequent the park during school hours, subjecting them to consequences for being out of bounds per board policy. ==Curriculum== The school participates in the California Partnership Academies program, which provides school-within-a-school opportunities for students interested in pursuing careers in health sciences and public safety: The Health Careers Academy, exclusive to the Grace Davis campus, is a four-year \\"school-within-a-school\\" program filled with college preparatory classes. Avid it stands for Advancement Via Individual Determination this program helps students get into a four-year college after they graduate high school. The Davis High School Public Safety Academy is a three-year \\"school within a school\\" program, with a recommended freshman pre-academy year, which offers a college preparatory academic curriculum as well as vocational experiences for students interested in careers in criminal justice and public safety. This program provides a thematic approach for core courses in the field of public safety and career exploration. The sophomore year introduces the academy concepts in the English, science, world history, and Public Safety Tech I classes. In the junior and senior years, students will continue to explore careers in public safety through their government, English, advanced math, and science classes, in addition to taking a CERT/First Responder course. Upon completion of the CERT/First Responder course, students are eligible to be members of the on-campus emergency preparedness and response team. ==Extracurricular activities== Student groups and activities include A.C.T.S., Academic Decathlon, anime club, band, Black Student Union, California Scholarship Federation, chess club, conflict mediation, gamers' club, gay- straight alliance, dance, drama, French club, FBLA, FFA, Future Fashion Designers, FHA, international club, Latino Student Union/Hispanic Youth Leadership Council, mock trial, music, Reach and Teach Tutoring, racing club, recycling, Science Bowl, Science Olympiad, and VICA/Skills USA.

The vast majority of Eleocharis species grow in aquatic or mesic habitats from sea level to higher than 5,000 meters in elevation (in the tropical Andes).Govaerts, R. & Simpson, D.A. (2007). World Checklist of Cyperaceae. Sedges: 1-765. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The genus itself is relatively easy to recognize; all Eleocharis species have photosynthetic stems but no green leaves (the leaves have been reduced to sheaths surrounding the base of the stems). Many species are robust, rhizomatously-spreading plants of lowland tropical wetlands, while many others are small caespitose annual or perennial herbs growing near streams, and still others are intermediate. There are also a number of species that are obligate aquatic species, which usually have submerged, branching stems and often exhibit interesting photosynthetic adaptations, such as the ability to switch between C3 and C4 carbon fixation in response to different environmental stimuli. In all Eleocharis species, the flowers are borne on unbranched terminal spikelets at the apices of stems.Flora of North America, Vol. 23 Page 4, 6, 7, 29, 60, Eleocharis R. Brown, Prodr. 224. 1810.

Altervista Flora Italiana, genere Eleocharis includes photos plus distribution maps for Europe and sometimes for North AmericaBiota of North America Program, 2013 county distribution maps for US and Canadian species In spite of the diversity of the genus itself, taxonomic characters useful for delimiting species within it are few, and many species are very difficult to tell apart. Many currently recognized species with very wide geographic ranges are highly polymorphic. Some of these species probably contain multiple independently evolving lineages. Because of their difficult nature, it is suggested that many botanists avoid collecting these plants and so many species are under-represented in the botanical record. One of the best known species is the Chinese water chestnut, Eleocharis dulcis. These plants bear tubers on their rhizomes which may be peeled and eaten raw or boiled. In Australia, magpie geese rely almost exclusively on these tubers for sustenance for a significant portion of the year. ==Selected species== *Eleocharis acicularis (L.)

He is usually portrayed as a child, although in some interpretations, he is said to be a young man. ==Stories== Arguably, the Juan Tamad story most often told illustrates his utmost laziness to the point of stupidity that it becomes comedic. In it, Juan Tamad comes upon a guava tree bearing ripe fruit. Being too slothful to climb the tree and take the fruits, he instead decides to lie beneath the tree and let gravity do its work. There he remained, waiting for the fruit to fall into his gaping mouth. Other Juan Tamad stories include: * Juan Tamad and the Mud Crabs\\" : Juan Tamad is instructed by his mother to purchase mud crabs at the market. Being too lazy to carry them home, he sets them free in a ditch and tells them to go on home, as he would be along later. * \\"Juan Tamad and the Rice Cakes\\" : Juan Tamad's mother makes some rice cakes and instructs him to sell these at the market. Passing by a pond, he sees frogs swimming to and fro. Being too lazy to sell the cakes at the market, he instead throws them at the frogs, who eat the cakes. Upon reaching home, he tells his mother that all the cakes had been sold on credit; the buyers would pay for them the next week. * \\"Juan Tamad and the Flea-Killer\\" : Juan Tamad's mother instructs him to go to the village market and buy a rice pot. A flea infestation in the village soon has Juan Tamad jumping and scratching for all he's worth; he lets go of the pot and it breaks into pieces. Thinking quickly, he picks up the pieces, grinds them into fine powder and wraps the powder in banana leaves, which he markets as \\"flea-killer.\\" * \\"Juan Tamad takes a Bride\\" : Juan Tamad's mother tells him it is time he took a bride. He asks his mother what sort of woman should he look for. His mother replies \\"a woman of a few words.\\" Juan Tamad searches long and hard, but all the women he encounters seem to talk too much. Finally, he comes upon a house where an old woman and her daughter live. Upon seeing the girl, he proposes \\"Will you marry me?\\" The girl simply stares at him. He tells himself, \\"Ah, here is a woman of a few words,\\" and lifts her up and takes her back to his mother. His mother chastises him, for he had brought back a corpse. ==Books== A book published by an unknown author in 1919 in Manila entitled Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal (Tagalog for \\"The Life lived by Juan Tamad, son of Fabio and Sofia, in the Kingdom of Portugal\\") contains a poem consisting of 78 pages of four-line stanzas at seven stanzas per page. It tells of how Juan Tamad was born to a couple named Fabio and Sofia, and his adventures in Portugal. In 1957, Manuel E. Arguilla (author of How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife) and Lyd Arguilla wrote the book Philippine Tales and Fables which included the story of Juan Tamad with illustrations by Romeo V. Tabuena. In 1965, playwright and publisher Alberto Florentino took the Arguillas' re-telling of Juan Tamad and published it as Stories of Juan Tamad, part of a series of 3 booklets for young readers. Illustrated with woodcuts by the late J. Elizalde Navarro (post-humously declared National Artist for Visual Arts), the book is out-of-print and is now considered a collector's item. ==Films== Several Filipino films have treated Juan Tamad as a central or supporting character. * Si Juan Tamad , released in 1947 and directed by Manuel Conde. * Juan Tamad Goes to Congress, released in 1960 and directed by Manuel Conde. * Juan Tamad Junior released in 1980, features Niño Muhlach as Juan Tamad Jr. and Manuel Conde as Juan Tamad Sr. * Juan Tamad at Mister Shooli sa Mongolian Barbecue, released in 1991, features director Manuel Urbano, Jr.'s television character Mr. Shooli and Eric Quizon as Juan Tamad. * Juan Tamad, released in 1993, again bills Eric Quizon as Juan Tamad. ==Television== * GMA 7 had also launched their newest comedy serie, Juan Tamad with StarStruck Alumni Sef Cadayona, Max Collins, RJ Padilla, Stephanie Sol, & more, the show was premiering on August 23, 2015, a part of GMA 7's 65th Anniversary Offering. ==In Philippine folklore== Juan Tamad is a man who is buried by monkeys who, because of his laziness, thought he was long dead. ==See also== *Juan de la Cruz ==External links== *Manuel and Lyd Arguilla's Juan Tamad Stories *Juan Tamad and the Flea-Killer ==References== Category:Philippine literature Category:Folklore ","title":"Juan Tamad"},{"id":"12359872","text":"Col de Port (elevation ) is a mountain pass in the French Pyrenees between Massat and Tarascon-sur-Ariège in the \\"massif de l'Arize\\".

He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated. Harding's execution is also noteworthy in that his asphyxiation in the gas chamber took 11 minutes before death was finally confirmed. The prison warden stated that he would quit before ever performing another gas chamber execution. The state attorney general, Grant Woods, was a witness at the execution and Harding spent his last moments cursing out Woods and giving him the middle finger. Contrary to media wire reports at the time, Woods claimed not to have become ill witnessing the execution. This provided momentum for the movement to replace the gas chamber with lethal injection, and in November of that year, Arizona voters approved the change in method, although prisoners sentenced to death prior to November 15, 1992, could still choose the gas chamber. Harding thus became the last prisoner executed in Arizona's gas chamber without having lethal injection as an option (Walter LaGrand, who was sentenced to death in 1982, was executed in the gas chamber at his request). ==See also== * Capital punishment in Arizona * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Arizona ==References Sources == * Inmate 043255 Harding Donald, E.

Most of his victims were abducted from U.S. Route 40, near Bear. ==First murders== Shirley Ellis The first victim was 23-year-old Shirley Anna Ellis, a nurse. On November 29, 1987, she left Wilmington Hospital around 6 PM, where she was aiding an AIDS patient, catching a lift on her way home on Route 40. Her body was later found by the roadside by two boys. She was partially nude, her legs spread out, hands and feet tied with adhesive tape. There were no signs of sexual assault, but she had been seriously abused, with her killer tying a string around her neck and hitting her head with a hammer before she died. Catherine DiMauro The second victim was 31-year-old divorced prostitute Catherine A. DiMauro. On June 28, 1988, about seven months after the first murder, around 11:30 PM, she was seen walking down Route 40, but it was unclear if she was prostituting herself. At 6:25 AM, construction workers found her naked body at a construction site. Her wrists were tied to her feet, her mouth was clogged with adhesive tape, no signs of sexual assault were found. Like Ellis, she was killed by hammer blows and strangulation, but unlike the first murder, DiMauro's body was covered in blue fibers. Special police forces, along with the FBI's profiling unit, concluded that a serial killer was operating in close proximity to Route 40. Police and federal agents disguised as prostitutes in attempt to gather information, with a task force of over 60 people being formed solely to capture the killer, but to no avail. Margaret Lynn Finner On August 22, 1988, 27-year-old prostitute Margaret Lynn Finner disappeared. A number of witnesses had seen her enter a blue Ford driven by a white male near Route 13. About three months later, her body was found floating in the Chesapeake-Delaware Canal. The body was so badly decomposed that the cause of death could not be determined. ==Initial suspicions== On September 14, 1988, Renée Tashner, an undercover cop posing as a prostitute, roamed Route 40 in an attempt to capture the killer. After passing several vehicles, she spotted a blue Ford seven times in 20 minutes. She went to a more isolated area, and the vehicle stopped next to her. The driver was white, with Tashner noticing that the floor had a blue carpet. The man appeared nervous, hardly looking her in the eyes, but still attempted to convince her to enter the car. She refused, claiming that she was tired, but managed to tear some fiber from the blue carpet and write down the license plate number. Upon examination of several license plates, it emerged that the vehicle belonged to Stephen Brian Pennell, a 31-year-old electrician, married and father of two, with no criminal record. ==Additional murders== Michele Gordon Two days later, 22-year-old Michele Gordon, a local sex worker known for frequenting Route 40, disappeared. Witnesses saw her enter a blue Ford, identified as a panel car. On September 20th, her body was found on the rocks in the Chesapeake-Delaware Canal. In the autopsy, it was discovered that she had been drugged with cocaine, which had caused her heart to stop before the torture had begun. Kathleen Meyer On September 23rd, 26-year-old Kathleen Anne Meyer, of Brookmont Farms, disappeared. A police officer saw her get into a blue Ford on Route 40, at 9:30 PM. He was able to write down the license plate number, which turned out to belong to Pennell's car. Her body was never found. ==Capture== Delaware public prosecutor Charles Oberly approved a police search warrant of the panel van, while at the same time searching for other offences they could arrest Pennell. While searching the vehicle, prints matching the blood and hair of the victims, as well as the same adhesive tape used in the DiMauro killing, were located. A \\"torture kit\\" was also found, which included pliers, whips, handcuffs, needles, knives and restraints. Pennell was arrested on November 29, 1988, a year after he murdered the first victim, and was charged with killing three - Ellis, DiMauro and Gordon. He decided to enact his right to remain silent. ==Trial== At the start of the trial, a panel of defense attorneys claimed that the initial fiber taken by Officer Tashner was obtained illegally, because it was taken from his car. Judge Richard Gebelein dismissed these allegations, saying that the carpet was visible to Tashner's eyes as soon as she opened the vehicle, so evidence from these fibers was legal. Once the fibers were examined, it was shown that they had DNA residues belonging to the victims. It was the first trial in the United States that used DNA evidence as absolute legal evidence. Judge Gebelein had to set a legal precedent and listen to the opinions of experts and scientists, who helped verify the DNA evidence. However, the strongest evidence against Pennell was the testimony of his lawyer, who decided to stop representing him because of the things he heard. He testified that Steven had told him how he picked up DiMauro, paid her for sex and then killed her. He added that his former client showed no remorse for his actions, and spoke without emotion. This testimony caused a great deal of shock among the jury. The psychiatrists ruled that Pennell's sanity was questionable, but he was still charged with three homicides. The jury deliberated for eight days, setting a record for longest hearing in Delaware legal history. ==First judgment== On November 23, 1989, the jury reached a decision and convicted Pennell of murdering DiMauro and Ellis, but acquitted him of Gordon's murder because of lack of evidence. The jury decided not to recommend the death penalty, but two life sentences. Shortly after the decision, a bouquet of flowers was sent to the prosecutor's office, with a note reading: \\"You made us feel human again, from the women of Route 40.\\" Pennell's lawyer appealed the court's decision on the grounds that the fiber was obtained illegally. The court dismissed it, and based on new evidence introduced in the case, convicted Steven of murdering Gordon and Meyer. At this point, Pennell dismissed his lawyer and asked to represent himself, a decision the court approved. In a surprising move, he announced that he wished to receive the death penalty. He argued that the entire constitution began with a verse from the Hebrew Bible, and as soon as the court found two witnesses who could testify to his guilt, he deserved the death penalty under the Bible's laws. He cited two passages from the Bible to explain his position. ==Second judgment== On October 31, 1991, the court sentenced Pennell to death. Under the Delaware State Constitution, every death penalty judgment requires a further hearing from the Supreme Court, and on February 11, 1992, Pennell appeared before them, demanding that he be sentenced to death. He was the only defendant in Delaware's legal history to represent himself before the Supreme Court, and the only man convicted to willingly seek the death penalty. However, he pled not guilty to the murders, and spoke of all crime as a third party, saying that the killer was enjoying the process of the murder, but not the murder itself. The Delaware State Attorney General objected to the death penalty, but the judges sentenced Pennell to death anyway. His execution was scheduled for March 14, 1992. ==Appeals== Two people appealed against Pennell's execution, but both were unanimously dismissed by the court. His wife, Vera Catherine Pennell, appealed the Supreme Court's decision. She received help from the local branch of the American Citizens Association, and a law professor who was one of its directors. He argued in his appeal that Pennell was insane and could not fully understand the gravity of his actions, so the trial should be reopened, with Pennell being barred from representing himself. The Supreme Court rejected the demand. ==Execution== Prior to the execution, numerous reporters tried to ask Pennell for exclusive interviews, hoping to reveal the location of Meyer's body. He turned down every request. When it came close to his execution date, he agreed to be interviewed by one newspaper, with his lawyer present. During this interview, Pennell revealed no new information, nor where he had hidden Meyer's body. On March 14, 1992, at 9:49 PM, Pennell was executed by lethal injection, becoming the first person executed in Delaware in 46 years, and the 165th person to be executed in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States == References == Category:1957 births Category:1992 deaths Category:1987 murders in the United States Category:1988 murders in the United States Category:20th-century executions by Delaware Category:20th-century executions of American people Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Place of birth missing Category:Executed American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:People convicted of murder by Delaware Category:People executed by Delaware by lethal injection Category:People from New Castle County, Delaware Category:People executed for murder ","title":"Steven Brian Pennell"},{"id":"12359967","text":"\\"El Negro\\" is the nickname of: *Fernando \\"El Negro\\" Chamorro (1933-1994), Nicaraguan rebel *Roberto Fontanarrosa (1944-2007), Argentine cartoonist * Alejandro González Iñárritu (born 1963), Mexican director *Horacio Hernandez (born 1963), Cuban drummer *Juan Matta-Ballesteros (born 1945), a Honduran drug lord *Negro of Banyoles, a southern African man whose body was on display in the Darder Museum of Banyoles until 2000 *Jorge \\"El Negro\\" Pabon, a close friend of Pablo Escobar's *Martín Ramírez (born 1960), a Colombian cyclist * Carl \\"El Negro\\" Bruce (born 1986), Activist ==See also== * Negro (disambiguation) ","title":"El Negro"},{"id":"12359969","text":"St. James' Roman Catholic Church is located at 32 James Street between St. James Place and Madison Street in the Two Bridges neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. It is the second oldest Roman Catholic building in the city, built in 1835-37 of fieldstone, with a pair of Doric columns flanking the entrance. While the neo-Classical church is modeled on the published designs by Minard Lefever, and is sometimes attributed to him, there is no hard evidence of this being true., p.210-11 The building was once topped by a domed cupola. ==History== The parish was established by Bishop John Dubois in order to relieve the overcrowding at St. Peter's on Barclay Street. He purchased an Episcopal church building on Ann Street, retaining the name of Christ Church, and asked Father Félix Varela to organize a congregation. Fr. Varela also established a free school. In October 1833, it was discovered that nearby excavation had rendered Christ Church unsound. Pending the completion of a new building on James Street, premises were rented at 33 Ann Street. However, some members of the congregation finding this too far uptown, instead purchased the Reformed Presbyterian church on Chambers Street. This would become the parish of the Transfiguration, with Fr. Varela as the first pastor.Lafort, Remigius. The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X, Catholic editing Company, 1914, p. 336 The first Mass was said in the basement of the James St. church on September 18, 1836. The following January it was dedicated under the invocation of St. James the Apostle, by Bishop Dubois. Andrew Byrne was appointed rector. Byrne was succeeded in 1842 by Rev. John Maginnis, who was in turn followed by Rev. John N. Smith. In 1848 Fr. Smith succumbed to \\"ship fever\\" contracted when administering last rites to Father Murphy of Staten Island, who had contracted the illness while tending recently arrived immigrants. Alfred E. Smith served as an altar boy at this church when he was a student at its parochial school, the former St. James Elementary School, located across the street. The church was ordered to be closed by New York City officials in 1983, because of the danger of its roof collapsing. It was scheduled to be torn down in 1986, but was saved by the efforts of the community, especially the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the first branch of which was organized in the church in 1836. The building suffered significant damage in a fire on January 11, 2011.Cunningham, Jennifer H. and Paddock, Barry. \\"Firefighters Save Historic Manhattan Church,\\" New York Daily News (January 11, 2011) In 2007, St. James Parish merged with the nearby Parish of St. Joseph.

He had been chosen as successor to Aribert by the people in opposition to the choice of the noblesse and confirmed as archbishop by the Emperor Henry III. Guido was the archbishop of Milan at a time when the Pataria was gaining force in the city. Riot and unrest was a daily affair and Guido is reputed to have had a hand in much of it. He opposed the Papal reforms and the Patarines who sought to outlaw clerical marriage and concubinage; he was a simoniac himself. Because he also refused to abide by the compromise of 1044, which would have limited his powers, he found himself at odds with the communards and the lesser nobility as well as the reform school. After the death of Henry III in 1056, Hildebrand, Anselm of Baggio, and Peter Damian were sent to settle matters in Milan, but to little avail. The peace they brokered was broken incessantly until 1067, when Guido gave up his see and recommended the subdeacon Gotofredo da Castiglione to the Emperor Henry IV (for a price). Guido was convinced by Anselm of Baggio, now pope, to repent of his abdication and return to his post. He died a few years later and Henry tried again (uncanonically) to appoint Gotofredo. ==Sources== * *Jordan, William Chester (2003). Europe in the High Middle Ages. London: Viking.

The film was critically acclaimed and is regarded amongst Benegal's best works. == Plot == 13-year-old Riyaz (Amit Phalke) lives a poor lifestyle in Bombay, India, with his grandmother, Fayyuzi (Surekha Sikri), and her sister, Mehmooda Begum, alias Mammo (Farida Jalal). Quite outspoken and embittered over his dad abandoning him, Riyaz does not have many friends, save for Rohan. When Mammo plans a surprise birthday party for him, Riyaz is offended as he believes his friends will make fun of him as his lifestyle is not as good as theirs. Fayyuzi and Riyaz have an argument with Mammo, and she leaves for the mosque at Haji Ali; she returns when they apologize. Although Mammo was born in Panipat during the British Raj, she was one of thousands of Muslims who left for Pakistan after Partition. She and her husband automatically became Pakistani citizens. Although childless, her marriage is a happy one until her husband's death. Over property matters, Mammo is thrown out of the house by her relatives. Having nowhere else to go, she came to live with her widowed sister in Bombay on a temporary visa. Every month she walks to the nearest police station to get an extension. She finally paid Rs.4800 as a bribe to get a permanent visa through Inspector Apte. When Apte was transferred, a new police inspector took over, processed her papers, took her to be an illegal immigrant, arrested her, had her escorted to the Bombay Central Railway Station and forced her to board the Frontier Mail, which would return her to Pakistan. Riyaz and Fayyuzi make every possible attempt to trace and bring her back, all in vain. Now 20 years later, Riyaz has grown up and has written a book about his Mammo, hoping that someday, somewhere she will find it and they will be reunited. The movie touches upon several emotional aspects of day-to- day life. Unable to extend her visa, she is deported back to Pakistan. Political priorities defeat humanitarian ones. The director shows a happy ending where Mammo comes to Riyaz and her sister at the end. She pretends that she is dead so that she can continue to stay in India thereafter. == Cast and characters == * Farida Jalal as Mammo * Surekha Sikri as Fayyazi * Amit Phalke as Riyaz (Teenager) * Rajit Kapoor as Riyaz (Adult) * Lalit Tiwari as Riyaz's father * Himani Shivpuri as Anwari, Mammo's sister * Shrivallabh Vyas as Sabir * Sandeep Kulkarni as Inspector Apte * Salim Shah as Taxi Driver * Rupal Patel as Lady Constable == Songs == Mammo has just one famous title song,\\"Yeh Faasle Teri Galiyon Ke Humse Taye Na Huye\\", which enthrals a emotional feeling of attachment to our native land, penned by noted writer, director, lyricist Gulzar Music was composed by Vanraj Bhatia and sung by legendary Jagjit Singh 2:58 \\"Yeh Faasle Teri Galiyon Ke Humse Taye Na Huye\\". \\\\- { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 35%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"   left;\\"  Song = \\"Yeh Faasle Teri Galiyon Ke Humse Taye Na Huye\\"https://www.hindigeetmala.net/song/ye_faasale_teri_galiyon_ke.htm \\\\- Music Director = Vanraj Bhatia \\\\- Lyricist = Gulzar \\\\- Composer = Vanraj Bhatia \\\\- Singer = Jagjit Singh \\\\- Ye Faasle Teri Galiyo Ke Hamase Tay Na Hue https://www.hindiraag.com/ye-faasle-teri-galiyon-ka-lyrics/ Hazaar Baar Ruke Ham Hazaar Baar Chale Hazaar Baar Ruke Ham Hazaar Baar Chale \\\\- Na Jaane Kaun Si Matti Watan Ki Matti Thi Na Jaane Kaun Si Matti Watan Ki Matti Thi Nazar Me Dhul Jigar Me Liye Gubaar Chale Hazaar Baar Ruke Ham Hazaar Baar Chale Hazaar Baar Ruke Ham Hazaar Baar Chale \\\\- Ye Kaisi Sarahade Uljhi Hui Hai Pairo Me Ye Kaisi Sarahade Uljhi Hui Hai Pairo Me Ham Apane Ghar Ki Taraf Uth Ke Baar Baar Chale Hazaar Baar Ruke Ham Hazaar Baar Chale -   left;\\"  Gulzar -   right;\\"  } ==References External links == * Category:1994 drama films Category:1994 films Category:Indian films Category:1990s Hindi-language films Category:Films directed by Shyam Benegal Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actress National Film Award-winning performance Category:Films set in Mumbai Category:Best Hindi Feature Film National Film Award winners Category:National Film Development Corporation of India films ","title":"Mammo"},{"id":"12360068","text":"Babes in Toyland is a 1997 American Christmas animated musical-comedy film based on the 1903 operetta. Directed by Charles Grosvenor, Toby Bluth, and Paul Sabella, the film stars Joseph Ashton, Lacey Chabert, Raphael Sbarge, Cathy Cavadini, Charles Nelson Reilly, Susan Silo, James Belushi, Bronson Pinchot, Christopher Plummer and Lindsay Schnebly. It was released direct-to- video in the United States. == Plot == It's three days before Christmas, as the conductor aboard the Toyland Express, Humpty Dumpty (Charles Nelson Reilly), meets two children, Jack and Jill (Joseph Ashton and Lacey Chabert), who are on their way to Toyland. After meeting Tom Piper (Raphael Sbarge) and Mary (Cathy Cavadini), who runs her late father's toy factory, they go to live with their uncle, the evil Barnaby Crookedman (Christopher Plummer), who despises toys and keeps Jack and Jill in the attic. He has plans to shut down the toy factory, and earlier shot down Tom's hot air balloon as he was flying over the Goblin Forest in an attempt to get him eaten by goblins (and is quite shocked to see him alive). Jack and Jill sneak out and go to the Toy Factory, which had received a big order from Santa Claus requesting a thousand giant toy soldiers. Just as Jack and Jill offer to help, Barnaby takes them back to the attic of his house and threatens to send them to the Goblin Forest if they go near the toy factory again. Shortly afterward, he hires two crooks named Gonzargo and Rodrigo (James Belushi and Bronson Pinchot) to sabotage the toy factory. Jack and Jill sneak out and go to the toy factory again, where Gonzargo and Rodrigo, disguised as sheep, drop a monkey wrench into one of the machines, Jack manages to remove it before the machine can explode. Jack and Jill immediately suspect Gonzargo and Rodrigo, though believing them to be sheep, and chase after them, resulting in Rodrigo and Gonzargo being knocked into a well by a ram and Jack and Jill, respectively, get knocked down by an empty pail and fall down the hill again. Barnaby catches Jack and Jill and orders Gonzargo and Rodrigo, who expose the children's interference with the sabotage, to take them to the Goblin Forest. There, they meet the evil Goblin King (Lindsay Schnebly) who tries eat Gonzargo and Rodrigo. Mr. Dumpty informs Tom and Mary, who go to the forest to rescue them. As the goblins are weak against light, they use a flashlight to fight them off and escape. Barnaby knocks Mr. Dumpty over a bridge (while giving a mockery saying of the nursery rhyme which bears the egg's name) for the key to the factory and tries to enter it, but is stopped by Tom, Mary, Jack, Jill, Gonzargo, and Rodrigo, and is forced to retreat. As Tom and Mary finish the Toy Factory's order and fall in love, Barnaby leads the goblins to Toyland, where they invade, setting fire to the buildings and roasting Gonzargo and Rodrigo on a spit. Tom activates the toy soldiers, who soundly defeat the goblins and put out the fire, saving all of Toyland (including Gonzargo and Rodrigo). As Barnaby insults the Goblin King, who tries to kill him, but Jack, Jill, and all the toy soldiers shine lights on him, destroying the Goblin King. Barnaby calls him a \\"pathetic ogre\\", and the other goblins confront him and chase him off, out of Toyland (though whether they finally catch him and eat him is unclear). Finally Christmas arrives; Tom has repaired Mr. Dumpty. Santa magically shrinks the toy soldiers down to the size of action figures and loads them into his bag. He notices Barnaby's cat, Scat, who is now homeless since Barnaby's disappearance; he picks her up and pets her. Jill asks for Scat, and just as she gets her, Santa continues on his journey. In the end, Jack and Jill become the adopted children of Tom and Mary. == Cast == * Joseph Ashton as Jack * Lacey Chabert as Jill * Raphael Sbarge as Tom Piper * Cathy Cavadini as Mary * Charles Nelson Reilly as Mr. Humpty Dumpty * Susan Silo as Scat * Jim Belushi as Gonzargo * Bronson Pinchot as Rodrigo * Christopher Plummer as Barnaby Crookedman * Lindsay Schnebly as Goblin King * Kevin Michael Richardson as Goblin King’s roars (uncredited) * Steve Mackall as Goblin vocal effects (uncredited) == Musical numbers == # \\"Toyland\\" – Mr. Humpty Dumpty # \\"Mr. Humpty Dumpty's Toyland / The Aerial Ballet\\" – Mr. Humpty Dumpty # \\"Dream\\" – Jack, Jill, Tom Piper, and Mary # \\"The Factory Song\\" – Tom Piper, Mary, and Company # \\"A Crooked Man\\" – Barnaby Crookedman # \\"The Worst Is Yet to Come\\" – Gonzargo, and Rodrigo # \\"It's You\\" – Tom Piper, and Mary == Release == MGM/UA Home Video released Babes in Toyland direct-to-video on October 14, 1997 when this film was actually meant to be released to theaters. == Reception == TV Guide rated it 3/5 stars and called it \\"fine entertainment for its intended audience\\".

Although the game does feature Joe Montana (as the title respectively says) as a playable character, since Sega did not obtain licenses from either the NFL or the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), teams are named generically after US cities, meaning Joe Montana is the only real player in the game. It was the first game in what would become Sega's NFL Football video game series. ==Gameplay== Similar to other football games of the time, the gameplay follows a slightly simplified version of standard American Football rules. Players have the option to play as different teams, as well as select number of players. Players also have the option to turn penalties on or off. Players may also play a normal game, a mode with a two-minute drill, and the Sega Bowl mode. Though Joe Montana Football and John Madden Football were made by the same company, Madden had realistic plays and a full roster of 28 teams, while Montana was a more arcade-style game with only 16 teams and a simplified, passing-intensive offense. ==Development== Following the launch of the Genesis in the United States, Sega of America president and CEO Michael Katz planned to create a library of instantly-recognizable titles for the console by contracting with celebrities and athletes to produce games using their names and likenesses. As part of this, Sega signed a US$1.7 million five-year contract with Joe Montana, despite concerns among the Japanese executives that the game would not earn enough to cover this cost. Since Sega of America did not at the time have a large game production facility and Sega Enterprises had never designed a football game, Sega contracted with Mediagenic to develop the game for November 1989. No one at Sega was aware of the turmoil inside Mediagenic at the time; despite five months of reports that development was proceeding on schedule, Katz discovered in September or October that the game was hardly begun. To have a football game for Christmas release, Sega would have to find an already-completed game that could be converted. Sega approached Electronic Arts, developer of the Madden NFL series, and president Trip Hawkins, for help, suggesting that he cancel the upcoming Genesis version of Madden in order to work on the game. Hawkins agreed to help Sega but refused to cancel his company's game instead working on both projects. He intentionally made Montana a worse game than Madden, starting with the basic code for the former he removed the 3D field as well as cut down the number of plays from 113 to 100. According to Michael Knox a programmer on the game, most of the deliberate downgrading occurred after the company had already completed the game. Joe Montana Football missed the Christmas deadline and was released in January 1991, shortly after the Genesis version of John Madden Football. ==Reception== Although not as successful as the Madden series, Joe Montana Football and the sequels helped establish the Genesis' reputation as the top platform for sports simulations and proved to Sega Enterprises that sports games could be worthwhile investments. Website Den of Geek would credit both series for helping Sega gain an edge over Nintendo writing \\" High school and college jocks who would normally be more likely to taunt someone who identified as a video game nerd suddenly found themselves playing for bragging rights on all-night sessions of Madden.\\" ==Legacy== Joe Montana Football was followed by four sequels, all developed by BlueSky Software instead of Electronic Arts: Joe Montana Football II: Sports Talk Football, NFL Sports Talk Football '93, NFL Football '94 Starring Joe Montana, and NFL '95. After the contract with Joe Montana ended in 1995, development on the sixth game in Sega's NFL series moved to Farsight Technologies and the franchise was rebranded as Prime Time NFL Starring Deion Sanders. In 2015, Damon Grow, CEO of Superstar Games, tweeted snippets of Joe Montana Football 16. Joe Montana subsequently released a screenshot of the game. At E3, Damon Grow revealed the game as \\"Joe Montana Football\\", a mobile game coming to iOS, followed by Android and PC. ==References== Category:1991 video games Category:DOS games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Joe Montana video games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Master System games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega video games Category:Video games scored by Russell Lieblich Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Joe Montana Football"},{"id":"12360101","text":"The Norman Baronetcy, of Honeyhanger in the Parish of Shottermill in the County of Surrey, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.

They have won four league championships and attendance for home playoff games routinely exceeds one thousand. ==2007-08== The Winterhawks won their first ever game, defeating the Georgian Bay River Rats by a 12-1 score on the road. Saugeen Shores hosted its first ever home game on October 12, when the Shelburne Muskies made a visit, and came out on top with a score of 6-0. The Winterhawks would continue their hot streak, winning their first nine games, before losing their first game in team history, a 5-3 loss to the Elora Rocks. The Winterhawks would continue their winning ways throughout the season, ending up with a 23-3-0 record, first place in the North Division, and a spot in the \\"AA\\" playoffs. The Winterhawks would face the Exeter Mohawks for their first ever playoff series, and the team would win their first playoff game, holding off the Mohawks for a 4-3 victory. Exeter would take the second game in overtime to even the series up, but the Winterhawks would take control of the series, easily defeating the Mohawks by a 6-2 score in the third game, followed by a 5-3 victory in the fourth game. Saugeen Shores would close out the series in the fifth game, winning 5-4, and advance to the \\"AA\\" semi- finals. Saugeen Shores would face the Elora Rocks, the defending \\"AA\\" champions in the semi-finals. Elora would take the opening game in overtime, but the Winterhawks stormed back to win the next two games by scores of 5-4 and 7-4 to take a 2-1 series lead. Elora fought back to tie the series up again in the fourth game, then the Rocks would put Saugeen Shores on the brink of elimination with a 6-5 victory in the fifth game. Elora would end the Winterhawks season with an overtime goal in the sixth game, as they won the series 4-2. ==2008-09== Saugeen Shores would again have a very impressive regular season, as they would have the best record in the North Division for the second consecutive season, as they finished the season with a 16-3-1 record, earning 33 points. The Winterhawks opened the post-season against the Drayton Icemen, in a best of seven series with the winner advancing to the \\"AA\\" playoffs. Saugeen Shores opened the series with a blowout victory, defeating Drayton 9-3, and then kept their foot on the gas petal in the second game, winning 7-3 to take a 2-0 series lead. The Winterhawks would have their best game in the third game, defeating the Icemen 10-3, followed by a 7-3 win in the fourth game to sweep Drayton. Saugeen Shores opponent in the \\"AA\\" quarter-finals was the Palmerston 81's. Saugeen Shores won the series, 4 games-to-1. The Winterhawks then faced the Shelburne Muskies in the \\"AA\\" Semi- Finals. After racing out to a 3-0 series lead, the Winterhawks allowed the Muskies back into the series with three straight losses, which forced a seventh and deciding game in the series. The Winterhawks won the final game by a score of 3-2 with the overtime winner scored by Ryan Dudgeon. Saugeen Shores then defeated the Tavistock Royals in 5 games to win the WOAA Sr. \\"AA\\" championship, winning the title in just their second year of existence. All home games in the final series had to be played at the Southampton Coliseum. ==2009-2010== Saugeen Shores had a good season, finishing 3rd in the North Division with a record of 12-5-3. They would defeat the Lucknow Lancers and Shelburne Muskies in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but lost to the eventual league champion Elora Rocks in the North Final. ==2010-2011== The Winterhawks finished 22-4-0 at the end of the regular season. They finished at the top of the North Division and went on to sweep the Shallow Lake Crushers 4 - 0 in the first round of the playoffs. The second playoffs round was just as impressive as they finished 4-0 against the Lucknow Lancers and then moved on to the battle for the North Division. The Winterhawks moved on, impressively defeating the winners from last season, Elora Rocks 4-1. Saugeen Shores went on to win against the Southern winner Monkton Wildcats in only 5 games, thus winning the WOAA Sr. \\"AA\\" championship. After four seasons and two championships, head coach Don Matheson announced he was stepping down. He was replaced for the 2011/12 season by assistant coach Jim Grieve, who had also previously played for the Lakeshore Winterhawks. ==2011-2012== The Winterhawks finished the regular season with a record of 23-1-0, with their only loss at the hands of the Shelburne Muskies. In the first round of the playoffs, they downed the Lucknow Lancers in four straight games. In the North Division semi- final, the 'Hawks beat the Durham Thundercats in another four game sweep. The Winterhawks met the rival Elora Rocks for the North championship and again prevailed in the minimum four games. The Winterhawks met the Tavistock Royals in the league championship series, and completed a clean sweep of the playoffs, winning in four games and securing their second league championship in a row. Following the season, head coach Jim Grieve stepped down. ==2012-2013== Port Elgin native and Lakeshore Winterhawks alum Peter Roedger was named head coach in July 2012. The Winterhawks opened their quest for a third-consecutive championship with three new faces, as Andy Mitchell, Marc Roedger and Adam Shular joined the team, while Matt Turcotte, Jordan Lang and Greg Virgo did not return. Forward Tyler Kennedy joined the club midway through the season, while James McHaig & Ryan Dudgeon left the club. They would open the season with a 5-2 win over the Shallow Lake Crushers, but would drop their home opener to the Mapleton-Minto 81's less than a week later. The Winterhawks would lose consecutive games for the first time since 2009 with a loss to the Ripley Wolves the following night. Forward Bryan Kazarian co- captured the league scoring title with 54 points (17 goals, 33 assists), sharing the honour with Ryan Stephenson of the Komoka Classics. It marked the first time in franchise history that a Winterhawks player had won the scoring title. The Winterhawks finished the regular season with a record of 16-7-1, good enough for 2nd place in the North Division. The Winterhawks faced off against the Mapleton-Minto 81's in a best-of-7 North Division quarterfinal to start the playoffs. Mapleton-Minto would put a scare into the Winterhawks, forcing overtime in Game 2, but Saugeen Shores ended up prevailing, 5-4. In the remaining three games, Saugeen Shores outscored the 81's by a margin of 26-2, sweeping the series in four games. The North Division semi-final opponent for the Winterhawks was the rival Shelburne Muskies. The Winterhawks swept the Muskies after a nail-biter of a Game 3 with the final score being 4-3 and the 'Hawks scoring 4 unanswered goals in the last 10 minutes of the 3rd. The Winterhawks faced off against the Elora Rocks in the North Division final again and prevailed in six games. The theme of familiar foes continued in the league final, as the Winterhawks took on the Tavistock Royals for the second straight year and third time overall. Tavistock jumped out to an early lead, thumping the Winterhawks 5-2 in the opener. The Winterhawks roared back with back-to-back overtime victories to put themselves ahead, but dropped Game 4 to the Royals, 5-1. The Winterhawks again used overtime to secure victory, taking a 4-3 decision on the road in Game 5. Using a home crowd of more than 1,000 to their advantage, the Winterhawks defeated Tavistock in Game 6 to secure their third-straight league championship. General Manager Scott Jamieson and Assistant Coach Don MacLeod stepped down shortly after the win. ==2013-2014== On Sept. 7th, the Winterhawks announced Matheson was returning to the club, taking over the role of general manager, while Mark Kazarian was joining the coaching staff as an assistant coach. Several new faces joined the Winterhawks for the 2013 season. Dustin Mantha, Jim Nesbitt, Greg Wardell, Kyle Roulston, Mitch Roulston, Nick Brown, Mike Bujold, Adam Alexander and Chris King all made their Winterhawks debut during the season. Goaltender Joe Kirkland signed late in the regular season and served as a back-up, but did not see any action during the regular season. The Winterhawks were yet again near the top of the standings all season long, posting an 11-game winning streak at one point. However, three shootout losses in their final five games ended up costing the Winterhawks first place, finishing in third behind the Mapleton-Minto 81's and the Elora Rocks. The Winterhawks defeated the Ripley Wolves in the first round of the \\"AA\\" playoffs, but fell in five games to Elora in the second round. It ended the Winterhawks three-year run as league champions. Overall, the Winterhawks finished the season with a record of 18-3-3. ==2014-2015== The Winterhawks again experienced some turnover in the lineup, with Dustin Mantha, Jim Nesbitt, Mike Bujold, Ryan Fry, Nick Brown and Jeff Young departing. They were replaced by Andy Fracz, Dave Grant, Jacob Brown, Jordan Smith, Scott Komer, Trent Hawke and Justin Ainslie. The Winterhawks were again among the elite teams in the North Division, spending a majority of the season in 1st place. The team lost three games in a row to end the month of October, but rallied to reel off an impressive 14 victories in their next 15 games. Mapleton-Minto and Durham went on runs of their own to keep pace with the Winterhawks, and while they were able to defeat the 81's on the second-to-last game of the season, it was sandwiched around losses to Durham and the Ripley Wolves, which allowed Durham to finish in 1st place. Kazarian again lead the team in scoring, capturing his second career league scoring title. The Winterhawks faced off against the 81's in the first round of the playoffs, dropping the series in six games, in large part due to a bevy of injuries that left the squad with only a handful of healthy bodies by the end of the series. Assistant coach Doug Mitchell stepped down after the season. ==2015-2016== The team brought in a trio of captains from the junior-C ranks to start the season, acquiring Jay Thomson (Walkerton Hawks), Brett Brophy (Wingham Ironmen) and Mike Smailes (Kincardine Bulldogs), along with goaltenders Josh Sturrock & Blake Sinclair, and forwards Dylan Weltz and Alex Penner, who had just wrapped up an eight-year professional career. Defenceman Justin Ainslie and goaltender Blake Sinclair joined the team mid-season. Joe Kirkland, Shawn Walker, Adam Alexander, Tyler Kennedy, Jason Hutchinson, Matt Turcotte and Darrell Cowen were among those who departed. The team filled the vacancy created by Doug Mitchell's departure by re-hiring Jim Grieve as an assistant coach. The team uncharacteristically struggled early on, posting a 1-4-0 record in October. A four-game winning streak followed, but another poor stretch of 1-4-1 put a playoff spot in question. With healthy bodies returning to the lineup, the team got on a roll, posting an 8-0-1 record to finish the regular season to finish in 3rd place in the North Division. The final game of the regular season saw the Winterhawks turn back the clock with vintage Port Elgin Sunocos jerseys, which raised more than $6,000 for charity. The Winterhawks faced off against the Durham Thundercats in the 1st round of the playoffs. After opening the series with a 5-3 win, Durham stormed back and took the next two, by 4-0 and 3-1 scores. The Winterhawks reeled off three victories in a row to take the series in six games. In the North Division final, the Winterhawks met up with the powerhouse Mapleton-Minto 81's, who had lost just twice all season and were coming off a sweep of the Shallow Lake Crushers. Mapleton-Minto took the first game 5-2, but the Winterhawks scored late in Game 2 to take a 3-2 victory to even the series. Game 3 saw Mapleton- Minto win by a 6-2 score in a game that featured 108 penalty minutes. Injuries began to mount for the Winterhawks, who saw key players go down throughout the series, including their starting goaltender. Game 4 saw Mapleton-Minto win 4-3 in overtime, though the Winterhawks were able to erase a two-goal deficit to force the extra frame. Mapleton-Minto took the series in five games with a 5-4 overtime win in Game 5, but again it was the Winterhawks who battled to the very end, scoring twice in the final two minutes of regulation to force overtime. Injuries again played a major role, as the Winterhawks saw another goaltender go down to injury in Game 5. ==Season-by-Season record== Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T= Tie, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against { - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dddddd\\"  Season  GP  W  L  T  OTL  GF  GA  PTS FinishPlayoffs - align=\\"center\\"  2007-08  26  23  3  -  0  172  69  46  1st WOAA North  Lost \\"AA\\" SF - align=\\"center\\"  2008-09  20  16  3  -  1  135  72  33  1st WOAA North  Won \\"AA\\" Championship - align=\\"center\\"  2009-10  20  12  5  -  3  112  86  27  3rd WOAA North  Lost \\"AA\\" SF - align=\\"center\\"  2010-11  26  22  4  -  0  132  78  44  1st WOAA North  Won \\"AA\\" Championship - align=\\"center\\"  2011-12  24  23  1  -  0  151  58  46  1st WOAA North  Won \\"AA\\" Championship - align=\\"center\\"  2012-13  24  16  7  -  1  122  67  33  2nd WOAA North  Won \\"AA\\" Championship - align=\\"center\\"  2013-14  24  18  3  -  3  126  72  39  3rd WOAA North  Lost North SF - align=\\"center\\"  2014-15  24  18  5  -  1  132  82  37  2nd WOAA North  Lost \\"AA\\" QF - align=\\"center\\"  2015-16  24  14  8  -  2  105  74  30  3rd WOAA North  Lost \\"AA\\" SF - align=\\"center\\"  2016-17  20  18  1  -  1  114  42  37  1st WOAA Sr  Lost \\"AA\\" SF - align=\\"center\\"  2017-18  20  10  9  -  1  99  57  21  6th WOAA Sr  Lost \\"AA\\" QF - align=\\"center\\"  2018-19  22  14  7  -  1  103  74  29  4th WOAA Sr  Lost \\"AA\\" SF - align=\\"center\\"  2019-20  22  16  6  -  0  101  64  32  3rd WOAA Sr  Lost \\"AA\\" QF - align=\\"center\\"  2020-21  efefef\\" colspan=\\"11\\" Did Not Play - Season Cancelled Due to COVID-19 pandemic } ==Roster== Source: Goalies 30 - Matt Tutin 33 - Eric Peicheff 34 - Jeff Flagler Defence 6 - Justin Ainslie 10 - Josh Deyell 11 - Chad Schockenmaier 15 - Mike Smailes 19 - Nick Quaid 24 - Trevor Smith \\"C\\" 29 - Josh Hopkin 44 - Adam Little Forwards 9 - Bryan Kazarian 12 - Jay Thomson 13 - Miles MacLean 14 - James McHaig 16 - Andy Mitchell \\"A\\" 17 - Andy Fracz 18 - Michael Johnstone 20 - Blake Underwood \\"A\\" 21 - Connor Patton 22 - Jamie Shoemaker 28 - Curtis Johnston \\"A\\" 37 - Lauchlin Elder 88 - Matt Shields 91 - Trent Hawke 93 - Mike Rocca ==Related links== *Saugeen Shores, Ontario *Western Ontario Athletic Association *WOAA Senior Hockey League ==ReferencesExternal links== *Saugeen Shores Winterhawks *WOAA *WOAA Senior Hockey *Saugeen Shores Winterhawks YouTube Channel *Saugeen Shores Winterhawks Twitter Account Category:Ice hockey teams in Ontario Category:Senior ice hockey teams ","title":"Saugeen Shores Winterhawks"},{"id":"12360121","text":"The Geological Museum of China (), built in 1916, is a geological museum, boasting 200 thousand specimens.http://www.mlr.gov.cn/dzhj/gswhs/hszl/zjbwg/db/ left This museum is located in the Xisi area of Beijing and opened on October 1, 1959. It is the earliest geological scientific museum of China. At present, the Geological Museum of China has more than 100,000 geological specimens.

The paleontology hall itself is labeled with an image of a trilobite. The first third of the gallery showcases many fossils from the Cambrian explosion and fossilized plants. As the hall turns, a Cymbospondylus fossil is mounted on the wall. A small circular gallery is covered on the walls by a mural, and the glass floor contains many dinosaur bones. As the hall turns back, an partial dinosaur skeleton labeled \\"Anchisaurus sinensis\\" is displayed on the wall. The next section of the gallery puts on display a scenario from Cretaceous Mongolia, mounting several Velociraptor specimens harassing a nesting Oviraptor. A Tyrannosaurus rex skull cast is mounted on the wall. In many display cases encircling this section, specimens and casts of beautifully preserved dinosaur and bird specimens from Liaoning are displayed. In another display case, a bone and teeth of a tyrannosaurid labeled \\"Tyrannosaurus zhuchengensis\\" are set.

Its binomial name commemorates the German naturalist and explorer Eduard Rüppell. ==Description== The northern white-crowned shrike is a 19–23-cm long passerine. The adult has a white crown and rump, black eyestripe, brown back and wings and black tail. The throat, breast and belly are white, and the flanks are brown. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have a brown crown, white head sides, and grey breast. The flight is parrot-like. Several subspecies have been described, but there is extensive individual variation in plumage. Although birds in the north of the range are larger than in the south, the difference is clinal and the northern white-crowned shrike may be monotypic. The calls are high-pitched squawks, squeaks and chatters, including kek-kek and chee-chee. ==Behaviour== The northern white-crowned shrike is gregarious, occurring in groups of up 12 birds. It hunts from an exposed perch, feeding mainly on large insects, usually taken from the ground. It also will feed from the backs of large mammals, like an oxpecker, and occasionally will eat fruit which has fallen to the ground. The neat thick- walled cup nest is constructed from grass and spider webs in a horizontal tree fork 4–6 metres above the ground. The two to four white or lilac eggs are blotched with grey, purple or brown. It is likely that cooperative breeding occurs, given the gregarious habits of this species and the known cooperative breeding of the closely related southern white-crowned shrike. ==References== * Harris and Franklin, Shrikes & Bush Shrikes (Christopher Helm, 2000) northern white-crowned shrike Category:Birds of East Africa northern white- crowned shrike ","title":"Northern white-crowned shrike"},{"id":"12360258","text":"Bedřich Smetana Museum The Bedřich Smetana Museum (Muzeum Bedřicha Smetany) in Prague is a museum which is dedicated to the life and works of famous Czech composer Bedřich Smetana (1824-1884). It is situated in the centre of Prague in a small block of buildings right next to Charles Bridge on the right bank of the river Vltava in the Old Town (Novotného lávka 1, 110 00 Praha 1). The building, which was formerly owned by Prague Water Company, has housed the Smetana Museum since 1936. It is a grand building in the Renaissance style. The main part of the museum exhibits are on the first floor. The upper floors house archive material relating to Smetana, providing a centre for research. Exhibits include copies of letters, photographs and newspaper cuttings relating to Smetana’s life as well as various possessions including his earbone (Smetana suffered from deafness). There are also folders on music stands which contain material about some of Smetana’s most famous works. The visitor is able to listen to extracts from these works by zapping the required music stand with an electronic baton. Smetana was the leading Czech composer at a time when Czech nationalism was allowed to be expressed through the medium of the arts, which had so long been dominated by the official language, German. The Czech people were searching for their national identity and for the first time had the opportunity to perform plays and operas in the Czech language. The embodiment of this movement was the National Theatre which opened in November 1883 with a performance of a specially written opera by Smetana, Libuše, which deals with the legendary story of the foundation of Prague. His six symphonic poems Má vlast (My Country) describe various aspects of his homeland: its countryside and legends. The second of these tone-poems, Vltava, is especially popular. The main tune is broadcast over the public address system at Prague’s main railway station. The museum is open daily except on Tuesdays. == See also == * List of music museums ==References== * “Czech and Slovak Republics” ==External links== * Official website by Bedřich Smetana Museums Museum Category:Collections of the National Museum in Prague Category:Biographical museums in the Czech Republic Category:Czech nationalism Category:Museums in Prague Category:Music museums in the Czech Republic ","title":"Bedřich Smetana Museum"},{"id":"12360331","text":"Brodac may refer to: * Brodac Donji, a village in the city or municipality of Bijeljina, Bosnia-Herzegovina, east of adjacent village Brodac Gornji * Brodac Gornji, a village in the city or municipality of Bijeljina, Bosnia- Herzegovina, west of adjacent village Broda Donji * Brodac, Novo Sarajevo, in or near Sarajevo, in Bosnia-Herzegovina ","title":"Brodac"},{"id":"12360347","text":"On Tour is a live album by Yann Tiersen.

Cultural Atlas of Ancient Egypt. New York: Checkmark, 2000. Print. At the time, Ancient Egypt was divided into Lower and Upper Egypt, though Middle Egypt was technically a subdivision of Upper Egypt. It was not until the 19th century that archaeologists felt the need to divide Upper Egypt in two. As a result, they coined the term \\"Middle Egypt\\" for the stretch of river between Cairo and the Qena Bend.Richardson, Dan and Jacobs, Daniel (2003) Rough guide to Egypt Rough Guides, London, page 295, It was also associated with a region termed Heptanomis (; Greek: , in Ptol. iv. 5. § 55; more properly or , in Dionysius Periegetes 251; and sometimes ; meaning \\"Seven Nomes\\", a \\"nome\\" being a subdivision of ancient Egypt), generally as the district which separates the Thebaïd from the Delta. Middle Egypt today can be identified as the part of the Nile Valley that, while geographically part of Upper Egypt, is culturally closer to Lower Egypt. For instance, in terms of language, the Egyptian Arabic of people in Beni Suef and northwards shares features with Cairene and particularly rural Delta Arabic rather than with the Sa'idi Arabic spoken further south, and are often not considered Sa'idis. ==Heptanomis== In the 19th century, Heptanomis was described generally as the district which separates the Thebaïd from the Delta. Inasmuch, however, as the appellation of the Seven Nomes is political rather than territorial, it is not easy to define the actual boundaries of this region. The northern portion belonged to the kingdom of Lower Egypt, of which it contained the capital, Memphis; the southern appertained to the elder kingdom of Thebes, so long at least as there continued to be two monarchies in the Nile valley. It is not possible to determine at what period, if indeed at any, the Heptanomis was regarded as an integral third of Egypt. About the number of its nomes there can be no question; but which, at any given era, were the seven principal nomes, it is less easy to decide. They probably varied with the vicissitudes of local prosperity, war, commerce, or migration, from time to time, causing a superior nome to decline, and, on the contrary, raising an inferior nome to eminence. According to Ptolemy and Agatharchides (De Rubr. Mar. ap. Photius Biblioth. p. 1339\\\\. R.), both of whom wrote long after the original divisions had been modified, the Seven Nomes were the following: (1) Memphites; (2) Heracleopolites; (3) Crocodilopolites, renamed Arsinoites; (4) Aphroditopolites; (5) Oxyrhynchites; (6) Cynopolites; and (7) Hermopolites. The Greater and Lesser Oases were always reckoned portions of the Heptanomis, and hence it must apparently have sent nine, and not seven, nomarchs to the general assembly in the Labyrinth. The capitals of the Nomes, whose names are sufficiently indicated by the respective appellations of the divisions themselves, e.g. Hermopolis of the Nomos Hermopolites, etc., were also the chief towns of the Middle Land. This district comprised the three greatest works of Egyptian art and enterprise, e. g., the Pyramids, the Labyrinth, and the artificial district formed by the canal Bahr-Jusuf (Canal of Joseph), the Nomos Arsinoites or the Fayyum (Fyoum). The Heptanomis extended from latitude 27°4′ North to 30° north; its boundary to south was the castle of Hermopolis (), to the north the apex of the Delta and the town of Cercasorum, on the west the irregular line of the Libyan Desert, and on the east, the hills which confine the Nile, or the sinuous outline, the recesses and projections of the Arabian mountains. Thus, near Hermopolis at the southern extremity of this region, the eastern hills approach very near the river, while those on the western or left bank recede to a considerable distance from it. Again, in latitude 29° north, the Libyan hills retire from the vicinity of the Nile, bend toward northwest, and sharply return to it by a curve to east, embracing the province of Arsinoë (formerly Crocodilopolis, now the city of Al Fayyum). Between the hills on which the Pyramids stand and the corresponding elevation of Gebel-el-Mokattam on the eastern bank of the river, the Heptanomis expands, until near Cercasorum it acquires almost the breadth of the subjacent Delta. The Heptanomis is remarkable for its quarries of stone and its rock-grottoes. Besides the Alabastrites, we find to the north of Antinoë the grottoes of Beni Hasan, the Speos Artemidos of the Greeks. Nine miles lower down are the grottoes of Kom el-Ahmar, and in the Arabian desert, on the east, quarries of the beautiful veined and white alabaster, which the Egyptians employed in their sarcophagi, and in the more delicate portions of their architecture. From the quarries of Tourah and Massarah, in the hills of Gebel-el-Mokattam, east of Memphis, they obtained the limestone used in casing the pyramids. The roads from these quarries may still be traced across the intervening plain. Under the Ptolemies the Heptanomis was governed by an (viceroy / prefect), and by an officer of corresponding designation, procurator, under the Roman Caesars. We find the procurator described in inscriptions (Orelli, Inscr. Lat. n. 516) as procurator Augusti epistrategiae Septem Nomorum. Under the later Caesars in the 3rd century, the five northern Nomes, Memphites, Heracleopolites, Arsinoites, Aphroditopolites, and Oxyrhyncites, together with the Nomos Leptopolites, constituted the province of Arcadia Ægypti, which subsequently became a metropolitan episcopal see. The natural productions of the Heptanomis resemble those of Upper Egypt generally, and present a more tropical fauna and flora than those of the Delta. Its population also was less modified by Greek or Nubian admixture than that of either Lower or Upper Egypt; although, after the 4th century, the Heptanomis was overrun by Arabian marauders, who considerably affected the native racial mix. The capitals of the Heptanomis were collectively called the Heptapolis. ==Major cities== * 6th of October City * Beni Suef * Minya * Cairo * Giza * Fayoum ==See also== *Upper Egypt *Lower Egypt *Upper and Lower Egypt *Nomes of Egypt *Geography of Egypt ==NotesReferences== *M.

The fire resulted in of land being burnt, the loss of nine lives, injury to another 115 people, and huge property damage. It was South Australia's worst bushfire since the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983. Heat from the fire reached , with speeds up to . == Ignition: Monday 10 January 2005 == Maximum temperatures were recorded on 10 January 2005 as at Coles Point and at Port Lincoln; winds gusted to . The bushfire began not long after 3 pm in roadside vegetation on Lady Franklyn Road north of the town of Wangary, approximately north-west of Port Lincoln. The source of ignition was subsequently found to have been a vehicle parked in grass on the roadside. The inquest conducted by the Deputy State Coroner concluded that \\"a carbonaceous particle or particles landed in dry vegetation at the side of Lady Franklyn Road and immediately, or virtually immediately, ignited that vegetation\\" from an exhaust system that \\"had a number of irregularities and defects that consisted of holes and imperfect joins in the system. [The] muffler was not a standard part for that vehicle. Compared to the standard muffler that would normally be fitted to a vehicle of that type, the non-standard after-market muffler had a lesser capacity to inhibit the passage of hot carbonaceous particles through it.\\" After the fire was detected, people went to the scene, including farmers in their farm firefighting appliances who had seen the smoke from a distance. Country Fire Service (CFS) appliances and their volunteer crews were also dispatched to the location. It quickly became obvious that sourcing water in this area was a problem; the fire proved difficult to quell under the influence of a strong breeze. Valiant efforts were made to contain the fire during the course of the afternoon, and more CFS appliances arrived. By the evening, the fireground covered with a south-eastern flank of several kilometres.

Measures to counter the fire included fire suppression, blacking out, burning out, backburning, and earthmoving. At 8:54 pm, when the unfavourable weather conditions for firefighting had abated, the fire was judged to be contained. (This carried no implication that the fire was extinguished; the fire was still active in an area of sugar gums and in a swamp.) == Tragedies: Tuesday 11 January 2005 == Overnight, the fire edge extended approximately . The weather forecast for the morning of Tuesday 11 January was very unfavourable for firefighting, suggesting that extreme conditions would exist at 10 am. In the event, just before 10 am the first of several breakouts occurred from the fireground, spreading extremely quickly under strong north-westerly winds.http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news- national/eyre-peninsula-bushfire-not-arson-20090115-7hue.html Maximum temperatures on Tuesday 11 January were recorded as at Coles Point and at Port Lincoln; winds gusted to . During the course of the morning and early afternoon, fire proceeded across the landscape of the Lower Eyre Peninsula in an easterly direction, carried in the main by wheat-stubble fuels. Ultimately it reached North Shields and its beachside caravan park on the east coast north of Port Lincoln's suburbs, and the Port Lincoln Airport and adjacent settlement of Poonindie a further northwards. The worst affected areas were Wangary, North Shields, Wanilla, Poonindie, Louth Bay, Whites Flat, Koppio, Greenpatch and Warunda. Essential services such as electricity, telecommunications and water infrastructure were destroyed. The flames \\"chose their victims at random\\", according to an Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter who interviewed victims on Wednesday 12 January. \\"Half the Port Lincoln Caravan Park at North Shields was spared; the other half, destroyed. As the flames bore down on the caravan park, panicked residents escaped to the ocean.\\" One man, who had escaped to the beach, said \\"It's the worst place for it to come, actually, because there's nowhere to run. That's why a lot of the people here ended up in the water. I rescued a man out of a boat that got washed out to sea with the wind yesterday. They jumped off the cliffs when the fire came. [A neighbour and his daughter] couldn't see the land because of the smoke, and the wind was that strong, it actually pushed them out to sea and they nearly drowned, and some people came along in boats and picked them up, and they ended up on the shore just up the road here, and he was collapsed on the bottom of the boat. He spent the night in hospital.\\" During the Tuesday, the fire claimed the lives of nine people and injured 115, three of whom required urgent hospital treatment in Adelaide.

It was not until 20 January before firefighters finished attending to continuing hazards such as smouldering logs and fenceposts and the fire was finally declared extinguished. == Relief and recovery == The human impact of loss, injury and dislocation, and the loss of treasured possessions and clothing, was immense. As the fire continued its spread across the peninsula, residents provided emergency accommodation and assistance for fire victims at several assembly points. A bushfire recovery centre was set up at Port Lincoln High School and Cummins Bowling Club. The State Recovery Committee, comprising representatives of government agencies and relief organisations, met urgently on 12 January to coordinate prompt agency responses. Personal hardship and distress grants were provided as a priority, including a State Government grant of $10,000 to all farmers affected by the fire to assist with immediate needs; Centrelink payments were prioritised; a hotline service was set up on 12 January, receiving more than 2900 calls in 15 weeks; and extensive measures such as providing shipping containers for storage of salvaged possession were speedily put in place. Donations of goods flooded in, and an Army detachment and people from across Australia joined local people to help with the clean-up – discovering among the devastation such objects as melted headlight glass and aluminium – and undertaking recovery tasks such as re-fencing. Ten years later, on Sunday 11 January 2015, about 200 people packed into the Marble Range Football Club, Wangary, for a 10th anniversary memorial service. State member of parliament for the region, Peter Treloar, who in 2005 was a farmer, said \\"Many people's lives changed for ever that day\\"; but he said he understood that not all wanted to be involved in the commemoration. \\"It's not going to be a day for everyone. I've spoken to some people who did not want to attend.\\" Memorial organiser Benji Callen said people were still healing from the bushfire and attended the memorial with mixed feelings. Among people who had been in the fire who spoke with reporters from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was Lorna Harding, aged 91, who was among those who took refuge in the sea off North Shields. She had watched as the house she was born in and had lived in all her life was destroyed. \\"It just came so fast. Before we knew where we were, we were covered in smoke. But we had the sea to go into so we were right.\\" == Coronial inquest == Between 5 October 2005 and 8 May 2007, South Australia's Deputy State Coroner conducted a coronial inquest that examined a large range of factors connected with the bushfire, taking evidence from 140 witnesses. In his 703-page report released on 18 December 2007, the coroner made 34 wide-ranging recommendations for minimising future bushfire risks, to which the South Australian Government subsequently responded. The report also listed other investigations into the bushfire. An Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program broadcast on the day on which the coronial findings were released stated that \\"The report details a series of miscalculations and miscommunications among firefighters on the ground and their CFS senior officers in Adelaide that resulted in resources being denied until the fire was out of control. According to the Deputy Coroner, miscommunications between senior CFS officers left them unaware how seriously the fire was growing. As a result, critical decisions were delayed. ... There are those critical of the coronial process, arguing it does little to prevent a future bushfire ... civil action is likely to be launched immediately against the CFS and the owner of the vehicle which started the fire by 70 litigants, mostly farmers.\\" A great deal of evidence was given to the inquest about the crucial question of the firefighting and fire suppression strategies that could and/or should have been adopted on the Monday night and the Tuesday morning, but were not. The main focus of activity overnight, attracting much of the available resources, had been on an area of sugar gum trees. The coroner considered it was an unwanted distraction to CFS appliances that might otherwise have been available to work elsewhere. Only a very limited amount of suppression work was undertaken on the eastern or western sides of a paperbark swamp, or in the swamp, where there was significant fire activity. As a result, fire was able to escape from that part of the swamp with no resources there to prevent it or reduce its impact. The coroner queried whether the fatal outcome would have occurred if the fire’s impact had even been reduced slightly. The Deputy State Coroner had referred in the coronial report to the \\"very strident\\" public criticism of volunteer Incident Management Teams that had occurred. However, his concluding remarks were: \\"The CFS have effected much change since this incident. Recommendations made in two separate inquiries – namely Project Phoenix and the inquiry conducted by Dr Bob Smith – have been, or are being, implemented. In addition, a number of initiatives have been implemented that have resulted in more effective and timely communication in incident settings. The implementation of change is to be applauded. The response of the Country Fire Service to this incident and that of its Chief Officer, Mr Euan Ferguson, has, in my view, been exemplary.\\" ==NotesReferencesExternal links== Category:Disasters in South Australia Category:2005 in Australia Category:2005 wildfires Category:Bushfires in South Australia Category:South Australian Country Fire Service Category:2000s in South Australia Category:Eyre Peninsula Category:January 2005 events in Oceania ","title":"Eyre Peninsula bushfire, 2005"},{"id":"12360535","text":"Knightro is the official mascot of the University of Central Florida, and its sports teams, the Knights.Knightro is born Knightro debuted in 1994, and appears at UCF sporting events and also appears at UCF-related functions.

A number of drawings were submitted by Trey Gordon. With Linda Gooch, Gordon and SGA commissioned Metropolis Graphics to sketch a knight. UCF's first mascot had been the Citronaut in 1969. The first costume was made by Costume World, of Pompano Beach. Gordon filled the mascot position during that first season of 1994-95. At the start of the 1995-96 season, Trey recruited a freshman engineering student named Jay Lovelace to join him. Lovelace would fill the position of Knightro for four more years. In 1996, a new Knightro was created by a Disney character developer, and the female \\"Glycerin\\" was added. But after two years, the costumes had fallen apart. In 1998, Dave Minichello, of Wizzards Production, created the molds for the third rendition of Knightro. In 2000, Glycerin was phased out and the glitter finish was added to Knightro's coat. In 2005-2006, a group of senior engineering students, as a part of their senior project, created a motorized car, called the Chariot II, for Knightro to use during the annual Homecoming Parade. Today, Knightro is operated by the Team Knightro Mascot Squad, which consists of 8 students who perform in costume at all football games, men's and women's basketball games, other athletic events, pep rallies, and special events and appearances. The head coach for Team Knightro is Mike Callahan, a former member of Team Knightro. The mascot was revised for the 2007 season, as part of the \\"Knights are Coming Home\\" campaign, where the athletics department dropped \\"Golden\\" from the team name, released new logos, and opened new on-campus venues (Bright House Networks Stadium and the new CFE Arena.) Knightro's look has been updated to closely resemble the new logo, this time with a fully enclosed helmet. The newest addition to Knightro includes his name spelled out on the back of his cape. ==Competitions== Knightro and friends UKNIGHT for UCF Football.

It had been closed before being flooded during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the ruins were demolished in 2007. ==Features== The plaza was once the largest shopping mall in the state of Louisiana with approximately of retail space. Original anchors were D.H. Holmes, Maison Blanche (each 3 levels), and Sears (2 levels). A two level Mervyns was later added near the cinemas. The Maison Blanche and Sears stores relocated from the Gentilly Woods Shopping Center in the Gentilly section of New Orleans. The plaza also spawned the development of several smaller strip malls, and larger big box stores nearby. ==History== The opening of the Lake Forest Plaza was accompanied by much fanfare, with celebrities making public appearances. At its peak it accounted for a full 25% of all sales taxes collected in Orleans Parish. It was one of the first shopping/dining/entertainment centers ever developed. The cloverleaf design of the mall was centered around the first ice skating rink in the state, as well as the first \\"food court\\". As well as the food court outlets (Taco Loco, Flame-N-Burger, Hook Line & Sinker, Orange Julius, Karmelkorn, Baskin Robbins, Corn Dog 7, Aladdins Castle, China Express, Great American Cookie Co, etc.), there were several sit-down restaurants. The mall itself was divided into four sections which ran from anchor to anchor. Each section was individually named: Santa Rosa Mall, Santa Ana Mall, Santa Maria Mall, and Santa Clara Mall, each section written out in tiles on the floors of each wing. The center of the mall where the ice rink and food court stood was the Fiesta Plaza Mall. The decor was entirely brown-tiled floors, tiled walls, wood benches, real live trees, and tons of skylights. Storefronts had stylish signage hung vertically in the corridors. While the mall was enormous, each corridor was cozy and manageable, the unique cloverleaf design kept it in perspective. Original stores included the first Gap store in the area, Leonard Krower, Godchauxs, Morrisons Cafeteria, Sizzler Steakhouse, the first ever Chick-Fil-A in the state, Swiss Colony, Shoe Lodge, Dannys, The Ranch, the ever-popular Farrells Ice Cream Parlor Restaurant, Gordons, Florsheim, National Shirts, GNC (also a first), Bakers, 5-7-9, Merry Go Round, Imperial Shoes, Porter Stevens, Rubenstein Brothers, All American Jeans, Spencers, Limited, Hickory Farms, Hibernia Bank, Bank of New Orleans, a huge McDonald's, Space Port, Wicks 'N' Sticks, Tinder Box, Walgreens (with a cafeteria), Hausmann's, B. Dalton, Collage, Brentano's (outlet of the famous New York City store), Gryders Shoes, Ponsetis Shoes, Oshmans, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, Lerners, Kay Bee Toys, Vision Plaza, Halpern's Fabrics, etc. ==Decline== The mall thrived until about the late 1980s when the economic downturn of southern Louisiana after the \\"oil bust\\" took an especially heavy toll on New Orleans East. Through the 1990s, as the neighborhoods around it deteriorated and became unsafe, the mall felt the repercussions. Originally New Orleans East was an upper/middle-class neighborhood with many well-heeled subdivisions and several large upscale apartment complexes. When the economy hit the skids in the 1980s with the loss of the oil business, New Orleans East became less affluent and much more section eight. Many of the well-heeled residents fled to the safer confines of the North Shore/Slidell area, which in its boom wound up with its own mall, (North Shore Square), which had many of the same anchors and mall stores as Lake Forest. Sears was the first large anchor to close shop at the Plaza. Despite a major renovation in the late 1980s which replaced the by now drab brown, earth tone tiling to a generic white/aqua color scheme, as well as removed the ice rink, it was too late to save Lake Forest. White flight to Jefferson Parish bolstered Lake Forest's competitor Lakeside Shopping Center in Metairie in the battle for wealthier patrons, although New Orleans East (where Lake Forest was located) had a sizable black middle class population at the time. Just prior to Katrina, the mall was left with only one large anchor in the former Maison Blanche building, which became a Dillard's when they bought out the MB stores. Earlier on, when Dillard's bought out the Holmes stores, they shuttered the Lake Forest Plaza location rather than converting it. The cinemas closed when Gulf States Theatres decided to concentrate on the East Lake Cinema 8, located across the interstate from the plaza. In quick succession many of the national retailers closed up shop also. Eventually they were replaced by independent stores catering to an urban clientele. Entire corridors of the mall were boarded up with sheetrock, which while tastefully done, dramatically decreased the square footage accessible to the public. It seemed as if practically overnight the plaza became a \\"dead mall\\". In 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed most of what remained of the mall. It would eventually be demolished following the hurricane. The mall was originally developed and managed by Sizeler Realty. Later it was sold a few times, eventually landing in the hands of Gowri Kailas in July 1999. Today, only the stadium seat Grand Theatre still stands. The Grand Theatre was added in the early 2000s as an out parcel in a last-ditch effort to bring life back to the Plaza. The rest of the complex has been demolished and is being replaced by a Lowe's. The rest of the site is to be redeveloped into a new \\"town center\\" type of development with free standing stores, garages, hotels, apartments and condos and is currently managed by Lauricella Land Company who also manages Elmwood Center also located in New Orleans off of Clearview Parkway. ==References== Category:Shopping malls in Louisiana Category:Shopping malls established in 1974 Category:Buildings and structures in New Orleans Category:Defunct shopping malls in the United States Category:Demolished shopping malls in the United States Category:Shopping malls in the New Orleans metropolitan area Category:1974 establishments in Louisiana Category:2000 disestablishments in Louisiana Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2007 ","title":"Lake Forest Plaza"},{"id":"12360544","text":"WBRB is a Country formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Buckhannon, West Virginia, serving North Central West Virginia.

They are located north of Ainsworth Hot Springs on the west side of Kootenay Lake. Discovered in the early 1890s, the caves became protected in July 1966 with the formation of the Cody Caves Provincial Park. Cody Caves is one of the best-known cave systems in British Columbia, and Cody Caves Provincial Park was the first subterranean park created in the province. ==Description== Stratification in Cody Cave The story of Cody Caves began 600 million years ago when the limestone in which the caves later formed was laid down at the bottom of an ancient sea. Then, around 170 million years ago, the limestone beds were thrust upwards. This exposed the rock to the elements, water and carbonic acid, which eventually formed Cody Caves. Approximately of the Cody Caves passageways are explorable. The caves have several types of calcite formations, such as stalagmites, stalactites, soda straws and flowstone. The boxwork is considered to be among the best in the world, protruding up to 20.3 cm, whereas 2.5 to 5 cm is average. These ancient formations have been growing at an average rate of one cubic centimetre per hundred years. The Ainsworth Hot Springs originate in the Cody Caves area and are considered to be the best commercial hot springs in British Columbia. The temperatures vary from in the cave to in the pool. ==History== 200px The caves were likely known to local aboriginal people, but the first recorded visit was by prospector Henry Cody, who with hundreds of others had come to the Kootenays looking for silver. The caves gained popularity in 1899 when an article, The Noble Five, was published in Argosy Magazine describing the caves as being \\"lined with gold\\". In 1908, the caves were visited by the Governor General of Canada, Earl Grey. To protect this valuable resource the Cody Caves Provincial Park was formed in July 1966. Due to the delicacy of cave formations, the caves can be explored by guided tour only. Cody Caves is part of the setting for the children's novel, The Kootenay Kidnapper, by BC novelist, Eric Wilson. ==Modern day== 250px Today, around 1000 visitors come to Cody Cave Provincial Park every summer. Visitors are guided through the cave on tours that vary in length with a professional guide. There are three tours available - Adventure, Explorer and Family. The caves are accessible to everyone, from expert cavers to novices and families. Special school and group tours can also be arranged. In June 2010, guided tours and cave access had been suspended. As of June 2013, access has been reinstated and guided tours begin once again. For Pro-active preventative measures against the spread of Bats White Nose Syndrome, Cave visitors are advised not to carry caving gear from areas east of the Rockies into any BC caves and encouraged to download and read the website's supplied documentation on White-Nose Syndrome and procedures for decontamination. ==See also== *List of caves *List of British Columbia Provincial Parks *Hot springs around the world ==Notes== * * BCGNIS entry \\"Cody Caves\\" ==External links== * * Category:Caves of British Columbia Category:Limestone caves Category:West Kootenay ","title":"Cody Caves"},{"id":"12360576","text":"Desktop Tower Defense is a Flash-based tower defense browser game created by Paul Preece in March 2007. The game had been played over 15.7 million times as of July 2007, and was one of Webware 100's top ten entertainment web applications of 2007. Desktop Tower Defense is available in an English, Spanish, German, French, or Italian interface. In May 2009, a commercial Nintendo DS version became available. ==Gameplay== Desktop Tower Defense is played on a map resembling an office desktop. The player must stop a set number of enemies, known in the genre as \\"creeps\\", from reaching a set point on the playing field. This is accomplished by building and upgrading towers that shoot at, damage and kill the enemy creeps before they are able to reach their objective. Unlike many other tower defense games, the path of the creeps themselves is not set; instead, the towers built determine the path of the creeps, who take the shortest path they can find to the exit. The game does not allow the player to make an exit completely inaccessible, but key strategies revolve around guiding creeps into lengthy, meandering corridors. The creeps come in waves at set intervals. Each wave of creeps has different characteristics, such as immunity to certain towers, extra resistance to certain towers, and the abilities to spawn new creeps, move faster than normal, or fly over the towers instead of following the maze. For each wave, the game rotates among the types of creeps. Several times during gameplay, boss waves will appear. These waves consists of just one or two large creeps each, that take many hits to defeat. The player begins with a set number of lives, and loses one for each creep that survives to reach its goal (the edge of the grid opposite its entry-point, on most courses). The game will end early in defeat if the player's lives reach zero, and it provides no way to regenerate lost lives. The game can be played in three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. In addition, there are several challenge modes available for those seeking more from the game. Challenges range from \\"The 100\\", where the player must defeat 100 levels of successively difficult creeps, to \\"3K Fixed\\", where the player has to build a fixed set of towers (including the upgrades) with just 3000 gold. There are also various fun modes different in gameplay than the other, harder ones. The voice when a player is asked to enter a score for the high score table is sampled from Ivor the Engine. ==Development== Paul Preece got the inspiration for Desktop Tower Defense in 2006. He noticed a lack of tower defense games that allowed proper \\"mazing\\" (controlling movement of enemy forces by placing towers in their path). Preece did not immediately start work on Desktop Tower Defense because he considered Flash to be too difficult to learn. It was only after an acquaintance created Flash Element Tower Defense that Paul started work on the game. Starting from the \\"Autumn Tower Defense\\" map created for the real-time strategy game Warcraft III, Paul Preece created a simple tower defense game that could be played using only a browser. Because of his lack of skill with computer graphics, he named the game's site HandDrawnGames.com Originally, the game was promoted through the web service StumbleUpon, getting further boosts from popular bloggers such as Michael Arrington. It eventually found its way onto several Flash game sites such as Kongregate. The game's popularity was further increased by exposure on the internet pop-culture websites Digg and I-am-bored.com. It is now available on MySpace Games, and as part of the MindJolt collection on Facebook. ==Reception and impact== This game was featured on Attack of the Show and the Lab with Leo on G4TechTV. It was also in the March issue of Game Informer, with a positive review. As of July 2007, the game had been played more than 15 million times since its inception in March of the same year. The game makes approximately $100,000 per year, according to its creator. Most of the revenue generated by the game is through the online ad-service AdSense. The game itself has been billed as extremely addictive and thus time-consuming by many reviewers, such as those at TechCrunch. Reviewer Michael Arrington commented in jest the game \\"should be banned\\" because of this. Due to success of the game, Paul Preece decided to leave his programming job to focus on making online games as an independent game developer. He and fellow game maker David Scott formed Casual Collective, a game development company. As of 2008, at least $1 million has been raised by the fledgling company mostly from venture capital firms such as Lightspeed Venture Partners. It has been covered by publications like The Wall Street Journal. The game was picked in a survey involving over 400,000 voters over 5000 other web applications as one of the top 100 best web applications, one of ten in the entertainment category for 2007 by Webware. In 2008, the game won a \\"Gleemie Award\\" and the developers received $5000 in prize money at the 2008 Independent Games Festival. In 2012, Desktop Tower Defense was listed on Time's All-TIME 100 greatest video games list. ==Sequel== In early 2010, a sequel, Desktop Defender, was made available on Facebook as an application. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2007 video games Category:Browser games Category:Flash games Category:Single-player online games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Tower defense video games Category:Independent Games Festival winners Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Desktop Tower Defense"},{"id":"12360609","text":"WBTQ is an active rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Weston, West Virginia, serving North Central West Virginia.

In 1783, for about four months Nassau Hall hosted the United States Congress, and many of the students went on to become leaders of the young republic. The institution was formally designated Princeton University in 1896, and soon embarked on a major expansion under the auspices of future president of the USA Woodrow Wilson. Later in the 20th century, the culture became more liberal, and Princeton became coeducational in 1969 == College of New Jersey == Princeton University was founded at Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1746 as the College of New Jersey. New Light Presbyterians founded the College of New Jersey, later Princeton University, in 1746 in order to train ministers dedicated to their views. The college was the educational and religious capital of Scottish-Irish America. By 1808, a loss of confidence in the college within the Presbyterian Church led to the establishment in 1812 of the separate Princeton Theological Seminary, but deep Presbyterian influence at the college continued through the 1910s. The Province of New Jersey granted a charter on October 22, 1746 for “the Education of Youth in the Learned Languages and in the Liberal Arts and Sciences”. The charter was unique in the colonies, for it specified that “any Person of any religious Denomination whatsoever” might attend. The College's enrollment totaled 10 young men, who met for classes in the Reverend Jonathan Dickinson's parlor in Elizabeth. Dickinson died soon after and was replaced by Aaron Burr, Sr., pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Newark, New Jersey. The College moved to Newark in the fall of 1747, where in 1748 a class of six men became the first to graduate.James McLachlan, Princetonians, 1748-1768: A Biographical Dictionary (1976). == New location == In 1756, the College moved to its new quarters to Nassau Hall, in Princeton, New Jersey. Nassau Hall, named to honor King William III, Prince of Orange, of the House of Nassau, was one of the largest buildings in the colonies. For nearly half a century it housed the entire College—classrooms, dormitories, library, chapel, dining room, and kitchen. During the American Revolution it survived occupation by soldiers from both sides and today bears a cannonball scar from the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777). The federal government recognized the historical significance of “Old Nassau” by awarding it national landmark status and by issuing an orange and black commemorative three-cent stamp in celebration of its 1956 bicentennial. Following the untimely deaths of its first five presidents, the college enjoyed a long period of stability during 1768-94 under Reverend John Witherspoon. Military occupation and the Battle of Princeton severely damaged the college during the war. In another disaster, fire destroyed Nassau Hall in March 1802. Student unrest led to an explosion at the Nassau Hall front door and several other incidents in 1814. Witherspoon was a prominent religious and political leader; and an original signer of the Declaration of independence and the Articles of Confederation. John Witherspoon was a prominent evangelical Presbyterian minister in Scotland before becoming the sixth president of Princeton in 1768. Upon his arrival, he transformed a college designed predominantly to train clergymen into a school that would equip the leaders of a revolutionary generation. Witherspoon made fundamental changes to the moral philosophy curriculum, strengthened the college's commitment to natural philosophy (science), and positioned Princeton in the larger transatlantic world of the republic of letters. Witherspoon's common sense approach to morality was more influenced by the Enlightenment ethics of Scottish philosophers Francis Hutcheson and Thomas Reid than the Christian virtue of Jonathan Edwards. Witherspoon thus believed morality was a science. It could be cultivated in his students or deduced through the development of the moral sense—an ethical compass instilled by God in all human beings and developed through education (Reid) or sociability (Hutcheson). Such an approach to morality owed more to the natural moral laws of the Enlightenment than traditional sources of Christian ethics. Thus, while \\"public religion\\" was an important source of social virtue, it was not the only source. Witherspoon, in accordance with the Scottish moral sense philosophy, taught that all human beings—religious or otherwise—could be virtuous. His students, who included James Madison, Aaron Burr, Philip Freneau, and John Breckinridge, all played prominent roles in the development of the new nation.Jeffry H. Morrison, John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic (2005) Locally, Witherspoon was influential in leading the royal colony of New Jersey—a colony initially ambivalent about revolution—toward rebellion. In 1780 an amended charter declared that the trustees should no longer swear allegiance to the king of England, and in 1783 the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall, thus making it the capitol of the United States for a short time. Nine Princeton alumni attended the Constitutional Convention of 1787, more than from any other American or British institution. But even as Witherspoon championed American liberty, he also championed more conservative ideals such as order and national unity. As a result, he was a strong defender of a national constitution. Not surprisingly, the College's revised charter of 1799 called on the trustees to support the new Constitution of the United States of America. 19th century The situation during the winter semester of 1806-07 under the presidency of Samuel Stanhope Smith was characterized by little or no faculty-student rapport or communication, crowded conditions, and strict school rules - a combination that led to a student riot on March 31-April 1, 1807. College authorities denounced it as a sign of moral decay.Mark A. Noll, Princeton and the Republic, 1768-1822 (1989) In 1812 Princeton Theological Seminary was established as a separate institution. College authorities approved, for they were coming to see that specialized training in theology required more attention than they could give. Archibald Alexander, a professor at the college, was its first professor and principal. The two institutions have always enjoyed a close relationship based on common history and shared resources. Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building. Princeton University's position on pre-Civil War disputes over slavery and abolitionism tended to fall on the conservative side, not so much favoring slavery as opposing radical antislavery. This resulted from Princeton's adhering to the conservative Old School wing of the Presbyterian denomination. Ironically, the surrounding town had a lively free black community during this period, which formed its own congregations, including the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church. By the late 1850s, the conservative middle gave way and increasingly supported Lincoln and Republican Party positions on slavery issues.Sean Wilentz, \\"Princeton and the Controversies over Slavery,\\" Journal of Presbyterian History 2007 85(2): 102-111 A Panoramic View Princeton's Campus c1895 The debate between James McCosh (1811–94), president of the college (1868–88), and Charles Hodge, head of Princeton Seminary, during the late 1860s and 1870s exemplified the classic conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin's evolution theory. McCosh offered the first public endorsement of evolution by an American religious leader. However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated. Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion. The debate vitalized the college and helped propel the school to future recognition for excellence in scholarship.Bradley J.Gundlach, \\"McCosh and Hodge on Evolution: A Combined Legacy,\\" Journal of Presbyterian History 1997 75(2): 85-102, Although genuinely loved by many Princetonians, as president of Princeton during 1888-1902 Francis Landey Patton (1843–1932) was viewed by many as a hindrance to Princeton's progress. His model of higher education frustrated the plans of the 'New Princetonians,' who desired a graduate school, not a graduate department. Further, his insistence on a somewhat rigid Christian education program - which limited academic freedom - coupled with outdated administrative methods, alienated those who hoped he would make Princeton into a major American university. Finally, in 1902, Patton was ousted from the presidency.Paul C. Kemeny, \\"President Francis Landey Patton, Princeton University, and Faculty Ferment,\\" American Presbyterians 1991 69(2): 111-121 == Princeton University == Princeton University Class Day c1904 As part of the sesquicentennial celebrations in 1896, the College of New Jersey changed its name to Princeton University, the present name of the university.John Rogers Williams, The Handbook of Princeton (1905) p. 26 Princeton University adopted as an informal motto “Princeton in the nation’s service,” the title of the keynote speech by professor Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson In 1902 Woodrow Wilson became Princeton's 13th president. During his term of office (1902–10) plans for building the Graduate College were finalized, and what had been the College of New Jersey began to grow into a full-scale university. As Princeton looked toward expansion, Wilson focused on the quality of the individual teaching and learning experience. He is credited with developing small discussion classes called preceptorials, which to this day supplement lecture courses in the humanities and social sciences. Wilson doubled the size of the faculty, created an administrative structure, and revised the curriculum to include general studies for freshmen and sophomores and concentrated study for juniors and seniors. He proposed that the undergraduate dormitories be divided into quadrangles or “colleges” in which students would live with resident faculty masters and have their own recreational facilities. A variation on this plan became a reality in 1982 when five residential colleges were organized for freshmen and sophomores. Wilson kept blacks out of Princeton, even as other ivy-league schools were accepting small numbers of blacks and Princeton did not have its first black graduate until 1948. Wilson established academic departments but otherwise downplayed the Germanic model of the PhD-oriented research university in favor of the \\"Oxbridge\\" (Oxford and Cambridge) model of intense small group discussions and one-on-one tutorials. He hired 50 young professors, called preceptors, to meet with students in small conferences, grilling them about their reading. Complaining that Princeton was dominated by \\"eating clubs\\" in which students ate with each other and ignored the professors, he sought to build Oxford-style colleges where students and faculty would eat and talk together. He failed—the eating clubs are still there.Yale and Harvard later did adopt the college model for undergraduates, but not Princeton. W. Barksdale Maynard, Woodrow Wilson: Princeton to the Presidency (2008) Wilson promoted the leadership model, whereby the college focused on training a small cadre of undergraduates for national leadership, \\"the minority who plan, who conceive, who superintend,\\" as he called them in his 1902 inaugural address as the university's president. \\"The college is no less democratic because it is for those who play a special part.\\" He confronted Andrew Fleming West, the dean of the graduate school, and lost. West had the German research model in mind and outmaneuvered Wilson by obtaining outside funding for a graduate complex for serious scholarship that was well separated from the fun-loving undergraduates. As supervising architect of the Princeton campus during 1906–29, Ralph Adams Cram contributed several important buildings in the medieval collegiate Gothic style as well as a plan for stylistic unity and for development.Sarah Drummond Lanford, \\"A Gothic Epitome: Ralph Adams Cram as Princeton's Architect,\\" Princeton University Library Chronicle 1982 43(3): 184-220, Undergraduate life The college was a popular setting for novels about student life, the faculty and the town. The \\"Undergraduate novel\\" (e.g., F. Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise and Harvey Smith's The Gang's All Here) detailed campus life in the 1920s and 1950s. The \\"Faculty novel\\" characterized the 1960s (e.g., Kingsley Amis's One Fat Englishman and John W. Aldridge's The Party at Cranton). The '\\"Town novel\\" (e.g., Julian Moynihan's Garden State and Thomas Baird's Losing People) typified the 1970s. Other important novels include Saul Bellow's Humboldt's Gift (1975) and Carlos Baker's A Friend's Power (1958).Nathaniel Burt, \\"The Princeton Novel: 1920-1978,\\" Princeton University Library Chronicle 1979 40(3): 215-233. As a trendsetter in young men's fashion, Princeton University in the early 20th century casualized the look of clothing across the country for decades to come. With its elite prep-school student population and highly ritualized eating club subculture, the school was an ideal setting in which to create a nation's taste in menswear.Deirdre Clemente, \\"Caps, Canes, and Coonskins: Princeton and the Evolution of Collegiate Clothing, 1900-1930,\\" Journal of American Culture 2008 31(1): 20-33 In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06 to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.John S.Watterson III, \\"The Football Crisis of 1909-1910: The Response of the Eastern 'Big Three'\\", Journal of Sport History 1981 8(1): 33-49 In 1926 Harvard entered into an agreement to play football against the University of Michigan instead of Princeton, and that agreement threatened to destroy the 'Big Three' relationship of the time. Harvard's actions were based on the fact that games with Princeton had been marred by fights and roughness. During the 1930s, the 'Big Three' was restored, and in 1939 it was enlarged to the Ivy League.Marcia G. Synott, \\"The 'Big Three' and the Harvard-Princeton Football Break, 1926-1934,\\" Journal of Sport History 1976 3(2): 188-202. During World War II the student body of Princeton University became almost entirely military as the result of Reserve Officer Training Corps mobilization, the Navy V-7 and V-12 programs, and the Army Specialized Training Program. Wartime changes opened Princeton to the larger world and brought it into the mainstream of American society.Richard D. Challener, \\"The Response to War,\\" Princeton History 1992 11: 48-65. From their beginnings Harvard, Yale and Princeton restricted the admittance of Jews and other minorities. After World War II, however, ethnic prejudice was condemned in higher education because of the US commitment to democracy. College-bound veterans, benefiting from the GI Bill, flooded admissions offices with applications. By the 1950s and 1960s the Big Three began to expand their admission policies, admitting more minorities.Marcia Graham Synnott, The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, 1900-1970 (1979) Religion In the early 20th century, the student body was predominately old-stock, high- status Protestants, especially Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Congregationalists—a group later called \\"WASPS\\" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants). In the early 20th century liberal Christians came to dominate the student body, a former evangelical stronghold. In 1915 President John Grier Hibben refused the request of evangelist Billy Sunday to preach on campus, but later allowed liberal theologian Albert Parker Fitch to do so. Liberals sought to make Princeton a modern university that promoted a liberal philosophy of education and liberal theology. Conservative Christians considered the teachings of the liberals to be heresy and sought to get Lucius H. Miller, the liberal professor of Bible studies, removed from the faculty and to have Bible classes eliminated from the curriculum. Liberals favored retaining the religious aspects of the curriculum and, since they came to control Princeton, they were able to maintain those courses along with various institutions that promoted liberal piety. They did this through an uneasy alliance with cultural modernists on the faculty. Gradually the hegemony of the liberal Christian leaders of higher education was eroded by the secularization of the university that occurred during the first half of the 20th century. Princeton thus ceased being a Presbyterian institution in the 1920s, as symbolized by the building of a great interdenominational chapel.P. C. Kemeny, \\"University Cultural Wars: Rival Protestant Pieties in Early Twentieth-century Princeton,\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 2002 53(4): 735-764; Kemeny, Princeton in the Nation's Service: Religious Ideals and Educational Practice, 1868-1928 (1998). Mathematics American mathematicians of the 1920s worked to maintain the generous funding they had received during World War I. Unwilling to enter a permanent relationship with the federal government, they turned to industry and to private foundations, but with only limited success. The most reliable support for mathematics emerged from universities, where the funding could be justified as part of a larger program of institutional improvement. Oswald Veblen, a leading mathematician and chair of the department, took this approach as Princeton was in the process of transforming itself into a recognized research institution. Veblen's skill in securing university funding helped to make the Princeton mathematics department a center of mathematics research. His strategy helped to split the field, however, between 'pure' mathematicians in academic settings and 'applied' mathematicians whose interest in the practical applications of their work allowed them to find support in industry.Loren Butler Feffer, \\"Oswald Veblen and the Capitalization of American Mathematics: Raising Money for Research, 1923-1928,\\" Isis: Journal of the History of Science in Society 1998 89(3): 474-497 ==21st century== Blair Hall c1907 Princeton University has produced 29 Nobel laureates. Some of the greatest minds of 20th century were associated with Princeton University. Princeton has also produced several Fields Medallists. Before World War II, most elite university faculties were gentlemen's clubs, with few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.William Palmer, \\"On or about 1950 or 1955 History Departments Changed: A Step in the Creation of the Modern History Department,\\" Journal of the Historical Society (1529921x); 2007 7(3): 385-405 Princeton's students and faculty share the tradition of educational excellence begun more than 250 years ago. The few books in the Dickinson parlor were the seeds for of shelving and more than five million volumes in Firestone Library. The original quadrangle—Nassau Hall, the president's house, and two flanking halls—has grown into a main campus with more than 160 buildings. The “learned languages”—Latin and Greek—have been joined by many ancient and modern languages and an array of computer dialects. Today, more than 1,200 full and part-time faculty members teach at Princeton; collectively they publish more than 2,000 scholarly documents a year. Princeton's professors form a single faculty that teaches both undergraduate and graduate students. Originally an institution devoted to the education of young men, Princeton became coeducational in 1969. Today, approximately 5,000 undergraduates and 2,500 graduate students are enrolled here. Virtually all undergraduates and about two-thirds of graduate students live on campus. Princeton is one of the smallest of the nation's leading research universities. Its size permits close interaction among students and faculty members in settings ranging from introductory courses to senior theses. ==1960s and 1970s== Princeton was hardly untouched by the Vietnam War. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) had an active Princeton chapter, which organized protests against the Institute for Defense Analysis and staged a protest that came to be known as the \\"Hickel Heckle,\\" in which several SDS members demanded that Interior Secretary Walter J. Hickel \\"Talk About the War!\\" Three students were suspended over the incident.Merell Noden '78, \\"A War Still With Them,\\" Princeton Alumni Weekly, March 23, 2005, consulted May 13, 2008 at http://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_new/PAW04-05/11-0323/features1.html In 1971, the Third World Center, now the Carl A. Fields Center, was founded to address the concerns of minority students to have a facility of their own making for academic, political and social functions.Conrad D. Snowden, \\"Third World Center,\\" in Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978). ==In service to the nation== Three future U.S. presidents studied at Princeton as undergraduates. Two were alumni: James Madison, the fourth president and an influential founding father, graduated in 1771; and Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president, graduated in 1879. Wilson also served as president of Princeton from 1902 to 1910. Future President John F. Kennedy began his studies at Princeton in the fall of 1935 until a period of illness precipitated his withdrawal from the university and eventual transfer to Harvard University during his freshman year. == See also == * Princeton University * President of Princeton University ==Further reading== * Axtell, James.

The King George whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the south coast of the country from Jurien Bay, Western Australia to Botany Bay, New South Wales in the east. The King George whiting is the only member of the genus Sillaginodes and the largest member of the smelt- whiting family Sillaginidae, growing to a length of 72 cm and 4.8 kg in weight. The species is readily distinguishable from other Australian whitings by its unique pattern of spots, as well as its highly elongate shape. King George whiting are often found in bays and protected waterways over sand and seagrass beds, also venturing out onto deep continental shelf reefs during adulthood. The species is a benthic carnivore, consuming a variety of crustaceans, polychaete worms, molluscs and fish. The King George whiting forms the basis of one of southern Australia's most important commercial fisheries, reportedly worth over five million Australian dollars per year. The species is also heavily targeted by recreational anglers, who value the whiting for its sporting and eating qualities. ==Taxonomy and naming== The King George whiting is the only species nested in the genus Sillaginodes, which itself is in the family Sillaginidae, containing all the smelt whitings. The Sillaginidae are part of the Percoidei, a suborder of the order Perciformes. The King George whiting was first officially named by Cuvier in 1829 as Sillago punctata, based on an individual taken from King George Sound in Western Australia. In 1861, Theodore Gill created the monotypic genus Sillaginodes based on a number or morphological characteristics and assigned S. punctatus to it. A number of synonyms have been applied after the initial correct naming, apparently due to Cuvier not designating a holotype, or it being lost. A lectotype was finally designated by McKay in 1985. The species has a variety of common names (many now obsolete), with the most common, “King George whiting”, taken from the name of the body of water where the initial description was made. It is also often called the spotted whiting in reference to its obliquely positioned bars of brown spots, with other names used in markets, especially outside of Australia. ==Description== The King George whiting has the same overall profile as the rest of the sillaginid fishes, an elongate, slightly compressed body with a tapering head and terminal mouth. The genus Sillaginodes is distinguished by a first dorsal fin with twelve or thirteen spines and the second dorsal fin with a single spine and 25 to 27 soft rays. The vertebrae number between 42 and 44 in the genus. The King George whiting is the only member of the genus Sillaginodes and is further distinguished from any other possible taxa assigned to that genus by a number of distinct anatomical features. It is the largest of the Sillaginid fishes with 129 to 147 lateral line scales, and like all fishes in the family is best distinguished by the shape of its swim bladder. In plan view, the swim bladder has a land slug-like appearance, with a posteriorly tapering extension and two anterolateral extensions or ‘horns’. There are no duct-like processes on the ventral surface unlike taxa in the genus Sillago. In situations where identification is needed quickly, the colour of the King George whiting is also very distinctive, with a pale golden brown to olive brown top colour and white to silver colour on its underside. The species also as distinct obliquely positioned rows of brown spots running the length of its body, which are apparent to see even after removal from the water and after death. The caudal, anal and pectoral fins are usually a light brown, with some having olive green caudal fins. It is the largest member of Sillaginidae, growing to a maximum length of 72 cm long and 4.8 kg in weight. ==Distribution and habitat== Typical habitat of young King George whiting: seagrass beds amongst sand patches The King George whiting is endemic to Southern Australia, ranging lower Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and occasionally even lower New South Wales. The westernmost reported capture was in Jurien Bay and the furthest east King George whiting have been reported from is Botany Bay in New South Wales (although this appears to be a rare occurrence). King George whiting are most commonly found in tidal bays, estuaries and creeks along the coast of the mainland and numerous islands scattered throughout the species’ range. There is a distinct difference in habitat between the adult and juvenile fish, with the juveniles more inclined to inhabit shallower waters in protected bays, creeks and estuaries. A favourite habitat of young fish appears to be Zostera and Posidonia seagrass beds in protected bays, apparently using the seagrass as protection and for foraging purposes. Juveniles tend to form schools of varying sizes, occasionally schooling with other species, including other members of the family Sillaginidae. Adults tend to be solitary and found in deeper water in a range of habitats including bays, offshore surf gutters, broken bottom and deep reef, also venturing into shallower water on occasion. ==Biology== Diet The King George whiting's distinctive body shape and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, which is the predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate. There is a large body of evidence that shows whiting do not rely on visual cues when feeding, instead using a system based on the vibrations emitted by their prey. Studies of gut content have shown that the primary food items of King George whiting are amphipods, copepods and polychaete worms. Unlike any of its relatives, the King George whiting does not appear to feed on molluscs, which is unusual because in many parts of Southern Australia, the main bait used by recreational fishers to catch whiting is the cockle; a mollusc, but then, it has been deshelled. An excellent bait for catching King George Whiting is raw king prawn, such as banana prawn. They are better bought in the shell and peeled shortly before using, as this keeps the bait fresh. Also rare in the diet are echinoderms, which are frequent prey for other species of Sillago. This may be a function of niche partitioning, as in many areas the King George whiting's habitat overlaps with other species of the genus Sillago. Other minor components of the diet include crustaceans such as carids, leptostracans, stomatopods, crabs, tanaids, cumaceans and isopods as well as other fish and benthic algae. As previously mentioned, younger fish tend to school when foraging, and have been known to forage in groups with other species such as silver trevally, tarwhine and other species of whiting. Larger fish tend to occupy areas with larger species such as Australasian snapper, blue morwong and larger trevally. Predators King George whiting, especially juveniles, are known to be common prey for a number of larger inshore fishes and wading birds. The most prominent inshore predators are Australian salmon, members of the flathead family, the barracouta (a snake mackerel), snook as well as various species of sharks and rays. Various species of diving birds, particularly the pied cormorant are also common predators of the species, as are marine mammals such as bottlenose and common dolphins. Reproduction King George whiting reach sexual maturity at three to four years of age, with males reaching 30 cm in length and females 34 cm. These lengths are used as guides when setting minimum legal lengths for the species, allowing adequate time for an individual to reproduce before being taken. Spawning occurs in a range of areas, depending on the geographic locality of the individual; some spawning in deeper water up to 9 m deep, others in estuaries. May and June are the most common times for spawning, with some spawning events recorded as early as February and as late as July. Juvenile fish are recruited to areas by ocean currents, with studies showing the species is too weak a swimmer to be able to undertake long distance journeys. The location of spawning also has implications for the location of the juveniles, as with some estuary breeding individuals. ==Relationship to humans== The King George whiting is a highly rated food fish and is common in southern Australia and so has become a major component of the commercial and recreational fisheries in this region, with aquaculture potential still being explored but apparently of low value. Commercial fishery The main commercial King George whiting fishery is centred on South Australia from Ceduna in the west to Gulf St Vincent in the east. Smaller fisheries are present in Victoria and south west Western Australia. Common catching practices include haul seine nets, gill nets as well as longline and handline methods. This fishery is one of the most important in the country, reportedly worth five million Australian dollars a year, as King George whiting fetch premium price in markets. This single species alone was reported as comprising 60% of the total annual catch in South Australia during the late 1980s. The fish are sold either whole or as fillets and are generally rated as one of the very best quality Australian fish for the table, and are ubiquitous in Fish and chips shops. Recreational fishery In Southern Australia, the King George whiting is often the sole target for fishermen who seek it for its high quality eating. A number of coastal towns rely heavily on the species as a tourism drawcard for anglers seeking a range of fish and crustacean species, but King George whiting is often the most desired catch. They are a relatively easy species to catch, with no special baits, rigs or techniques required and are often caught from jetties, beaches and rocks; meaning a boat is not necessary. Simple rigs such varieties of running ball sinker or paternoster rigs are commonly used, with a fixed sinker employed in area of high tidal movement. As mentioned previously, molluscs, particularly the Goolwa cockle are common bait, with varieties of worms, gents, squid, cuttlefish, fish pieces and especially raw king prawn are commonly successful. The larger fish inhabiting deep reefs are often caught on whole pilchards while fishing for snapper and morwong. The King George whiting has differing size and bag limits for anglers in different states. In Victoria, there is a minimum size limit of 27 cm and a bag limit of 20 per person. South Australia is divided into two zones concerning the taking of this species, with fish caught east of longitude 136° restricted to a minimum length of 32 cm and fish caught to the west of longitude 136° having a minimum length of 30 cm. In both divisions, the bag limit is 10 fish per person. Western Australia has set a minimum legal limit of 28 cm and a bag limit of 8 per person. Aquaculture Due to the King George whitings’ popularity as a food fish, extensive investigations into the viability of the species as an aquaculture species have occurred, with most initial investigations indicating the long larval cycle is a major barrier to the successful farming of the fish. Other problems have arisen in a parasite previously unknown in the species only affecting the fish in captivity. Thyroid growth hormones may be used in the future to hasten growth of larvae and make such ventures more feasible. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Primary Industries - King George whiting * Fishing for King George whiting * Sillaginodes punctatus King George Whiting King George whiting Category:Marine fish of Southern Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia King George whiting ","title":"King George whiting"},{"id":"12360689","text":"The Antonín Dvořák Museum in Prague is a museum dedicated to the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904). Dvořák Museum It is part of the Czech Museum of Music which in turn is part of the National Museum. Since 1932, the museum has been housed in a Baroque style building which was designed by the famous architect Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer at the beginning of the 18th century, even though the house itself has no particular link with the Dvořák. It is situated in the north part of the New Town, about 15 minutes' walk from the city center of Prague. The museum displays photographs, newspaper cuttings, programmes and personal objects relating to the composer, including his viola and his piano. The building houses a unique collection of his manuscripts and correspondence, thus providing an important centre for research into Antonín Dvořák. Concerts are held there regularly, as well as seminars, lectures, and exhibitions. The museum also organizes an annual ceremony on the eve of the day of his death (1 May) at his grave in the Vyšehrad cemetery just south of the New Town district. There is also a matinee celebration on his birthday at his birthplace in Nelahozeves. The museum also takes care of the village house of his son-in-law, Josef Suk. There are also commemorative centres connected with Dvořák at other locations: there is a permanent exhibition at his country estate in Vysoká near Příbram, one in Zlonice and a memorial hall in Sychroy Castle near Turnov. == See also == * List of music museums ==References== “Czech and Slovak Republics” – Insight Guides, Category:Collections of the National Museum in Prague Category:Museums in Prague Category:Music museums in the Czech Republic Category:Biographical museums in the Czech Republic Museum ","title":"Antonín Dvořák Museum"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},x={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",x,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(I,[["render",R]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/45.md","filePath":"quotesmag/45.md"}'),F={name:"quotesmag/45.md"},E=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{N as __pageData,E as default};
